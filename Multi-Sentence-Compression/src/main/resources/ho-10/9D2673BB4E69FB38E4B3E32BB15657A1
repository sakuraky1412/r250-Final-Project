the hilton was a real treat for this stay in london as part of a globus package , but hilton 's high room rates would probably prevent us from returning on our own .
globus has a tour desk in a small room in the lobby so answers to questions about their services were always close at hand .
in a small room off to the side , 3 computers were set up with free wifi .
the rooms were spacious with comfy king sized bed , lovely selection of toiletries , modern bathroom with tub and separate shower , robe and slippers , in-room safe , but free in-room wifi only for those with a hilton gold honors membership card .
while our room was a quiet oasis , the lobby was large and noisy with so many people coming and going .
what a way to start the day with all of the choices in the hot and cold food areas with fresh fruit , juices , breads/pastries , and even porridge .
the lobby also had plenty of seating in deep comfy sofas useful while waiting for a tour to start or a bus to catch after checking out .
other restaurants in this area are not immediately evident , but later we did see a pub and , of course , there is a m & s store a block away for a quick snack .
the seafood pizza ( 13gbp ) was a work of art , freshly made by the chef at the cooking station , and the large cheese spinach tortellinis ( 13gbp ) were delicious .
this hotel also has a large indoor pool , but we were too busy sightseeing to try it out .
