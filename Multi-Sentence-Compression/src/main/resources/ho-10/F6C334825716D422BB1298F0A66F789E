technically it is in cbd itself but there are several hotels which are in core cbd , this one is on an elevated portion of the cbd and thus if you are walking , you either have to climb several stairs or hike up 3-4 blocks some pretty steep streets to/from cbd .

i didnt had breakfast at this hotel as brissie has several cafes and thus i opted to eat there instead .
rooms were plaid and there was a promo going on so i got a nice champagne in the package which was great .
