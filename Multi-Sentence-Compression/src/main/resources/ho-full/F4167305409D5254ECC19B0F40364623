we stayed 3 nights at the continent and really enjoyed it .
we booked their airport transfer as we 'd never been before , but we took a taxi back , as it was cheaper and just as easy .
i tend to write my reviews as pros , cons and tips so hopefully something will be useful for you as to whether you decide to stay or not .
pros : - great location , right on sumhumvit road and by both a syktrain ( bts ) and a metro station .
-- nice spacious rooms with very comfortable beds .
- good shower with pleasant toiletries too .
- lovely rooftop pool and bar , especially great for looking at the views across bangkok and also watching the sunset .
- breakfast had lots of choices and the egg station was very good too .
plenty of variety to both eat and drink .
- we used the gym too which had a couple of running machines and a cross trainer that i couldnt get to work !
nice view across the city too , whilst training .
cons : - we twice asked the reception and conceirge for info and they werent particularly helpful .
smiled lots but not very knowledgable !
- it can be noisy at times because of the main road outside , but as the rooms are right at the top of the hotel , you didnt really notice it that much - maybe only at rush hour really .
- the food and drink prices in the hotel are very expensive and everything has tax added onto the prices .
tips : -- best to eat outside the hotel either with street food or some of the local restaurants .
we ate at one just across the road ( cant remember the exact name but it had the word 'kitchen ' in the title ) and that was delicious with generous portions .
- if you want some entertainment ( i .
e .
wander down a mini red-light district ) , there is a road that has a number of bars and girls and is fun just to walk through or have a drink at to watch the characters go by !
its out of the hotel and turn right , walk to the main road and turn right again and about 50-100 yards on the right hand side is a street of bars etc .
- if you want some nice proper massages , any of the roads have lovely foot massages for only a few hundred bht , so that was nice to do at the end of a days walking .
so overall , i would recommend this hotel predominantly for its location , comfort , cleanliness and breakfast .
