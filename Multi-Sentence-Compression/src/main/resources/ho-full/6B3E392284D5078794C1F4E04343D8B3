set in bungalow rooms running up the hillside , each room has a very large balcony , overlooked by others , with stunning views over the valley and tea plantations .
very pleasant and cool with a few mosquitoes about at dusk .
rooms are large some mod-cons although they are a bit dated , the exteriors were all being painted whilst we were there and new gas hot water geizers were being fit .
however even our new one was not operating properly ( or will ever ) , they tried to fix and did not succeed , however being a uk heating engineer i got mine to work when i needed it .
you need to be fit and a bit of a mountain goat if your room is at the top .
service was good , very polite , with free wiifi in reception and restaurant area .
it takes twelve minutes from the road/bridge to drive down the track and there is very little going on in the hotel , so unless your here with friends it 's early to bed .
room have tv , no fridge , a fan , but no ac , however nights are cooler due to the altitude .
any noise in the valley ( we had two weddings day/night ) carries right up into your room .
take binoculars as you can see for miles , its a very pleasant stay .
the breakfast was ok , and the dinner was good , but there is no ambience or fine dining here , your come to see the plantations and because . . .

you can go into town and use hotel transport but there is not really that much there either .
i would recommend a stay but would have no reason to come again.
