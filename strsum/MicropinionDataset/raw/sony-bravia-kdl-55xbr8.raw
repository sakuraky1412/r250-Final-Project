Pros:. tri luminous lcd leads to outstanding color saturation. absolute best black level available in lcd. shadow detail that is unequaled in ANY tv. local dimming for unmatched contrast. 
Cons:. cost is high. 
Summary:. This is the top of the mountain as far as LED tv's go. I spent many hrs comparing the XBR8 to a Samsung 950 and in every single important catagory the XBR8 spanked the Sammy. deeper blacks. better color saturation. better screen uniformity. higher contrast. better shadow detail. better motion handling. onboard sound quality. it was no contest the Sony won in every test I threw at it. Yes the Pioneer Pro is the king of plasma but the XBR8 is by far the king of LED get one while you still can. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture quality on this TV is fantastic. Whether we're playing video games or watching a Blu-ray movie - in both light and dark conditions the colors pop and the blacks are, well, black.. 
Cons:. The sheer number of configuration options can be overwhelming. Though really, really good - the fact that there is not a 1:1 ratio of LEDs to pixels makes the local dimming less than perfect. It was also pretty dang pricey.. 
Summary:. I knew that I wanted to buy the best HDTV that I could find (under 10 grand, anyway), and this has proven to be it. Even though I will probably not buy another set for a very long time, I still get curious to see what the next best thing will be. Until someone releases a full 1:1 ratio LED TV or a large format OLED, I don't need to worry about wanting anything else.. 

$$;
Pros:. This TV has been rated as good if not better then a Pioneer Elite. Pioneer no longer makes plasmas so there for it is the best.. 
Cons:. Nothing. It has had its price drop and is now cheaper than some of the other "LED" sets.. 
Summary:. The bottome line is that this TV is set apart from the rest of the "LED" TV's. It's the only one that is not edge lit. The Sony has 2800 clusters of LED lights. That is what sets it apart and what made it more expence. The fact that it said Sony on it is not the reason why it was more money. Cnet sould update the facts once in awhile, ie- prices.. Consumer, there is no such thing as a LED TV. Samsung and Sharp have done a wonderful ad campain to make you think that there sets are LED they are not they are LED back lit. I am sorry, the world does have one true LED tv and it's made by Sony. It is called the XEL1 and it's 2 grand for a 11" screen. This is the reason why the UK has told Samsung to stop advertising their TV's as "LED TV's". Stick with a company that only does entertainment products not one that makes heavy duty industrial earth movers, ohh and tv, cell phones, washers, dryers ect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Black levels, connectivity, setup options, matte finish. 
Cons:. bulky with backlit LEDs. 
Summary:. Absolutely the best TV I have ever watched. Ambient light in viewing area ruled out Plasma and Samsung LED with glass screen. Everything worked out of box using GUI for tweaking with little need for reference to manual. Paired with Denon 4310ci (separate review) and LG BD390. Everyone who visits is amazed. Running out of popcorn.. Updated. on Oct 14, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture Quality, Matte screen for bright room, System sound a lot better than most, number of adjustments available, Connections and of course PICTURE QUALITY.. 
Cons:. Very heavy. 
Summary:. Looked for a long time and did a lot of research before deciding on this TV and am very happy with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture, including black levels. Good sound quality.. 
Cons:. The price. Would prefer to get a higher volume at times. Off angle viewing, though I really don't care about this since I am positioned directly in front of it.. 
Summary:. Excellent LCD. Beautiful picture. A bit pricey, though it has come down considerably in the past two months...Drat! In short, I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Motion Pro is better than all competing motion smoothing, shadow detail slightly superior to nearest LED competitor, sold build quality, better built in speakers.. 
Cons:. $ Price $ Price $ Price $. 
Summary:. Yes it is the most expensive. For the much higher price you get, compared to it's Samsung competitor A950: Slightly better detail in dark areas and shadows, better motion smoothing, less (almost none) blooming, better speakers, builter build quality. Samsung does have more 'pop' in it's color - I have read this is a choosen difference between Sony and Samsung with the Sony side saying Samsung colors are 'cartoonish' and not accurate thought I admit they can look nice (and sometimes not nice)..

$$;
Pros:. Sharp image with perfect color for gaming and Blu-ray movie. LCDs with LED backlight is considered the best. I recommend you to check out http://best.lcd.ever.com for information on best and cheapest HDTV for this year.. 
Cons:. I can't think of one.. 
Summary:. As electronic sales I truly think this is the best LCD HDTV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best Picture out there, Great design. 
Cons:. Too bad I am not able to use the TV guide feature that is included in the television, because that service is provided through the Cable company box set, and can only be used when you connect the cable directly to the TV.. 
Summary:. I have been shopping for televisions for the last three months. I had considered the 52XBR6, and then this one. I was very indecisive about spending this amount of money in this TV, until I test it at a local store. After making up my mind, I ended up buying the 55XBR8. Our daily viewing patterns include mostly Blue-Ray movies and HD definition channels.. My previous purchase was last year was the 46W3000, which now I placed in my bedroom. During the dismounting and mounting process I was able to compare both televisions side-by-side with Blue-Ray content at the same settings.. The 55XBR8 has the deepest Blacks you will ever encounter in an LCD. The LED lightning used in this LCD makes a complete difference in the image quality. In addition, the colors are truly unbelievable and breathtaking. I will not go to deep here in this area because there are a lot of in-depth reviews online that can validate my opinions.. With the LED technology, you do not get the Glowing blacks you get with the regular non-LED LCD TVs. Actually; I did not realize how awful this effect is until I compared both televisions side-by-side.. Even when you want to change the Input select, the bottoms are invisible, until you touch the bottom right corner and the bottoms show up. This is one of the coolest features and my daughter loves it.. Some people have complained about three things:. Price: If you make your research, you can get a good deal these days. However, keep in mind, that THIS IS THE BEST LED LCD out there at the 55moment of the review, and is all WORTHY.. The glowing Sony logo at the bottom: You can turn this off; however, this is not distracting at all, and looks sharp.. The floating speakers: They are very thin. On the other side, I believe it adds value because at this price, you do not want the TV to look like every other TV out there.. I am not planning to change TV set in many, many years. This is the best LCD Ever.. 

$$;
Pros:. COLOR, non-glare screen, contrast, ability to connect to a wide variety of imputs, overall design stands out when TV is off, ease of use in setting up and with remote.. 
Cons:. NOT A THING!. 
Summary:. Every detail of a high definition over-the-air sports and news broadcasts stands out. You can see detail in the fartherest reaches of the picture. On a black velvet news anchor's jacket, you can see the folds and every detail of the design. This is an amazing product. I have a long living room, so this big set on the opposite wall with a beautiful wood cabinet to hold my A-V equipment, really blends in perfectly. I was so worried about the piano black finish being a distraction, but it is not at all, and I've had the television for ten weeks now. I wanted a home theatre television to rival that of a small movie house, and that's exactly what I got! It is worth every penny of the money I invested. Now, the prices will be falling, so I would seriously consider this set if you have a room or an area for home theatre, or if you watch a lot of television and movies. I also have the Sony ES receiver, which has the ability to have 7.1 surround while watching either television or movies. I can't praise this set enough. Every one who has seen it says that it rivals plasma for the color detail, but without the high-glare screen of a plasma set. Believe me, you won't be disappointed if you decide and have the room for this 55 inch beauty!. 

$$;
Pros:. Deep blacks yet you can still see details in the dark unlike the Kuro plasma set sitting next to it. Great viewing angle even for an lcd. The LED bulb is supposed to last ~ 20 years. Outstanding picture.. 
Cons:. It was a it of a stretch for the budget but we bought the 46" model, perfect for our space, for a lot less than the MSRB of this 55" beast.. 
Summary:. Even though it is a brand new release, Sony had it on sale so we were able to afford an HDMI-empowered A/V receiver and a Blue Ray player within our budget. Compare this tv side-by-side with a plasma like I did and you will be won over.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality very good, size is great, beautiful details. 
Cons:. Only the price, Expensive. 
Summary:. This is a real TV, the best of the best.... 

$$;
Pros:. Crisp sharp picture. Wonderful colours. Blacks are extremely impressive. LED backlight works very well. I like the design. The 55 inch screen is a great size for movie viewing.. 
Cons:. The price. Silly money. I will buy it when Sony land back on planet Earth with their pricing.. 
Summary:. When I first saw this television in a local store I was amazed by the picture while watching slow and still images and horrified to see awful juddering on a fast action movie. This put me off the set and I viewed the other top televisions, including the Kuro and the Samsung, neither of which I was that impressed with. After contacting the store and telling them of the juddering I had seen they explained that the judder mode had been off and they had now switched it on. I returned to the store and saw the same movie, this time with each judder mode demonstrated by the sales guy. The result was a perfect dream of a picture without any of the juddering I had seen before. I am not a "Sony fan" and have never owned a Sony television. I only go by what I see and of all the televisions I have seen in the past two years, including plasma, the picture on the XBR 8 is the best I have seen without a doubt!. 

$$;
Pros:. The level of color and the blacks on this TV put away my previous 60' SXRD to shame and easily out shine my 720p Pioneer Elite. Yes the price might be higher then a Samsung but the Sonys have long term quality. Samsungs fail way too fast.. 
Cons:. Personally, I dont mind the design but I actually preferred the previous generation design.. 
Summary:. An amazing TV that gives you real bong and wow factor. The 120HZ, i might not yet be used to for watching Blu-rays but a game like Uncharted or Resistance 2 on the PS3 looks superb sharp on that mode and will blow you away. If you live in an area with large windows around you or watch TV not just in the dark and in the day, the Sony wil l be a much better choice then a Plasma because those guys will just not be bright enough. On the other end, the quality of the picture, no ghosting, deep blacks and pretty fantastic sound for just built in speakers (although to all, I highly recommend, if your gaming or have Blu-ray, do yourselves a favor and get a 5.1 or 7.1 setup).. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb right out of the box ... no real reason to seek adjustments of the picture. Super clear and brilliant picture.. 
Cons:. Since I dont use the speakers on the TV, I wish they were removable.. 
Summary:. Wayyyy expensive. But, after stepping up from a Toshiba Regza that I was never happy with and could never adjust the green push away, this Sony was worth every cent. Period.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture. Excellent sound. Good amount of connections. Nice styling. Easy to use interface and remote. Really big screen at 55".. 
Cons:. Expensive TV. Standard Def is okay. Glass reflects light.. 
Summary:. I use this TV for both watching movies and playing games on the PS3. Its really big screen is filled up with great picture (i'm being modest here) that has the darkest of blacks. SD looks okay but its watchable. HD pictures are fantastic. I've compared this TV's picture side by side with the Pioneer Plasmas and it was really really close. To my eyes the XBR5 looked better because the picture seemed to pop off the screen more and its reproduction of colour was more to my liking. While technically the Plasma was rated higher I felt it wasn't as good. But this is just my opinion.. This LED TV is not produced anymore, but if you can get this cheap like I did its well worth the money. I must say that its style is better than what Sony sells these days.. I can't give it a perfect score because of the few flaws that annoy me, but I can't imagine too many better screens out there in terms of picture quality. Audio should not be forgotten and SONY in my opinion delivers the best straight from the set. It can get loud and is very clear with great reproduction and depth especially compared to others like Samsung which just makes sound.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Blacks, accurate color performance, Looks better than the Kuro during Daytime viewing. 
Cons:. Its big, slim it is not... Plus Only DLNA compatiblity with photos only. 
Summary:. Its expensive, but watching TV on this every night is worth the cost... the image is beautiful, and yes I did shop the Samsung stuff.. no comparison - This Sony blows them all away.. 

$$;
Pros:. menus, remote, color, brightness, size, brackets, buttons, weight, thinness. 
Cons:. audio is low, TVGuide isn't working without a cable box and am not having any luck getting any assistance on how to fix it!. 
Summary:. The Blu Ray display on this television is absolutely outstanding. Hands down better quality than my 50"+ sony HD LCD from 2006. Still learning some of the functions of the remote as it pertains to blu ray. A bit light on the manual for that.. 

$$;
Pros:. It lives up to its specifications.. 
Cons:. Size and price.. 
Summary:. With Samsung massacring Sony in sales (check out the most popular sets at Amazon--usually Samsung has all of the first 25 slots), it was beginning to look bleak for Sony. But with this set, they prove they can beat Samsung at their own game (hi black contrast ratios, LED lighting), even as they continue to develop OED technology. I'm not buying this set, but I do see an opportunity in the stock. Look for the features on this set to soon appear throughout the Sony line.. 

$$;
Pros:. RGB LED. Nice Design. 
Cons:. Bad Matted Panel. Heavy. 
Summary:. I went to my friend's store which provides both lightened and darkened room for TVs.. As far as Black Performance goes, the A950 outperformed the XBR8 in real world. The Ultra Clear Panel gives you more depth than the matted panel on the XBR8. The reason CNET gave XBR8 a bit better score is most likely because of the RGB LED that gives the XBR8 less time to calibrate because it is quite accurate out of the box. But If both parties A950 and XBR8 were calibrated and have them side by side, the A950 will outperform the XBR8 either in a Lightened room or Darkened room. I have seen users with both TVs and the A950 gives a lot more stable Color Accuracy DeltaE across all colors than the XBR8 after calibration.. And it is funny that CNET had the A950 measured 0.00cd/m^2 and calling XBR8 have a better black which measured at 0.01cd/m^2? And CNET also stated that XBR8's black tends to go bluish which is just like every Japanese TVs. Whereas the Samsung TV with Ultra Clear Panel is towards True Black with 0.00cd/m^2. I think that CNET better reconsider about their hyped comments in their reviews.. The image quality is obvious if you go see it in person side by side. The A950 Ultra Clear Panel gives a better sense of depth and TRUE BLACK.. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding LCD TV with all the latest bells and whistles, that looked great in both light and dark conditions.. 
Cons:. Still cant watch a hockey game without getting a "motion headache". Non-detachable speakers are a design "faux pas" IMO.. 
Summary:. it seems that current LCD technology is going down the same path as microsoft PC technology. it definitely gets better, but a little more cluttered with more patches and fixes and cover ups to get the most out of it. I am sure that will change very soon. I have been a Sony XBR owner since 86, and after 5 different sets, I always thought they produced the best picture in any TV category........ until I had the chance to demo the XBR8 and the Pioneer elite in an almost side by side comparison. Truth be told, the Pioneer outshines the Sony where it matters to me most which is fast action Hockey games, movies , etc. I can actually watch the game without any motion-blur-dizzy-sickness I get from my XBR1, and to a much smaller degree, the XBR8. Further, the overall colour representation and sheer clarity on the pioneer is almost spooky..... I kid you not. I am not dissing Sony or it's TV as it is one hell of a product, and many will go for it... and they should. Its tomato and tomaato as far as i am concerned. But at this price point, and if you have a discerning eye, check out the two top dogs before dropping your hard earned, federal-reserve-approved-promissory-notes, and no matter if you choose the Sony, or the Pioneer, or you take the $$$ and go to St Tropez for a month, at least you'll know you looked at the two best technological marvels as of November 23, 2008. Now, if they could just get rid of those silly, non-detachable speakers.... 

$$;
Pros:. Stationary images were sharp; blacks made good contrast. 
Cons:. Colours way too bright, major motion blur; fixed speakers. 
Summary:. I had been looking forward to the arrival of the Sony 55XBR8 ever since it was announced, and went to my local Sony Store in Victoria, BC as soon as it arrived. When I walked into the store I could immediately tell which was the XBR8 because it stood out from the others, in completely the wrong way.. The images were lit up like a beacon compared with the earlier XBRs surrounding it. The colours were over saturated and fast motion left trails. Needless to say I was very disappointed, but the salesperson insisted it was the best picture in the store. I am sure the set needed to be properly calibtrated, and I will check other stores to see if the 55XBR8 looks more like the standard reported in early reviews.. There was also a Sony 46XBR8 in the store showing slow moving nature scenes, and the picture on this set was stunning - correct colour, but no means of checking motion blur.. I am sure most people buying a $7,000 television will use home theatre components for best sound reproduction, so I am surprised that SONY still does not offer removeable speakers.. Inspite of the first impressions, I still plan on buying the SONY 55XBR8, providing the picture is as good as the reviews report.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wonderful clarity when little to no motion was present. Great blacks.. 
Cons:. Remnants with motion and scene changes made this the worst LCD I have ever seen. Color, especially on face, was lacking depth and correctness (probably needs calibration).. 
Summary:. With motion or new scenes, the picture was truly HORRIBLE. Salesman couldn't fix it. Sony Style Store Tysons Corner Mall VA, 55xbr8 with Sony Blu-Ray player playing Transformers Blu-Ray DVD. It was as though the set was over-compensating for the Hockey-Puck effect. You did not see slightly lighter trailing image of what is moving. Instead whatever was moving would leave a trail of - as best I can describe - "Invisible Man" effect of what was no longer there. You could see the outline of what had been in the location on the set in previous frames as if through a water bubble or odd lens. Salesman was astonished when I pointed it out (perhaps because I told him it was the absolute worst LCD I had ever seen) and he tried to fix. He reset the Cinema settings and played with a few other items. Nothing resolved it. Another, apparently more knowledgeable salesman, busy with other customers. No other Blu-Ray DVD's to switch to - I asked (that was a disappointment in a Sony Style store full of Blu-Ray DVD's). Was this ever seen in testing? I saw some of the same scenes on Samsung LN55A950 at Best Buy and did not see such issues. Any thoughts on cause?. Based on this review, I was expecting to be blown away. I've generally agreed with the reviews here on, for example, the Pioneer 800, Samsung A950, and Pioneer Kuro 111/151.. Updated. on Nov 22, 2008.
