better for powerful machines  .

it is much better than xp  .

for example windows 7 boots up faster than vista but it is not a major difference , but actually it takes less time for vista to boot up because when windows 7 boots up you have to wait ages until it connects to the internet , and is ready whereas vista is connected to the internet immediately , no delay just get on with using it  .

also vista has a brilliant design , great feel , user friendly  .

i love it but micro  .

i have seen countless reviews bad    mouthing windows vista , personally i do not see why it is fast , it is easy to use , and it is secure  .

i do not know why everyone says bad things , whatever they think is missing is obviously not necessary  .

i have had vista for almost 1 year now , i is going to write a great review the day that i bought it but decided to wait and determine if there were any cons that needed mentioning , and guess what  .

i found none .

it's good  .

people have said vista makes their laptops slow    but since my laptop has 3gb of ram it works perfectly and vista is very fast too  .

the access centre is pretty handy too  .

the speech recognition feature is pretty cool as is the microsoft narrator  .

if i cannot be bothered to read the text i can have it read to me generally vista is a whole lot more useful  .

another feature on vista is the ability to caption and tag photos and also edit them with the windows photo gallery    pretty good with the amount of pics i have  .

lastly , the sound quality and graphics of vista are solid the interface is brilliant  .

it looks much better than xp and is far faster  .

it has some good features such as movie maker , media player 11 , windows calendar etc  .

and for all of you who says oh vista sucks it doesnt okay the only reason u guys think it sucks is either you are running old hardware and software  .

its like saying a radeon 8500 cannot run crysis .

best version of windows i've ever used  .

on both my new computers , vista performs excellently  .

hardly have any problems and have never had a blue screen of death  .

i find features such as start menu search , sidebar and the uac very good and feel lost without them while working on my works computer with xp .

i love this operating system runing it on a laptop with pentium dual core at 2  .

16 ghz , 3gb of ram , 250 gb harddrive and intel graphics and it runs insanly fast  .

the laptop only cost me 600 dollors new also  .

now that microsoft have released service pack 1 and with service pack 2 on the way vista is a great os  .

xp is so hard to use for me now i find it kinda limited  .

i also love media center it is a great place to have all you music and very easy to find all of them  .

i also get better battery life over xp (almost 30min  .

) most people complain about vista cause a 10 year old printer does not work or the odd program but i personly love it and will keep it till 1  .

windows 7 gets released or 2  .

get a virus and then will install the beta if i need to reformat cause i dont have a disk   p)  .

overall , windows vista is a big improvement over xp  .

cnet is wrong about mac being better than windows  .

windows has been beter than mac for many years  .

you see , windows gives you freedom while mac makes you very restricted with what you can do and such although some things in vista need a bit of improvement , vista is still a better choice then windows xp .

a wonderful thing  .

i have it on a toshiba satellite a215s6820 and its great  .

rarely freezes and is easy to understand and use  .

improvement of xp if you have a computer with xp , dont make the switch unless you have some change to spare  .

if you are getting a new computer , get one with vista home premium  .

it really is great  .

the graphics are nice and there are plenty of customizations  .

just get beyond the reputation that it got , but does not deserve , and try it because it is actually really nice  .

i is worried when i got it on this computer , but i have learned to love it .

i have used mac os x , windows 3  .

1 , windows 98 , windows me , and windows xp  .

but none provide both the visual experience , features , and reliability than windows vista home premium does  .

and with existing programs such as ad    aware , avg anti    virus free , and zonealarm now providing support with windows vista , i can have all the features windows vista home premium has to offer plus a very secure computer updated  .

on jan 30 , 2009  .

before i start the review , i should note that i am running an hp pavillion medua center m8200n pc  .

it came with windows vista home premium preinstalled , so i cannot give a review of the installation/upgrading process windows vista is the most recent edition of windows to be released by microsoft , it has been the target of many attacks , including complaints such as slow boot times , too many bsods , constant security popups , and problems installing/upgrading  .

vista for me , however , has been nothing short of flawless , giving me an amazing system for my everyday needs , like schoolwork , gaming , and web browsing  .

it comes loaded with programs for everyday use , like a mail client , windows movie maker , photo gallery software , a dvd maker , windows defender , and the like  .

vista has never crashed on me  .

on top of that , i have been using vista for almost a year , and i have never gotten a bsod  .

not even once  .

how's that for performance  .

windows vista includes the windows sidebar , a feature most likely borrowed from mac os x  .

it's a bar of detatchable gadgets (read   widgets) that sit on the right side of your desktop  .

sidebar comes with a nice selection of gadgets including a clock , calendar , cpu meter , feed reader , and a weather gadget  .

more gadgets are available on microsoft's website vista also comes with microsoft search , a definate improvement over the search functions from past windows editions  .

now , you can even search right from within the start menu vista also comes with windows media center , a client for viewing media files stored on your computer , accessing internet tv (if you have an internet connection) , and watching live tv , should you hook up your computer to your tv  .

it can download a channel guide of your local tv provider as well  .

you can even use media center to record live tv all in all , vista is a great operating system that deserves a better reputation than it has  .

i think if people really tried vista , not just booted it up , complain about the boot time , got to the desktop , complained about the interface , and just keep complaining about everything , they'd have a better time with it  .

go through all the packaged programs , try everything out , really get to know vista , and then form an opinion .

vista is beautiful  .

direct x 10 makes games/ graphics that utilize it surreal  .

learning the in's and out's of vista is much easier than anticipated  .

they took the best of xp and made it more functionable , and much prettier  .

vista's built in defrag is awsome  .

no more waiting hrs to manually defrag , it is allready done  .

in my experience vista's security has been rock solid  .

i have been using vista for a little over a year , and have yet to attain a virus of any kind  .

with xp it is a constant problem  .

since the release of the vista service pack , i have not had any software /hardware issues period  .

they have all been fixed with the much needed update  .

since the update i can honestly say that i love vista  .

as a college student , i use xp , and leapard at school of which , in my opinion , niether compare to vista  .

do not let old reviews scare you          water under the bridge sp1 ftw  .

i love the new flip3d and i use it all the time  .

aero just makes the windows os look a lot better and gives it a mac feel  .

from just opening/closing or minimizing windows (there are animations) , to flip3d (which i use all the time) , to the live previews on the task bar and the glassy windows , the os just looks more polished and good    looking  .

on the other hand , vista is not just about appearance even though microsoft heavily advertises aero and stuff  .

windows explorer is even better than before with the breadcrumbs feature which replaces the address bar , to the preview pane , which previews most documents or files  .

it allows you to view files like pictures , movies , office documents , pdf files without actually opening them (similar to quicklook on a mac)  .

the instant search (i guess its copying mac's spotlight) is very useful even if they ripped it off mac  .

the sidebar is a nice touch that doesn't impact system performance ; it's just nice to see the date , the time , the battery life (on laptops) , etc without clicking anything (cuz its right on the side)  .

btw the shortcut to bringing the sidebar to the front is win + spacebar , lots of ppl do not noe that also there are many under the hood features that most ppl dont noe bout vista  .

like superfetch which bascially prefetches your most used programs onto memory so they load faster  .

it is a smart program in that it will only do it when the system is idle  .

also it will monitor ur program usage and adjust which programs to load into ram first , which is a nice touch  .

all applications benefit from an increase startup time and just overall , vista is more stable than xp  .

when it first came out , there were many problems and compaints from the drivers and program compatibility  .

but this is warranted as vista is a completely redesigned os  .

now , most of these issues have been resolved , and theres no better time to get vista than now  .

it's time to convert to vista from xp ppl  .

i'm not really sure why people are holding onto xp anymore  .

i mean when vista first came out they had a lot of driver glitches and such , but since sp1 came out vista is amazing  .

i use it at home for entertainment , recording music , editing high def  .

video  .

i plug a ton of hard wear and soft wear into it to do that and i haven't had any problems with drivers yet and the the system never slows down  .

the easy to use interface also means i do not get lost searching for my control panel to find out what my sound drivers are doing when i plug in an audio device  .

and if i need to find a file i just recorded or saved , the windows search in the start menu makes it really easy  .

it is all right there in the start menu , the search box , and the files i searched for  .

no messy pop up boxes and file paths (but it will tell you were the file is located if you want it to) i also use vista business it at work  .

for just simple task really , but it works great on the network  .

full support for the multiple servers i connect to to get much needed shared documents also apple sucks i hate apple ever since i got an apple ipod for christmas i realized just how much i hate apple i'm so glad i got an ipod for christmas so that i can realize how much they suck they do not let you do anything you want to do with their product , that you paid top dollar for  .

what you want to move the music you paid for from your own ipod to your other computer at home  .

should be a simple process , right  .

instead they make you pay top dollar for more softwear products that might let you do , what you really want to do and that is just their little entertainment item they are scam artist anyone who buys an apple product really ticks me off because they support the cycle that feeds those greedy little pigs i hope seinfeld makes fun of them with bill g .

vista may get a bad rap , but in actually using it i have found very few problems stemming from the operating system itself  .

it has revamped security , increased ease of use , and it's a little prettier than xp  .

and one of the cons listed by cnet is that search is not on the desktop  .

how hard is it to push the win key and start typing  .

gamers please do not upgrade to vista if you dont have good system  .

there should be 2 gigs of ram and more than 256mb of graphics otherwise your system will be very slow  .

i am now using vista for more than one month i liked it  .

for my luck everything is working fine for me in vista  .

this is by far the best os yet  .

very stable  .

works with everything  .

my ipod locks up more than my vista machine  .

if you have a modern machine vista runs supurb  .

if you dont have a newer pc you can shut off all of the extra dings and whistles and you will benifit from the vista security and extra programs  .

mac wont sync with my tilt  .

several of my most used programs wont work on a mac  .

and i cant afford a non    upgradeable 1200 pc that will be obsolete the next time steve jobs wants to put on a snake oil show  .

i got a $300 refurbished gateway from tiger direct and put a $60 2 gig ram kit and i have had no problems  .

that is cheaper than a clasic ipod .

one of my freinds has windows vista buisness ,  .

and he told me to get one  .

so i got home premium , and everybody should get it  .

but my brother has windows xp , and he just dose not care  .

but windows vista home premium it has great graphics ,  .

great speed , and just great everything  .

and i have a windows millenium and it is now  .

abysmal  .

everything is windows vista  .

the next windows me its not  .

lets all face it , windows xp sucks  .

because of that i switched to mac  .

do not get me wrong , i love os x and everything about it , but then i used my friends vista pc  .

little to say i is very impressed about everything , how sleek it was , how easy the new navigation was , and even how programs minimized and closed  .

it really gave os x (tiger) a run for its money i heard about os x leopard coming out and wanted to see if apple changed the ui to make it sleek like vista  .

they didnt , and they almost seemed to be playing catch up with vista  .

i dont want any bashing from mac fanboys , because i use mac's daily and love them for video editing and multimedia functions  .

but lets face it , as a student i need microsoft office and all of the programs that are required for my classes , and some werent os x compatible and i absolutely hate iwork and office 2004 mac , its to hard to use i saved up my money and purchased a dell for $650 with 2gb memory , amd 5000+ and nvidia 128mb graphics  .

i dont understand those numbers , but someone told me that is a really good deal (they had $300 off) so i decided to buy it with the money i had earned working vista is awesome is all i can say  .

i hated ie7 on xp , but its like a totally different browser on vista  .

everything i own is compatible , so no worry there  .

i would reccomend it to everyone , even mac users  .

even though microsoft copied some ideas from tiger , i'd have to say they put it together better than apple , except apple wins over the whole ilife thing by no means do not install this on your current computer that is where all the trouble comes from as did for me when i put xp on my old 98 computer , the computer eventually crashed and died  .

vista works better running on a brand new computer hope this helps anyone on the fence about upgrading (if you do , get a new computer)  .

networking made easy thanks to windows vista , finding stuff made easy thanks to windows vista , all around a much more user friendly os which makes you think microsoft is really starting to do stuff good , i do not know what's up with all the bad reviews but i really have enjoyed it so far over windows xp and all the previous predocessors  .

thanks microsoft for a great product .

this os has all the bells and whistles i spent years adding to my computer (gadgets etc  .

) , it's visually incredible , i have added a few nice freebies like windows live free download from microsoft which enhanced the vista experience  .

i have not had any hardware issues as of yet that other reviewers have complained of  .

it's everything i've ever wanted in an operating system  .

i dont care what people say about not upgrading from xp , because they are wrong  .

vista is way better than xp the aero the search on the start menu  .

i will recommend this to any one .

enough said .

windows vista service pack 1 (sp1 is due in late 2007) vista sp1 despite the name , is going to be a major upgrade it will include a new version of the windows kernel (version 6  .

1) , bring vista up to date with the changes microsoft is baking into the next windows server version january 24 , 2007 (idg news service)       on the verge of the release of windows vista , microsoft corp  .

is already accepting orders for features to go in the operating system's first service pack  .

search is better cleaner interface  .

takes a while to figure out where every thing is simple to install and not very many drivers to install at all just have the correct hardware lined up and install the new software .

lets see me and my family love the pc windows vista is a major upgrade and is worth the upgrade and i am happy that windows is still moving foward and has so many 3rd party apps and for mac lovers the only reason mac does not get a virus is because cause the mac is such a dull computer and is very boring media center beats ilife hands over fist .

it is just my opinion that windows vista is better than osx  .

windows vista includes windows media center  .

gadgets and new windows tools i used mac osx lets face it its a windows world so eat mac .

look there is a lot of disputes about windows vista and all of its counter parts but back when microsoft mentioned longhorn there is a lot of people going around saying it is the best windows ever that is coming out well yes and no now remember windows 95 that is it had the same thing as people got so use to just using windows 3  .

1 they did not want another virsion  .

now xp coming out when there is already 98 98se 2000 and me in life  .

it has been around since 2001 and yes peopls are scared to upgrade to the unknown world of vista i took the plunge into the new world of vista on the 30/1/07 (australian dating) and i have not looked back  .

my computer is not the high end type it is just a hobby pc with features that are standered in all house hold computers and it runs fine a good thing about this new vista hp is that it comes with media center as with xp it is seperate and that would cost you more money i will say this finnaly tho people should see through xp how much windows has changed and that the new vista is a better operating system overall so give it a go you never know you might just find that vista is what you where looking for  .

people that claim vista is xp slighlty improved have no idea what they are talking about and no idea about the changes in areas like kernel and network stack  .

it's the ususla ignorance regarding ms products , anyway  .

and do these people know an rc version is not the same as a final version  .

where are all these people that moaned when users started rating '1's to the icopiedphone before it is even released  .

how things change , is not it  .

unlike these many people who bash vista based on beta versions , i have microsoft windows vista business that i got through msdnaa .

windows vista home premium is the best operating system microsoft has ever produced  .

it is easy to use and has all the features you want  .

it is the securist windows out and will be a os that will change the way we look at windows .

all i have to say is vista and windows 7 is a thing to learn not some easy basic system like 98 and xp they have a 180 page book on how to use vista/7 you just gotta learn it  .

its to easy  .

bottom line is vista is hated because it had some bugs at first when it launched and people with old software they had been using since win 98 had troubles running it  .

i've got 3 laptops and 2 desktops that have all been running vista since 2007 and have been doing well (3 of those machines are 64bit too)  .

boot times are longest on the laptops due to the 5400 rpm hard drives but are all still within 30    45 seconds  .

the fastest desktop startup is actually a junky 250gb refurbished hard drive with an amd athlon x2 at 2  .

7ghz and 2gb of 800mhz ddr2 (pc6400) with a boot time under 25 seconds both desktops are hooked to tvs and serve as all around media centers hosting videos , music , pictures and serving as dvrs and are absolutely flawless .

windows vista home preminum is very nice  .

not any problems and good software .

windows vista home premium does not put search on the desktop (it's buried within applications , within the start menu) rofl why because you mac fan boys cant handle it  .

worth it  .

xp is getting fazed out eventually  .

go with vista home prem  .

or ultimate .

windows vista home premium and ultimate are very good operating systems  .

contrary to popular belief , on any system with more than 1gb of memory and with a reasonable processor and graphics card inside of it (reasonable being anything newer than an ati x300 video card and a p4 processor) , it is actually faster on most things than windows xp mce is i have had some problems with vista home premium , however those have always been of my own creation (poking around and deleting files that i should have left alone) or from installing applications that were made for earlier than xp that mess with other programs on the computer due to incompatibilities between the two pieces of software , not incompatibilities with vista itself it is also handy that you no longer have to have a bunch of media players installed on vista , media center (unless you are watching extremely rare and exceptional formats) is able to handle everything you throw at it , from divx to  .

264 codecs just one word of warning to anyone who is planning on running vista   it is a little memory hungry (especially when security software is installed) so make sure that if you are buying a laptop , you totally max out the memory inside of it  .

same thing for a desktop system   max out the memory  .

trust me , you will save yourself loads of headaches later .

when i had first booted into the microsoft's new windows operating system , vista , i is shocked and amazed at the brilliant new interface  .

note that the interface is as well customizeable  .

windows explorer integrates a new folder search box in the windows' ribbons  .

a small issue had arised while browsing the new interface , though  .

the new windows do not have the traditional ribbon that contains the drop    down menus of   file , edit , view , and help that previouse versions of microsoft windows integrated  .

this is true on windows vista in all explorer windows ; including windows media player , internet explorer , and microsoft office 2007  .

on older versions of microsoft office , such as office 2003 and possibly other software , this ribbon with all of the drop    down menus is integrated into the individual application ; not a part of windows explorer other than this , with good system hardware , windows vista is capable of doing even more than windows xp  .

vista works perfectly well on my dell xps m1530 notebook pc  .

it runs with a 2  .

4ghz 3mb l2 cache ; 4gb of ram ; 256mb nvidia graphics / video card ; 802  .

11 a/bg/n wi    fi ; and a 250gb hdd @ 5400 rpm  .

if you want vista to work well , you cannot have a shallow wallet and buy budget laptop and desktop pc's .

i think that if you have the right engine to power this os , then you should be at least a little satisfied  .

i think a great combo is vista+office 2007  .

while on a projector , you can do other work at the same time without enterrupting the slideshow with powerpoint for example  .

you can just put the mouse on the slideshow toolbar and see a live fee of what's going on  .

( kinda hard to explain sorry) .

i've been using windows vista home premium for about 3 weeks now and i love everything about it so far  .

i have not had one problem out of it since i found the 2 drivers i needed for everything to work properly  .

it's as if my computer is brand new  .

a lot faster than xp and seems to use a lot less resources too  .

i have a dell 1  .

1ghz amd athlon processor with 2gb of ram  .

really the only thing i have seen is for some reason about your computer info it says my processor is a 1  .

6ghz pentium m processor  .

i am kind of sad i am giving this computer to my parents now lol i just purchased a brand new hp laptop 2  .

5ghz dual core processor with 4 gb of ram with the windows vista 64    bit ultimate version hopefully it works just as well as this one is when it gets here .

windows vista is really not that bad , there are too many new features to list , and great performance .

i barely have anything to complain about  .

people have said that they cannot access their folders for security , but i ordered my computer from dell and they let me personalize it  .

i got to pick the security program i wanted and it is already installed when i got the computer  .

i love how you get a little preview of the window when it's minimized , and how you can access the desktop with a single button  .

the vista backgrounds and sample pictures are incredible , i enjoy them very much  .

the whole layout and design is so much sleeker and better than xp  .

of course , if a building is blowing up , and there is a wheelbarrow of windows vista os's and a wheelbarrow of windows xp os's , and i had 30 seconds to take either wheelbarrow , i would definitely take the vistas  .

i do not understand the complaints of several vista users , i have thoroughly enjoyed my vista experience .

if your going to upgrade to vista , atleast start with the home premium  .

i started with the home basic and it isnt that great compared to the higher value os options such as premium and ultimate .

vista is great for if you are wanting to go surf the net or play a game or watch a movie , aka (home use)  .

for office use on the other hand , not so great  .

its not something you would want while at working trying to upload a program you rely on for work .

first let me say i installed vista when it first came out and had network problems and driver issues  .

i went back to xp for a while now i have installed it on a dell e510 with a p4 3  .

0ghz cpu and 2  .

5 gb ram and it does very well  .

i still use the intel graphics but find them more than capable to handle vista aero i do not play games on it but video has been very good and office 2003 works great with vista  .

i like the side bar widgets  .

microsoft could have come up with a os that worked with older computers better but then people would have said vista did not advance enough  .

i think this is were os are going , its why leopard which i just installed too is taking home computers  .

i think maybe linux which i have tried is better suited to business were change comes along slower than home user's tech  .

i would say that older computers should avoid vista and stick with xp  .

but if you have a pretty good computer i think vista will change your mind about how you look at windows  .

i think vista is a great overall operating system  .

i've been running it for months now , and i've only had one issue , with an epyson printer , and it's driver , but it is easily fixable  .

i think vista is a step in the right direction for microsoft , and i know that i'm never going back to xp bring on windows 7  .

the positives out weigh any negatives you come up with  .

get ready multi    media with boxes as cheap as $500 w/os (see hp slimline) , everyone wins  .

the real gain will be the gamers and the software users who will make use of the new internals  .

this will allow quicker design and turn around time for developers over the next year  .

user benufits big time .

while waiting for my new computer to be delivered i is very concerned about having chosen vista home premium as my new os after reading many confilicting reviews after using the operating system i can honestly say that it's a great system  .

i think most of the people that are having problems are those that upgraded from xp and installed vista on systems that are not capable of handling it i purchased a dell inspiron 1520 with a 2ghz intel core 2 duo processor , 3gb of ram , and a 120gb 7200rpm hard drive  .

i also opted for 256mg of ram for my video  .

vista home premium can see up to 3  .

3gb of ram  .

i think anyone who goes for vista should have at least 2gb of ram  .

the system definitely is a power hog because of all the video effects if you have xp stay with it , but if you're getting a new pc vista is great  .

i'm glad i went for it .

the is the best windows ever  .

it has so many functions built in  .

media center , photo editing , movie maker , performance and tuning , side bar , start menu search  .

this list can continue microsoft really hit it out of the park with this one make sure you do not put it on weak hardware and you will love it  .

there is no comparison .

i have used ms operating systems from way back in the 3  .

0 days  .

the worst product to date being the millenium edition (i am not so sure why any one can say this is a bad product , unless they have old equipment that is not compatible , but even then this is a new product and like everything else it promotes change and advancement or its supposed to)  .

this is far from the millenium edition  .

it performs very well and really takes advantage of the new computer technologies available now with dual cores and speedy memory  .

i put off buying a new computer because my colleague showed such dissappointment with vista  .

well i needed a computer in order to complete a program and i had to send my trusty laptop away for repair so i needed a computer in order to complete extract logic for the program  .

well i needed a pc and currently all pc's have vista  .

so i is some what forced to buy one with vista  .

to my suprise , it is no where near as bad as my collegue stated  .

visual studio , sql server dev edition 2005 all installed and operate without a problem (there were however , updates that needed to occur that is alerted to me by vista and downloaded easily  .

i had a problem using my vpn in order to log into the server at work , but that is easily remedied by installing microsofts virtual pc  .

all of my software that could not work in vista , work on the virtual pc (well the only software that really was not compatible with vista is my jobs vpn)  .

it is really cool to be able to use more than one operating system at once with no resource hit and for free  .

i really do not have any problems with vista because anything that i use in vista that is incompatible i just use on my virtual pc as a programmer it is sometimes very boring looking at the pc with drab colors and the same old ms blue  .

vista adds a very nice polish and makes sitting in front of the pc fun again  .

i would say if you purchase a new pc with a dual core and a good amount of memory 2gigs or more , i see no reason why you would not enjoy vista , unless of course you have a bunch of legacy devices that need new drivers , and may have abandoned making any updated drivers by the manufacturers for newer products  .

i also bought office 2007 and being also an access db developer there is a far greater learning curve from office xp to office 2007 , than from xp pro to vista home premium  .

i give it an 9 because there is always room for improvment , very solid product though and no bugs that i have run into yet and no reason to thwart a purchase of a new machine , if anything it should make one ethusiastic in purchasing a new machine .

windows vista home premium is an amazing operating system , with many new features  .

it is probably the most secure version of windows ever  .

if you are very secure of your files wait until the first service pack .

this is what i've always wanted in an os  .

vista is the best  .

add media center and the gadgets , and i've rekindled my love for computers  .

the only thing i do not like is the constant questions  .

is this ok , is that ok  .

just shut up and work  .

but once you get by the row of questioning , it is the greatest os of all time .

generally this is a great os for home users    graduating from windows xp home ed  .

but no fax  .

why  .

i have to say i is hesitante to get vista until i downloaded rc1  .

from there i could not wait to build a new machine and get a new copy of the os when it hit the stores  .

it is solid , looks great and simple to use  .

search is so easy and fast  .

i have both a mac and pc , and i have to say i barely use my mac anymore  .

i know a lot of mac fanboys out there think it's the best os , but to me they have a lot to learn from windows  .

previews pains , backup , search all better in vista than mac  .

hell they were better in xp too  .

i hvae had no issues getting any old software to run on vista  .

printers and all my other hardware works great  .

i just wish microsoft would get into promoting the gadgets more  .

there are not enough qualty gadgets .

in my opinion , vista is the best os yet from microsoft  .

the new aero interface makes apple's look like outdated , and the flip 3d is incredible  .

the new media center looks better , and has more features  .

i absoutley love the segoe ui font , it's so easy to read , and looks good printed  .

i'm not trying to be a microsoft fan , so there are downsides  .

those stuck with intergrated graphics cards (apparently many people , even me) probably cannot run aero , unless it is very recent  .

seriously , vista doe not have that high hardware requirements , you can get a $400 pc at fry's with enough power for home premium  .

and who actually faxes today  .

email and instant messenging make it so easier nowadays  .

to sum up , vista has some flaws , but its pretty good .

as i said windows vista is not a bad operating system , i know this from working with them and comparing their components for self puposes however i don't think that if you are looking to upgrade to vista it would be a good idea  .

because this would mean that you are using a windows xp or something older  .

and installing vista would not be good for the computer , becuase the hardware is not up to date  .

and the few things that vista improved on will slow down your system and make things worse though if you are looking to buy a computer vista is a great deal , in the past apple is superior to windows in the layout and design , but now vista has what is needed to compete with that and as always supirior hardwre vista becmae more compatible with newer programs , but less compatible with old ones , so if you plan on only buying a tower , (the actual computer) then you might as well throw your money in the dumpster , because your printer and software (which is your cd's and programs) might not work , in which case you might have to buy all new computer accessories if you are starting from scratch then go for it , but like i said vista did not make vast improvements in hardware  .

so if you're thinking it will run faster then and xp , it won't  .

becuase the random    access    memory which is what runes programs didn't climb much higher  .

and the distance that it did move is only enough to fit the new features on vista windows vista is a good operating system , but always remember that the operating system , dos not change the computer .

i is slightly unsure of whether or not to upgrade from windows xp to windows vista home premium ; my main concern is whether or not all of my programs would continue to work    only two haven't one feature which would be fantastic , which microsoft unfortunately has not made yet would be to enable users to reorganize the taskbar    which can be accomplished by downloading third    party software which would be nice if it is included in windows .

i really liked windows vista premium is a really valuable upgrade from windows xp and its really worth having , one of the things i liked the most is windows vista home preimum and the aero theme for windows vista , also the instant search is really usefull because it allows you to look for programs and documents easyly leaving your desktop almost emty for computer and recicle bin , the new efects on windows vista are really nice but they should be also included in the asic and standart themes not only in aero  .

i got the express upgrade to windows vista premium about 3 days ago for my gateway vista ready pc  .

i had windows xp before my install of vista  .

wow , i is hurting for 2 days , because of a driver issue with my ati x1950 pro and my gateway monitor  .

at first i did blame windows vista and tried to go back to win xp recovery disc , but the recovery failed ha ha  .

so now what  .

i can stay in safe mode or solve the problem  .

i re    installed windows vista premium and did not install my retail catalyst ati vista ready cd  .

instead , i got the new driver catalyst on the internet , only because vista kept my basic internet settings  .

however , anyone out there with an ati x    series graphic card , make sure you enable a checkmark on vista windows features  .

net 3  .

it is blank , until you check the sub directories  .

ati/gateway still needs to do there homework , because i still cannot change resolution settings with the new ati catalystcontrol vista driver ( it crashes , frequency out of range)  .

however , vista allows me to change resolution , with no crash  .

it's not just windows vista causing the problem , but 2nd or 3rd party vendors  .

everything works awesome now  .

incuding   , harware games , business programs and the internet  .

i take away 1 point for a 2 day hassle  .

i run both windows vista and osx on the same pc (don't ask how , cause i won't answer) , and i must say that since i got vista i've begun to despice osx  .

i hear people saying that vista looks to much like osx , and that is not true , it looks better than osx  .

and what they've done with features is basically just the natural evolvement of the os , who gives a   if its the same as in the mac , you liked it in the mac didn't you  .

why not in windows to then it even features things such as something that reminds me a little of the time machine in the upcomming osx leopard  .

you can revert back to an old version very fast  .

admitted , it does not look as cool as the videos of the new time machine , but hey they had it first to sum it all up i am running windows vista home premium , and osx on my ferrari 3400lmi laptop , and the only thing i lack is more memory and more harddisc space , but i guess i cannot blame microsoft for that .

i know everyone has an opinion on this but if it is only for the fact that media center actually works like its supposed to i would be sold on vista  .

i use media center more than any other feature in windows and its important to me that it works  .

if youve ever used it , you know what a pain it is to get the remote to work right with xp media center , no matter how many times you program the remote , it can never seem to translate the numbers correctly to my directv set top box  .

with vista you program the remote by pressing and holding down the 0 button instead of every number and enter and the chan up and chan down keys , and it works  .

ive used it for a month now and i can count on two fingers the number of times that it has missed a channel number  .

i think this is a great product and since everyone is complaining about it , i wanted to state a positive and no i dont work for microsoft  .

amd 3200+ , soundblaster live 24    bit , nvidia 6600 , 1  .

5 gb of ram ok , my ram is outrageous but i come close to minimum on everything else  .

it's a great upgrade from xp home , nice graphics games for all ages , and re    done software  .

the tablet feature is for better laptops which cannot handle vista ultimate  .

a tablet os would just be a disaster and wasted by confusing the user  .

photo gallery is a total photoshop bridge knock    off and the search feature is well deserved .

underestimated .

introduction/vista features  .

i have been a fan of the windows os since xp came out  .

xp is the most stable version of the windows os to date and it looked great  .

then windows vista came out and i is completely blown away at the new user interface and new features  .

the windows aero feature is by far the most innovative i have seen , and is very useful  .

it always you to view a thumbnail of whatever program that is minimized in the taskbar , it also improves on the alt+tab feature , instead of icons you actually see a thumbnail view of the programs you have opened  .

i have used these two features most often , it really makes using vista a joy to look and is only made more enjoyable by the other interface changes  .

i have not used the windows flip , i feel this purely for graphical effect  .

i another vista innovation i have fallen in love with is gadget side and the surprisingly vast amount of gadgets you can find on windows website for free of charge  .

my gadgets are the calendar , picture slide show , and the terror alert from the dept  .

of homeland security  .

other gadgets include are clocks , radios , rss feeds , news , etc  .

, etc  .

there is even a gadget for ebay which lets you know the status of your bids and/or items for sale  .

while transferring files from a data disk to the computer windows found that one of the files had the same name as one already on my computer  .

vista now gives you the option with click of mouse to save both files and automatically giving the other file a different though easily i identifiable name  .

people have complained that vista is very security sensitive when it comes executing actions that you yourself have initiated such as installing programs  .

i hardly find this annoying or even slowing down the process that is going on  .

all you who complain about this are just either being nit    picky or you just want to trash microsoft  .

another change i like is the start menu ; instead of going through different pull down menus to look for a program simply put part or the whole program name in the start menus search field and in an instant find what you are looking for  .

other programs that complement an already enjoyable experience are windows media player 11 , i  .

7 , and office 2007 installation  .

as far installation goes it is a bit lengthy but other than that it is a snap , those who are having installation issues probably dont know what they are doing ; a possible solution is to try a clean install rather than an upgrade  .

i backed up all my data and did a clean install right from the get go  .

also those who have had issues with vista , your problems most likely lay with your computers manufacturer and/or the program/file is not compatible yet with the new os yet , this will probably change in time  .

if you have a large hard drive , make a partition and install vista on that new partition and you can get the best of both worlds and boot to either os (xp or vista) whenever it suits you system requirements  .

i installed vista home premium on my notebook (hp dv9000t cto) which has an intel core 2 duo t5500 processor @ 1  .

66 ghz , nvidia go 7400 fx card with 256 dedicated memory , i gb ram , and 100 gb hd @ 7200 rpm  .

vista comes with a diagnostic tool that rates your computer components on scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest)  .

the fx card received a score of 1 which is quite a surprise to me and mentioned that the aero features may not work optimally as a result , in fact aero performs flawlessly , so if you have this fx card or something similar , not to worry  .

all my other system components came in between 4    5  .

if anything i feel i need to add more ram and upgrade to 2 gb , as i am experiencing a very slight lag in performance , and regardless , more ram is always a good thing conclusion  .

in a nutshell windows vista is the most stable , functional , use friendly , and prettiest os i have ever used , it is close to perfection and in my view is the mac os x killer , those who deny this are just speaking out of their hatred for microsoft are in contempt that the company is capable of making such a fine product notes  .

i would like it make it clear neither am i a microsoft employee nor did the company pay me to write this  .

i am computer user who did his homework  .

i read a lot of reviews on vista and the comments to them on cnet  .

com and on amazon  .

com , before actually buying and using the product myself .

i think vista is amazing  .

it is a great effot from microsoft to create a more user friendly system that is very funtional , and very attactive .

i like vista  .

however , many third party vendors are either forcing me to buy new software , or are basically telling me to go take a hike  .

i blame the third parties , and not microsoft .

i purchased windows vista home premium because i is building a new pc and didnt want to spend the money on xp if i would only want to upgrade to vista within the next year anyways  .

i is a little worried about driver issues but now that i've used vista for awhile , i no longer have those same worries if you're making/buying a new computer , you might as well choose vista over xp  .

i wont even mention os x since i'm a gamer and dont plan on ever going near that operating system only reason i gave this a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the fact that some minor driver issues do still exist ; but that's not really a fault with microsoft (if youre a student , get the student upgrade instead of normal purchase , it costs about half the price)  .

i love vista home premium  .

all my equipment is compatible with vista  .

only my rosetta stone software wasn out of date  .

rosetta stone is happy to replace my 2 year old cd's for a very small fee .

windows vista is all you need from osx and xp in one , user fun and compatible  .

i would easily recommend that everyone who owns or is going to buy a computer get windows vista  .

i would also like to tell everyone at cnet that they should stop looing for stuff to complain about with vista  .

there are a perfect number of different versions of vista , one for someone who just barly can use or afford vista , for the more caring home user , one for buisness users and one for the user who wants it all  .

and with the search function all you have to do is push the button in the bottom left hand corner to get to it .

we are less than a month into the vista era and the reviews have been a mixed bag  .

i have now set up home basic on one computer and home premium on another while still running xp on a third  .

here's what i know    .

home basic may be the most boring release of an os since well , ever  .

not all that flashy and not as appealing as home premium , but for basic or new computer users , home basic is great home premium adds the aero interface and many functions that xp users have been waiting for  .

as long as your pc has the hardware , home premium is just flat awesome  .

setting up a cable modem is a snap , allowing access to the microsoft site ad its rapidly growing knowledge base for small fixes and compatability work    arounds very few programs , hardware or periphials have drivers or updates for vista  .

but the list that does is growing daily  .

i've seen several reviews on here that stated a need to buy a new printer or scanner or whatever becuase of vista  .

that is not necessarily the case  .

a quick look on hewlett packard's site about my printers yielded info that new software is coming soon that is vista compatible  .

i installed the sims 2 on a brand new machine with vista and vista recognized it has issues with that game  .

maxis' website clearly sows how to painlessly fix that issue it seems that many of the poor reviews of vista are from the uninformed or mac loyalists just throwing crap at the wall hoping to see what sticks  .

its sour grapes , plain and simple if your system can handle it (2gb of ram and a 256mb video card) home premium is great .

vista home premium is a great os it allows the user complete control of the system with ease of use in mind  .

i have been playing with it for about a week now and will never go back to xp  .

the only bad part is since it's new a lot of companies who produce software and hardware do not have their products set up to be compatible but the companies i have talked to say they will release the updates to resolve this very soon  .

all in all i would highly recommend vista as long as you have the hardware to run it properly  .

there is a lot of absolute nonsense circulating about vista  .

vista will not spy on your , prevent you from accessing files , or cost $300    $500 the mentally    challenged c    net reviewer complains that the search box is in the start menu , where it is always accessible with one keystroke or sling of the mouse to the corner of the screen  .

the blinking cursor is active without requiring another click , and even functions as a command line , since it automatically searches the start menu  .

you wo not have to hunt or even aim for it , but some people apparently like that sort of thing  .

microsoft has apparently hired a few people who know what they're doing , unlike this reviewer frankly , many people are jumping on the bash    vista bandwagon without stopping to think for half a second .

after reading all the negative and luke    warm reviews about upgrading an older pc to vista i was not sure i wanted to install it , but last weekend i went ahead and i'm glad i did  .

my pc is over 3 years old  .

i have an intel p4 2  .

6mhz , ht processor , with 1mb of ram , asus mb , ati radeon 9800 video card with 128mb of video ram  .

i decided to set up vista as a dual boot on my pc so i did a clean install of visa home premium on a second hard drive  .

the installation went very smoothly and vista installed in about 30 minutes  .

all my hardware is recognized including my haupage tv tuner card  .

i soon as i connected vista to my home network , vista went to windows updates and did some driver and security updates automatically so far (only 2 days) everything is working very well  .

i'm getting the full vista aero glass experience and the system is very responsive  .

windows media center which comes with home premium works with no problems to sum up , i'm surprised how well vista is performing on my pc  .

the reviews on cnet and other sources are not entirely accurate concerning upgrades  .

my pc is not that new and my on board mb ram and video card only meet the minimum specs for vista home premium  .

i'm happy that i did the dual boot installation so i can go back and forth between xp and vista when i need to highly recommended .

i got vista on my new laptop computer while the new interface is not quite as spectacular as i is led to believe it is functional and attractive there is no learning curve for me i is up an running as soon as my computer is set up microsoft may have made a tactical error by raising prices for upgrades because there are costly hardware issues that may make upgrades unattractive to many custumers but vista is a great reason to by a new computer it's different definitely an upgrade over xp but it's not different in a way that's disorienting i felt comfortable using my new computer and very pleased with the new features that come with vista i'd like to upgrade my old computers too but microsoft will have give me a break on the upgrade price before i can justify the cost of the additional hardware that is needed to make vista the true upgrade it is on my new laptop .

i love windows vista  .

the new search feature on the start menu alone is worth the transition  .

it is also just way nicer looking , smoother moving , etc  .

i highly recommend it  .

first of all lets get this clear  .

you mac people are saying that it is not worth upgrating to vista because is a hastle and you should just buy a mac  .

alright , so why if you gonna buy a new computer you should buy the mac  .

why do not you just buy a new pc with vista alrady on it  .

ok done now saying that the operating systems look alike  .

you have a point there but again , if they are the same then why should you go for the mac  .

im not saying they are the same but im taking the opinion of the mac (jobs) fan boys  .

talking about microsoft copying the macs i mean are you serious  .

they were the firts ones to create the whole thing so mac copied microsoft when it decided to make an operating system dont you think  .

take a windows tap for instance and check what it says  .

edit , view , tools etc  .

who first came out with that ahhhhhh  .

so you see there is no argument here stop talking so much garbage  .

go and blow jobs and be happy your way but dont' be saying things that are misleading to people who might not be aware  .

another thing , macs can run windows , true , true  .

a vista pc can run windows to so basically , its the same thing i am not a mac hatter , i dont' like them at all i have 0 fellings for them  .

they might be great products but i hate how jobs makes people be so foolish and diehards like this through all those aps commercials a a bounch of media attacks now if you have something to counter in this opinion it is very , very welcome , thanks live in jobs world , die in ours .

recently switched from the mac  .

used xp media center until vista  .

so far , i think vista is great  .

the interface is smooth and consistent through out the os , something i wish osx got right media center simply is the best thing out  .

on my hp is seems to fit like a glove  .

great features and performance .

overall it's a very good upgrade from xp .

vamosi , if you want to put review on vista , please clean your mind from any bias  .

i'd like you to make a review on mac os or even latest release of linux    if any    i just cannot wait to get my vista shipped top me .

forget what everybody says about microsoft copying ideas from apple  .

did you know that steve jobs orginally copied xerox graphical user interface  .

(the first interface by the way) what about the new ipod  .

you can only download from itunes  .

my point is both apple and microsoft both copies ideas and both want your money  .

ignore the apple commercial it is way exaturating now i got that out of the way  .

i have had vista for three days now  .

while i haven't gone through all of it i have enjoyed it so far  .

the os looks great  .

i like the gadgets and vista is fast once you get to the desktop  .

i is skeptical at first of ie7 because on xp i did not think it ran that great  .

but with vista it runs smooth  .

while not the greatest the windows media 11 is a nice change  .

plays music and videos solid  .

i really like the media center where you can view videos photos and even record tv if you have a tuner  .

the speech recognition is a great plus  .

not only can you do documents you can use the entire windows just with your voice  .

once other companies are par with vista we will see more driver releases and new hardware  .

yes windows will always be able to cracked or get a virus , but remember 90 percent of computers have windows on them  .

so why would you want to waste time in cracking apple  .

if you do not care about all the little technical stuff and just want to be entertained and a change of scenery and have a stable systen vista is good to go  .

if you have a previous computer then wait til all drivers come out for vista  .

if you are going to by a computer with vista go ahead and make the change  .

windows vista home premium has almost everything an everyday user needs  .

networking has been improved greatly , in my experience , which has made connecting wireless a pleasure to actually do , as opposed to a headache  .

windows vista has been changed in the way it behaves and performs certain tasks , it will take a bit of time to get used to how things have been positioned and located but it is very easy to learn  .

integrated search has been made available within explorer windows to ensure that even if you cannot find what you're looking for , you can search for any file , feature or option and let windows return the results there are several features such as superfetch and the improved search results that will take prolonged use before comments can be accurately made about how well they perform  .

the sidebar is an interesting idea , one of which i constantly flirt with , wondering whether i should use it or not  .

at the moment i have my sidebar closed with no gadgets enabled , but this may change over time  .

vista provides several gadgets from the moment you install and also allows for the option to download gadgets online that are more tailored to your preference i have yet to experience a software , hardware or driver incompatibility  .

when a program fails to respond or crashes , microsoft makes an attempt to find out who caused the fault and what solutions are available  .

if the manufacturer has no available solutions yet , microsoft will inform you and also let you know if there is a new version of a product and suggest that using the current version may rectify any problems one may be experiencing  .

my system is fast at start up and shut down , and i have yet to experience poor performance within my system thus far , i am highly impressed with windows vista and believe it is actually a decent operating system to take into consideration  .

however , before you choose to purchase and install windows vista on your system , i highly recommend using microsoft's windows vista upgrade adviser to ensure that your system , drivers and programs are compatible and meet system requirements  .

the upgrade adviser will also provide you with results that suggest which version of vista will perform best on your system .

i'm begining to wonder what some of the reviewers on this site are looking at  .

vista is a great upgrade from xp  .

it looks great is more organized than any past windows os  .

it is so much more secure and reliable  .

all i ever hear is how its all buggy and has problems  .

i currently have setup over 30 vista computers and have found zero problems with vista  .

there have been problems with other software conforming but thats not microsofts fault  .

they have had vista out for almost a year now for companies and buggers  .

yet they are late to conform to the technology  .

vistas aero and bit locker tech is amazing  .

there is no way i would ever go back to xp after using vista  .

great job microsoft  .

like it or not , vista has released their long awaited operating system to replace windows xp  .

i personally , with the rest of the tech world , have put vista under microscope with scrutiny  .

now , after fully experiencing it on laptops , desktops , and the new touchsmart from hp , i'm utterly impressed  .

the stability is unbelievable    at least in the 64 bit version    i refuse to run the 32 bit version (since almost all processors now support the awesome 64 bit capabilities)  .

i will say some of the new features are a little gui ish    that i as an it professional would care not to see    but microsoft must compete with mac os x  .

overall i do recommend upgrading from xp within the year because there will be many advantages for not only personal family use but also small business on    the    go employees  .

there will be many people saying how it's the worst os ever , but realize if you use a pc (and now that it works on a mac) , there is not much choice as to what you upgrade to in the future .

i have had vista for a year on the new laptop i got to replace my 5 year old xp laptop  .

i couldnt ever shelve that computer , because none of my burning software , work software , and games are compatible with vista  .

i used my 2000 dollar vista laptop as a very expensive portable dvd player mostly becuase i found myself still needing xp for everything i did well a week ago i figured out how to say goodbye to vista and figured out how to slipstream drivers onto the xp driver disk and got xp on my new laptop on the same computer i can now run all my games at ultra graphics , without any choppyness on xp , when on vista it is horrible even on low graphics settings , the same slow computer is now lightning fast , windows seriously takes 15 seconds to load while vista took 5 plus minutes i would have to say that vista is the worst memory and resource hog made thumbs down bigtime .

now days 2009  .

vista is unfairly thought of as being the operating sytem from hell  .

but it has came a long way it does make me a little angry knowing that microsoft is rolling out a new os so soon though , instead of focusing on this one installation   easy to install on newer machines  .

upgrade can get hectic but for the most part is easy uninstallation   not easy to downgrade but very easy to upgrade and reformat interface   clean cut same as basic version and ultimate version  .

easibility   just as easy as it gets features   better than basic almost the same as ultimate  .

support   we all know microsoft support is a nightmare my computer specs    .

windows vista ultimate sp1 64bit  .

gateway lx6810  .

intelï¿½ core  .

2 quad  .

33ghz  .

640gb hard drive  .

8gb ram  .

i enjoy this version of vista but it can to late when windows 7 will be coming out soon .

windows vista home premium is a nice addition to the windows family , worthy of its predecessors  .

while xp may be more stable , vista offers more features than xp could do with 10 service packs  .

the aero interface is sleek and offers a different take on easy switching with windows , but sometimes text can be hard to read while using aero  .

the windows media center is a great improvement over windows xp media center's edition of it , adding much more tasks to make it a swiss army knife for media  .

the gadgets may seem to have a small library , but there are actually tons more online in an online gallery  .

also , the start menu doesn't have a blocky , rectangle feel to it anymore  .

instead , the start menu can be opened from an orb on the desktop  .

also , the small applications make quite a difference as well  .

one such tool is the snipping tool , which is overlooked by many  .

the snipping tool is a built    in snag it , with scissors as your guidelines  .

dvd recognition is not easy in xp , but in vista , with a good drive , dvd's are a breeze to read  .

the start menu has another neato keeno feature    it allows you to search your whole computer from one area  .

however , with all these pros , there are also some cons  .

two in particular can be annoying  .

for one , burning stinks in vista , for the fact that it rarely works  .

also , a lot of programs and peripherals are not compatible  .

that makes old computers a dinosaur for vista to tame  .

do not try running vista home premium without 2gb of memory  .

(for those of you who don't know what gb means , it means gigabyte , a technical term meaning 1 , 000 megabytes  .

) vista is not for everybody , as it site contradicts to  .

so , if you do not mind the negatives of vista , and you have the requirements , buy vista  .

you will be pleasently surprised .

i purchased vista home premium to run alongside my current windows xp professional , sp 3  .

my hardware is an desktop box with an intel core 2 duo , 2  .

4 ghz , 2 gb ram , 700 gb sata , 7000 rpm hd , creative labs xfi soundcard , nvidia geforce 8000 card with 512 mb onboard after the install , vista automatically detected my integrated network card and pointed me to drivers for my usb printer , video card , sound card , but had no drivers for my usb scanner  .

this is a huge improvement from xp which leaves you to figure out who makes the card and their website after running it for a week , using flight simulator x , spore , office 2003 , java 1  .

6 , firefox 3  .

0 , i've had one crash (bluescreen from coming back from waking up out of sleep mode) , and burned one bad cd (i've created several cds perfectly since , so it might have been the media) i find the new aero interface to be very nice , and like the built    in media center which can turn my pc into a dvr (if i had a video capture board)  .

overall , the system has been pretty stable so it seems a slam dunk , right  .

not exactly  .

when just idling , running no tasks , vista uses a whopping 400 mb more ram than xp  .

also , it feels somewhat slower than xp  .

however , the games i used ran perfectly smoothly on vista  .

so i cannot say the minor slowdown is a problem for newer hardware  .

on older hardware (say more than 2 years old) , vista will probably be a dog in addition , if you have peripherals more than 2 years old , stay away from vista  .

hardware manufacturers aren't likely to pay their in house developers to create drivers for their older hardware so , as it stands today , with service pack 1 , i recommend vista if your pc and peripherals are new  .

otherwise , stay with xp the other question is   if i have a reasonably pc running xp , is it worth upgrading to vista  .

i do not see any real reason to upgrade to vista  .

there are a lot of little tweaks , but no real killer app for vista .

some tasks are hard to find and its takes a bit getting used to , not a bad os  .

could use a lot of improvment however .

i think overall , it's worth your money , and remember at some point you will have to buy it , you cannot stay stuck in the past .

if you have a gaming or a top of the line pc then this operating system should run just fine other than bugs that usually interfere with certain computer vendors such as hp  .

however for slower pcs such as laptops and 2gb and non dedicated video card machines stay with windows xp sp2  .

windows vista could have been better and does not seem to have reached its full potential .

i'm very happy with vista  .

it looks gorgeous  .

very pleasing to the eye compared to the 2d    ness of xp and endless greyness of mac os it is a bit twitchy to start with but as time goes on it has become mostly stable  .

i think it well designed and thought out and i enjoy using it as my os  .

note   i admit your system should preferably be hugely powerful to run it and do not bother unless you have 2gb of ram .

over all i think it's pretty good  .

most people just do not like change  .

the only problems i have had were caused by myself fiddling with the registry .

after 14 months of use , vista has been rock solid stable and secure for me  .

had one glitch with an upgrade of some scanning software that put molasses in the machine , but that is due to an error on the part of the isv  .

cleared that up with a system restore and a workaround on the installation process  .

vista's plenty fast when configured right , and speed has improved with sp1  .

if you have only 1gb ram , it is adequate for basic use  .

i monitor resources regularly  .

with shovelware uninstalled and a lean startup configuration , it uses about 600 mb at startup  .

typical ram use running common non resource    intensive applications is about 1 gb  .

readyboost with a thumb drive is a good workaround if you don't want to spring for an extra gb of installed ram  .

it still won't be quite as fast as a full 2gb in some situations  .

a lot of vista processes run for features you're never likely to use , such as tablet pc features  .

it's worthwhile to drill deep into the task manager , take a hard look , and figure out what you don't need  .

the system gives good guidance and precautions if you're thinking about shutting down something with unintended consequences the uninstall feature has long been a weak point in windows , as it often doesn't do a very complete job and some files remain hidden from it  .

use a third    party uninstaller such as revo uninstaller (free) to do the job right  .

it will save your system from getting clogged with leftovers  .

caution    the extra power gives you the ability to screw things up (it can access high permission files in obscure places) the new interface and control features are nice , but they take some adjustment if you're used to xp  .

the same functionalities are there , you just have to find them in a slightly different , but equally accessible , place  .

if that doesn't work for you , the control settings can be set up to be very xp    like   menu bars , default power off button , slab startup menu , run and such  .

it seems kind of silly that microsoft didn't put the option to set up a default xp    like interface in the welcome center  .

that said , i don't mind doing some things completely differently in vista than i do in xp  .

the lack of an up navigation button is disconcerting at first , but the link buttons in the navigation bar are more than an adequate substitute the linked help feature is way more powerful than the old help menu  .

topics have links to where you need to go in the system  .

you can navigate in help quite easily , eliminating the need for multiple iterations of help to complete a task  .

if you're in a curious mood , you can surf the help menu and learn more than you really need to know about your system the kernel , driver model , and graphics engine are changed markedly from those used in xp  .

that is the blessing and the curse  .

that is the source of the compatibility issues that are so famous , but fundamental changes were needed in the kernel structure and codebase for improved security , stability , and (eventual) scalability  .

stick with xp if you are heavily invested in back    compatibility , but future evolution of windows will be along the path started on with vista  .

the old nt kernel has had a good 15 year run , but it's on a dead end  .

as more software is developed optimized for vista , obsolescence will supplant back    compatibility as the main issue  .

accepting and planning for migration is the key to avoiding heartache i have one major beef with the vista release that causes me to lower the rating of home premium a notch  .

it should not be necessary to purchase ultimate to get some of the the most useful features such as encryption , complete system backup , or fax and scan  .

do not do what ms wants you to do (buy ultimate for an arm and a leg) to get features such as encryption  .

stick it to the man and get third party equivalents for the ultimate feature you really want  .

also , it's ridiculous that a really effective disk and registry cleaning utility still is not included in windows recommendations    .

new equipment    vista  .

happily using xp    stick with it , but prepare for eventuality of migrating to vista/windows 7 and plan for forward    compatibility in software and peripherals third party registry utility (ccleaner) and uninstaller (revo) , both free  .

third party encryption , backup , and scan/fax software as an alternative to buying ultimate  .

minimum 1gb ram , more depending on use  .

dual core processor , minmum 1  .

7 ghz  .

vista is considerably slower than xp , but this can be expect after all xp has dominated the world for the last six years and vista has only been out for a year  .

there is still much to be done before vista can be considered as fast as xp  .

one feature that you will not be able to find in xp that is very handy is readyboost  .

readyboost allows your pc to use you flash drive as virtual memory , which is much faster than accessing the hard drive  .

give vista a service pack and a several more optimizations and it will be blazing just like xp if not faster .

well , goodbye blue screen of death  .

im very pleased with windows vista  .

i agree that it couldve been better and much more appealing , but i'm one of the few who have been lucky enough to give both windows vista and osx leopard a try simultaneously  .

leopard impressed me to an extent , but apple's new os had nothing really special , and still lacked competant office tools  .

vista is much more stable than it's predecessors and also had more self    reliant features to repair errors and close security holes  .

if you have any questions , i also bought the zune80 out of respect for microsoft's come back  .

e    mail me at wmyinzer@aim  .

com  .

thanks  .

i installed vista on a separate hd , leaving my xp installation intact  .

i can boot to either os , but now mainly use vista  .

true , it does need good hardware  .

i'm running a core 2 duo , 2gb of ram , 512mb video card and have no performance issues  .

it's definitely faster than xp  .

programs start up faster , installations are faster , etc after hearing all the stories about hardware and software compatability , i is surprised when i found that i is able to install and use my printers , flatbed scanner , and konica    minolta negative and slide scanner without any problems  .

i should note that konica    minolta has abandoned the scanner business and no longer supports those products , so there is no vista driver available  .

somehow vista handled it  .

i did have to get the vista drivers for the two printers  .

it was not totally painless , but it was not an ordeal either  .

also , adobe photoshop cs2 installed with no issues , as did all my other software  .

i suspect that my lack of issues has a lot do with doing a clean install and then installing peripherals and software  .

btw , i did this install using the home premium upgrade disk that i got from the computer manufacturer (vista not available when i purchsed the computer)  .

there is a well    know way to do this , just google it  .

it works the interface is beautiful and slick , a big impromvement over xp  .

it's a much nicer experience  .

apple is still the best , but this is getting close however , i still feel that there is no reason for anyone to feel compelled to upgrade  .

i did it because i had the disk (for almost a year) , and had a spare hard drive and some free time  .

i would not have done it if i had to upgrade my xp installation    the risk to benefit ratio is not there .

vista is actually not that bad when it comes down to it  .

personally i still prefer xp , but vista is not as bad as most people make it out to be  .

vista is stable , and seems less sensitive than xp (fewer registry issues , etc  .

) and vista is also very smooth , locking up is not a very big issue  .

although i will point out that vista's most annoying issue is the endless shutdown and welcome screens  .

i'm trying to keep this short though  .

so all in all , it's not bad , but not the best windows edition .

i am using vist home premium , and really say , i think its a good upgrade compared to xpsp2  .

it's feature rich to make things easier , and it seems to handle pretty well people complaining about it not support hardware should be more directed at the companies not supporting vista  .

xp wouldn't use win98 drivers , and i would say the same goes for vista not support xp drivers  .

the hardware markers should make new drivers for vista  .

i'd say most everything works with xp now because for two reason , xp has been the dominating os for a long time , and also hardware before did not require complicated drivers to work (look at some drivers for xp , some are like 20mb to ranging to over 100mb , where as before drivers just took up like a couple megabytes)  .

i is one of those people before saying , vista is just xp with a flashy interface , but some of the features are really helpful  .

for instance , the search built into the start menu makes things faster for me  .

i just type in disk cleanup , finds it there , and i just hit enter , oppose to navigating through folders to find it  .

same applies to documents you need , just type in the document/image/video/song you're looking for on your computer and hit enter , instead of going through folders (if you organized it in folders)  .

this to me saves a lot of time as for vista needing better hardware  .

do we still live in the times when computers had a standard of 256 mb or sd    ram  .

i don't think so  .

most computers now come with at least 1 gb of ram , and for comparable prices to prices before you can get computers with 2 gb of ram (i think this is more than enough , i use a few art type of programs myself , and stil find my computer operating pretty smoothly)  .

if you're still using a computer with xp's bare minimum requirements , or something close to that , i'd say your computer is old , and invest in a new one to save on time saving those precious documents , viewing those pictures that your relatives send (that are sometimes not compressed) , and/or just opening the internet and loading modern day webpages that are heavy on graphics , javascript , or flash  .

it's true vista requires more resources than we are used to seeing , thats just because technology kinda sped up , and look at computers now , the norm is about 1 gb of ram , not 512mb anymore performance wise , vista runs smoothly for me (2 gb ram and a 1  .

6 intel c2d)  .

i run a few graphing programs , and a couple games  .

i couldn't say how vista handles graphic intesnse games , i don't play those  .

but from using programs like paint  .

net to even photoshop cs3 , it works pretty smoothly  .

i've never ran vm's before , they seem to run well in vista as well vista , however is not all frills for me , i do have complaints about it  .

for one , i hate uac , its a great concept , but it gets annoying  .

moving and copying files brings it up a lot  .

but if something were to just happen , such as spyware installing itself while you're on the internet , it would prove useful  .

i have it disabled , and you can disable it  .

the sidebar is not that great  .

i think if they made it autohide it would prove to be more useful  .

vista lags in some cases in terms of performance  .

it takes eons to copy larges files , to me this is the biggest annoyance  .

i'll be copying 3 gb of data from a disc , and it will say 9 hours to complete , but it takes like actually 20 minutes , usually that is  .

also if you have it to highlight new programs in the start menu , it lags loading the start menu  .

the biggest drag in my opinion , is the price  .

the price is ridiculously huge  .

in terms of being a new os , its just a humungous update (like 5 service packs , and i think the same can be said for how xp operates compared to win98 , but the coding for both is different so thats not really fair to use , probably better to compare xp to the previous nt build)  .

another problem with vista are the number of versions there are , it's confusing , and the differences in the versions aren't even worht having different versions  .

one more thing i don't like about vista are hardware requirements  .

it's so strick on your graphic adapter if it supports this and that just to have a flash interface  .

i'd like to install vista on a 3 year old computer that runs just about everything you can throw at xp , but because the laptop doesn't have direct x 9 built into the hardware , it wo not run in a decent resolution  .

i can understand trying to run it on computers really outdated , but some computers from just a couple years back meet all the requirements of vista except that direct x requirements overall , as they say in the cnet review , if you're getting a new computer , and can choose between xp and vista , i would go with vista  .

it certainly is not another m  .

, it's stable , makes using a computer a lot more easier , since that's the whole point of a gui , to make using a computer easier for anyone  .

compared to xp , this os does make things easier , and thats the point  .

so good to buy with a new computer , bad to buy by itself .

i adapt well to change , and with vista the change is a nice adaptation  .

bit anoying security level stuff but it can be switched off  .

bought basic for my wifes pc and she is very happy and is a basic user , i got home premium for my pc and would load lots of media stuff on my pc and home premium has no problems if you are having woes with an oldish pc i wouldnt upgrade but buy a new pc  .

i'm a mac die    hard and i have to admit vista is really nice to use  .

everything works well and os is stable  .

i bought a computer that came with vista so there is no upgrade involved .

i just got my laptop with vista pre installed on it  .

i expected it to be slow because of the reviews but it was not , even though i only have 1  .

5 gb of ram i think vista is only good if u buy it pre    installed in your computer  .

this is what happened to a friend of mine  .

he had installed vista himself onto his pc and it is very slow  .

but when he saw mine he admitted that it was not slow even though he is cursing vista from then on so all i have to say is it is not as bad as everyone is saying , just give it a try  .

i bought my computer with windows xp home edition service pack 2 installed on it  .

i originally added a gigabyte of ram to this computer , and it ran very well for me  .

i tried out one of microsoft's windows vista release candidates originally , and i remember that i is not that impressed with it  .

however , i have already encountered several software packages that will not run everything they have unless they are under windows vista (direct x 10 , the latest windows media player , are not even available for windows xp for example) so i decided to add another gigabyte of ram to my computer , and upgrade it from windows xp home edition service pack 2 to windows vista home premium  .

the windows vista home premium upgrade that i bought took 2 and a half hours to finish , but it did so without any hitches to my surprise , i actually like the windows vista home premium  .

the graphics are heads above the old windows 95 type graphics that is still so prevalent in even windows xp  .

windows vista is indeed more stable and efficient  .

so far , i have encountered no crashes , and none of the infamous windows has to close screens  .

the updates are smooth and non    disruptive , and once i got used to the reorganization of the files , commands , and folders , using windows vista became very pleasant and enjoyable to use  .

the aero graphics are also quite restful to my eyes compared to the rougher graphics inherent with windows 95 to windows xp  .

drivers were not a problem  .

the windows vista upgrades now have a lot of drivers that are available , and it will automatically browse the web for any driver it needs but does not have on board  .

also , i like windows vista having so many watchdogs that protect the user  .

that is a must these days  .

i also like how windows vista automatically activates via the web  .

that activation will not even be noticed , it is so discreet i did feel that the upgrade or installation of windows vista is rather pokey (it lasted 2 and 1/2 hours on my computer) , but that does not discourage its positive side  .

and i did not like having to spend so much money to upgrade my computer so that it would run well with windows vista i also did not like all the reorganization and renaming of so many of the files , commands , and folders by windows vista ; at least until i got used to these changes on the other hand , i felt that windows vista is the smoothest running operating system ever  .

with 2 gigabytes or more of ram it really flies , but it is so smooth that all this speed is very pleasant , rather than being sort of slamming or blurry  .

screens come up and leave very smoothly , and not in a flash as earlier operating systems did i think the real strength and the best selling point of windows vista is it stability and silky smooth operation , rather than its outward appearance , which is indeed nice thanks to that aero  .

although most programs will run as fast on windows xp as they do on windows vista , the advantage of windows vista is , again , its stability and smooth as silk operation , yet with speed  .

this is so much more relaxing and enjoyable  .

i is glad to upgrade to windows vista for these reasons alone  .

i do have weak eyesight , and any help i can get to avoid eye strain is a plus for me as windows vista continues , it will be more and more updated as new files and drivers are added  .

no one needs to worry about upgrading to windows vista only to be without the right drivers  .

a lot of the hardwared manufacturers have alreday made available for download drivers for their hardware that are for windows vusta that one can go to and download ; and windows vista will scan microsoft or the web for nany of these drivers itself i hate to admit it , but i have changed sides , and i am now a windows vista fan and supporter i did not think i would like windows vista home premium , but i do , to my own surprise  .

although looking good is no reason to upgrade , as far as i am concerned , stability and reliability of operation , along with speed that is nevertheless smooth as silk is  .

when you look at windows vista from this angle , you may want to upgrade  .

i am now glad that i did .

thumbs    up from an industry professional with a 25 years of experience solving end    user problems  .

drivers for much of the relatively new hardware like printers are available or will be available from vendors soon  .

for the real older stuff microsoft just cannot keep making the current operating system support all the old stuff .

as i got this new operating system coming with my new laptop (sony vaio vgn    n320e) , there is no need to upgrade or to buy it  .

as far as my needs   i could do as well with windows xp which always worked fine for me  .

i wouldn't upgrade or buy it however , even if my old computer would have been capable to work with vista  .

it is much too expensive and does not give enough value for this amount of money  .

a big number of computers are equipped with windows , in one way or another  .

microsoft gets enough return and i do not see any reason why anybody would be happy to make bill gates more rich then he already is  .

on the other hand , the folks at microsoft did a good job and they are contributing improving and developing the daily use of a computer  .

windows vista looks very beautiful  .

if you want to combine this beauty with workability , make sure to add enough memory (at least 2gb)  .

for the use of common applications (office , photoshop , corel and so on) , that'll do fine  .

be careful what you install and make sure that the software is compatible with vista  .

i checked on this website   http  //www  .

iexbeta  .

php/windows_vista_software_compatibility_list  .

do the same for your hardware and you will not be dissappointed   http  //www  .

further more   little changes  .

if you buy a new computer , go ahead  .

if you wanna upgrade on your old computer , make sure he's capable  .

finally   i can agree with the editors review .

the hd spin issue might just be the nature of the best , runs well on combo of both as a user that has going from dos 3  .

1 to vista i have to admit this is the least tropublesome windows upgrade i've ever experienced i'm still playing with it so i'm not yet able to judge all of it's features .

it still has a few bugs but to beleive these poor reviews is like beleiving the 5 star reviews on avg free you find at download  .

com  .

those that tell you nothing about the app at all  .

as to this os , if you have the hardware or are buyiong a new computer , get used to it  .

it's the way of the future  .

take the time to learn it before you try telling the rest of us how bad it is or not to bother  .

those comments were obviously posted by fools , dummys or the poor people who cannot afford to do vista  .

for the less fortunate financially , i feel for you and agree  .

for the rest , get a grip and move on  .

this os is a little slower then a fully tweaked xp system with the same recources  .

i hate that it is , but i'm going to live with it  .

why  .

like i've already said , it's the future and it's time to move on  .

more apps then you think are compatable  .

this os is pretty fast , better graphicaly , smarter and more secure , period  .

get used to it or go with a mac or linux system  .

there you will see how much software has to be replaced  .

it's not perfect but it's only been out for 6 months or so  .

by this time next year , i'd expect to see many revised reviews that were initially poor .

at first glance my thoughts were hell no  .

i bagged it out of the box and decided that tomorrow , id install microsoft xp pro  .

by the time tomorrow got here i is sold  .

this operating system starts fast  .

although getting to the desktop is a little slower , once there it flies  .

it shuts down fast and works great once i got it tweaked and tuned up  .

my biggest surprise is that all the apps i decided to use before my new computer arrived , worked like i hoped they would with one exception , media monkey  .

i spent some time researching compatible apps , so i had a good idea about what would and wouldnt work  .

to my surprise , some apps that werent supposed to work with vista , work just fine my screensaver , marine aquarium 2  .

6 + time installed and works perfectly  .

my one problem is in finding a compatible , free music  .

player other then windows media player  .

although not a popular app , the free yahoo music jukebox is my answer  .

supposedly , the plus version of the player is the only version working with vista  .

but yahoo fibbed in an attempt to sell the plus version  .

lol  .

, imagine that  .

the free player works fine  .

this decision is made after my favorite player , media monkey wouldnt work and the new alpha version of this player grabbed only about 25% of my music installed  .

another favorite of mine , srs audio sandbox works too  .

but the interfaces beating jukebox look doesnt show  .

i can live with that microsoft office 2003 went in without a glitch  .

but i did have to call microsoft to activate the product for the first time ever  .

it is a purchased version , so i is surprised at having to call microsoft all the security apps i decided on work perfectly  .

these include trend micro internet security 2007  .

counter spy and spyware terminator  .

my download manager , adobe acrobat 7 pro andautocad 2007 all work great too  .

my tune    up apps , which include tune    up utilities 2007 and ashampoo win optimizer 4  .

35 (which i use as a disk defrag) , both work like a charm this operating system is much smarter then windows xp  .

the  .

security center is one example  .

it knows if my security apps are up  .

to date and working as they should  .

it just has too many new features to  .

mention them all  .

the system required about two dozen updates total with  .

ms office , instead of ninety plus for xp  .

it looks better , feels better and is  .

as fast as xp has ever been  .

of course , thats not to mention that it requires  .

a better , more powerful computer to run  .

the processor and video card  .

need to be better  .

the bios needs an update for vista  .

older computers just dont have the hardware needed to run vista   .

hardware just needs to be better then whats needed for an xp system  .

hell , i guess microsoft and the computer manufacturers are all making out like bandits with this new os but i like it their is only things wrong with the new vista os  .

one , too many software vendors are still lagging behind in development  .

two , too many pc users hav not got the brains or patients to figure it out and tweak it  .

i got this mostly because my xp system is starting to run slow , and i thought that if i is going to reinstall everything i would do it the right way  .

i like how everything look , it's very smooth looking  .

the requirements are not nearly as high as most people say  .

i bought my computer at the end of 2005 for around $500 , and vista runs great even with aero glass on .

after 13 hours of phone calls , searching for older versions of windows , and changing my raid array from dynamic to basic it's finally installed  .

now the installation of the os is quick , don't get me wrong , but the lack of support for dynamic disks is what held me up for a while  .

the tech support agent i talked to had no idea how to convert the array from dynamic to basic without data loss , but he is still somewhat helpful  .

it was not until after i re    installed win xp that i found an answer  .

microsoft support tools and thelazyadmin  .

com helped me  .

for others in this situation , check out thelazyadmin  .

com for information on this issue  .

i am suprised that ms has not addressed this yet .

overall , vista is what xp should have been  .

its very stable , fast , has no trouble running all my old hardware (including an epson printer manufactured in 1998 , visioneer scanner from 1999 , etc  .

screen resolution cannot be set for each user just like in xp (win98 did not have this problem) , and getting from point a to point b in customizing visuals and program behavior sometimes requires going from point a to b , c , d , e , f , and g before going back to b  .

but once you've used it for any length of time , you'll think xp is from the stone age .

rejection to mac patronizers    .

with vista , sure , there's some features that you can say are copied straight from mac , but why not  .

would you rather not have those good features in a new os  .

don't be stupid  .

just appreciate that it's there also , ppl are complaining that it's a resource    demanding os  .

pcs cost hundreds , if not thousands , less than macs  .

if you buy a new computer with plenty of ram , processing power , and a good video card chances are that you will still save money as opposed to spending money on an excessively high priced mac the simple/efficient taskbar , the separate windows with independent menus , the plethora of programs that function on micrsoft oss ppl are forgetting about the things that make microsoft oss better than macs because the benefits are so simple , and we've adapted to the utter simplicity of windows so , if you want a cool little breathing led light (because you're so easily amused) buy a mac if you want a backlit keyboard (because you cannot buy yourself a darn light) buy a mac if you want a touchpad that can do special wand    like shortcuts (because you don't realize that you can get keyboards and mice that have much    easier shortcuts) buy a mac if you cannot handle crashes that are usually caused by your own error (because you're not responsible enough to backup your own important information , and you do not really understand what you're doing on a computer) buy a mac                                               .

if not , get windows macs are idiot    friendly  .

windows has a minimum requirement that is not listed on the box   intelligence .

overall a very satisfactory experience thus far    have only been using vista os which came installed in my hp pc    for a week now but so far so good  .

it would be nice to have web publishing and word software as part of the  .

vista os as documents written using the microsoft works software cannot be opened (when sent as e    mail attachments) by operating systems that do not have  .

that particular program  .

no major complaints and only minor glitches  .

that have been easily resolved .

overall a good product  .

i understand the need for greater security , but i am the only user and anytime i do anything major , i have to remind it that i am the systems administrator i really like the voice recognition software  .

while it still is very basic in nature , i hope microsoft continues to improve it many people bash microsoft , but when you are the big dog , you got to get off the porch  .

the developers do not seem to be spending a lot of time on the porch .

i recently bought a new computer that cam with windows vista home premium pre    installed and i really like it  .

for media such as pictures and music it is great  .

with integrated apps for download pictures and home movies , as well as media center to play them back with , this os is quite functional without any additional software  .

the new aero look is just great  .

also windows sidebar is cool , but there aren't a lot of good gadgets yet  .

the files are organized slightly different and a simply named (ie computer instead of my computer )  .

instant search is great and you don't need it on the desktop  .

if you press the window key and type and you're doing a search  .

the search in the explorer window also only searches the open directory  .

which is nice (as long as you know that is what it is doing)  .

also with vista you can use a usb thumbdrive kind of like additional ram  .

if you plug in a thumb drive windows will give you the option of using it to make the computer run faster i wouldn't really recommend anyone upgrading to vista right away if they're happy with xp  .

the reason is that vista is not extremely different  .

also there would probably be some problems installing certain hardware or software  .

not everything is vista compatible , but this should be remedied over time , for the most part  .

i like how vista is arranged , but if you have xp ground into your brain you might be annoyed by some of the slight differences  .

the uac can be annoying , but is not as bad as everyone makes it seem overall , i love vista for what it is  .

it is cool looking and fun  .

it doesn't give you major reasons to upgrade though  .

i'd would definitely recommend it for a new pc purchase , but do not upgrade unless you have good reason .

i already bought vista and it is awesome , i would just recommend people to hold off on buying it due to unforseen security issues that might arise .

i think that vista is a very good buy , especially the academic version if possible , 70$$  .

its not a piece of software that you should rush out and buy unless your into the latest and greatest hardware/software like me , just because there is no huge difference from xp  .

just little helpful stuff  .

also many people say there are to many versions , even cnet themselves said that  .

oh cmon guys there are only 4 versions  .

its not rocket science ; spend like 10 minutes doing a little research then download vista upgrade advisior and you should have a very good idea of what you want .

i really like this new operating system .

after sleeping on it since jan 30 , i finally purchased windows vista home premium  .

installation is troublesome first i did an upgrade over xp sp2 , which resulted in slow performance (i knew this would happen)  .

as soon as i noticed i popped in the dvd again and clean installed vista , which resulted in smooth performance ever since the first boot  .

i have used it for about 3 days (to the max) and i've got to say i'm very pleased  .

i run a brand new laptop (with amd turion , ati radeon graphics) , that suffered from one poor hour of battery life on xp  .

as i am writing this , i have the system set on power saver mode (part of the windows mobility center) and its about to be 3 hrs since i've been sitting at a wi    fi cafe , with a 35% of battery life still to go  .

the aero experience is refreshing ; its a nice change from luna , that's for sure similarities with mac osx are obvious at first boot ; the default wallpaper reminded me instantly of the aqua wallpaper , with the exception of the color , which is green/yellowish on vista  .

buried within the control panel is speech recognition , a feature i found incredibly useful and will definitely take advantage of when doing those long essays for college  .

stability  .

solid as a rock  .

security  .

so far it seems worlds better from xp ; every change to a system setting is monitored and must be confirmed by the user before applying it ; windows update has greatly improved (on first boot after clean install , audio driver is missing , and upon my first connection to the internet , windows update instantly showed me the driver for download)  .

to wrap this up microsoft seems to have done a good job so far  .

let's hope we do not have to suffer from years to come of endless critical updates to cover vulnerabilities like those found in xp .

i just got my new laptop with included windows vista home premium  .

it's great software for organizing all your documents , pictures , videos , and pretty much everything else the one thing that really gets on my nerves is how at least half of the tasks i do requires my permission to proceed  .

and on half of those permission requests there is no box to check telling it that it's okay to complete this certain task  .

therefore everytime you do that , it will ask you again this is unsecure , do you wish to continue  .

other than that it's amazing software for neatly organizing all your things .

how can i label both summary , pros and cons all the same way with this os  .

it's because it brings a lot of great stuff to the table and it's a blast to use , and the new media center is simply amazing  .

however , not everything is without a hitch , but that should change fairly soon  .

already i've seen a few things that did not work with pre    release versions of vista fixed  .

it's definitely not the slam dunk that windows xp is when it first came out , but nonetheless , it's worth it .

very very good os  .

a very nice interface , you will never want to go back to the xp interface  .

i have intel core 2 duo , and  .

99 gb of ram , and i is surprised at how fast it is the first time i used it  .

the only thing that takes time to catch up is the search , the first time you use it , it is slow  .

but eventually it gets very fast  .

the only bad things are the slightly annoying security pop ups that need your attention before you do some things , but it's all for your security , and if that's what it takes to keep my computer from getting infected , i'll deal with it  .

compatibilty issues are another problem , when i installed it i had no sound and it did not recognize my sound device (i have a laptop so the speakers are built in) , but microsoft is very helpful in getting them up and working again  .

the one thing i hate is that windows vista is compatible with only some of the major malwarae providers , i had mcafee , a very common security program , and when i installed it before knowing that visa is only compatible with some providers , my computer messed up and i had to boot it in safe mode and uninstall it , then everything is fine  .

so don't worry if you don't have a security program that's compatible , windows one care lets you have a free 90 day trial and you can download it anytime so you do not have to run out and buy one  .

once care is very easy to use and keeps your computer in tip top shape  .

other than that , windows vista is a very fine os  .

you will never want to go back .

after installing vista home premium on my pc , i found it to perform better all around then xp (even networks speeds increased)  .

i recommend vista to any pc/windows user , not only because it looks better , but because the performance and features it offers are great as a video editor , i work with the mac os x software all the time at work  .

i can say that vista is almost a duplicated version of os x  .

which is excellent , because os x is awesome  .

however       microsoft could of been more original within their 5 years of development  .

no doubt that vista should of been better then what it is , but it is still very good and a huge improvement over xp .

i am nicely surprised about new windows vista release (i use home premium)  .

at first i is very skeptical about it but after two days of using it i'm starting to like it more and more  .

be sure that during your windows installation , all external devices are unplugged  .

this could cause the problems with your install most of the drivers (general equipment from known manufacturers) are included in vista release so i did't need any extra upgrades except really specific equipment like thermal ups printer (old xp driver worked fine) some people say yeah it is copy of osx well maybe there is a lot of simmilarities in functionality but iven if it is i'm glad that we have this functionality  .

i always liked it in the apple but i never decided to move with mac because lack of specific software (application i use are not released for apple)  .

world is not only about email and internet and software makers are not eagor to build applications for ~4% computer market share  .

well gadgets    widgets doesn't matter as soon as customer is happy and yes i'm happy  .

vista gave me one more reason to not to think about apple gui now it is time to talk about things i don ; t like about vista user account control (uac)  .

i know that microsoft is trying to secure winsows as much as they can but this could create some problems for end user if they don't know what is going on  .

lets share some details about what i'm talking about  .

i tried to install corel software and vista gave me info that my privilages are not enough (i is on administrative account)  .

after some research i found out that administrative account is not really administrative due to uac limitations  .

so i need to this extra protection during install to allow corel to write into registry  .

i waonder why microsoft did not published any message on teh box or web that thing like that could happen during installation  .

it is not a big deal if you are familiar with computers but some users could be lets say    not happy  .

another thing i don't like is price  .

$200+ for home premium edition is kind of steep especially that i had last xp version but i wanted to do clean install  .

i think that microsoft should update their pricing scheme for the futur and offer full version for previous system owners after few days of working with vista i am really happy about thsi release  .

i did clean install and reinstalled all my apps witout major problems (except corel    stated above) and everything is working fine  .

i even use speech recognition to write this review  .

no typing and speaking about speech recognition , even if this feature takes time to learn and does not work 100% yet but it is definitely a future for any platform .

all i expect of an operating system is stability , speed , and efficient utilization of system resources  .

along with that it is reasonable to expect a secure operating environment  .

on the first two counts i am absolutely convinced that vista exceeds xp by a wide margin  .

only time will tell if vista truly is a more secure os than xp , but we certainly have a right to expect it to be  .

i wish microsoft would forget the bells and whistles they throw in as window dressing and stick to the basics , but in terms of the basics , this is by far the most stable operating system yet  .

keep in mind that mac fans have been thumbing their noses at pc users for years over stability and i do believe the playing field has been leveled with the introduction of vista  .

with that said , an upgrade to vista with a budget system is a recipe for disappointment or worse  .

if you're at the low end of the scale in terms of microsoft's benchmarks for cpu , system memory , and graphics capability , do not take the plunge  .

unless your old system just cannot hack it any more , stick with xp until you're ready to buy a new computer  .

if you have a powerful processor , plenty or ram , and a good graphics card this is a good next step with the caveat that the improvement is incremental and not revolutionary at a price that seems a bit high .

well i purchased an upgrade copy of this for my acer ferrari 4006wmli (with 2gb ram) which had xp professional x64 edition  .

i is tired of the lack of support in the 64bit os so i installed the 32bit version of vista (64bit copy is free if you purchase vista) so i could avoid all the problems and hopefully start using things like my ipod again (apple never released 64bit drivers)  .

the installation took a bit more effort than i thought it would (in part because of the 64 to 32bit change but also due to having to restructure my hard drives  .

once in stalled (a few hours later) i is very pleased with how seemless the operation went from there on  .

it appears to have been a wise update .

i don't know much about the operating system to make an accurate judgment  .

just what i've seen from technicians and the microsoft site  .

i just thought i'd let you all know to please not judge the operating system merely to the fact you don't know how to use it the mad thing is , you're all judging it and it's not even come out properly yet  .

i'm targeting those people who keep putting abysmals here  .

is there any proof that microsoft are putting additional spyware programs  .

or is that just your idea for putting microsoft off  .

also , windows pinching macs ideas ; what if it is windows customers that thought that mac had a good idea here , and decided they wanted microsoft to do the same thing  .

same goes vice    versa  .

ms comes up with a great idea and mac decides to copy it my conclusion is   please do not judge or make snide comments about the operating system until you've got a full feeling of it thanks for reading .

a quick read of many of the reviews here shows that it is impossible for a microsoft product to get a fair judgement from many  .

microsoft bashing is both fashionable and hip  .

folks that bash microsoft think they are sophisticated (especially true with journalists)  .

the same folks who gush over minor firefox upgrades bash microsoft at every turn  .

(i read one review that rated firefox superior to ie 7 because of the placement of the forwward/back buttons    does anyone really care  .

) asking for an open public rating of microsoft is a bit like asking the general public to rate george steinbrenner and the new york yankees  .

the vocal bashers will crawl out of the woodwork it's simply human nature to hate the haves  .

have a nice day everyone  .

vista is great  .

it's the best version of windows yet , and having both macs and pc , it's simply not that different from the mac os  .

this will drive the apple supporters nuts , but feature for feature , it's really not  .

yes , microsoft stole many great ideas from the mac os , and apple is planning to steal a couple from vista , but it's not like we're comparing dos to windows  .

it's one graphical os vs  .

another my feeling is that no one with vista will lovingly gaze into a mac and wish they had one , and no one with a mac would have any reason to consider vista  .

microsoft got it just close enough to close the ui gap , and arguable , vista has more features and certainly supports a much wider variety of software than the mac , for those actually bothering to look beyond the ui as to those who are not going to upgrade because xp is just what they need   vista is microsoft's future  .

people wrote the same letters when xp came out because windows 2000 is perfect and xp is this incremental and unnecessary upgrade  .

now it's the gold standard for windows well , the same letters are now reappearing regarding vista  .

yet a year , perhaps two years from now everyone will be on vista and it will be the new gold standard  .

vista is the future , there is no alternative in the windows world we might as well welcome vista and learn to love it , because it's not going away .

although it took a long time for this release to become available , i think it is worth the wait  .

not only does the os have truly innovative features and functionality in hardware , but the software is of the highest quality ms has put out to date  .

vista is a fantastic business , home and gaming platform  .

many services are disabled by default making it the most secure os from ms to date  .

i have put rtm on 5 machines so far  .

a brand new macpro , a mac book pro , a dell optiplex gx260 , and my two systems at home , athlon xp 2400+ and a athlon x2 4000+  .

all of these machines scream (well , besides the dell)  .

building of the framework of the 2003 kernel makes this an extremely solid , reliable and secure os  .

after installing it on the macpro , i wont even go back to osx except for filemaker dev , apple scripting and xcode dev (rarely)  .

vista home premium is great for the average person , but if you want to see the true power of the os , go with ultimate  .

the beauty of this os surpasses os x by leaps and bounds , ive even used the latest seed of leopard only to find that its another kernel panicking pos like the rest  .

sorry steve , my money will go to bill again but hey , stay smug  .

overall vista premium is a great product it has to be taken care of those who dont think the same are the people who dont know how to take care of it and fill it with crap it can be better than xp just needs it basic requirements  .

im using 2 vistas with 1g of ram and 1 with 3g the first with 1g dosent work as it used to because thats the one thats kinda left in the corner and not cleaned the other two work great because there taken care of  .

microsoft obviously knows just how bad and buggy this os is  .

they should really come up with an , at least functional os and let those who are stuck with vista have the upgrade for free  .

that would be only fair updated  .
