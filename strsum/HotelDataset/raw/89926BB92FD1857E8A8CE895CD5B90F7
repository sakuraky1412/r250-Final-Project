our cave room was certainly a generous size and had a good bathroom .
however , there are a couple of problems : firstly this hotel is still being built , so the noise of the jackhammers penetrates through the rock making the room noisy in the daytime ; it also causes a fine layer of dust to descend from the ceiling .
secondly , when we came to pack we found all the clothes in the wardrobe were damp ; perhaps it seeps through the rock or maybe there was a ventilation problem .
with hindsight we should have left the aircon on even though the room was plenty cool enough .
by far the biggest drawback is the lack of a pool , pretty much essential in this climate .
there are apparently plans to build one , but not for at least two years .
each day we walked down to the museum hotel to cool off in their pool .
we did n't look at their rooms or rates , but would check it out if we ever visit uchisar again .
the argos does not really have a car park though the hotel offers a valet parking service - not ideal if you need regular access to your vehicle .
when searching for the hotel , we were directed by a local the wrong way through a one-way system .
it seems the turks regard all traffic regulations as entirely optional , and we were clearly not the only vehicle taking this short cut .
if you want . . .

if you want to remain strictly legal , then follow the main road all the way around to the back of the town before turning left.
