back in the room we wanted access to the internet so we can organize the trip for the next morning and made sure someone was there to pick us up at the hotel .
my plan was to go down south to galle but as the trip to galle would take 2-3 hours i decided to wait until the morning and stay the night in colombo .
meanwhile i also asked if i could access it from the lobby area , where i was told wifi was only available in the lobby area until 11pm .
the front desk told me that wifi was free of charge for an hour in the lobby area and also in the bar on the ground floor .
we ordered a club sandwich and we had to wait about 35 minutes before it was ready .
the first thing i asked about after checking in was wifi access .
we called the front desk about 4 times before i could get someone to help me look at how i can get access from my room .
the lobby looks like it needs a bit of refurnishing but overall the rest of the hotel was up to standards .
i had neutral comments about the room itself as i do n't think there was anything good nor bad about it .
at last , i had to get a coupon code which took me about an hour and a half and about 5 phone calls to find out .
