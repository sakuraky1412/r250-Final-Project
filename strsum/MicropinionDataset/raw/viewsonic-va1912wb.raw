Summary:. am very happy with my purchase of the Viewsonic VA1912wb. I found it to be a GREAT value in that I got a great widescreen at a reasonable price. A few things to mention.. ** Buy.com shipped it in great shape...double boxing via FedEx.. ** Screen is very bright. I had to lower the brightness to near the lowest point. That is good...so there is room to the upside if I ever need that.. ** The back of the monitor is very attractive. Sounds odd...but not for those that have the back facing outwards and visible. Mine happen to be in a study that is near the front entry...so having an attractive appearance is important to us. Cables are well concealed and routed behind a beauty plate. No odd cuts or stickers/tags...clean lines.. ** Included instructions are minimal...but hey...there are only three items to hookup (power, input, speakers). There is also the web and customer support if necessary.. ** KEY ITEM...this monitor has both analog and digital inputs. Clearly digital is the direction of future hookups...so make sure to ensure whatever monitor you purchase...it has digital inputs.. ** The monitor includes the DVI cable. Many monitors do not and will cost you easily $20 more.. ** The display is clear, crisp...and better than my monitor at work. Don't notice any dead pixels...no flaws observed.. $213- $50 rebate sounds supperrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

Pros:. crisp image, widescreen, can watch movies on it. 
Cons:. wobbly, limited adjustments. 
Summary:. I got a great deal on this from CompUSA (we bought two). Both work perfectly. Like another user mentioned, the base itself isn't too flexible and the buttons are a bit cheap looking-- but for the price, you can't really ask for more. It's definitely a great buy ($199).. 

$$;
Pros:. Widescreen, sharp picture. 
Cons:. Cheap buttons, limited range stand. 
Summary:. I bought this about two months when on sale at CompUSA. I wasn't really looking for a flatscreen at the time, as my 19-inch CRT was doing ok. However, the price ($199 after rebate) was hard to pass up. The reviews generally seem to favorable.. Even though I had it shipped to my house, it arrived in perfect condition. Set up was exceptionally easy. I have my desktop plugged into the digital port and the laptop docking station plugged into the analog port and easily switch between the two with the 1/2 buttons up front. Have not experienced a single dead pixel so far and have not noticed a significant amount of light bleeding. The widescreen aspect is really great for webpages and movies. ViewSonic definitely lives up to its reputation on display quality.. The only trivial dislikes are the cheap looking buttons and the limited range stand, but for the price, I can live with those shortcomings.. 

$$;
Pros:. Value, respectable image quality, built-in speakers. 
Cons:. No height adjustment. 
Summary:. I paid $200 (after rebate) at Circuit City. This is by far the best value I've found in a 19" widescreen and to jump up to a 20" is approaching $400, so this is the value sweet spot. The high resolution (1440 x 900) on this monitor is fantastic, I bought it to extend the desktop on my new MacBook and my Dell Pavilion laptop, both of which work great. The color reproduction is not accurate enough to color correct images, but good enough for all other uses. The built-in speakers are adequate, saving you desktop space; if you're a gamer you'll probably want bigger speakers w/ sub (or headphones). Overall I'm very happy with this ViewSonic and would rate it much higher than the mediocre CNET rating.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightweight and Viewsonic brand, dvi cables included. 
Cons:. Plastic cover for the hideout cables, no height adjustments. 
Summary:. I have two of theses, my wife is an Arquitec/Drafter and she works with graphics and all those 2D application, but the real magic came when she plug the DVI cable& wow. I run to the store and buy one for myself. With a midrange video card (ATI X600pro) BF2 is running far better as was with my Envision LCD, the color and graphics are of the charts and Im very happy to use the full potential of my video card.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the amazing picture! Its just the right size.. 
Cons:. none at this point!. 
Summary:. I bought this model mainly because one of my roommates had it and have been impressed ever since it arrived. In response to the post about resolution, The 1440x900 resolution has not hindered any of the games I've played with it. You can adjust the settings if needed to adapt. The picture is crystal clear and clean. I found this on Newegg.com for $204.00 and they seem to run the special every few days.. 

$$;
Pros:. super sharp and bright picture, puts my dell 19" CRT to shame, quick one button switching from analog to digital inputs (for me from my xbox360 to the pc). 
Cons:. the back cover than conceals the digital and analog inputs is a bit tricky to get on with two card plugged in, when ordered from tigerdirect it came in its packaging box, no extra protection so beware. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent color, excellent clarity, easy-to-use controls, great driver. 
Cons:. Speakers are a little tinny, Viewsonic's quality criteria. 
Summary:. I got excited about the improved quality of an LDC monitor when I got a 17" iMac. Pictures were prettier, text was sharper... so I decided I wanted an LCD monitor for my PC. I found this monitor in a line-up at a local PC retailer and felt its quality was as good or better than the more expensive ones. After doing my homework on the web (the CNET review), I found an online retailer with a great price. Later I saw that it made CNET's list of the top 5 wide-screen LCDs. It's only about 5 times cheaper than the most expensive one... I have it side-by-side with my iMac and I feel it is much better. Maybe the 17" vs. 19" isn't a fair comparison but I feel the text is crisper and the colors are more saturated and brighter. I happened to have some PC speakers that came with a sub-woofer. I connected the Viewsonic's speakers to the sub-woofer and that helped make the tinniness go away. For the price, I can't imagine a better monitor. BTW, I bought two others for my other PC at home and one at work. One of these has a failed pixel. I wrote to tech support and was told that up to 5 failed pixels would be acceptable to them. They said they'd send me a replacement but "The replacement could have some failed pixels too." (This is a paraphrase). That's a disappointing quality policy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture sharpness, plug in and it is ready to go, widescreen. 
Cons:. Height adjustment. 
Summary:. An unbelieveable monitor for the price. Was somewhat concerned about my current system capabilites (video card) of pushing this "thing". But the difference is unbelievable when compared to my old FP (2 yrs-then pop). I made my decision from reading these reviews, so I felt the need to comment here. BE careful, of the prices you see listed here if they involve ViewSonic rebates through the retailer. If you do not buy alot of computer equipment, such as I, do not buy from Office Depot for instance, because the rebate program is so confusing you will make a mistake and end up overpaying greatly. ($75 to $100) I had thought the rebate horrors had gone by the wayside after the HP episode.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice wide screen, bright colors, lots of room for programs.. 
Cons:. Sound isn't that great, and had to buy new video card to support the high resolution. 
Summary:. Actually, this monitor works great for me. I'm a graphic designer and my wife bought it for me for Christmas. I'm actually planning on buying a second ViewSonic 1912wb. Pretty cool now that the price has dropped.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and extremely easy to use. 
Cons:. Back panel cramped no portrait mode. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear screen. 
Cons:. Really, none. Its great though a little big. 
Summary:. Use caution when buying from A Matter of Fax!. About a month ago I bought a 19 inch LCD monitor from amatteroffax.com. The monitor shipped in time and was in good condition. However trying to return it was a nightmare.. I paid $18.50 out of pocket to return it to an address in Texas that they gave me. Later it turned out I had been given the wrong address and it should have gone to New Jersey. Then it took no less than two weeks after the monitor arrived at amatterofaxs warehouse for them to process it as being returned.. Throughout this ordeal when I called to inquire about the status of my refund, the staff at amatteroffax was rude over the phone. They would transfer me around to other staff, put me on hold without warning, and showed absolutely no interest in refunding my credit card for the retuned monitor. I would often be put on hold for upwards to 30 minutes at a time. Imagine being out $220 for a monitor that you returned but never got a refund for.. Jeff, who identified himself as the director of the company was especially rude. He was demeaning on the phone, and made zero effect to locate my returned monitor at the companys warehouse, or issue a refund. He would promise to call me right back, and never call. I could tell he was avoiding my calls because he didnt want the company to have to pay the refund. This went on for weeks. After the third week I asked him how much longer it would take and he told me he didnt care. This from the director of the company. To this day, I still have not gotten my refund. I wish I had kept the monitor to sell on craigslist.. In conclusion be very careful with amatteroffax. They really do not care at all about thier customers. Use a reputable on-line dealer instead.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear bright screen, decent warranty, Digital and VGA cables included. 
Cons:. limited adjustments, Possible reliability issues long term. 
Summary:. This monitor has same native resolution as the Apple Macbook Pro 15 inch model, and it's a lot cheaper than the apple 20". The screen is bright and clear and aside from lack height adjustments I have few complaints.. I have never had a problem with any Viewsonic monitors but hesitated in purchasing this one because in the last year, 4 out of 5 viewsonic LCD panels we had at the office died after a few months. In Viewsonic's defense, they do readily replace the ones that go down.. 

$$;
Pros:. Widescreen aspect is great; sharp and vivid display; aesthetically pleasing design.. 
Cons:. None so far.. 
Summary:. I've had this monitor up and running for about an hour now, and all I can say is "WOW.....what a difference!". This is a whole different world than that of my 17-inch CRT I've been using for the past 3 years or so (which I always thought was pretty good by the way). Setup was fairly easy with no major problems. I had to restart my pc twice and actively choose to continue starting windows as normal the second time because it recognized the new monitor and wasn't sure it was compatible with Windows XP. But after that, it was a breeze. Viewsonic's software installed and automatically configured my nVidia GeForce card to be able to display the optimum recommended resolution of 1440x900. Believe me, this is the way to go. The difference from my native resolution to this one is striking! Sharp lines and vivid colors are immediately evident, and I'm only using the analog connection. After reading a few other reviews saying the display is even better using the DVI, I'm considering upgrading my graphics card and getting one with a DVI output. The auto configure mode worked great. The only thing I've changed is the brightness level. It is set to the max right out of the box and is a little much. I've reduced it way down to about 25%, and it is still very bright and crisp. Nice to know there's room to spare if you desire. Some have complained about the plastic stand. I'm not saying it couldn't be a little sturdier, but it is just fine for me, and supports the monitor well. After all, you're not going to be doing pull-ups on it or anything! As for the built-in speakers, I can't comment on them because I'm not even using them. I've got a 2.1 setup for my sound. Nice to know the option is there for those without another option though.. Don't know what else to say except that this is one sweet display for the money. We actually got 2 of these (one for me and one for my girlfriend) so they'd look better together in our office. If you've been on the fence about upgrading to a flat panel, I'd strongly recommend taking a hard look at this one. Better hurry though. I noticed the price had already gone up $5 just since we ordered ours. I found the best price at PC Nation that included FREE Fed-Ex 3-day shipping. They were great........actually got them a day earlier than promised! I'd recommend going to www.pricegrabber.com to find your own best price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent response time; no ghosting. Vivid color. 
Cons:. Takes a fair amount of adjustment depending on video card. 
Summary:. For the most part, I have been very pleased with this monitor. The response time is excellent and it was delivered with zero dead pixels. The monitor does, however, have some issues.. I use the monitor with two different PCs; one with an ATI RADEON card and the other with an nVidia GeForce card.. nVidia's software provides an easy-to-use, accurate gamma correction tool. ATI's doesn't, and it shows. The PC with the nVidia card has noticably crisper text than the one with the ATI card.. In any case, colors and images are vivid on both PCs and, for the money, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better wide-screen monitor.. I highly recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp Picture, slim design, lots of settings. Speakers integrated.. 
Cons:. Akward Connection Panel. Sound Quality could be better.. 
Summary:. This is my first LCD display. I would have to say its a night and day difference between my 17inch CRT monitor. I always have been a believer and owner in Viewsonic's products. This is one great product with a decent price. Worth every penny if you ask me!. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap, very clear and true picture reproduction, contrast ratio. 
Cons:. No wall hanging upgrade option, Fixed base. 
Summary:. Well it was time to upgrade that old Viewsonic CRT. First bought a "Princeton" 19" LCD. Returned "3 units" because of bad pixels. (I guess they figured people won't notice or somebody dropped the load ??) And then I found this nice 19" (Wide screen) at the same exact price. Never looked back. No trails on fast motion which was my concern as I use it for 3D animation. It's a keeper.... 

$$;
Pros:. price, has built-in speakers. 
Cons:. not bright or vibrant. 
Summary:. Ok for a user just looking to surf the web occasionally or send email, but not for somebody that uses the computer extensively. I would recommend you spend more money and get a better monitor.. Jason. www.jasonlevy.com. 

$$;
Pros:. Neat size and great format. 
Cons:. Muddy image. 
Summary:. I took it back because I couldn't get any life out of the image. Whatever tweaking(contrast/brightness et al.) I tried, I could not see things and shades of colour that I can see on my old Samsung LCD. It was disappointment because my previous experience with Viewsonic put them at the top and the format was perfect for my needs. 

$$;
Pros:. good monitor while it worked. 
Cons:. mine completly stopped working after 20 months. 
Summary:. Is a good monitor, when it's working, but i think ANY lcd monitor should last more than 20 months with low to medium use, (time the monitor was actually on was 1 to 3 hrs a day). I have always liked the viewsonic brand, so i was shocked when this one quit working.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price, bright. 
Cons:. Image burn. Design is clumsy.. 
Summary:. I purchased VA1912wb 5 months ago and was pleased at first. But then i noticed a light bar at top of the screen. This bleaching effect is not visible while i work as it is exactly where the window bar and menu lines are. But it becomes apparent when i'm looking at the desktop or watching dvd movies. It is as if my screen is scratched and the scratch is getting lighter and more prominent. It turns out this is what they call image burn (image persistence). I've never seen this effect until with this LCD. So you know i don't do anything extreme with it, i work during the day, turn it off during night, and have screen saver running during the day when i'm away from the desk � so the image burn problem with my ViewSonic VA1912wb is definitely due to poor screen quality. I talked to customer service and it would take them 2 weeks to fix/replace the monitor once i ship it to their repair center. So i either have to put up with this light bar and hope it doesn't get worse, or i have to buy a new monitor, ship this one at my cost, and wait 2+ weeks for this one to be repaired � i don't like either options.. BTW, just recently over thanksgiving the monitor was off for 5 days. When i came back things did get a little better but the image burn promptly came back within a day or two of use. My recommendation is stay away from this model. ViewSonic is probably skimping on quality to bring the price down..
