Pros:. -Ultra crisp and clear high resolution display. -4 USB 2.0 ports. -Longevity (everything works perfectly after 9 years). -Can swivel in many directions. -Neck can be extended vertically. 
Cons:. -On-screen menu. 
Summary:. I bought this in fall of 2001 and I still use it! That's exactly NINE YEARS!!! Not only does it work, but EVERYTHING still works like new!!! I can't believe how good the technology was back then. It rivals current technology believe it or not. The VGA input works perfectly and I never used the DVI input until just a few weeks ago (9 years after purchase) and it works great! This monitor wasn't even made to use HDMI since it wasn't even invented at the time, but with an HDMI to DVI adapter, you can use this just like you would use your brand new LCD HD TV!!! I'm not even trying to sell the thing because it works so great. Why fix something that isn't broke? This monitor receives heavy usage, including all 4 perfectly working USB 2.0 ports. Talk about a great investment! I could sell this today and it would work the way it worked 9 years ago!. 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous, huge, reliable. 
Cons:. Haven't found any after a year. 
Summary:. I've had this monitor for over a year, and I still love it. When I'm using another computer, I can't wait to come back to mine. =) Great color rendering - it works wonderfully with my color-calibrated setup.. 

$$;
Pros:. Absolutely beautiful in text, graphics, games and in DVD/Movies. Having used many monitors ove the years, this is the CRT replacement I've been waiting for!. 
Cons:. The pivot doesn't work as well as I thought it would. A bit pricey but worth it!. 

$$;
Pros:. The 2001FP is an absolutely stunning display! No ghosting, incredibly sharp picture, no washed-out colors or wacky saturation problems like cheaper displays. I use the DVI connector for my PC and have the analog connected to my server. Dell always has. 
Cons:. Monitor still a little tall with the stand fully collapsed. May be a problem if you have a shelf over your monitor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp, bright,and the best part..I can play CoH at 1600x1200 with no ghosting whatsoever. Amazing LCD!!!. 
Cons:. Dell's listing says "usually ships in 24 hours" but is actually 1 week. no complain... 

$$;
Pros:. Looks good even without DVI at 1024x768. I used to have a 19" CRT, and now, I have my desk back!. 
Cons:. Bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. Check out www.techbargains.com for price breaks and coupons to ease the pain.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought it because my 15" just wasn't large enough to play Unreal 2 on.. 
Cons:. None that I've encountered so far.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing image quality, small pixels. Personally, I prefer the 4:3 size over over the (more hip?) 16:9 format and use two monitors of better quality (one for working and one for parking data/apps). This one has a native resolution of 1600x1200. 
Cons:. Not on mine, but seen some where the FLT are starting to go bad (dark monitor). I guess these workhorses start to show their age.. 

$$;
Pros:. Creamy smooth image, very clean whites, no color cast. 
Cons:. Ghosting in games/movies, better for design work. 
Summary:. I've been using this monitor for over a year for Adobe apps (and YouTube) and it's still beating out all the new DELLs coming into the office in the last year. Had a 2005FP for a while and now it's sitting right next to a 2007FP, and the 2001FP is still the Photoshop champion. The picture quality is gorgeous. There is no light falloff in the corners or at the edge, and white looks like white.. By comparison the 2007FP next to me is a greener shade of "white" and has a noticeable pixel "screen door" effect. Colors are harsh by comparison. I'm noticing tiny text in an AIM window is actually difficult to read, but not so when I move the window to this monitor.. I can compare this 2001FP to a Cinema Display and easily get lost in debating the fine details, but the 2007FP isn't even in the same league. Get a 2001FP for less if you can find it in stock!. 

$$;
Pros:. huge screen 1600x1200 resolution,very usefull silver stand.picture in picture. 
Cons:. $$$$$$$$$ u understand $$$$$$. 
Summary:. i find this product a superhero on ur desk because of it size and work...don't believe what they say about the bad things of this LCD they are just some people from other companies.... i have i try it it's woooooooow. but as i saied about the coast so i live in lebanon (middle east)and here we have a lot of taxes so 1000$ are ....no comments..... but the service is very good and i'm so convainced.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, brightness, contrast, sharpness, inputs. 
Cons:. Not the blackest of blacks. 
Summary:. Brilliant. If you're a videophile then perhaps you'll be put off by the fact blacks aren't amazingly... black. But otherwise, in general use and in most games, videos and even in productivity use - this monitor is brilliant.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, Contrast is increadable, games are perfect.. 
Cons:. Monitor is not a 4:3 size, but uses a 4:3 pixel settings, so images are a bit stretched.. 
Summary:. This is the best monitor I've ever used. Except for one problem. It's dimensions are not exactly 4 by 3, even though it is a 1600x1200 pixel display which should require a 4 by 3 panel. It's about 10% wider than 4:3, making the images stretch just a touch.. After a bit of research though, it seems no company makes a 20" or 21" LCD that is perfectly 4:3, and under $1000. For some reason these size monitors are used mostly for portrait instead of landscape viewing. But I still can't figure out why they are using the 4:3 pixels.. Other than that oddity, this monitor is the best you can get for the money. Wait for Dell to put it on sale, which it does at least once a month, and you'll be in heaven.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, 16ms,size,colors. 
Cons:. None yet then I can think of..... 
Summary:. What a beautiful monitor. It is replacing my older P991 19" Trintron CRT that is fading. (A great monitor in it's own right). I have found nothing wrong with this new screen. No dead pixels, Colors are perfect, NO Blur effect. I am using a X800XL 256meg X16 Video Card. This I know makes a difference. The 16ms response time is at the highest I want it to be. 12ms would be better.. If you watch the Dell site and pay attention you can get this one at a good price. It is listed at $759.00 I paid $539.00 on sale.. My only regret is that I can not afford the 2405FPW 24" Dell monitor. Even on sale it is too expensive for me. That monitor is the ultimate. My friend owns that one and it is Jaw Dropping Beautiful. This monitor is just behind it and just as beautiful in pic quality just not widescreen.. Highly Recommended!!. 

$$;
Pros:. 20inch, great responce time, price. 
Cons:. wish the USB ports were placed somewhere better. 
Summary:. I have had mine for about 2 months and am very impressed!!! Originally I was looking @ the apple display but the price difference ouch! Very pleased. Would another one. I would like to have dual inputs but that is not a must have for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. crisp text, option of portrait positioning for business use, loads of viewable space at it's resident 1600 x 1200 setting, substantial base, 4 usb ports in the monitor, outstanding value for the price. 
Cons:. lame cord management loop in the back, front control buttons poorly marked. 
Summary:. I waited a long time to get an LCD monitor and was apprehensive since I always thought CRTs were far superior. Also heard about a "screen door effect" this monitor supposedly produces. The minute I turned it on I was blown away by the clarity, crisp images and type and brightness. After much research I believe for the price it's the best monitor you can buy, especially if you wait for a promotion at Dell.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great all around. High resolution, sharp picture, fine colors, DVI/Analog/S-video inputs and USB 2.0 hub too. Watch for discounts on Dell site.. 
Cons:. First one had multiple "stuck on" pixels but only noticeable on black screen. Dell overnighted a replacement.. 

$$;
Pros:. I'm not a computer geek and my skin is not pasty white from living inside. I have been using and buying computers since the first IBM PC. Of all the monitors that I have bought this is the very best. Large screen, easy to set up and use. Good graphics a. 
Cons:. Perhaps the cost is a tad more than I wanted to pay. But AS compared to the Samsung 213T it was a no brainer.. 

$$;
Pros:. An excellent monitor for this cost. I bought this for a mix of coding/typing/and playing first-person-shooters. I can definitely say I was not disappointed. I can see no visible ghosting during games and interpolation retains decent quality until about a. 
Cons:. There is a slight screen-door effect if you look closely (where you can see a criss-cross of the rows and columns of pixels, similar to looking out of a screen-door). However, I find that this is only noticeable if youre specifically looking for it and. 

$$;
Pros:. 1600X1200 resolution, very much needed by me. bright,very good colors,very sharp.. 
Cons:. expensive, but sometimes on sale.. 

$$;
Pros:. 16ms response time - no ghosting in games. 1600 x 1200 gives you alot of destop workspace. Nice picture. You can't touch anything this nice without spending $200 to $1,000 more.. 
Cons:. The negitives I read here are from perfectionists or just hard to please people.. 

$$;
Pros:. TOO MANY TO MENTION---ESP LIKE THE 1600X1200.. 
Cons:. ONLY CON I CAN FIND IS HAVING TO TALK TO INDIA FOR SUPPORT. JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEM.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp, 1600x1200 image. No bad pixels. CNET reviewer doesn't understand DVI -- contrast is always "perfect" with DVI so no need for contrast adjustment. Just bought on sale for $750 ppd, can't beat the sale's price! This is first LCD monitor I've used tha. 
Cons:. Right edges slightly brighter black than other parts of display. I had to buy a new video card to support DVI at 1600x1200. This monitor basically requires DVI for best performance. High 90w power consumption, however that appears to include optional spea. 

$$;
Pros:. This is a great monitor, I bought 2. Watch techbargains for temporary price reductions, I got mine for 750 each which made it an outstanding deal. Brightness is extremely good to me, and I really like the Pivot ability of the stand. I'm a hardcore FPS. 
Cons:. Monitor doesn't ship with the software to use it in pivot mode.. 

$$;
Pros:. sharp display, especially with DVI, plenty of inputs, looks great on my desk!. 
Cons:. could be a little brighter, but other than that, nothing bad that i've noticed. 

$$;
Pros:. clarity, detail beyond any crt. gaming is top notch, seen as they were designed.. 
Cons:. none. 

$$;
Pros:. Good response time, Several video inputs, quality manufacturing. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. I bought this monitor from Dell when they had it on sale for far less than it normally goes for. I have zero complaints thus far. When the monitor arrived, there were no dead pixels and after about 6 months it is still in top shape.. I've also played a decent number of FPS games using this monitor and it looks great! There are monitors out there with faster response times, but I haven't noticed any ghosting or decrease in quality of gameplay at all.. Also, I love the Picture-in-picture feature. I do a decent amount of work from home, and it is nice to be able to pipe my TV-signal into the monitor in a small window in the corner, while I still have most of the screen real estate available to me. There is a nice set of controls for changing the size and location of the PIP window as well.. Overall, this monitor has been a great investment over the big, old, hot CRT that used to sit on my desk.. 

$$;
Pros:. The size of the panel is awesome, the quality is incredible and it's Dell. 
Cons:. The USB cable that comes with it is kind of short, considering the pc is under the desk and such a 10' cable would have been better.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looking at most of the negative reviews I get the impression that many of these people are not using the monitor at its native 1600x1200 resolution. Both the NEC 1880SX and 1960NX have a poor native res of 1,280 x 1,024. Any LCD in wrong res will look p. 
Cons:. Price! All LCDs are still too high. Heat from top of monitor  compared to Dells 17 LCDs this model seems to get a lot warmer along the top of the frame.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great gaming LCD. This was THE monitor used by most ALL game and tech companies during E3 2004. nVidia, ATI and most all PC game companies used these exact monitors to showcase their stuff. The only reason I bought mine!. 
Cons:. Support. For those with trouble with Dell support, go here for a video that will help: http://www.illwillpress.com/t ech.html (content is MY fault, CNET is not responsible for content outside of it's own site) ;). 

$$;
Pros:. Large viewable area, Screen Rotates, Multiple Inputs, USB 2.0Hub. 
Cons:. Stand is a little bulky. 

$$;
Pros:. Product arrived as ordered. Great pricture quality with Half Life 2. Paid $ 599 on Dell's webpage. ALL necessary cables included.. 
Cons:. Manual only on CD.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture quality is fantastic! I replaced it with my 21" Mag Monitor which was starting to bad. I connected this monitor to the DVI connector and the picture quality is great. I can't ask for more. 
Cons:. None. 

$$;
Pros:. This monitor rocks. The price is right and 1,600x1,2000 is great. Sharper than my CRT.. 
Cons:. None. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought two of these. No dead pixels on either display. I wasn't able to compare them side by side with other brands, but I have no complaints. I drive both monitors from an nVidia 5200 based card, and they work great.. 
Cons:. The only downside is that some people don't like 1600x1200 at this size. You will be able to get a lot on the screen, but text can be a bit small. Also, you need a very beefy graphics card to run 3D games at that resolution. Desktop apps look very bad. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought one for $750 including shipping, a phenominal deal. Had to buy a new video card to run 1600x1200 DVI. No dead pixels. I find the built-in USB hub very convenient. No operating problems.. 
Cons:. Dell's product support isn't geared for non-system purchases. However note that if you buy this or any monitor with a system you get the system warranty for the monitor, which could be as little as a single year.. 

$$;
Pros:. Four inputs: DVI, Analog 15-pin, S-Video, Composite, and easy to switch between them. Has 16ms response time which you cannot find a monitor under $1000 at 19" let alone 20" with 16ms and the features of this one. Note that 16ms = 60 Hz or 60 FPS. Auto ad. 
Cons:. Heavy base, weighs about as much as the monitor, but allows for rotation of monitor. Seems to take a little bit for screen to "warm up" completely for full brightness. Not the greatest location for connecting cables, difficult to turn screws on connectors. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality is great when Observing DVD Movies. Since this is my first Lcd monitor I'm still getting use to the kind of quality it provides. For some reason I have always beleived that Ctr monitor give you a solid quality to the Image. I must have bioni. 
Cons:. The factory settings suck.I spent nearly an hour getting the sittings to the proper adjustments in which I was used too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good image quality. Great adjustability. Extra features like USB ports are nice. 
Cons:. 1600x1200 native resolution is too small to work on a spreadsheet with. Even at 16ms response time i detected some ghosting while playing half life 2 and older half life mods. I would not say this monitor is suitable for gaming, which is why i bought it. 

$$;
Pros:. good image quality, relatively cheap, usb hub, you can get this monitor for 650 with the right coupons on dell.com. 
Cons:. none really, i think there are some employees of other cmopanies posting negative reviews here. 

$$;
Pros:. An excellent, clear monitor with 1600x1200 resolution. I've been very, very satisfied with it, especially when connected via DVI.. 
Cons:. Too expensive at retail, but it's possible to grab it for $750 (new) or less (refurbished) when on sale, which occurs roughly monthly. slickdeals.net usually catches these.. 

$$;
Pros:. A great lcd with high res, dig/analog/s-video/comp inputs and 4 USB ports. I have to keep the brightness down below 40%. I can actually read two full pages side by side in Word. Good response on games, too.. 
Cons:. Had to ship the first on back because of hundreds of stuck on pixels. Support was fine once you get past the "quick support code" on Dell web site.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very large screen, shaper images, flat panel great!. 
Cons:. Tough to tranport. Space will ve at a premium.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great feature - SVideo, Composite, USB hub, etc... Great Viewing Angle, Good for gaming!. 
Cons:. This goes for all 20" displays that it's just too many pixels (1600*1200) for a display this size... 1600*1200 is perfect for a 21.3" display!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great, however does anyone know who to get it to pivot. I downloaded the updated driver but that doesn't help. Is there another software I have to get?. 
Cons:. Pivot problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price at this size. Digital and analog ins. 1600x1200 USB2 HUB and wall mountable. Wait for a sale at dell!. 
Cons:. None at this price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good resolution, quick response speed for an LCD 3 Year warranty!. 
Cons:. Sleep mode doesn't always work, maybe it's my computer settings.. 

$$;
Pros:. Much easier to read for onlin classes,surf and game on than my previous Dell m991 crt.. 
Cons:. None so far. excpt not being able to use the osd to change some features.. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is big (obviously). I bought two of them and work has become a pleasure. Im seeing double but in this case its a good thing!. 
Cons:. The screen is not "hightech" enough for games that I play during my break. Make sure you have a quality video card. My old Dell 8200 just could not cut it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice features and usually on sale at Dell. It games well. I was able to compare it side by side to a Planar 2010M and the Planar is of obvious higher build quality (no dead pixels, had to send the first Dell back for pixels and distorted color) and just a. 
Cons:. Dell sales. Hard to understand reps and difficult to deal with. I canceled original order and 4 days later it showed up anyway and defective at that. Heat. Seems to put out more heat than I would expect and more than the Planar. Quality. The first one ha. 

$$;
Pros:. $749 price on sale can't be beat! Vibrant display. No dead pixels.. 
Cons:. None yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has a much nicer bezel than the 2000FP, faster response time, and more built in features like a pivot and also the USB hub.. 
Cons:. This display exhibits a worse screen door effect than my previous 2000FP. I have no idea why, they have the same # of pixels so it makes no sense. But in that sense the IQ is a step backwards. My display also has two dead pixels, one more than my 2000F. 

$$;
Pros:. HUGE HUGE HUGE Easily adjustable height Price is good for the size 1600x1200 (very few lcd's can pull this off). 
Cons:. Dell support is known for there non-existence You might have to cut back on costs in other places to afford it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Resolution, Price. 
Cons:. Unable to config contrast settings when connecting via DVI.. 

$$;
Pros:. one has to wonder why CNET is listing the resolution for every monitor listed but not this one, which just happens to have the highest at 1600x1200. That's where the extra money goes and the importance of that resolution on a 20" panel can't be understate. 
Cons:. not the fastest screen on the market but hey, compare the price and it's not a bad deal. 

$$;
Pros:. there are better deals out there. 
Cons:. No monitor for the computer is worth more than 3 or 4 hundred dollars what a waste of money.crt's are faster and more dependable in the long and short of things.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast refresh Bright display Great colors. 
Cons:. Horizontal lines across the display. Seems like every other line of pixles is brighter. Not terribly noticeable on darker colors and in games. But it was enough to bug the hell out of me enough to return it. Too bright - causes eye strain. 

$$;
Pros:. Not much. 
Cons:. Very poor text resolution at 1600x1200. I just returned it today. 

$$;
Pros:. Thin bezel,mechanically/ergonomica lly slick,no stuck pixels,bright,big.. 
Cons:. Screen pivots,and the text with it. I bought it SOLELY for the portrait mode, and it has been a headache trying to find a driver that works. Thin documentation. Is it supposed to pivot on-the-fly? Do you click on some hidden icon to invoke the pivot? Trie. 

$$;
Pros:. Resolution of course - 1600x1200 has been the minimum for decent work for years and no LCD is going to see my buck for less then that. So, we could say that this is the first non-toy LCD from Dell's stable. Oh, and for the curioyus mind, I went to take a. 
Cons:. For this resolution, the physical size of the monitor can be way smaller. If that means DVI-only connection - no problems, this is the all day use class of the monitor so upgrading a video card is a non-issue for anyone entering this range. IBM had 1600x1. 

$$;
Pros:. High resolution. 
Cons:. Terrible anti-glare coating decreases image quality. 
Summary:. This monitor has a high resolution, but its anti-glare coating may become a very big problem, because coating is clearly visible if your eyes are picky. Coating looks as if the screen is dirty. If you search on the Internet, you may find many other reviews describing this problem. Coating is less visible on dark colors, but causes dirty look especially on white colors. I do coding and my eyes end up focusing on the coating of the screen instead of the code that I write. I see it even from 4 meters away from the monitor. Coating also causes blurriness, so you may end up missing the details of images, so this monitor is also not very suitable for photo editing. I tried to get used to the coating, but I couldn't. If your eyes are not sensitive, you may not have such problems. In this case, this monitor can be a good choice for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Packed with features, great colors.. 
Cons:. The monitor has a notorious screendoor effect. Horizontal lines dont have the same brightness even if they are displaying the same color. Very obvious with midtone colors.. not visible with 100%black or 100%white. This is really non acceptable for a monit. 

$$;
Pros:. Good looking, good price. 
Cons:. Cannot update Nvidia or ATI drivers or DVI goes into "power saving mode." Have to use analog hook-up.. 

$$;
Pros:. size, inputs, and outputs. 
Cons:. Worst customer support I have ever dealt with. Can not talk to anyone who speaks english, live in the US. Having problems with the image quality on most settings.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks Good If You Don't Turn It On. 
Cons:. Terrible Image, Dell Bait &#38; Switch, Dishonest Service. 
Summary:. This monitor is well regarded, after much research, I bought it despite misgivings about Dell's poor customer service, but it seemed like a great deal, $440, free shipping. Huge mistake.. The monitor had severe light leaks all around the screen, really bad in the corners and left side. You couldn't miss this defect if you were blind.. Dell told me I could exchange it, but only for a refurbished unit. Pay for new monitor, get a refurbished monitor. What's up with that?. Stay away from Dell, no matter how good the deal is. PLEASE check resellerratings.com to see the way Dell does business before you buy anything from them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price for a 20" flat panel display, but substandard picture quality took away that value. 
Cons:. I already own the NEC 1880SX Flat Panel Monitor, for 1 1/2 years now. It is the best flat panel monitor I have seen-- Brightest Whites, Incredible Clarity &#38; Definition, beautiful slim bezel (only 1/2"). So when I bought my wife a new Dell computer, si.
