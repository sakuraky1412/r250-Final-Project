needed a slim and smooth working network drive  .

it satisfies these requirements and is operable on all os (i have used it on win , linux and mac) .

for my new xbox i wanted a spacious storage for all my music and videos  .

sound mixing and editing work files are also there which required them all to be in one place for quick reference  .

i picked up 34337 only to serve this purpose  .

moreover it doesn  .

t get warm soon , which is a rare plus seen in most of the ext hard drives i have used yet .

i is looking for a supercompatible , easy    to    go , large    memory media networkdrive and i thought i'll have to wait for a long time to find one that fits my bill  .

now i know it is a good decision and i could see that however often i may use it it has been mor than a year since purchased and till date it has been stupendous .

setting up my iomega home media on my windows xp happened instantaneously  .

i did not have any confusion ; just followed the instruction on the documentation and the set up is done  .

extremely happy that i can share files on different operating systems in my home network  .

connected my home media to my wireless router and it is nice that my printer has also gone wireless  .

is wondering about the speeds on a wireless setup but i am happy with the performance and there is very little difference between a wired and wireless setup  .

since this hard drive works as itunes server we play our favorite videos on it directly  .

i also noted that this device does not need any software and i am not using any of the software that came with it  .

it allows me remote access of my files secure  .

it is best to opt for firmware updates as soon as you have your device installed as it improves the functionality which may not be available otherwise  .

the exhaust fan in the device is the main culprit for making that noise but this is very essential as it lets the nas cool down .

this network attached storage device is one which makes for easy setup , functioning and secure network protection  .

have 3 comps , all are windows 7 , software pretty much takes care of everything else  .

printing generally gets a bit slow , despite the access on a network , but am surprised this server doesn  .

t show up a slowdown of printer access on network  .

certainly a cool server .

this drive solved my media storage needs for home    based business and entertainment media all in one go  .

i haven't used the print server , but that's a nice plus on the unit  .

it's easy to set up and once it's running and you have your files loaded you can access it from any pc (even my little netbook , which is a nice way to watch archived tv shows in widescreen)  .

i haven't tried connecting to it with the xbox 360 but my ps3 detected it automatically and gives me access to all my tv shows in high def through its hdmi connection so i do not have to watch everything on my pc monitor i love this drive and have recommended it to my friends .

i bougth this on a sunday that same day in less then 10 min i is running everything lots of space , runs cool , have to say i recomend this to anyone who wants to put in a small inexpensive extenal networkable drive this is it mac and pc i have run maxtor products and western digital this is better .

i've read a lot of the other complaints about this drive , and i guess i've been lucky ; it's worked as advertised out of the box since i got it a little less than a year ago  .

recently upgraded the firmware , then plugged an ntfs    formatted 750gb usb drive into it's usb port and it works great  .

i have both pcs (xp  .

vista , win7) and a macbook pro (os x 10  .

6) , and all can see the drive  .

had some spotty problems with the home storage manager on the mac , but i just use the mac finder    no problems there  .

don't use the included backup software  .

have not tried the new time machine support yet .

when visiting my sister over christmas , i found they had no backup for 4 years of photos so we went buying this nas    device    mainly for price reasons it took only 30 minutes to get everything working    .

1 pc on xp , 1 laptop on vista , wlan via fritzbox and a philips lcd tv  .

after installing the software and connecting the iomega tothe wlan    router (fritzbox) , you could see immediately the pre    configured directories and the software suggested to syncronize the homedirectory with the nas box we changed that slightly to syncronize only the pictures with the picture folder  .

with a little clicking arround we found the dlna seting in the web    administration interface and activated it it the directly interworked with the philips tv (also via wlan)    cool    but do not expect a snappy performanc when browsing the pictures , the pictures are transferred in 10megapixel to the tv via wlan andthen need to be scaled down by th tv  .

that takes about 3    5 seconds and is ok in slide    show    mode now the setup is , that pictures and music is synced to the picture and music folder and the pcs are incrementally backed up once a week to the backup folder conclusion   just what is needed as a second palce to store pictures and music .

out of the box this drive worked well with os x 10  .

after updating firmware problems began took me a solid night to    .

update firmware and home storage manager (different versions for both os x 10  .

4 and 10  .

6 machines)  .

find out that the newly created folders on my macintosh hd (server movies , server pictures , etc) were non    functional and local anyway  .

find out that in 10  .

6 instead i had to actively check a box in the sidebar preferences (alt click on left side of finder window) to mount servers on my desktop to make the network drive folders appear  .

find out that a space in the name of the drive caused this to be invisible for both macs  .

after all of this    one night further    everything worked well and even time machine is running  .

got this product from fry's store thru my brother  .

excellent packaging  .

user manual and other basic setup information available in the package  .

the power adapter is compatible for 100~240v range  .

cat 5e lan cable included that connects from nas port to the lan port  .

formatting this 1tb drive is very simple  .

just follow the links in the system menu of the user interface that the device incorporates  .

be warned the entire drive may be formatted in a single click  .

so only format the drive for the first time  .

no partitioning support (atleast i did not find anything from the user interface to partition the drive) data is stored in folders  .

some default folders available like music , photos , backups , etc , but you can also create folders of your choice  .

also in the interface you create/add users and store the username and password information in the nas  .

user based access can be given to folders , there is no folder write protection  .

once you gain entry to the nas you can read/write/overwrite the contents of the accessible folders will not be using the bundled retrospect hd , so no comments on the automatic/scheduled backup capabilites   for good data transfer rates over your network bundle this buy with an 10/100/1000 mbps switch (gigabit switch) or home routers that support full duplex 10/100/1000 mbps ports  .

in conclusion home media network drive    good buy , if drive capacity is considered , but definately needs improvement on features and settings that will improve the drives functioning .

i like this unit  .

it allows me to stream music , video and pictures to my xbox360 without turning on a pc i am disappointed in the fact that the packaging and specs say it supports ntfs usb hard drives but it does not  .

i am also disappointed in the fact that iomega says it supports wma but it only supports compressed wma not lossless  .

still , i will keep mine until i can justify something more expensive .

for an ordinary dhcp home network , it is a great nas , but for businesses schools and such you need to go for a more expensive drive with a mac address  .

it baffles me that they would not give the drive designed to connect to a network an address , even my nintendo has one .

connecting this drive to a imac (intel) has been a long yet fruitful experience , fruitful because it seems now to be working with timemachine for the moment at least  .

out the box the imac did not recognize the drive  .

i tried everything to achieve this , connected via ethernet to the router , ethernet to imac directly , usb connection to imac but nothing worked  .

the software that comes in the box did not even recognize the drive  .

only way to connect is using command prompt , something i'm not an expert in but it still did not appear mounted  .

besides this is supposedly plug play , not so for mac os x  .

i contacted the iomega support , although very helpful they could not help me  .

then i found this blog ; http  //roncox  .

org/12 , followed the instructions and voila  .

now not only does timemachine work but the iomega 'home storage manager' also finds the drive  .

pure joy but it took way too long and it really should not be neccessary to use command prompts to get a drive working  .

iomega should review their statement about os x compatibility we'll see if it behaves and keeps working .

i liked it due to price and stated performance  .

unfortunately , i just have an expensive printer switch now because my 5    year    old 80gb usb external drive transfers backups faster  .

i realize i am hardly a normal user , but i really would like to use it as a backup device not just a printer switch  .

i guess you get what you pay for  .

this nas seems to work well , the printer switch works great , the software looks hokey but functional , i got chat support for the software since the software in the box didn't support win7 (chat is very nice once i came to the top of the queue)  .

i would not recommend this unit to any of my friends , though  .

with the best transfer rate achieved being 13mb/sec over gigabit connecting to my system with teamed gb nics and raid    1 drives inside and a 6ft cat6 cable is well just plain pathetic  .

transferring to another computer on my network (without the raid and with a 50ft cat5e cable) , i get around 65mb/sec sustained so i know it is not my network or my computer causing the bottleneck .

shame on me (been fooled twice)  .

iomega cobbles together potentially excellent hardware , then ruins it with an alien interface  .

example   iomega rev drive is the only reasonably priced removable media hard drive for backup  .

yet , it shows up as a cdrom  .

so much standard software wo not work with it they've done it again  .

this thing could be so useful if it were just a network hard drive especially if you could connect an ntfs external drive to the usb port  .

instead they put a typical goofy iomega interface that limits its application to supported operating systems  .

it never occured to me that a vista    compatible device would not work with w7  .

what's with you people at iomega  .

mine's going back to dell on monday  .

thanks for nothing , iomega  .

this is the last time i even consider a product with your name on the box  .

i chose this model because it came with a backup software and this is the first use of this nas , to backup my home computers (4 laptops and 2 desktops) daily and automatically  .

but this feature does not work  .

there's a bug in the emc retrospec hd2  .

5 software that is known by emc since but no fix available emc retrospec express hd is just a teaser so buy something else if like me you need a nas to perform automatic home network backup .

it is more for entertainment than for any nas function  .

no nfs .

this is the second nas drive i have purchased from iomega and both are gathering dust  .

fool me twice shame on me .

the system is not smart  .

when it stop in the middle of the backup or any process , it locks up the drive  .

you cannot go back to the earlier version of the firmware  .

be ready to loss your data .

great price with nice features , but horrid customer service and an unreliable product  .

not worth it , go for a lacie nas .

no good  .

buy something else updated  .

on jul 31 , 2010  .

lot and lots of problems getting this nas to connect in my house  .

i haven't even tapped into the extensive feature list , but when i went up to iomega's support site i saw all the other frustrated users  .

don't try to call phone support , they do not offer it  .

really too bad  .

i bought this over a month ago and have been trying to get it to work , now my return policy is up .

backup software does not seem to work , the products break down and support from the company is non    existant  .

this item broke down within two months of purchase  .

all my backups are lost  .

my experience has been horible  .

don't waste your money the advertised features do not work and the customer support is poor  .

for no apparent reason i cant access any of the shared folders on the drive even though the computer can see them  .

(visit the user forum and see how many people have this problem  .

imagine tech support suggested that i try formatting the drive    to lose all my data  .

obviously clueless the print server feature never worked neither did the backup software that came with it now i have apparently lost my data  .

do your own research into problems with this product before you even consider using it youve been warned  .

i have no experience with this device , because it does not work  .
