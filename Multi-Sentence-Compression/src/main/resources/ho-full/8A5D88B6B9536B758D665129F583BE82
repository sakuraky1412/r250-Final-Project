decided on this park as it was close to everything in the area and already many great reviews .
we stayed in a ensuite cabin while our friends stayed just behind us in a powered site .
our cabin had all we needed as was well presented and clean .
queen size bed in one room and bunks in the other .
all the typical things fridge , microwave , stove , dishwashing liquid tea towel etc and enough utensils for 6 although we were only two .
the bathroom had shower , toilet and wash basin with complementary shower gel , shampoo etc also there was a hairdryer that i did n't see on the website .
the swimming pool is large enough for everyone on site and was well used while we were there .
the bbq area outside our unit were great to eat out for dinner and hot breakfast and you also got to chat with others on site no need to cook inside the cabin .
i did manage to have a look at the shower block just near the swimming pool too they looked like they had been modernised and were great for people who were just camping like my friends .
their site had rubber matting to park the caravan on which i though was a nice touch in case it rained and the area was muddy around them .
would i recommend this caravan park to others .
yes i would most certainly would with the club only 5 . . .
