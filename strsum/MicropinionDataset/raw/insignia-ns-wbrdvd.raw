Pros:. Streaming feature has added great entertainment for the family! Easy to use. My 7 yr old is able to easily connect to netflix for the streaming. Picture quality is great...on regular DVDs. (Haven't tried a blu ray movie yet).. 
Cons:. A little loud during dvd load, but a still a quick load.. 
Summary:. Replaced an upconvert DVD player after it broke down. Bought primarily for the streaming, but overall it is a great unit. As this is my first Insignia product, I am impressed!. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in WiFi, Netflix streaming.. 
Cons:. No cons yet. 
Summary:. DO WANT! FOR FREE!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture with all types of DVD,s; Wi-Fi connects fast and easy. Auto downloads software upgrades; NETFLIX streams perfectly; relatively fast load. Supports multible video formats from flash-drive or data cd..

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality great and it does not freeze like samsung models. 
Cons:. Which it had pc streaming. 
Summary:. Great player for price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Does everything it's advertised to do seamlessly for half the price of similarly priced products with the same feature set. Netflix streaming quality is even better than I can get on my PC.. 
Cons:. Have to switch to PCM audio output when streaming Netflix.. No way to stream your network music. 
Summary:. I purchased this with the purpose of moving my Media Center PC to my office to replace an old computer there. Once I realized that I couldn't stream my network music, I began to wonder whether this was a good purchase. After seeing how seamlessly everthing else worked, and I found out I was able to play music files from a USB drive, It looks much better and doesn't have the quirks that my media center has when playing Blu-Rays or DVD's. Netflix streaming is at a much higher quality than my Media Center. FYI, the media center is Windows 7 Quad Core machine with 6GB RAM and is clean of spyware and viruses. I just can't take this back at this point even though I use the ability to play all of the music files from one directory using Winamp's great visualizations.. 

$$;
Pros:. You can hook it up wireless or with a cable.. 
Cons:. none so far.. 
Summary:. Some folks have trouble connecting wireless. A good signal form your router is one of the main things to check. A good strong signal should take some of the headaches out of your life.. 

$$;
Pros:. Internal Wi-fi. Great picture and great sound. Streams Netflix. 
Cons:. Confusing to set-up wi-fi and remote is very cheap. 
Summary:. If you can find this on sale...get it. Even if you end up paying the original price, your are getting a lot of features and a very very nice picture.. 

$$;
Pros:. Like this unit because of the Netflix capability and WIFI. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. Just bought one for hubby hope he likes it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the Wi-fi and BD Live features.. 
Cons:. Not sure many people will have faith in the Insigna brand for a good blu-ray player. However, they have proven themselves worthy in this category. Maybe this will turn the tables on perception.. 
Summary:. Great features for the price. I think everyone should try one. I hope I will get one soon!. 

$$;
Pros:. Decent price, good features, espcially wi-fi and Netflix connectivity.. 
Cons:. 1. The remote is weak. I have to point it right at the player, vs my old Sony remote which I could point anywhere. 2. It's very noisy and slow loading up a disk. Weird, scratchy, mechanical sounds. But, once loaded, it's OK.. 
Summary:. I dont know who makes this for Best Buy, but disregarding the slow and noisy loading, and weak remote, all in all it's OK. The best part is it's one of the lower priced players with wi-fi built in.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is great, even better than a samsung unit i own. 
Cons:. remote is finicky. 
Summary:. Great player, i bought this on sale for 129.00, i have been loving it ever since, the picture quality is better than a samsung blu ray player that i own. makes me wonder what i was watching before cause this is awesome picture, netflix works great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Connected easily to my wireless network. Good quality overall - Netflix a little shaky at times.. 
Cons:. I have a ps3 and the Netflix interface is better on their machine.. 
Summary:. Overall a solid product from Insignia with Netflix capabilities.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality, wifi connectivity, Netflix streaming and affordable.. 
Cons:. The remote is big, and the buttons on my unit stick. Setup was a little time consuming.. 
Summary:. So far, it's a solid unit that didn't break the bank. Love the Netflix streaming.. 

$$;
Pros:. built in wifi. 
Cons:. little name-brand recognition (Best Buy brand). 
Summary:. I am looking into buying a Blue-Ray player, specifically one with built-in wifi and Netflix readiness. I am between the LG, Sony N460 (which would require an external ethernet bridge, since wifi isn't built in) and this one. However, the price difference makes me wonder if I can trust the quality of this one. Does anyone have the Insignia NS-WBRDVD, and if so, could you comment on the level of user-friendliness of its interface for Netflix and other online video streaming? Thank you.. Also, I would like to be submitted for the contest to win one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Liked that the Netflix worked well, but the fact that I can add a USB flash drive to the back and watch movies I have is also great.. 
Cons:. Hate the tiny little lettering in the menu.. 
Summary:. Not a bad player considering that I got it on clearance.. 

$$;
Pros:. WiFi and USB. 
Cons:. None found yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything works, including my universal remote. Decent DVD picture quality and great sound. Netflix streaming works as advertised and BD-Live also performs as advertised (although I haven't found any compelling content through it).. 
Cons:. Slightly slow load, slightly loud.. 
Summary:. Great value and much better unit than I expected. Replaced Oppo upscaling DVD player and am happy I did. Everything works and at a price that makes sense. Just remember this: if the movie was terrible before Blu-Ray, it still is and 1080p won't change anything.. 

$$;
Pros:. Upconversion, check. Plays Blu-Ray, check. Wi-Fi inlcuded so you can stream Netlifx (subscription needed) and Pandora, check. Priced below other units that do the same, CHECK!. 
Cons:. It does't do the dishes nor is it a PS3 but it does cost $150 less!. 
Summary:. I dare you to buy a new Blu-Ray that does more for less money. Good luck. Just buy it and enjoy.. 

$$;
Pros:. this one seems like a unit that has good price to perfromance ratio. has all required features.. 
Cons:. brand name.. 
Summary:. if you don't want to spend a lot of maney, go for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looking for Wi-FI - BluRay and Netflix streaming in one box at an affordable price. 
Cons:. Don't own yet ;). 
Summary:. Well this sure would be a nice late Christmas present.... Good luck All :). 

$$;
Pros:. havent seen any bad reviews for this one unlike the samsung 1600 or 1590 which has a history of not working after a few weeks. 
Cons:. a little more expensive than the 149 but may be worth it. 
Summary:. good luck me. 

$$;
Pros:. Netflix is great, but needs more options for streaming.. 
Cons:. Would like to see this with an HDD to DVR too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Streaming directly from Netflix.. 
Cons:. Not sure if there is anything I dislike so far. Love Insignia products.. 

$$;
Pros:. Netflix streaming, Wireless connectivity, Blu ray. 
Cons:. Remote Control. 
Summary:. I bought this unit mainly for its Netflix streaming and wireless capabilities. The video streaming quality is very good. Configuring the wireless settings took about 10 minutes and another 5 to update the firmware. I purchased on sale from BB for $149. The blu ray video quality is good. The remote control for this unit is really bad and has a cheap look to it. The signal strength is poor and the buttons tend to stick. I was able to setup this unit with my Logitech Harmony One Universal Remote and it works flawlessly. So, all and all a good unit for budget minded people.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has WiFi connections and netflex streaming is nice. 
Cons:. not easy to set up. 

$$;
Pros:. Best priced Blu-Ray player with Wi-Fi. 
Cons:. Don't knwo yet. 
Summary:. Looking forwarding to trying this product. 

$$;
Pros:. wifi ethernet plus usb! What a deal.. 
Cons:. don't now the cons yet. 
Summary:. I just found out that Insignia made a blueray player with features such as ethernet and wifi ethernet plus USB on a blueray player forunder $200.00! What a deal. If I can get one I will write an honest review.. Keith. 

$$;
Pros:. The Price Is Right.Not the TV show.. 
Cons:. seems like it might be made a little cheaply.. 
Summary:. I probably would NOT buy one. But, for free,it's for me.... 

$$;
Pros:. I like the price and the features addressed in the user review. Hope I win one!. 
Cons:. I can't say anything about it...yet. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is great. Satin black finish is great and resists reflections that other glosser finishes produce.. 
Cons:. No universal remote. Will not "step back" in pause frame shuttle mode. Annoying blinking WIFI lights light up rear wall behind unit, allthough electric tape solved that one.. 
Summary:. I started my Blu-Ray search when Netflix came to these units. I started with the Samsung 3600 but returned it a week later because it just seemed very primitive compared to my SONY DVD players I've used for years. In disk mode, there was no Stop/Resume memory, and no frame by frame shuttle in reverse. Two functions I use all the time. But the Samsung did have some features that the Insignia unit was missing after trying both out. On the Samsung, when in Netflix mode, I liked how you could see the quality meter change depending how strong of a signal was being received wirelessly at the time. The Insignia doesn't let you know if there?s a signal problem. With the Samsung, sometimes opening a door in my room cleared a path for better quality video. The Insignia also doesn't include a universal remote and my Mitsubishi 57734 doesn't recognize this unit either. So I?m remote juggling between volume and Play. The Samsung was recognized right away by my Mitsubishi remote and vice versa via HDMI. No extra remote programming needed. On both units, on all 3 of the same Blu-Ray's I?ve watched, they don?t "resume" when you stop the disk. It starts up from scratch every time, from Load to Previews to Disk Menu to beginning of movie. Not sure if that?s normal? I thought only some disks don't resuem after stop.. As far as the Netflix streaming quality, I?d say it?s like a non-HD cable channel, only fit to the full, not stretched, 16:9 screen. I have no complaints there, after all it is streaming.. So I thought I was only trading down in price, but I was trading down quite a few very usable features as well. I?m going to return this one next, and I'm going to try the PS3, though not a gamer, and see if maybe it has any better features. I heard PS3?s are more user friendly and now that it offers Netflix, seems like a logical choice since I enjoyed Sony players so much before. If I don?t like the PS3, I might then try the LG. And if that one still doesn?t cut it, as of now, I?d most likely go back to the Samsung.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good value. Easy setup. Netflix wifi streaming appears smooth with only minor occasional studders during HD streaming only.. 
Cons:. Remote control is often responsive. Could not setup universal remote so not sure if codes are available for this unit. Startup on the blueray disc is noisy. Only works with Netflix, no online music streaming. First test of BD live did not work.. 
Summary:. If I continue to have problems with the remote I will likely take this unit back. I was unable to program a universal remote to see if I could circumvent this problem. The streaming feature is consistent and offers excellent picture quality. I liked the controls for Blu-Ray/DVD, however the unit is noisy until the movie starts. Could not get BD live to work yet, though the unit is connected to the internet. Disappointing that Netflix is the only online service.. Updated. on Feb 27, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Price seems decent, but you get what you pay for.. 
Cons:. Limitations of formats accepted, no hard wired etherenet for high speed &#38; secure interface.. 
Summary:. Price seems decent, but may still opt for PS3, simply for quality and versatility.. GO CNET!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. what i like about this product is that you can stream netflix and pandora radio without too much hassle.. 
Cons:. can't connect to bd live even though i am hard plugged into my internet connection.. with verizon fios router i can't use wifi. customer service said it was due to having the wrong router. REALLY!?. 
Summary:. bottom line, if you just want a blu ray player that can play blu ray and dvds and stream pandora and netflix this is the one for you. if you want to use wifi call your internet provider and make sure that your router is compatible with the player. if you want to use the bd live feature that is on most blu rays that i own then dont get this player. if you are reading theis review and can tell me how to use it let me know. i keep getting asked to make sure that i am connected to the internet when i try even though i just used netflix. go figure.. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. luckily i got mine as a christmas present so i didn't waste the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. EXCELLENT VALUE for having built-in Wi-Fi at its price, great picture quality, easy Wi-Fi setup. 
Cons:. Response to the remote control is terrible. Must point DIRECTLY at the player and even then had to push buttons 2 or 3 times before the player would respond. Might have better response if you have a universal remote you can program for this device.. 
Summary:. This could have been the been the absolute best valued DVD player out there for the price with having built-in Wi-Fi support, except for one seemingly minor but fatal flaw. I can't necessarily recommend agains this player, but you should definitely know what to expect of this flaw before you buy it. Some may be able to live with the flaw, and if you can, then it's an otherwise excellent blu-ray player. I can not and have returned this player becuase of it. It's such a good deal otherwise I really hated to but I just couldn't live with the flaw. First the positive. This is the best priced blu-ray player out there with built-in Wi-Fi, period. It's regular price is $179. I got it on sale for $149. Every other blu-ray player I've seen with built-in Wi-Fi costs $229 or higher. At $149 on sale this thing was a steal! Even at the regular price of $179 it's a heck of a deal. Picture quality is great. Never tried the Netflix streaming (I'm not a Netflix user) but other user reviews have said it worked well. The Wi-Fi was very easy to set up (I don't understand other reviews that say they've had trouble setting up the Wi-Fi, I can only guess they have problems with their Wi-Fi network in general). Plug a 4 Gb USB drive, which can be had for about $12 on sale these days, in the back and you're all set for BD-Live. Okay, now for the bad part, the flaw. The unit's response to the remote control is HORRIBLE. I had to point the remote DIRECTLY AT the player to get any response at all and even then I often had to press buttons 2 or 3 times before it responed. If you have a universal remote you can program it MAY work better. I have a high end Philips ProntoPro NG remote. I programmed the Pronto to control the DVD player and with regular Infrared it works fine. But I also have an RF (radio frequency) adapter for my Pronto remote and using that, it didn't work. I had to ge the RF receiver (the device that receives the RF and converts it back to infrared) about 10 ft from the front of the player before it would work. Well, my room is about 15 feet long and I normally have the RF receiver at the back of the room and it doesn't work from that distance. But if you use just plain infrared with a high quality universal remote, it will probably be fine. I'm not willing to live without the universal remote and radio frequency adapter capability. The remote control is my ONLY complaint about this device though. If it weren't for the remote problems, I would have given this device a full 5 stars. It's such a shame that an otherwise fantastic device, especially for its price, is shackled by what you'd think should be the least of your worries in how well the remote control responds..

$$;
Pros:. Nothing - cheap disc tray, loud mechanism, just really cheap.. 
Cons:. Remote is cheap, buttons feel horrible. When entering a command, it takes forever for each key stroke. Customer support is worthless. Had to download and make a ISO before I could even start to setup the net connection. And that did not work either.. 
Summary:. Not worth it for any price. Tech support just tells me to upgrade my wireless access port even though my wireless works with all 5 of my PCs and my Wii. But it wont work with Insignia junk. Save your money and buy a name-brand product..
