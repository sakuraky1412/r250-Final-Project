Pros:. This TV has the best bundle of picture quality, inputs, settings and ease of use available, maybe I'm bias, but nothing can touch it for the price I paid - open box, clearance with all accessories and extended 4 yr warrantee for $800!. 
Cons:. TV is great and only new features on new TV make this seem to have any cons. The biggest issue I have is the fight over who will watch movies on this versus our older tv in another room. The other issue, I can't find another one for the same price.. 
Summary:. I researched all options to watch movies in a darkened room. Excellent picture was my most important criteria, within the budget my wife would allow. Found recommended settings for the picture from several sources, tried them all and found what I liked best... and it is awesome. I was expecting the increased black levels, and when it happened, I tweeked the settings and still love the picture. While I now wish I would have waited for the g20 or g25, buyer remorse maybe, but in our house, only I noticed the increase black level, so maybe "typical viewers" won't notice.. The TV does have a 24p playback mode, but for me it is not usable with the flicker. This is the only feature I wish I could make work for me, but I am not willing to pay the premium for a set that has this feature.. 

$$;
Pros:. When I got my TV, it was excellent because it has 600 HZ, and Full, HD 1080p. It has lots of color especially when I watch PIXAR movies. It works well with my Samsung Blue-Ray player. Also I can put SD cards so I can see pictures on my TV.. 
Cons:. The TV in standard definition isn?t what I expected, it was 480i, 60HZ.But that wasn?t all, when I watch a movie on a DVD player; it showed the worst definition an excellent HDTV can have. That is why I ask for a Blue-Ray player for Christmas.. 
Summary:. I think this TV is excellent because it has 1080p, 600HZ. This TV can select SD cards on your TV for you to see pictures. It can download movies on the internet, so that way you don?t watch the movie without walking a mile to get your rented movie in the mail. This TV shows high crystal clear definition without any blur .Cause with 1080p, you can see every object perfectly, and with 600HZ, it can draw more details, and it?s drawn faster. This TV is something you can ask for your birthday, or for Christmas for your family. It is one of the best TVs in the world, and it will be the best TV I ever got.. Andre. Austin Texas. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture. THX. Connectivity.. 
Cons:. If you like to fiddle with color controls, others have more controls than this. There are plenty for me and the presets are good.. 
Summary:. One of the best choices.. 

$$;
Pros:. The color is amazing. Could not find anything like this set for hundreds more.. 
Cons:. THX is not worth watching.. 
Summary:. Researched for months and kept coming back to the G10. Compared it to LG and Samsung side by side by side with the same movie showing and it won easily. Walked into our local store and there it was for $400 less than Future Shop.... we walked home with the Panasonic BD60 blu-ray player and waited for the set to arrive. Wonderful combo!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, black level, THX mode, NO IR/Burn-In!, color accuracy, ease of use, styling, internet connectivity, black level, PS3 and XBOX 360 gaming, response time, refresh rate, black level, everything..... 
Cons:. No swivel stand. Maybe mediocre sound... But if you have this TV without a sound system, you are moronical.. 
Summary:. This is the perfect television.... and I have done my research. This is what I wanted from a home theater viewing experience... and it is an experience. I previously had the Samsung PN50B650 and Panasonic S1 in my house, and there is no comparison. In my opinion, the debate between Panasonic vs. Samsung is over. There is a clear winner in picture quality, and that winner is Panasonic. Simply superior technology.. Same could be said about Plasma vs. LCD (including LED based LCD TV's). Plasma is the superior technology. It (unfortunately) got a bad rap in it's infancy due to burn-in issues and short life span. BUT THESE PROBLEMS ARE COMPLETELY GONE!!!! It is up to people like me and other plasma owners to let the world in on what we are experiencing. LED refresh rate, response time, black level, side angle viewing and color accuracy can't compete with plasmas. Period. They are making great strides, but are still trying to catch up and mirror the picture quality of a plasma.. In conclusion, I have waited for 8 years to get a HDTV. This is the purchase of my adult life. I was not biased or swayed any way toward any specific brand or type of TV except for looking at it myself. If you are looking to get a new, incredible, image-"popping", blu-ray playing, video gaming, life changing, LIVING ROOM HUB...... GET A PANASONIC PLASMA. Specifically, the Panasonic TC-P50G10.. -J Lyndon Hughes. 

$$;
Pros:. - SD-HD card displays photo files like a huge framed picture.. - Built in internet gives access to YouTube and Picasa web content.. - HDTV picture quality is stunning'!. - VieraLink works. 
Cons:. - Shiny black finish of the base is easily marred with terrycloth towels. Lesson: Use microfiber cloths for any dust removal or cleaning.. 
Summary:. TV is a much different experience with HD and 50 inches of Plasma! I am so happy I gave away the old Sony XBR (worked perfectly) and made this purchase. If your on the fence, get off and go buy this TV. It is awesome!. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, Features, Picture, Black levels, Great for gaming, THX mode, 5 1080p inputs, Vierra Cast, SD slot, remote feels great in you hand. New plasma technology makes me sleep weel at night.. 
Cons:. Speakers (Surround Sound fixes this). They are not horrible, but they could be better. Needs a swivel stand &#38; bulit in Wifi.. 
Summary:. Great out of the box picture. Bluray, PS3 &#38; Xbox 360 all look phenomenal. Sexy bezel &#38; easy to figure out. 3 years ago i was a staunch LCD guy. My 42" Sharp Aquos had a great picture, but after reading the reviews &#38; going to the store to see one in person I was sold. I have french doors about 5 feet away from this TV &#38; glare is not an issue with this set.. Also my LCD had horrible picture wash out from slightly off angle, this set...perfect. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking for a new TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, black levels, price. 
Cons:. The speakers are weak but actually a little better than I expected. If you are buying a TV like this you should already have surround sound. 
Summary:. After a month or so of research I settled on this TV and I couldn't be happier with my decision. I went back and forth between this TV, the V10, and the Samsung PN50B850. After reading a bunch of negative reviews about the Samsung having a "buzzing" problem I had to choose between the G10 and the V10. I got the people at BestBuy to setup the two TV sets side by side to do some comparison. I brought the recommended settings from this site and tweaked each TV. In all honesty, the picture quality was nearly identical. The V10 has a very nice single sheet of glass coving the TV and looks sleeker than the G10. The 24P @90 is a great feature to the V10, but I couldn't decide if it ultimately was worth spending an extra $500 to get. I decided to do a little more research before buying the TV and discovered Sears was selling the G10 for $1299, $300 less than BB. BestBuy priced matched 110% of the difference and that made my decision simple. $1269 for the G10 vs $2099 for the V10 was a no brainer for me. I have had the TV for two months now and have not regretted my decision even slightly. After breaking it in for 150 hours I tweaked all the settings and the picture is fantastic. Deep blacks, rich colors, and overall great performance make this one the best TVs I have ever owned. I would highly, highly recommend this set to anybody.. 

$$;
Pros:. natural color, bightness enogh for a bright room,smooth motion,wide viewing angel,. 
Cons:. sound quality. 
Summary:. this panny easily surpassed any lcd so far.. in my opinion only V10 better than this. 

$$;
Pros:. Remote is okay. THX appears to be exact on broadcast HD. Cannot stop from watching TV.. 
Cons:. It was not free. SOUND IS POOR, but for regular TV it can grow on you and work well enough. I see the TV in my dreams now.. 
Summary:. I am 100 percent new to HDTV, never had an LCD, and this is the first large screen TV I owned. I really cannot say this TV has any flaws. THX appears to provide EXACT REAL LIFE COLORS, which can be altered some to your liking. SD is soft and theater like. Many SD channels appear sharp, but did notice a little soft edges. HDTV looks better (at home) than any LCD I saw IN STORE. Actually, I do not believe an LCD TV can proform as well as this Plasma. Viewing angles are great 170 degree in NOT impossible. MOTION is perfect fast and exact. THX is NOT too green, and cause enough to buy and why I did, Not disapointed (yet). I did not adjust VIVID mode, but not good setting as is. When at a store I would be attracted to the bright LCDs and would not like the appearent Darker Plasmas, at home I tell you I would not want it brighter THERE is no real darkness or green tint phenomena, people are just picking. I have it on warm 2, but I read here that cool or other setting may even look better. Okay, yes I imagined I saw a somewhat greenish tint in a couple faces's skin color, but I know that is because the natural real skin color is/was suppose to have that tint look to make the person look a little rough white and washed out. So I can say even the dark..or green tint reviewed statements was ignorance, or subjective. Another cause it when first turned on the THX appears to darken the screen. I did not test the brightness with a meter, and therefore, i must conclude that it is an illusion and in real case situations it does not exist. Every one sees color differently, and only an objective set of measurements can tell the difference anyway. I have this TV in a FULL light room with the sun shining on the screen, and it reflects much less than a normal glass tube TV WOW! I even had to look for the light reflection! Again, I had it in THX brighness not set high. WOW, and I thought the Bright loud unfocused LCDs would be better! Glad I was not fooled!! I must agree with one review I read, :JUST TURN ON THX" and get the best of the best. I do not know how THX was calibrated or configered in the hardware, I read one review that stated it was just a preset MODE, and nothing worth paying any more for, all I can say is; "it is exact." I never had an LCD (and know it could not match this) I never had a Plasma before. I have yet to watch a DVD or Blu-Ray. I can imagine that more controls would be nice, but then it would be more possible to screw-up the picture and chips, so it may be best as is. THX and mild adjusted brightness, and warmness etc. This is a real life review, from a person that never even owned a large screen TV before. For such a person, I think this is the TV. Why would I want to buy a large item and find basic short comings like poor motion, focus, brightenss, and color? I could not risk it, so I got the G10. I doubt the V10 would add much real people value. Therefore, upgrade s1 to G10 appears valid, but not G10 to V10. However, what makes this TV certainly will be placed in lower cost TVs soon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price vs Perfomance,. 
Cons:. the remote is lacking (only a few button light up). 
Summary:. I did my research before buying this TV and I could not be happier! It has an amazing picture, looks beautiful, and the price was right.. 

$$;
Pros:. -1080p movie and Xbox 360 looks amazing. - THX mode makes movie look amzing. - Problably the best plasma behind the Pioneer Kuro. - Amazing black levels. - Tons of inputs including PC and media slots. - Silver and black outside looks great. 
Cons:. -Wish the TV has wireless internet, needs a ethernet cord to use web based apps. 
Summary:. Buy this TV if you want an amazing movie expeince without spending $3000. Panasonic makes very solid TV sets that do not break like others do.. 

$$;
Pros:. incredible picture and great price. 
Cons:. none so far... 
Summary:. I am thoroughly satisfied... 

$$;
Pros:. the picture quality is very good and the gaming is a top notch.. 
Cons:. not enough picture settings. 
Summary:. a must buy for people who dont want to spend a lot on a tv. 

$$;
Pros:. Best TV in the world. 
Cons:. it isn't free. 
Summary:. Best TV in the world. Still miss the ambilight from my phillips though...... 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality.. Great deep black levels.. Color accuracy is very good.. Overall very good HDTV.. 
Cons:. Don't like the PC input is on the side, it somewhat sticks out and visible.. 
Summary:. Panasonic continues to prove that its plasmas are the very best in the market. Price and quality go hand in hand.. 

$$;
Pros:. THX Mode. PC hook up. 3 HDMI inputs. Price compared to other well reviewed 1080p plasmas. Built in TV tuner. No motion blur on fast moving objects.. 
Cons:. Remote is not universal. 
Summary:. THX mode is great, it's more dim than the other modes but I prefer it that way. The other ones seem too bright.. My favorite feature is that I can run all of my audio sources into the TV (HDMI, Component and Composite) and run one optical and one AV out to my receiver so I don't have to change the input on my receiver anymore, I can just leave the receiver on the TV input and when the signal is digital I get Dolby Digital and when it's not I get ProLogic.. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this TV to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. great black levels, handles motion much better than any lcd i have seen. 
Cons:. none that i can think of. 
Summary:. For blu ray movies, ps3, xbox 360, this is an awesome panel. No motion blur, deep blacks, and suprisingly very bright picture. I have owned 2 plasmas prior to the G10, also a Sony Sxrd tv, and this plasma blows the others away in picture quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture with tons of usefull features. 
Cons:. Exterior styling is exactly ground breaking and I was hoping for more HDMI inputs. Of course with all plasmas the glass screan does reflect a lot of light.. 
Summary:. Comming from a 4 year old rear projection LCD I gotta say that TV tech has come a long way. even though I thought my old sony had a nice picture and worked well with my peripherals this Panasonic blows it out of the water in every way imaginable. I've had the TV for a couple of months now and couldn't be happier.. 

$$;
Pros:. There is no better value in a HDTV at this moment. This set has excellent black levels and gorgeous colors. Other reviews have commented that light output in THX mode is dim but if you position this TV in a really dark room it is bright enough.. 
Cons:. Sound maybe be a little thin but that is the case with most TV's. I do wish the 3rd HDMI port was on the front panel. Do yourself a favor and partner this baby with a good soundbar or better yet a decent midlevel receiver.. 
Summary:. I looked at and researched several TV's including the new Samsung B series and a Pioneer and 2 Sony LCD's and frankly even without the price advantage(I paid $1511 at Amazon) I know I made the right choice with the Panny. I am so satisfied that I am in danger of becoming a couchpotato.LCD screens may be brighter but Plasma is a much more natural picture. Also motion is displayed much smoother than on even much more expensive 120hz TV's. Until OLED technology becomes wide spread this TV is The Bomb Baby!.. 

$$;
Pros:. deep color , vivid color , very bright. 
Cons:. i cant see. 
Summary:. if you set picture mode @ vivid and contrast @ 100 then you can see one of the brightest HDTV ever with realy natural color.. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredible picture and everything I wanted it to be. The cnet review is spot on and kudos to the editors as the reviews prompted my purchase of his tv.. 
Cons:. Every "con" (if one could say this tv has cons) on this tv is clearly stated in the editors review and is absolutely dead on. I would have nothing further to add.. 
Summary:. This plasma is just quite spectacular! I am blown away with every bluray I watch.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has improved a lot on the image quality along with improved black level making this a great HDTV. I recommend you to check out http://www.squidoo.com/best-hdtv and http://best.lcd.ever.com for information on the best and cheapest HDTV this year.. 
Cons:. I think Sony and Samsung are still slightly better than the Panasonic.. 
Summary:. As an electronics sales I think LCDs have more advantages to the plasma. I give it a five star for trying hard to improve from the previous models.. 

$$;
Pros:. deep black level, accurate color in THX mode , Excellent greyscale accuracy , fast response for gaming.. 
Cons:. accurate color only on THX mode , No Colour Management System , THX mode looks Dim and there is`nt any light contorol. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent black's, stunning color and a really great price. I really do enjoy this set. The anti reflective screen works really well, THX mode is really all i use, and it is really well featured.. 
Cons:. speaker's really do kinda suck but a set like this is really made for surround. a little more control over pic settings would have been nice.. 
Summary:. anyone looking to purchase a new tv should really stop and take a look at this set. stunning picture quality, excellent feature's and a great price. and if you need another expert review check out hd guru's review of this set, they scored it higher in nearly every catagory than pioneer's 141 except solid black's and it came close but they did say the panasonic had better dark shadow detail.. 

$$;
Pros:. - The price is awesome.. - Better picture than any other 50" currently available.. 
Cons:. I'd prefer a matte frame.. 
Summary:. Like many, I researched ad nauseam before purchasing this set. LCD?s aren?t as natural, giving off a fake brightness which causes viewer fatigue after prolonged viewing, so the latest plasma offering is the best viewing experience available in my opinion.. I had a budget of up to $2500, and toyed with the Samsung A550 58? panel for $2100, the Pioneer 5020 50? for $2000, or this one for $1700 street ($1999 retail). Best Buy had just received two of the G10s, and was kind enough to set up one while I waited. They had it set up next to the Pioneer 5020 and I was stunned. Heck, even the sales rep was surprised. After all, the Pioneer is IT when it comes to plasmas.. Not this time. The G10 was even more natural, showing that the Pioneer 5020 was over saturated, almost giving the impression that the picture was computer generated.. At first, the Pioneer appeared brighter and the colors more rich, but upon further examination, it was not natural at all, but an exaggerated representation of the real scene. As a result, the Panasonic appeared more soft, but without any hint of a cloud layer over the top. It was a truer representation of the actual scene, which also gave it a greater 3D look. Objects appeared where they should in space, making the experience more involving.. Panasonic has done a great job with this new lineup, and for the money it?s just sick. I?d have preferred the 54? of this model, but it?s not going to be out for another 3 months (June) and I couldn?t wait.. Updated. on Apr 10, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent (and accurate) color and contrast, deep blacks, attractive design, and Internet connectivity. 
Cons:. Ugly on-screen interface, lacks extensive picture controls, cannot properly display 24p (too much flicker), some greyscale banding, Vieralink seems (already) dated by Yahoo! widgets some newer sets feature, some "dancing" pixels when screen is bright. 
Summary:. After 10 months of ownership, it's time to review.... Months of research looking for the perfect gaming and Blu-ray watching set led me to this Panasonic plasma. It's incredible. I'm sure you've read again and again how good the picture is so I won't spend ages telling you what you already know. In summation, the black levels are impeccable, the colors and contrast are excellent, and response time is great.. Picture and Performance [4.5/5]. As mentioned, the picture is incredible.The set claims to handle 24p signals but the flicker is awful when the screen is bright, which renders this function pointless. I find the THX mode too dark but the Custom settings posted by Cnet do the trick for watching Blu-ray movies. When the screen displays areas of (near) white, small "dancing" pixels are noticeable. A good example of this is in the Dark Knight when Christian Bale and Morgan Freeman are descending/ascending the cargo lift/elevator into the large white-tiled room. This may be film noise or something else but it kind of bothers me at times. Greyscale banding is noticeable when displaying b/w photos on-screen. For gaming, the set really shines. PS3 @ 1080p looks fantastic. Xbox 360 @ 720p look nice (I'm stuck with a pre-HDMI model). The Wii @ 480p looks mediocre but bearable. If you're worried about burn-in, don't be. 90% of the time my set is on I'm playing a game and I've never had image retention last longer than a few minutes. Additionally, the set handles 480i signals well.. Construction [5/5]. Sleek and stylish. It's a very attractive set that screams quality. The set makes a little noise (electrical hum) while it's on but it's only noticeable during silent scenes. Some will argue that glare is a concern but I consider it a non-issue as the set does an excellent job of preventing glare compared to my old CRT. Connectivity is average and adequate--no complaints there.. Vieralink &#38; Features[3.5/5]. It's nice to watch YouTube videos and view Picasa pics but overall the interface is a bit ugly. Moreover, the controls are sluggish and typing on the remote is downright painful. It seems Yahoo! widgets enabled TVs out stride Vieralink. No WiFi and occasionally connectivity is fickle though that may be my local connection. Viewing pictures on the set is slow but a nice feature.. Other things to think about. &gt; It heats up the room a little bit (not great from warmer climates). &gt; It consumes more power than a comparable LCD. &gt; Burn-in IS possible but difficult (be careful not to pause and forget). &gt; It's delicate. The large pane of glass can easily crack if you tilt the set to far from vertical.. &gt; It has an incredible viewing angle.. &gt; More inches and quality for the money compared to LCD.. &gt; The picture is wonderful!. Updated. on Jul 4, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture. Excellent value compared to LCD. Sleek looking. Panasonic name &#38; reputation.. 
Cons:. Energy consumption high compared to LCD. Break in period required?. 
Summary:. I had a similar experience with several earlier reviewers. After researching all these TVs ad nauseum, I saw one live in the big box store &#38; was completely underwhelmed. However, I held my breath &#38; bought one from an on line retailer anyway. Couldn't be happier now. Looks nothing like what I saw in the store. It's plenty bright for any situation &#38; despite the "lack of color adjustments" it has a spectacular, accurate display.. I'd recommend this TV to anyone based on price/value/performance. Spending $500+ more for only marginal improvements isn't worth it to me.... 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate colors, 1080p really makes the difference, the size matters 50", great for blu-ray movies and video games, lots of connectivity inputs and uotputs, easy to use and setup, excellent motion performance.. 
Cons:. Standar definition below average, glossy frame is a fingerprint and scratches magnet, colors could be brigther.. 
Summary:. I bought this TV primary for movies watching, and I couldn�t make a better choise, I also play vide games once in a while and it handles great.. If your concern is any of this two that this TV is the right choise for you, although I would recommend a LCD if your primary objective is vide games.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture, features, ease-of-use, everything. A ridiculous value.. 
Cons:. - Limited picture controls won't appeal to hardcore AV nerds/control freaks.. - no picture-in-picture. 
Summary:. Allow me to address the following first:. "And as with last year's sets, selecting 48Hz on the G10 causes flicker--more intense in brighter areas, but visible pretty much constantly--that basically renders the image unwatchable.". This is outrageous! I watched the Blade Runner Blu-Ray last night with a PS3 at 48Hz on this set and I could NOT find this flicker even when I tried hard to see it. The only flicker I could see was on the still images of the menu elements but that's is perfectly normal because it's not film. The film itself looks amazing. Pans didn't stutter at all and overall it beautifully recreated the feel of film as opposed to the electronic, clinical look of high frame rates. It's just absurd to me that CNET is encouraging users to ignore one of the best features of this set. OF COURSE 48Hz has a noticeable "flicker" - it's a lower frame rate dummy. But you're still getting double the frame rate of when you go to a theater. Did you get that? You get the benefit of reproducing accurate film cadence while getting twice the frame rate resolution of a film you'd see in the theater.. I just can't express how stupid this criticism is. Perhaps if CNET doesn't like the look of low frame rates they shouldn't go to the movies anymore. The way they describe it you would think the picture is freaking out or something. It's pretty much the opposite of "unwatchable" - it's the best I've ever seen film look on a TV.. Next up, we have the "THX is too dim and green" stuff.. Again this is not a deal-breaker like some paint it to be. First of all THX, mode looks fantastic. The colors make films look perfect. Don't use this setting for anything else besides film content. It's not meant for TV, video or games. It's meant to be used for 24p film sources. And let me make it clear that THX is as adjustable as the other modes. It can be brightened and the color can be modified. I recommend using the "Warm 1" setting instead of the one CNET says. Warm2 is too green. Lastly THX is not meant to be used in lit rooms. It's intended for movie watching in the dark room.. If you want a a picture comparable to THX mode but with more light output, I recommend using the Custom mode and applying the settings CNET uses for that mode: http://forums.cnet.com/5208-19410_102-0.html?threadID=337556. I noticed some on youTube are posting videos of so-called "phosphorous lag" with this set. I noticed this too but it's extremely subtle and is difficult to recreate unless you make a point to try to. The only time I can see it is when I quickly look away from the TV - but who the hell watches TV like that??. In every way this is the ultimate TV for this price range. Ignore the noise and go for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Black levels, Accurate colors, bold bright colors, price, remote control, did I mention the picture.. 
Cons:. Sound leaves a bit to be desired but more than adequate for viewing TV, especially if you have surroud sound for games and movies.. 
Summary:. Paid $1299 from best buy and the picture makes HDTV and Games as crisp and vibrant as I've seen on any TV to date. My friend has a Kuro and honestly between the two I couldn't pick a winner for best picture so I'd have to go for best price, Panasonic FTW!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture Quaility is outstanding,. 
Cons:. The sound is poor. 
Summary:. I bought this television besause i watch a lot of movies and play games, i also pefer Plasmas over LCDs. But i am disappionted that you can't adjust the 600Hz subfield drive so you can see the difference with it on or off like you can with LCDs.. 

$$;
Pros:. The bets panasonic Blacks!. 
Cons:. In PZ85 appreciate the difference when the IFC was ON / OFF, the G10 is not appreciated....I think this firmware need update. 

$$;
Pros:. Eye-popping gorgeous colors and clear picture. Rich blacks. Excels at animated film viewing. Enough functions to appropriately adjust the color.. 
Cons:. I wish screen was less reflective (best to watch this HDTV with the shades drawn). White vistas (like snow) "vibrate." Motion blur when panning can make me nauseous.. 
Summary:. I bought this TV in December 2009 (and I am amazed the price has yet to drop!) after discovering LCD's really hurt my eyes. I now have to fight from becoming a couch potato with all the TV programs in HDTV and the blu ray movie releases. I have not seen a drop in black levels as claimed by some and I do like to watch movies in THX (I find the picture more like a movie theatre). As I stated in the cons, the "whites" vibrate at times and sometimes the motion blur when watching blu ray discs makes me nauseous (I noticed motion blur in movie theaters too, but perhaps it's just intensified on a small screen). Yes I would buy this HDTV again!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Plasma TV. 
Cons:. 4:3 shows have grey color background on the sides, instead of black.. 
Summary:. I almost purchased this Plasma, but hesitated. However, I'm glad I did. Within my 3 day wait, the less expensive on-line retailers went out of stock of this TV. It appears that it is being discontinued, and replaced with the TC-P50G15. The G15 is about 2" thinner and has an extra anti-glare coating. Other than that, identical.. I found the G15 for a slightly less price than the best G10 price I ever found on-line, at a local Video Only store. The LG BD390 was also cheaper there as well.. 

$$;
Pros:. I caught it on sale at Best Buy for $1299. Couldn't beat that price. Was looking for LED but went Plasma. Excellent picture without calibration. THX mode is optimum for low-lighted room. Sound is pretty good for a TV.. 
Cons:. No major cons. The picture settings other than THX mode are not good. They're either too bright or too dim. That's about it.. 
Summary:. this is a great TV. Now that Pioneer isn't making HDTVs any longer, this makes Panasonic the Flat-panel HDTV company to beat. And for good reason.. 

$$;
Pros:. high def looks outstanding, one touch calibrating. screen anti reflective filter best ive seen, very hard to retain still images in screen(burn in). 
Cons:. has very slight green tint in thx. remote not user friendly, no instant picture button.. processor chip not the greatest in standard def. verv slight ghosting in hd on a bright scene.. 
Summary:. bottom line in thx mode to get rid of green tint, use cnets custom settings and enable c.a.t.s. looks the same as thx exept without the tint, also i dropped the color down to 38 instead of 40 looks perfect. more than enough picture light in a low lit room, it doesn't have to be pitch black, i still scwint at bright scenes. THIS IS A GREAT T.V. i looked hard at samsung, lg, visio, if u need cinamatic quality this is the t.v. for standard dvds u can go with a great upscaler like oppo and blow away all aspects of any other brand plasma..

Pros:. Motion Looks great, Blacks (inky is a great description), Fair bit of connectivity, Veira Cast, Price less than $1400 its a steal. It does kind of sit precariously in the middle of Pana's lineup. V10 &#38; Z1 will be where the real kuro beating starts. 
Cons:. THX looks like junk in a lit room... If you want wow then go to vivid, No Wifi not even an adapter to buy for veiracast (Samsung did it). Colors not that great but with a calibration tool it looks great, Bad Styling last years 85u looked better!. 
Summary:. I see this TV everyday when I go to work and all I can say about it is that it has Amazing Blacks, Great Motion... This Is a mid range model people don't be expecting gold, the color isn't as good as LCD but great Price for what you get... By the way THX is garbage unless you have it in a low light setting (turns all the whites to tan) kind of nasty looking in normal light (like cnets lab). All in all Jack of all trades but really its a Master of none! If you want a Great TV and you don't bother too much with cash I would wait for the V10 or the Z1 if your big balln, Heck the LED Sammys look rather nice. But if your like most and want to try and pay some bills too then this mid level pana certainly has a great well rounded package... Oh and if your in Chattanooga come buy it from me Matt at Sears Hamilton Place!. Updated. on Aug 30, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality (Stunning esp. in THX). features (viera cast, THX, network cameras, Pc input, optical out, etc). ease of use.. 
Cons:. THX does have a very slight green tint, you literally have to look for it.. 
Summary:. I was thinking about buying this set, then I walked into Best Buy and they had this up with higher priced LCD's (samsung and Sony), as well as the other plasma I was looking at (Samsung PN50B550) and this set looked every bit as good as those higher priced LCD's ($2400+)and totally beat the samsung. Plus it has features they do not have. As far as the green tint you may have read about, it is VERY slight, and as stated above, you have to try to look for it. THX mode needs a dark room to shine as it is not intended for a bright room, but turn the lights out and be amazed.. Some reviewers knock the Panasonics for not having a ton of picture settings, well this set has as many as I need, as I am not going to fret and fuss over getting the picture right for every different thing I may watch, I have a life. It doesnt have a lot of settings because it does not need a lot of settings, and the remote is not one you have to spend a day to learn how to use, it does what you need it to do, simply.. Bottom line, if you are like me, and moneys tight. But you want great value for a great price, look at this set. My wife did not want to get this set, but after she saw what it could do, we went out and bought a blu-ray player two days later.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture is Outstanding. Anti Reflective screen is admirable. Viera Cast is nice, now that Amazon OnDemand is Available. High Contrast Ratio for Deep Blacks and Bright Whites. Very hard/Near Impossible to Burn-In. 
Cons:. No 1080p over Component. SD scaling to 1080p is mediocre. Remote sucks. THX mode is a little too dark, unable to raise contrast.. 
Summary:. My review, or blog, is about a Panasonic G10 Plasma but it starts with a Vizio. I purchased my 50 inch Vizio VP505XVT after reading a lot of outstanding reviews from every respectable HDTV critic (CNET, HDGuru, PCMag, UltimateAVMag.com). One of my favorite review quotes comes from CNet, ?Simply put, the Vizio VP505XVT is one of the better-performing plasma TVs we've tested this year from any manufacturer?. That said it all, I was sold, and I?m getting a 505XVT. The set retailed for $1599.99 at the time but Costco was selling it for $1199.99. I ran over to my local Costco at Pentagon City in Arlington VA and purchased it. For the next 85 days I loved the set. My one complaint was the Image Retention(IR), I followed the 100 hour break-in rule but found that even after the 100 hours, I still had constant IR. Nothing permanent, the IR would typically fade after 20 minutes to an hour of full screen programming. But it was a chore, constantly having to combat the IR and always trying to prevent it. I wanted a plasma though, LCD shortcoming were not acceptable to me.. I decided to replace my Visio with a brand new 2009 G10, I figured I would lose nothing. Costco has a no questions asked 90 day return policy, so I exercised it. Vizio?s Flagship, top-of-the-line plasma should be equal to Panny?s middle-of-the-road plasma, right? And for the most part they are similar. Black levels, to my eye, are no different, both produce incredibly inky blacks but small things existed on the Visio that didn?t on the Panny. What might those be you ask? 1080p-over-component. To my dismay, I plugged up my X-Box 360 to my new G10 and no picture. After fumbling around with the component cables, I learned of the G10?s shortcoming. I remembered setting my X-Box to 1080p as a test on the Vizio and it worked to my surprise. I assumed 1080p-over-component was only a feature on the most high end HDTV so I was quite happy to find it available on my Vizio Plasma for $1199.99. I purchased the G10 for $1499.99 but at the time its MSRP was $1999.99. Surely a TV as expensive at that would include a feature found on a cheaper, budget brand television. Nope, I learned that Vizio and Samsung include 1080p-over-component on all there 1080p sets now. I guess I am just stuck with 1080i for my X-Box.. My other gripe with the Panasonic G10 is it?s ability to scale an interlaced image to the native progressive display. For most channels I receive over my DirecTV satellite service it works okay, but a few channels, namely Discovery HD Theater, the very top of the screen is not filled with the picture. Kind of like a 2cm letterbox, but it doesn?t exist on the bottom of the picture, only the top. I know for a fact the Vizio didn?t do this. I used Discovery HD Theater for my plasma breaking period, because of the channels lack of a permanent channel logo and the 100% full screen HD programming. To combat this issue I used the overscan picture setting while breaking in my G10 but this was a nuisance to me. Why doesn?t it scale correctly, and why does TNTHD scale perfectly. I know the Vizio VP505XVT has a higher end video processor than the Panny. The benefit is: better scaling and de-interlacing of all non-1080p content. The SD picture quality of the 505XVT was noticeably better than on the G10.. My last complaint for the G10 is the menu and remote. There is no quick way to change picture presets. I use a brighter picture present (Custom) for daytime viewing and sporting events and THX mode for nighttime viewing and movies. This switch requires me to go multiple clicks into the menu, while the Visio had a dedicated button. Also no Universal Remote for the Panny, it only controls the TV (unless you have special Panasonic brand accessories and use VieraLink). This is easily looked past if you have a Logitech Harmony Remote, which it do, but the omission puzzles me.. Now this is not a blog to trump the Panasonic G10. I do enjoy the HD picture. I have DirecTV so I watch 95% HD content. The G10 design so pretty. I love the Television but if I can do it again, I wouldn?t have traded returned my Vizio. To me, the 505XVT performs equal to the high standards set by the G10, and even surpasses it in features (HQV video processing, 1080p-over-component, SRS Surround Sound w/ DTS decoding, Better menu and immensely more robust picture control). The only thing I find the Panasonic offers that the Visio doesn?t is: Better Anti-Image Retention and VieraCast Internet Services. Sure THX mode is there but it isn?t all that it is cracked up to be. The casual TV watcher would probably prefer a non-THX preset due to the Dim contrast presented in THX mode. Most people would be 100% happy with the beautiful Panasonic G10, as I mostly am, but believe it is a slight downgrade from the Vizio VP505XVT. Now if I never purchased the Vizio first, I would give the G10 five stars. It just sucks when you pay more money and lose features.. Updated. on May 10, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Advertised features (like new higher contrast display, LAN connectivity), reasonably attractive design, high but reasonable cost, good better than average picture and THX. 
Cons:. Fall a little short in area of picture brightness, design still have minor flows, seems like some strange issues with picture, reduced number of controls compare to last year similar models. 
Summary:. I got interested in this new model as its time for me to get rid of my bulky projection and I want a nicely designed flat display (after all it is part of the room overall look) that does not compormise on the picture quality. Started to look still last year and was thinking about Pioneer or Panasonic PZ800 or 850. Liked more Pioneer simple design and was a little concerned about some issues (like with 24p) on Panasonic but Pioneer was significantly costier. Then Pioneer closed the doors and who wants to own product that vendor does not produce anymore? Now here is new G10. CNET review looks great, model seems upgraded compare to very good PZ800 and 850. Went to the store to take a look. And spend some time watching (and even playing with some settings) G10, two other Panasonic cheaper models, one Samsung and Pioneer 2050pdp all hanging side by side on the wall. I can not say I was greatly impressed by superior quality of G10. Actually, they all were pretty close but the best (to my certain disappointment) was still Pioneer. Not just the blacks were a little "blacker", thats not a big deal, but the picture was somewhat smoother and more pleasant to eye. G10 in normal mode was slighly more harsh to me. ANd switching to THX mode showed that it was noticably dimmer. I guess you can get used to it but really should you? What about more bright room than a store? And color accuracy and gamma, etc, all important but what about just general 'watchability"? It looked to me just too dim. I guess if you reduce brightness and contrast as much as possible then some cheap Daewoo also can display accurate colors. I need both, that is acceptable brightness and contrast too. But another thing I noticed is a certain graininess in some images, particular on broadcasts. I would think its my imagination or some miscalibration if not remembering some others comments on it here on CNET from some people. I spent good deal of time trying to figure out if it is really there. I dont want to make statments, its hard to tell for sure on quickly changing images but I had a feeling that in some cases (like moving camera over green football field) I had an impression that G10 showed more grains than other displays (including other Panasonics). Looking closely it appeared like sort of pixellation on highly contrasted moving fields (again, green grass, tree leaves, etc.). Cartoons were just fine, cant say for sure about film material, but broadcasts gave me this feeling. Not so other displays. I dont know what else to say about it. CNET review does not mention anything like that. Did they miss it? Or still my imagination? ANd I dont accept this talk about how much better G10 resolves images to the grain show better than on worse resolving displays - I don't care why I have a problem, I just want not to have it. So watch carefully with this model if you decide to buy - test it yourself. As to myself I think either wait till June for V10 model or just buy Pioneer while I can and the heck with it - from what I see its still the best performer. Hopefully it will not break for couple of years and then there will even better technology.. 

$$;
Pros:. No motion blurrrrr of course it,s a plasma. 
Cons:. 1080p doesn't work for the component inputs. 
Summary:. I have this tv for 4 months. first the blacks were black now it's turning more like a dark gray than a deep black. Will Panasonic take care of this. does anybody knows?. 

$$;
Pros:. This TV has most of the features of the lauded V10. It lacks some adjustments that most people won't use anyway. It also has a more traditional frame so a buyer will have to decide if they are willing to pay more for the frameless look.. 
Cons:. This TV replaced a 3 year old Pioneer PDP 5020 that my three year old decided to toss a matchbox car through. That was a 720p, and of course i can't compare side by side, but the picture seemed clearer (less grainy and brighter) on my old Pioneer.. 
Summary:. I do think this is the best plasma screen on the market unless you want to step up to the Elite series. Bummer that Pioneer discontinued Kuro.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture, great 1080i, 720 and 480i when derived from an HD video stream.. Great features, including Amazaon video download (after upgrading firmware over the internet).. 
Cons:. User Interface is marginal. Uses 0-9/A-Z when it could use channel icons.. Too many clicks to get to sleep timer, favorites etc.. Most frequent-used buttons on remote are not bunched together (a bane to us channel surfers).. 
Summary:. This is my first flat screen, so no previous ?flat? experience to compare to. I confess to a predilection for the Sony product. My previous TV was a Sony V-class tube TV which had a great picture many one-click features such as on-screen TVGuide, sleep timer and well-placed buttons (grouped by frequency of use). It could also control other devices.. But I couldn't afford the XBR6 series so I had to hunt for the best bang-for-my-budget. Knowing that I would be stuck with my choice for many years (if my choice is reliable) and being an analytical type, I spent many an hour scanning the web looking at specifications, learning HDTV principles, reading reviews and standing in front of a lot of LCD and plasma TVs including the Pioneer KURO (not that I could afford it). CNET Reviews helped me narrow the field to this Panasonic G10 series, but I could not afford the 50 inch model until Best Buy put it on sale during July 4th weekend ($1300!).. Unfortunately, the on-screen user interface leaves is less than fun. It gets the job done, but not elegantly. Except for VieraCast, everything is displayed in numbers and letters, when it could show channel icons. The screen is large enough to present all 30 favorites at one time, but only 10 are presented at a time, but no icons. Then you have to scroll down (first move your finger to a different part of the remote) until you get to the channel of choice, or punch an oversized digit key. Most commonly-used buttons should be adjacent but aren't.. Too many clicks to get to specific favorite channel, sleep timer and other features. Wish it had on screen TVGuide (like Rovi Liquid!!).. Wish it had a variable audio output (to control). I do not have a blu-ray player so I can?t tell how 1080p looks but 1080i channels from my cable provider are great.. For the $$ this is a great deal. I just wish the user interface were more efficient and fun.. 

$$;
Pros:. Motion is incredibly smooth.. 
Cons:. Very dim picture. 
Summary:. Opted not to buy this set in favor of a Samsung 55 inch LCD. I was all set to buy this tv after doing extensive reviews. I went to the store with checkbook in hand ready to buy. I wasn't even considering anything else...until I saw it next to several other sets. This set appeared VERY dim compared to Sony and Samsung LCD sets. I cranked the brightness up to 10, tried THX mode, tried game mode, etc. Nothing seemed to help. I went to both Sears and best buy, both sets had the same issues. i just couldn't bring myself to plunk down all that money for what I thought was a dim picture. I am sure the set must have many pros to be rated so highly, but the color, clarity and vibrancy of other sets, the 55 inch samsung LCD in particular, blew this set away. Best advice, go into several stores and look at the picture before settling on one. The reviews of this set are awesome, but to me, the picture is very dark and dim.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice styling. 
Cons:. Poor color acuracy with regard to skin tones and greens( the greens looked radioactive). THX produced a unusually dim picture.. 
Summary:. Took a lot of tweeking to produce an aceptable image. I was very disapointed with the color acuracy. THX on this set is useless. I was able to get a much better picture on the standard setting with a good deal of tweeking over several days. Sending the set back and hoping for a better result with the V10 series. Wish I had a KURO.. Updated. on Apr 20, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Who knows since the review is of the 46". 
Cons:. Copying a review of the 46" model to the 50" model with only a brief mention that this is the case is not good policy. 
Summary:. Wait until you see a review of the 50". 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing outsanding.. 
Cons:. Dim and GREEEEEEEEEEN!. 
Summary:. I'm sorry, but I've seen the Pioneer 5020 and this TV side-by-side, and this one doesn't cut it. To start, THX mode is too dim and washed-out. Second, the set presents an unpleasant green cast to skin-tones.. 

$$;
Pros:. Color, sound, price.. 
Cons:. pardon the language but...GRAINY AS ****. 
Summary:. Great solid TV, I would consider owning one however all panasonic that I have seen, S1/2, C1/2, X1/2 and G10 are all ungodly grainy. Grainy to the nth degree. Let me paint a picture. I was watching Iron Man on an S1 with a samsung blu-ray player. I was roughly 5-6 ft away and noticed how grainy the picture was. I stepped back to about 12 ft and still could see it. Thinking it was just that particular TV I switched it to the G10 my store has and same thing. Thinking it had to be the disk since Panasonics are so highly regarded I switched it to a POS LG LH90 and low and behold...No more grainy. Then I switched to the PN50B850 and holy ****. Greatest picture ever... We have since moved the Iron Man blu-ray to a UN55C6500 and still no more grainy. Out of curiosity we put it on the new S2 and C2 and...still grainy. I do like the Panasonics, don't get me wrong, but I'm at a loss as to why people think so highly of the panasonics. For the size and money the Samsung 8 series Plasma's are leaps and bounds better...in my opinion..

Pros:. nice tv before 400 hours not so great. 
Cons:. black leves increased drastically after 400 hours. 
Summary:. disappointment after 400 hours black looks grey 01/19/2010. By magdielito from lorain ohio. Picture Quality3.0. Sound Quality3.0. Features3.0. What's great about it: is a nice tv but after 400 hours of use the blacks look like a old lcd. What's not so great: black after 400 hours. "panasonic is good company however this tv is suffering a black level changes after 400 hours making the tv look like a old lcd tv a tech replace the a-board but still with the problem lest hope a firmware fix this issue.". 

$$;
Pros:. Price, attractive chassis design, weight, ease of access to BASIC setup features, online availiability, plenty of online access to product research and reviews, LAN connection.. 
Cons:. THX mode very dim, internal speakers are totally useless, not an out of the box "set it and run it" TV for an HDTV newbie. Remote control "lag".. 
Summary:. Not an "Out of the box" product for an HDTV newbie! I will admit, this is the first TV of it's kind that I have owned and I have only owned it for 6 days. Although y review may be pre-mature it is MY opinion based on MY $1,300 I spent based on online reviews only. I figured "If the world likes it this much, it must be good". Well.. I just warn everyone to read ALL the pros and ALL the cons on ALL websites (Google is your friend).. I must say I made my purchase prematurely and got a tad excited over my wife's approval to let me get rid of my Sony 53" rear projection. I bought eagerly based on Internet reviews but to be honest, I guess I only looked at the number of star ratings and looked at some of the main cons (Dim and Green THX mode and 'weak' internal speakers).. These are definately items to consider. However, there are other reviews and recommended picture settings for various (THX, Custom) modes on other websites that do offer some valuable information to help the visuals a bit.. Once again, I admit to being an HDTV and Plasma "newbie" but I do know that when I walk into my local BestBuy or even Walmart for that matter and I see and hear a store display that blows my system out of the water during the first 6 days of ownership, it is a little disappointing.. They're typical store setups with just your in-store array of electronics, usually attached to a Samsung $300 Home Theater System setup whereas I'm running with an NAD T744 receiver, Paradigm center channel, sub and surrounds, Samsung BD-P1590 BluRay player, all Monster Cable HDMI, the works.. To watch any media from my input device of choice, I tend to be most happy in the preset "Game" mode in order to get the brightness and clarity I desire from comparible store displays (and this is considering the amount of ambient and natural lighting in most stores). Bottom line - I truly beleive that perhaps an earlier firmware version may have justified the earlier reviews. I updated my firmware upon initial setup and I tell ya - THX mode and "out of box" do NOT go hand in hand. As others say, it is terribly dim with an extremely green tint and the internal speakers, even at a really low volume level are nothing less than totally worthless.. Admittedly, once again a plasma newbie, but it was still $1,300 I parted with I just expected more. Having an audiophile friend and at least somewhat of an eye and ear for good sound and quality products I feel my opinion should be at least be valuable to some - the common consumer looking for a good buy.. Call me a Jerk (no pun intended) and excuse my bad analogy, but like Steve Martin once said:. "You would think that in a fancy restaurant at these prices you could keep the snails off the food! There are so many snails there you can't even see the food!. Now take those away and bring us those melted cheese sandwich appetizers you talked me out of!". - I want my toasted cheese appetizers back.. Updated. on Jul 28, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good picture quality. Deep blacks. We felt it was money well spent ... for 6 months.. 
Cons:. Sub-par sound from built-in speakers. Motion blur not as well controlled as I had expected - appeared similar to a 120-Hz LCD. Probable power surge took out the TV; the only electronic device in the house that suffered though. Cheap power supply?. 
Summary:. I called Panasonic and scheduled a house call. When the day came, the technician said there was a bad circuit board, and he had just used up his only spare on another job the day before ... He said the new one would take about a week to come in at which time he would call. A couple of days later we received a 42-inch LCD loaner while ours was awaiting parts - we found out why a loaner is needed. Oh, by the way, the Plasma's picture really does look better. Three weeks later, still no part so I checked the status of my repair online. My Case Number search turned up nothing! No record of that repair. So I called Panasonic and spent the usual amount of time on Hold that people always seem to encounter from the reviews I've read. I finally got one of the lower tier reps. He said that my part was showing as back-ordered, but had no estimated delivery date or any other information. He put me back on Hold after apologizing for doing that. When he came back on he said that he was going to transfer me to their "Viera Concierge" service as they would have more information. Oh-oh ... I've been handed off like this before and it usually means someone screwed up. This "Concierge" person comes on the phone and tells me that I don't have the part because the technician reported the repair complete. Excuse me!?!. Didn't the first rep just tell me their computer showed the part still back-ordered (strike 1)? She also said that she had called me on the 26th of August (this is the 1st of September) to inquire about my satisfaction with the repair. I told her that no one had called from Panasonic or left a message on my answering machine. She assured me she had. My Caller ID says she didn't (strike 2 for careless fibbing). After all this she told me the computer showed my circuit board as still being on back order ... with no expected arrival date. Didn't she just tell me the computer showed my repair as being complete, now which story is she going to run with (strike-3)? I mentioned that Panasonic might consider deepening their pool of spare parts and she told me that they don't carry spare parts; they just order them as they fail. See sentence number 2. Either she is mistaken or the repair technician was "mistaken" when he said he carried spare boards. I think everyone at Panasonic ought to huddle together and get their stories straightened out. Service and support are an integral part of any product. Their service just doesn't make me want to buy Panasonic in the future.. 

$$;
Pros:. Relatively inexpensive.. 
Cons:. Unatural colors. Freaky black levels. Not enough adjustments to correct these problems and make things look natural.. 
Summary:. I have no idea why this product is rated so highly. I read extensively so many glowing reviews on this TV. If you are fan of artificial looking colors and crazy deep black levels that make everything you view look dim this is the TV for you. Look around your room...how many areas in the room are so dark it looks like you are looking into a black hole? None right? Well this TV is so black in most of the darker areas that it is just annoying. There is usually nuance in black levels...you won't find that with this TV. And the colors are just freaky out of this world colors...you cannot make anything you watch on this tv look normal. I like natural looking video...call me crazy. You won't get it with this tv. No matter how you try to adjust it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of connectors, lightweight. 
Cons:. Picture quality is NOT up to par. 
Summary:. I spent a lot of time looking at reviews for this unit. Nearly everyone stated just how good the picture is. So, I bought one based on those reviews and I am here to tell you my Samsung 780P set blows this thing away. The THX mode is dark with little contrast and just not what I expected. Contrast is pegged at 100 in all modes so there is nothing more than can be tweaked.. The vivid mode is not bad but color gets too bright on some stations. Screen formatting is a pain in the beehind since not every station on Comcast seems to have a different format.. Remote is ok and backlit.. Overal, I am disappointed with the plasma.. 

$$;
Pros:. price.......... 
Cons:. To many to name. 
Summary:. Blows all Panasonic TV's out the water even the weak G10, this TV color accuracy is so amazing, with its deep blacks and whites it produces. I had a Panasonic and was disappointed in its inaccurate flesh tone and washed out deep blacks, that I sold it to get this samsung B650. Panasonic is still a good company for mediocre people but my vizio TV i had looked ten times better than that Panasonic model. Samsung has the best plasma out this year, sorry Panasonic.

Pros:. good picture. 
Cons:. broke only after 3 months of use, took over 6 weeks to have repaired. good luck with panasonic support also. have enough minutes on your cell phone?. 
Summary:. was a good tv, heard it make a sound like the screen cracked in half 3 times during a 3 month period, soon after tv went out.. 

$$;
Pros:. The first 6 months we loved this tv the picture the colors looked great. till it broke. 
Cons:. T.V broke after 6 months. its been at shop for 7 weeks all boards &#38; screen replaced still wont work Their customer service is useless. they mix our info this other &#38; can't even get our name or make of tv right we call daily &#38; they don't retur. 
Summary:. this T.V. was great for 6 months only. they have the worst customer service. So unless you have money to burn on a new T.V after 6 months don't but it. Our T.V has been down for 7 weeks almost every part replaced &#38; still more parts on back order for another 4 weeks.We told them we want out give us a refund so they told us to fax a copy of receipt &#38; surprise it didn't work we had to call 4 days before we could get anyone to verify # they have 5 fax #s and they all have been down for the past week. we had to give all our info to they 4 times they kept mixing up with other customers. We finely had the repair shop (very helpful) to call the panasonic rep. all they will give us is the sales price.. so we are out more than $130 in sales tax and out $300 for the calibration. We will never buy anything Panasonic......
