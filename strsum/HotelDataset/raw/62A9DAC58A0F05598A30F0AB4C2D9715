we showed up at our condo booked two months ago , and it was not available ; another story .

at 11:00 pm the room next door , its children still up , was unresponsive to my banging on our common door , as they had the video game or something going full volume , and the kids yelling it up .

so i dressed in my shorts and banged not their door , and finally they turned the noise off .
all of this said , they let us out of the place after paying for the one evening.
