$$;
Pros:. Pristine image quality and sound quality, easy to use once you learn the controls, and fun to film with. 
Cons:. None. I found no problems with it.. 
Summary:. An incredible camcorder that easily surpasses its main source of competition, the Sony VX2000.. 

$$;
Pros:. Flourlite Lens, Optical Zoom, Mounted zoom and recording on the handle, lightweight, clear scan, easy to pick up and use. 
Cons:. doesnt shoot in 24p and cant compete with dcr-vx2100 in low light conditions. 
Summary:. I bought this to help me become a proffesional videographer and i have to say that this is a camera that im going to stick with for years. canon really does make a good product even compared to say their xl2. I would say this could easily compete with the dvx100a, xl2, and dcrvx2100 in video quality. Maybe not in some of the features.. 

$$;
Pros:. great color, lightweight, easy to use .. 
Cons:. is no cons.. 
Summary:. i've used the vx2100 for skateboarding and the canon gl2. by far the canon gl2 takes the lead from the superior color quality.. if your thinking about a sony or a canon just go for the canon, overall it is a better camera.. best skateboard camera alive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Used for ENG and video production as a frelance photographer, this camera has helped me get the job done well for over two years now.. 
Cons:. Does not carry the SONY label so it's not looked upon as seriously... does it do the job better than the comparable SONY? Yes it does.. 

$$;
Pros:. Low light shooting is so sweet. Frame mode (24fps I think) is also hottness. I use this camera for when I am video taping skating. Fast paced action is sweet for this camera. When I am on skates taking video, the optical image stabilizer takes a lot of t. 
Cons:. One con is that the handle on the top can not take a lot of pull on it, as I recently found out.(True story) I was down in the city(Philly) and was robbed. They tried to take the camera by pullin the handle, and trying to rip it from my hands. The handle. 

$$;
Pros:. I have used the camera for a year now and I feel that I got my money's worth on this product. Great optics, picture, and features. I highly recommend this camera for professionals and pro-sumers.. 
Cons:. Plastic casing, but that is soon overshadowed by what is inside.. 

$$;
Pros:. I shopped quite a bit, and narrowed things down between the Sony VX2000 &#38; Canon GL2. So far, extremely pleased with my decision to purchase the GL2 over the (older) VX2000. Picture quality is exceptional, handling &#38; features excellent for a lower. 
Cons:. None yet, getting some wow and flutter with the onboard audio (auto leveling), but probably just settings. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought the gl2 and only used it once or twice. I also bought the battery pack that fits the gl1 and recorded over eight hours and the pack was still full. I considered the vx2000 and still considering buying it also. I'm trying to get into the videograp. 
Cons:. No con's thus far. 

$$;
Summary:. To the users who are concerned about the low light quality don't be if you use it write it provides great low light quality. I bought one for doing live music videos (dark clubs usually)and was concerned that it wouldn't provide the results I needed. At first I observed the problems "Cheule" was talking about and did see it. But I found a way of removing the graininess you use the custom presets bump the sharpness down 2 or 3 notches and bump up the setup level a notch or two. I did a shoot last week with my GL2 and I rented a brand new XL1s and to my suprise the GL2 looked identical and was sharper. I also noticed that the XL1s was constantly hunting for focus were the GL2 was realy quick at finding the focus areas in low light. I was really considering purchasing an XL1s but after that night and looking at the video side by side I purchased another GL2 for my B camera! Another great thing is that all the menu's and all most all of the ******** from the XL1s are on the GL2 .ie variable cotrol zoom's on the grip and handle. The only thing I don't like is the size I am more comfortable with the XL1S for doing free standing shooting but for alot of people that will be a plus. This camera rocks!. 

$$;
Summary:. Unless XM2 is different from GL2 this camera's pictures are better and more natural than with VX2000. My sister got one and i prefer XM2. So I am astonisshed with some comments.. 

$$;
Summary:. After having a Sony DCR-TRV20 for 2 years, and never had the ability to shoot video without noise, on a cloudy day, or in the evening, I decided to buy something better. The XM2 (european version of GL2) is much better. In the evening I get almost no noise, and always a nice and sharp picture. Also the TRV20 had a lot of smearing, and lens flares, thanks to the amazing JUNK Carl Zeiss lens. The lens is nice for some people, but produces a lot of smearing, and lens flares, with the flurite lens of the XM2 it's gone!. If you want a camera, that produces a normal clean video, instead of a grainy and noise picture, try this one.. 

$$;
Summary:. Professional picture, zoom and stabiliser perfects. It is difficult to do better! I feel happy!. 

$$;
Summary:. My first video camera was a Canon VC-20, backpack and all. My new Sony VAIO laptop had me leaning towards the Sony's VX-2000. They are priced the same, so after checking them both out online and at the stores, I went with the Canon. My Christmas videos came out cryst al clear inside, at night, without any additional lighting. Audio was perfect. I am challenged trying to use the Firewire from the Canon to the Vaio. I am still plugging away trying to get Windows XP to recognize the camera. It could be the other USB ports in use. The Canon comes with a Firewire/USB connector. I should probably pull out a straight Firewire to Firewire connector. I do not think I'll return it for the Sony, even though I have two weeks to think about it.. 

$$;
Summary:. I just bought this camera, and it is amazing. I ran a test comparing it to my old top-of-the-line Digital 8 camera, and this camera beat the video quality by literally a million times.. 

$$;
Pros:. This camera is great for all kinds of applications, its lightweight, compact, and shoots awesome video and still shots.. 
Cons:. It is not cheap.. 
Summary:. The bottom line, this camera is great, i do suggest getting it used from http://ww.onequality.com so it is more affordable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tough, dependable, excellant image quality.. 
Cons:. Image stabilization lacks. On Board mic is very limited. 
Summary:. My wife and I shoot video documentaries in Third World locations for NGO's and have relied heavily on this camera because of its small size and wieght. I have exposed this camera to sand storms, mud, torential rains, etc. without a single failure. However, I get the unit cleaned at Canon after every trip as I do all my gear. It take care of it, it takes care of me. I added a nice, mid line shotgun mic to the mix and the audio is now A+. I would recomend this little gem to anyone shooting down and dirty, ENG style video and demands hardcore dependability.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pro L series lens,High quality sound from the internal microphone, a great student camera, progressive mode is awesome.. 
Cons:. Optional xlr adapter costs $150. 
Summary:. If you can't afford the dvx100, than get this excellent camera, no questions asked.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality with right lighting is amazing, handling is easy, very durable.. 
Cons:. small screen.. 
Summary:. I'm a prosumer camera man. I've shot weddings, seminars, concerts, you name it, with this camera. I have it for over 4 years and now, after all the abuse it went through by my partner, it still doing a good job. Picture quality is breath taking but you have to tweek it right. Good light and Good gain settings are very important. I've stepped on it by mistake and I'm over 250 pounds, it did do some demage but believe me compare to the weight and pressure I put it through damage was not equal to it. I still have this camera and I use it more to play DV Tapes becasue I damage the Zoom in when I stepped on it which didn't die right away, gradually in few years it gave up. I love this camera and can't wait to get my hands on Canon HD camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. great feature Set, easy to swith between Auto and manual settings, Was easy to learn.. 
Cons:. Still image is only 1.7 meg pix, Mic should be more directional,. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightweight and compact, yet very powerfull and full of features. Love it because you dont have all of the worthless on-chip video effects that some sony's come with. Have used the VX2000, DV300U, and XL1, and I must say, this is my favorite. I have a p. 
Cons:. Wish it had XLR attachment included, and supported 24P mode.. 

$$;
Pros:. broadcast quality,3ccd,manual audio controls,best camera i've used compare to sony vx 2000.. 
Cons:. weight kinda heavy, stock battery life is short.. 

$$;
Pros:. GREAT image quality, great controls (a bit overwhelming at first). Clear scan is a godsend when transfering 8mm to video. Amazing zoom lens!. 
Cons:. Onboard mic is above average however use of additonal shotgun mic reccomended (Azden SGM-X works great).. 

$$;
Summary:. Looked at VX2000 but did not want 2 year old technology. Plus reviews were very good for GL2. I'm using my GL2 to shoot Television Commercial. One of my first clients wanted to shoot against a white background. The GL2 handled it great, manual iris and in SAND AND SNOW MODE.. 

$$;
Summary:. What a difference! My old cam gave me nice souvenirs but now my souvenirs are great and I am proud off my GL2 pictures. Each week-end I take my GL2 and I feel pro!. 

$$;
Summary:. Outstanding Quality! We use ours for broadcast on a local cable-access station and for Industrial Development &#38; CofC work. I can't get enough of it. I use it for both A/V and DV work - unreal! If I had to complain, it would be in three areas. 1. Too light - I sometimes think that I am going to break it. 2. Auto-focus a little goofy in action shots or high-contrast. 3. AV out jack does not look sturdy. But, well worth the money! Great! Great! Great!. 

$$;
Summary:. Canon took the GL1 and addressed all its shortcomings while keeping the GL1's best features. I like the ergomonics of the GL2 much better. The picture is excellent. Overall, a great cam.. 

$$;
Pros:. Owned this camera for 4 years. Excellent low light picture quality. I use this camera to produce local town public educaiton goverment (PEG) TV programs. I am very pleased with the sharp crisp video output. Has external mic input port.. 
Cons:. Only issue I have is with the occasional horizontal bars appearing on my video. Those are dirty head symptoms. Heads are very sensitive to the different mixture of mini DV tapes lubricants. Mostly Horizontal bars will show up without prior warning,. 
Summary:. Don't mix the brands of the Mini DV tapes. Stick to a high quality brand to keep the heads clean from different Mini DV lubricants. Otherwise it is a great camera to use and produce tv quality PEG programs. Always test the video first, before starting the record function... play back a little of the test recording to check the dreaded horizontal bars do not show up...then proceed to capture great quality prictures. The Mini DV tapes are easy to transfer from the camera via firewire to the editing computer. So far, there are no problems in finding easy to use video editing programs, compared to AVCHD hard drive video cameras that require high end costlier video editing programs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Video. Most of my viewers think it is TV.. 
Cons:. Nothing major.. 

$$;
Pros:. If you are an independent filmmaker that has some film school training than this camera can be put to good use. I have managed to use several of the technics that I have learned to shoot scenes that are far better looking than others that have won film f. 
Cons:. There is no button on the camera to turn off the gain, which causes alot of noise (grain on the picture). Even after that, the picture gets a little grainy in low light, which really sets things back if you are into low key or high contrast lighting for. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image quality, 30fps progressive scan mode for a slightly more "film" look, lots to love about this camera and the look of its video.. 
Cons:. Really bad video head problem that sometimes shows up months or years later. Can cost around $300 to fix. From what I have read it is a problem with the whole Canon camera line, I had it with my little ZR40 also. Camera screws up video with horizontal lin. 

$$;
Pros:. The GL2 has amazing image quality and color reproduction. I have had the camera for two years and have used it to do many projects for school/commercial work. The camera also has a wealth of great features e.g. clear scan, array of manual controls for f-s. 
Cons:. Adjusting the hand strap to be comfortable can be a pain at first. The manual controls and menus have a learning curve that takes time to learn to navigate well. Wish the iris controls were part of the lens ring.. 

$$;
Pros:. Eease of use, small and easy to use. Stills are excellent for just being 1.7, Still need to know how good in the dark.... 
Cons:. It is to small, for a hobbiest videographer. Even with the stablizer, I myself get to shakey holding it for so long... I am getting a stablizer arm... hope this solves the problem... All in all I love it.... 

$$;
Pros:. Possibly the best feature of the camera is the flexibility of control you have over the video/audio settings. Zebra Pattern, Controlable shutter speeds, white balance, audio gain, color gain, sharpness, and some other settings. The overall picture quality. 
Cons:. Battery life with supported cell is only around 90-120 minutes.. 

$$;
Pros:. The optics are great!!! Close-up shots have superb resolution. I want a camera that I would feel like I would use and be happy with the capital outlay. I got it! A great camera...wonderful film and picture camera.. 
Cons:. Size...not as small as some of the newer models, but worth it. Buttons...takes a while getting use to operating it...but once you get use to the manual controls...can't be beat. Battery life stinks...get the larger battery.. 

$$;
Pros:. A long focal length (hence the long body), the small (1/4") CCDs (small can be good!!!), ability to add a tele-extender (I use 2x Kenko), and the gain booster (helps with tele-extender) are the main reasons GL1/2 excels at zooming in on distant wildlife.. 
Cons:. Like the GL1, only the remote control enables single frame advance. Unlike GL1: (1) autofocus can't be overridden by turning the focus dial. (2) Labels for FF, play, etc. aren't ON their buttons, so are confusing. (3) Lock lever cancels TV shutter set. 

$$;
Summary:. Great quality for $1000 cheaper than what the Sony has to offer. There are a couple of things I would change for the GL3. XLR connector under the camera -- not on the side, and a metal body.. 

$$;
Summary:. I've had the GL2 for a month now and it's awesome. The quality of the images is outstanding. And it's interesting how the test shots I made on the superior chip sized Sony VX-2000 were no match for the smaller chip GL2. This is one time where size is really no indicator of quality. The Sony should have blasted the GL2 off the map with its larger chips. The GL2 also simply handles better and once you get used to the menu it's very easy to set up. Manual focus is easy and adjusting aperture is just a flip of a switch away.. 

$$;
Summary:. This is a great camera for sure. There may be other cameras that are even better, or may suit your needs better, so why vote thumbs down on it? That just doesn't make sense. If you liked the camera but like another one even more, then why give this one a negative rating? Why not give them both positive and explain you like the other one better?. 

$$;
Summary:. Low-light shots are amazing, even without changing the shutter speed. Using the manual shutter &#38; iris settings you can keep a steady 30 FPS AND pick up lots of color and detail, even in a very dark room. It doesn't use nightshot so your low light images won't be all green, but it also can't see pitch black either. The camera controls don't seem to be as bad as people say. And the frame mode doesn't seem to be as cool as people say. It does make my videos look more professional, but not really like I'm watching a movie. Maybe if I wide-screened it and used FRAME mode it might give it a movie-like effect. It's hard to tell how BIG this is from online photos and most places in town don't sell cameras this good. I will tell you that your normal camera bag will not fit this camera (lenght-wise) with the sunguard attached, which you will want to keep attached most of the time. I purchased a longer bag from a camera specialty shop and you will probably want to as well. Basically, take the Sony Handicam and make it a little longer and a little bigger and you have the Canon GL2. Don't be put off by the size though, it's not too heavy and the LARGER lens (yes, this has a larger lens than most consumer camcorders), 20X optical zoom, and 3CCD colorful image quality makes it all worth it! Another GEM from Canon!. 

$$;
Summary:. Recipe for success in the GL2: 20x optical zoom L-series pro lens, 410k pixels/CCD with pixel shift, excellent mic, no hot pixels on my GL2's CCDs, low-light is great, this thing see better in low light than me, and build quality that inspires one to use and use it for years to come. And, video and audio results that will hold up to your satisfaction for a long time. Why mess around with the average palmcorder for 1500 bucks? Get one of these.. 

$$;
Summary:. The quality on this 3CCD is just remarkable. It was a tough call between this and the VX2000, but now that I have it, I say it's the best. The VX2000 is great, I've used it a lot. Side-by-side, the picture quality on this little guy packs a punch. Movie mode just stuns my friends and family. Everyone wants the feature, although you can probably do it in post on FCP. I highly recommend this. It can get a little front-heavy w/ the Canon wideangle lens and shotgun mics attached. Video-direct.com is great; forget buying from NY. Videodirect is an authorized dealer. Call them for a great price, no joke.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good quality, nice lens, decent features. 
Cons:. No XLR connection, no interchangable lens', too small, difficult to do handheld stedy shots without a steadycam. 

$$;
Pros:. i purchased this camera about 3 years ago and i use it every now and then defitnetly not heavy use, i however have recorded great moments on several ocacions, i don't know about much of the features, i simpy put the tape in and record.. 
Cons:. video quality is very good in good ligth, i find it easy to use as the years have gone by i have gotten use to the desing and manage it better i like the handle to be able to record low to the ground if you have little kids this is a good feature.. 
Summary:. here is the major problem since i purchase the camera i experience problems transfering video into my pc, i have done it on several ocacions but never with out problems, i recently found out from a service website that this is more likely to be my dv board and that i need to replace it, replacing it would cost over $1000.00 i don't know about you but i think this a major fault since like i said before i have not use the camera on a daily basis by any means, the use has not been extreme and care has always being practice with this camera. the picture is not great in low light.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just remeber that canon makes the best lens. Sony uses there lens for the professinal cameras. Gl1 and the gl2 are great cameras.. 
Cons:. None. 

$$;
Summary:. Just picked up a GL2 after tons of research. Got it for $2249 at B&#38;H. I was comparing with the Sony vx2000 and the trv950. The 950 is no comparison, but the vx2000 was great also. I couldn't tell the difference in video quality. I was testing both in B&#38;H for about hours. The only reason I chose the GL2 was because it was a little smaller and lighter. THE VIDEO QUALITY IS GREAT IN LOW LIGHT. I am very impressed with this camcorder because I had lower end cams in the past. This is my first 3ccd cam and I tell you this, I will never go back to 1ccd cams. I was also looking at the new panasonic 24p because it shoots video like film quality. I am extermemly happy with the cannon and I recommend going to B&#38;H to test it out. You can test it out as much as you want. There is so many things that I need to learn about this camera and I am going to just flip it into FULL manual mode and start shooting. I want to learn. The cannon has a bigger zoom and it was lighter that's why I chose it.. 

$$;
Summary:. I read numerous online reviews regarding the Canon GL2 and Sony VX-2000, and the Canon GL2 seems like the winner in this close race. After owning the GL2 for a week, I was so disappointed with the low-light performance and digital still feature that I returned the GL2 and bought a Sony VX-2000 instead. After using the Sony for a week also, I am glad I did. In my opinion, the Sony VX-2000 wins between the two. Don't get me wrong, the GL2 is one sweet camera, but I feel that since the pricepoint of the GL2 is nearly identical to the VX-2000 which has much better low-light performance, the canon was just not for me. (I do a lot of low-light shooting on Halloween each year, and this was a feature of paramount concern). On the whole, I found that in a normal house at night with typical lamp lighting the Canon GL2 had to be full open on apature and +18db gain to achieve good exposure. This produced considerable picture noise. In contrast, the Sony VX-2000 can handle the same scene at full open apeture with no gain. This is due to 1/3" CCDs like you would find in Canon's much more expensive XL1. Here are the GL2s advantages vs VX-2000: === -Better optics (better color due to flourite, 20:1 vs. 12:1) -pixel shift combined with higher pixel count on CCDs seems to offer a bit more clarity, but this is arguable. (GL2 410,000 pixels/VX-2000 380,000 pixels) -Lighter weight, slightly smaller helps long hand held shooting. -30 fps progressive scan (Sony only offers 15fps progressive scan, shame on them) GL2s disadvantages vs VX-2000: -smaller CCDs (1/4" vs 1/3") which mean much more video grain in low light -more plastic-y feel, Sony is more metal-ish, robust feeling. -tape eject/transport on Sony seems more robust (I have no data on this, just casual observation) -control layout seems more ergonomic, less fumbling while recording. -manual zoom ring! All in all, I feel that the GL2 has better features, one cannot deny the superior better optics Canon has provided. If you plan on always shooting daylight footage, or using feature film style lighting, the GL2 is your cam. However, the 1/3" CCDs the Sony VX-2000 offers made the grade for me. I do shooting at night, and do not want to have to resort to sun-guns. For me, what good is an extra 200 mils on the lens (35mm conversion) if the picture is full of gain noise? I hope this helps others purchase the correct camera for them! Remove "antispam" from my email address to drop me a line.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Camera - Produces amazing video quality. I absolutely love this camera. That is untill...... 
Cons:. It stopped working. I have to send it back to Canon to get it repaired - it's just under the one year warranty because when I put in a tape it only says Remove The Cassette - doesn't work.. 

$$;
Summary:. An ok camera, just not what I expected. I own a Sony VX2000 and PD-150 we use in video production of homes for sale. We bought the GL2 because of the fact it was about a half pound lighter and a little smaller than the Sony cameras. The first problem is when you attache the small 3 watt Canon light, the drain on the battery is too great and shuts down the camer before the battery is one half way drained. Even with the biggest battery that Canon makes the battery life is short with their fill light. The second problem was when the telephoto zoom button failed after 70 minutes of use, making the auto zoom function useless. Now I must send the camera back to Canon only after 20 days of use. The mail order place would only take it back within 15 days. The third problem is the low light noise is a little worse on the camera when compared to the Sony VX2000 or Sony PD-150. It is not a big difference, but it is noticeable. I never had a reason to mail in a Sony camera for repairs, even after years of use. It's a dissapointment to have a new camera fail in so many ways.. 

$$;
Summary:. Would be a nice camcorder if not for the red push. If you like pink skin tones get one. If you prefer true skin tones, Opt for the VX2000, or if your very lucky, a GL1. The GL2 is a disappointment.. 

$$;
Summary:. We recently upgraded from GL1's to the GL2's. In just a few months the autozoom has stopped on both. We're waiting on Canon for response. Other than that they have met our expectations. However, I'm leary now about recommending anyone to try it. We've gone back to the reliable GL1.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome video and easy to use once you read the manual.. 
Cons:. Major issue with tape deck getting stuck and not ejecting the tape. Not good when you are shooting a wedding and you can not change tapes. There are ton of similar complaints online and Canon has not addressed it as of yet.. 
Summary:. Although this camera has superb video and ease of use I can not recommend it at this time. If Canon could fix the issue with the tape deck getting stuck I would highly recommend this camera and actually buy a few more.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Video Quality. 
Cons:. Doesn't Work - The Tape Feeding Carriage Eats EVERY TAPE. 
Summary:. I bought this camera to take to Italy on vacation. It worked great for a while. I must have taken about 40 tapes, when all of the sudden it decided to spit a constant "EJECT" message at me as soon as I put a new tape in it. It was followed by a "REMOVE CASSETTE TAPE" message. I cleaned it, and when that did nothing, Tempe Camera in Arizona sold me a cleaning tape. When I inquired about the problem, it was obviously nothing new to them, and they made it sound like it was time for a new camera. NOT! I googled it, and it appears this camera is FAMOUS for this problem. I am going to contact Cannon, and if they do not remedy the problem without complaint, I will pursue all available legal remedies. I just tried three new TDK tapes, and it IMMEDIATELY sent error messages and ate all three tapes. This camera was well cared for and was not abused.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great video in bright sunlight. 
Cons:. Poor low light video, horrible reliability. 
Summary:. I have used the GL2 to record kids' soccer games for a number of years, and I have had to have zoom rocker fixed on an average of once a year because of wandering zoom and button failure. Also, though the day light video is excellent, night games are washed out, brighter in the center than in the corners, and grainy.. 

$$;
Summary:. A camera for whomincremental video quality is worth an extra $1500---. Vivid color and sharp resolution. A bit heavy to handhold for a long time. Bulky and hard to pack, but the images are DVD quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. good video quality. 
Cons:. Mechanical failures, terrible service. 
Summary:. Infamous "remove cassette" problem: mechcanical failure.. Do yourself a favor and google "remove cassette" with "canon". You will find tons of messages about bad canon DV camcorders from ZR, Elura, to GL2 and XM2. Mine failed after about 50 hours of usage. This is apparently a design problem across all Canon models.. And the canon customer service is horrible..
