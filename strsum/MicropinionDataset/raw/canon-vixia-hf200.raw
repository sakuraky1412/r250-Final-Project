Pros:. Great HD pics in normal light - very light and easy to use - good zoom - well made - easy removal of SD card - fast focus and very close ups possible. 
Cons:. still pics should be in wide screen - low light performance not good, but then all small cameras are.. 
Summary:. I use it for a backup camera for weddings as I can keep it on my belt - small lenses and pickup sensors mean low light will never be up to bigger camcorders. In normal light the pictures are just as good though. The software supplied is best not used - do this:. 1. remove the SD card and plug it into your PC or Mac (may need a card reader). 2. copy the MTS files to your HDD. 3. use Ulead, Sony or Premiere - all the later versions will import the mts video/sound files. I use them with mpg2 HD files from my larger Sony HD camcorder.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. , No Moving parts. 
Cons:. NOTHING...not enough stars to rate it on 6 out of 5. 
Summary:. replace your old tape video camera and get one of these!!!!!!. You can get some good deals on this. 

$$;
Pros:. AMAZING picture quality! Did I mention AMAZING picture quality!!!. 
Cons:. Would've liked it to be touch screen but eh!. 
Summary:. Where do I start? The Ultra-Sleek, Compact and Lightweight Design. The Canon 15x HD Video Lens, 1920 x 1080 Full HD Recording, Canon Face Detection or the 24p Cinema Mode? I Love this Cam Head to Toe!. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb image quality in almost any condition.. rich color , not too much overexposed in daylight, feel like prosumer camcorder.. 
Cons:. a bit too much noise in low light, but its acceptable.. 
Summary:. Updated. on Dec 9, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality. 
Cons:. Picture quality isn't as great in low-light situations, microphone isn't the greatest (WIND). 
Summary:. I would definitely recommend this product. With good lighting (OUTDOORS), the picture quality is incredible. It's relatively light, and 15x zoom isn't amazing, but doesn't hold it back. Has plenty of settings to help you get what you want out of it. If you're willing to pay the price, you'll be happy with your purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. I just picked up my HF200 and I have to tell you, I was blown away. This camera is beautiful, the quality is amazing and I didn't spend thousands of dollars on it. It is the best buy if you're looking to upgrade to HD or already have an HD camera.. 
Cons:. The only bad thing I can say about this camera is that it didnt include internal memory, which in my opinion is not worth complaining about. You can buy an 8gig SD card for about $20.00.. 
Summary:. This camera is simply amazing. The picture quality you get from this camera makes you feel like you're filming a big budget motion picture and simple things around the house become amazing to look at. The camera is small and very easy to hold in your hand and the LCD screen is easy to navigate which makes the multiple pages of settings a no brainer. This camera also gives you three different framerate options which gives you very different feels to your filming. Basically what I'm saying is if you're looking to buy a new HD video camera...buy the Canon Vixia HF200. It's perfect for upgrading to HD and you're going to be able to do so much with this camera and not spend thousands of dollars. Although it doesn't include internal memory SDHC cards are easy to come by.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wide range of features. Great HD quality. SDHC card recording=almost no moving parts! (won't break easily). Small, and ergonomic. Good battery life. Built in lens protecting function!. 
Cons:. No viewfinder. Low light performance isn't amazing (noise can be prevalent). No built-in memory. 
Summary:. If you feel like you NEED extensive built-in memory, then go with it's sister, the HF20. However, I can't think of a better suited camcorder for the consumer who's looking for extensive features and AWESOME HD quality, all for a relatively low price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video quality and ease of use with provided software. 
Cons:. Camera itself seems pretty complicated out of the box. 
Summary:. I purchased a Sony Handycam SD camera before this one. I thought the resolution was horrible and was very displeased at the fact that older VHS videos had better quality than the final product of the Sony Handycam. I returned the Handycam and did thorough research prior to buying another camcorder. I was sold on Canon's great reputation and just had to decide on which camcorder was best for my needs.. I recently had a child and wanted a camera which was a versatile as my needs. I decided to go with this camcorder because of the high reviews and the lightweight of the camera. I purchased it in a kit at Costco for $569. Plenty of power and features for me. I love the quality and with a little toying around, the features become easier to use. A few things one should know.... When reading the reviews regarding Pixela (the included software program), I noticed that people had problems with it. I have a Sony Vaio laptop which is about 3 years old. Though a bit slow, it gets the job done. To break it down, this is the process to download load the program and then to websites to share with the world.. 1. Download the software to the computer. 2. Shoot a test video. 3. connect the camera via the USB cord (provided). 4. Once connected to your computer, press the button on the lower right hand side of the LCD screen on the camcorder.. 5. Select the option to connect to computer on LCD screen.. 6. Once selected, the Pixela program will open and transfer videos from your card to the Pixela library.. 7. From the library, you can either burn Blu-Ray copies, edit, or select file and export the videos to a place where you can get to them to upload to the internet. I did this and the video is great for all to see, including my out-of-state family.. This is how far I got and I just received the camcorder yesterday. Once I master the other features, I will update some more. Bottom line, don't be intimidated by the reviews of the software, this is a great camera which will last for years.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image quality ... easy to use menus ... well made ... small size ... great macro ... its delicious !. 
Cons:. Only yechhhhhh is that the lcd is not 100% accurate ... more like 95% to 97% which at times is a pain but all in all a wonderful buy !. 
Summary:. Simple to get wonderful results .... 

$$;
Pros:. Decent Camera amazing picture quality.. 
Cons:. Affraid it might break. Too expensive however I got mine for $700. 
Summary:. Very good pro. quality. Mediumish price. Acceptable for people filming projects. Overkill for home movies.. 

$$;
Pros:. It arrived overnight. I was impressed at how quickly my order was processed by Fumfie.com. The price was great only $545 before shipping and handling of course. Will definitely use this company again.. 
Cons:. I'm really bad at comprehension so it will take me awhile to figure the camera out.I would like to just pick the camera up and start shooting but there is a bit to learn before that happens.. 
Summary:. I have not had time to really use the camera but I am impressed at how small and light weight it is.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Canon picture quality is excellent. Controls intuitive. Works decently in low light. I particularly liked the 15x zoom. Beats Sony SR47 60x because image starts out in HD. (1080 to 540@30x : SD is 480). Superior image stabilization.. 
Cons:. I would like to have an optional "write to usb" to send the movie directly into a pocket portable hard drive running off the camera battery. Better low light would be nice. Stand alone software HD movie player wouldn't show green and is useless.. 
Summary:. I found the picture quality to be perfect to my untrained eye. Absolutely beautiful. The 15x zoom surprised me ... it was superior to the Sony SR47 (SD) that I purchased at Fry's and took back for store credit and upgraded to HD. Even at 60x digital zoom, the image stabilization was better than the Sony SR47 optical.. I zoomed in to 60x on a tv relay tower and could hold the zoom stable enough to count the cables on the receivers at a couple hundred yards. For someone used to SD, zooming in to 15x on some tree or flower in HD causes one to "tear up". It's just that beautiful.. Stereo sound was fine though not 5:1 Dolby.. You could do better if you upped the price to $1200 but the picture quality couldn't be improved at all. It doesn't get any better. I had a Panasonic SD9 HD camera in 2008 and took it back dissatisfied with picture quality and ate the $75 restocking fee. I won't be taking back the Canon HF200.. Though it lacks some features I'd like to have, I'm unwilling to pay much more for them. This Canon fulfills my minimum expectations perfectly and exceeds them by far in picture quality, zoom and image stabilization.. If you want a great HD picture quality at the lowest price ... this will fill the bill. And ... if you pay $8,000.00 for a professional HD rig ... it still won't give you better picture quality. Significantly better picture quality isn't offered on this planet (maybe you could get 1% better for 8g's). However, you can and will get 40% worse picture quality for about $200 dollars less.. One downside to HD cameras in general is the "hidden" cost of ownership. I now need a new computer ... my 5 year old HP can't quite handle the processing load required by HD files. And ... now my 720p Sony rear projection TV is inadequate for 1080p ... so ... I have to buy a new super duper LCD TV.. Well, I'd have to get them anyway sometime.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just got delivery of my new Vixia HF 200, I will offer my first glance thoughts.. She's tiny (great), she's easy to navigate (great), the picture quality in normal house-hold-cloudy-day lighting is amazing (great), intuative (great).. 
Cons:. The software is less then expected, in all catagories. (not great), It will be unistalled.. 
Summary:. I purchased this camera at Dell Canada for $699 Can. now on for $10 less. That is a great deal after shopping around. Love the SDHC flash card method, and purchased a 16 and an 8 GB card. If fits in my jacket pocket!!! And my chubby fingers have no problems with the controls. WOW! More later after I have lived with the little darlin' for a month or so.. 

$$;
Pros:. This was my first camcorder.. After skimming the manual and navigating the functions for an hour or so, I was ready to shoot.. Makes outstanding videos.. Super compact and light.. Sound is good as long as it's not windy.. 
Cons:. Hard to get the memory card out. (I use a guitar pick). Record button too easy to push accidently. (I used 3- 1/16" thick, stick on rubber squares around the button to reduce the chance of unintended recording). Editing is not as easy as it should be.. 
Summary:. Because of the format, I think this camcorder will be around for a while and I hope my next computer will make editing easier than it is now.. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase I selected.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice picture quality in bright light.. Well made.. Easy to use.. Good pictures - 3.3 Mpix camera.. Quck change SDHC memory card.. Standard microphone connector. Intelligent shoe for light, zoom microphone etc.. High quality recordnings up to 24 Mb/s AVC.. 
Cons:. Three camcorders tested exhibited the same error: Loud buzzing on the right channel of the earphone jack. Probably an error of the first production runs of the camcorder.. Automatic white balance bluish in overcast outdoors, yellowish indoors.. 
Summary:. Yes, I would do the purchase, once again. At least judging from what I know now. Of course, don't expect the quality you get from a Sony PMW-EX1 and the likes of it (USD 7000 upwards, sales taxes included) but it's very close under ideal light conditions and/or if you use the excellent manual overrides for white balance, exposure etc.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small. Light. few buttons. easy to use. great video in good light. good audio. brilliant screen. 
Cons:. not bad video in poor light but it really is no better than my $150 dv cam in poor light. few buttons means you have to scroll through a ton of thing until you find what you need. *.MTS file format...great quality not edit ready.. 
Summary:. *.MTS file format has amazing quality at a great file size but I wanted something that was ready to edit out of the camera...iMovie and Premiere Pro CS4 (CS4 only nothing before) will convert it but I moved away from DV tapes so I did not have the real time upload...the conversion is almost real time, some times longer.. For the price I would wait until it drops...I would feel like I am getting a deal at $400 but feel a little unsatisfied at $600.. But it is still am amazing camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture for it's class. Good stereo mic. Has some semi-professional features.. 
Cons:. Button presses can be heard through the internal mic. Slow to adjust settings on the fly. Video codec can be a pain to edit.. 
Summary:. I'd recommend this camera to the micro-budget filmmaker. I'm not sure if I can post a link here, but here's a 7 minute documentary I shot with it. It was mostly indoors and with low light:. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BXWweyjJZs. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use. The dual mode is very nice. No touch screen, all functions work from a joystick and minimal buttons. Very light and small. Picture is fantastic. Image stabilizer is awesome.. 
Cons:. A little tough to reach the thumb roller to change functions from camera to vidcamera. not a big deal. The software is a little bit cumbersome to transfer from the camera to computer.. 
Summary:. Overall this was a great purchase. It was a gift for my wife and we had been shopping for cameras for 12-18 months. This has all of the features that a couple with young kids needs in terms of zoom, speed, size, ease of use. Having a fully flash memory camera is a must for us because of the ease of having many 16 Gig cards with us. the battery life is plentiful and all of the functions are there for a reason and work well. There are a lot of other cameras out there that have some similarities in features but none of them put together the whole package quite as well as Cannon does on this one. Great Job Cannon.. 

$$;
Pros:. small. hdmi. 
Cons:. if user movers camera around while recording quality is pathetic...good otherwise. 
Summary:. for the cost of it was expecting something better fromn canon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp, vivid photos. 
Cons:. Complex, not easy to burn DVDs. 
Summary:. No one should buy this camera without completely understanding its format. You will be disapointed. Hard to burn standard DVDs. You will find most of your friends will need a Blu ray or HD player. The DW-100 burner does not write to SD. Cannot burn DVDs from flash card, format for DVD-R only, so you are out of luck if your computer burner does not burn -R. I will have to buy a external burner now, to burn DVDs. Be sure you understand camera before buying.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good picture quality for stationary or slow moving subjects, menus easy to use once you get the hang of them.. 
Cons:. Terrible quality for recording moving subjects, cannot interface with PC unless power cord connected.. 
Summary:. I bought this camera based on expert reviews about the video quality and features for the price range. There were a number of user reviews complaining about poor quality for subjects in motion. I decided to try this camera, for the main puropose of motion recording. After fiddling with all the features and instruction booklet for about a week I decided to record a couple clips of fast moving objects, at the highest setting, and check out the quality. After transferring the clips the my PC, I played them back. The motion parts were awful. Anything moving was blurry. Hooked it up to an HDTV and same result. I should have listened to the complaints!! The camera was in the box to be returned within an hour.. The only other complaint I have is you need to connect the power cord to interface with a PC in any way, no matter what the status of the battery is.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent - at outdoor. OK - Inside normal room light against light background..using inbuilt flash. 
Cons:. Not good -- Inside normal room light against light background..lots of noise. Very bad -- Inside normal room light against dark background..lots of noise..even with built in flush.. I compared against Sony TRV18E minidv I have.... 
Summary:. Not good if you mostly shoot inddor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Poor indoor light quality of picture. 
Cons:. in process of exploring. 

$$;
Pros:. Highly spec'ed, high functionality, decent build quality. 
Cons:. NOT Reliable. Low light image quality poor. 
Summary:. Failed on critical recording during one time event. Buffer overflow message and HF200 locked up till battery exhausted. No files or data on card, totally corrupted. If it was old type with tape, video would be there up to point of failure. So much for new technology..
