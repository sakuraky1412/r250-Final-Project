we primarily bought this camera for high image quality and excellent video capability without paying the price for a dslr  .
it has excelled in what we expected of it , and consequently represented excellent value for me , a digital camera needs three key attributes   1) ease of use ; 2) high image quality and ; 3) versatility for a range of situations  .
the powershot sx1 is does well against all these criteria .
all my friends want my camera for their vacations  .
i would recommend this camera to anybody  .
definitely worth the price  .
plus , when you buy some accessories , it becomes even more powerful  .
i am a dslr user but i find myself using the sx1 more than my dslr because it is so simple to use  .
for my use this camera might be the only one i'll need in the future .
too bad , it looked like it would have been a great gift for my wife .
as a fairly serious amateur photographer , this camera is what i have with me when i do not have my eos 5d  .
i bought it mostly for stills , planning to use t only occasionally for videos , but having a great video camera built in has allowed me capture wonderful moments that i was not expecting to  .
i shoot stills only in raw , and wish adobe camera raw would finnaly support this camera  .
the next update probably will .
i bought this camera about one month ago at buydig  .
com before costco had it in stock  .
i extensively researched and checked all other website reviews  .
this camera is rated at or near the top for superzooms everywhere i looked  .
i have had a few other digital cameras prior to this one , and by far this camera blows away the others  .
outside in daylight the pictures are crisp , sharp , and colorful  .
once in a while the focus is off , but you can usually see that before taking the picture , and re    focus  .
i really put this camera to the test when i took pictures at the paul mccartney concert at citi    field at night  .
from about two hundred yards away , in the low light , using a combination of manual and pre set settings , i is able to take over a hundred pictures that were nothing short of amazing  .
the 20x zoom is phenomenal  .
when i printed some of my pictures and cropped them , i is able to see the bands faces close up as if i were sitting in the first few rows  .
i tried not to use over iso 400 as most of the reviews discussed at higher iso  .
s the pictures become a little to grainy  .
i will agree with that review  .
but if i is able to take the pictures at this concert at iso 400 and under and get the results i did , i don  .
t see that being a problem  .
the amount of manual control you have with this camera is tremendous , and at the same time you can put it in auto and  .
point and shoot  .
and another thing , last year i spent one thousand dollars on a sony hard drive hd video camera with six megapixel photo capability  .
after seeing the video (hd and regular) this camera can take , i will be putting my video up for sale on craig  .
s list in the near future  .
no more carrying two cameras around anymore  .
oh and did i mention that while you are taking a video , if you happen to see a must have picture , you can take a still picture at the same time as the video is running  .
wow  .
before this purchase i is thinking of getting a digital slr , but after reading the reviews and now seeing for myself what this camera is capable of , i cannot see why anyone other than a true professional photographer , would need any other camera but this one .
while perhaps it offers slightly lesser performance than dslr , its features make it a high    utility camera  .
definitely a must    have tool for sightseeing , tour photography .
all    in    one hd 10mp 20x spectacular clear , fast camera by canon usa  .
in brief , 4  .
5 stars given    canon should listen much more from users  .
+/    us$ 500 for this nice camera is worth  .

good price for the feature set  .
although bulky it's half the size and weight of my d90 18    200 zoom so can go places where the dslr cannot .
settings are very easy and clear comparing to many other digital cameras  .
i've been anti    canon for long time  .
i is wrong  .
i used to have sony before this one  .
this is my best    ever    purchase to change to canon  .
price , quality , functions all happily married  .
highly recommended .
i own the powershot sx100 is and the canon hv10  .
so , does this make the sx1 is my dream camera  .
a 20x zoom on a 10mp/1080p hdv camera is exactly what an enthusiast photographer/ video editor like myself could use  .
but       is the sx1's full optical zoom active while filming video  .
if yes , then it's exactly what i'm looking for  .
i know my sx100is does not zoom optically while filming jpeg  .
so long as i have access to the full range of optical zoom while filming video , i am satisfied that this will be my next camera  .
can anyone verify this  .
thanks  .

great all    round camera , if a tad on the expensive side  .
having to order the mini hdmi online is a bit of a pain  .
overall , a great camera for those who do not want the size and weight of a dslr , and who have a use for the enormous zoom potential of this camera  .
i am glad i bought the camera  .
i recently purchased hti camera for an upcoming jamaica trip  .
i've always been a canon guy  .
i owned the old ae    1 and i owned an sx1 , which is an earlier version of this this model  .
i also own a canon , delphi , which i carry in my brief case for work purposes  .
ii trust the canon name and afer this purchase , i continue to trust canon  .
the camera is currently only available at specific small camera shops that canon is allowing to carry  .
best buy and some of the larger electronic stores do not have it as of the time of this writing  .
at $599 , you're right there within the price range of some dslr's  .
what hooked me is trhe hd video capability  .
i suggest you read the many reviews on the sx1 is and possibly go to canon's website to find a dealer who has it in stock  .
before buying , go pay them a visit and test it .
want some quick killer hd video then this is and camera for you  .
if you are looking for excellent image quality you will be disappointed  .
i hate shooting in auto mode but with this camera you basically have to to get a good image .

where is our sx20 review  .
i returned my camera to the vendor as i will not tolerate a sub standard product that is a known issue especially from canon who will not admt the sx1 is needs to be removed from the shelf due to failing parts updated  .
on aug 12 , 2009  .
due to the constant need for repair , i would never recommend this product  .
until now , i have always used canon cameras  .
never again  .
not heavy, very compact size. Unbeatable price.; Opening digital / HDMI small cover. Too small for me.
1080P HDV, CMOS , 20X zoom, 4fps capture.; High data use, is full zoom active while filming?
Lots of manual controls, RAW, Fantastic Videos; Should try not to use ISO over 400 if possible, gets a little grainy.
HD video recording, Powerful lens (wide angle to zoom) and runs off AA batteries, which are easy to find.; Very pricey . . .
This camera does everything: click auto or go deep into its broad menu, including face detection, raw, hd video, image stabilizer, custom, hot shoe, 80x total zoom (crazy and pure focused) WOW!!! and much more! Lightning fast at all aspects!; NONE......................
Sx20 Appears to bridge the gap from the Sx10 and SX1.; Lori Grunin. Where is our SX20 Review?
Nice HD video, that is about all.; POOR still images all modes. Canon is still selling this camera with flaws as many CMOS drivers have failed on a brand new camera.
What I like:. 1) The ability to adjust factors such as shuttle, aperture, ISO, exposure etc. 2) The powerful zoom feature. 3) The AA batteries.. 4) The vari-angle display. 5) The powerful zoom. 6) The HD video with ability to take image shot concurrently; 1) So far none.
Long zoom; excellent image quality; great video quality; lots of versatility in how it can be used.; As heavy as an SLR but without the flexibility to change lenses
The zoom is fantastic, 1080p video very sharp, nice size, great battery life.; Video sound is only ok, no pause for the video
20X with IS, Full HD res., CMOS, 2.8" LCD screen, image quality is great + RAW capable, IS function works well, f/2.8-5.7 max, nicely built; + AA batteries (even no rechargeable batteries included, just one-time use ones). + No HDMI cable provided. + Raw not available in 16:9 image
Beautiful design, large grip, articulating screen, great image and video quality, stereo microphones, heaps of wow factor, image stabilisation, 20x optical zoom and 2x digital zoom, vast array of settings. What's not to love about this camera.; Hmmmmmmm...NOTHING- it's just fantastic
Macro, Super Macro, HD video.; Image Quality isn't up to par but it is a Point &#38; Shoot. I guess I'm expecting too much from it. I have a Canon 5D and the images from that are outstanding but it also a DSLR.
Unfortunately, I have not had it long enough to find anything good about it. since purchase, it has had to go in 3 times for repair. Jammed control assembly, defective optical assembly, and don't know what the third repair will find; Defective from the beginning. In low light - inside, dusk, etc. takes very poor photos.
Incredible flexibility in tough shooting situations. Love the powerful zoom combined with great image stabilization, for both stills and video; Would like a manual zoom. The power zoom controls aren't sensitive enough, especially when I want to zoom slowly or just a little bit. Also, image is unexpectedly coarse at even moderately high ISOs.
It looked perfect for my wife but when I wnet to check on a major NY Camera Store's website they say many versions of the Power Shot including this one is discontinued?; I'd hate to get stuck with a camera that must be discontinued so soon.. I know this NY Camera store has a great reputation so how can this go from a Cnet review of very good to discontinued a few months later?
Great HD movies. Nice, crisp photographs below 100 iso, and a fantastic zoom! Having so much in one package is very nice. Also the SDHC cards are common and not too expensive. A lot of very nice features.; Controls a little confusing. Video mode swallows SD cards quickly. Battery indicator is not much good until the camera is about to literally die. Poor low-light performance. Kind of expensive when you can buy a pretty nice DSLR for a similar price.
