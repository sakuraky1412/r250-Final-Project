the sopa lodge is a good choice to stay with an amazing view over the crater - still , if you can find a smaller lodge , or maybe a tented camp in the area , i would go for that .
the lodge is big - a little to big for what i prefer - it makes it a little less personal than the tented camp we also stayed in during our safari .
it was chilling in the evening and we were very happy to find hot water bottles in our bed coming back to our room after dinner .
the dinner was very good and the buffet had a great selection for warm and cold food and for desserts .
both dinner and breakfast is served buffet style in a nice restaurant with great view over the crater .
for our dinner , celebrating my birthday , we wanted to have our driver/guide to join us , like he did on all the other places .
) as a surprise for my birthday the staff had made a cake and the ngorongoro sopa lodge choir sang and danced - very emotional - asante sana .
when the sun is going down over the crater it was so quite at the rim - i guess we all just needed time to soak it all in. .
had a nice welcome with some fruit juice - very good after a day in the crater .
had a good breakfast with a great view over the crater before continuing our safari .
