i purchased this in november 2009 and have enjoyed its usefulness for almost a year  .
i purchased the panasonic 65 inch viera plasma simultaneously  .
went with the samsung strictly for the netflix  .
forget the wifi toggle  .
i simply plugged in the ethernet and have never looked back  .
the kids watch netflix movies instantly as daddy downloads them at my discretion  .
download times for a netflix movie is buffering in less than a minute and no pauses throughout  .
love pandora , sounds great over the klipsch and baby advent speakers  .
i could care less about the flip down door  .
they evidently cared more about sleek looks than one more step to get your dvd in the tray .
bought panasonic dmp bd    60    good picture and up    convert , but crashed on firmware upgrade  .
despite reviews , decided to replace the bd    60 with the bd    p1600 , and couldn't be more satisfied  .
up    convert better than the bd    60 , blu    ray quality superb , internet hookup no problem , do not need a roku box with to access to netflix , pandora and youtube  .
though i tend to be pretty critical of my purchases , cannot find any real faults with this product       highly recommend  .
its an awesome bluray player with amazing features , great picture , and very easy to use  .
get it  .
you'll love it .
samsung has hit the bull  .
s eye with the bd    p1600 blu    ray disc player  .
this is a power packed blu    ray player with features most blu    ray players are lacking like bd    live 2  .
0 and the ability to stream digital audio video content (netflix , pandora , blockbuster and youtube) into your home via the internet  .
the picture quality is also amazing and i believe this player outperforms anything near it  .
s price point .
this is my first blu ray player and it operates beautifully  .
very happy with the load times and general aesthetics of the front panel design .
replaced a sony bdp    s300 with the 1600  .
i'm very pleased with the picture quality and the speed of operation  .
netflix streaming is a great feature  .
some others have reported playback problems on certain discs but i've yet to encounter one that wo not play .
i must be one of the only ones who hasn't had a problem with this player  .
they really did not need the flip down design , and i love how it works with my samsung tv  .
i got the wireless dongle (only can use a samsung one) and the updates and streaming work fine  .
i think if i had a faster internet connection it'd be flawless .
i would highly recommend this product if 1  .
you dont mind wire laying on the ground / being traced to box away from your router or you dont mind shelling over $80 for a usb dongle  .
but other than the wireless thing i frickin love it .
works great  .
i noticed that many users reported problems right away  .
maybe samsung had some manufacturing issues that they fixed by the time i got mine  .
too bad you cannot get blu    ray streaming from netflix  .
i suppose it requires too much bandwidth  .
blu    ray is such a great picture and this player does what it's supposed to do   play blu    ray movies well  .
i hardwired the network and have had no problems with streaming netflix or pandora or youtube    great feature that is not offered on most other players  .
my only complaint is the proprietary dongle  .
maybe there is a good reason , technically for this , but you can get a wireless dongle a lot cheaper than samsung's  .
in a way it worked out well for me because it forced me to run cat 5 wire and get a faster , more stable connection  .
with a nice hdtv and blu    ray player , i'm ready to settle in for the future .
i is an early adopter of hd    dvd (i know , i know ) and is disappointed at the loss of the format war  .
it is a while before i decided to dive into the blu    ray format , however  .
it is this player's ability to stream via the internet that sealed the deal for me i have one (count 'em) blu    ray disc , as the lion's share of my time using this player is for streaming via netflix (primarily) or pandora the player's load time (especially when compared to hd    dvd players) is absolutely outstanding  .
it's nice not having to watch paint dry while media loads i actually like the hinged front panel , as my grandkids are now less likely to play with buttons and smear peanut butter on the player i highly recommend the bd    p1600  .
this is the best value out there for the money and samsung is committed to bringing more technologies to this player as the become available  .
already they have added blockbuster online  .
this is well worth it  .
do not forget to spring for a $4  .
95 usb memory stick as you will need it for the bdlive functionality  .
a 1gb does fine .
i bought this for $56 bucks at best buy  .
idiots that bought it for 200$ , it is an electronic device that will be obsolete in 6 months get the picture  .
seriously , the flip down bar in front is not a problem for those who really care get your maids to put in your movies  .
i saw one person say its a hazard because it gets to hot not like any hdtv with 4 million wires doesn't get hot or anything it does not get hot  .
then people give bad ratings because of the 90 day warranty and there product died on the 95th day for the last 10 years with the market of electronics going the way it is , its just as reliable as the gm making cars , they die and then make something cheaper the next year  .
its a good player that does the job , for those that overpaid , your idiots , and stop giving bad ratings because of minor defects that may or may not have an effect with the player .
i purchased a bd    p1590 from sam's club for approx $180 after getting researching on    line reviews and comparing to the bd    p1600 (about the same)  .
i connected to a samsung ln    t4669f 46 lcd via hdmi cable , but had difficulty with the allnet+ after trying for about 10min it finally connected  .
i loaded a regular dvd and during previews it froze  .
removed and tried again but this time it couldn't read the disk  .
the display read close  .
i called customer service and they wanted me to send it back for repair  .
i decided to return for another unit figuring if the second one is bad , i'll try a different brand  .
no problem with the exchange from sam's club the second unit connected immediately without any problems whatsoever  .
the initial screen listed all 4 options ; blu ray , netflix , pandora youtube  .
(the first unit only showed netflix pandora)  .
i then inserted a regular dvd (same as before    across the universe)  .
the previews ran perfectly and the movie played flawlessly  .
i then played with it by stopping , ejecting , resuming searching , etc  .
with no problems  .
i tried another movie , again no problems  .
powered off unit and it immediately switched to the tv as it is supposed to  .
a few days later we watched a bluray movie , night of the museum  .
it is superb , absolutely the way it is intended to be viewed , clear , precise , enjoyable  .
actually it is unbelievably perfect  .
i am very satisfied with this unit so far  .
i've had it for a few weeks and it's used practically everyday by my daughter who's a movie nut  .
she said it's definitely an improvement from our old dvd player i'm aware that samsung's customer service has many complaints by dissatified consumers but i preferred to get a samsung player to minimize the remote controls  .
however , now that i am familiar with the features of both tv and bluray player , both controls are somtimes needed because the disc player cannot control all of the features from the tv and vice versa  .
so don't plan to put away the tv control permanently  .
on that note , brand loyalty goes out the window which helps me decide on the complimenting audio system ; definitely not samsung it appears that the first player purchased is defective but the second (replacement) player is good  .
this happens , as i recently experienced the same problem with a bluetooth notebook mouse  .
i don't feel i've spent a lot of money for this player , comparatively speaking , so for my purposes it fits our needs and does what it's designed to do  .
i recommend this unit but if the first unit seems goofy or does not operate well , give it a 2nd chance  .
but be sure to purchase it from a place where you can return it .
i recommend this player to anybody who wants a very reliable  .
well built player .
the 1600 has a small foot print  .
it's a stripped down modle that left out all the extra stuff i do not need , never use and never will  .
but you can add them on later if you want  .
all around perfect bd for the price and features  .
if you use netflix this bd is a must have , plus if you like endless comercial free cystal clear music pandora is it .
i is a little hesitant about purchasing this player  .
after reading the reviews i felt i is taking a risk buying it  .
i purchased it with geek squad insurance and for $20 i felt a little better about the purchase  .
i set it up with an ethernet cable from my wireless router to bypass some of the problems people were having with wireless hookup  .
i also have not updated the firmware but will wait to see if all the bugs get worked out of the current firmware updates  .
the set up for netflix and pandora is easy and work great  .
any problems that i had is with the wireless router and not the player  .
i paid $149 for this player and for the price and what it does i feel like it is a good purchase .
good price , good features , a little concerned about some issues documented on the various forums  .
wished they would activate pc streaming  .
i hope this bottom line player continues to improve by firmware  .
solving issues by customers , i really like the features included with this player  .
go out shopping for similar good luck .
bought this a few days ago , with concerns about what other members said  .
however , it connected to the internet fine  .
non    tekkies who do not upgrade the firmware by usb before connecting to the net for the first time may have a problem  .
since i used flash usb it worked fine  .
my old dvd's play well , and new dvd's work fine also  .
netflix streaming works well , but interface is not as refined as on insignia  .
i had bought an insignia based on quality concerns of samsung , but had to return it as a few different machines refused to play my old dvds  .
samsung does not show same symptons  .
i did spend $20 for 2 year geek service on this unit , which seems well worth it after many negative quality reviews shown here  .
pandora works well  .
you tube on tv seems a waste of time , as input interface is poor my last samsung dvd player still worked , but i wanted netflix capability , and @ $120 plus geek $20 , i am happy with this player  .
the product is a great product , and i love that the remote works with my samsung tv  .
the image quality is crisp , clear , and concise  .
however , the firmware network updates do not always function well  .
the last couple of times i have had to update from the usb drive as wifi is slow to inoperable  .
while it will function off a wireless g router , i'd recommend upgrading to a wireless n router  .
the fact that it has a flip down face plate can be bothersome as you must have a usb stick plugged in to access all bd content and the second usb port in the back will most likely be occupied with the wifi adapter  .
however , you can purchase a usb hub and plug it into the back usb port  .
this will allow you to plug the wifi stick and memory stick off of one port  .
this makes for a much nicer appearance and an overall cleaner machine  .
i would not recommend it for people that are not computer savvy as firmware updates can be a pain the ass , and if done incorrectly will damage your unit  .
however , overall i'm quite satisfied with it .
i would really like to know if the cnet reviewer actually used this blu    ray player  .
his complaint is the flip down panel , this complaint is not even a real one  .
yes you can manual use your hand to flip the panel up and down  .
however you can use the remote and press the open/close button and the flip panel comes down as the disc drive comes out  .
after you place the move in the disc tray , you walk back to your sofa , press the open/close button and the disc tray goes back in , and the flip panel closes with it  .
i found this out the very first time i used it to play a movie , making the flip panel complaint to me ridiculous  .
i used to trust cnet reviews but when something this little is their biggest complaint when really there is nothing to complain about when it comes to that is just wow updated  .
on may 19 , 2009  .
i recommend this to all folks looking for a nice blu ray  .
with additional features like netflix and amazon streaming these players should stay at the forefront , propelling blu ray to stay alive and well (imo) .
make no mistake , samsung's p1600 blu    ray player is the best entry level player you will find on the market  .
the bells and whistles on the p1600 raises the bar on what a consumer should expect for under $300 features    .
samsung has stepped up to the plate and hit a home    run with the p1600  .
netflix movie streaming is an amazing technology and the content is growing every week  .
pandora is the best free music service on the planet  .
if you have never used it , you need to check it out  .
both features alone make this product difficult to compete with on a feature to feature basis  .
the only reason to purchase the p3600 is if you need wifi ready out of the box , analog 7  .
1 surround , and/or the 1gb memory for bd    live (profile 2  .
0) blu    ray video/audio impressions    .
since i bought this player i have enjoyed watching slumdog millionaire , indiana jones , and changeling in blu    ray format  .
all loaded quickly , the picture is amazing , the colors were vibrant , and the images were crisp and detailed  .
i have no complaints as for audio i have an older denon av receiver so i have found that running the audio bitstream (audiophile) setting works best for me  .
the standard bitstream setting lowered the audio quality to a dissatisfactory level of performance the standard bitstream setting allows for secondary audio playback , i  .
director's commentary but lowers the audio quality which is very noticeable dvd video/audio impressions  .
compared to my older panasonic dmp30 , the p1600 comes up short  .
dvd's do not look great but they are watchable  .
the colors are muted and it looks as if there is a film over the screen blurring the image  .
audio is great as well although i did notice some audio hick    ups when listening to audio through the hdmi cable connected to my television overall this is a great blu    ray player with great features  .
netflix and pandora features are great added value  .
if you are in the market for a blu    ray player for under $300 you will not find a better player .
great player for the price with it's extra features (netflix streaming)  .
i would recommend this for anyone looking for the bang for the buck .
when streaming any hd program that's available in hi    def through netflix , it's sharp and crisp  .
my room mate came in while i is watching heroes in hd and he said that it looked better than when he streamed it through his xbox 360  .
pandora is like tivo in the sense that it predicts what you want to hear after you enter in bands that you like online  .
granted it's sometimes wrong , but all you have to do it hit thumbs down and it'll stop play on that song never to be heard again and skip to the next one  .
the main reason you buy a blu    ray player however is it's blu    ray capabilities  .
as i learned with my last blu    ray player (a sony bdp    s560) not all players are created equal  .
it's blu    ray playback is so terrible i sold it  .
now i have this one and am absolutely pleased with it's playback  .
when watching star trek it looked like i is looking at the uss enterprise through a window  .
sharp  .
precise  .
spectacular cons   the dvd upconvert abilities are not as great however  .
not terrible , definitely watchable but not as good as a standalone upconvert dvd player  .
the youtube thing is neat but the letter entry is tiring , it's basically like writing a text message via your remote  .
(you have to press the number2 , 3 times to get the letter c  .
the front flap is not an issue at all  .
all in all this is a great player that i'd happily recommend to a friend .
(read further for where to find the wireless card for $30) i bought this blu    ray player for my parents on a whim while i is shopping at fry's  .
i is impressed by the features and especially it's wi    fi capability combined with netflix and pandora fast    forward to getting all the way home and opening the box to find that i needed a special usb wireless card from samsung that costs $80  .
bogus  .
not very happy about this as it is definitely not clear on the box or in the store  .
anyway , because i felt like sticking it to samsung for their devious ways i found a wireless card that uses the same chipset as the samsung one rosewill rnx    n1 ieee 802  .
11b/g/n usb2  .
0 dongle  .
model# rnx    n1  .
price   $30  .
i got mine at newegg and it works great  .
enjoy screw you samsung  .
bought first one , took it home had lots of difficulty getting it to play discs and there is an annoying pop from the audio about every 2 seconds when the unit is idle (disc inserted but stopped)  .
took it back to and exchanged for a second unit plays great , however , i still have the 2 second pop when stopped , seems like a design flaw if you get a great price and you like netflix , pretty nice box i'm worried that the audio pop problem will migrate from stopped mode to play mode .
first unit is defective firmware upgrades did nothing to fix the dvd from freezing 15 minutes in the movie  .
samsung seems to have a real quality issue with this unit acknowledge it and send customers a replacement unit  .
paid $279  .
99 plus tax not shelling out anymore money on defective model i have $39 dvd players that give me no problem  .
can not recommend this model and customer service is terrible and scripted  .
i is considering spending $100 for a ps3 w/ 80gb storage but the netflix streaming swayed me in this direction  .
i'm a bit disappointed that the wifi adapter is not available yet .
hooking up netflix is a nightmare  .
the box clearly says , on three sides , that you can receive pandora , netflix , blockbuster and youtube  .
for connection to these you have two options   1) hook a lan cable from your internet cable/ router to your television  .
since my internet is in a different room and i don't want to run a 20' cable down the hall , this option is shelved  .
2) use your internet wireless router for connection  .
now , my box states (somewhere on the side) that a wireless lan device is not included  .
that means that i would need to purchase one from samsung (there are no after market options here) for about $75  .
so if you have to go route #2 then plan on spending another $75 to make this work  .
and , after reading internet reviews of this $75 lan device , i have concluded that it's a piece of garbage  .
so , my next course of action is to bridge two wireless routers and run a lan cable from the second router to the player in conclusion ;  .
i am a lazy bastard  .
when i bought this device and i saw all that it could do i did not realize that i would have to do most of the work to make it happen  .
i will get this to work , but time is money and samsung is racking up the bills here my advice   buy something that is designed for lazy bastards (like my toaster) and has everything needed in the inside of the box to make everything listed on the outside of the box work  .
you'll like this bluray player  .
however , if you want to use the wireless hook up to netflix , be aware that the wireless dongle (linkstick) is not included and is a separate purchase i bought the linkstick for $82 plus $10 s h  .
had a difficult time connecting to my wirless network , intallation manual is useless , customer help line even more useless (the first tech i spoke to didn't even know this is a samsung product)  .
after 6 months , the linkstick stopped working  .
samsung tells me it has a 30 warranty and there is nothing they can do about it  .
30 days warranty on an $80 part  .
tells me samsung does not stand by their product .
there have to be better players out there  .
if i is to give someone advice about this unit , i would advise them to not purchase this unit  .
too many people are having problems with it including us  .
thankfully , ours is given to us with the purchase of the samsung 46 lcd  .
it seems as though a lot of companies are giving these players away with tvs    as if they know it's a peice of useless garbage  .
but , like i said , as long as it continues to play blueray movies , i'm not going to complain as it is free  .
i generally expect a product i pay $250  .
00 for to operate for longer than three months and if it does not i expect the company that provided it to provide a little more back up than 3 months  .
i understand i should have looked closer at the warranty however samsung has generally been better than that .
wireless adapter is not included and samsung makes you by their own proprietary one for more than you could get a generic n adapter the most aggravating thing about this player is how unresponsive the controls are  .
if you are fast forwarding and then press play to stop where you are and start playing the disc , the player keeps on fast forwarding for about an extra 3 minutes of the disc before stopping  .
this is even worse for netflix but at least that you can sort of understand since you are communicating with the netflix server (although , enough buffer space on the unit would fix this too)  .
this is a problem with both dvd and blu    ray recently , this unit started exhibiting all sorts of other weird behavior and so i did the samsung recommended firmware update  .
this actually made it worse  .
now i cannot operate any of the remote controls or get past the previews on any disc to play the movie samsung really needs to get it's act together before releasing a product this poor .
i am a fan of samsung tvs , but will not likely buy another samsung br dvd player  .
we contacted samsung and were told to update our software  .
i tried and the most current software is already running  .
i have tried several different disks of the same movie from netflix , and all have failed to play  .
older br dvd movies have not been a problem  .
the bottom line is that i would strongly recommend looking at another brand for br dvd players .
i have two identical bd    p1600's connected to two samsung televisions , one took the may 2010 firmware upgrade without incident , the second player locked up and became unusable after the firmware upgrade  .
it has since been returned to samsung for service  .
the player in question is only about 7 months old any device that permits firmware upgrades must have a hard reset  .
it is ludicrous that after a failed firmware upgrade one cannot reset the device oneself  .
instead it must be sent to an authorized samsung service facility for repair .
this player's hardware seems solid enough , but the firmware is simply not up to par  .
consumers should not be beta    testers , all movies should work out of the box  .
bluray technology has been out for a few years now so it should be better than this the bdp1600 came free with my samsung tv (which is great) , but i probably will not buy another samsung player based on these experiences  .
stick to their tvs .
started to get pixelation artefacts after 2 months of normal use  .
updated the firmware and the unit ran well for 3 days  .
got more pixalation and called customer support  .
the person i spoke to had no clue as to what i is talking about when describing the problem  .
i have to ship (no charge) the unit for repair  .
will take about a month  .
i will just buy a new different unit after reading the reviews this time updated  .
on nov 22 , 2009  .
picture and sound are great but cannot keep unit since it doesn't support playing dvd+r discs and i have over 50 slide shows (vacation photos for last seven years) written to dvd+r discs  .
did not get to try the netflix movie streaming but liked the clear instructions for making it work updated  .
on nov 16 , 2009  .
after it broke   perhaps my player never worked optimally even from the beginning , but it broke just outside the 30 day return period where i could've exchanged it at bestbuy  .
the unit's manufacture date is 03/2009 , and for the price of the unit i'm quite disappointed that it's already stopped playing disks  .
they never load , i've tried several different disks , waited 30 minutes for each  .
netflix feature doesn't work anymore , did not try pandora  .
samsung customer service is easy to get a hold of but i'm not happy with what they told me  .
without access to a cd burner , there are no trouble shooting options they can walk me through  .
their first and only option at this point is to send me a firmware upgrade disk in the mail that will probably arrive in 5    7 business days  .
this has to be tried before i can send it in for repair , unless i wish to just pay for the repair myself  .
i asked why i had to try the firmware upgrade disk first before sending it in , and is told that in their experience the firmware upgrade usually fixes the problem i'm having and it's a common issue  .
i stated that given the manufacture date of the product and when i purchased it , i feel that they should have a product recall instead of continuing to sell these units with a common defect that causes it to completely not work  .
i also explained that i just rented several dvds (dexter , season 3) to watch  .
apparently , there is no process where i can send them a receipt and be reimbursed for the money i'm out because the player will not be fixed before i have to return them  .
they cannot send me a gift certificate , or even a coupon off another samsung product like i would buy one , after this experience  .
for the price paid vs  .
how long it worked , this is the worst home electronics item i've ever bought .
i is perfectly happy with the player until the first one failed  .
i called customer support and they said the only option is to return it  .
i exchanged it at best buy , where i bought it , (thank you best buy for your easy exchange) , only to have the second player fail after allowing the firmware update  .
i wish samsung customer service had been as informative as the cnet customer reviews  .
i'll be sure to do my research here as i decide whether there is another model out there to buy after i return the samsung  .
i wo not be exchanging for another one with the same problem .
i purchased this player about a month ago when amazon is running the 4 blu    ray's and a samsung player for a big discount  .
picture quality and audio are great , when they work  .
i've had problems on several discs with audio lag and when the player found a firmware update over the network , i readily upgrading to it only to have the upgrade process kill the player  .
i've heard updating from usb does not have any issues even though i is a few days past my 30 day return , amazon is gracious enough to overnight me a new player , same model  .
i cant say enough about amazon's customer service , they are superb  .
i got the new player in and upgraded the firmware with a usb thumb drive this time and is successful , however the player continues to have a delay in the audio  .
just to be sure i connected the player to a tv using just a brand new 1  .
3b hdmi cable and bypassing my receiver , the audio delay continues  .
i hear no audio lag playing regular dvd's by the way out of curiosity , in case it might be the discs themselves , i purchased a panasonic blu    ray player from best buy  .
absolutely no audio lag , works perfect  .
although the operational speed of the panasonic player is not as fast as the samsung , i'd rather have audio the way it's supposed to be heard instead of watching a movie that looks like it's been dubbed over i do not know if this is a problem on all of these players or maybe a run of them came out bad , but i've had two bad so far and i'm about done with this model  .
the model up from this one has the same video processor so it might have the same issues  .
i'll give the player high marks for it's operational speed and slick interface , but the audio problems are a deal breaker for me  .
i would look elsewhere if i were you i just received a full refund from amazon on the second player but will probably just wait until an affordable player is released that operates fast and has no issues .
dont buy this system it is suppose to play dvd's and blue ray but only plays blue ray disk and if you want it fixed it will cost you  .
i have used my samsung dvd player for now to play dvd's but would like my bd    p1600 to play dvd's like it suppose to  .
why have a product that only does half of what is suppose to .
stopped playing bluray disks after 2 months  .
forced to send it back via fedex , waited a week before samsung fixed it , then it is sent back via snail mail  .
well over 3 weeks without a bluray/dvd player device worked for another 2 months and stopped working over same issue , 'cannot read this disk'  .
called samsung and they said to spray compressed air into player  .
silly me  .
still did not work  .
now , i'm supposed to send it back again via fedex except my warranty only covers 3 months labor with 1 year parts  .
this player is not even 6 months old and i'm spending some cash on repairs that should not be happening screw that , never get a samsung 'anything' again  .
their tech support is weak , their warranty bites , i'm getting a ps3 or some other brand that plays netflix and pandora  .
we should not have to spend 2 bills just to receive the cold shoulder  .
so irritated right now .
you can pay about $20 more for a player with the wireless adapter built    in and built    in storage  .
pass on this and save your allowance for the next best model .
my wife purchased this as a christmas present , and is attracted by the internet connectivity for netflix  .
after 5 hours of testing , configuring , retesting , and failing to find any reasonable solutions on samsungs utterly ridiculous support webpage , its going back in the box and back to amazon .
like many other reviews online , had isssues with the 1590  .
went through 2 of these units already  .
purchased at costco and worked for 4 months  .
then load on display and static lines on screen  .
samsung wanted $80 labor to fix  .
returned to costco , great return policy , and gave the unit another try  .
this unit lasted less than 1 week and is doing the same thing  .
going to return for a refund  .
really loved the pandora feature and samsung makes the only blu ray players that currently offers it .
didn't samsung used to be great  .
what's happened  .
(my 32 tv of theirs is fantastic) juddery video on all settings over 3 different tv's , especially bad on slow panning shots  .
freezes up regularly for about 20 seconds at a time , then resumes with no audio  .
boots up in monochrome requiring several re    starts  .
this has all been tested with pristine discs and a firware upgrade which i hoped would solve the issues a big disappointment from opening the box i am returning to debenhams for a full refund and getting myself an lg bd360 (i have not heard anthing bad , and have read 34 forum pages dedicated to it  .
although the cool features made me want to purchase this , the lack of tech support made me take it back  .
using pandora is not worth the possibility of losing the ability to play dvd+r discs  .
fix either the specs page or the owners manual whichever is incorrect , or provide competent tech support  .
worthless customer support simply implies that samsung does not care about it's customers .
if the machine would keep working , the included items such as netflix and pandora , as well as the video quality make it worthwile  .
when i returned the unit to the store (within 30 days of purchase) the sales person in the home theatre area said that many of these machines had been returned for the same reason  .
he recommended the lg machines (bd 370 or bd 390) or the sony machines  .
since i really enjoyed the netflix application , i went with the 370  .
picture quality isnt quite what the samsung is (barely noticeable though) but it works and has the netflix app .
don't buy , please do not buy  .
a gawdawful waste of time and money .
buy a different brand  .
after being disconnected multiple times , customer support spent maybe 2 minutes with me on the phone  .
they told me to update firmware , which i had already done  .
the only solution beyond this is to hold fast forward to reset the unit  .
this did nothing but clear all settings  .
after giving them the serial number the woman informed me i is in luck because the unit is still under warranty  .
she told me to go buy a box , wrap up the player , pay ups to ship the unit , then pay labor cost to repair it  .
i told her i originally paid $80 at best buy  .
she laughed and said well , it probably is not worth it then  .
what type of solution is that  .
spend more than buying a new one to fix a 4 month old unit  .
i am going to try to return it to best buy  .
if this does not work , i will be joining the class action law suit against samsung  .
it is simply unacceptable that the internet is filled with complaints about samsung's inability to fix their blu    ray issues  .
i would applaud them for just admitting they have no clue what they are doing  .
to think , i used to recommend their products fyi , i have a dvd player that tries to stream netflix for sale  .
$80  .
usb port did not work from the first time i tried it , which unfortunatley is a week after the 3 month warranty ran out  .
i should not have waited to check this function , but i dont use usb much on a player of this type  .
i only wanted to view some photos on a flash driver  .
i spoke to others who have had the same problem with this player  .
the player is only out of warranty for one week and samsung told me i would have to pay for the labor  .
i got the extended warrarnty on the player but that only covers parts  .
do you believe it  .
they want 130  .
00 to fix it and the thing only cost 150  .
00 samsung is really hitting it off with american consumers , including me , and thats why they have done well  .
treating the american consumer like i have been treated willl slowly change the atttiude of consumers towards them  .
samsung should issue a recall on this product and make good for it  .
they have made a defective product and should stand up to plate  .
are you listening samsung  .
just in case anyone else is having this issue , here is a copy of my chat transcript with samsung tech support (i hope this helps someone else having the same issue)    .
please wait for a samsung agent to respond you are now chatting with 'vail k'  .
vail k   hello , i am a samsung technical support representative  .
how may i assist you today  .
visitor   i have a bd/p 1600 blue ray player and trying to play ong bak 2 dvd , but it won't play visitor   i read a few forums stating that samsung is waiting for a new firmware to come out so that this movie can be played but no eta on when newer firmware will be out , is this correct  .
vail k   is it happening with all the discs  .
visitor   no , not all discs , all other discs work great visitor   just this one dvd , hence why i checked forums and seems that there may be other people who also experienced this and contacted samsung about it too vail k   is it the dvd disc or the blu    ray disc you are unable to play in the player  .
visitor   this ong bak 2 plays great on my sony blueray player but not my samsung visitor   all my discs are bluray  .
visitor   my firmware i have currently is bev  .
08_100319a_xaa  .
vail k   alright  .
did you try with the another disc of the same title ong bak  .
visitor   i don't have duplicate disks of ong bak and i don't have the first version visitor   i have 3 other samsung players all the same mdel for my home , and all have latest firmware and all cannot play it but my sony can play it correctly  .
vail k   reset the player and try to play the disc again and let me know the outcome visitor   ok , i can certainly do this one more time , but just so you know , i have done this several times already on all of my samsung blurays visitor   hold please while i do it yet once again vail k   sure , to reset your bd player , with the power on and with no disc in the player , press and hold the ff button on the front panel for five seconds  .
the language screen will appear and all settings will revert back to factory settings visitor   the forum i read about this issue with this dvd player said samsung had them do this as well , i tried this as well on my own already but still same issue only thing this does is having me to to reconnect all my subscriptions visitor   is there someone there you can ask about this issue with this 1 dvd  .
visitor   ok done visitor   is it a firmware issue  .
vail k   i can understand your concern , the issue might be due to the compatibility of the disc  .
we will forward this to our support department and they will update the firmware to resolve the issue visitor   should i put dvd back in  .
last time i did this it didn't work vail k   yes , please put the disc and play it again visitor   already did and still cannot play  .
visitor   i am putting another dvd in now and that is one is playing  .
visitor   so compatibility of the disc    samsung needs to come up with another updated firmware to be able to play this disc right  .
vail k   yes , that is right  .
we will forward this title to the support department  .
they will add this title to the queue and release the firmware visitor   is there a list of dvds that cannot be played by samsung blurays you can provide me  .
visitor   i do not want to buy more that fall on this list just to be disappointed yet again visitor   i wish i would have known this is going to be an issue since at this point its more trouble than its worth and would have not purchased samsung bluray player at all vail k   i am sorry , we do not have the information about the other titles  .
at present , only 2012 is the title which have this problem , we forwarded that to our support team visitor   so no eta on when firmware will be updated to be able to play this on my samsung player than  .
vail k   the firmware update may release in the month of april or may  .
we do not have the exact information about the date visitor   actually , i have 2012 and just put it in again and it does work there is no issue in watching this disc vail k   yes , only some players have the issue playing the 2012  .
your player may play this disc visitor   can you tell me what the policy to return these samsung bluray players that i purchased  .
at this point , i would rather return it since i consider these bluray players useless if i have to wait another 1    2 months to be able to watch a dvd i buy visitor   ironic that i have 4 total samsung players and none of them play my ong bak 2 disc visitor   but they all play my 2012 disc  .
vail k   i apologize for the inconvenience  .
samsung do not sell the products directly to the customers , it is only done by the retailers or the dealers  .
the return policy depends on the store you purchase  .
once the firmware is updated there will be no further issues .
don't waste your money on blu    ray discs if you have this blue ray player , they wo not play  .
i just purchased brothers and could neither skip nor fast forward through the previews and finally when i did get to the main menu , i could not even select to play the movie  .
my universal remote nor my blu    ray player remote would work  .
the only buttons active on either remote , were the open/close button and on off buttons  .
blah  .
low price + no use    poor value i purchased with hopes of streaming netflix only to find out i needed to purchase a separate samsung linkstick ($70+)  .
many hours of frustration with isp tech support and level 1 and 2 samsung support it is determined that my bd    p1600 needed to go to california for servicing  .
buyer beware and shop with a different manufacture .
i have a new player now , and it does not work properly many of the dvds and blu rays i have and rent , flat out , will not play  .
the one's i get to play do not play smoothly throughout , the pixelate and hangup and need to be fast forwarded or restarted  .
i am tired of dealing with samsung's customer service people , they are nice , but they are not responsive  .
as a customer , i should not have to constantly struggle with unplugging , rebooting , reconfiguring  .
i am giving up on this samsung bdp1600 player  .
i will be putting it in my next garage sale or craig's list .
i just bought this player , and is comparing the picture quality  .
i is very disappointed with the picture quality the dvds play better on my 4    years old lite on dvd player (with no upconversion) connected to the tv with rca cable , than this player connected with an hdmi cable i tried with multiple cables and multiple discs to make sure there were no issues with the cable and/or disc in every case , it had the same disappointing picture quality .
bought this because of the special from bestbuy  .
worked fine with blu ray disc , but when i played the regular dvd it keep skipping  .
updated the firmware , and it work fine for 1 disc  .
same problem exist after that  .
finally , it just stop working and said disc cannot be played  .
this is my second unit , after bestbuy is willing to replace the first one that did the same thing  .
will not buy another samsung blu ray player  .
wish i had read all the bad review at cnet before buying this junk  .
awful product , and worse support  .
i'm taking it back to best buy and by something reliable .
bought this product to match with my samsung tv and because it had the fastest loading time back then (and probably still) cannot ask money back although it failed twice already .
the first p1600 i brought home did not work right out of the box  .
the start up screen would flick in and out then about 30 seconds later it flicks out for good until i power off then on again only to experience the same problem (also , lots of snow )  .
it detected available upgrades but i cannot even start the upgrade process before it flicks out  .
thinking i just had bad luck with this unit , i exchanged it for another only to have the same problems  .
now i am thinking it is not compatible with my panasonic viera flat screen has anyone experienced the same problems  .
is there a special tv mode i should put my panasonic viera into  .
caution  .
i is thrilled when the upgrade came out last friday that added youtube and blockbuster streaming to pandora and netflix  .
i would have rated the machine a 5 before , netflix streaming and pandora worked perfectly with my ethernet cable fast cable internet , blu    ray played perfectly and i is happy  .
the upgrade came up automaticaly on my ethernet and i upgraded only to discover that while youtube and netflix work perfectly the upgrade destroys pandora and crashes and freezes machine after 5 minutes of playing  .
repeated re    boots of blu    ray player get the same 5 minute play then freezeup ;  .
i just called samsung support and to their credit they promptly answered on a holiday weekend and the support person is knowledgeable and polite but she quiclkly determined this is a known issue and she said it will be fixed with the next software upgrade but she has no idea when that will be  .
i specifically bought this machine for pandora , which i adore , not for any of the other features so unless there is a quick fix this machine must go back  .
luckily i have a 90 day return where i bought it i bought the bd    p1590 not the bd    p1600 but these two machines are identical except the p1600 has the annoying front panel cover which the p1590 lacks so these comments should still apply  .
netflix and youtube work perfectly after the upgrade only pandora is affected .
i bought this from bestbuy  .
it worked well for 3 weeks and then it started freezing  .
called samsung but the tech guy said i have to reboot by pulling the plug off when it freezes  .
so , i went and exchanged it at bestbuy the second one is much better  .
i lasted a full 46 days before it stopped working  .
does not even load the disk now  .
it's beyond the exchange period  .
so , i'm hoping samsung will honor its warranty without making me spend too much money in shipping the product to them , etc good player when it works  .
$300 for a player that breaks in few weeks is outrageous  .
not something i expected from samsung  .
very disappointed .
i purchased a samsung bd    p1600 2 months ago  .
it would not play australia , quantum of soice , or slumdog millionaire movies in blu    ray format  .
it did play some older blu    ray titles i borrowed from friends i spoke to samsung immediately about this problem  .
they told me to check their website for a firmware update  .
it's been 3 months and no updates it is amazing to me to find a newly designed blu    ray player that does not support the industry's formats .
sorry i replaced my yamaha dvd with this piece of junk  .
now buying yamaha blu    ray .
besides the fact that i found on    line that many people had the same issue , the support is near unbelievable  .
i started with the website to get a firmware download and kept getting a blank web page  .
got online and did the chat thing and is told to do a reset (even after explaining that i had tried that a few times)  .
i asked about the download and is told i is going to get a link  .
waited awhile and then is told to get online and fill out a repair request because it is an internal component issue i took his link went on    line , entered the data and then the website indicated i had hardware warranty until 12    2010 but my labor expired 3    2010 and because labor is not covered i had to call  .
called and the lady told me after checking my serial number that my warranty had expired  .
i explained that she must be going off the manufacture date and not my purchase date of 12    15    2010 (per my dell invoice)  .
i also told her i is looking at my website online submission that had the manufacture date she must be going by  .
she kept telling me , sorry but your warranty has expired  .
i then vented a bit and asked if that meant if a box sits at best buy for 12 months that i have no warranty coverage if i buy it  .
after being on hold at least for 10 minutes she came back and told me that i would have to supply a bos (bill of sale) and fax that information and that in two business days i would be contacted and given more information  .
i then asked what the labor cost would be exact words were , obviously this is a problem all over for this unit from my google hits , so just tell me what your charging for labor  .
sorry sir , you will have to get that from the person who will contact you  .
i is going to leave it at that but my wife took the phone and asked for a supervisor  .
after being on hold 15 more minutes she spoke to someone who said they would supply a shipping label so we would not be charged for that on top of labor and that the fee is a flat $50 , so yes , they did know what the cost would be i'm typing this because i promised them and myself that i is going to post a review and comments on every samsung/bluray website i can find over the next few days do not , i repeat , do not buy one of these since it will eventually crap out and then you'll have to deal with support  .
i shot a good hour total and i still have to fax my dell invoice , wait 2 days for the call , wait for the shipping label and then wait for them to receive , fix and ship it back for $50  .
all for a unit only 9 months old with very little use  .
if i had not swung for the $70 proprietary wireless usb adapter i'd have thrown the thing in the garbage , cursed for awhile , vowed never to purchase anything samsung again and just chalked it up as another life learning experience  .
learn from me and avoid the samsung .
read the other 20 posts about the same problem  .
i wouldn't chance another one if it is $50  .
very dissappointed samsung did not recall these when it seems over 1/2 fail .
samsung obviously has serious software issues with this player , when i bought it i read poor reviews about it not working after the firmware update    but figured surely they had it figured out 6 months later  .
wrong  .
when i tried to install the may 2010 it froze never to work again  .
blue ray players that don't work are useless  .
and i did not intend to buy a 6 month player  .
they need to at least fess up to this issue and offer some rememdy to all users .
out of any electronic purchase i have ever made in my life i have never been more dissatisfied that with this one  .
from the moment i took it out of the box , i is experiencing problems  .
the display freezes , the audio is out of sync , the picture freezes , it does not play 6 out of 10 discs , the firmware never updates properly  .
i have never wasted so much time resetting , researching , and trying to correct a problem with a piece of technology in my life  .
i feel like submitting a bill to samsung for my time  .
i own a tv from samsung and could not be happier ; i went on pure reputation for the blu ray player , so much for that theory  .
then i went to schedule a repair request , but to my luck , they only have a 3 month labor warranty  .
a complete and utter failure in every way  .
samsung , you have tarnished your image with me for life  .
you just lost a customer .
for the first 3 months , it played most of blu    ray discs (rejected only 1 or 2 , i assumed that is due to problems on the discs)  .
now , it cannot play any blu    ray disc and even reject some dvds  .
those blu    ray work fine on my other player total disappoinement  .
didn't bother to call their customer support  .
i do not want to pay $85 for this junk will not buy any other samsung products again .
wont power on correctly , if it continues to say load , then you have to power it off/on until it loads correctly and says no disc  .
this is a known issue , but you are required to pay to have it fixed after 90 days  .
just got off the phone , and they said i would have to pay to have it fixed (4 months old) , even though it's a known issue with these players .
worked great for about a dozen times , then broke one month after the useless 1 year parts only warranty  .
save your money and purchase from a company with integrity .
my wife paid more for this device at blockbuster than if she'd gone to walmart and bought another blueray device  .
samsung should have insisted that blockbuster only only sell the 3600 model or carry the usb device  .
very unhappy about having to order the device from another source  .
do not buy this from any video store if you want to use the network service .
i love gadgets and this is no exception  .
i researched this particular blu    ray player and because good reviews and low price i picked one up from best buy  .
the first one would not even play a disc  .
(not even a cd)  .
so i just figured it is that particular one  .
got a replacement and used it a couple of ties  .
a month later is when all the problems above started happening  .
the part that bugs me its its intermitent , but the one constant seems to be wth disney movies  .
i have a samsung tv (which had issues too) and the bose v10  .
i would rate this far below abysmal if cnet would let me .
sent it to the factory twice and it worked ok once when returned and then it reverted to the same old problems  .
warrenty has expired  .
now  .
i would strongly advise anyone to avoid this machine  .
i curse the samsung bd  91600 check the amazon reviews ; there are 100's who had the same problems as i .
it hangs up on every cd  .
wont play a cd all the way thru  .
i never got the chance to hook it up to the internet  .
never upgraded the firmware like others said caused the problem  .
i is just over my warranty period so samsung won't touch it  .
i now have a $150 junk brick  .
samsung has basically aknowledeged the load error issue  .
if you select it on their site under troubleshooting , they do not give you any other option than it needs service  .
check all over the internet and cnets discussions  .
you will see how many people were screwed over the past year  .
samsung has no fix  .
i am back to using my 8 year old sony dvd player which still works perfect after being used 100's of times  .
read up before you buy  .
i will never buy from samsung again because they obviously just do not care that they are selling junk .
it is on sale at bestbuy for $129  .
there is a reason it is that cheap  .
i have never had a bad samsung product until now  .
other reviews were accurate about lousy performance  .
if you pause a movie to long the player returns to the home screen not the main disk menu  .
when you hit play again it starts over with the trailers  .
it does not seem to remember where you were last watching  .
over all it is just a piece of junk  .
i would recommend spending more money on a better player  .
i am going to try a sony .
stay away from this and all other samsung products  .
if you buy one and ever need service then you will be wasting a lot of time on the phone and get no where  .
buy sony and get a good product .
tried to connect wirelessly , no joy  .
tried connecting wired , no joy  .
tried connecting with a static ip , no joy  .
interface lacks any tools to assist in diagnosing the problem  .
i am a network engineer so i do have a clue router never sees the device in either wired or wireless mode .
if a company only gives you 3 months worth of a warranty , that should tell you something  .
to charge 85 bux for labor should tell you more  .
never buying samsung ever again .
within a few weeks of purchasing this product , we downloaded the firmware and it made our $200 machine completely freeze  .
we sent our player into samsung to have fixed under the warranty , that is 2 months ago we still haven't received it back  .
i would think that after spending such good money on a product that first of all , it would work longer than a couple of weeks , and second that the service department of samsung would quickly rectify the problem and send it back to the consumer  .
please do not buy anything samsung  .
we need to support companies in our society that care about the consumer  .
when you hook it up via wireless the unit will find that is has a new firmware update and like most technology you update it  .
so i did and than the thing indicated it could not read the disk  .
i called samsung canada and they said since i up dated the firmware without a service person telling me to , that voided my warranty  .
i discuss with his manager and he said the same thing i asked to talk to his manager and he said he did not have one , i said everyone is service has a manager  .
so be warned about buying any samsung products  .
if you follow the on screen upgrades you are on your own  .
even page 55 states to update the the product on occasion , i have worked in technology for 25 years and never have i heard of such a policy  .
i will never buy a samsung product again .
i would not recommend this product to anyone  .
i regret buying it and wish i looked into other players not made by samsung .
the first bd    p1600 we had installed in our new home theater is doa , with massive pixelation artifact on all menus and playback  .
our installer is nice enough to take the unit and install a new one  .
our second ran fine for a week but is unusable after the 2  .
05 firmware upgrade  .
tech support is unhelpful and evasive  .
they are clearly instructed to cya .
poor customer service response  .
samsung refuses to acknowledge selling a defective product  .
product broke less than two months after purchase  .
heats up quickly , fire hazard  .
tech said had defective mother board  .
but customer service said the replacement part is free but that they would charge me $90 for labor and $20 for shipping which is more than half of the price i paid for the unit  .
definitely not a good deal .
i is a big fan of samsung products , but after this experiance , i think ill look elsewhere  .
i bought 3 units for christmas gifts  .
1 for myself and 2 others to give away  .
all 3 units had problems  .
samsung is going to charge us 150  .
00 just to look at it  .
i bought these @ circuit city  .
you know , the one that went belly up  .
so i couldnt take them back .
do yourself a favor and buy from another , more reliable manufacturer  .
i've never had problems with sony or panasonic products  .
in this case , i will not be repairing my samsung player because it will cost almost as much to fix as to buy a decent panasonic blu    ray player .
when it does work it takes forever to load  .
then three months and 2 days after minimal use i get a cannot read disk on all blu ray disks  .
took it back in and is informed it would cost a minimum of $80 to fix a $200 player  .
do not think so  .
i expected much better from samsung  .
tv's are great but if this is an example of the quality of blu ray players they are putting out , i will stay away .
bought the bdp    3600 no problems works the way i expected .
i'm not sure if i like the flip down front pannel it not so nicelook .
IT DOES WHAT'S ADVERTISED, BD LIVE, BLOCKBUSTER, NETFLIX, PANDORA AND YOU TUBE WORK WELL. GREAT PICTURE AND SOUND. THIS IS MY FIRST BLU-RAY PLAYER SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO COMPARE IT TO.; WIRELESS ADAPTER SOLD SEPARATELY ( AND YOU WILL NEED IT TO GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH ) IT WAS $70 AT BEST BUY. REQUIRES A USB MEMORY DRIVE AS STORAGE. THAT HAS TO PLUG IN ON THE FRONT , WHICH PREVENTS THE FRONT FLAP FROM CLOSING , WHICH LOOKS TACKY.
Netflix/Pandora streaming, 1080p output is crisp; WiFi not included (extra-cost not-yet-released dongle),BD-Live support requires 1GB memory not included (extra cost USB flash drive)
It played about 10 blu ray disks over a 3 month period?; Failed after 3 months.
Pandora, netflix, youtube; Works once then done.....sold 150 units and now i owe 150 appologies.....run away
Netflix streaming; Lots problems after 3 months. Can't play any Blu-Ray even some DVDs. Firmware updates didn't do any good.
Feature set and price; Electronics will not hold up.
Netflix, Pandora, Decent Blu-Ray; Front panel seemed cool at first, color coding for features not very efficient.
Netflix is very cool..; Annoying audio pop every 2 seconds in stop mode with disc inserted.
What pros, The unit only worked 1 time.; I wouldnt buy a samsung. Ill go elsewhere.
Lots of features. Blu-ray, pandora, netflix...; Wireless not included. Wireless card from Samsung only (read further for cheap workaround). False advertising
Streaming audio and video, easy setup, good picture, plenty of connections; Proprietary wireless dongle
nothing....; firmware updates do not come in fast enough, sony doesn't have this problem (see chat below with samsung rep)
Fast disk load time. Streaming via Netflix, Pandora (and now Blockbuster and YouTube). Sleek design.; No weaknesses noted thus far.
Good blu ray picture.; Will not play regular DVD disc. It skipped, and finally won't play anymore.
NETFLIX IN HD!, PANDORA free radio, Great HD sound, Great HD picture.; I'm not sure if I like the flip down front pannel....?
Streaming Netflix, fast load; Unit failed in 3 weeks. Had to be shipped back to Samsung. Waited four weeks for return.
Worked great when it was working; only lasted one month after the 1 year parts only warranty
it's black. worked for the first month; Cheaply made. Samsung warranty service is pathetic. slow load times
Its a BluRay player; Network sucks and interface lacks tools to properly diagnose problems
Netflix and Pandora support. Nice picture while it lasted; Abysmal reliability, dangerously buggy firmware upgrades
Fast operational speed and slick interface.; Major audio lag. Firmware update process could kill the player if done over network.
Great inexpensive Blue Ray player; could cost you an extra $75 to view Pandora, Netflix, Blockbuster and YouTube.
The unit does a lot for the price paid, good value for the dollar.; The confusion in getting connecting could be made simple. For people like me
Lots of features, streaming netflix, wireless connection.; Have to buy separate dongle for wireless and flash drive, no PC streaming.
Has pandora internet radio and netflix; Defective mother board causing the unit to heat rapidly and pose a fire hazard.
Looks good. That's it.; Loud, slow to load. Runs hot even in open well ventilated cabinet. Only played 2 blue rays and one DVD before major malfunction. Froze up, wouldn't respond to remote or panel controls. Firmware update didn't fix.
The product is very good when it works. Netflix feature is very good.; Works only for a few weeks.
Easy to set up, works awesomely with a Samsung HDTV.; The wirelss linkstick does not come with it. It's a separate purchase of $80.
Nice picture. Small footprint; Local Area Network Connection would not work - period. Spent far too many hours trying to reconfigure settings, networks, tests, etc. No excuse for this kind of network connection performance in todays world.
Not a bad price, I do not like the long front door.; BE WARNED ABOUT BUYING ANY SAMSUNG PRODUCTS. Upgrading the firmware without a service person telling you to, will voided the warranty.
nothing good; Unit failed in 1 day during playing my 1 bluray movie and if you call Sansumg they will repair this lemon...........no change for a brand new one.No Way,!!!
Picture quality is great, good looks, Youtube support is neat.; Has pausing issues with some new BluRay movies (UP, Star Trek, Harry Potter), while old ones work fine. Samsung put out firmware updates to correct issues with specific movies but introduces more problems as well.
Small Footprint, easy setup, no problems like others have had; Wishes there were 2 USB Ports in the rear, instead of 1 in front and 1 in back.
Picture quality, both Blu-ray and up-conversion (exceptionally good), menu and screen layout, easy internet hookup, access to Netflix, Pandora, and YouTube, automatic firmware upgrade, clean design.; Slow Blu-ray load (seems characteristic of all Blu-ray players)
Netflix, Pandora; Everything.. There are known issues with this product, but Samsung wants you to ship it back, with a minimum repair cost of $85.
Worked fine until Samsung killed its own machine with it's crappy code.; When I tried to install the May 2010 firmware upgrade it froze never to work again.
Plays blue ray and DVDs well; Some DVD/CD formats aren't supported. Wireless isn't sujpport out of the box. Wireless part NOT available from seller (Blockbuster). Apple TV is is the standard for what the network portion should be.
Sharp crisp welcome screen. Ability to stream Netflix, and Pandora Internet Radio! Awesome Picture quality, Sound. Faster start time of movies than Sony, Silent running.; Unable to connect to the internet wirelessly without BUYING ADAPTER!
The Netflix streaming video is the main reason I purchased this player.; I can't get it to work!
netflix, dvd's play well, including old dvd + and dvd- personal movies; front door is unnecessary, usb connection can connect to hard drive, but will not play .avi and other movie formats. netflix interface not as refined as insignia (does not allow adding instant titles)
Fine image quality ? when the player was working.; When I tried updating the firmware, the player froze and now will not work at all. And the machine has been slow and balky ever since I bought it.
small, lightweight, easy to use, netflix capable, excellent picture, great features like Netflix and Youtube, plus our's was free! Woohoo!; There is nothing I don't like about it.
Nice picture when it works.; I used about 3 or 4 times over a 3month period. Sometimes it worked then I would get Load errors. Unplugged it and then it would work. Now it only gets load errors. Nothing works but power. Google search on BD-P1600 Issues BEFORE BUYING! BRICK!!!
Fantastic picture and easy use; 1. The labor warranty runs out in just 90p days. Ours broke at 95 days. the minimum cost for repair is 85.00. taking the total cost over 300.00 in the first year.
Standard DVD's definately better and BluRay disks are perfect. Loads / Reads / Resumes / ejects promptly as expected; Haven't been able to connect wireless yet in order to view added features. Additional cost to do so is disappointing but not a deal breaker.
Looks good when it's working; Netflix sometimes plays with sound and no picture--reboot and it works (sometimes); doesn't appear to load recent Warner Brothers BR disks (Sherlock Holmes, Invictus) but plays ads at start up--no skipping ahead enabled. (Your time is free!)
Good video when it worked, although sound lagged some times; I went through two of these in two months. The second time it made it just past the 1 month return warrenty. Now it's a paper weight. Very dissapointed with Samsung.
When it worked I really enjoyed the Netfilx feature.; Firmware made machine completely die. We sent the machine into samsung to be fixed under warranty, that was 2 months ago and we are still waiting.
Bundled Netflix, Pandora, and with Firmware update, Youtube and Blockbuster streaming. Reasonable price, quick load times, and continuous firmware updates.; Firmware updates not always easy to perform. Firmware 2.3 made the Wi-Fi almost inoperable.
having access to pandora and netflix is great, but the load times are slow and now thing wont load or open the disc tray. After 6 months of ownership the player has never completely satisfied me.; slow load times, multiple errors.
When it works, it works well. Great audio and picture. The Wireless adapter, while a bit on the expensive side, works very well.; It's a little slow at loading and starting Blu-Ray DVD's. Several titles simply produce a message "This disc connot be played". Risky firmware upgrades.
netflix instant streaming; player decides not to respond to it's remote or the universal remote when it feels overused; don't do the firmware update, it takes forever to download and caused nothing but issues afterwards.
Good attempt at an all in one unit.; BEWARE! IT DOES NOT PLAY BLU-RAY DISCS. I bought this player 4 months ago. We loved it. Then we found the issues streaming netflix. Samsung issued a firmware upgrade that helped. About 3 weeks ago it simply stopped playing blu-ray discs.
I like the bluray player itself. Telephone support is awesome at level one and level two.; internet connectivity is quirky at best. You can get a connection, good luck keeping the connection. After several reboots, master reboots and having my network checked out I took it back.
The picture quality is good. Fast loading time.; Failed twice in 3 months. First the picture then the sound. Looks and feels cheap for a product that costs this much (300 EUR).
Good Picture as expected on all Blue Ray Players.; False Advertising! The Box says Wireless and Netflix Instant Streaming Ready ... It isn't! You find out only after opening the box that an $80 USB LAN Adapter is required and only the Samsung product will work.
- Great Picture, which is equal to P3600. - Netflix &#38; Pandora Streaming. - Supports major HD audio formats. - Fast Load Times. -; - No integrated memory for BD-Live (Profile 2.0). - No WiFi dongle. - DVD playback not as good as my Panasonic DMP30. - Minor audio hick-ups while watching DVD's and listening to audio via HDMI through TV
Cheap Price for a blu-ray. Other than that none; Freezes. Doesnt play properly. No audio half the time. Long and Loud boot time. non compatable with Bose remote.Firm ware update screen always shows, regarless of Firmware version. Does not like Disney Blu-ray.
Played UP movie - picture and sound (optical connection to 5.1 Yamaha Rcvr) are great.; CNET review shows DVD+R supported. Not so. I need DVD+R for slide shows. Based on CNET review, I bought BD-P1600. Manual says DVD+R is not supported and phone call to Samsung confirmed that they do not support DVD+R. Returning unit this afternoon.
Ease of set up, good quality of picture, Netflix and Pandora streaming, price.; Front panel stays open after eject of disk. Could of done with out the front panel. A little noisy while waiting for disk to load.
The streaming capabilities of this player are awesome! When it streams an HD movie or show from Netflix, it's crystal clear. Pandora is neat too. The Blu-Ray picture is AMAZING.; Not the Best Standard DVD up-converting. It's not horrible though, either. The YouTube functionality is neat, but typing in what you want via the text messaging format is tiring.
netflix and pandora were great while the thing worked.; when it breaks down, Samsung makes it impossible for you to get it fixed. Ate my netflix dvd, took 3 weeks to get a shipping label, had to box it myself, and charged me $85 for labor BEFORE even touching it to fix it. AWFUL CS. 5 weeks w/o it.
Low Price.; Box says "wireless ready" plus the Netflix and Blockbuster logos on the box. Seems like you would have a plug and play machine...like all the laptops, iphones, etc... No, you will need to shell out another $70+ for a Samsung linkstick.
The picture quality is very good.. Nice being able to stream Netflix, Pandora, etc.; Too many problems ALWAYS encountered when trying to play either DVD's or Blu-Ray discs. Unresponsive controls and the firmware update process actually made the unit unusable.
Netflix, Pandora, YouTube.; small button remote, poor ergonomics. Never downloaded the firmware per the message board warnings here. Every BR DVD and regular DVD has worked, including the Imovie DVD+R's. This is a con simply because I had to be aware of it.
The picture quality of this unit was great, and super easy to set up.; The unit broke down and stopped playing BD after 2 weeks. It would begin playing movies, and about 30 minutes into the movie, would start skipping and eventually stop playing. Happened with 3 different Blu ray movies.
PQ - Netflix and Pandoroa streaming - DolbyHD and DTS-MA HD - Load speed; Wi-Fi dongle not avaialable yet but can pre-order on Amazon for $35 - ETA of April 17th. Wish that both USB ports were on the back - to use the front USB port means that the flip down panel can't be closed.
Very fast loading of DVD's and Blu-ray's, great menu's, excellent netflix and pandora as well as firmware updates are way simple; must be wired or connected to a network device unless you buy the samsung wi-fi dongle. I just used my airport express.
Great player does its job. Does netflix, pandora, and blockbuster stuff. Simple and easy to use which is great because I don't care about electronic equipment.; The only problem I had was the length of the power cord. IT IS SHORT! Roughly about 2 ft.
Lots of features make this product worthwhile.; Tech support cannot answer the simple question can this player play DVD+R's or not. The owners manual says no, the specification pdf on Samsungs website says yes. Pulling it out and trying it on a couple of discs is not an answer.
Disagree with the reviewer's view that front panel is a design flaw. The front panel is very appealing for those that rate aesthetics in the home. Looks great in my loungeroom and using the unit with a front panel is no hassle at all.; Haven't found any yet. I'm still smiling everytime I look at it. :)
Great picture whjen it occassionally worked; Have yet to play a blu-ray disk without having some dificulty like getting a "snow" picture with no sound. when you stop a movie, the machine can't remember where it was and I'd have to start all over from the beginning. Sometimes the sound stops
This is my third Bluray player. It's byfar the best one I've owned. Extremely easy to setup. Worked perfectly right out of the box. The firmware update went extremely easy and fast. The Bluray picture is outstanding. DVD up-converting is also.; The remote seems a little touchy. Some of the buttons are a little small. But this is just "small insignificant stuff"
Pandora, Netflix and You Tube Great sound and picture when it plays.; Samsung customer service wanted $85.00 plus shipping for service no way. Returned to store exchanged for a brand new model. (Bernies in Ct) No use for a 1 year warranty if parts and labor are only covered for 90 days.
Hooked up to my lan as soon as I started up. A lot faster Blu-ray start up than my lap-top drive. Netflix works flawlessly. Pandora in interesting but I have all the music I need through Comcast, Would rather see Amazon on Demand; The Wi-Fi USB dongle is $82 dollars. That's almost a third of the price of the player. The flip down front access panel is a real throw back.
price was attractive; Wireless conifg failed out of the box. I connected it wired network and upgraded the firmware. After another firmware update (assume it is for the wireless USB), I was able to get wireless to work - until I turned it off. Each time I have to rcnfig
You can stream Netflix, Pandora, Blockbuster and YouTube. Excellent 1080p output and super fast video loading. The menu is simple and the initial setup is very easy. The Samsung has a beautiful design and an elegant flip down front panel.; This units comes WiFi Ready versus having WiFi already built in like the Samsung BD-P3600. So be prepared to run Ethernet cable or buy Samsung's WiFi adapter.
Up scales dvd's, updates your netflix queue instantly (also if you subscribe to series on starz it will in netflix), Fast lading times, easy networking, true 1080 (blu ray) 720 p upscale for dvd.; Main reason i bought it was the networking capability. Disappointed that samsung did not include built in wi fi / mention that this was not included . I therefore have a 50 foot cable running under my carpet to the one in my bedroom (i have two).
Small size, easy to set up. I appreciated that the manual presented how to set up the many options for connections, home theatre, wireless IP network. Liked Netflix and Pandora services tie-in.; While it worked: I found the main function (play, stop, rewind, etc.) buttons on the remote to be small and not well laid out. Slow disk load time, which didn't match the test review at all.
Blu Ray picture and sound is spectacular, very happy I made this purchase. I bought the Philips and was unhappy and took it back. Chose this for the added Netflix feature. Works Great and Pandora is crystal clear.; I moved my router downstairs so I could hook it up the the internet via ethernet. So fas so good, but wish it wasn't another $80 for a wifi adapter. Flip tray can be annoying but doesn't hinder anything.
It was great to have Netflix and Pandora while it lasted.; The first player only lasted two days. The second player lasted a while longer... until about 2 days after I allowed the firmware update over the network.
Good picture.; Bought the player brand new at Best Buy for Christmas. I did not try the USB port until today (April 2) The USB port does not work. It is defective. The player is out of the 3 month warranty and I have to pay 130.00 for labor. No more Samsung.
Nothing. I found nothing good about this player; Gets hung up all the time on CD's. It hasn't played one CD yet with out having a problem. I'm going to throw it away and by a different brand. I have had such a problem with this player that I will never buy another Samsung product again!!
I loved this and it worked perfectly (I used ethernet cable for connection) BEFORE 9/4/09 firmware upgrade which added YouTube streaming Upgrade destroys Pandora which now freezes &#38; crashes entire machine after a few minutes of Pandora play.; I upgraded firmware 9/4/09 which added YouTube access, Unfortunately, Pandora now freezes and crashes the entire machine after about 5 minutes of play. Samsung support says that this is a "known issue" and will be corrected in next upgrade.
Started off nice with price point good for the additional features of Netflix streaming, even added their 70 dollar wireless unit after we were happy with the performance; 9 months into ownership it locked on startup. Can't reset, can't load or update firmware, nothing. Getting agreement that I still had hardware warranty coverage took 30 minutes of phone time and I still have to fax, wait for call, ship and pay $50.
Very nice design. Load times are great! Menu user interface is good and easy to navigate. BlueRay movies look amazing!; Well, the only con right now is that when we put in a DVD the audio and video don't match up - very annoying; however, we have a DVD player, so, as long as it continues to play BlueRay fine - I won't complain.
I personally like the slick design, comes with YouTube, Wireless Adapter and Netflix and TiVO compatible.; Machine is buggy, reaction time from pressing a button on the remote to the machine performing that request is super slow, when FF-warding, it will suddenly slow down and picture will stop, unit shuts down automatically only some of the time.
It worked (and I say that sarcastically) for ony 8 months. Netflix was a huge bonus and never had problems with that.; Product never completely worked and forget the wireless dongle it was always to expensive to be worth it. Product only worked 8 months then completely went dead. As long as I had it, it always would lag or lock up and you would have to unplug it.
Plays Blue Ray and Netflix without issue; Can not play DVD's at all. When I asked for service I was told that parts were covered by the warranty but I would have to pay $50 for labor. I have had this player less than a year and it has never played DVD's.
I like the access to Netflix, Pandora, blockbuster and YouTube The remote is very easy to use and the functions are clearly marked.; I have had my player repaired once and sent back twice... the 2nd time the repair facility said they could not fix it and i then was approved for a new replacement box. it took 5 weeks to determine that it was unfixable and get the new one back
I like the features especially LAN plugin. Make Netflix and Pandora easy and high quality. Setup was not difficult, and the system updates its software automatically when you send it to the internet for Netflix, Blockbuster, Pandora or You Tube.; The systems most current software is not current enough to play some of the newer BR DVDs. We sit through the previews of shows we don't want to see, and then are disappointed that the player won't play the actual movie.
