i last reviewed this hotel on january 9 , 2009 and gave it an outstanding rating in all categories and overall ( i have stayed at this hotel 15 times , including my latest visit on january 1 , 2016 ) .
unfortunately , the hotel has slipped some .
the service by the hotel staff remains excellent ( although our server in the restaurant had a bit of an attitude - surprising given the extremely high cost of the restaurant - $ 90 for small meals for three ) , but the condition of the two rooms my family and i had was quite poor .
our tv did not work at all , the clock had the incorrect time ( and the time of hilton room clocks can not be adjusted ) , two lamps were inoperable , and the lights by one side of the bed did not work .
in the bathroom , the sink did not drain properly and one of the lights did not work .
the hotel itself is quite impressive looking ( glass elevators , sleek/dark design , etc .
) , but the number of malfunctioning items in the room left the impression that the hotel is paying insufficient attention to upkeep .
finally , although this was my 15th visit and i have hilton diamond status , the rooms were certainly not upgraded .
on the positive side , the breakfast buffet remains impressive !
overall , i was quite disappointed .
i will give this hotel one more chance ( it is the only hilton in madrid and quite close to the airport ) , but the hotel . . .
