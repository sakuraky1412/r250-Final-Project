this hotel is amazing from when you first arrive , for a glass of champagne , until you leave .
great staff who do all they can to help and advise .
the room was fine for two , but we were a party of three and it was quite cramped when the sofa bed was up .
breakfast was n't included , but was reasonably priced and very tasty indeed .
we ate at the restaurant one night and that was very good too with great service .
it is absolutely perfect for newport and everything is within walking distance .
so - why only very good ?
the cost really - i had booked it in advance and then looked two weeks before and the price had gone down by nearly $ 300 a night !
they did change the price for me immediately as i was outside of the seven day limit , but i would have been very disappointed to pay the original amount - it was n't worth that .
then on top of that , no breakfast included , $ 20 a day for valet parking ( which is about 20 yards around the back of the hotel ) and $ 75 dollars each night for the extra person , which was in the small print - so by far the most expensive stay on our road trip , and we stayed at great places .
final little moan is that the room was not cleaned until 5pm , and as we were only there two days it did n't give us . . .

final little moan is that the room was not cleaned until 5pm , and as we were only there two days it did n't give us any chance to relax in the room , we ended up hovering outside in the communal area while the maids did their work .
small points , but when paying so much would have expected better.
