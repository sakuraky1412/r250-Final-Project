come on guys this camera rocks  .

does everything you can think of in terms of pics video for a great price  .

it has features even a novice can understand yet great for the up coming pros  .

coming off another great , the olympus 320 , this has has it all .

i am a hobbyist photographer and i bought the camera based on the reviews here and elsewhere on the internet  .

they were very accurate descriptions of this product  .

for $270 it has been a great camera  .

i bought it primarily for shooting track and field  .

i have used it both indoors and out , and i take about 1500 photos a week  .

the 11 fps in high speed burst mode is excellent for working with athletes on mechanics  .

lighting indoors is a challenge for most cameras trying to capture fast action like track , but using hd video , high speed burst mode with speed priority , and high sensitivity mode have produced excellent results  .

the indoor sports mode has not been as effective for my purposes  .

i rarely use the flash as the sensitivity seems excellent for all types of shots indoors  .

zoom is smooth in movie mode and the hd videos come out great (albeit very large , but now that picassa allows 1g video uploads it is not such a problem)  .

i have used the starry night mode to take some ground light outdoor photos with a tripod and gotten surprisingly good results  .

i have not used most of the optional modes yet , but each time i try one it usually gives good results (fireworks turned out spectacular)  .

battery life is great (i shoot a week's worth of photos 1000    1500 on a single battery charge) and i bought a third party battery for $12 that works as good as the original  .

battery charging is quick , about an hour  .

my next adventure with this camera is infrared  .

it seems to have good ir response (aim your tv remote at the camera in a dark room and see if a light shows up on the lcd , the brighter the better) , so i will be getting a couple of filters to try it out  .

i look at photo results from better cameras taking the same shots as i do and i have yet to see anything that motivates me to upgrade (if the prices drop i may buy another and put it away for the day when this one wears out) .

this camera is a great semi    dslr camera , with so many pro's , there would be no point in waiting to get it  .

if you want a dslr , but do not have the money or the skills , thi is the best camera out there .

it is a great camera that will not disappoint .

great camera for those who wish to take photography before they start to use a true dslr camera .

i've use panasonic bridge cameras for a few years and this time they've really got it right  .

the larger sensor is not a big deal but the new venus iv engine makes the big difference  .

it manages to bring out all the quality the leica designed lens is capable of producing i first got a panasonic fz8 for the over 400mm lens capability  .

seemed cheaper to get the camera at about $300 then a dslr lens for over twice that  .

didn't use long lenses much so it seemed the way to go fell in love with the fz8  .

gave that one to my daughter for photographing birds and moved up to an fz18  .

the fz18 is magnificent  .

took it to europe and printed a show of big prints for a gallery  .

great color , great tonality debated getting the fz28 but after much thought and conversation with other photographers decided to give it a try  .

i am very happy i did i am a pro and i have and shoot nikon dslrs  .

the new fz28 produces images that are comparable to the images from my d80  .

and i'm talking about comparing 11x17s side by side this is a great camera  .

its perfect for the photo enthusiast looking to move up to a better camera then a point and shoot and the perfect carry camera for a pro who does not need to take their dslrs with them all the time needless to say i will use the fz28 on jobs where i need an extra long telephoto lens i like it that you can use the fz28 as a totally automatic camera or use it in total manual control mode  .

it does take a little practice to get the hang of the zoom and using the camera in macro mode etc but the learning curve will be quick for most people panasonic has happily dealt with the noise issues that diminished the ratings of their otherwise astonishing cameras  .

at 100 and 200 iso i cannot find any noise and at 400 and 800 there is some noise but nothing that will show up on 8x10 prints the evf screen is smaller than on the fz18 or fz8 and is a bit harder to use  .

not a big problem but it is smaller  .

the lcd monitor is bigger and it might have been nice if it is rotatable but these are minor issues the fz28 is a great bridge camera that for most people will be more than enough for all their photography .

the fz28 has so many ways to customize its self that you can literally mold it to fit the way you want to take pictures  .

it's a third of the price of a good dslr and so is a great way to get better pictures than using a compact digital camera without spending alot of cash  .

(it's a good middle ground camera)  .

the lens is very high quality with very little barrel distortion at the telephoto end  .

it even shoots hd video  .

it really has everything that one could ask for in a camera short of the higher overall quality that a camera three times the price could get you  .

but , it even has some advanced features that even good dslr's do not have  .

(subject focus auto lock    keeps subject focused even if it moves around in the frame) .

this is my moms camera that i use all the time  .

i love this camera  .

the autofocus has a little trouble when im shooting bees but thats to be expected  .

does really well in low light and takes great photos  .

recent images from yellowstone and grand teton are stunning  .

the 18x zoom is remarkable  .

macro works great , and images of the moose 40 feet away turned out decent (forgot to switch from macro in the excitement)  .

flash function works well  .

easy to switch to burst or video .

this camera is bought on a whim , i is looking for a replacment for my old waterproof camera , saw this and decided to buy it  .

i love it , there is a slight plastic feel to the buttons but ones you get used to it you do not even notice that , the camera is so light compared to some others i have tried out  .

i have never found it so easy to take nice photos  .

this is a great bridge camera , you could keep it on ia for ever and never have to worry , but it has enough functionality to explore how to take different photos using the different functions available , it may not have the zoom of some of the newer cameras coming out , but are they really needed , and are they as easy to use  .

i would roccomend this camera to any one , my father who has had a 50 year passion for cameras even grudgingly admit that the quality of photos were almost as good as the ones taken with his medium range dslr and that it negates the need to carry round lots of different lenses with the great 28mm to 486mm (optical) lens (on full 10  .

1 mp) but if you step down the quality slightly it gets even better  .

battery life is fantastic , only thing i would really moan about is that when using the evf it can feel a little hard and plastic .

the panasonic lumix dmc    fz28k is an overall outstanding semi    compact digital camera with dslr    like features and versatility updated  .

on dec 26 , 2008  .

great lens much detail  .

works more like an slr than a point and shoot so adjusting to this will take time and experiences  .

great potential for the experienced user .

i bought the camera because i got to use a friend's fz 18k and liked the image quality  .

i'm glad i waited for the fz 28  .

the range of the zoom is a major selling point and the leica lens is clear and crisp  .

the camera also shoots hd video at 720p 30fps and the i is amazed at the quality  .

at full automatic full point and shoot the pictures fine and the camera supports a good array of manual options  .

the menus are intuitive and easy to understand  .

last night i took a number of moon lit shots and had no trouble finding my way through the necessary commands (for the first time) in the dark  .

it's light , very thrifty in terms of power consumption and the controls are laid out well  .

i didn't want to go back to the bad old days when i carried around my big and heavy eos body and multiple lenses and attachments but i wanted quality pictures and a wide range of zoom ; this camera fits the bill perfectly  .

i'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who does not want to go the full dslr route .

i am a bird watcher and my shots are as good or better with this camera of birds in flight and in stationary positions than several much more expensive dslrs , the owners of those cameras have admitted this to me after seeing my shots  .

it starts fast shoots decent burst speeds and is relatively easy to use  .

has hd video mode with sound that i use on birds in flight as well  .

great camera  .

i did a lot of research before buying this camera and i mean a lot , it took me almost three months deciding between different brands , this one is the winner , i'll recommend the same advise but yes , i do luv my panasonic  .

ps   just try it .

the price jump has made it look overpriced for its features  .

albeit its competitor canon sx10 is is around 400 dollars  .

but fz28 is definitely more compact  .

i bought it because i got it for under 250 dollars brand new , and if i had extra cash to spend , i would have definitely bought canon sx10 because for my requirements , both the cameras perform equally well , but canon adds twist and tilt lcd screen stereo mic , and hot shoe .

this is a fantastic camera for the money  .

if i had not ever fooled around with a dslr , i would be completely content  .

once you learn how to use this camera well , it makes you yearn for something more powerful but the fz28 rarely really disappoints in image quality or general usability  .

it's quite light and portable , i'm always riding my bicycle with it around my neck .

a great camera with enough versatility to replace some low    end dslr kits  .

definitely beats lugging around several lenses worth a small fortune  .

s easy to get razor    sharp photos with good lighting  .

camera is remarkably light in weight and does not tire the user when carrying or aiming for extended periods  .

many manual controls  .

extremely tight body case with very good ergonomics and controls  .

lcd is pinpoint sharp and clear with a very usable high    angle mode user must be mindful of the auto    focus lamp  .

covering it with a finger is easy to do  .

it would be nice if the tripod receiver is centered along the lens barrel  .

camera does not deploy flash automatically if needed  .

auto    focus does seek a bit more with less light  .

raw mode available but very slow    save this feature for posed or arranged shots when time is less critical  .

panasonic probably could have trimmed down the size of the case just a bit more , but i could be sorely mistaken  .

i doubt they could have saved any more weight , since it is a very light camera  .

the lcd viewfinder is fairly functional , but is too small and not the sharpest despite some small quirks , highly recommended  .

a quality camera that's a definite step up from most point and shoot cameras , but it has limitations  .

relatively compact , good balance , and light weight makes it a joy to carry around your neck all day  .

it's our vacation and hiking companion and always in the car , ready to go and ready to use from zoom to macro without having to change lenses  .

lumix cameras are very well built , have top quality leica lenses , and have been perfectly dependable for me for the past 5 years (a lumix dmc    fz4) outdoor pictures and portraits are gorgeous , but are grainy if blown up , even at when set at 10 mg and low asa  .

i think the problem is the ccd (light sensor) that is much smaller than in dslr cameras we're ardent birders , and this camera has a hard time focusing sharply and quickly through brush and leaves  .

manual focus is hard to use  .

the camera is slow to start up , and time between shots is relatively slow compared to a dslr , even in sports mode  .

that's a real problem when trying to photograph flighty birds and insects so in conclusion , i love and recommend this camera , our third lumix , and will continue using it for years  .

it's a lot of camera for the price  .

but i intend to buy a mid    range dslr for demanding wildlife photos and indoor photography without a flash .

not too sure whether i like it or not  .

i bought this camera for a two week vacation to paris , rome and florence  .

i made around 2000 images with 1000 interior shots  .

this camera is a near complete failure in shooting well lit interiors  .

over 60% of my shots are useless , totally out of focus  .

in addition , even some exterior shots are out of focus  .

i relied almost exclusively on the ia mode and didn't try any manual shutter or aperature priority modes or custom modes  .

be adivsed    this camera is not trustworthy  .

do not rely on it until you have thoroughly tested in all the shooting environments your will face  .

i had great expectations and now have nothing but 23gb of useless files .
