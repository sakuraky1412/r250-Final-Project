in addition to having every conceivable meeting resource , the setting in the largely undiscoved peloponnese is undeniably beautiful .
 this is a great place for wealthy albeit insecure travelers who are inordinately risk averse .
 with the exception of the rent-a-cop guard at the entrance who appears to be re-enacting the worst experience in an airport security line , virtually all of the other staff seem genuinely warm and gracious .
 pros : the physical plant is impressive ; it includes 2 golf courses , endless swimming pools , walking paths and even a kite surfing facility .
 the beach itself is nice , but since it is totally unsheltered from the sea , the strong winds from africa often make swimming problematic .
 the hotel supports an artist in residence , happy to talk about his/her work with guests .
 the architecture is stunning .
 extraordinary breakfast buffet .
 cons : in addition to corporate groups , this westin seems to cater to large numbers of families with kids , which is unfortunate for those seeking a more adult oriented vacation .
 restaurants very uneven in quality and mostly overpriced relative to what 's available in nearby towns ; we had a very mediocre dinner combined with an unacceptably poor 'wine tasting ' for which we were billed close to €100 per person !
 `` chintzy '' internet service ; in four weeks of travel throughout europe , this was the only establishment that had the nerve to try to charge us a fee for in-room internet service ( it was free , though inconvenient , only in the lobby ) . . . .

 in sum , the experience was kind of what you might expect if walt disney had constructed an imitation greek village in the desert ; brilliantly done , but somehow artificial.
