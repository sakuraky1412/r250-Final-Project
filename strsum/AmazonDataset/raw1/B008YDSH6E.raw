Worked great!! I just wonder how long they last. Guess I'll find out. This product is very easy to install!!
I am a technician. I have been a technician since 1971. Having used Supco relays for over 30 years when they first became available,  I have always found them to be reliable and they saved me from carrying 40 or 50 types of relays in my truck.

Worked great thank you.
These start devices are great for all domestic refrigeration start device repairs. They exceed the original device and very easy to install.
Great deal and fast shipping!
