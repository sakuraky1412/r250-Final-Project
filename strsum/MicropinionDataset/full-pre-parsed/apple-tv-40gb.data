while the content is a little expensive , the apple tv now accounts for all my tv show watching (no ads , hd , replaces my dvr completely) and most casual movie nights (along with netflix streaming)  .

the ability to synch with itunes is very slick as it the ability for apple tv to share content from multiple pcs this is one of the best products to complement a dvd/blu ray player in your system  .

in fact i would say apple tv + the lg or samsung (i like the samsung because it also includes pandora) blu ray players that have netflix streaming are all one needs for a complete home theatre solution from the content side .

i have them all , i love this one most , my wife , kids , friends , itunes is the best way to get your home entertainment on , apple tv is my movie theatre , my dj , my life memories (photos , home videos , vac , wed , parties , ect)and most of all a tech freak .

i have to say i love my apple tv  .

gone are the days of finally picking a dvd to watch , only to open it and find the dvd is missing  .

i have about 200 movies sitting on a drobo storage robot connected to my imac  .

metax takes care of the cover art , content rating , and film descriptions  .

this is all accessed over my 802  .

11n network , which streams the movies flawlessly i love the fact that my physical media is used once and stored now  .

no more scratched or lost disks i store nothing on the device itself , so i kick myself that i did not buy the 40 gig model the remote leaves a little to be desired when trying to search youtube i really hope apple keeps this product line alive and keeps developing enhanced software upgrades for it .

some might argue that giving this product a rating of 10 is going overboard  .

and i'm not giving it a 10 because i have low expectations  .

here's the deal   if you love itunes and your ipod ; love tv shows and movies ; if you want a fast , easy way to turn your tv into a beautiful jukebox for said content , with simplicity that only apple seems to know how to provide you get an apple tv  .

if you're looking for a dvd player that does your dishes and washes your darks and lights separately    this is not the product streaming content is ridiculously fast  .

quality looks and sounds as good as the content you send to it  .

youtube is a welcomed bonus as of the other day just for it's jukebox    like functionality , i'm extremely happy    not to say that i'll be even happier when i can connect directly to the itunes store to download content but i knew buying it that i'd have to wait a while for that  .

sure , there's room for added features like higher quality content on the itunes website , but i'm not rating the itunes website rarely if ever has a first generation product met and exceeded it's expectations as with this one p  .

if you have movies that you found online , (dirty or otherwise) , you can simply convert them to apple tv format using any of a number of converting apps  .

{note   converting is quite literally 10+ times faster on a new intel core 2 duo than on a g4  .

on the c2duo figure about 1  .

5hrs to convert a 1gb file at highest quality settings} i find it highly worth it to spend $30 for a premium converter , like the one by roxio or visual hub  .

also simple to use .

despite what some reviewers have said (many not even owning an apple tv) i've found the video quality to be fine  .

it's a case of the quality that comes out is similar to what you put in it  .

so a low bitrate video designed for an ipod screen will look poor  .

but hd footage at a reasonable bitrate looks great  .

ripped dvds look pretty much the same as they would on a dvd player and divx downloads can be easily reencoded using quicktime pro streaming from my imac using  .

n wireless is very quick and almost like using synched content so the small hard disk is not realy an issue  .

even hd content can be streamed in this way the other features should not be underestimated either , the main wow factor seems to be the photos which look fantastic in a large hd tv my tv does not support 1080p and has 720 lines so the 720p output suits me fine , you can also use 1080i if that suits your tv better all in all it does everything i expected superbly which is why i gave it a 10 score the only problem i have is that when i update album artwork in itunes this is not always reflected on the apple tv  .

this can be sorted out by resetting the apple tv but that does also reset some of the settings such as tv resolution  .

i hope that this can be addressed with a simple software update another issue is a lack of hd content on itunes  .

i suspect that this has more to do with the content owners than apple but hopefully it will be addressed soon  .

in the mean time it will still play movies downloaded from bittorrent and dvd rips which saves me from having loads of dvds littering the living room i would recommend the apple tv to anybody who likes using itunes for their music and would like to take the same sort of user experience to their tv .

the setup is a breeze (and i'm no computer geek)  .

i've seen many bad reviews stating that it is not enough , but it does exactly everything that is advertised  .

playing music from my stereo system (not from small computer speakers) is great  .

the screen saver (pics from your computer) scroll up the screen while music is playing , looks great  .

it's nice to see pics of the kids or from a vacation on the big screen while your favorite tunes play in the background i recommend it  .

i am one of those windows fans    apple haters , but the apple tv made me switch from windows media player to itunes , and i love it .

one thing that no one can deny is that there's a lot of buzz surrounding this product regardless if you like it or not  .

the people who punched in low ratings spent the time to chime in on the next step in the evolution of the one box solution they like but wo not admit it .

apple tv fills a nitch that nothing else fills  .

it is not a lot of things , but what it does it does amazingly well  .

please check out the apple web site to see what it is made for  .

it does it better than i thought it would , and i am real believer in apple  .

the set up is totally transparent  .

totally  .

i set it up and started my downloading to it from itunes in 15 minutes  .

and that includes the time it took finding that little clear plastic tab to pull to get the remote out of the tight little slot it is in    that is the hardest part of the whole thing  .

i totally recommend this product  .

please keep in mind the majority of the prior negative reviews come from individuals who not own an apple tv the apple tv is simply an extension of your itunes library  .

if you like itunes , if you use itunes , you will love apple tv  .

streaming quality is excellent for those of you naysayers , the size of the hard drive is really irrelevant    your content can be streamed from your master itunes library on your pc/mac so go ahead , you power users with 300 terabytes of video , take the plunge    buy an apple tv , fall in love , and stop the hatin .

amazing  .

highly recommend to anyone .

if you do not own one , how can you review it  .

i'm giving it a 10 to offset these people .

everyones saying tivo is best , tivo is best but not for watching movie streaming directly to your tv with out any wires watching trailer live from internet and best of all to show your thousands of music , photos and movie that you already have in itunes with just one click see  .

it is better than tivo .

i have been waiting for this for a long time  .

the picture quality is awesome and i dont have to spend 700 dollars for a blue ray player  .

i can stream all my favorite shows  24  and movies to my hdtv and they look better than all my dvd's  .

i am actually going to start to replace all my dvd's ( i have around 900) with itunes movies if anything just to save space  .

i really have no complaints other than i am a little worried that when better resolution tv's come out is it going to be upgradeable to be compatible  .

i saw someone scored it a 1 just to even it out  .

ok people , grow up  .

pc has been owning the market for so long that people are going to hate apple just to hate them  .

in my opinion , apple doing so well lately should make pc owners happy  .

it will not do anything but force a competitive market and we will stop being raped by the pc makers  .

i'm sick of hearing everyone hating me because i own a mac  .

all it does is strengthen my resolve to own more of them  .

open your eyes and your mind and try to grasp more than just your pc ideals  .

in all this is great for the computer community  .

i for one cannot wait to see how pc and apple will compete with each other with technology , price , innovative products , etc  .

i hope this helps with anyone wanting to buy this product  .

it is worth the money i spent because of ease of use , and it works flawlessly and looks awesome .

this will finally play videos on your tv from your computer in hd  .

if will also make music sound great  .

i love its interface which makes browsing easy and even fun (yes i have used it)  .

every big screen tv owner should have one of these  .

it truely has apple genius .

i think apple needs to advertise this a little  .

i think you will not disappointed .

if you are looking to enhance your overall tv setup , then this product is perfect  .

you could have it on its own and be happy , but you will truly enhance your system if this is an additional part of your arsenal  .

it does not replace the dvr , surround sound or some times a dvd player  .

to truly get the most out of this product use the hdmi , rent in hd , use the optical sound to your surround sound , get familiar with youtube for some fun , add photos for a screensaver (super easy) , learn to rip your own dvds to your computer and stream them to the apple tv and enjoy  .

if you set it up correctly and learn all the features , the apple tv will add lots of fun and pizazz to your tv room  .

just purchased this apple tv yesterday , but so far it has met and exceeded my expectations i should note that i have always been a windows/pc user and thus , am not an apple fanboy eager to heap praise on anything apple sells  .

but , i must say , that after my experience with the new ipod touch and now , the apple tv , i may make the switch to a mac next time  .

the reason , both these products just plain work in a very simple and reliable fashion as far as the apple tv goes , it is a perfect solution to my needs i am amazed how easy the setup was  .

out of the box and streaming movies to my hd set in less than 30 minutes  .

i would take me about 5    10 minutes now that i have done it once i have a 36 inch hd set and the picture quality is excellent , assuming that the file itself is of good quality i got the less expensive 40 gb hard drive ($ 229  .

00)  .

i do not see why i would need to load anything onto the drive as you can stream content from your computer to the tv directly i have about 40 movies i had copied for viewing on my ipod touch ( check out cucusoft for this works great ) when put into the correct format these stream to the tv flawlessly i currently have a wireless g router and it works just fine  .

downloads start very quickly and i can start to watch almost immediately  .

after the inevitable upgrade to wireless n i imagine it will work even better perhaps with time , i may find some things which could be improved  .

but for now , i am simply amazed at how well this thing works .

with such a great second    coming of the product , i've got to wonder why apple is being so stingy with its 24    hour window to watch movies once you hit play  .

case in point    say you start a movie one night , and want to pick up the rest the next  .

you cant  .

or if you want to watch a scene over again the next night    you cant  .

other than that though , apple tv is the best option for bringing the web to the tv  .

itunes are great through a stereo system , the slideshow setting is wonderful to music , and ill never watch youtube on my computer again after doing it on apple tv  .

i can only hope that options improve in coming years with longer windows for viewing movies , wireless keyboard and internet browsing .

just fired up apple tv 2  .

0 this week and is impressed with the ease of connectivity and the devices operation  .

the part that i dreaded    connection to my home network    is completely painless  .

rented a standard def movie (70s vintage)and the quality is what i expected  .

also linked into my pc and used my photos as a screen saver  .

0 adds setup options for 1080p tv that was not there for the earlier version appletv  .

the onscreen user interface is understandable and easy to use    except for text entry which is kind of awkward with a remote  .

i'm impressed with the product so far .

this is an awesome addition to the itunes ecosystem especially if you own an iphone and/or ipod touch  .

being able to view hear content across multiple devices is the real beauty  .

i can download and begin watching a movie on my hdtv then pass it off to my laptop or iphone and continue viewing it elsewhere later  .

your content is centralized , but you can still enjoy it in multiple locations also , i now have an additional stereo system in the house thanks to airtunes plus my hdtv with surround sound highly recommended .

if the editors gave the original version of apple tv an 8  .

0 , this take two update should get at least a 12  .

0       it's just that much better  .

the available internet content has been expanded greatly , and includes  .

mac and flickr  .

the movie selection is not too bad , but i wish it would include more indie films (and probably will some day)  .

i also wish the time limit on movie rentals were at least 36 hours after first starting viewing       instead of 24 hours  .

the hd quality on my 32    inch , 720p tv is absolutely gorgeous , but people with 1080p sets will probably grouch about picture quality oh , and now you can stream audio to the atv via airtunes (as it is with airport express) , a nice , unexpected addition all in all , this update has transformed the original , ok atv into a truly extraordinary source of alternative tv content  .

great job , apple  .

i rented an hd movie last night and watched it on my 1080p 60 tv and it looked and sounded great  .

i am really glad that apple added airtunes  .

using itunes to control music for tv and main sound system is much more convenient and i still get to see album covers and track info  .

i live in an open concept home where living room , kitchen and dinning room are one big room so having the appletv for music is great  .

if my home is setup differently , like a separate home theater , i don't know if just being able to rent hd movies (i do not use youtube or photo functions) would be a good enough reason to buy an appletv .

in october 2007 we cancelled time warner b/c they continued to increase our rates without adding any new value  .

on demand selection is weak and we had to navigate through hundreds of channels to find the ones we subscribed to (this is with a mid to high level plan not basic cable)  .

hd on demand options were far worse and frequently only a few movies were available i chose the apple tv over the xbox 360 to be the entertainment hub of the house based on ease of use , price , and the theory that since i use an imac that the devices would have some degree of synergies when used together i have been very pleased with the setup one major change that makes all of this easier is the addition of good quality programming on the fox , nbc , cbs , discovery , comedy central and other websites  .

i can watch streamed tv for free on my imac or watch my movies on the big screen  .

other than a blockbuster dvd plan (about to cancel it) i have no recurring expense for tv at all  .

if i want a new release i can rent it from a dvd kiosk at the grocery store for $1 or rent it from itunes for $3 or $4 (have not rented from them yet) since the software update that allows for streaming the apple tv has become even more useful  .

the internal hard drive capacity does not really matter anymore since you can stream all of your movies and tv shows from your mac  .

previously you could stream only content that is tagged to sync so now if you have 200 movies on an external drive hooked to your computer then you have 200 movies to stream from the apple tv the picture quality is as good or better than time warner except for their hd content one final combo of features that i love is the photo slide show with music playing from my mp3 library (stored on the apple tv hard drive)  .

easily displaying photos on a big screen is a lot of fun and adds significant value to the whole package my want list includes    .

blue ray player built into apple tv  .

1080 i or p support  .

ability to watch content from any website that i want (fox , nbc , etc)  .

power saving features (apple tv is always on)  .

ability to program the remote to control the volume of my tv  .

just got an apple tv for my birthday yesterday and overall i have to say that this device works better than i expected  .

even on a slower network , streaming is almost instantaneous for movies as big as 2gb is size  .

the quality of the movies are as good as dvds (ripped with handbrake) and having hundreds of movies and home videos available at the touch of button is something else  .

no more fiddling with dvds or crowding around the computer  .

also like the youtube features , but that is huge timewaster so i will be avoiding it at all costs  .

overall a great device , i would like to see apple extend the functionality to include other applications and devices , such as the iphone (touchscreen remote) .

consumer devices that link to the internet are the future of entertainment  .

the apple tv and iphone are looking to that future , whereas sony's blueray and toshiba's hd dvd are aimed at the past  .

i make that point at my post analyzing the future of the dvd player , which you can find here    .

what i do not like about apple is that i just bought the 30gigs apple tv , and they just came out with a 160gigs one for just $100  .

00 , well i'm just going to return the 30 gigs one and get the other one .

i needed the ability to display on my 46 screen , 1  .

5tb worth of converted dvd    to    mp4 files  .

i use cucusoft's dvd    to    atv converter on a windows vista ultimate hp desktop  .

i simply plugged the power in , then the ethernet cable (my router is 2 feet away from the atv so going wireless is a waste and slower) , plugged the hdmi output to my sony av dg800 receivers tv/sat input  .

turned on my tv (set to 1080i) , and low and behold , everything is working as designed  .

i started to experiment with different output formats (e  .

, 1280x720 , 640x480) all at high/extreme quality)  .

here are the results using justice league dvd as source    .

1    1280x720 would not sync with itunes set at high    quality  .

scaled down to 50% quality (~700mb disk space) and it did sync finally  .

the orientation is 16  9 2    640x480 at high quality sync'd without prblems (set to 4  3)  .

resulting output mp4 is 1  .

2gb opinion   output quality as viewed on apple tv is excellent  .

because i set the output to be best quality on conversion , the display is near (99%) dvd quality  .

my old eyes could not tell the difference  .

for ease of use , setup , etc  .

it is worth the money spent only issue is that i can not create playlists like i can for my video ipod so , i have to spell out the full title such that it makes sense when scrolling the mneu options in atv also , tried the default sync'ing to the atv but found with my network setup , it is better to 'stream' the video from my desktop network based storage system , thus leaving about 30gb of space on the atv for those that have complained about the resolution output , get a life  .

its a combination of converter software capabilities , your tv screen ability , and how you get the videos i've decided to stay at the 640x480 hd format since i have a archos 504 and that is the max output resolution it can support  .

i could go higher with atv , but then i'd have to create two output files , one at 640 and the other at 900+  .

do not want to waste the disk space .

i just hooked it up it works great  .

i am very impressed with the easy set up  .

used component cables and toslink connected to a 50 plasma  .

is very afraid that picture would be pixelated , however very impressed .

i bought the apple tv with the goal of being able to watch videos from my computer as well as be able to listen to my music with more flexibility than i could with my airport express  .

the apple tv does all this , indeed  .

but even for a longtime techie and apple user , the interface is impressive  .

tv and av receiver manufacturers   take a cue  .

and i have found the apple tv far more useful for listening to my itunes library than i expected  .

sound is great , and downloaded video looks quite good       especially considering how quickly one can download video (or movie trailers on the apple tv itself)  .

as it stands , it is an excellent product , though the potential for growth seems almost a no    brainer  .

i'd like to be able to stream my internet radio stations , for one , and it does only seem logical that at some point one could buy movies right from this device .

the apple tv is a bit basic but has a cool design and you get what you pay for .

i just want to start up by saying that i do not get these people here who posted negative reviews without even trying this product out  .

and then they suggest getting other products that support all video formats out there or getting an xbox here's my answer    i do not want an xbox because i do not play games and i do not want a device that promises to deliver any kind of video and fails the expectations , we already have windows for that  .

apple tv is another excellent product by apple that provides great experience  .

you can encode any movie to play via apple tv that you have by using apple quicktime pro if you are looking to display your media on your tv and want great experience    get apple tv .

unlike many negative reviewers here , i own an apple tv  .

this thing works great and not limited to just itunes  .

you can use quicktime to encode any video you have to play via apple tv  .

there is even a preset for it  .

all you have to do is to open a video of your choice , click file export and select export   movie to apple tv  .

once it's been exported , add to itunes and you are ready to stream it to apple tv .

everyone is talking about the video but i bought the appletv almost 100% as an elegant music streamer to my home theater  .

and it works beautifully for that  .

now , i can navigate 50 gig + of music with a beautiful interface straight from my couch as for the harddrive size the original design didn't even have a hd b/c they wanted it to be a streamer which in a wired or n type wireless situation works at the same speed as if it were local and as for the video i have faith that dvd or near hd quality video content is in our very near future i appreciate it does not do everything , but what it does do is very slick buy it for what it does do not for what you want it to do .

i just installed my apple tv yesterday and is amazed at how cool it is  .

yes , there might be some drawbacks and yes , there are most likely things i wish it could do that it does not , but overall it's one of the greatest electronic purchases i have this product is not for everyone  .

my home audio system runs through my computer  .

however , my bonus/media room is a separate system  .

this allows me to sync my itunes library with my media room and there you have it i would recommend this to anyone who sees the future of digital media we will be downloading everything onto a main server and the tvs in the home will access it for content bottom line , i have spent more money on less worthy electronics  .

this is a great product .

apple tv does as expected  .

i am sick and tired of the poor reviews from those that bash the product , but have never even tried the apple tv  .

could it be mac envy  .

the apple tv does everything it is predicted  .

we watch movies , podcasts , tv shows , and movies  .

just got done watching the prestige in 1080 dpi  .

as for those critisizing it is only for macs  .

if you have itunes you can use apple tv  .

as for sharing movies , you can stream  .

we have multiple computers , and stream the other computers to the apple tv for those reviewing , please try the device before reviewing , especially the pc users  .

i switched to mac last year and will never turn back  .

mac works .

this is a great product to get all of your media off of your computer and stream directly to your hd television  .

you can use the media that you get from itunes and media that is not from itunes  .

i do not know where some of these reviewers are saying you are limited to only itunes you are not  .

i have imported dvd's and they work excellent no issues overall i would recommend this product and any upgrades will come through software not hardware because it has all the standard hardware hd components on the unit already .

i is going to buy a bose sound dock for $299 so my rooommate and i could share it for music in the living room from our ipods  .

for the same price , appletv allows us both to stream (in effect combine) our vast itunes libraries through the hd tv in the living room       wirelessly it took seconds to install , and it's ease of use is stunning  .

the remote is simple , just like an ipod  .

in a way , it's like getting a huge video screen for your ipod in the form of hd tv it does what it's supposed to do , and with great elegance  .

the issue i have is with reviewers that state it only works with itunes media  .

this implies it only works with media purchased through itunes  .

this is not the case  .

any items imported into itunes will work there are also issues about video quality  .

well , if you import a high quality piece of source material , it will show up in high quality  .

near dvd is an accurate statement , but as with all media (video or otherwise) , it is only as good as the source conversion  .

you just need to rip at a higher resolution for tv viewing as opposed to video ipod viewing my only reservation is that there are limited video formats recognized by the appletv at the present time  .

i suspect they removed anything buggy to get the device released , and internet    based software updates will simply add to the appletv functionality over time  .

but it's almost funny it doesn't presently play quicktime video content , considering it's an apple product but even this shortcoming is easily fixed with a $35 or less mp4 video conversion utility       easily available over the internet  .

check out c    net downloads for a few choices  .

still , i have no doubt that the video formats available through appletv will only increase over time       as will functionality like purchasing items through itunes via appletv bottom line   a fantastic item that does not increase the bulk or number of a/v items in my living room , and something everyone with a computer (and itunes) can enjoy in my household  .

brilliant work by apple  .

again  .

now if only the reviewers would be fair  .

i could not imagine a more perfect machine  .

i have waited to buy this since we first heard about it as itv  .

at the time , i is about to purchase a mac mini just to have the functions this miracle machine offers  .

but when i heard about the apple tv , which is half the cost of the cheapest mac mini , i knew i had to wait for it out of the box , this machine performs exactly as described  .

setup took less than 10 minutes , and the long part is then waiting for the first wireless sync with my imac (i have over 20 gb on itunes , and i also put my iphotos onto the apple tv)  .

once this is completed , i sat back and literally smiled for a few hours as i explored all of the features compared to my griffin ipod dock , the sound and video quality are literally amazing  .

if you have a home theater system and a computer full of itunes music , tv shows , and videos , this is what you need to have to enjoy the files on your big screen and with amazing sound quality  .

apple literally thought of everything , such as movement and screen savers to prevent burn    in on plasmas  .

the picture quality of the menus , album artwork , etc  .

is incredible  .

this is the best gui i have seen in a home theater machine i agree with cnet's review , although i must say that 90% of the drawbacks are related to itunes itself , and not a fault of the apple tv  .

this includes the quality of the video files  .

photos look simply amazing on the big screen , where the high definition really shines through  .

no more huddling around the computer for a slide show    now it's on the tv , and with any background music you have in your library  .

you can even browse through current movie trailers and watch these as well i can foresee that there might be hard drive space limitations , especially with regard to high    def content and with movie files (which i do not have in my itunes library , anyway)  .

however , you can select the items you wish to sync with the apple tv , which allows one to free up space for particular files that one might want to listen to/watch i am nothing but happy , and i would strongly encourage anyone with a home theater system , high    def tv , and an itunes library to get one  .

this product will literally change the way you do things at home .

aapletv is great  .

my seven    year    old set it up  .

hdmi cable , power cable , 5    digit code , done  .

you don't need to be a techie to set    up or use appletv  .

it works flwalessly  .

picture is clear and there is no skipping or jumping  .

apple claims that you can enjoy itunes content from up to 5 computers (mac or pc) on your widescreen tv all simply and wirelessly that is exactly what it does and it does it exceptionally well i don't give it a 10 simply because if you have content that is not on itunes yet you have to convert it  .

also , apple's movie download service is still relatively small  .

some of the negatives pointed out by cnet i do not consider negatives  .

my very expensive tv did not include cables either (what kind would you include  .

what length would you include  .

also , the included hard drvie is only meant for temporary storage , so the seemingly small capacity seems fine to me .

i hate all those people reviewing a product they don't have  .

and to anyone who said it is for macs only , learn to read  .

right on the front of the box it says mac and pc  .

this works great , all my videos look great on my 50in 768res tv  .

i understand why it does not come with cables , there are so many different ones that the box would be huge and the price would be about $100 more  .

even the videos taken with a digital tv recorder on a comp look great and they are in very low res  .

i reccomend this product for anyone who wants to have their music and videos anywhere , it's great for parties or just watching a tv show  .

i know people is going to attack any apple product  .

why  .

jealousy  .

the apple tv is an excellent media device that when it comes to meet its full potential , that is all you will ever need  .

from listenng to music to podcast , photos and movies , rentals or full dvd purchase  .

wait and see  .

if you have quicktime pro you can directly import video to apple tv  .

i love the ability to see or listen to the top music video or movie or show , just a taste of the internet connection potential of this device  .

i bet in a near future you will be able to purchase directly with the apple tv  .

be patient , wait and see .

when it arrived i opened the box plugged it into the wall and the tv and is instantly rewarded by simple prompts that i responded to using the remote  .

being used to apple products (since 1987) i did not bother with instructions  .

the only problem i encountered is remembering my network password ; however a quick visit to apple's keychain access utility solved this problem  .

the second problem is transferring about 10 gb of music , video , and photo's took awhile and i is impatient to use everything  .

i synced apple tv with my laptop because it is often closed and set up my imac to stream content  .

both tasks were very easy , just entering a code in itunes on each computer at a prompt from apple tv  .

as i type i'm listening to music moving from apple tv to my stereo tuner while a series of random photo's are moving up across my tv screen  .

watching the random selection of photo's is fun and sometimes tough to look away from  .

the slideshow feature is a great way to share images without crowding around a computer screen  .

music videos are great on the widescreen with the sound coming out of my bose 701 speakers  .

the resolution is fine as long as youre not too close to the screen  .

just to try it out , i purchased a movie at the itunes store , which is automatically transferred to apple tv then i realized it is r rated and might not be appropriate for my 11 and 14    year    old kids  .

perhaps this should not be a big deal as i have plenty of r    rated dvds on a shelf in the family room , but it would be nice if we could password protect such content  .

for all i know that ability might be available , perhaps i should peruse the manual  .

with less than 24 hours of ownership under our belts we are having allot of fun with apple tv  .

can it be improved , of course , but we bought it for what we knew it would do , and for that it's great  .

we anticipate that all of the processing power under the hood will allow a variety of capabilities to be added in the future .

cannot wait until i can afford a hd tv  .

i have tried to use my ps3 for the same features but it is nearly impossible to get mp4 videos from my imac  .

the ps3 also has music storage but is very limited and cannot play music when you change songs the apple tv changes all of this for the better  .

setup is a snap and it is easy to customize  .

all my videos can now be played while my ps3 sits idle (except for folding@home  .

while it would be nice to have hd content extended and the ability to get online , i can enjoy the apple tv for what it is  .

if i wanted more i would have bought a mac mini although i would love to have one device for everything gaming , movies , music , etc i can enjoy the apple tv for what it is .

received my appletv yesterday and haven't stop playing with it  .

my family and i have been listening to music while watching my entire iphoto album of pictures float by on my big screen tv  .

appletv creates a screen saver of all my photo , while my uploaded itunes library plays my songs  .

oh yeah , it does a nice job playing tv shows and movies too  .

i am sure most pc users wo not think it so great , but who cares , when it comes to multimedia apple is the king , and always has been .

the primary reason i bought this is to view photos without having to hover around a pc and so i did not have to tie up another pc running behind my entertainment system  .

that feature is totally awesome  .

being able to view whatever photos in a directory is beautiful  .

the only suggestion i would have is to be a little more picky in photo editing , or , rather , only keeping photos that you like to look at  .

since digital photography came out a long time ago , i've collected around 10k photos and probably one fourth of them are not really worth looking at  .

that is the beauty of digital photography , right  .

now , i'm going to have to spend a little more time cleaning them up , red    eye , ugly one's of me , etc before posting them to the my pictures directory , that gets sync'd automatically with apple tv the bonus is that while i'm playing my music photos fly by as the screen saver and it's simply terrific i'm a bit disappointed in the video quality of ripped dvds    i know's it probably the crappy software i is using , so now i'm in search of a better one  .

any suggestions  .

movie previews on itunes store appear to be in hd and are very impressive best of luck if you buy one of these .

i got this device in order to eloquently play my itunes music library in my living room through my sound system  .

i love giving my guests the little apple remote and let them select the tunes to play  .

it is up and running in 10 minutes  .

for $299 this is a great value  .

33gb is plenty of room for my itunes  .

i have no intention of using this for video  .

when there is more hd content i might be interested , but i expect to buy different hardware .

all those complaining that it can only play content purchased from itunes are completely wrong  .

i have a ton of movies which i ripped using handbrake that can be played on appletv  .

just select the mp4 format , the h264 codec , rip the movie , import it into itunes and you're done  .

it's that easy this device also gives me the ability to play music purchased on itunes on my expensive speakers and sound system in the next room  .

granted , it's only stereo (at least for now) , but that's exactly the same as what you get with standard cds  .

just turn the logic processing of your receiver on and you get a reasonable facsimile of surround sound  .

this capability saves me from having to hook up my ipod to my receiver any time i want to listen to music from it on it i also love the attractive software interface for it  .

apple products are always designed with impecable taste , though many of them are starting to look more and more the same  .

this looks exactly like my mini mac and my usb hard drive , for example , though it's thinner  .

also , for some reason , apple loves the number 300  .

for some reason , many of its hardware and software products retail for this price (not $200 or $250 , or even $275)  .

for example   logic express , final cut express , aperture , etc are all $300  .

i'm sure many other products are as well .

i've gone through quite a few of the upnp type media adapters available  .

most of them are pretty crappy engineered for engineers type products in this case i ended up being somewhat impressed    .

yes , it relies on itunes , but itunes really do work and i'm quite happy with it  .

it's what i already used 2  .

the user interface is full of animated effects and overall it is in the same class as front row concerning appearance and the rapid response  .

i would have liked to see apple's cover flow feature though and a true ipod ui level remote 3  .

the process of getting it connected to my 802  .

11n network and getting it configured with two mac minis is just unproblematic and took no significant time 4  .

the industrial design and use of materials is similar to the mac mini  .

it feels and looks expensive 5  .

the first thing you notice when you get it , is the nice packaging  .

this is all part of the overall out of box experience and should not be forgotten 6  .

well , the most important parameter of this product is that it actually works and both for video , music and photos i had no really bad experiences  .

only annoyance is that when selecting a video the device holds me up for a few seconds before i can select between resume or play from the beginning on the negative side    .

the unit got very hot and i'm a bit worried if it will die prematurely due to fast wear out of electrolytic caps for example 2  .

there is no cec support thus i wont get the benefits of this future hdmi protocol for improved ease of setup and use 3  .

1080i/1080p is not supported  .

of course higher resolution means larger files and slower downloads , but still hd with 1080 vertical resolution is what we are beginning to expect because modern displays are increasingly with that native resolution and this product will compete against ps3 with hd blueray etc .

apple tv is amazing  .

after fighting with windows media center extenders , apple tv is a joy to use  .

setup , as on almost all apple products , is simple and intuitive typically , wireless devices are fussy , especially those meant for streaming video       but the apple tv just works perfectly right out of the box  .

i expected video synced to the apple tv hard drive to play cleanly , but i cannot tell the difference between synced content and streamed content from my hp media center pc , which is connected by ethernet to an apple airport extreme 802  .

11n base station which wirelessly connects to the apple tv  .

ok , synced content starts instantly where streamed content takes about 2 seconds to start playing       but streamed content doesn't skip , stutter , develop digital artifacts or suffer from audio lag over an 802  .

11n network  .

(haven't yet tried over an 802  .

11g setup  .

) with streaming this fast , i won't worry that the onboard drive is too small be warned , however       if you have been lazy about organizing content that you've brought into itunes from outside sources , it will come back to haunt you here  .

i hadn't bothered to update the metadata attached to my converted video captured from media center when i brought it into itunes  .

(changing the default movie video identifier to tv show for example , and adding episode and season numbers in the format itunes expects to find  .

)this makes the apple tv onscreen menu structure unnecessarily busy and cluttered  .

i'm going to need to do some housecleaning in my itunes library       if i can tear myself away from the apple tv  .

setting rules for what gets synced and what does not is simple , but i wish there is more flexibility to those settings  .

maybe they will add some depth to the syncing selection options the way they did with sorting options in itunes itself recently apple tv is worth the wait and every penny i paid to get it  .

it is worth buying a new tv for  .

now all my video is in one place , and i can see anything at the click of a button on my little apple remote  .

more info always at http  //www  .

couchapple  .

for all those techies saying this is too limited , forget it , its already been hacked and now can play all formats (except that damn proprietary ms stuff  .

also trivial to upgrade the hd but you do not needs it as it streams better than anything out there .

i opened the box yesterday and 3 minutes later i is streaming video from my macbook to my tv  .

is not that what the product promised , i'm reading that picture quality is lagging or just mere standard definition , maybe people are just getting spoiled by watching movies on blue    ruy and hd    dvd  .

i read someone comparing it to vhs , thats just wrong and to bring back the memories of such is just plain mean , at worst the apple tv is dvd 480interlaced quality and at best i guess it's up to what tv you your using  .

as for me i have 2 sony kdl xbr2 1080p tv's and to be honest the upconversion on my tv's is bumping out at least 480p quality on the 1080i upconversion , as much as i love blu    ray , what ever is not out on the format i'll download from itunes and save $10  .

00 in cost and be happy with the convience of not having to go to best buy or circuit city  .

so for what i paid and what it does , the apple tv has made me happy in the two days i've been using it .

i recieved apple tv the other day and must say it just looks very impressive  .

the graphics are unbelievable  .

downloaded over 2 , 500 songs off my computer what seemed like minutes  .

pictures went over in seconds  .

sounds great on sterio in digital  .

cords are expensive cost me $35 for hdmi  .

what is usb used for because i could not hook my external hard drive to it  .

overall i would highly recommend    i use it for music library and pictures    not a movie guy  .

it does everthing i want it to do  .

i have a pc this is my first apple product    they did a great job on this solution  .

go get one its only $300 which is better then that soundbridge piece of garbage  .

roku soundbridge sucks  .

this device is a great way for me to rip my kids dvds into itunes (or buy disney movies from the store) and she can have access to them without fear of scratching the media or touching my imac i also like the music availability and easy way to push digital picture slide shows i'm a computer guy , but this little device is so easy it's silly  .

it took all of 10 minutes (8 of that is entering my wep key) to setup i wish it had a sleep mode vs being on all the time  .

i would also like to be able to rent vs buying movies with drm it should be easy to have itunes delete content once i've watched it i'd like to use the usb for additional disk space .

hard drive size   this is a 802  .

11 n wireless streaming device from your mac + pc big hard drive can use friend's laptop to share their digital media too view photos / slideshows / video podcasts / listen to music / music videos / tv / home videos quicktime will convert digital media to appletv digital older tvs  .

upgrade  .

price of flat panel hdtvs are plummeting  .

if not , then buy a video ipod plug into your tube tv watch media content that way not for everyone , just for people who want to leave their computers where they are stream media content to the tv in a very easy way with easy setup leopard mac os 10  .

5 will bring new features to itunes appletv be patient it's coming soon  .

i just want to point out that i am currently using a windows xp pc and i is very pleased with my apple tv purchase i just received my apple tv in the mail yesterday , march 22nd , 2007  .

i is very impressed with how easy the system is to hook up , connect to my existing wireless n network , and most of all , i is very impressed with how fast the apple tv synced all my media from itunes to the apple tvs 40gb hard drive the remote , while basic , really does what it is designed to do ; it allows you navigate a fully featured environment  .

i is pleased with the incredibly fast scrolling capabilities when you hold the up and down arrows the interface is beautiful  .

i is most impressed with how itunes allows me to select a separate directory for my pictures that is separate from my other media files  .

i loved how the apple tv handled my pictures through slideshows and how it used my pictures as a moving backdrop for listening to music last night i ended up converting 10 youtube files from    .

flv to    .

mp4 with my youtube to ipod converter  .

it took a couple minutes per clip  .

i merged the files together with quicktime ; which is seamless  .

it took about a minute to save the file and put it in my itunes library  .

in seconds , i is watching that clip , which i created from youtube content , on my 50 tv ; it had already synced with my apple tv  .

wow  .

after looking at the reviews on cnet , it would seem that the vast majority are people without an apple tv , so it's ratings is lower than it should be  .

there are also alot of videogames xbox fanboys in here that really just want to malign apple's media center entry now , on to my review  .

i received my apple tv yesterday and it is a snap to set up  .

very easy , just plugged it in and connected an hdmi cable  .

which are cheap , only $20 from apple  .

com  .

picture quality on my tv is good  .

not quite full dvd , but for a picture that had been used up till now for ipods and a home computer , it looked quite good i watched some of 24 and 30 rock  .

which looked good on my tv  .

i then tried out listening to my music collection  .

here the apple tv shined  .

one word of advice , if you own cd's import into itunes at a higher bitrate than the default 128  .

your music will sound way better  .

music bought on itunes will sound decent , but if you actually own a cd it will sound great all in all , this is an excellent new device , i just hope apple starts selling 720p versions of the content so we can see the apple tv reach its full potential .

your review fotgot to mention that the latest quiktime update has a new feature   export to apple tv  .

if you open a divx file with quicktime (with the correct plug    in) , you can export it .

i love the appletv not because its apple or because it 'just looks so cool' , but because it is incredibly convenient for my usage in our house , some people like full house (ugh ) , some seinfeld , sex and the city , house md , south park , the simpsons , ect  .

ect  .

after i got sick of the atrocious way my dad handled putting varaiety in what we watched (burning 'mix    dvds' i said we should just buy a big hard drive , connect it to our 'free pc' (mac mini) and store all the media we want there he eventually went for it , and we bought an apple tv so we could watch it on the bigger tv's  .

it's great and so incredibly convenient anything ripped from a dvd (that's what most of our files are) look great , but the south park episodes i got off itunes look terrible on a 52 hdtv .

i've been reading the reviews and i'm ashamed of pc and mac users alike  .

9% of the reviews of people who don't own or use the itv  .

why are you reviewing  .

a couple of tivo comparisons were made by an ignorant jackass who doesn't know a dvr (tv program recorder) from a media extender type product that streams media from a computer system , just like the xbox 360 , which is also a media center extender and requires zune to work    these are not media centers  .

if a device takes direct television signals , it's a dvr    itv only takes digital media from a computer or other storage device and displays it on a tv  .

why is that so hard to understand  .

others have condemned the itv due it's lack of divx and support for other formats  .

does microsoft windows media center edition offer support for divx or other formats  .

even ps3 owners are not happy with the media experience , so nobody is a winner on this one  .

every company seems to be sticking with their proprietary formats , so cry about all the products and review them as you will , but rate them equally also , what's the big deal about the small internal hard drive  .

this is , as i've stated already , not a media center  .

you have to use a computer to stream the media to the itv , so why would they put a 1tb drive in it and bump the price up to over $1 , 000  .

that's rediculous when you can attach 5 external hard disks to your computer system via usb and store the same amount of data for half the price  .

it's not a storage solution , people    it's a media extender that streams music , pictures and movies to your tv from your computer system (s) and attached storage devices i'm sick of reading reviews by people who are either against all apple products or who are too ignorant to understand what a product does  .

this is why our country is a joke because the education levels are so low that people cannot understand what products do and slam them without owning or using them or they're just too damn lazy to read (maybe they cannot) the tech specs this is a great product and for those who bought it after reading and learning about it , you will also be pleased with it's performance as i am  .

have a great day .

yes , this product has its limitations however it does mostly what i would like it to do which is to access my music , videos and pictures from both my mac and pc (which is located in another room upstairs)  .

i even considered buying a mac mini to accomplish this utilizing the networking features , etc , however the apple tv is a cheaper alternative  .

i am not sure if some of you have seen the front row application on the newer macs , but it has the cleanest and coolest interface i have seen  .

i do wish the apple tv had a larger hard drive , but i am anticipating that apple will offer the ability to add external stackable drives which look similar and do not sacrifice the cool look of the apple tv .

this has not even came out yet so people should not say this sucks  .

wait till it comes out then say what you think  .

this is an excellent product but i believe it will only be appreciated by those who already use itunes , and/or also uses other apple products like ipod or iphone  .

if that's you , you will love this product its a must have .

so originally i bought this so i could just listen to my itunes library , which included tv shows and movies i bought ; on my tv and really nice surround sound system  .

heres my story    .

one day i is just sitting there and thinking how nice itd be never to put another dvd into my dvd player  .

i is messing around with a couple solutions , including converting my dvds for play back on my 360 , but ive never been a huge fan of the  .

wmv file format  .

the quality is horrible and it wont support huge files (360) , another big turn off so i decided that i would give the appletv a try  .

to my amazement , it supported a good quality (not as high as i would have liked) conversion from my dvds  .

i quickly became aware that the apple tvs hard drive wont support my new needs for mass storage  .

so i bought an external hard drive for my computer and stored my movies on there and stream them to my appletv  .

now i know this isnt what i wanted to begin with , but the solution works great  .

no problems , streaming occurs fast , and it caches the movie im watching more storage please    .

what would be nice for the appletv of the future  .

higher bit rate for files , larger file support , at least 1tb hard drive (seriously 40 or 160          weak  .

) , and an easy solution for the masses to convert there dvds for appletv bottom line    .

if you want itunes like interface through your home theater system and have movies youd like to digitize , then appletv is one of the best solutions ive used  .

itll bring your current itunes library to your home theater system , plus its looking as if apple is trying to position its self as a digital movie renter for the masses  .

well see if they actually gain titles and studios to back that initiative  .

im impressed with this product thus far  .

have had the apple tv almost since day 1 and it saw limited use , basically for friends to see videos and photos  .

they are more willing to look at the tv than a computer  .

but , with the release of movie rentals it is now an awesome addition to my ht  .

i loved the selections and expect they will expand greatly  .

go apple  .

just wanted to correct the reviewer's statement about apple tv not supporting internet radio  .

it , in fact , does  .

however , you cannot choose the radio stream from within the apple tv  .

you do need itunes to do this all you have to do is drag radio stations to the playlist and sync the playlist to the apple tv  .

you can then listen to the streams from under the my music menu for more information , please visit apple tv source at  .

http  //appletvsource  .

com  .

let me be the first to congratulate steve jobs on the upgrade of appletv product  .

i received the release today (around 11  00 cet) , and i spent the day playing with my new toy the interface is much changed  .

not quite so simple as were accustomed , but still intuitive  .

theres really only 2 new features   but they transform the products value  .

1) direct interface to itunes store , and 2) movie rentals the itunes store on tv works well  .

i had some trouble accessing my itunes account , so i had to create a new account on the pc , then reconnect  .

not terribly difficult or time consuming  .

once in , everything worked like a charm  .

buying a song on tv simultaneously downloads it to my pc and appletv see the full review at http  //www  .

broodingsavage  .

com/journal/2008/2/13/appletv    upgrade    is    here    review  .

html  .

reply tags   appletv , itunes , movies , tv  .

first off , i own one  .

i dont understand why someone would review something they dont own  .

second , its the only apple product i own so im hardly an apple fanatic  .

i purchased it because i needed some way to stream my itunes music library to my stereo  .

i had previously used a tivo box , which is unreliable to say the least  .

after researching various products i decided to go with apple tv because of the nice interface and seamless integration with itunes  .

the price is similar and often times less than competing products i read lots or reviews (non    owners of course) saying this is only good for buying itunes content  .

this just isnt the case  .

i use itunes as my music manager but i do not purchase music or movies from the itunes store  .

until the store goes drm free they will not get my business  .

also , i dont understand who would pay 15 bucks for a downloaded movie  .

there are rumblings that the itunes store will start renting movies  .

if this happens apple tv owners will have a great added feature and maybe then i would start using the itunes store  .

ive added about 15 movies to my apple tv library by encoding them in high definition from my existing dvds with free software i downloaded from the internet  .

i have a 42 hdtv and the movies look great on it  .

i only wish the apple tv had 5  .

1 dolby digital support enabled on the apple tv box if you hate itunes or dont rip your cds into  .

mp3 format then this is not the media server for you  .

i switched from using windows media player to itunes a few years ago and my cds are all ripped into  .

mp3 format so this is not an issue for me i would spend the extra money and get the 140 gig model  .

then youll have plenty of room for your media and any future upgrades apple makes to the software .

i picked this thing up as a product i knew i would not use 24/7 (in contrast to a dvr/cable box)  .

but is does serve it's purpose well as advertised simply a hard    drive with an os and wifi enabled for transfers .

apple has the right idea here    it's a streamlined system that really helps integrate technology here are some of my points    .

1) i've heard lots of complaints about not being able to download content directly to the apple tv  .

i don't understand what's so hard about downloading stuff into itunes on your computer  .

to be honest , i prefer to have all my content in one repository anyway  .

it's easier to back up  .

plus , i can decide where i want to view it (my computer , my ipod , or my apple tv) 2) i like that it plays music  .

i've removed the stereo from my living room  .

who needs it  .

i just use the apple tv and play any of the songs from my itunes library  .

no cd's to load/unload  .

that's a nice feature to me 3) i love that it has wi    fi built in  .

it is simple enough to configure  .

i have a replaytv in one room and the wireless router in the other  .

i had to buy a little wireless bridge to get it to work (the apartments i live in don't allow me to punch holes in the wall to have wired ethernet) 4) i've also heard the complaints that it doesn't record shows  .

i do not really want my apple tv to be a dvr  .

i've already got a couple of different dvrs (moxi box from cable company , replaytv and eyetv)  .

i use the eyetv (http  //www  .

elgato  .

com)    which is a dvr on my mac  .

there's a little ipod button that allows me to convert/export the shows i record into itunes (in h  .

264 format)    and then to my video ipod  .

very clever  .

well a couple of weeks ago a new apple tv icon showed up that lets me convert/export an mpeg4 file into itunes  .

that's nice  .

now , i can not only buy content from itunes , but i can import content from my dvr  .

i'm sure i could download the content from my replaytv (using dvarchive) and import it as well    that would be a little redundant    but it would let me archive programs in itunes 5) i would like to see apple update it to have support for 5  .

1 or 7  .

1 surround sound    after all    that's part of the home theater experience 6) also , support for 1080i/p should be added  .

there will be hd content coming soon  .

even if the wi    fi 802  .

11g/n cannot keep up with the speed that hd content streams    gigabit ethernet will 7) one more con if you have wpa set up    it's very difficult to enter a strong encryption key    like steve gibson recommends (http  //www  .

grc  .

com)    because you have to use the little remote to move around a visual keyboard  .

apple should support plugging in a usb keyboard to the usb port    and letting you type that in i generally like the apple tv    and think it's the closest thing to having a truly integrated computer and home theater system  .

i've used other technology to extend the reach of the apple tv  .

i think those nay    sayers might be surprised to learn that there are numerous ways to get content onto the apple tv other than just itunes  .

i bet someone will be able to rip their dvd's and convert/import them into itunes to be able to play on the apple tv as well  .

i'm sure the software must be out there .

i've had my appletv for about a week now and i'm having a lot of fun with it  .

it play's all the movies on my imac and macbook (after converting formats , which kinda sucks but i do not mind) without issues , cool menus , and overall just fun to play with  .

the itunes store will eventually have movies for download in 720p but for now i'm getting most of my stuff from torrent files and ripping dvd's  .

there are definately some flaws with the appletv like the small hard drive but i just dont let my computer sync with it so it's always streaming instead  .

with my external hard drive , i can easily take that , my appletv and my macbook anywhere i go and have a huge library of movies and tv shows at my fingertips .

a few people have been going off about the slingcatcher and how it will destroy the apple tv  .

first off you have to note that slingcatcher will not stream hd  .

also yes its $200 but thats without a hard drive  .

on the apple tv you get a hard drive and you get native 1080i support , oh and guess what you can stream that off of your computer  .

sorry slingcatcher is a wanna be that has yet to show its stuff  .

ill stick with the appletv .

i love this device , but you have to know what it can do and what it cannot  .

it basically will let you watch or listen to anything you have in itunes  .

if you buy it for this purpose , it works great  .

menus are easy , the slide show feature is fabulous  .

but it wo not stream ripped dvds unless they have been converted to h  .

264 (mp4) format first  .

i have found the program handbrake does this well  .

the video quality is also not true hd quality , and this is a let down , but i anticipate that apple will be changing this soon  .

all in all , really happy with the purchase and i would recommend it  .

after reading multiple reviews on this product i decided to puchase the apple tv this past weekend i have been using a g4 mac mini for the past 2 years as media server and front row media device , i will start with my experiences prior to the apple tv first the g4 mac mini has worked flawlessly as a front row media device in my home theater connected to a dlp overhead projector via vga connection looped through a scan converter  .

video is acceptable through this setup , but once scan convereted to composite and modulated in stereo the quality is suffering on other tv's in my home  .

the only solution for good quality on another hd set in my home is to connect my macbook pro via dvi    hdmi cable then share my connected volumes to the macbook pros front row interface , as you can see , this is far more work than most people would be willing to do and i didn't like the idea of dedicating my macbook pro for this use and spending $600 on a dedicated mac mini for this purpose is out of the question enter the apple tv  .

once i arrived home with the apple tv i had it up and running within 15 minutes once i configured my airport extreme to allow the apple tv's mac address due to security  .

when i entered the apple tv provided password into the mac mini's itunes i had access to the 300gb+ of mpeg4 content and 100gb of mp3 content connected to the mac mini and is able to stream content almost immediately  .

i have convereted the majority of my mpeg    4 video at 480xxxx for playback on remote computers and ipod video  .

i is very pleased to see how the apple tv upconverted the content on my toshiba 65 hd set at 1080i  .

to my eye my converted library of video is just shy of sd content on directv which is acceptable for casual tv viewing on the same set  .

i downloaded a few trailers via the apple tv and is amazed at how good they looked in comparison to my mpeg    4 content  .

trailers looked so close to dvd quality at times i could have been fooled had i not known it is coming from the apple tv the majority of content in mpeg    4 in my library as i said earlier is compressed as single pass at 480xxxx 1000kbps data rate yielding sd quality in most cases  .

640xxxx or 720xxxx content at 1700kbps data rate is dvd quality in most cases when viewed back on the apple tv via the same tv  .

i have yet to convert my library to h264 which will yield better results at the same data rate due to wanting the capability of playback on legacy devices  .

all video content has been converted to mpeg    4 using handbrake , not quicktimepro mpeg    4 to sum up video on the apple tv , what you see on the tv via apple tv is only as good as what you have provided it , so the arguments that the apple tv playback quality is horrid are groundless , recompress your own dvd's and do not use torrented video as a guage of apple tv's playback quality  .

it all comes down to how large you want your files to be , how much time you want to devote to conversion and how much hard drive space you are willing to spare music playback is superb and much easier to navigate than front row  .

the one drawback as mentioned before in the review and in this thread is the lack of audiobooks and unfortunately no internet radio streams  .

(we can only hope for these features in a future update)  .

itunes must be launched and running on the computer that is streaming content to the apple tv so unfortunately any connected volumes to the host computer will not fully spin down while itunes is open  .

make sure to quit itunes on the host computer so your hard drives will not stay continually active when you are not accessing them  .

this leads to the problem that the apple tv will not force the host computer to launch itunes like front row does , leaving you to manually launch itunes whenever you want to stream content to the apple tv  .

when using a headless computer for media serving you may want to have vnc software installed on it so you can manually start and quit itunes remotely if you are considering this product , do your homework , read reviews (ars has a very detailed and objective review on their site) and feed the apple tv good quality content and remember , what's been optomized for your ipods screen will not look the same on a large hd set 500    700kbps 320xxxx looks great on the ipods screen 1500    2000kbps 640xxxx or 720xxxx is recommended for near dvd quality on an hd set i hope the additional info i have provided in this post will help answer some of the questions .

anyone who's giving this device a score of 5 or less simply hasn't used one , and really has a set of problems with apple that has nothing to do with this product for example , it does play content that was not purchased via itunes  .

i've got dozens of home movies , television shows and other content that is not purchased through the itunes store but that plays through the itunes player and works perfectly on apple tv  .

the one exception is my audible library of audio books  .

in this instance some of the content works but the majority doesn't  .

luckily , however , i didn't buy apple tv to listen to my audio books through my television  .

i did buy it to watch movies , television shots , my photos and listen to music whereever i want to in my house , without wires and in a way that is simple enough for everyone in my family (not just the gearheads) to use  .

for this , apple tv works perfectly if you're the kind of person who builds your own desktop and likes to play with wires and boxes , then this probably is not for you  .

but if you like products that create a joy    of    use experience right out of the box (heck , even in the act of opening the box) , then you might want to check out apple tv at an apple store , rather than read another review on here  .

see for yourself  .

my guess is that you wo not be disappointed p  .

for those who complain about the lack of 4  3 compatibility , or composite inputs , i can only say that apple's never been about backwards compatibilty with inferior technologies or standards  .

some may see that as a limitation  .

i see it as a strength of apple's   go where the puck will be , not where it is  .

remember , they're the company that removed the floppy drive from their computers far in advance of other manufacturers  .

when's the last time you used a floppy drive  .

so the apple tv is very very good at what it can do right now  .

that is mostly streaming and transfer itunes content around your home network to the tv  .

but it is lacking in legallly available high def content  .

near dvd quality means sub dvd quality  .

and yes , do not expect surround sound just yet  .

but one can only surmise that hd content is on its way  .

for me , i've been trying to figure how to get my music content in to my living room  .

i is using the dlo homedock deluxe , but the atv blows it away  .

the definition of the cover art and on screen photos is simply great  .

but this is a first generation product and it is not a dvr and it is not a high def delivery system (yet)  .

if you have some patience and can wait for this to evolve , this is a superb device  .

i'm pleased with the purchase .

i need everything it does and it does each of those things with ease and elegance i replaced my aging squeezebox with apple tv and i could not be happier since it has a better interface , is more reliable , and can play itunes protected content photos are a bonus for me  .

no one in my house can resist stopping in front of the slideshow screensaver with families snapshots taken over the last 12 years we've watched some video on it , but it's more of a novelty or a fall    back than a realistic substitute for a dvd player or hd cable  .

480p ought to be adequate , though , i suspect it is less the hardware and more the format of the material from itunes that is at issue  .

hopefully that will improve with time also , i wish i could show my imovie content without extra work check out my blog for a blow    by    blow of setting it up and using it http  //www  .

html  .

ignore all of the reviews by people who do not have one  .

it instantly       and securely       pours anything your itunes can hold into your tv with an hd interface (up to 1080i)  .

videos on itunes must be in the apple tv compression format for hd , meaning 720 x 1280 max , but conversion looks impressive  .

movies , oddly enough , cannot be looped in v1  .

there goes the kiosk market  .

music can  .

files on itunes in acc and uncompressed aiff can be moved to it for ultra    hi    fi playback  .

wishes   instant looped movie files , the way they can be in the itunes on my computer  .

better screen saver options  .

1080i program streaming  .

wider web access  .

and an oddity   the apple remote triggers my ir hi fi  .

how about a narrow beam model , perhaps with a laser pointer targeter  .

side note   apple tv is much better implemented than this review/opinion feature on cnet , which omits its preview/submit abilities through the nyt page on both safari and firefox  .

just saying    inova  .

i got my apple tv 2 days ago and definitely not regretting it  .

i love everything about it , yeah the video quality could be a little better when watching movies bought from itunes but i don't think the problem is really that bad (even the stuff i downloaded from youtube (do not ask me how i did that) looks acceptable on apple tv and thats saying a lot)  .

my favorite thing about apple tv would probably be the photo viewing , the photos look great when viewed through apple tv  .

i really recommend apple tv for anyone looking for an easy way to get all your media from your computer to your tv .

first off   i own it , so i think i'm in a good position to write a review to it let's start with the major complaint made elsewhere   the inability to play divx content  .

i don't consider this the major problem  .

why  .

i have a 1080i hd tv and , even if they are good , divx still suck compared to analog tv quality  .

i actually converted one with quicktime in appletv format and it deceived me  .

i didn't spend money to whatch movies in you tube like quality on my tv  .

so i reverted to handbrake and converted dvds  .

that's what it should look like the harddisk drive is a little small , but not such a drawback that prevents me from being perfectly happy with the purchase  .

i can store enough content to watch it for an evening an listend to music for a whole day  .

when i have seen a show , it actually gets canceled and the new one is sync    ed instead  .

so no problem there the menu is absolutely gorgeous  .

i don't have an expensive satellite subscription for hd tv content , so it actually (besides home movies shot with sony handycam high def) is the first time i have real hd content on my hd tv  .

no matter how i put it , but that alone makes the purchase worth  .

(here i am talking about the menu , the interface , the cover flow , picture slideshow , but not movies or tv shows) i hope , or better said , expect apple to sell video content online in europe (switzerland) sometimes soon  .

because that would make a difference apple tv   who is it for  .

people who don't have very high end audio systems , but nevertheless want to enjoy music from their living room  .

people who are sick and tired (in europe) of general tv and don't want to spend a fortune on some satellite or cable subscription (it would help , as said , that apple releases content to buy here too , until then i'll stick to backed up dvds and converted divxs)  .

people who want a home media hub but cannot affort to spend twice or three times as much for a full fledged pc (and consume a fair play licence to listen to itunes purchased content) apple tv gets warm (not hot) if used for a longer time (i is syncing and , at the same time , watching or listening)  .

but it stays absolutely quiet with no fans whatosever dolby 5  .

1 would have been great , but the virtual dolby (as said , it's for people who don't want very high end) works surprisingly well (at least on my set up) all in all , very well spent money , also for a european who has not , yet , the ability to purchase video content online .

is this the end all and be all for your home theater  .

however if you want to turn your home theater into basically a giant video ipod (with the pros and cons of that) then this is obviously the right product  .

my impressions so far (based off 4 days of ownership)    .

two gripes first    .

) hard drive is too small  .

the idea is to sync with your itunes library and copy your movies , tv shows , music , and then photos in that order until you run out of space  .

given that the newer tv shows on itunes are getting to be pretty large , it fills up fast  .

it really makes no sense to me given that the latest video ipod has a hard drive basically twice the size of the appletv , but this alone is not a dealbreaker as the ability to stream content from your itunes works just as well 2  .

) limited content  .

you are pretty reliant on itunes for your content , however the appletv can play recorded shows using tivo desktop and converting the files for use with the ipod , although i haven't convinced myself why i want to do that  .

also , i have several audiobooks from audible  .

com and although they play great on my ipod , it is not a supported format for the appletv , although audiobooks purchased from itunes play fine the good stuff    .

) setup is easy 2  .

) interface is great , able to navigate songs/shows/etc very easily  .

i've tried using my denon receiver to browse my networked music as well as a connected ipod plus have used the xbox 360 with both a media sharing pc and a media center pc and this is by far the best  .

however i did just notice that orb  .

com will now connect with wii/ps3/xbox 360 , and that could give some serious competition if you already have one of those systems 3  .

) my wife likes it  .

the easier it is to use , the more she likes it , so that might be the biggest selling point if you are going to be sharing it with other who might be a little tech savvy 4  .

) can control it with a universal remote  .

i is able to get my harmony remote to control it just as well as the apple remote , which is good because it is so small i am bound to lose it soon  .

i would not normally mention this as a plus but given the fact that the ps3 cannot be controlled by a universal remote is irritating .

the first thing i want to make clear is i got this unit mainly to listen to my cd catalog on my pc  .

i have over 5 , 000 songs there and counting  .

i will use the video and picture options later but its main purpose is to listen to my music  .

for that purpose this unit is exceptional  .

its my third attempt at this type of hardware  .

both the squeezebox 3 and digital dj were very quirky  .

very hard to get it to work the same way two consecutive times  .

they were returned in favor of the apple tv  .

it is a snap to setup for one  .

it worked immediately and each time afterwards  .

my audio setup is high end and any sound degradation is very easy to hear  .

i have used my ipod a few times and the compression is easily noticeable  .

using apple lossless is the trick  .

cd quality sound  .

the problems with the other units is the software  .

no problems with the apple tv , although the other units were said to be made to work with itunes , the apple tv says it too and they are right  .

it works seemlessly  .

also really like the picture interface with the album artwork yes i am one very happy customer  .

i have listened to more music in the past 3 days than i have in the last 3 months  .

the only drawback so far is that logitechs music dj allowed you to make a playlist on the fly which you cannot do on the apple tv .

this product is unbelievable  .

never had anything install so quicly and flawlessly  .

syncing worked great and photos look great on tv  .

movies , tv shows worked fine  .

great addition to anyones home a/v system  .

now apple just needs to get more movie content in their itunes store  .

this is a good first step because the future is not about the technology , it is about the ui and that is all apple is trying to do this year  .

this device is an ipod for the living room  .

it does not replace tivo or netflix because it is not meant to  .

it puts the media on your pc onto your tv and does so elegantly if not comprehensively  .

that is apple's mo    do the ui correctly and then work on content/drm/partnerships , etc  .

unlike ms which tries to button up everything first and later work on the ui .

first off       i could care less about drm arguments and the like  .

i have been an itunes/ipod user for years and don't feel one bit restricted by fairplay or any of the other 'evil controls that supposedly limit use of content  .

aac compression and compressed video that don't show artifacts are just fine in my book  .

i'm not a purist       i don't need lossless audio and the like this device is a piece of apple's vision for media  .

if you're a purist and don't buy into that vision , then pass on apple tv  .

you'll just be frustrated because you cannot make the device do what you think it should do for you non    purists (like me) that use itunes as your primary media app/manager , i think apple tv is a great little box  .

the initial content sync with itunes takes a while and i found that it is better to let the content all sync up before doing anything serious with the box i am in the process of ripping my dvds using h  .

264 and imho , the picture quality on my hdtv , using hdmi through apple tv is great  .

my rips are 1    2gb , so yeah , that only let's apple tv store about 15    20 movies locally , but who cares  .

the point is that i can access all of my content through apple tv  .

itunes , where ever you have it installed , is the media library , not the apple tv to be fair       i've never bought a movie from itms , so i do not know what the quality it like  .

however , from looking at apple's own forums and based on the content i have purchased       some content being sold is not big screen friendly at all  .

apple needs to step up the quality of the content that is being offered  .

as an example , the itunes movie trailers that you can access for free look great , but the few pieces of tv content i own look awful (too compressed , lots of pixelation)  .

this makes sense since most of the stuff is intended to be watched on a ipod , but on the big screen , well , you get the picture (no pun intended  .

) bottom line   if you use itunes as a media app , and know how to get your dvds into an itunes friendly format , apple tv is pretty neat  .

if you're a purist and worry about the fact that apple is trying to control your life and that you cannot use itunes content elsewhere , then pass on it until microsoft or somebody else comes up with a better mousetrap .

i get so tired of techie reviewers saying things like you can mod your xbox , get a sling this and upgrade the firmware etc  .

the vast majority of people do not in nay way want to wade through technical problems or find it enjoyable  .

they want to turn it on and watch and listen to their stuff  .

millions of people use itunes because they see something , buy it and listen or watch it  .

they do not give a damn what format  .

apple tv is made for the consumer market , not the geek who wants to build his own device .

we bought it yesterday from the apple store and immediately got home and set it up  .

just as everyone else has already said a million times , it is a very simple set up  .

literally plug in the hdmi cable , plug in the power , enter the password for your network , enter the passcode on your itunes from the apple tv , and you are off  .

it takes a few minutes to download the content (depending on what you want)to the apple tv once the set up is done , using it is real easy  .

we have a 50 plasma and noticed shows from apple (like heros)looks really good where as some shows i've converted from xp media center using mytvtogo as well as some of my dvds using ipod media studio show a bit fuzzy  .

i'm guessing because they are so compressed and were never designed to be used on a 50 tv  .

enhanced video podcasts also look pretty good there is an output for optical audio that we use so its convenient just to run that through our receiver and listen to whatever music is in our itunes i will say that pictures look really good on the tv if you are into looking at slideshows of your home pics  .

i never thought i is but the apple tv adds music to the slideshow and it looks pretty cool i don't think there is anything else that i can add that hasn't been said  .

they (apple) never said it is the end all for all things media but it does work pretty well and i really do not have anything bad to say  .

would i buy it again or recommend it to a friend  .

if that person used itunes as much as i do definitely .

i is walking by an apple store yesterday , and on impulse decided to pick one of these up  .

which seems to put me ahead of most of the reviews i've read on here    why are people reviewing this box that haven't actually used it  .

the setup process is simplicity itself  .

plug it in to your tv (i used component cables , because i had no spare hdmi cable handy) , your receiver (i used optical audio cables but of course , you can use regular rca jacks should you so desire , or hdmi) , and power  .

it turns on automatically (no power switch)  .

it asks you to choose your language and resolution , and then all you do is open itunes on your computer and type in the number it tells you to type in  .

that's it  .

it starts automatically syncing  .

whenever you play something , it will reduce the bandwith it's using for the sync , or stop it i'm on an 802  .

11g network , not 802  .

11n , but everything seems to work well  .

there's a few problems i've noticed though    .

first the annoying and easy stuff    .

though i imagine most people will use wireless networks , why has apple not included gige on a box like this , that sync's large amounts of data  .

hard drive size , of course , is low 3  .

this is a big one    the remote causes the macbook's in my apartment to do things , when i'm trying to use the appletv 4  .

and of course , last but certainly not least , it only supports video that you can put into itunes  .

this means , more or less , h  .

264 with an mp4 wrapper  .

most of my video is divx/avi now , there is a (theoretically    i've only tested one way , and had limited success) simple way around this , though it is not particularly elegant  .

quicktime pro allows for 2 options that could work  .

first , simply open the video and click save as and you can save it as a  .

mov  .

this allows the video to be loaded into itunes , and only took a couple seconds  .

unfortunately , it still didn't want to sync to the appletv , for some reason i haven't figured out  .

the second way is to go to export    to appletv  .

this i have not fully tested , but it seems to take quite a while , though i'm sure it'd work  .

the first way is obviously superior , if it can be made to work in short , it's definitely first generation hardware but for all that , it is a nice box , and at least so far , i do not regret buying it .

i wish reviewers would get the facts straight before they write a review you can hook an appletv to a non widescreen tv if you purchase an optional apple dvi to s    video/composite video adapter for $19  .

you then go hdmi    dvi    svideo/composite you can put anything into itunes even if they do not officially sell it you can use handbrake on your dvd's and convert them into mpeg4 and import them  .

you can download avi files and either convert them via sharware like isquint into mpeg4 or by opening the avi file in quicktime you can make an alias or shortcut to your avi and then put that shortcut into your itunes library and it will play an avi file with no modifications whatsoever and who wants to watch youtube video , talk about crap video quality  .

all signs point to 720p video coming to itunes very soon  .

you'll need a fast connection to download in a reasonable amout of time this thing is not perfect nor can it do everything if you want something that can do everything then purchase a mac mini for $300 more  .

then you can do what ever you want , play whatever you want and even add an eyetv dvr .

appletv has a lot going for itself  .

apple's goal is to simply offer its millions of itunes customers an opportunity to bring the itunes content trapped in their ipods and pcs to their home entertainment systems  .

and for that i truly believe this product delivers like the overall form factor , the onscreen menu is very slick and easy to navigate in typical apple fashion  .

setup is painless  .

i got up and running in minutes my biggest issue is the fact that video quality is poor , but that is an itunes issue , not appletv  .

i'd have to expect apple to address this issue by making hd video content available soon  .

in a way i feel almost misled because all of the press releases suggested video playback to be upconverted to 720p hd , which is probably true , but the video quality is unfortunately optimized for the little video ipod screen  .

that being said , sync'd photos and album art look stunning , however if i could make any recommendations about the actual product itself , i would increase the harddrive capacity (i'd even pay extra for that) and/or allow for exandability with the usb port  .

also , i'd like more custom menu/display options       colors , screensavers , how photo/album art is diplayed , etc the price point i think is fair if you're looking at the overall package and not just the $/megabytes  .

i'm sure they'll make some improvements in future models , but this version is worth checking out  .

especially when you can download hd content on itunes .

well , contrary to the post above (the dude that rated this piece of hardware twice with a 1) i think it is genius that it does not have a tv tuner  .

especially for ppl  .

that are located in countries where u need to pay a monthly fee if u have a tv    set or anything that can receive tv  .

so you can just plug your lcd or similar in and voila  .

depending on how itunes dependant it will be this thing might replace my xbox which i currently use to watch movies from the pc since it will be obsolete once higher definition movies are available there are similar solution available but with a similar price tag and probably not as versatile as this apple tv .

appletv is easy to use , i whish it had a turn    off switch , unit is always iron    hot to the touch  .

do not understand why the songs in appletv playlists are not always in the same order as my itunes playlists in my computer  .

listening to music is what i use it most , i'm glad sounds much better than the ipod i had connected to my system before .

i gave this a better star rating today than i would have a year ago when i first got the unit  .

apple has certainly improved the firmware/os these past several months  .

the hd performance is very good and selections are improving with each passing day  .

a digital video unit like this is certainly the future when it comes to home movie rentals and viewing  .

all in all , i'm happy with the apple tv but it was not always the case pro's   ease of renting and buying movies thru itunes  .

selections are growing ever better with each month  .

now being able to buy and archive hd movies is a very nice option  .

i have not been to a video store in maybe a year and that's a good thing  .

picture quality is generally quite good cons   still a little pricey @ $249 for entry level 40gb  .

ridiculous 24hr time limit and 30 day limit on rentals thru itunes  .

useless remote  .

the biggest downside to the atv is it must have a 6mb/s hi    speed connection or better  .

i had a 3mb dsl connection and it took an hour or more to download an hd rental rendering the convenience of the device largely non    existent  .

improvements to streaming capability did improve this but it is still not what it should be  .

i upgraded recently to a 10mb connection and it's much much improved  .

but this is still not a viable option for most people and imho will yet hinder sales of the atv  .

apple also needs to improve the options the user has for storage and transference of purchased movies , etc  .

warning you cannot download a purchased movie directly to the atv and move it between your desktop/laptop for storage  .

it stays on the atv , not exactly useful if you're building a collection  .

finally , if you use a physical firewall to protect your network , you can run into issues with antivirus and antispy blocking itunes traffic selectively  .

getting support for this issue is non    existent  .

(admittedly this is not apple's issue but still worth mentioning as it can quickly grow outside the average joe's networking and technical ability  .

all in all my family and i very much like the apple tv and with the 10mbs connection it's much more convenient and certainly beats trips to the video store  .

with the price of bluray players not coming down and bluray movies still rather expensive the atv and it's cousins appear to be the future and the survival of bluray is not for certain  .

however , i would like to see apple and itunes be less restrictive with their terms of usage especially when it comes to rentals  .

24 hours once you start a movie is absurd and not in    line with rental industry standards  .

it should be more like 3    5 days similar to blockbuster/hollywood  .

in addition , a 30 day time limit is flat out ridiculous  .

if i rent a movie or a group of movies it should be my choice as to when i want to watch them whether it's right now or 6 months from now  .

clearly it's a digital copy and not a physical disc we're talking about , thus apple/itunes are not out anything if the movie sits indefinitely on your dvp  .

movie stores have inventory concerns and so a time limit is a necessity , not so with itunes  .

why this restriction on atv  .

improvements i'd like to see include 1080i/p support , the ability to store movies using a usb device like an hdd or thumb drive rather than syncing thru my wifi network (very , very slow even with draft    n)  .

more flexibility for movement and storage of movies in general .

i like apple's innovation  .

are their products perfect  .

are they nifty and pretty  .

yes i support apple in the midst of mega hardware/software/search corp politics  .

apple's creativity and attempt at neutrality , has served them well history lesson    early 90's attempted a platform which would run on windows , etc  .

there is an 'open source' period  .

no takers , so mac did their own thing  .

who but apple is not in these patent battles  .

i would buy for ex their ipod over other mps , even if the others packed more for the price if you think your laptop , mp3 , video player is good , hack it  .

see how many rootkit hooks you find  .

then choose honesty over evil laura  .

i will try and keep this link up to date with my findings as i go http  //www  .

999reasons  .

com/content/view/71/65/  .

i picked one of these up at circuit city in ann arbor on wednesday  .

so far , i have loaded and watched itunes store movies (so    so quality on the 42 plasma) , music (good sound) and photos (excellent quality on the plasma with plenty of slideshow options)  .

i have been able to sync with one computer and stream content from two laptops with the same quality from each source  .

the stup is simple and took about 30 minutes from opening the box to viewing the first movie what would make this unit better is the day when apple decides to offer itunes movies and tv shows in a higher , less compressed quality than the one for sale now until then , this box does exactly what it claims to do and does it very well .

context    .

i've never been very happy about the fact that i give $50 to the cable company every month  .

in return , they give me a bunch of video content , the vast majority of which i have no interest in watching  .

the few shows i  do  want to watch often don't fit my schedule  .

and if i don't want to spend the $50 one month , the content is gone my wife and i decided to perform an experiment   we would ditch cable , spend $30    $40 on a single tv series on itunes each month , and make due with that and network tv  .

we would save money , and have commercial    free , on    demand digital video that we could keep forever to boot  .

key to this experiment , of course , is a way to get the video onto the tv  .

enter apple tv for my needs , apple tv is a nice fit  .

i'm not worried about about being limited to mostly itunes content       where else would i get my content  .

(if i'm choosing between microsoft's drm or apple's , i'll go with apple  .

) i don't want a dvr       that would require me to keep my cable subscription , and perhaps add a dvr subscription  .

i just want to watch itunes videos on my tv , and it does a nice job of it setup    .

recent intel mac mini as the media server  .

airport express wireless (802  .

11g) router  .

32    inch insignia crt tv  .

i can create an all    digital video library  .

that's the selling point for me  .

i love the idea of having all video i own available on    demand via an on    screen menu  .

and nobody else offers a viable alternative  .

i don't want to have to manually rip every video i buy from dvd using a probably illegally    developed , rough    around    the    edges piece of software  .

digital video content distributors are few , all rely on drm , and everybody except itunes uses a microsoft drm which requires windows and is far more restrictive than fairplay    when compared to video playback from my ipod to the tv (via an analog rca connector) , the video quality is great  .

others have complained about the lack of hd    quality content from itunes , and it's not hd , but it  is  digital , which is a nice improvement for me    high    quality streaming  .

i haven't yet used the device extensively , but my airport express has often had trouble with stuttering when streaming audio , so i have been quite impressed with the lack of any problems streaming video  .

the hard drive space is limited (see below) , so i'll probably use the device strictly for streaming , and that seems to be a viable option on my network    instant access to podcasts  .

i don't think this has been fully appreciated by most reviewers  .

a significant amount of great video content is available for  free  , on demand , via podcasts  .

i expect that content to grow as apple tv expands the market for video podcasts  .

i can watch the nightly news and meet the press whenver i want , without dealing with a vcr and without paying any subscription fees  .

i can keep in touch with the sports teams at my alma mater across the country  .

and it shows up instantly on the apple tv , without any manual intervention    apple design  .

i don't have much to add to what everybody else says  .

the hardware and software is designed by apple , so it's not junk  .

one nice touch i noticed is that it displays itunes comments next to movies and tracks when browsing  .

as far as i've noticed , this is the first time itunes and friends have incorporated additional metadata (besides title , artists , and album) into their fancy graphical presentation of content    doesn't support 480i resolution (sd)  .

i upgraded my old tv in order to use apple tv  .

it is old , and i could use a new one (especially given the impending death of analog tv broadcasts) , but it bothers me that the lower half of the tv market       sdtvs       is incompatible with apple tv  .

many sdtvs support component video input , so the only apparent technical restriction is the lack of resolution support  .

i'm not an expert , but it seems like it cannot be that hard to scale down to 480i (and add letterboxing , if the aspect ratio is a problem)  .

ipods , after all , play 480p video at 240p without difficulty    the hard drive is too small  .

at 33 gb or so of usable space , it can hold about 4    5 tv seasons , or all my music and photos plus a few movies or tv shows  .

anybody who is serious about itunes video (and why else would you buy an apple tv  .

) will quickly acquire far more content than they can store on the drive  .

apple's default solution is to just synchronize the newest unwatched videos  .

that's probably okay in most cases for my viewing habits , but it doesn't work for my baby daughter who likes to watch the same shows over and over (and over )       they still need to be rotated , but not based on how new they are  .

another option is manually choosing what to sync (too much work) or using the device in a mixed mode       accessing local content when it's available , and otherwise streaming (again , too much work) in the end , i'll probably just use streaming exclusively , and i'm not sure what i'm going to do with the hard drive space (besides storing photos , which cannot be streamed)  .

it's too important to me to be able to access all my content from one menu  .

of course , i can respect the fact that , as my library grows , no drive on the apple tv is ever going to be large enough  .

the ideal might be for the software to manage the hard drive transparently       anticipate the fact that i'll want to view unwatched content and copy it over , but display in the menus  all  my content  .

that way , i would get the performance benefits of syncing in a lot of cases without sacrificing easy access to my full library    no support for airtunes  .

i'd like the apple tv to be an upgrade of my airport express       extending its features with additional ones  .

i can accept the fact that apple chose not to build in wireless routing , but the lack of airtunes is disappointing  .

as a consequence , i'll probably end up connecting  both  the apple tv and the airport express to my stereo you might think airtunes would just be redundant       the device already streams audio from itunes , after all  .

but itunes offers a lot of advantages over apple tv when it comes to playing music , including    .

superior interface for browsing , creating playlists , rating music , etc    simultaneous playback to multiple devices    support for internet radio , including live content (sports , for example)    party shuffle    no need to turn on the tv (some people might say the same about no need to turn on the computer , but in my case , the computer is always on and the tv is not)    playlist folders aren't hierarchical  .

i make liberal use of playlists       every time i burn a backup dvd , for example , i hold on to a playlist so that i can track what's been backed up  .

playlist folders in itunes let me do this without cluttering the screen by hiding the playlists i don't generally use  .

disappointingly , apple tv ignores these folders actually , it's worse  .

rather than just giving me a  long  alphabetical list of every playlist in itunes , the playlist menu shows me my playlists sorted by the order they appear in itunes , but without any hierarchy  .

in other words , the fully    expanded hierarchy is collapsed into a single list ; when looking for a specific playlist , instead of just needing to know the folder in which it appears or its name , i've got to remember how my folders are sorted in itunes and guess at about what point in the list i expect the playlist to appear if i'm playing synchronized music , i can get around this (more or less) by picking exactly which playlists i want to share  .

but streaming doesn't offer that option , and it does not respect the sharing preferences i've already set up for computer    to    computer streaming this is a general problem that extends to the whole itunes ecosystem       apple just cannot seem to decide how to handle playlists  .

itunes gives me a collapsable hierarchy of folders ; front row also uses a hierarchy  .

the ipod playlist menu is a list , sorted alphabetically  .

various preferences in itunes (including the apple tv synchronization preferences) use lists sorted either alphabetically or in collapsed    hierarchy order  .

why not just use the folder hierarchy everywhere  .

i have no idea    composer information is never displayed  .

itunes and friends have never been great about handling classical music metadata , but the extra screen real estate provides an opportunity to do something about that  .

maybe next update    no support for movies from iphoto  .

i have both 320x240 avi videos and 640x480 quicktime movies in my photo library  .

the apple tv provides a perfect opportunity to view and share these movies , but instead it ignores them    audiobooks should not be buried in the music menu  .

itunes is messed up when it comes to audiobooks anyway (you cannot easily treat a ripped cd as an audiobook , for example) , but at least apple tv could distinguish between the two categories  .

movies have more in common with tv shows than music does with audiobooks  .

no dvd playback  .

this seems to be a dealbreaker for a lot of people  .

it's not terribly important to me , but in the absense of an easy way to import my dvds into my itunes library , it would be convenient to have some other way view my dvds  .

sure , i have a dvd player , but my tv only has one hdmi input ; dvds have to go through s    video .

movies released on dvd are not available to rent for several weeks or months after being available in brick    and    mortar stores  .

many older films are not available for rent , only to buy (recent examples   hancock , iron man (original))  .

what's with that  .

many titles are not available at all (e  .

, la vie en rose , any of the original star wars series)  .

the hardware is well    designed , though , and would be a home run for apple if it had a good movie selection and carried cable and network channels .

photo streaming works only if you already have adobe ps , or else it does not work  .

adobe pulled the starter edition being free , so apple need a solution fast  .

restrictions with itunes  .

drm issues , purchased videos not displaying in playlists , videos not supporting playlists apple should recognise the consumer has to front the data usage costs , on top of aud$6 a movie  .

also the audio track is weak , i have a nad amp and need to wind up to +15db to hear as a fta broadcast    what gives  .

this equates to about 6x the power being drawn quality of movies is not so clear , i would rather go to a store and get a blu    ray for these prices  .

max video resolution is 720p    why  .

sick of constant relay switching to lock onto proper resolution as cannot handle a 1080p tv properly  .

i own a 50 kuro and t175 nad  .

i have tested the same ports and cables    it is an atv problem the wd    tv hd has 1080p 12 bit deep colour support , and will actually play most videos , and has far more extensive connectivity options  .

end of the day i wish i had purchased wd 1st and not wasted $300 on atv40gb .

i've been using my laptop for several months to watch downloaded programs on my flat screen tv  .

it worked fine , except that it is a pain to have to move my laptop , hook it up , change the settings , etc every time i wanted to watch something  .

i thought apple tv would be a great solution there are good things about it    the interface is nice , the picture is fine (for downloaded content) and it's nice to be able to use the remote to stop , play , find new stuff  .

and , i've put all of my music on it as well , so i'm using it as my stereo too but , i find it very inconvenient that i have to download content to my computer first , then sync it to the unit  .

why cannot i just download it to the unit  .

why do i even need my computer  .

also , i found the wireless sync very slow  .

it takes 10    20 mins to wirelessly download a hour long show to my laptop , but even after 1 hour , the show had not completely synced to the unit  .

i ended up hooking it directly to my network  .

this works fine , but means it does not work completely as advertised last , the unit is very hot    to the touch when it is plugged in  .

even when it is in standby mode  .

i end up unplugging it after i use it .

it still amazes me how companies like microsoft , apple and sony have not even come close to developing what i and what most people want  .

in the industry , they call it the holy grail    the complete media center solution  .

i think the answer is pretty straight forward but these companies have not even come close    but apple is the closest at the moment i , like a lot of people , have over 200 dvds  .

i want to store them all onto a hard drive  .

you are looking at around 1tb of dvd data taking up too much physical storage space  .

i want all of that data to be on a hard drive also , i have 100s of cds    i want all of that data stored lossless on a drive too    that is another 200    300gb of data  .

not to mention all of my photos , videos and future hd content that i want to store bottom line    i need 2tb of storage to feel future proof ok , so lets say i buy the hard drive  .

now , i want to hook it up to a good quality dac (digital analog converter) that has good software to organize my media and has a pleasant interface so lets take the apple  .

it doesn't handle all of the formats necessary    so an instant failure  .

it only talks to itunes  .

it doesn't support 1080p and i doubt whether it is capable of pumping out good quality 5  .

1 surround sound what i also find annoying is that you cannot stream a dvd which is playing on your pc to the appletv  .

which still means you need to have a dvd player/recorder and tuner i like the idea of the media streaming from your desktop or laptop  .

i could use my laptop to organize my media and then use the remote to navigate through it on the tv i recently bought a ps3 and am very dissapointed with its claims of being a media center  .

ps3 and xbox360 are not comprehensive enough to really work as media centers if apple is smart , they should have designed a device that can handle streamed data in every media format and from your laptop's dvd player  .

they should have included a tuner i also do not know if you will be able to connect an external hard drive to the unit and play the media on that as well bottom line   apple is on the right track here  .

but their first product is very dissapointing    it could have truly been the holy grail of home media entertainment .

i dislike this product because there is no streaming network channals to watch tv on  .

first i would like to say this is an actual review , i did go out and buy a 40gb apple tv though it will be returned as of today  .

maybe you are like me and don't like filtering through peoples opinions of a product they have never used when i am researching a product  .

if so here is my actual experience out of box the apple tv is refreshingly easy to setup and connect to my wpa protected wifi network  .

i is dissapointed that the highest resolution supported is 1080i as i have a 1080p hdtv , but that is not that big of a deal  .

the user interface is decent , the remoted is very simple and easy to use  .

i connected my itunes account first and is able to stream media instantly  .

i watched a couple of episodes of 30 rock and the office which looked pretty good on my 61 tv considering thier resolution is 640x480  .

streaming with wifi initially seemed to work great but when i attempted to authorize my girlfriends itunes the problems started  .

after authorizing a second itunes the first is listed in the apple tv menu but i could not access my media  .

i attempted to reconnect but at that point my itunes account would not pick the apple tv up as a device  .

i eventually had to power cycle the apple tv to connect again  .

speaking of power , first the included power cord is about 3' in length    way to short  .

second , the apple tv apparently is designed to be always on  .

you can put it in sleep mode but cannot completely power it down unless i missed something  .

being that it is always on it gets very hot , too hot for comfort  .

i am not exagerating when i say hot , i unplugged it at night for fear it would start a fire  .

here is where the short power cord comes into play i would like to have mounted the unit outside of my audio cabinet so it would get good airflow but due to the limited length of power cord , i had to put it on the middle shelf  .

not good for a device that runs this hot after having the apple tv for about a week and experiencing multiple issues (now my itunes tv shows wo not stream i have to many to store on the machine itself ) i have decided to return the product and wait for a second or third generation  .

i really wanted the apple tv to work as am an itunes addict it just simply did not .

first let me state , i am not a republican , i am not a democrat  .

i vote for who has the best ideas to fit the situation  .

i do not like microsoft , i do not like apple , i buy from whoever makes the best product (and who does not try to rip the consumer off in the process  .

now then  .

the apple tv  .

well , its another solution from another company to sell their line of products  .

when it comes to hardware , the world needs a standard  .

that is , we need a standard video format , we need a standard streaming solution , we need a standard ability to choose our source of content  .

we dont need a new microsoft trying to sell us their wma over mp3 , we dont need another non removable internet explorer , and we certainly dont need someone forcing us to stick to their one solution for video in order for the home to truly become a digital media fortress , we are going to need vast amounts of storage  .

we are going to need a central server that can be accessed from the tv , from the desktop , from the laptop , heck , even from the phone (one day maybe)  .

the solution you ask  .

nas    network area storage  .

a little box that holds a few terrabytes of data , and is fully redundant    so you dont have to worry about losing your collection  .

maybe i wanna rip my dvds to a nas and watch them on my tv  .

maybe my cds  .

who knows , maybe even pay apple or micro$oft for a season of 24 but in any event , hardware manufacturers need to stay in their lane  .

when i buy a mouse , i expect that mouse to work on my pc as is , to work on windows , osx , and red hat  .

i dont expect logitec to sell me a special card to install into my box because they decided to change the mouse plug  .

someone needs to come up with a product that just accepts the video  .

they need to come up with a product that accepts the standard video formats  .

and they need , dag nabbit , to make it work on all systems  .

can it really be that hard  .

this product is an innovative step towards the future because it combines a few existing technologies into one item  .

but it is not completely new  .

why  .

the big part of the itv is you can play digital video from your computer on a home television  .

i have a creative vision m player that can already do this  .

i bought a video adapter for it so i can play videos , mp3s and photos from my portable player to a television  .

it is not hd but it does have a small video screen which the itv doesn't have  .

the main feature of the itv is already available and , for the same price , i don't need another item to display/play my files (the screen is small but it is self contained  .

which brings me to my biggest gripe    a mislabeled and misleading name  .

calling it the itv is wrong because it is not a tv  .

it is a digital media player  .

a television is an electronic device with a tuner that displays visual images (if it doesn't have a tuner it is called a monitor  .

) an itv has no display and it cannot display anything visual  .

it is not a tv  .

it is a hard drive with an hd video break out box  .

but i guess itv is catchier than idmp  .

at least with the iphone you know what you are getting (even though apple cannot really call it an iphone since another company already has that name    see www  .

iphone  .

com  .

)we should expect this from apple though  .

presenting the reality of a situation is not thier strong point    just look at thier ad campaign of mac vs  .

pc (and who cares about accuracy anyway  .

i also wonder how easy it is to play these videos for most people  .

most televisions i have seen only have composite connections (1 video and 2 audio) to the front or side of a television  .

the component (3 video 2 audio) and hd connections (either optical or hdmi)    the only ones the itv uses    are located in the back or , for plasma wall units , on the break out box  .

for some tvs , this would be no big deal but for what i believe to be most televisions out there , you have to reach around to the back of the unit and plug in without looking    if you even have the connections at all (can you tell i've had to do this already  .

) without the hd content available , the hd connections only provide a small quality advantage  .

but i'm sure apple will make sure more hd content is available so this won't be much of a factor  .

companies don't make hd content if there is not a way to view it  .

now there is one other thing to note  .

as far as i can tell , it can only play videos from itunes  .

other video file types are out of luck so , as an item to make it possible to play your videos you downloaded from itunes and want to show on someone elses television , this item is great  .

but it is not a tv nor does it display other video files  .

it doesn't record and it does not work with most of the televisions in the world (although more people are buying hd compatible tvs  .

) it is a 8 x 8 hard drive with an hd break out box that is a dmp pretty much for itunes only  .

that's it  .

i'm sure die hard mac fans will brag about it but for the 80% of the rest of the world , there are other options .

i do not want to spark a i'm a pc vs mac debate  .

this is an adequate solution for people who purchase a good deal of pre    formated itunes video content  .

it's a little bit of a hassle to convert all of your media files to support mac tv  .

i've had an xbox360 that offers an alternative for about a $100 more  .

you can stream all windows related content , videos , pictures  .

and the newly released update now lets you use music playlists from itunes  .

you can purchase hd content directly from xbox live , new movies and tv shows  .

i purchased for the gaming feature and is thouroughly impressed with the other media aspects  .

while the mactv offers a slick interface , it should have offered direct itunes , purchase support with direct downloadable hd content , as well as media support for formats other than quicktime and mpeg    4 .

someone explain why this is better than a media pc    say a mac mini    right in your living room / media room  .

i is actually looking forward to the apple tv as a mac mini optimized for the tv environment , but this does not seem to meet the mark .

i've had terrable luck with mine so far and i have not gotten it to work yet  .

i'm one of those 'apple people' who loves all things apple , so of course i is in line for this little addition to the family  .

well       it's really not worth it , i'm afraid  .

the lack of logic behind releasing a product that only streams standard definition content but requires an hd monitor is a baffling shortcoming that i really cannot figure out  .

i'll put up with it for certain tv shows , but i'd never choose to watch a movie this way  .

the format looks on your hd tv like it does when you make a low quality video file too large on your computer screen  .

a shamefully bad showing for apple .

when i first heard about this product i thought great , i'll be able to stream all my videos from my pc to my new flat    screen tv  .

well , looks like that is not so as this baby only streams itunes content  .

looks like apple is trying to monopolise video downloads the same way they have music downloads  .

at $299 this certainly is not cheap either  .

it may ba able to stream hd content , if it had any hd content to stream so what are you paying for  .

a nice looking box with no peripherals to speak of and a ridiculously small hard drive  .

i'm going to save my money and wait for someone else to come out with a similar product that doesn't keep me slaved to their content and will most probably cost half this price  .

nice try apple but you did not hit a home run this time .

i have a question regarding the use of this thing the setup is   i have a receiver dvd player and satelite receiver all connected with hdmi to my 720p/1080i plasma , and i have lots of dvd's 99% in wide screen 1) can i hook this thing up with hdmi through my stereo to get the great sound it puts out and feed it to my tv through it  .

currently i have the sat  .

receiver into the stereo receiver using an optical feed for the sat sound in 5  .

1 and above 2) if i use say a little lecie 500gb with usb attached to the atv for more storage and copie my dvd's to it , will it automatically put them into the atv required itunes (highest quality picture) settings or do i need to add all these on a machine and feed them manually into the lecie storage in a itunes saved database  .

( that sounds like allot of time to copy and format one by one is why i ask)  .

3) will the wireless output stream without dropping bits  .

ie making for a chunky movie experience  .

thanks  .

a very small market (mac users only) should even consider the apple tv  .

the crippled features is almost appalling when compared to slingmedia's upcoming slingcatcher  .

with apple tv you can only stream video through itunes  .

yikes , that's weak  .

when in comparison , the slingcatcher allows you to stream any content from your computer (or another tv or whatever) to your tv  .

you can also stream popular flash videos (like the free videos on popular sites like youtube , etc)  .

so , the slingcatcher does everything the apple tv does , and more  .

plus , it is $200 instead of apple tv's $300  .

slingplayer has won so many awards for their previous products that i am sure the quality will be just as high with their new slingcathcer  .

i am not sure how the mac support is from slingmedia though , so there might be a concern there for mac users  .

for the rest of us , do yourself a favor a watch this cnet video http  //reviews  .

i'm sure the apple tv will be a rock solid solution for what it does  .

but , it seems to be very limited in features compared to the competition , and it costs more  .

that why i am giving it an average rating (5/10)  .

of course i do not feel it is fair to rate something before it comes out , but it just seems with this product they are aspiring for mediocrity .

i have never bought from itunes  .

i just rip from dvd's  .

appletv lets me treat my movie collection on my hard disk as one big library  .

while that is good , it is also bad because there is no way to organize the movies in playlists like music when i click on a hd trailer , i get a black screen as i wait for a long time for the trailer to start  .

most of the time i just cancel  .

painful experience  .

the sd content like trailers and ripped movies do not look very good  .

and yes , that box is very warm it does not surprise me apple has made no comments on appletv for a while .

paired 160gb apple tv with macbook air so i could leave movies on apple tv and have some hard drive space left over  .

i bought tv shows on apple tv and those transfered to my computer automatically , when i deleted them on my computer to free up limited hard drive spave media also deleted completely from apple tv  .

so , if you are buying one make sure you have at least as much available hard drive space on your computer's hard drive  .

for me this seems like a complete lapse by apple  .

i've always purchased apple products and figured this would have been one of their solutions to the media storage problems on their small hard drived laptops , such as the air  .

the fact that it did everything so well and seamlessly before this problem just makes the shortcoming so much worse  .

i hope the apple store accepts it as a return .

i wish this product worked as well as my imacs , and macbook pros  .

unlike their computers , apple tv is loaded with bugs and experiences constant problems synching with itunes  .

want to synch a tv show you downloaded to itunes on your computer  .

good luck  .

sometimes it works ; sometimes it doesn't  .

so what to do  .

search apple tv help  .

good luck  .

most fixes involve restarting apple tv  .

no big deal , you think  .

think again  .

when you restart , apple tv must re    synchronize everything , and if you have a midsized or large itunes library , that will take a day or two over a wireless n network  .

so you wanted to watch something on apple tv tonight  .

tough  .

maybe tomorrow night ; maybe not  .

just when you thought everything is working well , apple tv will begin to synch just for the fun of it  .

and because it appears to enjoy re    synching as much as a teenage boy enjoys , well , you know , apple tv re    synchs a lot i have owned an apple tv for over a year  .

the longer i have owned it ; the more discouraged from using it i have become  .

when you cannot rely on it to work at least 70% of the time (and that's being generous) , eventually you give up trying bottom line    don't waste your money on an apple tv  .

hook up a mac loaded with itunes to your television's pc input and use front row  .

in other words , eliminate the middle man between itunes and your television  .

it only costs $40 to buy the video adapter and a monitor cable (with sound jack) long enough to reach from your television to wherever you have your laptop or mac desktop or spend your money on an hd dvr and download movies to that device instead  .

for your music , doc an ipod to your stereo or home theater system whatever you do , do not buy an apple tv  .

sorry apple .

ok i am a big apple fan so i really wanted this to work i purchased hd transformers over my fast cable modem and it took an hour to download  .

then movie stopped halfway when viewing and needed to download more  .

hd is compressed i wanted ability to play looped video content  .

cannot  .

to convert one of my 2 hour  .

mov movies to work on appletv took 18 hours on a g5 2  .

7 machine  .

time to transfer movie took 3 hours on apple airport great network needs to be easier to update your cable remote to work with it  .

need ability to buy a movie not just rent appletv should be free with a one year contract to rent 48 movies ( 2 a month) .

this is just a set    top box that allows you to buy or rent video content from itunes  .

why would anyone pay hundreds of dollars for that  .

the ipod also lets you buy content from itunes    and many do    but of course people initially bought the device in order to rip their existing cds to it , not to obtain the privilege of purchasing from the itunes store  .

apple cannot let you rip dvds , of course , but with a little ingenuity they could let you stream free content from the internet  .

(apple tv does let you watch a limited number of free youtube videos ; but you cannot , say , watch colbert on the comedy channel , or a presidential debate on cnn , or thousands of other things that make the internet worthwhile  .

it's like going back to aol  .

) if apple tv allowed people to watch internet videos on their tv screen then they would flock to buy it , and apple and the studios could later make lots of money selling them premium content through itunes  .

that's how it worked for the ipod , and apple tv would work exactly the same way  .

but that wo not happen unless apple loosens up and offers some real value for buying the hardware in the first place .

i had the box and took it back  .

it does work very well for music and photo's  .

price tag is way to high for such minimal funtionality .

my first review motivated by rare disappointment in apple this review is mainly concerned with music the primary user pain point the apple tv could have addressed is extending control of itunes to the living room (or kitchen , etc  .

for me (and i assume most other users) , this is really about getting your itunes music to the rest of the house easily and with great sound quality (ie    video , tv shows , photos , etc are almost incidental) at this core mission , the apple tv offers a 60% solution forcing you to learn workarounds problem   memory capacity although it is four times the size of my 80gb ipod , the apple tv has half the storage (40gb) with memory prices plummeting , like most users , i am trending towards better sound quality and have burned my entire collection into 2 formats    apple lossless (for home) and mp3 256kbps (for ipod) if you are going to burn the entire collection and store away cds , why not go lossless , insuring that you can transition to any future format  .

if you do go lossless , why not listen to that format at home  .

the apple tv's 40gb onboard memory can only sync 14% of my lossless files so syncing is not an option  .

so , we attempt to stream directly from our macpro , leading to problem 2   poor streaming control first off , to stream your mac must be powered on , itunes must be open , and the mac must be awake  .

so to effectively stream , you must either (a) run to you mac and prepare it or (b) leave it running constantly disabling the screen saver  .

so , you leave your nice computer system running all the time  .

still , there is problem 3   the two    format approach i described above is not handled well by itunes (format    kind in itunes    speak)  .

workaround a    multiple libraries some suggest you segregate two formats into separate libraries  .

this is impractical because everytime you rate a song , create a playlist , or modify track info in one library , you must do in the other as well  .

no one will do this and as a result , the multiple libraries will quickly get out of sync  .

workaround b    smartlists some suggest using smartlist to segregate your formats  .

fine , but if you try to browse a playlist on apple tv , you lose artist , album , genre organization it simply displays a list of 11 , 000 songs useless workaround c    cohabitation allow multiple formats of same track to coexist  .

nope  .

when you browse your library on apple tv , you will see two copies of every song and no way to tell which is what format problem 4   poor play control to change the repeat mode on apple tv i must navigate out of music and stop the currently playing track suggestions    .

massively increase onboard memory 2  .

(preferred over suggestion 1) integrate into itunes the ability to limit which kind of music file can be streamed to apple tv  .

basically add a smartlist interface to the apple tv control interface in itunes so you can limit and define which files are available to stream (and even see) on the apple tv 3  .

better play control navigating to repeat is one example 4  .

alllow music to continue will exploring photos 5  .

integrate w/ imovie allow me to watch my home movies  .

duh i expect this device to improve over time  .

but for early adopters it is a disappointment .

i feel like i have wasted my money  .

first i have had issue with the wireless connection , if i am on wireless i can not see the apple tv listed in itunes , plus i had to disable my wep setting just to get on wireless i'm let down because i is thinking that this would work something like the ipod , you could sync you music , etc  .

and store and be able to delete your music or files from your computer or store them on a back    up system  .

because if you turn off the sync via itunes or apple tv it will delete all the content i called apple tv and they stated that apple tv is just an additional piece to work with your computer  .

i really feel like returning it because it does not work in the way that has been stated on apple  .

com or by some reviews also if you have purchased tv shows , podcast , etc  .

they do not show as hd  .

it is easy to use and the album art work looks great  .

there is no way to cut it on and off , no volume control  .

so i am not sure if i should keep it or not  .

could have been better .

it doesn't work with standard televisions and yet does not have any high def content either  .

this is basically crappy for everyone then and the price  .

that's just rediculous  .

so typical of apple to release an overhyped product that is 5 years behind the competition  .

everyone at cnet is a mac user and thus their reviews are always skewed in favor of mac products no matter how crappy they are .

you know its trouble when even the positive reviews start with good for what it does  .

put simply , if you have an hdtv (plasma , lcd , etc  .

) , you are going to be in for a disapointment  .

think an itunes video blown up on your 3k tv  .

artifacts , and poor quality galore  .

i returned mine , very disapointed  .

when they get high rez content (hd) i will buy it back apple fanatics will try to spin this with what did you expect  .

its near dvd quality my favorite  .

think of the source  .

garbage in garbage out  .

stick to the video ipod , or your imac .

so basically you have an ipod extender that plays your itunes  .

i dont know about other people but what i mostyl watch on tv come from cable or a dvd  .

you do not have access to either with this device  .

buy movies on itunes , are you crazy , same price you a get a dvd full of features extras and others  .

(btw who does that  .

) i love my tivo that i can rent movies from amazon for less and they play on my tv  .

and the video quality on appletv , common sd on an hdtv  .

i think the media has been too soft on apple (apple bias) because this is really a poor product with a beautiful design  .

if you have an xbox 360 you can stream from your pc without windows media center using windows media player 11    .

if you already have a tivo you can stream videos on your pc using hme or download content from amazon http  //www  .

or wait for sling catcher which will be $100 cheaper .

for $300 this is pretty rediculous  .

as mentioned by others its a poor excuse of a copy of windows media center  .

the 360 , for about the same money , does so much more  .

dvd playback , games , music and hi def video streaming and soon iptv no thank you apple  .

back to the drawing board for you .

in concept this is great , but apple executed the product very poorly  .

i very limited disk drive , poor high def support , lack of high quality movies and tv shows because this puppy is tied to itunes for material  .

i am very disappointed with apple tv and from reading the previous posts , the only people who are gushing over this product are those who drank the kool aid  .

imho , the shine is off of the apple .

i purchased a mac mini a while back  .

i do have windows loaded on it as well  .

it is run through my 40 bravia , and most of the time the picture and sound quality , run through my home theatre , 5  .

1 , is more than good enough  .

to purchase this , is just such an incredible waste of money , you can get double the hard drive , and some real controllable options with the min , if you want to stay within mac  .

there are also pc options that allow more networking and provide more content as well  .

i think this really could have been a nice product had it been thought out before hand as to what else is offered through current products already  .

i love being able to watch netflix , itunes , and other content through a big screen rather than a 13 in laptop , but i do not need apple tv to do it , and i would be able to watch certain things with apple tv .

why bother with this when you can have this http  //neodigits  .

more white plastic apple crap is never a good thing .

unlike the iphone , which does an insane number of tasks , apple tv simply syncs or streams computer content to your tv  .

for me , that is not enough to fork up the cash the critical consideration is whether downloaded movies are compelling enough  .

right now they are not  .

quality is slightly inferior  .

you get no special features  .

selection is very limited  .

i think i will stick with netflix for now the odd thing is no video record function  .

apple has really tied this thing into itunes exclusively and therefore the product does not do enough to succeed  .

as an apple shareholder i hope i will be wrong , but i think this will be the least successful apple product since the cube .

until apple decides to provide high definition content on itunes (in my opinion around next year)i wouldn't recommend purchasing this as your media center , it can transmit in hd but with the sub dvd quality videos that itunes is currently hosting the only hd content that your can use with it would be the hd trailers obtained from quiktime 7 (pro only export)and from other third party sites and sources it is not used to it's true potential  .

also again this product is designed for the technically inept so for those who want hd content they would have to find the content , obtain video conversion software , and convert it too an apple tv supported codec  .

even further irritating itunes still only offers videos for the us , i understand that they are only allowed to offer american tv shows to american citizens but they could at least find some canadian shows to give to us , such as just for laughs or well thats all i can think of but they should still offer it  .

so in conclusion either american or other i would not buy apple tv at the moment , and if other   never .

this thing is a piece of crap imho and i'm an apple shareholder  .

several attempts with phone help could not download software updates       had to take back to store  .

many times after movie is downloaded sufficiently to view , pressing play gets a blank white screen and you have to reboot by pulling the plug as stevie jobs has a phobia about buttons and switches on his stuff       rediculous  .

unit is difficult if not impossible to turn off , therefore it runs constantly , needless wear and tear  .

now the unit is not working at all , several reboots and the remote (which is the only control you have) will not operate the unit  .

so it's back to the store again an absolute piece of junk  .

look up apple tv disappearing on the apple support page to see how many issues people are having with this product without any resolution or support from apple  .

mine is now a brick  .

customer support wanted to charge me $50 to look at a problem that is essentially an apple software problem  .

their itunes software even thought it's price is alluring , do not buy this product unless you want to be charged $$$$ to fix it whenever apple upgrades its software .

after purchasing this unit from target i discovered that it only has hd output  .

i had to move tv's around in the house to be able to have it where i intended  .

i realized soon after that it only communitactes with itunes on the networked pcs  .

so then i had to install itunes and all it's background programs on all the computers  .

then itunes keeps crashing while creating a library , probably because i have a large library  .

okay , i can deal with this so far  .

then i realize that even though a video shows up in , and plays in itunes , doesn't mean it's compatable with apple tv  .

so i start to convert my collection , and again itunes crashes  .

after spending $220  .

00 for the unit , i realized that all i got in addition to what i already had is youtube on my tv  .

waste of money  .

my tivo already could pull pictures and do slide shows from my computers  .

it just could not do some of the video  .

i is hoping apple tv would have been able to play the full spectrum of videos on the tv , otherwise , what the heck is the point  .

i guess i'l just wait till sling catcher is released , and this time , i'l read up heavy before investing any money it  .

no need to get burnt twice .

on march 31 i bought an itv from the apple store in the southcoast plaza mall in costa mesa california  .

while i asked questions about how it would work it is clear the salesperson did not know much about the product  .

i then spent all day april 1 setting it up , which went reasonably fast , followed by learning how it worked including what it would and would not do , which did not go nearly as fast  .

based on that experience i returned it today to begin , i am well above average capable when it comes to technology and actually enjoy exploring new technology products  .

i looked forward to buying an itv both for my need which is to act as a media server for a g4 desktop as well as for the experience of seeing how it all worked  .

the g4 is at a different location so in the meantime i decided to use it at another location with an xp desktop and if all went as i assumed and wanted it to go i would just buy a second unit for the g4  .

heres what i found 40 gigs fill up very fast  .

i have 29 gigs of music plus an additional 15 gigs of photos/videos so no way to put it all on the itv  .

(why only 40 gigs when ipods have 80  .

) no matter i thought , i will just stream some or all of it as necessary  .

my big need is to be able to access all my playlists and to see photos on my downstairs plasma tv with the music and photos coming off my pc upstairs  .

moreover i wanted to do that playing music while watching the photo slideshows i assumed i would be able to create just as i do with my dlink media server  .

but that is not to be you cannot stream photos and must download them to itv  .

ok so i will do that and stream the music  .

it turns out you can do one but not both at the same time  .

the photos will be in the itv source while the streamed music is in another source and you cannot access both at the same time  .

as a result i decided i may accept only downloading some of my music to the itv source but why should i have to compromise  .

and to make matters worse if i then wanted to change the background music or add photos i would have to re    sync the entire itv ; a process that takes hours when you are moving 20 or 30 gigs wirelessly  .

in other words , no running upstairs to quickly drop in aunt janes vacation pictures for the family to see and/or to swap the beach boys for the beastie boys as background music and then there is the process of getting the photos from your pc to itv  .

on a pc you can only do that with one of two photoshop programs ; one that costs $80 and fortunately , photoshop album which is free  .

i downloaded the latter , three times actually due to program not responding bugs , and proceeded to import my 4 , 800 photos as instructed  .

they all moved into album in the files i had stored them in but when i viewed them on itv , the files were not visible  .

i could only hit play and watch as what i thought is the first of all 4 , 800 photos but as it turned out it is only showing 10 photos from one of the files over and over again  .

i know the rest were there because ironically i could see them randomly appear in the screen saver  .

but i is not able to find how (if) to access individual folders nor a way to create custom slide shows so    .

only 40 gigs  .

cannot stream music and see photos at same time cannot stream photos at all cannot create custom slide shows must re    sync entire library as opposed to simply adding new material under the heading of insult to injury i took it back to apple store and discovered they wanted a 10% restocking charge because , they said , they must destroy my unit to protect my privacy  .

(really  .

do they destroy the computers and ipods that are returned  .

) that aside , the fact that it does not meet my needs coupled with their inability to educate me regarding its limitations before i bought it , is my problem and cost me $30  .

i quietly explained this to the store manager who quietly pointed to the very , very small print on my original receipt that told me i would have to pay this should i bring the unit back  .

print i of course did not know existed when i made my purchase regarding policy the sales person did not mention  .

you would think they would point that out particularly for new products such as itv that have many unknowns associated with them like millions i have been on the cusp between the pc and mac worlds , in my case using both including a new sony vaio vista laptop purchased last month  .

i is looking forward to the release of the new apple operating system believing i would buy a desktop for all my civilian media needs at home , but thats now not going to happen  .

i am not angry that itv does not do what i need/expected and am not really angry with the apple store people who were just mindlessly following company policy  .

this experience has reopened my eyes to the difference between apples brilliant marketing these past 5 years or so relative to the reality of a company who gets much but not everything right before the mac fanatics among you jump on this , i understand that all products have limitations and that itv may be a very different product when working with apple pcs  .

my problem is more with how apple the company has mishandled my individual situation and , no doubt , many more like me  .

the last 5 years has brought me right up to the edge of becoming a real apple customer rather than simply buying the occasional ipod  .

the last 3 days has undone much of that if you plan to buy itv make very sure you know what it will do relative to what you want it to do and do not rely on the average apple store employee to guide you  .

while some are likely very knowledgeable no one i have met knew anything at all about what itv would and would not do .

i is very excited about getting the appletv  .

i bought it from best buy and took it back after it locked up twice and the wireless    n connection could not stream a 720p  .

mov movie trailer from my imac  .

so needless to say it is extremely disappointing  .

the system does not turn off it only goes in standby and the unit in standby is hot enough let alone how hot it gets when using it  .

also after leaving it on standby for a few hours it would not turn back on without hard unplugging it and power it back up  .

it did that twice in a 2 day period  .

so they obviously do not have this product out of beta even though i love my mac and love the integration i am going to wait and get the slingcatcher when it comes out this summer .

i am deaf and i need the built    in closed captioning that comes through in the tv ; this box does not carry this hidden signal through  .

the captioning coding is lost in translation when the tv shows are packaged as itunes episodes .
