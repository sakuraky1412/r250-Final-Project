a really funky hotel and just a few steps from botanique metro stop , so we felt well connected even though it is not very central , and this felt like it was good value for money .
the area is quite quiet which is ideal for a good night 's sleep , but it does feel a bit deserted when we stayed at the weekend .
we really liked the all the little touches in the hotel , like the basement retro games area ( a bit of fun for half an hour or so ) , good quality coffee maker in the room , apples put out at reception .
i do understand that the room is stocked with a very small supply of tea , coffee , water and that you could pay for more if you wanted to .
however , it did feel a bit stingy that we stayed 2 nights but the supplies were n't refreshed on the second day . . .
that was disappointing .
also , the coffee maker could make 2 cups of coffee per pod , so we could have had 4 coffees overall , but there was only enough milk and sugar for 2 coffees . . .
these little things would n't have cost much more to supply , but i suppose everything adds up ?
we stayed in one of the `` panorama '' rooms . . .
the view was mainly of a building site but you could see further out to other stretches of the city and we appreciated the light and airy feel of the room .
very spacious . . .
