part of our hawaiian vacation was 5 nights at the westin princeville ocean resort villas .
we were on a timeshare offer , and when we checked in we were given one of the smaller units on the property , which was essentially a hotel room with a queen size bed .
we did n't know there was an alternative , or even an upgrade to a king that could be paid for , so shame on the timeshare front desk .
the resort is the nicest timeshare on the islands , and we regard it substantially higher than our home resort on maui , the westin kannapali resort villas .
compared to that horrendous resort , the kauai resort is made of two and three story buildings , and with smaller private pools scattered around the unobtrusive buildings .
there was no crowding at the large pools or the smaller pools , and one gets a very relaxed vibe at this resort .
food was expensive at the hotel restaurant .
a car is essential because the resort is an hour from the kauai airport .
there are restaurants within short distance of the resort that offer fairly casual food .
we did go to the st regis princeville a few times , and we were absolutely enchanted by that ocean front luxury resort .
the westin villas have no ocean access , but it is a mile + walk to the st regis ( or short drive with free parking ) .
by all means , come to kauai and enjoy the laid back vibe , . . .
