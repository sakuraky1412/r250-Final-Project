called the marriott and the pullman and found that while a room cost us $ 130 for day use ( 6 to 8 hours ) , i would spend most of the time in the gym , restaurant , and maybe by the pool , so i opted for a gym pass ( us $ 21 ) .
i 'd say just wifi was n't great in a few areas , and the pool area is n't as nice as it could be -- just feels a bit old and worn , needing a bit of cleaning .
they did n't even know i 'm a gold marriott member , so i have plenty of experience with good and bad marriotts around the world -- and they treated me like a vip .
after dinner i headed back to the airport on the shuttle , again very prompt .
i could have sat around the airport but wanted to get outside and relax a bit before my night flight to the usa .
after my 2 hour workout and a good shower ( bring your own soap ) , there are sauna and steam but i did n't use them .
started with a coffee ( $ 3 ) at the lobby restaurant , sat outside to enjoy some fresh air .
upon arrival i was able to leave my bags with the bellman , he was very courteous .
then went to the gym for a great workout : the gym at this marriott is as good as mine at home in the usa .
totally recommend this hotel , and would stay here if i had a longer overnight layover for sure .
