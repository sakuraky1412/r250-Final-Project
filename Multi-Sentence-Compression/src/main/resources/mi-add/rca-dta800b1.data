the reception is a good as my digital tv , the remote is great , and the program guide is acceptable .
5 out of 5 stars  .
i went to my local walmart and i is considering buying a magnavox but did not like the fact the magnavox version did not have any controls on the box itself and no analog pass through so i decided to get the rca dta800b1  .
the price is the same for both but this new improved version over the previous iteration (rca dta800) is the better value  .
in addition to the aforementioned features which were missing on the competitor box this box also had another feature allowing a channel to be added without scanning everything over again as well as improved picture quality and channel holding ability over the previous version (i have both versions , thats why i is considering trying the magnavox  .
i did not have any problem during setup whatsoever though i have heard some complaints about a tricky setup  .
this is not my experience with either the dta800 or the dta800b1  .
the instructions were clear and simple to me , but everyone interprets things a bit differently so who is to say what may be clear to one person is muddy to another  .
i experienced a markedly improved picture for the local channels which previously were received in analog only , no more snow or ghosting  .
one thing i do believe is important though is that you have a good vhf/uhf antenna in place in order to receive the best picture and most channels in digital , unlike analog , digital channels are an all or nothing proposition thats why the picture looks so much better  .
if you are only getting a weak signal in analog you get a snowy picture but in digital you may not get any picture at all so thats why the antenna is vital  .
in summation the rca dta800bi is an excellent converter box for the price and i would recommend it without reservation  .
before we had a converter box of any kind , our tv reception is very poor  .
we live in the foothills of our area , and we could only receive the local nbc and fox stations  .
once we hooked up our same antenna to the box and to our tv , we were able to pick up all of the digital channels available in our area , in a clean , crisp format  .
this box is also smart antenna compatible the remote can be programmed like a universal remote to control your tv's volume , power , and input selections  .
also , if you lose your remote (like i always do) , there are front panel power and channel controls the electronic program guide (epg) is very basic  .
it shows the name and rating (where available) of the current program , and also of the next program  .
it works , but is not in depth as other boxes may be it says in the cnet review that it does have analog pass    thru , but i have not figured this out yet .
is free with goverment program and very inexspencive without the goverment coupon so if you need one its a good choice  .
i really enjoyed adding this unit to my tv  .
it does not take long to master this box  .
although it left out some features , it's does everything i need it to do .
we own our directtv equipment so when the box in my bedroom stopped working this summer , and i received the $40  .
cards from the government , i got one at walmart and hooked it to the tv with rabbit ears  .
the reception is so good , and i is able to get 23 channels , that we no longer have directtv or any other service in the house .
ok , if you have a good old fashion aerial antenna and start using a digital converter box and notice that your signal strength is horrible , i would replace the cable from the aerial with rg6 type coax cable  .
i'm guessing most of the people who are having problems with aerial antennas are using either the old twin lead cable or rg59  .
these do not have appropriate shielding  .
what happens is both and antenna and your cable line will act as an antenna and the box will receive the same information but at slightly different times causing it to get poor signal quality  .
just a thought , give it a shot if all your other options are exhausted .
this is my first converter box  .
i plan to buy the insignia next  .
simple reason is the absence of the previous channel button on the remote of the rca  .
so if you are flipping back and forth between channel 04    1 and 56    3 you have to actually push in 041 and 563 to go back and forth .
not impressed  .
the box worked good for the first few months , the signal strentgh is always low but it controlled my rca tv and i is getting used to having it  .
after the dtv conversion it would not re    scan for channels  .
it gets to 50% adn then hangs there forever  .
i put it next to another converter box and the rca sig  .
strentgh is 35% , even thought the oterh box says 78%  .
i'd return it except they no longer sell it , possibly because alot of oterh people are having the same problems .
i live right in a big city , have an outside antenna and yet the signal strength is not that good  .
i have to rotate the antenna to get some channels  .
the channels change slowly  .
i wish the remote had a previous channel button  .
i would not pay full price for this converter .
ever since we got the box it has had a problem because the connectors are not held on to the box good enough  .
ive had to re solder the contacts just to get the connector to work properly ive had them ever since early january and i already need to go out an buy two new ones updated  .
on jun 25 , 2009  .
bought this box for my mom to use in a small city  .
the auto channel search feature is only able to find 2 of the 6 available channels (oddly enough it is to 2 farthest away)  .
this would not have been a big deal if there had been a manual option for setting channels , but there is not  .
the zenith/insignia box we bought next is able to find 6 out of 6 easily i brought the rca box to my house (large suburban area) and it is able to find 20 out of 20 channels without issue the box seems to work ok  .
however , i wouldn't recommend taking a chance on it    especially if you do not live in a large city .
i have a widescreen tv  .
i am disappointed that the converter does not support the format of my tv and there is no information on the box to warn me before making the purchase  .
now i have used my coupon and cannot get it back .
remote quit after 2 years and to replace it costs 35  .
00 which is half of what the system cost .
this box is designed to be able to work with a smart tv antenna  .
there are only a few in market today  .
try to find one and see if reception increases  .
i live in the bay area and i is able to find 45 channels  .
i see is this why my tv and box and outside antenna that is both analog and digital  .
it should have said that on the box to get a smart antenna .
this product is terrible  .
after hooking this box into my antenna i is getting a poor signal  .
i tried everthing to correct the problem including going up another twenty feet on my mast  .
i redid my entire sytem trying to find out my problem  .
in the end i went and bought a zennith  .
amazingly i went from 20% signal to 80    90% by just changing the box  .
i guess this pos cost me about $200  .
00 in parts and god knows how much in time and frustration .
the unit has a weak tuner  .
we live less than 18 miles away from the stations and the signals are less than 50% even though it is connected to a roof top antenna  .
a 50% signal is not strong enough to deliver a constant picture  .
it would drop in and out  .
we tried the dish network tr    40 on the same antenna and this box is tremendous got over 80% signal with the same antenna  .
we had sent an inquiry to rca tech service , so far no response  .
going to return the unit but i'll be out the rebate .
i have had 4 of these units and all of them have gone out in about 6 months  .
i sent 2 back for warranty and those two have also gone out  .
this unit is not woth the monty  .
buy something besides rca  .
this may be the last rca item i every buy have had various items from them that all sucked , and this item is no different  .
two failed in less than 6 months of use , each  .
pieces of crap  .
do not buy  .
i am going shopping .
i only ordered one coupon toward a digital converter  .
so , to have my converter quit after just a few months is more than a little frustrating  .
i had made the mistake of purchasing it at wal    mart , and when i called about replacing it , i is told they no longer carried any converters and that i would have to contact the manufacturer  .
so , there is a $40 coupon down the drain  .
i will be returning this converter to rca with a note informing them that i will no longer purchase anything made by them  .
i had purchased an mp3 player by rca which died after not even six months  .
i am very disappointed with this company  .
i have purchased a digitalstream converter and am hoping it will be better .
do not buy  .
i bought two of these boxes with my gov't coupon and waited several months before we hooked them up , that is my second mistake , the first one is actually buying the product  .
anyway , the unit worked fine for a very brief period of time (like a month) but eventually would not turn on  .
pretty soon the second one i bought did exactly the same thing  .
i returned the first unit to the manufacturer provided on the documentation inside the package  .
do you know what i got in return  .
not another converter box but a refurbished 5 cd bookshelf stereo system  .
so now i'm out of the government coupons but also two converter boxes that i will have to now replace with 100% of my own money .
we've only used this box for a few months , and now it wo not turn on at all  .
there is a light on the box even when the power is not on , and that light is no longer on  .
so i'm off to buy another one (different brand this time  .
) we liked the clarity of the picture    much better than we were receiving with analog  .
we also receive many more channels but that all is provided that the box is actually working which it is not .
forget about it  .
the majority of people are buying converters for emergencies  .
the time that snow , floods , or solar storms knock out our cable or dish tv  .
the majority of our tv have s    video (along with channel 3) realize that tv stations will start using smaller fonts and displays  .
at this point , in an emergency we need the most clear video possible  .
s    video is not great , but it sure beats the channel 3 input format this feature does not cost that much more (if any more) judging from the price of relative products keep shopping and as a minimum    find a product with s    video or better features .
Big buttons on remote. Cost with coupon.; Sound out of sync with picture. Poor signal strength.
Was able to pick up more channels than with analog; Already dead after just a couple months
Very easy to set up. Very easy to use. inexspensive.; limited output options to TV. but if you need the box you probubly can't use better output options anyway.
Improved reception drastically, easy-to-use remote w/ TV volume control, front panel controls, Smart Antenna capable, easy to use, widescreen and 4:3 format option; No analog pass-thru, no S-Video output, limited electronic program guide
I now know I shouldn't buy a third one.; horrible tuner, bad signal lock, easily overheated, horrible feedback loop when it loses signal (last 1/2 second of audio loops continuously until signal is rediscovered) I will not buy another one of these pieces of crap
Controls RCA TVs right out of the box.; Will not allow you to re-scan for more channels
It is so user friendly that my 94 yr old mother isnt intimidated by the remote. Also, it is very easy to set-up.; Haven't found any.
Nice remote; large buttons, remote is programmable to control volume and mute of TV; Flaky auto channel search algorithm and no option to set channels manually
So for I don't like it.; So for I don't like it wish they would leave things alone.. Leave the option to have analog. My outside antenna works for the analog I don't want to purchase a smart antenna.
The only thing I liked when the product worked is that it displayed not only was currently on the channel I was viewing, but what would be on next.; Everything else.
Can find none.; I have had three of these fail. At first it seems like the antenna , but then you realize it is the converter box.
It does receive a few channels; Remote doesn't work unless pointed directly at the unit and not sitting on a table/sofa. When scanning channels, often freezes on multiple channels without response for 5-10 seconds. Lost half my channels when official transition occured.
Easy to use. Nice picture quality. Wonderful remote; No cons unless you upped the price and added more features which are not necessary for this box at the current price.
None. This is a poorly designed unit even though it carries a name brand. How could RCA put their name on this product?; Universal remote did not work, we tried it on 2 different TV's. Therefore it couldn't control the sound level or turn the TV on/off. Don't waste your money/rebate on this useless piece of junk!
The remote controls your TV and the box. Picture is excellent. Had 7 channels now I have over 20+ channels; for $10.00 what's not to like?
nothing is good!; This is junk. I lose audio, audio-video sync etc. and have to turn off and then turn unit back on and off several times to get it to work. I have two of these and they both are like this. Is it the new DTV standard or RCA?
the remote is by far the best out there, and it can control the tv, too! I can not overstate how great it is. the reception is good, I have had no problems with it.; no s-video port, but no biggie, its a small tv.
Easy initial programing, smart antenna plug, Small in size, horizontal or vertical installation; Cheaply soldered and will likely need to be replaced if it is not stationary or you use heavy cable for the antenna. If you move the antenna to much or you live in a second story (no kidding about this) this box will not last you past a 3-4 months.
It was easy to program, and I liked that I could place it either vertically or horizontally.; The remote did not have a "back" button for reverting for the previous channel. But my biggest complaint is that it quit after 3-1/2 months!
With the use of a "Smart TV antenna" I am able to pick up 45 channels. The setup was easy to figure out. The unit itself is basic but there it's exactly what I expected from a digital tuner.; 1. Most of these things are supposed to pickup HDTV but there is no HDMI port to hook up to an HDTV.. 2. There's no button on the remote to access the guide right away. You have to go to the menu and then choose channel list.
I was able to get this easily and at a great price. It was easy to set up and has a great signal.; This converter only supports letterbox (widescreen with added black bars at the top and bottom) and 4:3. This means if you try to view it on a widescreen TV then it won't fill the screen. Also, the remote response is sluggish.
The pros of this converter is that the package is small, the buttons on the remote are big, you get the analog pass through, and the box can be operated even if you can?t find the remote. Picture appears to be clear.; The converter is really slow to tune to channels and the biggest drawback of all is that there is no previous channel button on the remote. Well worth an additional $10. There are a few channels now that just display and unusable signal message.
