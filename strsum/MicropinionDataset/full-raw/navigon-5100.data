this is purchased in december 2007 as a christmas gift thorugh amazon  .
com at a cost of $150  .
navigon also is offering a rebate of $50  .
00 with proof of purchase  .
thus it made a great deal for only $100  .
unit offered alot more the other brands at this price , which were base models .
i'm very happy with my personal navigon 5100  .
being a field service engineer , it helps me get out to my customers on time and it cuts time because i know exactly where i'm heading  .
the points of interest work great for someone not familiar with the surrounding area  .
i'm currently using it in elko , nv (a pretty remote area) and it's working great  .
a must have before navigon starts requiring a subscription for traffic .
i read a lot of bad reviews , but i still order that unit , and to be honest i really like it  .
it's just works , you know  .
on the other hands i had a megellian 3100 wich is very fast , but when i drive , i like how's navigon looks like , the menu , the map , the features , the traffic control is amazing  .
it's showing 20    25 milles ahead what's happening on the road  .
is not that cool  .
i had a different kind of navigations all this years   co    pilot , tomtom , garmin (which is i really hate) , magellian    and they all works , but navigon , just really works for me  .
that's all .
i bought my unit on ecost  .
com  .
it is a refurb , but i think the only thing done to it is that the software is updated to 1  .
2 and the maps were updated to 4th quarter 2008  .
i read quite a few negative reviews on navigon 2000 and 5000 series units and is hesitant to buy until i read 2 or 3 reviews of how awesome these little buggers are after you do a free software update since mine already had the new software on it , i experienced nothing but bliss out of the box it has all the bells and whistles needed for a gps , but nothing else (no mp3 player or picture viewer)  .
i'm sure those things (along with many others) could be hacked somehow (it's running windows ce core) the voice of this unit is quite soothing and pronounces street names very well  .
the routing is very quick , even compared to my more expensive updated garmin nuvi 255 (which is stolen)  .
i've found that the routes calculated are indeed the shortest routes (it even factors in traffic  .
gotta love those software updates eh  .
the only things i do not particularly like about this unit are the power button (it does not click ) and the smallish screen (compared to the overall size of the unit) i would highly recommend this unit to anyone who is looking for a cheap , fully featured gps as long as you are savy enough to preform a simple update   )  .
comparing it to other gps systems it is no doubt a winner  .
the 1  .
2 update has all of the new features that were lacking  .
chain stores , loccal stores , new poi categories  .
plus stuff like stadiums just built this year are showing up with the new update all very good stuff .
i researched for about 2 months before i purchased this gps  .
i am so glad that i went with this gps  .
it is a beautifully designed gps  .
slim and sleek  .
very easy to use , even has a take me home button  .
where else can u get live traffic right out of the box  .
the only thing i wished it did have is weather .
i live in a town that is famous for getting lost in  .
(check out mapquest 60546    2231 and look at the street layout  .
) so i tried it finding some local locations and used the take me home function  .
it made me do a bunch of turns , but it got me to the location and it got me home  .
for regular destinations , it is great  .
it gave me prompts before the turn , and just before the turn  .
also , i took it on the commuter train (from downtown chicago) to fool it  .
since it is not on a road , it constantly recalculated the route (to get home) and did a good job  .
the tomtom (which a friend had on a recent trip) did not speak street names , which this one did  .
all in all , i like it .
love it , works better than my garmin and tom tom  .
as a gui (graphical user interface) touch panel designer for a/v control systems a major concern of mine is a good looking panel with nice graphics  .
that may seem odd to some people , but i knew i would have to live with this device on a regular basis  .
i considered other gps devices from tom tom , magellan , garmin and others  .
the worst graphic quality is on the tom tom units and garmin units , but the magellan units and harmon kardon units all seem to have pretty good guis  .
theyre not nearly as good as the navigon products by my judgment  .
this is partially due to the lower color bit    depth and displays resolution capabilities of competing gpss lcd touch panel monitor screens  .
a secondary reason is just poor and outdated graphic design , particularly with the garmin and tom tom units  .
the navigon 5100's map route lines are free of jagged edges and it easily displays curved lines smoothly in contrast to its competitors  .
its graphical elements also have semi    transprent features , nice smooth gradients and animation that make this unit the very best in the gps industry of course the looks don't stop with the display screen itself  .
the navigon's industrial design can be compared to the quality of what we've all seen from apple computers or a jaguar xkr  .
sexy , slim    sized styling and a cool futuristic looking mount are traits of this unit  .
one thing that some people might not realize is that the displays mount actually has a recessed ball    type joint that allows you to angle the screen about 15    20 degrees in either direction and you can rotate the ball mount up to 360 degrees as you face it  .
im not talking about the twisting mounting action as that is a separate feature  .
marketing materials and the company's website fail to show this in pictures or mention it in descriptions and at one point it is a concern of mine so in case anyone else has a similar concern the mount is quite useful and adjustable  .
another useful feature of the mount , and gps unit itself , is it's ability to be displayed either horizontally or vertically  .
an option within the units set up allows you to switch the display screen to vertical if desired with the horizontal orientation being the default  .
the twist on    mount can park in either verticle or horizontal positions  .
as a suggestion , it would be a good idea if the company offered a shorter length mount either as an available accessory , or ordering option to give customers additional mounting options  .
it might even be interesting if they offered a reverse or upside down oriented arm  .
it's kind of hard to explain what i mean by that with words , but it you look at pictures of the arm you might figure out what i mean  .
another reviewer mentioned that this mount is flimsy , but i totally disagree as it is actually very sturdy  .
i've mounted it in many different locations on my cars windshield and it held well in all cases and positions  .
there is a switch that you have to flip to secure the suction cup tightly on your windshield so maybe the person who complained about that didn't figure that out  .
a tip for future owners of the twist on mount   always rotate it in a clockwise motion for both mounting and un    mounting  .
there is a little button on top youll have to press before removing the unit  .
i'd also like to see a hard carrying case for the unit included in the price or as an accessory option  .
currently it does come with a tastefull suede type cloth bag  .
also different face plate overlays like carbon fiber styles , solid color options like white , blue , red , yellow or green and different gloss woodgrain finishes would be a very cool add    on accessory item  .
don't get me wrong , the titanium chrome faceplate is cool , but alot of people might want to give their unit more of an individual look or match it better integrate with their interior  .
of course , this is just out    of the    box thinking as far as functionality goes , the navigon 5100 also has a very handy feature called reality view which automatically pops up a 3d image of freeway intersections that arrows and exit signs to help guide you to the right lane  .
as far as i know , this is a first in the portable gps industry  .
other cool features include the free traffic reports that can (if you choose) re    route you automatically around traffic problems  .
data is received and compiled from multiple radio stations using the well established rds (radio data system) service and compiled to provide real time traffic updates  .
navigon marketing publications call this tmc (traffic message channel)  .
some competitors offer similar tmc services for a monthly or yearly subscription fee , but with the navigon gps it is offered free for life with the 5100 and 7100 models  .
for the soon to arrive entry level priced navigon 2100 , the tmc will be offered as an add    on option at an additional expense  .
some reviewers have complained about the tmc antenna that is included as far as how it looks and etc but it does seem quite petty if you ask me  .
the antenna is really very small and really you don't even need to use it  .
i get perfect traffic report reception and i never hook up the tmc antenna  .
perhaps this maybe an issue for people living in areas where fm stations are rare or hilly regions where fm strait line propogation signals might be blocked  .
so far i don't see the need to use the included tmc antenna in my area for those of us with a lead foot the navigon 5100 also displays graphics with speed limit signs in real    time and can warn you when youre over the limit  .
this feature can be turned off , or customized according to your city and highway driving habits  .
for example , i set the speed limit warning to tell me when i'm 10 mph over the speed limit on city streets and 15 mph over on the highway routes  .
don't tell the highway patrol  .
as far as traditional gps functionality , the unit seems to be just fine as far as speed and accuracy  .
of course , i live in las vegas so this might be partially why i haven't experienced any problems so far  .
however , i live in a fairly new part of town and all of the streets , including side streets are displayed  .
as far as maps , i'm not sure just what all the hype is about that other people talk about different brands  .
most gps units in the us use the same service called navteq for all of their map data with the only exception i know of is tom tom gps units which use the tele atlas system  .
for example , my brother owns a magellan 4040 and it also gets all of its map data from navteq as well and it's been wrong a few times when we've been in his car so i'm not sure how much credence i would put on other peoples claims as to one brand working so much better than another in this catagory  .
the navigon 5100 uses the sirf star iii chipset that takes data from up to 20 gps satellites at a time and so far the unit has been very fast and accurate placing my position within 20 feet or less  .
this may not work as well in high rise city locations like nyc as some other reviewers have claimed , but it seems like a tall building might affect just about any other brand gps the same way  .
so far , ive experienced no problems with the speed or processing performance of the unit that uses a samsung 2440 400 mhz processor running on microsoft windows ce net 5  .
o embedded operating system  .
there has been some confusion about the unit's sd memory capacity  .
at one point some owners expected the unit to have a 4gb card included with the unit because the units specifications listed it's maximum capacity as 4gb  .
this means the slot can accomodate up to a 4 gb sd card and does not mean that the unit ships with a 4gb card  .
it's kind of like your pc's computer specs when they say it can accept up to 4gb ram but then the pc itself is only shipped with 1gb because that is the standard configuration  .
the navigon 5100 comes with a 2gb card which so far seems to work without any performance problems or ill effects  .
sd card comes pre    loaded with the us/canadian maps  .
it does not include the 4 gb card but one could easily upgrade on their own if they felt it is necessary yet another useful feature is the selectable mode of the gps as it can be set to driving , pedestrian or bicycle modes  .
for example , if youre walking down a sidewalk against the traffic on a one way street the device won't try to re    route you in pedestrian road  .
i'm not too sure how it works in bicycle mode or what the difference would be as i have not tried that mode out yet there are a few cautions i would like to point out about this device before you decide to purchase it  .
for one , a home a/c adapter is normally not included in the box with the 5100 , though it does come with the car charger  .
however , i purchased the unit from a well known tv shopping network's online store and they included the home a/c adapter with the unit and their price is also about $100 cheaper than other online stores  .
the reason i mention this is if you decide to purchase the a/c home adapter separately it will end up costing you nearly $100 because you will have to buy the adapter from the company's website which ships it's accessories from germany  .
most of the cost is for the overseas shipping  .
at the products price point it should have had the adaptor included in the retail package box as an included feature  .
i is a little lucky i guess that the company i bought it from included it in the price  .
a minor irritation is the poi categories list will display all of the poi types even if you have deselected them in the options menu so this makes it irritating to scroll down when searching within the pois all categories list  .
however , it's important to point out that the poi's deselected will not appear on the map if you have deselected poi catagory in the options list  .
a final criticism , and important one , would be the units lack of volume output for the speakers  .
with the unit turned up all the way it still could use considerably more sound output capability  .
this problem needs to be corrected in future models as i have read similar concerns from other navigon owners  .
overall , i would highly recommend the navigon 5100 or the 7100 for those who want the larger display and blue tooth capability  .
as for myself i wanted a smaller unit after playing with my brothers magellan 4040 i decided a wide screen is a little too big for my personal taste  .
compared to other choices navigon seems to have a lot of unique features to offer  .
the low volume issue and lack of an included 120v a/c adapter (from most stores) results in rating this unit 9 out of 10 .
i just ate a restocking fee on my tomtom xl and thought i would try out this new navigon company i have read about  .
overall , i am happy with the 5100 after two weeks of use the highlights   i like that the 5100 has these two features that add to the navigation experience  .
traffic is a cool feature easy to use and warns you automatically and it is free  .
tomtom wanted over $60 per year for this  .
reality view is cool too    shows you pictures of upcoming highway exits with arrows for guidance  .
great design  .
i have not had any issues with the routing    maps seem very accurate  .
plus , the maps and menus look premium    not cartoony my concerns   my first gps fix when i powered it on seemed to take a long time , but that has not happened since the first time  .
some extra customization options would be nice overall , i would highly recommend this product    especially because of these new features .
i like the navigon over the garmin because it works better  .
garmin still has not caught up to technologies that navigon pioneered  .
the nuvi finally added text to speech and some 3    d view  .
navigon still has live traffic information for life and yes it is accurate complete  .
they also have a reality view that shows you what your exit looks like on the highway  .
this is so important when exiting highway you've never been  .
until garmin catches up with the technology out there i'll over look the minor bells and whistles of extremely obnoxiously high volume and being able to load my own custom poi's  .
as a side note , if you're driving and you have so much noise in your car that you need to use garmin's volume to the max you should not be driving it's dangerous  .
and you can add a custom point to a navigon you just cannot batch them in with the very nice poi loader  .
you have to add them in one at a time .
i've used it for several weeks now  .
it has sent me down an unpaved road one time , but aside from that , seems to find as good a route as i can find myself  .
(the unpaved road is a shorter route  .
i purchased this gps and is on the road no longer than 2 hours from delivery  .
i is headed for hilton head and had no directions , just an address  .
( ('m not crazy i had a laptop just in case) it worked flawlessly  .
half way we decided to look for a hotel  .
the poi worked great  .
the lane assist is a great option  .
the live traffic only came into play around charlotte , nc but we where traveling on a saturday morning so really no use for it i have used a garmin before and like it's ease of use  .
the navigon is a little confusing from the start but with time (and patience)it is well worth it  .
look for it on sale  .
i got mine for 179 from circuit city  .
do not pay $500  .
i've had my 5100 for about 3 days now  .
i'm new to the richmond area , and this machine is so accurate and precise  .
it is going to help my transition to this new place a lot less stressful  .
i wish there is an easier way to search for pois  .
overall , love the system especially the reality view and text    to    speech  .
i've never been much interested in gps systems , but having recently moved to a new city i decided to take the plunge  .
a friend recommended the navigon and i have to say that so far i've been delighted  .
it's hard for me to believe that the cnet reviewer described this thing as on the smaller side when together the unit and mount seem almost too big  .
however once i got used to it i came to love it  .
this thing is incredibly easy (even for a techno    idiot like me) and has a lot of handy features  .
i agree with the previous review that the take me home button is a neat thing especially good for my wife who cannot find her way home from the corner store  .
the realistic views amaze me  .
and lifetime free traffic information what are you kidding me  .
buy this thing  .
i love my 5100  .
just the design is something to love  .
it's very different looking than any other gps i've seen  .
the interface is very easy to use and it is so realistic  .
i drive a lot for my job and the traffic out of the box is great , no subscription required  .
i love that it gave me the option to avoid the traffic or ignore the warning  .
i never leave home with out it  .
now that prices have dropped , this is a great bargain  .
recalculates much faster than garmin models i've used  .
lane assist and reality view overlay each other making it easy to get around strange city highways  .
never takes 7 minutes to track 3 satellites       it does take about 2    3 minutes (3 city blocks)  .
noisy compact car makes voice sound faint (plusher cars are kinder to recorded voice)  .
most probs listed in other reviews result from not updating system at registration and/or not reading owner's manual  .
it's not that hard an interface .
i just bought mine few days ago for 2 reasons 1)traffic info  .
try to drive around in chicago with all the time congested roads 2) multiple destination road planning    very usefull for any salesperson and realtor                                                                                                                          .
i used before nawman pin 570 which is constantly freezing when i am trying see turns or flat 2d map view , plus takes forever to acquire position  .
sometimes never  .
asked me few times to drive around in a circle to get to destination where actually i am at this moment  .
not very good when you have a client with you                                                                                                                    .
navigon seems accurate , reality view i just experienced 30 minutes ago on a highway and basically this is dead picture showing the highway view with the signs  .
overrated                                                                                                                    .
menu is not very intuitive , but i will learn it quickly  .
seems that it lacks few things i would wish for but i am going keep it                                                                                                                    .
screens is better readable in the night view street names are flickering and actually i can see next cross street only in the 2d view  .
3d does not give the detail                                                                                                     .
mount  .
first i is surprised receiving huge piece of plastic , hard to adjust to locate the gps in place i like it to see  .
than i just mounted it on top of a radio in my ho nda element and i think that actually its high position is better because i do not take eyes off the road down to look for info                                                                                                                                .
is telling you street names and when to turn , remaining you right in time before the turn so you do not have to look at the screen voice could be little bit lauder on noisy highway                                                                                                                                      .
i am going keep it  .
overall i can not imaging how anybody would want gps with single destination routes like in tom tom one 3rd edition  .
(biggest disapointment in my life since almost every review on line is talking about routs in tomtom  .
what is the point to connect tom tom to computer to plan a route when the route is accepting only single destination )  .
i love my little navigation device  .
my favorite thing is the take me home button  .
no matter where i am it will get me home .
i bought this device thinking it would have a satelite like reality view  .
they've been advertising saying , it has so called reality view  .
i strongly disagree  .
it just another gps nevigator , and i'm sure you can find other brands of the similar features , at much cheaper price  .
yes , i do like the live traffic alerts , very helpful i would suggest you look into other devices before you buy this  .
if the reality view is only thing you're looking into , i beg you please do not buy it abdullah mamun  .

com  .
i've only used the 5100 for a few days , but for two trips i've gotten routings substantially longer than the route i normally take also , considering this unit comes from a german company , i cannot believe that german is not one of the language options .
i bought this item in march  .
08 as a replacement for my navigon pocket loox which is lost when my truck is stolen  .
since then i have driven over 120 , 000 miles in all 48 contiguous states with the 5100 and am very disappointed with its performance in many ways the pocket loox had a much louder and easier to understand voice , which is surprising due to its small size in comparison with the 5100  .
in fact , after the first few days of driving with the 5100 , i turned off the sound and have never turned it back on because it is a waste of time i is hoping the 5100 would have a larger address book , such as the magellan maestro 5310 , but it has the same 30 favorite places as the pocket loox my two biggest gripes are the out of date maps and the 5100s propensity for freezing up , especially if you make a turn not in the planned route  .
it doesn  .
t freeze often , but when it does , the only solution is to do a hard reboot of the system which results in the loss of all route points  .
the maps often lack streets that have been in existence for several years and many intersections and highway exits that have been changed in the last five years have not been updated  .
what is really sad is that on occasion microsoft streets and trips , which is notoriously bad at updating its maps has a street or interchange updated and navigon does not in conclusion , i would not have purchased this item had i had the chance to use it for a few weeks first  .
my intent is to replace it with the maestro 5310 as soon as i get a chance and keep the navigon 5100 in my local daily driver  .
it may be okay for the short trip in your home town , but i wouldn  .
t want to have to depend on it to get me where i need to go 1000 miles from home .
given the feature set and the price i spent for this unit ($149 at radio shack) , i is excited about my purchase  .
the excitement faded the day after i bought the unit  .
i is going to a restaurant i had been to many times in the past , and decided to see how the unit worked  .
both my home (starting location) and my destination (la carreta restaurant) are in nashua , nh  .
i mention this because maybe some of the problems i experienced are specific to my geography  .
anyway 1  .
i noticed the navigon unit is sending me on an odd route to get to the restaurant  .
even though i knew the quickest route is to get on rte 3 (0  .
5 miles form my house) and take it to exit 3 (just north of the restaurant) , i went the route suggested by the navigon to see how poor the routing was  .
i then realized that despite having the correct address and zip code displayed as the destination , the unit directed me to a location 2 miles away from the restaurant , in a different zip code  .
luckily i is going to a location i already is familiar with and not relying on the gps unit 2  .
when leaving the restaurant to head home , the unit tried to send me through downtown nashua rather up the highway  .
with no traffic , this way takes twice as long because of the lower speed limit and traffic lights  .
during busier times , the route suggested by the navigon can take 4 to 5 times as long as zipping up the highway  .
even when i ignored the unit and went on the highway , it tried to take me off again at the next exit  .
when i took my exit from rte 3 (exit 7e) , the unit told me to take a left at the end of the exit ramp instead of continuing straight (as the map indicated)  .
this is odd , because i hooked the unit up on my way back from radio shack and the directions home were perfect taking the same route (rte 3 n to exit 7e)  .
in the interim i had gone to the navigon website and downloaded a software update , so i am assuming that the software update created this problem based on my experience , i would recommend staying away from this unit , regardless of how good a deal it seems  .
the main purpose of a gps is to get you to a destination accurately and efficiently  .
if it cannot do that , it is an expensive dashboard ornament  .
and when buying any gps unit , be sure to test it against several locations you are familiar with to determine how well it works  .
much better to find problems when you are not lost and dependent on the unit for guidance than to wait until you are lost  .
also , this testing will allow you to return the unit during the seller's return window .
in order to use this device while driving , you need a second person in the car to operate this gps due to the really small buttons on the touch screen , and you may even have to pull over to the side of the road so that normal motion of the car does not interfere with this  .
bought it from costco for $249 after rebate , but took it back  .
if the gui is as good as the little pharos 150 that is selling for $99  .
99 after rebate , this navigon would have been a keeper larger buttons on the screen , and a stylus like other windows ce device manufacturers include with their units would make all the difference  .
tomtom , garmin , pharos , v7 , even staples house brand all have much better gui's  .
it's too bad as the reality view and screen quality are awesome .
i had before magellan maestro and when i paid the premium for free traffic services i tought that i will get something extra  .
during the driving , you barely hear the directions even though the volume is at maximum  .
the information were too old and not useful at all  .
i will return this unit because could not provide value for money .
the text to speech feature is great , as is the zagat ratings and real view  .
problem is the things that are most important in a gps       clear speech and good directions       are lacking  .
the routing is downright mystifying , like taking you to the other side of rr tracks and then back again for no reason  .
the speech is muffled  .
i got it at a great sale price ($160) but am returning it .
do not purchase , try a better/different gps or just buy a motorola droid with free gps via google maps  .
it's what i use now for everything  .
great phone  .
worth the $120 i payed for it .
for starters the power button operation is silly  .
you have to hold it at least 6 seconds , then release it to power up  .
the next big hassle is that i cannot figure out how to make it navigate while connected to power  .
it goes into charge mode and all navigation disappears until it is again unplugged  .
the supplied windshield mount is cumbersome and illegal here in california  .
it would block my view in any case  .
no console mount came with the device  .
it is extremely slow to start up ; the manual says it may take 20 minutes the first time and that if it gets a fix in the first 5 minutes to continue sitting still for 15 more minutes  .
right  .
unlike my garmin gps , i cannot see how to easily transfer addresses and files to the navigon  .
the device gives excessive and useless information  .
continue on us 101 stay on us 101 keep left on us 101  .
we had about a half dozen of these in 5 minutes on a section of freeway with no real complexity  .
traffic warnings , when they pop up , are next to impossible to read while driving and to get the navigation screen back you have to interact with the thing  .
that's always a problem while move , but especially when it is telling you that traffic is a problem directly ahead  .
selection of which pois to show is not logical  .
this thing makes me feel pretty stupid and i am an engineer , an mba and a credentialed teacher  .
not recommended .
waiting for navigon to respond  .
the text to speech is terrible i called and they said well turn up the volume and i did and they said well that's all there is  .
i live in florida and we run the air conditioner all the time it is normal noise  .
we can not hear the text to speech at any speed  .
i think they have a poor customer service  .
i am going to look into another brand with a text to speech that can be heard under normal situations .
the navagon 5100 gave off the weirdest route from point a to point b ; changing the setting from fastest , to optimum , to shortest , to scenic ; the navagon failed constantly on my personal test , including telling me to make a very dangerous and illegal u    turn , with the option of u    turn not allowed ; making an impossible left hand turn (the navagon should have told me to take a different route like the garmin or tom tom)  .
i dont know how going from point a to point b the fastest by telling me to drive 2 miles north , then drive east for  .
5 miles , then over a mile south , i think if i just drive east  .
5 miles , and then north under a mile would be much faster  .
the person that programmed the navagon must have put his personality into it , making it a stubborn thing  .
miss my turn on purpose (cause my route is much faster) , and even after a mile , the navagon still wants me to turn my car around and drive in the wrong direction for a mile cause it thinks it is right  .
the list is nearly endless , i tested this baby inside out , to try and give it the benifit of the doubt  .
tested the navagon for over a week , loved the features that it has ; great bang for the buck  .
but at the end of the day , yes the navagon will get you from point a to point b , but not how the local would do it ; but more like a lost tourist .
sadly there are bugs in the us version , an update is promised for late this year  .
this is a great device in europe but the product line does not seem to have been customized for the us beyond sticking in us maps  .
standard points of interest such as post offices , major store chains have been left out routing is so convoluted as to defeat advantage of free traffic  .
if you are very technically inclined you can edit software , via your computer , to adjust routing errors .
i've tested this 5100 and the 7100 fo a while now it is not for anyone new to gps as it is very cumbersome interface the 5100 and 7100 need to be avoided until the bugs are worked out with software changes  .
garmin and tomtom did this a lot when introducing products to the us market  .
i would wait .
okay , so i is excited about the realistic view and the free lifetime real time traffic receiver but i soon got upset about many things that a standard gps is supposed to do first , map is outdated  .
it cannot find many of the addresses i tried  .
at times , it does not have some of the streets  .
so i had to call my friend for directions  .
second , i is trying to go to the nearest shopping mall , but guess what the poi doesn't have the one of the major shopping malls listed  .
it doesn't even have the nearest walmart and when it gave me a nearest one it didn't exist  .
i never had this problem with garmin nuvi or magellan  .
lastly , the vehicle mount stinks  .
not only is it too bulky it easily comes off especially while i'm driving p  .
i called technical support for to ask about a round plastic disc object and how to use it the technical support agent and his supervisor couldn't tell me how to use and told me to common sense  .
then without any apologies , just told me to go ahead and return the product if i did not like it i am definately returning this piece of trash .
i couldn't stand this product anymore and i had to return it  .
i got sick of it  .
it is a nightmare  .
like most of you guys , i is thrilled about the reality view feature , but it's just a trap  .
it only works in certain highways , not even the most important or congested ones  .
the volume is sooo pooor  .
the poi database drove me crazy  .
it couldn't even locate very well known retailers/shopping malls  .
i always ended up calling my cousin and asked him to look up certain retailers addresses on the internet  .
for the price it has very limited features  .
well , that is the main reason why i needed a gps   to locate places and take me there  .
it also lacks of many basic and essential functions that you find on less expensive gps's  .
you cannot search by zip code , (and intersections i believe) , you cannot change much of the retarded settings ok , now let's talk about the very few pro's about this product  .
i'm very unbiased even though the volume is extremely low , but if you stick it to your ears , the pronunciation of most street names is better than most tomtom's  .
also ; the re    routing is very fast  .
faster than my friends'/relatives'garmins and tomtoms  .
i is surprised too  .
as far as accuracy is concerned , it is the same as many other similar products  .
there is always a marginal error in all gps's  .
in some instances it provided me accurate directions and sometimes it failed  .
but my friends/relatives have the same problem with their other brands in summary , it's a mediocre product  .
i don't know why they sell it so expensive ( even though i bought mine at a bargain price  .
) it doesn't even offer basic features that other less expensive products  .
i would not even buy it if they were selling for only $50 .
the unit works ok sound is real bad and maps are very outdated but the worst thing buyers beware they have no place to repair them , mine has been sitting on my desk for 3 months because they said there not opening one till after jan i dont thing they will its a german company  .
if i is going to buy one for xmas please buy one where you can get it fixed  .
i belive there droping them after xmas because they keep dropping th price on them , if anybody knows where i can get mine repaired let me know .
i only used this 4 times before it stopped working , there is no way to reset it and it is fully charged  .
i would not recommend this to anyone , i have looked online and there are numerous other people who have had the same problem  .
it is basically just a big waste of money .
this is a very bad experience and i it bothers me that cnet's experts recommended this rip off because i believed them .
the navigon 5100 is typical of any other gps system the lifetime traffic is the main reason i bought this particular unit  .
living in los angeles i thought it would be useful    but    the lack of volume completely outweighed the benefit of free traffic service  .
like i said i'm in los angeles the mecca of traffic so you know the volume had to be really bad  .
reality view    do not get excited  .
this is not really an compelling feature  .
the only reality view is when you are on highway and the road splits  .
the reality view pops up with lane assistance  .
cute    but not enough to reccommend this gps appearance    the device has black piano finish  .
but the maps themselves are dismal grey and white tones and there is no customization  .
too hard to see in daylight volume    unless you drive your car with the radio off and window up    do not purcahse this device  .
you will not be able to hear the instructions/guidance  .
even at maximum level    you will need to turn off the radio , let up the windows and drive with no air conditioning or periphial sounds in the car because the sound is ridiculously , horrible and makes this gps is useless  .
believe me when i tell you , you will be disappointed  .
i returned the unit and switched brands ultimately navigon should be ashamed for selling such a substandard device .
