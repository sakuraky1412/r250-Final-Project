i paid $200 for this monitor , but even at $300 this monitor is a solid buy , with admirable performance and stunning resolution  .
i recommend this display to everyone  .
great monitor  .
i shopped around for about a month before i sold my old dell 21 inch , and bought this one  .
i looked at samsung , acer , lenovo , and other brands  .
firstly , its one of the only monitors out there with 2048x1152 resolution  .
other monitors with that resolution are very expensive  .
i have a 1gb video card , and i hook this thing up with gold hdmi connector , and i couldnt be happier , its unreal , buy this monitor if ur looking for a sharp resolution , and something on the larger side .
this is a great all around monitor with a ton of features for alot lower price then the competition  .
do not wait just buy it .
though a premium monitor , worth it  .
only one thing i can say    if one day ips pannel monitors will be priced as tns now , then i'll start shopping for new monitor , i hope this baby will serve me for 5    6 years i love this monitor and thanks god , i got it with no dead pixels .
i love this monitor  .
it would probably seem expensive , however i bought it in a package with my dell computer , and it is a very reasonable upgrade .
this is an excellent display which , for the price i paid ($270 us) , is one of the best deals online  .
i've had no buzzing or dead pixels , and have great connections from both dvi and vga  .
once calibrated , the colors stand out marvelously  .
as noted in the review , the acceptable viewing angle is rather narrow , and the display bezel give off a somewhat annoying sheen from the gloss  .
other than that , however , this monitor more than gets the job done for a price that wo not take a chunk out of your wallet .
love it  .
best monitor on the market for the price period  .
go for it  .
i've owned it for a month now  .
the ergonomic touch controls for the menu is very impressive , although sometimes the beeping from the monitors speakers can be annoying hd blue ray movies look really good on this monitor , although periodically on the bottom edge i've noticed a slim green bar (could this be the back lighting problem that the cnet review mentioned  .
) i only see it during blue ray playbacks the resolution is impressive compared to others , unfortunately these lcd monitors all have their setbacks and problems  .
i set out to get the best , and this is the closest i could find  .
i'm also a computer programmer and needed my text to be clear during regular usage  .
i had to increase the sharpness well beyond the normal preset to get it to look right without being too blurry  .
the colors also are on the more flourescent side during normal pc usage (non hd viewing) , although not too bad so that you cannot easily get used to it all in all it's the best i could find , i really wish the selection is better out there , or even there were higher end , more expensive versions available but i could not find any  .
all and all it's a great monitor , i even think it's better than the supposed #1 cnet pick  .
the response times are also much better on this as well .
i sent the monitor back for a refund due to the noise .
i bought one of these monitors around january 2009  .
i thought i got a good deal with a sale direct from dell but i  .
m very disappointed , mostly with the viewing angle  .
the colour and contrast changes dramatically from top to bottom  .
i also have a couple of dead pixels (to the side thankfully)  .
i do a lot of graphics and photography work and this monitor is basically useless for that  .
lots of bells and whistles for the money but a very average monitor  .
photographers/graphic designers beware .
i spend about 75% of my time on the computer word processing  .
i would have thought that with such simple needs this monitor would be fine  .
unfortunately , i've found this monitor to be unusable and will be selling it or returning it  .
basically , text looks very brittle and thin , slightly unfocused , and slightly jagged  .
i've done just about all i can with the setting and calibration to make this work , but it's no good  .
i once had a dell 2405 , which is brilliant  .
before this monitor i is using an imac (24 )  .
i've never had this kind of problem before  .
i would have thought that being able to display text reasonably well would be a requirement for production , but apparently not the one thing that this monitor can do passingly is images  .
color reproduction is not accurate by my untrained eyes  .
faces can sometime appear a bit orange , other colors like purple look overly saturated also , if it's helpful for others , coming from a monitor with a 24 screen and a 16 x 10 ratio , this is actually a bigger step down than i imagined  .
it is very narrow .
very large display good for multiple windows  .
great blu ray picture  .
camera broken and support might be easier if i flew to india instead of getting disconnected 30 times  .
no chat support available for monitors    (  .
got a great deal on this through my company's employee purchase program  .
when it arrived , however , there were two huge gouges in the gloss coating near the webcam  .
hooked it up , plugged it in , and is immediately blinded by the brightness of the screen  .
the colors were amazing , though , and wow looked absolutely beautiful  .
unfortunately , after about 30 minutes of looking into the screen , i wanted to gouge my eyes out from the searing pain of the brightness of the monitor  .
the super sad thing is that turning down the brightness severely impacts the beauty and performance of the screen  .
color were non    existent , and the lcd backlighting bleeds through horribly at the top and bottom of the screen  .
when using the hdmi , the monitor never goes into sleep mode  .
also , when making monitor adjustments , the changes do not get saved once you turn the computer off , meaning , you have to make them all over again when you turn the computer back on overall , this is a total pos  .
save your money and buy a similar    price samsung or viewsonic .
cnet is my primary source of info i decided to trust  .
ordered the monitor  .
that's when the show began   they show one total when you pay , but another amount comes as a charge to your card  .
i purchased it with a 3    days delivery  .
after 3 wks of order they finally sent me the tracking number saying the monitor is shipped on the 12th with the delivery date of 17th  .
now their web site says i received the monitor , csrs can hardly figure out the monitor has never been shipped  .
they don  .
t even know when the monitor will be shipped  .
bottom line   dell  .
s been using my money for a month by now , i  .
m without the money , without the monitor and their web site says i got it and there  .
s no one to complain to .
for the right price , this monitor could meet some peoples needs  .
however , any reasonable expectation of color accuracy    even for just watching movies or playing games    should be tossed out the window this is my first lcd ever with dead pixels on arrival , and it has two groups of them  .
this is also my first monitor from dell  .
any correlation there  .
if you're looking for a glossy monitor like i was , there are very few options in sizes above 20  .
i'm still debating a move to an lcd tv as an alternative to this monitor (jumping to 32 + is not something i really wanted to do    not necessarily due to price , i just did not want to go that big) not recommended .
i love the display and functionality but cannot tolerate the loud buzz  .
dell has not been helpful in resolving the issue so i'm not sure where to go from here  .
i ordered this on 12/28/09 and had a expected date of 1/7/10  .
just today , 1/5/10 , i received an email saying that my order is delayed until 1/14/10  .
after some searching online , i have found that dell has been very consistent with this process of ordering and delaying over the years  .
(http  //news  .

anyhow , i will be giving them a call to see what they can do  .
i felt that people looking into this monitor should be forewarned and also that this type of information should be in every dell review .
GORGEOUS SCREEN HD LOOKS FANTASTIC NO DEAD PIXELS, THIS MONITOR HAS ALL THE INPUTS YOU NEED, HDMI,DVI,VGA AND 4 USP PORTS! PLUS BUILT IN CAMERA AND MICROPHONE WOW! IM IN LOVE WITH THIS MONITOR, PREVIOUSLY OWNED THE SP2208WFP.; LOVED EVERYTHING NO CONS!
In Indian market, monitors with such resolution are not available. Good contrast, fast response.; Cannot see in showroom anywhere, have to buy without seeing!
Huge resolution, integrated webcam and microphones, slick and intuitive touch controls, flexible, great colors and brightness, tons of connections, and great aesthetics.; Less than perfect viewing angles, glossy bezel can sometimes glare.
none - never received the monitor!; DELL acts like a big scam company: they take you money for the product they don't have, never ship you anything, and at the end you can't contact anybody!
very good picture. looks great with ps3 and blu ray.; camera broken, been on phone with support for 5 hours and counting!
All around best for lcd class, great Blue Ray playback; Normal preset makes colors a bit on the flourescent side, slight green horizonal bar on bottom of screen during blue ray playback. Text could be sharper.
Vivid colors, HDMI, 2ms response, great for gaming and movies; Odd resolution, not all resolutions available, blinding brightness, glare, backlight bleeding, no true black, not good at all for photography work, webcam is atrocious
The higher than high definition display is SPECTACULAR. The display options are very responsive and usable. tHE WEBCAM IS GREAT AND AUDIO FROM THE MIC IS QUITE GOOD.; So far I have found no drawbacks.
Great design with plenty of ports, height-adjustable stand, and slick look.; High-pitched noise when monitor is turned on is grating. Would also like to see a 90 degree rotation (portrait) option on the stand.
It's not a cheesy TASTLEESS mate coating screen - it's a beautifull GLOSSY coating screen - LOVE IT!. Crystal clear, picture.. 2048X1152 resolution (higher than hd). cool stand. intuitive menu buttons. design is quite pretty. tons of connectivity; 65Watt operational power consumption (Cnet labs, however, state that sustainability is like 19watt (min. brightness) - 48 watt with max.t brightness) so, If I run it on 40% brightness, I assume it consumes like 35-40watt - if so, I have no cons.
The overall look of the monitor is nice (until turned on), I had been looking for a larger glossy screen to replace my NEC 20WMGX2 glossy for a while. Unfortunately this monitor is definitely NOT it.; Color quality is bad, especially blues. All solid colors have obvious intensity change from top to bottom. No way to position to avoid.. 2 areas of dead pixels, one upper-right. Second is a group. At least 3 dead in middle, reduced intensity surround.
Excellent picture quality, brightness, contrast, everything. I use this for both computing and hooking up to a gaming system through the HDMI port, and it performs beautifully.; Does not come with a built in speaker, but then again, most don't.
This monitor has a very beautiful, sharp display and has an easy-to-use menu.; However, it buzzes intolerably if not set on 100% brightness. The first monitor I had (I've had 3) shuts off after an hour and the only way to get it to stay on is to reduce the brightness setting and put up with the loud buzz.
Images look ok on this. Film, pictures, that sort of thing are passable. It's actually not too bad looking on the desk.. 2 megapixel camera is pretty good.. The onscreen menu is easy to use.; Display of text is horrendous. This can be fixed by altering the contrast and the sharpness, but then it begins to look quite dull.. Viewing angles are extremely poor. Unusable for me.. The onscreen menu beeps are extremely annoying!
For the price this is a good monitor for normal users but if accurate colour and contrast is a concern for you, think twice about buying this monitor.; I had a couple of dead pixels on this monitor right out of the box. The top to bottom viewing angle is poor and makes it difficult to work accurately with graphics and photography editing.
I love the clarity of the screen. I came from a 24 inch samsung monitor that had good color and black but the definition of this monitor is so much better. Its got great blacks too.; The adjuster for the screen height is very small and only goes up about 4 inches. I had to buy a monitor stand.
2048X1152 resolution!!! Thats higher than HD. I'm a big monitor and resolution enthusiast, and this thing BLEW me away. I set it up, and was so surprised with how clear it was. I've never seen a monitor so crisp and clear.; NONE, this is a great buy. The only con is not to the monitor, its to Dell. It took a full two weeks for me to get the monitor. I called a few times,and I guess they were backed up because they sold so many (I bought it when it was on sale for 209)
