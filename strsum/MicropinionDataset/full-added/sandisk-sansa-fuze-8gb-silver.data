the sansa fuze is a great mp3 player , it's been the only one i've had that has not caused me problems  .
oh and sansa fuze has great updates every once in a while but the updates make it better than an ipod as far as features are concerned  .
ipods are nice , but i am strongly on the saide of sansa fuze  .
the sansa view is not as great , however  .
it has more problems than the fuze does .
i love this music player  .
i am one of those teenagers that is always listening to something  .
i got this music player for approx $60 after a black friday sale almost a year ago  .
i immediately opened it (at 6 am) and started messing with it i use a 4 gig memory card so have 12 gig total  .
its great and very easy to use  .
it feels good in your hand with a slick front , rubberized/textured back , a good feeling weight , and the scroll key/thing feels sturdy enough i have dropped it a few times with no problem , other than once  .
actually i had it in my back pocket and sat down  .
well the internal screen broke  .
i emailed the company and they had me return it free of charge and sent me a brand new one  .
no problem ( i even told them i sat on it) very impressed with them , the people tried to help as much as possible to make things go smoothly all in all , its a great music player that can stand a little beating up (get a screen protector though  .
it has enough memory for someone like me to be happy  .
actually this is my first review i have ever done , thats how great it is  .
i charge it about once every 2 weeks , or if i use it alot once ever week very happy with this player , will and have supported the brand even more throughout the years  .
i would definitely recommend this player  .
sansa is a great company and they have great customer support and user    base on forums  .
sandisk  .
com  .
my previous player (sansa c250) actually went through the wash on accident  .
battery compartment came open , battery fell out and everything  .
still worked (s) like new  .
just be careful not to actually break the screen as they do not have a repair facility  .
that is the biggest downfall with sansa  .
not as many accessories as there are for the ipod , but i have a good docking station that works brilliantly  .
the screen is low    resolution and sansa media converter (smc) brings everything to a low frames per second  .
you must use it for video , but you can get away without it for pictures (and audio of course)  .
it takes forever to convert video (i recommend using another program to take it to  .
avi first , which seems to speed up the process , and then (if you have hard drive space) backup the videos onto your computer so you don't have to do it again  .
) there are approx  .
quarterly updates to firmware from sansa also  .
no gap    less playback yet  .
it is easy to classify anything as a podcast or audiobook (there are folders on the player that you can put files into , or classify by genre)  .
many supported audio formats (  .
wma ,  .
mp3 ,  .
flac ,  .
wav , wma drm) maybe more than i listed , contact me if you want to know and i'll do some digging       ) you wo not regret buying this player  .
i have never had problems with it  .
the microsdhc slot is a plus incase you run out of space  .
i got mine on ebay , but best buy (currently 99  .
99 u  .
dollars) is a good price too  .
enjoy  .
first , i have found that radio shack's everyday retail on this product is $80  .
not $100  .
plus , i got it on sale memorial day for $60 and the manager threw in a blister pack of 3 different covers to protect it and ipod speakers to use in my bedroom  .
so , far $60 i got a great sounding mp3 player , fm radio , video capabilities , photo capabilities and it is geared to work with rhapsody  .
com  .
overall , a great deal on a great item .
s a great all around value for the money  .
i spent an extra $55 on better headphones and an 8 gig micro sd card but the sound is fantastic and i have room for 2000+ songs  .
now if the could only sell a replacement battery that the user can easily replace , this player would be an absolute no    brainer .
i've owned somewhere around 10    plus mp3 players  .
archos , (other) sansa , creative , sony , insignia and so on  .
for the money , which in my case is under $100 for the 8gb version , i have never owned a better mp3 player ever  .
first and foremost , sound quality is of the utmost importance  .
there's nothing worse than a mediocre    sound    induced headache from a marginal quality mp3 player  .
that won't happen with the sansa fuse  .
the sound is crisp , clear and customizable with a built    in 5 band equalizer option secondly , sandisk has integrated expanded memory seamlessly with on    board flash memory  .
add an inexpensive microsd card and you cannot tell the difference between mp3's or movies on the internal memory or the microsd memory  .
this is a big deal  .
other players i've haven't been able to shuffle in on the expansion card or cannot bookmark your place in a movie from the expansion card  .
it may sound trivial but when the expansion memory acts like a completely seperate device it gets very tiresome very quickly and ultimately defeats the benefit of expandable memory  .
with the sansa fuse you cannot detect which mp3's or videos are on the built    in memory or the expansion memory  .
add a 16gb microsd memory card for about $50 and you get a total of 24gb of memory  .
that is ton of flash memory  .
24gb gives you somewhere around 3 , 500 mp3's and 15 or so full length feature movies  .
also of note is the video quality  .
the screen is on the small side at just under 2 inches but it is crystal clear and the video is very watchable  .
i currently have 10 full length movies on mine and watching movies anywhere is really something i've become addicted to  .
to get movies onto the device you have to download the free sansa media converter from the sansa website  .
drop most any video format into the conversion software and in minutes its on your player  .
the only negative here is that the converter does not give you options as to the size and quality of the video  .
i prefer smaller video files than the conversion software gives you but it's hard to complain when you see the quality of the video once on your fuse device  .
the average 2 hour movie takes roughly 500mb of memory using the converter  .
(if you don't have a way to copy your dvd's to avi files or similar mobile device files , it's very easy to find software available to do that  .
i use pocket dvd which is available online for about $30  .
there are also free programs available but i haven't tried any of the free programs  .
lastly , the build quality and interface are top notch for such a relatively inexpensive device  .
i currently own 3 fuse players , an 8gb for myself and 2 2gb players for my kids  .
they all three work flawlessly  .
i've added memory cards to all three players and have what would have otherwise cost me a small fortune if i'd have gone the ipod or zune route my only realm complaint is that the size of video files is on the large side for my taste , but that is balanced out by the quality of video you get from the sansa media converter  .
again , the video looks great for such a small screen  .
also , the operating system gets a little tedious when searching through a thousand    plus mp3's for a particular song or artist  .
ipods and other players are definitely a little faster when it comes to searching through thousands of songs  .
and lastly , the headphones that come with it are not bad but i prefer my sony and jbl headphones to the ones that came with the device  .
none of the cons are really notable when compared to the many , many upsides to this great little device my advice , buy the fuse  .
buy several  .
they're that good .
i wo not really use the other features fm radio , pics , and video , or recording my own voice (no one wants to hear that  .
this is a great little player with tons of features  .
the bonus is the ability to avoiding dealing with the drm , other limitations , and clunky interfaces of pc or mac software to load media files (e  .
itunes , rhapsody , winmedia player , etc)  .
while some have noted alleged incompatibilities with some computers , this is on account of the mtp usb mode that is the factory default setting ; switching to msc usb mode and the player acts as usb flash drive to drag your media files into it  .
as for wav compatibility , there are plenty of utilities available to convert wav or other files to mp3 files (hence the reason it is a true mp3 player unlike some other devices)  .
the included sansa media converter software will convert many other media file formats to those usable by the fuze (much like itunes does for ipods) ; it will even resize video files smaller (i  .
to take less space) while maintaining audio and video fidelity  .
all in all , the fuze has nothing to envy an ipod , nor does the owner of one  .
and i dont need to consult a [mac] genius to get my operational with music , pics , and video on it .
if you like just the things you need in a small , extremely affordable device , the fuze is just what your looking for  .
it has all the features of the ipod then some  .
plus , no need for itunes  .
this is my first big mp3 player , but i have used all kinds of ipods , even the touch , and i do not think any of them can stand against the fuze  .
i may be biased since i got mine new for only $55  .
you need this machine  .
turn away from apple ipods  .
i already have an ipod nano (4th gen , 4gb) but i saw this at a walmart for $30  .
needless to say , my expectations were not set too high  .
i is pleasantly surprised with this mp3 player for a number of reasons  .
it sounds good , has a fm radio tuner built in , has a custom equalizer (only 5 band , but this is a feature overlooked by most companies) and it has a microsd slot wow  .
i like that it does not require any specific software to load media and that it does not have any unnecessary games or other software  .
the case is metal on front and a rubberized back ( i would have gone with same glossy finish all around) could have used a lanyard slot on the top  .
the controls are responsive , if not a bit stiff clickwheel seems raised but i like the blue led ring overall a good little player , i am going back to buy a few more for christmas gifts  .
considering that i bought my first mp3 player (555 audio 1 gb) for $70 4 years ago , this is a great buy .
really a great player with a lot of features more expensive players do not have  .
the sansa website has a support section and forums for users to discuss and help each other with technical details    a very big help for me  .
i've been very happy with it for almost two years now the expansion microsdhc slot offers great flexibility  .
you can load up with 16 gigs of movies , podcasts and new music for an air trip for instance  .
then switch it out when back home for something else    without affecting the music stored on the internal memory  .
pretty cool  .
friends can swap out sd cards and trade music one small minus   rubberizied coating on back has started to peel a bit in the last few months  .
(almost two years old now)  .
not a big deal to me but a very slight gripe .
great mp3  .
rivals apple ipod on ease to use and and features but half the price  .
great mp3 player for 100 bucks  .
i love this mp3 , i will not exchange it for any other  .
plus , you can buy a 8 gb micro for extra room  .
will hold 12 hours of recording if possible  .
the time of recording will not shrink , unlike one of my first mp3 models the sansa e250  .
has a fm radio  .
and more  .
i highly recommend this mp3 to a friend .
it is a good player for a cheap price and holds many hours of mp3 songs  .
i can never cost justify an ipod but i can justify the fuze .
i like this mp3 player  .
in fact i like it a lot despite its shortcomings (which are few)  .
what i like most about the sansa fuse is its functionality  .
everything from transferring audio or media files , recharging , and using the player is simple to do  .
unlike the creative zen vision  m which is a great in its own right , its software is just plain annoying and flaky  .
the fuse can be used in mtp or msc  .
the msc format allows for drag and drop operation from windows explorer , or computers running other os besides windows  .
the only operation that is not drag and drop is the videos , which require conversion using sandisk's own video converter  .
while this is an extra step , the software is a breeze to use and painless  .
it's super quick to convert a 30 mb video (takes one minute on my old laptop) audiophiles and those picking about preserving the original quality of their music will appreciate the flac and ogg format support  .
these are good to have but for the average user , the mp3 format is the way to go  .
a 4 mb mp3 file increases to 20 mb using ogg and 30 mb using flac  .
not really practical at the moment given the limited size of the internal flash memory which means you carry less files (however at better quality)  .
i find mp3 encoded at 320 using lame to be just as good to the ear as those other formats (most of the time)  .
however the player offers expandable memory by adding a micro sdhc card  .
currently the largest is 16 gb card  .
in the future more higher capacity cards will be available which future proofs the fuse so that it won't feel limited in a year or two audiobook listeners will love the audible (online audiobook retailer) support , as well as the functionalities that make it easy to use  .
for example there is chapter skipping , resume playback of a book (it memorizes where you left off) , and sleep timer  .
the sleep timer has recently been included in the latest firmware which you can download from the sandisk website  .
it allows a sleep timer from 10 to 120 minutes there's so much more i like about this player , but not enough room here  .
quickly i like to mention the sound quality  .
that's one of the most important component of any music player  .
the sansa fuse does not disappoint  .
i've had four mp3 players in the past and this one sounds the best  .
yes i've tried apple ipods too , and the fuse just gives a more pleasing sound  .
i'd describe it as full , wide soundstage , detailed , forward , clear , and bass tight  .
i use three sennheiser headphones (px100 , mx500 , hd 595) and a grado sr60 which are excellent  .
the fuse just sounds great with all these headphones  .
i hear it mentioned before that the sansa fuse and clip are among the best sounding players available , and i am not surprised now for the negatives  .
i have had this player freeze on me at least once a day  .
while the fix is easy as holding the power slide for 5 seconds to restart the player , i find it a minor annoyance  .
with the firmware update , i think it minimized the number of times it freeze especially right after you add files to the player and the player goes through its updating process  .
the other negative is the screen  .
yeah it's small , but what bothers me more is the lower resolution compared with other players like the ipod and the zune  .
it still looks good , but text often have pixelated edges where it should be smooth  .
the screen is also plastic which makes it easy to scratch  .
the player should be kept in the velvet cover case which is provided with the player bottom line is this is the best audio player i ever bought  .
i think it will last me for quite some time , especially with its ability to add more memory in the future  .
i do not see a reason why one should buy an ipod over this , especially since feature for feature , price to price , and many other head to head comparisons , the fuse trumps the ipod hands down  .
in fact the fuse would trump many players on the market  .
i'd definitely recommend this player for anyone  .
it exceeded my expectations and so much more .
ipod killer  .
absolutely love it  .
you can sync with windows media player , and create playlists  .
the device is infinately expandable with micro sd cards  .
i have an arm strap that makes the player great for running screen is easy to see , although i would not watch a movie on it  .
the price , size and expandibility were the selling features that made this the choice for me over the ipod  .
made of metal unlike the creative zen , which has a plastic feel that turned me off  .
this player feels much more robust .
over all for the money and ease of operation this is a no brainer  .
a number of people here in my office have sansa mp3 player and they didnt have any issues with there units john  .
after spending too much time getting my kid's ipod touch to work and dealing with the inflexibility of itunes i looked around for the best non    ipod player out there and found the fuze  .
paired with creative ep640 ear buds makes the fuze just about perfect  .
sync's easily with windows media player ( probably realplayer)  .
you can also load stuff as though it is a disk drive  .
all with software you probably already have installed used the fm receiver while camping in the mountains of pennsylvania and is shocked at the quality of the audio  .
i could not hear a difference between the fm and the 128 kbps mp3's i had just listened to overall sound quality is excellent though small , photos viewed on the screen were vivid and crisp  .
as for video , i probably would not want to watch a full length movie but if you wanted to catch a music video or something else short , its a nice feature to have have not used the voice recorder in a real situation yet , but that's another nice feature to have this is one great little player .
my cousin just threw the black fuze over to me after getting an ipod and i honestly don't know why he would do that since this is more capable than an ipod i really like the build of it , how it has a nice shiny but not reflective face and a brushed metal back , it feels sturdy  .
i also loved the scroll wheel  .
i just like the sound of the wheel when it turns for some reason and there's a nice ring of light around it i don't mind the screen size for photo and videos , since for me 1  .
5 is the minimum for those so it is pretty good  .
viewing angles were pretty good , too , and the quality is great audio quality is good , too , although it's not the best , but it's pretty decent  .
cannot say ipods can do better i also liked how they put protection on the screen , it really didn't get any scratches , even when it is sort of a hand    me    down from my cousin  .
it wouldn't scratche no matter where i put it so that's a really good sign the radio and voice recorders are good extras , to me , at least  .
i like listening to random music once in a while and i really need voice recorders in my mp3s or else i'll die the half    a    star i didn't give it is for the non    customizable interface  .
i'm one of those people who like to play around with it and maybe change the background picture , but i guess it's ok  .
maybe it is just the style i did not like but overall , i really do recommend this  .
you get a lot for a great value and you're really paying for what you get .
i have only had my fuze a few days and have enjoyed it more than any other mp3 player i've ever owned  .
sound quality is fantastic with full bass , mellow mid    range and accurate treble , all of which is adjustable to your preferences  .
features abound and i do not see the dingy screen mentioned in the reviews  .
photos and movies , though small , are crystal clear  .
i'd recommend this to all my friends .
i really like my fuze  .
i got it from www  .
shopsansa  .
com with a promo code and i am really glad i did  .
i feel like this is the ultimate value for mp3 players and i am thrilled with it .
the sansa fuze is a very good mp3 player for the price , of course you can get better than the fuze but thats for hundreds of dollars more  .
the sansa fuze is very easy to use , anybody can put music on it minuets  .
the sound quality is also very high grade , its clear and goes up loud  .
the micro    sd card you get for free is a very good addition to the player , it adds 512 megabytes to it , but you can get up to 12 gigs to add to it now lets talk about the price  .
its goes from $79  .
00 to $129  .
the fuze goes up to 8 gigs  .
$129  .
00 for an 8 gig mp3 player is very good , see the ipod nano 8 gig for a comparison the only problem i have with the fuze is the music skips a little but when entering new menus , its a little annoying but not that bad  .
the silver version is prone to scratches , but if you take care of it you will not have to worry about this overall , the sansa fuze is a very good mp3 player , i would recommend it to anyone wanting a good mp3 player for not much money .
received the 8gb silver fuze for a christmas gift this year  .
it's a really nice mp3 player and i recommend it highly for people who are on the go that want a solid mp3 player that is compact and easy to use that does not fall short on features considering that you can buy an 8gb model new for less than 70 bucks i would venture to say that it's one of the best deals you can find on an mp3 player from a feature/value standpoint .
i bought the sansa at radioshack and i use it frequently  .
at radioshack they also have a 1 year replacement warranty which is a separate feature only through radioshack and it covers normal wear and tear and is one time fee and is only covers for one replacement for the product  .
so if you dont want to buy a brand new phone at retail just add the insurance to the product i like the fact that you can add a micro sd card and very small and compact  .
i just download most of the songs from frostwire  .
com and enjoy the awesome random music  .
i just wish they make a touch screen  .
its not the ipod .
just bought it and am new to rhapsody  .
windows xp sp3 would not recognize it , but real networks website (accessible through the rhapsody software help menu) is instructive  .
after reinstalling wmp11 , windows recognized the device  .
the rhapsody software perhaps could use some dummy    proofing  .
i (erronously) thought dragging a playlist to the device would sync it , and the software tried for each track  .
turns out , the track has to be both in the library and the playlist if you use playlists to sync  .
perhaps an error message to that effect might save someone my mistake .
i like this player  .
it has the features i want , is durable (even more so with the optional protective cover , but it's very difficult to remove , like when you want to change sd cards (there's no cut out hole for that) or clean it)  .
i like how you can have additional sd cards to install for additional memory , but if you have a playlist and change cards (and your playlist is even partially based on what's on the card) , it will lose what's on the card , and not replace the tracks even if the card is re    installed  .
it also takes a long time to load up (from an off position) if a full 8gb card is present (probably more so with a 16gb card , though i have yet to try those and see if they're compatible)  .
i also wish it had more volume  .
i have the eq almost pinned just to get more sound so i don't always have to turn it up to near maximum when i'm outdoors or whatever  .
despite that , it's a good product , and even though it's only 8gb , you can have as many add on cards as you want  .
just make sure that if you have a playlist , it's stored on the internal built in memory so you do not lose tracks if you change cards or remove them .
i really like this player  .
the size is great , nice weight and feel , fm radio  .
unfortunately it does not support wav format and my wife needs wav to listen to her meditation audio files  .
i went by cnet's review , only to find out it is incorrect .
for what the sansa fuze is , it is an excellent player  .
easily syncs with windows media player or just drag    n    drop you songs using windows explorer  .
video does require conversion software , but it is easy to use and works with your videos you have (did have an issue with  .
avi files , have yet to troubleshoot) the gui (graphic user interface) is clean , simple , and intuitive  .
i generally look back to the manual when i cannot figure something out , no need with the fuze , the basics are intuitive and make for a short learning curve sound is good , radio is clear , video good , pictures look good if others have to mention the sansa specific 30pin connection to find something bad to say , you know it's good if you are looking for a compact portable device to listen to the radio , mp3's , keep some pics , play some vid and not be limited to proprietary software (i  .
itunes) then this is the player for you  .
it looks good and plays good .
the positives have been covered in other reviews , so i'll just cover the negatives  .
let me be clear though , there are plenty of positives , and i'd definitely recommend this player to anyone id3 tags    i loaded up about 12 gigs of music onto my player , only to find out that most of the songs were sorted as unknown artist and album  .
a bit of research indicated that the fuze does not like any fancy id3 tagging  .
you have to use iso encoding and version 2  .
3 without long entries in the comment field  .
yeah , so i had to retag all my music (a relatively painless process with the right software , i used mp3tag) and then reload all the music to my fuze  .
it's not a big deal if you know to do it in advance , but it is a hassle to find out after the fact  .
these same tags had worked flawlessly in every other mp3 player i've used the interface is weird  .
it seems that sometimes , clockwise means scroll up , sometimes it means scroll down  .
some simple things require a few more clicks and inputs than i'd desire  .
turning on shuffle , for instance , requires a click on the bottom of the wheel , scrolling to shuffle , hitting the center button , scrolling to on , and then another center click  .
it still only takes a few seconds , but it could definitely be easier and the proprietary connector  .
this should be illegal , with the standard usb already so functional , stylish , and basically perfect  .
the fuze ships with a cable that locks into place , and requires you to push in two buttons to remove unfortunately , one of the buttons is inaccessible with headphones plugged in the unit also seems kinda slow to update its library all that said , do not let my focusing on the negative deter you from buying a fuze  .
right now , it's got the best bang for the buck at the low end of the market , and still manages to pack in features that the ipod lacks (well , ok , it has a radio so i can listen to my hippie npr stuff) .
this is a great buy if you are just looking for a mp3 player at a affordable cost  .
it plays videos with no problems and the 8 gigs hold thousands of songs .
this is a very easy to use mp3 player as long as you understand drag and drop  .
i don't dare try the windows media player sync  .
, i've heard bad things can happen and well i just like that drag and dropping of mp3s to my player  .
the limited golist is a real deal breaker for me  .
i love that option and i wish it would work with podcasts  .
i have many shows such as buzzoutloud and 404 that are downloaded everyday and don't have time for play lists  .
there is a way to get around that by renaming files so they do not have a podcast tag in genre and not using the podcast and audiobook folders  .
but then you have your music files mixed in with your podcasts , did i tell you it's 8gbs so that means a lot of stuff to sort past  .
this is one step closer to my dream mp3 player but still not prefect yet  .
i'd give it a three stars .
i got this as a christmas present  .
it works well but the sansa media converter is to hard to use  .
this is the main problem  .
the other one is not as bad as long as you have a good podcast agregator  .
i like this alot as a backup mp3 or one that i can just thrash  .
im personaly looking forward to the new zune hd .
if you are willing to buy a two year warranty and return to the store every few months for a new player , this is a good product at a great price .
as stated in the cons  .
this is the second sandisk mp3 i have owned that has been vey poor  .
i would still be using my creative labs zen if the screen had not died  .
that player lasted well over 2 years  .
no more sandisk for me  .
i really liked the player , but after several resets and a week long wait for a response from customer service to deal with a rhapsody compatibility issue , i returned this one and bought a zen .
i've been buying mp3 players since the diamond rio 500 with 64mb of memory  .
i've purchased the ipod nano which is comparable to this player  .
my son accidentally left it in his pocket and it went through the washing machine  .
the nano still worked when it dried  .
i've had two sansa fuze players in a little over a year  .
both failed after 6 months of light use  .
i did everything to protect my player  .
i even bought a hard shell plastic case  .
this player is typical made in china junk  .
it's a sealed unit because they do not expect it to last more than the warranty  .
spend the extra $50 and buy the ipod by the way   my diamond rio 500 from 1998 still works .
my one experience of sandisk cutstomer service has so far been appalling , i shall be taking this further  .
call centre in india for the uk , is less than helpful  .
seems like sandisk are reluctant to honour warranty .
check the internet  .
many users report that the device is not recognized by their computer  .
i received the device as a gift and liked the sound and ease of use but after having the device not recognized by two computers that met the published requirements , finding no viable fixes at the company website or on the internet and after reading about all the problems others are having with the device i would urge the reader not to buy one .
bought a sansa connect last year (the old version that is to work with yahoo  .
music  .
well , it sort of did  .
had tons of problems keeping player playing  .
when you would go on vacation for a couple of days , the content always expired  .
(i must have run out of magic pixie    dust  .
) after that you need a miracle to get the wireless zing service to connect and renew subscription rights  .
when it does not want to you have a useless player  .
needless to say , i is seldom able to satisfy the wi    fi gods i'm particularly disgusted , because i spent the extra dough for a wireless device , (with plays for sure technology how ironic)  .
we even prepaid for subscription service through july 2009 , and now i see the yahoo  .
music store's plug is being pulled by july 2008  .
one year early  .
the wireless feature (provided by zing) already seems to be dead now , 3 months early  .
i cannot get a wireless connection anywhere anymore  .
sansa connect customers were doomed the day they purchased predecessor of the fuse wonder what they will do to their new fuze customers  .
i think they should have called it the sansa disconnect  .
did i forget to mention that even when it did connect via usb , the synchronize should have been called doubling up because i usually just adds songs twice  .
(you usually have to delete all the music in the player , and then try to synchronize  .
(had a great deal of fun with this feature  .
the sansa connect website has an oh    well attitude about all this what a nightmare mistake buying the sanza was  .
want wireless , buy an ipod touch .
buy another player which will wo not break after 1 year  .
i hate this company    i have wasted hours and hours of my life by purchasing 2 defective 8 gb players in a row  .
sandisk knows that they are making sansa fuzes with defective lcd screens , yet they will not replace it    because it already is a replacement for another defective player  .
talk about a catch 22    no wonder why the economy tanked , people are tired of buying defective junk from companies llke sandisk  .
compact, intuitive GUI, drag-drop, good sound, good quality, good picture, Micro SD; video conversion required, earbuds uncomfortable
super cheap. expandible memory. fm radio; as said in the video boring menu. cant play many videos
Audio quality. Price. uSD slot. You can turn it OFF off; Picky with ID3 tags. Interface needs some work. Proprietary connector. Folder navigation is pretty weak
+Great sound. +Easy to use (Nice GUI). +Expandable (Micro SD slot). +Small size. +Recoding capability. +FM Radio &#38; Video * Pictures. +USB Rechargeable; No notable cons
-Insanely long battery life. -Radio and voice recorder. -Never laggy. -Better than iPod. -Cheap cheap cheap; -Screen scratches easy (maybe thats just me)
-Good Sound. -Solid Construction. -Music Subscription Support. -Decent Battery Life. -Memory Expansion Option. -No special software required. -Easy to use; -Screen could be better. -Proprietary connection for charging
Quality feel, Loaded with features, Accepts many more formats than iPod.; Could use a little better earpods.
Nice size, esay to use; I could never get it to work with subscription services
screen, size, colors, usability, scroll wheel, sound clarity; i have to share it
Cheap (clearance $30 at WalMart). Looks Good. External memory. Decent battery life. Ease of use. Custom equalizer. FM Radio; Clumsy controls. Proprietory docking cable, should have been more standard cable. Screen scratches easily (easily buffed out with toothpaste). poor headphones (what was with those foam pads, i couldnt get them on)
Does what I want: play music ! I like the adjustable equalizer.; Earbud covers slip off easy. Earbuds are bit unconfortable. I want more memory, even with the microSD card, I only have 16GB. Perfect for the girlfriend, but I want more!!!
easy to use. great for music. it's nice looking, analog scroll wheel.; sansa media converter inconvenient. no pod cast software
Good Radio and User Interface.; Many problems connecting to computers, sound controls (EQ) are easy to use but don't do anything.
It's interface is extremely easy to learn, it's battery life is good; It sometimes freezes when exiting a slideshow
slim, easy to use interface, rhapsody compatible, free microsd card; small screen, music skips a little when moving around the menu
Very good MP3, can store almost 2,000 songs, can hold movies, music videos and more! Has FM radio, and changes wallpaper in 6 different colors!; 1. Very expensive throughout the year, 100 dollars. I got mine for 69 dollars on Christmas Holidays.. 2. Battery drains fast. Must leave MP3 in PC mode for 12 hours.. 3. The recording will detect every sound. (Including winds)
You can add 8gig micro SD card and double the storage space on this device. Battery life is great and the controls are user-friendly.; I wasn?t happy with the headphones so I upgraded those. The proprietary contention on the device limits your options.
cheap for 8 gig; The screen broke after 1 year. The on/off switch is real hard to use. You need a big fingernail to use it.
Lightweight; This device is not built to last. I've had 2 devices in 15 months. The first device failed about six months of regular use. The USB interface stopped working. I waited 2 months to send me a replacement. Replacement died after 6 months of light use.
Easy to use, great features. great price, shockingly excellent FM receiver. Expandable memory. You can watch a video and look at pictures if you want to.; On/off switch a little hard to use. non-replaceable battery
The size..Quite thin and light. It also has a heaviness that isnt uncomfortable it actually makes the player feel durable. Has a slot for micro sd, so you can have unlimited amounts of space. Price under 100 dollars.; Sound quality isnt the best ive heard.
Decent storage which I expanded to 16gb. Small size but has reasonable sized screen. Decent audio for mp3.; Inability to scan track. I record hours of internet only radio which produces a single mp3 track that is hours long. It would be nice to be able to scan through the track to find songs.
Nothing. This is my second defective 8 gb Sandisk player.; Known issue: defective internal screens go "black inkspot", see the Sandisk user forum. I had this 2 months, it was mailed to me on 10/31/08 by Sandisk as a replacement for another defective Sandisk 8 gb player, so Sandisk refuses to replace this.
Small, light, attractive colors, simple menu screen, radio function, ease of downloads, micro sd slot, battery life, igo tips for it,; the cheap plastic feel, not so durable, screen scratches easlly, its missing the ipod touch screen feature, don't keep in pocket-sweat and moisture creates a frosty glow on the screen
The head phones, Features, Value, Very easy to figure out, and decent video quality.; Converting the videos to have sound can get a bit hard to figure out and time consuming.
full featured, excellent sound quality, easy to use, thin and compact, quick charge, drag and drop, FLAC &#38; OGG support, rubberized back texture, good price, expandable memory with Micro SDHC card, FM tuner,; proprietary cable, video requires conversion, relatively low resolution screen, plastic screen prone to scratches, player freezes often, no wireless
It has a GREAT battery, easy to use, tons of memory, Micro SD port, Clock, Sleep Timer, Sounds Great!!! Everything!; Interface is a little boring, but who cares, some times the USB mode gets messed up making some computors not read it
This is a great player! High quality audio and (though I haven't tested it personally myself) it has great battery life (78% after 3-4hr audio). MicroSDHC slot for expandable memory. Folder navigation (must update firmware). High quality player!!!; Few cons. No repair facility. Colors only for each size (see editor's review). Album art in album list takes a second to display, low resolution screen. Sansa Media Converter (SMC) is poor. No major deal breakers, all minor "flaws"
It sounds great and is easy to use. I compared it to the sound of the ipod and found absolutely no difference. Plus, the Sansa Fuze has an FM tuner which Ipod does not.; I wish there were better earbuds to listen to than the standard foam covered disks.
I use it for podcasts and audiobooks and find the resume function to be better then most players. The price and body design are also better then average.; Ive had two of these and the headphones didn't last a month. Within two months the control disk broke on both. Connecting to my laptop was also a serious problem for one of them.
looks really nice, and doesn't feel like a cheap mp3 player as such in the past with many of sandisk products. Plays Mp3, supports microsd cards. shows the albem art with out using media player sync.; there are many bugs still yet to be worked out, one of them is the golist will not let you add podcasts and audiobooks to it. Sandisk says they are going to fix this, good luck with that.
Beautiful form factor. GREAT audio quality. Drag-n-drop simplicity. Good voice recorder. FM radio. Use microSDHC cards for up to 16-32 gB of ADDITIONAL storage beyond the stock 8 gigs!. Good battery life. Nice UI. Updates of firmware available; Video and photos look good but require Sansa's Media Player software to convert to a format the player can use. Stock avi/divx/xvids cannot be just added without the conversion process- which greatly adds to file size.
owned this product for 2 monhs, was very pleased, good sound, easy to use,and don't need hi speed inet connection.; unit 2 months old, screen gone "blackinkspot". I was holding it when I felt it crack. The unit kept playing and I didn't notice anything untoward, inkspot appeared the following day. Contacted sandisk who are refusing to offer a replacement.
This player worked very well for about 7 months. Easy to use controls and loud!; Numerous freezes. 2 days ago in the middle of a song, PFFFFTTT!!!, dead. Cannot get it to power on at all. Now I have nothing. It's going back to Costco this weekend.
The size is great, options are fairly easy, sound quality is good, recharges quickly, accepts additional SanDisk micro cards, which can potentially up the capacity to 24GB (if it accepts the new 16GB cards; I have an 8GB card and that works fine).; Seems to take forever to load when my 8GB card is present. Scratches easily, but the optional protective cover helps. Acts somewhat "fickle" when connected to a PC. Sometimes it's recognized no problem, but others it's not "seen" no matter what.
User interface is easy, device is very compact.. Sound is great with good quality earbuds (these make a huge difference in sound of any player). SD CARD!!. More than enough volume, and enough battery life to get to china on one charge from Boston; Propriatiry plug (couldn't they use mini usb like everyone else). No AAC support, so these need to be converted
I bought this for my wife who never downloaded MP3 and for her to jump in with both feet and go through the different menus was real easy for her. Easy to read, easy to load and easy to browse the menus; We bought the carrying case which straps to your arm and getting to the power button is a little hard to turn it on and off. Other than that no issues
- Absolutely unbeatable value for build quality, versatility and sound quality!. - Seamless integration of micro sd memory as if part of the built-in flash memory!. - Long battery life in music mode.. - Amazingly crisp video given the small screen size.; - Operating system a little clunky when you've got a thousand or more mp3's to search.. - Video conversion software doesn't give size and quality of video options.. Note: "Cons" are only minor and not worth overlooking this great little player.
I have had a Sansa Fuze for about a year and it has been awesome the whole time, no problems or anything. I like the screen even though it's a little outdated on graphics but not much.; The only thing was battery life and of course the trouble of getting video, since i don't have my own computer. i just wish that videos were easier to get on the fuze than iPod.
