Great Hotel with Great Rooms .
Rooms in similar hotels would usually be about $250, 300 .
Rooms were nicely furnished .
Rooms in this hotel are noisy though .
Rooms are dated, our corner room's bathroom was shabby .
Great Location Nice Rooms Loved the Swissotel !
Rooms at the hotel are getting somewhat tired .
Strange, we thought, since we had booked conceirge level rooms .
Got to hotel, rooms weren't ready yet .
Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .
