you/PRP would/MD hear/VB some/DT of/IN this/DT noise/NN if/IN your/PRP$ room/NN faces/VBZ that/IN street/NN but/CC my/PRP$ room/NN faced/VBD the/DT back/NN of/IN the/DT hotel/NN and/CC for/IN most/JJS of/IN my/PRP$ week-long/JJ stay/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD quiet/JJ ./.

this/DT makes/VBZ for/IN a/DT noisy/JJ environment/NN ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT front/NN of/IN the/DT hotel/NN ,/, which/WDT faces/VBZ down/RP grafton/NN street/NN with/IN its/PRP$ rows/NNS of/IN bars/NNS and/CC hundreds/NNS of/IN patrons/NNS standing/VBG in/IN the/DT street/NN and/CC drinking/NN throughout/IN the/DT evening/NN ./.

they/PRP were/VBD very/RB responsive/JJ and/CC after/IN deciding/VBG it/PRP was/VBD not/RB coming/VBG from/IN grafton/NN street/NN ,/, came/VBD up/RP to/TO my/PRP$ room/NN to/TO check/VB it/PRP out/RP ./.

i/LS probably/RB would/MD have/VB appreciated/VBN the/DT westbury/NN even/RB more/RBR if/IN i/FW had/VBD not/RB stayed/VBN first/RB at/IN the/DT elegant/JJ ,/, historic/JJ -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC much/JJ quieter/NN -RRB-/-RRB- shelbourne/VBP a/DT few/JJ blocks/NNS away/RB ./.

soundproofing/NN from/IN the/DT hallway/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC rooms/NNS on/IN lower/JJR floors/NNS have/VBP windows/NNS that/WDT face/VBP directly/RB into/IN other/JJ buildings/NNS in/IN the/DT back/NN or/CC onto/IN grafton/NN street/NN in/IN the/DT front/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB noisy/JJ ./.

breakfast/NN was/VBD above/JJ average/NN with/IN a/DT buffet/NN of/IN fruit/NN ,/, yogurt/NN and/CC breads/NNS and/CC a/DT variety/NN of/IN made-to-order/JJ egg/NN dishes/NNS that/WDT were/VBD very/RB well/RB prepared/VBN ./.

my/PRP$ room/NN had/VBD plenty/NN of/IN lighting/NN ,/, a/DT large/JJ desk/NN and/CC comfortable/JJ easy/JJ chairs/NNS ./.

however/RB ,/, the/DT dining/NN room/NN was/VBD unpleasantly/RB crowded/VBN at/IN breakfast/NN most/JJS of/IN the/DT week/NN because/IN of/IN a/DT large/JJ pharmaceutical/JJ company/NN convention/NN ./.

however/RB ,/, on/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ night/NN ,/, a/DT loud/JJ ,/, thumping/VBG drumbeat/NN from/IN a/DT party/NN on/IN another/DT street/NN continued/VBD past/JJ 1:00/CD am/VBP until/IN i/FW called/VBN the/DT front/JJ desk/NN ./.

there/EX was/VBD a/DT tub/NN with/IN rain/NN shower/NN but/CC no/DT separate/JJ shower/NN stall/VBP so/RB entering/VBG and/CC exiting/VBG the/DT shower/NN required/VBN climbing/VBG over/IN a/DT high/JJ tub/NN ./.

i/LS was/VBD told/VBN it/PRP was/VBD coming/VBG from/IN a/DT rear/JJ street/NN and/CC they/PRP would/MD try/VB to/TO stop/VB it/PRP ./.

this/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB nice/JJ hotel/NN with/IN large/JJ public/JJ spaces/NNS and/CC outstanding/JJ service/NN ./.

the/DT hotel/NN is/VBZ in/IN the/DT city/NN center/NN ,/, surrounded/VBN by/IN bars/NNS and/CC shops/NNS ./.

my/PRP$ room/NN was/VBD comfortable/JJ but/CC the/DT bathroom/NN needed/VBD updating/VBG although/IN the/DT heated/JJ towel/NN rack/NN was/VBD much/JJ appreciated/VBN in/IN dublin/NNP 's/POS damp/JJ weather/NN ./.

within/IN a/DT half-hour/NN ,/, it/PRP had/VBD quieted/VBN down/RB ./.

my/PRP$ 5th/JJ floor/NN bedroom/NN had/VBD a/DT large/JJ window/NN that/WDT looked/VBD out/RP over/IN rooftops/NNS ./.

staff/NN are/VBP exceptionally/RB gracious/JJ and/CC go/VB far/RB beyond/IN what/WP is/VBZ asked/VBN for/IN to/TO accommodate/VB guests/NNS ./.

whatever/WDT the/DT annoyances/NNS ,/, the/DT exceptional/JJ service/NN certainly/RB compensated/VBN ./.

in-room/JJ wifi/NNS was/VBD fast/JJ and/CC reliable/JJ ./.

i/FW am/VBP giving/VBG it/PRP four/CD stars/NNS only/RB because/IN i/FW can/MD not/RB rate/VB it/PRP as/IN highly/RB as/IN the/DT shelbourne/NN ./.
