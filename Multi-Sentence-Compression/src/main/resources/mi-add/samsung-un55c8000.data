buy it  .
you'll fall in love with tv again .
if you are looking for one of the best tv's that offer fantastic picture quality , specially in 3d this is the one to look at peridot  .
fabulous hdtv to own  .
such hd quality i had not seen before  .
a worthy investment for home .
i have been shopping for a couple years waiting for just the right time to replace my 9 year old rear projection screen  .
it always seemed that while the editors had lots of good things to say about new models they always mention something not good that most times is far beyond my tv knowledge so i just kept telling myself i'll wait until the they say this is it the holy grail of tv's but of course that never happened yet  .
so my old tv finally needed costly repair and looked more out of style than ever so i went out to replace it and stood in every store that has display models  .
i looked at about 20 models that i is considering and this one easily stood    up above the rest like a redwood in a flower garden  .
i tried to look at all the others but i could not keep my eye's off it  .
the picture really pop's of the screen in a way that is hard to explain  .
its a very clear picture and things have somehow lost he cinematic experience watching this tv  .
let me explain the best i can  .
i is watching a movie tonight and instead of it looking like a fuzzy motion picture it looked more like a home video wait no not quite more like it seemed that i is standing beside the camera in the movie studio while the camera guy is filming the movie next to me  .
so it looked like i is there not watching it as a movie  .
now the 3d is really cool and will be better when i can watch something other than a cartoon with it but even the 2d picture seems to add depth i have never seen before  .
i'm not much for old movies but i watched a movie that is made in 1966 and it made that look like it is made yesterday this set will not disappoint you  .
i think the editors spend way to much time over analyzing these tv's  .
go look at the store first and you will see that this tv is really bright and stands out from all the others .
this is a sweet tv , i is really struggling to buy or not to buy 3d , i needed a new tv my plasma after 5 years is acting up (lg) and i wanted a larger screen  .
so do i get a non 3d and save a few bucks or go for the new i am wondering why i is questioning to buy or not  .
this blows away any tv i have seen at anyone  .
s house and they all have plasma or lcd the 3d led is the balls i watched monsters and aliens 3d which is great , but then i put in star trek ii blue ray and activated the 2 d to 3d and i is blown away  .
yes its not the 3d with gimmicks but i felt i is right there  .
i felt they were right there  .
the space scenes and the detail is well i cant put it in to words awesome , i don  .
t know how it tells what to separate but i does and its great i cant wait to go through the rest of my dvds so i have heard lg does not have the 2 to 3d feature but this does yea no problem with glasses either i recommend it  .
i have not tired the internet yet as i need the wireless usb when i do , there goes my roku it won  .
t be needed  .
a++  .
i recommend this tv , no questions asked , if you can afford it , do not waste your time and buy a non led 3d television set as this is truly the wave of the future , and you will regret if you go a different direction and buy a non led 3d television set now in a year or less .
my old 55 hd projection died after 10 years  .
all i can say is the picture quality on the 55c8000 is simply amazing connected via hdmi  .
i don't know what some of the reviewers complaining about picture quality are talking about , (blackness levels , flickering etc)  .
as always , upgrade the firmware to fix any bugs etc  .
i did not purchase the 3d glasses as i could care less about the functionality , but is looking for a great tv picture that will hopefully last for 10 more years  .
i very much like the internet connectivity    youtube etc  .
and downloaded a video on demand movie from vudo which is amazing i truly can not express how great this tv looks mounted on the wall connected up to my dish network hd receiver  .
it is located in a very bright family room (lots of windows , french door , skylights) and it still is picture perfect    nice and bright  .
anyway , if your looking for a really nice large hd tv    definitely give this one a look .
samsung led 3d tv is just great , the experience will blow you away , the lenses are great but i prefer rechargeable ones  .
3d blur on some images is ok for me since @ cinema is the same quality and come on 3d at home  .
who will imagine it the base for me is fancy (though i rpefer the normal base)  .
be careful by fixing the screen with the screw to the wall the best 3d led tv even better that series c9000 (6 , 000 , 000  1 contrast)  .
updated  .
on may 5 , 2010  .
i've owned this led tv for a week now and it has been no less than perfect  .
hooked it up , downloaded the firmware update and i've been in heaven since  .
the tv is extremely thin and beautiful  .
the colors are vibrant , blacks are deep and motion is clear and smooth  .
my biggest concern is how well the 240hz handled sports and action movies and thank god i have not been let down  .
the ps3 is capable of playing 1080p/24 and the c8000 displays the input when the blu    ray begins  .
i've watched star trek , transformers 1 2 , batman dark night 1 / 2 , and a few pixar movies and the film / video quality has been no less then stunning  .
my wife is blown away buy the natural film like quality of this tv  .
the 3d capability looks just as good as the theaters  .
2d picture quality is the best i've seen on any lcd led tv  .
the tv is not wireless but my cable modem is next to my cable box so i prefer the faster wired connection  .
i have a receiver but i did notice the tv speaker quality is pretty damn good considering how thin it is  .
i notice no lit up edges that the 2009 models had  .
i don't understand the lower rating cnet gave the tv maybe they got a bad test dummy model  .
i is able to order the tv from amazon for 2900  .
00 and if you ask me the flagship samsung 2010 3d led model is worth every penny  .
the tv has only been out now a couple of weeks and people who do not even own the tv or have went through the picture settings to customizes the blur and judder are posting negative reviews based on cnets rating  .
considering the 2 firmware updates by samsung , 1080p/24 working perfectly fine , 2d/3d capabilities , beautiful image and motion processing , perfectly fine remote (everyone with a highend tv uses universal remotes)nonplastic reflective frame and the fact that the tv can be bought online for 2900  .
00 or even less , cnet should consider reviewing their review .
we paid $2699 for this tv at amazon  .
com at the end of april  .
it is $100 dollars more than a comparable 2d model at costco  .
at that time it is a great value  .
i don't know what the current price is i do not care i would buy it again in a heartbeat  .
the 3d is great  .
we used the samsung bluray player connected to the internet to stream spartacus blood and sand to the tv  .
we set the tv to convert the picture to 3d and the effects were amazing amazing  .
i looked at tvs for two years before deciding on this set it is worth the wait and certainly worth the $2699 i paid especially with free shipping and no sales tax at least for now .
i recommend this tv if you can afford it  .
it is expensive and slightly over priced  .
but overall i'm very happy with the tv  .
if you buy this tv it's probably a good idea to hold off on the 3d glasses , etc  .
, until the price comes down and there is more content available  .
there is only one movie available and its a cartoon  .
is 3d capability really worth $350    $400 dollars  .
of course not   ) watching the tv in 2d is very nice and most of the internet apps work  .
however , samsung is having firmware issues with their internet partners (netflix and blockbuster)  .
this is the only major blemish also , i would recommend buying a splitter and connecting to the internet via a network cable (wired)  .
wireless is a joke you might have to turn off your modem and router for 5 minutes after you connect your tv to the internet  .
this is because the tv has its own mac address  .
in some cases you will need to register the tv mac address with your internet service provider you can find some good deals online but make sure the company is a certified dealer  .
this site is helpful for me  .
http  //www  .
resellerratings  .
com/  .
overall the good far outwight the bad  .
i would just hope that samsung come out with an update to address the 24fps as well as adding even more of a soap opera clarity look , it looks preety decent now but could be improved upon  .
(for those of you that dont like this look i say simple buy a plasma) plasma give yopu that theater look while led and lcd give you that soap opera look)  .
this is an excellent television for someone looking to purchase a high end energy efficient led tv  .
after viewing the 3d content on this television i can conclude it is a very sweet experience although i did see some issues  .
samsung has had some double image issues with their 3d televisions  .
this means that when you look at an object or layer in the background of the object that is currently in focus that background image looks almost blurry around the edges  .
i will admit that the 3d is very sharp and it is like you are right there  .
many people have asked if the 3d image is 1080p and yes it is  .
the tv has great black levels and the backlight is pretty uniform for an edge lit led display  .
the color is excellent and the advanced settings will allow users to adjust gamma levels , black levels , along with 3d settings  .
the applications seem endless compared to last year  .
i would suggest this model be hung on a wall due to the unattractive base and the fact that the base is manufactured in a way which make the tv lean forward  .
the 240hz only can noticed when you are watching sports or content that involves rapid movements and lots of motion  .
going into the discussion of 3d content i agree with others in stating that many people do not relish wearing glasses to watch content ; however , i will say that the 3d functions are very cool  .
it would be worth the money to purchase the 3d bluray player for the bernefit of having a bluray player and receiving the free starter kit  .
just think of events that you might watch in 3d like sports , shows , and movies , or applications  .
the best part is that these tvs continue to get even more narrow (0  .
9 on this specific model)  .
it is definitely one of the better leds i have seen this year  .
for those who are not early adopters i do recommend that you at least go to your nearest retailer and check one out on display  .
i hope this review has helped those considering this or similar models .
over all the tv is great  .
the soap opera thing is very odd and i just cannot decide if it is something i can handle or if i find it totally unacceptable for a tv with such a hefty price    tag  .
the worst part is , a consumer won't know about it until the tv is set up in their home because at the stores , all they show you is bluray , which is perfect  .
i am clearly no technical genius , but i am telling you now , there is something off and different from the bluray  .
it's my only real complaint about the quality  .
anyways , simplicity of the controls is great  .
there is nothing confusing or tricky about this thing  .
i read in one of the tech reviews that the remote is terrible  .
i totally disagree , i think it's great  .
very futuristic looking with a back    light and everything  .
i think the appearance of the tv itself is beautiful  .
i feel like i need to replace the stand it is on  .
my concern is that it is not completely worth what people , including myself , are paying  .
also , i bought the 3d bundle so i am totally 3d capable which sounded great exceptt in the 3 weeks i've had it , i have not located a single 3d movie to watch except for the little sample movie that came with the set  .
plus , the glasses are super expensive , like to the tune of $100 a pair on the cheap end  .
how is someone supposed to share their excitement with friends  .
i am not willing to spend hundreds of dollars on glasses  .
so , does it make more sense to wait a few years until the whole 3d thing is more user friendly  .
probably ok , in a nutshell   bluray is fantastic and best picture quality possible  .
hd is very clear and bright but some strange effects hinder the actual quality  .
internet right to the tv is super cool , lovin' it  .
sound , eh , not great but should have surround anyways  .
price , terrible  .
i got a great deal and still question my purchase  .
3d will be great , but now , it's just ok  .
just go see the 3d in theaters  .
esthetically very nice i think i am going to go back to where i bought it and see if they have the same tv just not 3d so i can save some bucks  .
if i could find the same tv just not 3d and for a grand less , i would jump all over it  .
it is just too soon for 3d to be all that great at home i'm just a regular person who bought this thing and i just hope that what i said will help someone .
i hope to have it fixed soon and that this will be the last of my problems with this samsung 3d    led tv  .
i really enjoyed it for one day  .
since then i'm a bit worried about the build and component quality .
imho , this set is not ready to be on the market  .
if i had it to do over i would wait 6 months or so to let early adopters like me help samsung get the bugs worked out  .
on the positive side the tech support person i have talked to 4 times who is in south carolina has a wonderful southern accent and is very nice , cannot say enough good things about her and i work with tech supports all day in my job the problem seems to me to be that samsung just does not have enough feedback at this time to fix the problems  .
i have done the firmware upgrade and it seems to have fixed the motion flicker problem and the store mode problem netflix still does not work , apparently a software upgrade is coming  .
the 3d starter kit has not arrived so i cannot comment on the 3d feature .
willing to give it another try .
between the frames on the 3d glasses and the frame around the tv it is like looking into a tunnel  .
not enjoyable at all .
lg's new infinia 3d tvs are an actual upgrade from hdtv in terms of image quality because of the thx certification  .
for roughly the same price range , you can truly upgrade your tv , not just get 3d capability .
buy any samsung tv (lcd plasma whatever) at your own peril  .
run away  .
cnet you know this  .
how can you even recommend samsung at all  .
after losing three pixels on the first two of these i purchased , i returned it and purchased a sony 55 hx 800 for a substantially better looking tv  .
the samsung has great appeal being an inch thick , stainless finish , and 3d ready , but the overall performance is bad after i got it home  .
ultimate electronics in phoenix took care of my exchange stating that they had no problems with the samsung but believed the sony is a better set for the money  .
never buy a samsung again .
before you buy any samsung tv do an internet search for samsung tv power supply problems  .
you'll find many complaints about a capacitor issue  .
be sure to buy an extended warranty .
Fair price. Good picture. Felt as though attending live performances of TV shows.; Quit working in 17 days.
It says Samsung on the front. Great picture quality. nice design. great specs. ultra slim.; A bit pricey. 3d quality could be better. wish it made smoothies (with all its features im surprised it doesnt).
Fantastic picture; Capacitors are too weak. Go out within two years - usually less. TV turns on and off over and over and will not stay on. Many techs do not know how to repair properly. DREAM to NIGHTMARE just after warranty expires.
Great picture, very thin and light weight, easy to set-up, 3D is Cool.; Nothing that should keep you from buying one.
Basic tv meets your HD and 3D needs, but can be improved; Image quality is not an improvement from previous HDTV models. The only bonus is 3D capability.
Great features, 3D image looks amazing..even using the 2D to 3D option. Lots of online app. Very very think, which allows for great custom cabinet setup.; Need to buy the 3D glass's to use 3D...would have been nice to have at least one included.
Love the picture, when the set is working. Good color, good blacks, audio not great but better than I expected.; Keeps defaulting to "Store Mode" plus motion flicker. NetFlix doesn't work, apparently software upgrade coming.
The picture is simply great on both satellite and internet. Everyone in the room can view the 2D picture the comments regarding the angle of view...it is a non-issue. The slim design is better than the other brands especially Sony and Vizio.; The Glowing Samsung Logo took some gettting us to and the remote is rather complex so we go a Logitech.
The TV is very thin and nice. The colors are beautiful and contrast is sharp. Deep blacks. Looks stylish and futuristic. HD TV, video games, and blu ray movies look awesome.; The price is expensive. Internet firmware issues with Netflix and Blockbuster is annoying. Did not come with the touch screen remote control. 3D blu ray content is limited. 3D glasses are very expensive. No Facebook internet app.
High black levels, asthetics, 3D compatible, brightness, size and depth, advanced settings, sound is better than expected, 8,000,000:1 contrast, 4 HDMI ports, numerous applications, great color, 240hz, quick refresh.; Ugly base, some 3D content has double imaging issue with background items, people do not like watching tv with glasses, some individuals have issues with userability, tv leans forward when using base, the adapter for the component video.
The picture on the 55C8000 is just amazing. Bright, clear, stunning picture. Sound is also good.; Only one coax connection. Reflects some light in bright room but not at all a problem. To be honest I was having trouble coming up with CONS.
Beautiful picture - 2D/3D, smooth motion processing, elegant frame and body styling, deep colors / high contrast, internet capable for widgets and firmware updates, and countless picture customization for custom tweaking geeks.; Off angle viewing does lighten picture but this is the case with most LCD/LEDs. As with all thin LEDs the TV stand doesn't feel sturdy enough. Motion clarity is great but while watching Wall-E I notice a little stutter when the camera is panning.
The picture is second to none, crystal clear images, very nice and simple to use remote(not sure why some people are knocking it), blu ray movies look surreal, brushed chrome looks very sharp.; Should have come with a 3d capable hdmi cable, and really should have come with at least 2 pairs of glasses, price still steep but there is deals to be had if you look around
Colars are bright and eye catching, beats every tv out thier with colar, clarity is off the charts to you can notice the smallist details fine. and under one inch thick its a stunner.; My only complaint comes with the motion, first of all i like the soap opera look because it gives you amaing clarity even in fast scenes. however it seems to handle 24fps somewhat badly, some scences will become a tad jerky maling motion clarity less
Picture quality and LED lighting is 4 to 4.5 stars; Possible power supply problem after just one day of use. TV in stanby mode with red power light indicated on the front, but will not turn on with remote or TV itself.
I agree with pretty much everything in the CNET review, but might be a little less critical of the overall picture quality which I thought was quite good. Okay, not as good as my big plasma, but acceptable.; 55 inches is too small for 3D and I don't think 65 would be a big improvement. There was no OMG is this ever good at any point during the movie.
Clarity is outstanding, and the converter from 2D to 3D on Movies and TV is the biggest plus. The Finish is great on the edging. Remote is easy to use and controls the 3d Player through BD-link... one remote to control both items.; So far the cons are.. User manual not enough information and clarity and you cant seem to turn off the other sources displays on the screen even though not being used. have to buy the wireless usb.. Comes on 3D players but not on TV?
ALOT of color,upgraded firm just works better 3D rocks internet access contrast @ 8,000,000 :1means great black, Deluxe frame and image quality. people complains about blur 3d images I think its like the cinema, they need to improve but for me is ok; Expensive, need more 3d content, remote sucks and if you are buying an expensive TV you must deserve a premium remote don't you think?
Blueray looks AMAZING!!! Really, you feel as though you are actually there and the depth of each frame is something you won't see on a lesser quality TV. The picture is very bright and natural looking. The colors are truly fantastic.; The sound isn't all that great On HD shows, there is a strange effect which I have seen described as soap opera effect. It's sort of odd. The clarity is unsurpassed, but there is something not right.
