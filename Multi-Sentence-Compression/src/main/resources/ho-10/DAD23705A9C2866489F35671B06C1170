the hotel 's sister property in shane , the conyngham arms hotel is well worth a visit with an excellent bistro restaurant , a roaring fire and of course a great pint of guinness .
we were also shown a couple of the 6 rooms in the main house which are beautifully decorated with wonderful views over the estate and would be a good choice .
this was not the case as most of the ingredients had clearly be pre-cooked and sat long enough to dry out , so the bacon , sausage and irish black pudding were all dried out .
the kitchen is fully equipped with a supply of coffee , tea , snacks and fresh milk in the fridge .
the main house itself has some beautifully appointed sitting rooms which are a wonderful spot to sit back and relax with a good book .
having your own living room/kitchen/diner plus double bedroom and bathroom upstairs is great value for the price of what normally only gets you a hotel room .
unfortunately , as noted by other reviewers , the breakfast was just the opposite and a real disappointment .
we had dinner in the brabazon restaurant which again at eur45 per head for a 5 course dinner was outstanding value .
when promised a `` full irish breakfast '' at this level the least you can expect is that it be freshly cooked to order .
the hotel is close to some fascinating sites to visit , such as newgrange and slane castle .
