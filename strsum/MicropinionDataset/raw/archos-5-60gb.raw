Pros:. I think this is one of the best &lt;a href= "www.movieplayer.co.za"&gt; movie players&lt;/a&gt; I have seen in a long time! The touchscreen function is excellent and its durable yet fashionable.. 
Cons:. Its a bit pricey!. 

$$;
Pros:. In comparison to IPod Touch 1.Larger support of audio and video formats . 2. Better video display and resolution.3. Better sound quality (s/n ratio ~82 dB for IPT it is 71 dB). 4. Higher storage (min 60GB and max 250GB. IPT max 32GB). 
Cons:. It is a little bulky or should I say so especially after admiring the wonderful screen I am sort of able to forget the bulk part. 
Summary:. In the hardware part this product is more superior than any in the market and a 60GB model comes cheaper than the IPod Touch. It is in a different league than the IPT which just doesn't match up to the capabilities of this player. It excells in all the features and qualities that can be proved e.g formats supported, quality of audio and video, basic hardware, storage and price.. The only areas that one may argue on are interface and size, which are not areas by which you can rate a product better than another because these two factors are pure personal preference factors and in an age when almost everyone carries a laptop a little weight is quite an accepted thing. Besides when you learn to appreciate the brilliant high resolution screen you just tend to forget about the weight. The IPT is just robbing people of their hard earned money because when compared to this product it is not worth even 70% of its present price.. Overall this product has more to give in total media satisfaction than any in the market. After using the IPT for almost a year I decided to change over. I bought mine along with the DVR station and the possibilities are limitless. I am able to surf the internet on my 50 inch LCD TV with the remote plus record my favourite movies from the TV. Besides I have some hard drives with all my songs and movies recorded on them and all I do is connect the hard drive to this DVR station and then watch the movies through the Archos 5 and even listen to the music. This is fantastic. It just goes to sat that you are not limited to the 250 GB space. you may buy numerous hard drives and record more songs and movies and play them through the Archos 5.. In my personal opinion the IPT looks more sexy and the interface is slightly (when compared to the Archos 5 with the latest firmware) more responsive. The earlier problems with the internet etc have been sorted out. None of the 2 players are pocketable. You have to carry them on a pouch on your waist. Even though the IPT is smaller still it is not comfortable in your pocket.. I would reccommend this product to all high end audio and video lovers and people with a taste for good music because you can rip all your high quality CD's into Flac files and play them on the Archos. The IPT has a long way to go with high quality sound format. At this moment no compressed format of sound can give you a higher dynamic range and quality in comparison to flac. If you are a person who just downloads music from the net then you may want to stick with the IPT.. 

$$;
Pros:. Absolutely everything about this device is spectacular, from the HD factor to the internet speed. 
Cons:. It doesn't tuck me in at night when I go to sleep? Aside from that ...there are very few cons when you purchase a functioning IMT.. 
Summary:. I've been with Archos from day 1...through all of the PVP's and this tops them all. From the networking factor to the audio which has improved drastically since the 605wifi.. The sleek factor is also a plus. Buying the plug ins is easy but not necessary if you just need the interent and web tv...whiich is free upon registration of the device. We had to purchase the Opera browser with the 605 wifi. Acess to desktop shortcuts are sweet as well. Bravo Archos...job well done!.

Pros:. afgafgagfgafgafgafgafga. 
Cons:. ***********************. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen size, Batter life not that bad(better than many i have seen), Best cpu on the market, great music quality, highest screen resolution on pmps... if that doesn't convince you then you are an idiot!. 
Cons:. the bad thing i have seen is... fingerprints but you would not have any music/video player without a case so you can't break the screen or damage the player!. 
Summary:. Best product out there, way better price and any ipod and can access and wifi area... so my standing is clear.. 

$$;
Pros:. Free Internet Radio and TV. Super Sharp screen, plays any video file, web browser fast than an iPod. Starts at 60GB.. 
Cons:. The email client acts fluky. They say it will be updated in next software release.. 
Summary:. OK, what the heck are the reviewers talking about? Did they take it with them everywhere, sleep with it, eat with it like I did. First off, the battery life is like way better than 4 hours on video. I put the screen brightness down to the middle level and got 5 1/2 hours of video playback. Why buy a dedicated internet radio from Terratec or Asus for $200-400 when it comes free on the Archos (OK, ya have to register to get it - big deal). 800x480 pixel screen is sharper than a tack - not seen anything better and any portable device. It plays .swf and .flv files. iPod cannot. This is major man!! I got the DVR Station and I play flash games on in my Sony 32" TV. Internet is lot faster than on the old 605 from last year. Don't know why davemhead couldn't get wifi working. Works great for me. Oh yeah, and you can get it in 250 friggen gigabytes! Archos plays full size DVD movie files and HD playpack plug-in to come. Hmmm, $349 for both itouch and Archos5. One has 32GB the other 60GB of storage. One plays flash game files and flash videos, the other doesn't. One does fake tricks to show you an internet site, the other shows you a real website. Excellent web and video portable device. The DVR Station really shows the beauty of the video playback watching it on a tv. Highly highly recommend this, it will not dissapoint (I read all 97 pages of their manual too, I bet cnet didn't). It rocketh my brethern, it rocketh.. 

$$;
Pros:. Features, autonomy, screen, form factor and design, included program guide, recording features, HDMI output on DVR, USB host, PTP compatible with cameras. 
Cons:. No cons, not event one.. 
Summary:. This review just confirms my already made opinion that one should never read reviews about products. Journalists do not know what they are talking about and after these so called reviews you always get a bunch of complaining people that are not educated enough to use gadgets and technology. Let me tell you that I do not have problems to connect to my home wireless network, to Starbucks and Mac Donalds networks. And yes I get 4:30 hours video autonomy and roughly 20 hours music playback. Some stuff will be improved for sure with upcoming firmware updates, this is how todays technology works. This review of the Archos5 should never be published and my advise is that if you want an internet media tablet that rocks, then just get one and forget dummy people. Oups and one last thing. This gadget is the only one on the market that enables me to see and copy all the pictures I'm taking with the iPhone right on the Archos5's hard drive. Amazing!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Significantly better screen than both the Ipod Touch and 605. Actual tested battery life for video is more around 5.5 hours. Sound quality is significantly better than previous models. The screen is beautiful!. 
Cons:. Unit has beta firmware for now and is a fingerprint magnet.. 
Summary:. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best screen in the world, best processor in the world, best storage in the world, best codecs support in the world (now with HD), HSDPA (with Dongle), Flash video support in the browser Youtube/Dailymotion/GoogleVideo.... 
Cons:. The Archos 5G is going to be even better cause it has the HSDPA built-in, but storage, pricing and availabillity of the 5G model is not available yet.. Current firmware is slightly buggy, but should be fixed in firmware updates soon.. 
Summary:. Donald Bell posts several errors in his review. Video resolution support is 720x576 without the HD 1280x720 plugin installed, not 640x480. The Archos 5 has several advantages over the iPod Touch and the Archos 605 WiFi, not the other way around. Archos is the only company supporting Flash video the way they do, in pure full screen streaming. Try getting full Youtube, Dailymotion, Google Video, Myspace TV and more support on any other device the way this one does it.. The browser on the Archos 5 is 5 times faster then the iPhone 3G or iPod Touch browser. I don't know what Donald Bell has smoked when he is saying that the web browser dissapoints. Sure it's got 1 or 2 bugs in the current firmware, but it loads NYT.com in less then 3 seconds, Engadget.com in less then 5 seconds, it requires no horizonthal scrolling because of the 800x480 resolution screen.. Sure the mail client is currently beta, but it works fine for me. And you can easilly load the full AJAX version of Gmail anyways in the browser and use that very effectively.. Other then recommending people to consider getting the Archos 5G with built-in HSDPA, if that suits their HSDPA needs and convenience of having HSDPA built-in. Only thing I would say the Archos 5 currently misses is support for third party applications. But just as Apple took a while to release their app store as a firmware update, I am confident that Archos can release support for Android applications at some point in the next few months. This would make this device even more future proof, and would replace the need to buy an Android phone or an iPhone just to get access to HSDPA based social networking and instant messaging applications.. Also I believe this totally trashes the iPhone, cause you don't need a big screen on your phone. Just use a very cheap other $8 phone in your other pocket for your basic voice needs. And then anything that is about video or using the Internet, the Archos 5 is the best solution ever made..

Pros:. -Everything. 
Cons:. -Should have more games. -Should Have its own music store. 
Summary:. I don't know where to buy this product,(besides the internet, but I want to buy it in stores) but I am sure this is one of the best products coming out this year. As soon as it comes out of Circuit city (if...), I munna go buy one!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Internet access, Lots of space (120gig model), excellent sound, excellent video, and i found tech support to be very helpful and not hard to get a hold of.. 
Cons:. weight but then again it is the bigger model, battery life could be better but i have it on for about 10 hours a day with only haveing it to charge it at night.. 
Summary:. Excellent product. I really don't think cnet even looked at this product. Sense they are in bed with apple any more. So you have to take everything they say about a product that isn't apple with a grain of salt. I found far better reviews on a website called www.anythingbutipod.com. So if you want a good MP3 go their..

Cons:. Average battery life; average sound quality;. 
Summary:. I have had this unit for a month &#38; 1/2 now, and I could not be more pleased with its performance; it does everything as advertized; the unit is multi purpose; has excellent storage capaticy; and can handle almost anything you throw into it; getting free web; wifi; audio / video podcasts; streaming radio signals form all over the world seems limitless. Videos &#38; pic's look amazing on the Archos 4.8" screen; e-mail works effortlessly; internet is faster then my desk top. The Archos media club offers unlimited free downloads for music; and if you log on to the Archos Fans web site you will find many answers to questions and or suggustions that you may be looking for; this product has exceeded my expectations and I find it much better then the 605 model. I would not hesitate to reccommend the Archos 5. I personally think that it is currently one of the best IMT's on the market.. Cheers. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely high-quality display (I get compliments all the time). Great multi-functionality (this thing can do pretty much everything). Easy to use. Endless customization options (minus an important one.. read cons). 
Cons:. Still a little glitchy. Cant customize menus. Poor Support (if you need it..). Not as many third-party add-ons as Ipod. 
Summary:. First off let me say I have read many reviews of the product, watched videos, read the manual, and did a lot of research before buying. I read what many reviewers commented as "bad" things about it, and I have found through personal experience that most of them are not true and are based solely on a faulty device rather than a working one. Granted they should be tested to work correctly before shipping, but still you can't give a product a bad review because you happened to get one that was broken. Get it replaced then review.. Assuming you have already read the Cnet review: you know what this thing can do and so my review is aimed at giving counter-arguments to the bad things some people say.. First of all, many reviews of the product comment on glitches. They note that it crashes a lot or has some other kind of processing issue. But you must know that these reviews were done when the product was first released. Since then Archos has provided many firmware updates which fix most issues. I've had it for over a week and it has only crashed once because I was trying to load too many websites at a time. A glitch? Yes. A big deal? Not at all.. The battery life on the Archos is always increasing with firmware updates. The product now states "22 hours audio; 8 hours video" and I can personally attest to the battery life. I started playing music in the morning; it played all day and through a party at night, and was still playing when I woke up the next morning. Over 22 hours.. The touch screen is very responsive. Many times I am amazed when I click a small link on a website expecting it not to work and the Archos knows what I clicked. It is really a joy to use.. Added cost of plug-ins? Yes its true that some file types require additional plug-ins to play. However, I have never encountered one of these file types because they are the less-common ones. All of my music files and videos have worked. If you do have some files which are a different type just use a free conversion tool on your computer and convert them to a working type. It's really not that hard, and it?s free.. Added cost of add-ons? I DO NOT understand why people complain about this. So you have to pay $90 for the DVR add-on. How much would a stand-alone DVR cost? A few hundred at least. You pay less money, and it?s more convenient because it?s all in one device. Archos never claimed it could do this out-of-the-box, so you have nothing to complain about miss-representation. I will challenge you to buy an mp3 player, a video player, a PDA, and a DVR and I will guarantee you that you will pay more money than if you had just bought the Archos and the DVR add-on. (Assuming you buy products that are similar, not a 1MB mp3 player and a 1gig video player, obviously). A proprietary USB cable... I'm pretty sure all Ipods also use one and I haven't seen CNET complain about that. Biased much?. Fingerprint magnet... Yes the back (of the 60gb only, the larger ones have a rubber-like backing) gets fingerprints. But why are you looking at the back instead of the screen on the front?. The front does as well, but I would hope you would put a protective cover on it (as you would with any device with a large exposed screen) which will drastically reduce or eliminate this. So watch out those of you watching your wallets, this may cost you a whole 3 more dollars.. Final Notes:. Yes there are still some glitches, but these are constantly being addressed via firmware updates, so don?t let that scare you away from this great device. This is the only reason I gave the product a 4.5 instead of 5 star rating.. People who post reviews full of only bad things probably got a bad unit. If they would have just taken it back for a new one and posted the review after I'm sure their review would be much different. Again, I agree Archos should test them before shipping, but it?s not a perfect world. If you happen to be one of the unlucky few, just take it back for a working one. It may be a small inconvenience but it?s not worth ditching the Archos altogether.. Hope this puts some of the false and/or exaggerated complaints to rest..

Pros:. the videos look amazing, the music sound great, the photos look great, have a web browser also you can red your email and reads pdf files. 
Cons:. the divice easy gets fingerprints in the back and the front so the divice look ugly that why you need to buy a leather case and a screen protector. the web browser doesn't support some web aps. 
Summary:. it's cool that also have a web browser but the fingerprints around the divice are really bad but you can watch videos also if you download the cinema plug in you can wacth movies and if you buy the dvr adapter you con record your favorite tv shows. 

$$;
Pros:. Features,gorgeous huge screen,intuitive...very small learning curve.. 
Cons:. Have to buy proprietory add ons for certain features that add a LOT to the price. 
Summary:. I think my pros and cons pretty much said it all...now for a reality check for the no brainers (they must have NONE!) who try to write an (AHEM!) knowledgeable review of a product that they have never even held in their hands...RIDICULOUS!. Please keep your uninformed OPINIONS to yourself and review only products you really have first hand knowledge of! Anything else is just guesswork.. 

$$;
Pros:. it's advertised features. 
Cons:. some flash player problems. beta firmware (hopefully to be fixed). smudgy. 
Summary:. I own the ipod touch 1G and the Archos 5 as of 4 days ago. i've played around with it and it's absolutely awesome. keyboard is nice and better than the ipod touch and the video and music quality is a lot better. however the interface of the ipod touch is better. archos 5's interface isn't bad but it's not the best. other than its interface and the fact that it's still beta. i prefer the Archos 5. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen, great finish, comfortable size,connects to internet in a reasonable time. 
Cons:. OS issue (this system keeps freezing up or rebooting on its own), can't watch videos at web sites like hulu, joost, msntv, etc.. games you purshase from the archos store are at the very least LAME. No HDTV snap-on for free digital brodcast in the US.. 
Summary:. The Archos 5 isn't worth the money. It a product that looks pretty with great features that works very well when the unit doesn't freeze up or reboots on it's own. It has applications that I love and want in a pmp but the program that it runs under is unstable. This is hard for me to accept because the OS is Lynx and Lynx is great. I bought my Archos 5 on Oct. 30th 2008. In Jan 2009 the unit started to freeze up on me or just restart on it's own. At times I could be browsing for up to 4-5 hrs. without an issues, other times I could just be on for 10 min and it freezes up. I tried to send my unit to Archos to get fixed and the customer service is ridiculous. First I usually have to wait for at least 30min before someone picks up and through out the whole waiting period I keep getting this message saying "sorry for the wait but we are experiencing unusuall high call volume". This happens everytime I call. Do I have bad luck, bad timeing, or is this the norm for Archos customer service?. In my personal experience it's the norm......customer srevice is a nightmare (my longest wait on hold was 48 min). Once connected to a customer rep half the time you know more about the unit then they do. I had tried 3x to have my unit fixed. 1st in Jan, then April, then in July. The first 2x's I got my unit back with in 2 weeks. the 3rd time i waited 5 weeks before I got my unit back. I was told that the CNP (the motherboard) needs to be replace because it was malfunctioning. Now keep in mind that it took them from Jan to July and 2 previous attempts to repair the unit to find out it was the motheboard. So I got my unit back in Sept (I sent the unit out for the final repair in the last week of July). I was told that my unit will be shipped to me fixed, instead it was another refurbished unit that went bad within the first 10 min. As i was trying to load a desktop background and a message popped up saying "hard disk error check RO". I once again called Archos, waited 38 mins (and yes it still had that anoying recording about unusaual heavey call volume) and told the customer rep that this isn't my unit because the serial # didn't match. To make an extemely long story short I ended up talking with the tech support manager. He appologized and said that MY unit will be sent and fixed because HE personally will do the work. Well I was happy none the less because i felt I finally got someone who cared and was being honest. Well I got the unit about 1 week later and again it wasn't mine. It was another refurbished unit. This time the unit worked well untill thursday oct 22. This time the unit said "file error: fat is corrupt". Now here we are again for the 4th time trying to get the unit fixed. I called and waited the usual long hold time. An rma was done and I sent my unit out on Saturday to be repaired for the 4th time. The 1st archos I bought was the 405, then the 505, then I upgraded to the 605wifi ( I had similar issues with the 605wifi) so when I saw the Archos 5 IMT I HAD TO HAVE IT. I gave the 605wifi to my sister( which she doesn't use because of the issues with the os) and bought the archos 5 IMT thinking that this unit would be better and stable. That will be my last purchase from Archos. I will not be upgrading to the new archos 5. The head ache from customer support isn't worth the unit. Archos has a product with great potential but with bad customer support and an unstable OS it isnt worth it. Maybe if Archos Corp in Denver, Co or the flagship office in France reads this review they may step in to improve customer service in Illinois and keep customers happy. If this happens then I may return for future purchases. Or maybe if we can all bypass the US market and buy it directly from France. A firmware update with. flash to help watch videos in hulu, joost, msntv, etc. would also be great as well as being able to watch HD brodcast in the US not just in Europe (one of the reasons I bought the Archos 5 was because of the HDTV snap-on that was suppose to be availiable in Feb 09. Archos in France pulled the plug on that)..

Summary:. Very good PMP in the market but some fix should be made to become best one against ITouch.. 

$$;
Pros:. The 250 gigs of storage and the MSC support automatically makes it better than any player that doesn't support MSC.. 
Cons:. I agree with all the cons mentioned in CNET's review. Archos ruins potentially awesome products with easily avoidable flaws that even the lamest companies would laugh at. Bad customer service.. 
Summary:. First off, let me tell you that I don't own one. But I have done enough research to know almost as much as an owner. I've asked all the questions I can think of on message boards, read through the manual, watched every video out there, read all the reviews, etc. I also have an AV380, and it looks like the UI, at least for audio and video playback, is still essentially the same, underneath all the flashy enhancements (they have since added the ability to browse by ID3 tag attributes, which I'd never want to do but I'm sure some people prefer). I'm actually glad they haven't changed this aspect, because I love the simplicity of the way the archos UI works for playing media. There are a few things I'd add or improve, but as it is, I think it destroys most of the competition in this respect. I couldn't imagine being forced to browse by ID3 tags, especially the way that it seems to be implemented on the ipod and zune... I only have limited experience using friends ipods and zunes, but as far as I can tell, when you browse to an album, you get a freaking list of alphabetized song titles, sans track numbers. So you can't even tell the order of the songs on the album. It's insane to me that something so flawed can be so popular, but I guess if you don't know any better.... Too bad the only mp3 player on the market that I could see purchasing was ruined by archos' inability to make competent decisions. I can't imagine using a PMP with less than 120 GB of storage, or having to install some flashy wannabe windows explorer bloatware (*cough*itunes*cough*) that would bog down my computer, inhibit my ability to transfer my media files between my PMP and as many devices as I want, and not allow me to manage my files myself.. With those two retardedly simple requirements (lots of storage and MSC), the only products available are made by archos. However, archos makes incredibly idiotic design decisions (like putting the 3.5 mm jack in the middle of the side) that could easily be avoided if they actually tried using it and gave some thought to these flaws and how easily they could be fixed. Sure, they could say "it's not a big deal that the jack is in the middle", and they'd be semi-correct. But is it a big deal to move it to a corner? Basically, every negative point that CNET pointed out I completely agree with. I also think anyone with 5% of a brain would notice these flaws after using the thing for 5 minutes. Apparently archos thinks its customers are its test team, although they fail to listen to their test team because I see many of the same problems being complained about with each generation of players that they release. That, or they notice the problems on their own but don't care enough to fix them.. Archos also has worthless customer service. Don't bother attempting to make any sort of contact with them. I've experienced this first hand with my AV380 and in trying to gain information about the archos 5. You'd think they'd at least want to help a potential customer.. If this thing was easily pocketable I'd probably be able to overlook all of it's ridiculous shortcomings, but it's not. Maybe Cowon will release a replacement for the X5 with a higher capacity HD..

Pros:. -Great screen. -Easy navigation. -Works with many video / audio formats. -Web browser, email and web radio / TV. 
Cons:. -Low volume levels. -Infrequent updates to correct problems. -Web flash completely obsolete. 
Summary:. The Archos 5 is a nice media player that gives you music, video and web content with a nice interface. The external speaker is weak, and earphones are necessary, however the volume is insufficient for any noisy environment. While it's a nice player, and works well enough, the biggest reason to NOT get the Archos 5 is the overall product support. With the release of the Archos 5 IMT, the company is pushing all of their resources to that product, and no longer providing updates for the Archos 5 and 7 (even though these products are still sold as new). To compound matters, the Opera browser doesn't work with the latest flash, so sites like Youtube will not work. An email to Archos garnered this reply:. The reason that you are getting this error is because a lot of sites, such asYouTube, have upgraded to Flash 10. Currently, Flash 9 is the only flash player available on the unit. We are waitingfor Adobe to release the software for Flash 10 to us, and as soon as it is available an update will be published. There is no way to upgrade the flash player until this update is made available. We apologize for any inconvenience.. For an internet based product, lack of a competent browser makes the Archos 5 mediocre. If indeed Archos is waiting patiently for Abode to step up to the plate, I can *completely* understand Apple not wanting to integrate Flash into the iPad. Complaints from Adobe are unfounded if they cannot keep their commitments to an existing customers base.. As is the Archos 5 is a music / movie player with limited internet usage. it's a deal on sale, but for full price it's better to move on to something that works with today's internet. It would be great to see CNET bring up this type of point when comparing the Adobe / Apple debate..

Pros:. Great Sound,. Great Picture Quality,. Best looking player on the market,. Dedicated volume rocker,. No Additional Software Needed,. Simple user interface,. Surprisingly responsive touch screen,. Durable steel shell,. 
Cons:. Below Average Battery Life. The lack of buttons for things like track skipping tracks. Extras cost extra. Mine died after a week of use.. 
Summary:. What can I say... I loved this thing for the week that it worked. It was real eye and ear candy. And then a week later (a week of babying by the way) it froze and never woke up. It was with a heavy heart that I returned it to the shop and picked up my second Zune... Which I love..

Pros:. Nice unit when it works properly.. 
Cons:. Quality!! Exactly one year to the day the hard drive failed. I waited over an hour on the phone and some one came on saying they will call me back in a few hours. I've sent an email regarding my unit needing repair yesterday and no response as yet.. 
Summary:. The product is great when it works. But for the money and price I expected much better quality and especially much better customer service. Looks are only skin deep.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast, flexible and nice user interface. Lots of cool, probably useless accessories.. 
Cons:. GPS Cradle big, clunky, and the software crashes when you approach state lines. What is worse is getting that fixed. You can't. They will reformat (lobotomize) you Archos, but they can't seem to fix anything.. 
Summary:. No kidding. GPS crashes when used to travel from point A to point B. It is a great accessory for telling where you are - but you had better stay put or it will crash. Service replaced the defective GPS with another defective unit and wiped everything from the Archos itself, including the paid, one-download only, DRM protected files. They did say we could return the stuff for a 15% restock fee. If you want to spend a lot of money and have little to nothing to show for it this product is for you.. BTW: The have a bridge Brooklyn for sale as well .... 

$$;
Pros:. The web sites look awesome, while they work,hotmail capable,no download to hard drive but you can save pictures and download free music from archos also u can store saved web sites on a file read them later,better resolution than itouch,moving thumbs. 
Cons:. I use it at low light but on medium after 2 music videos u loose a square on the battery meter,the video recording is the same as the 605,the wifi reception and speed is worst than I touch,but on the street.. YouTube glitches due to wifi reception. 
Summary:. The 600mhz speed of the cortex is not as fast as they hype I think the itouch is faster on the Internet.the resolution, size of screen, harddrive, value,drag and drop dvix avi and h264 upto 720x480 most downloaded videos are on these formats,password protected notes on free offline widgets,you can use nail or stylus on screen to evade finger prints,itouch can't use a object other than your finger,"hope they come up with a drawing widget". tv recording that can be set at any time while you are at work you can record a game from any time to any time just by leaving the channel on in a VCR out to the device and setting it by the clock and leaving it pluged in (the free DVR snap on has no out to tv to see what's recorded for that you need to but the dvr station but it has a DC input that is compatible with the 605 dvr DC plug so you can use it to charge quicker , works as hardrive to drag and drop anything,rename and edit of files on the device no need of software like iTunes,any pic wallpaper option even moving ones,digital tv antenna snap on soon available,speaker not as good as the 605,equalizer is good,also the video adjust on screen while playing can't be done on the itouch,I have both so I know that both have good qualities,. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture when its not locked up and looks nice unit. 
Cons:. really bad software/hardware unit locks up bad tech support only by email no wall charger included and USB charger takes 8+ hours to charge unit. 
Summary:. do not buy one till Archos fixs software/hardware problems and supplies a wall charger as part of purchase. i paid $699 Australian Dollars you would think unit would be A1. furthermore you could play a game called find the master reset button.. took me 30 mins to find it, its so small you cant see it techncal book marked it in the wrong spot. i very sad i brought it two days ago. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the big screen, hate the support. 
Cons:. Call product support at 4:30 EDT and at 4:45 disconnected with the message that support is 7am-11pm cst and they have closed...several phone calls over many days and never gotten to talk to anyone...allows account sign on on net at home but not thru. 
Summary:. Can sign on my account at home computer bu not thruthe archos...every streaming video site I go to says the video I choose is not available...HULU but they work on the home computer!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen. So good that anyone that see it immedaitely wants to know where they can get one! Great audio. Nice interface. Smooth video playback. Large 60 gig hard drive.. 
Cons:. Will not work at a wifi hot spot other than your home, Panera bread, and your local library! Released with beta firmware! Long battery charge time. Doesn't come with a charger-Must use USB charger unless you buy a power cord or charging dock.. 
Summary:. The screen is amazing. It sounds amazing when you use good quality headphones and play mp3 that have not been compressed too much. Video playback is smooth. Touch screen is responsive and just big enough to type on. I can't imagine using anything smaller. (like the IPOD touch). The deal breaker is, the adds make you think you can use this player at any wifi hotspot. YOU CANNOT! I have verified this at Starbucks, Barnes &#38; Noble and McDonalds. WHAT A PITY! That is the whole reason I got it. Archos needs to address thei grave oversight immedaitly. Most people already have an ipod. A lot of people will be buying this to get Internet on the go. They will be foreced to go to their local libray and Panera bread. (Those are the only free connections in my area). And, and one more thing. It does not work with large jpg files. I have a Canon 40d and uploaded some of my pics just to see what they would look like on the screen. The Archos could not deal with these files. They were too big. The problem is easily solvable though. Just downsize your pics to under a meg and they should display properly and the slide show feature will work.. Bottom line: if you are getting Archos 5 for Internet on the go, you should be looking at the Ipod touch. Yes, the Ipod touch doesn't have flash at the moment, but at least it will let you sign onto the Internet at more then just your house, Panera bread, and your a public library!. Come on Archos! You really dropped the ball with your Internet feature! Please fix this ASAP.. Why one star for my rating? Because I feel like they should mention on their website that you cannot connect to certain wifi connections. I shouldn't have to find this out by buying the product and testing it out myself. They already knew information but they sold us these things anyway! That is sneaky and I don't appreciate getting duped by their marketing department.. I saw in an Archos 605 review that they don't support the above mentioned wifi spots. But, I was hoping that they would have addressed this very important matter by now. Sadly, they have not!. 

$$;
Pros:. nonthing i like. is just junk device. 
Cons:. believe me you will not find HORRIBLE support like archos. indeed, it is the worst. 1 month waiting and nothing fix. i sent letter to tell them the device still broken and i hope to fix it. they just talk we wil. it the worst. avoid junk ARCHOS. 
Summary:. believe me you will not find HORRIBLE support like archos. indeed, it is the worst. 1 month waiting and nothing fix. as well they said the speaker is good, realy i did not say any thing about speaker. i said the slot of headphone is broken. no problem may be mistake. i sent letter to tell them the device still broken and i hope to fix it. they just talk we wil, will. now 2 month and nothing. this is my email. ababab567@gmail.com. if some want evidace i will show him. almost more than 10 problem from them. enjoy onther good device and avoid junk ARCHOS. 

$$;
Pros:. Great concept: WiFi, TV, Browsing... The last product Archos had that I would give at least a 5-star rating was the old FM Recorder 20. I bought that thing back in the early 2000's.. 
Cons:. Archos has the same problems it always had with its video products...Glitchy, Crashes, and horrible Customer Service. Add paying more for Add-ons. I simply do not believe anyone who has given this product a 4 or 5-star rating. See Summary.. 
Summary:. All you have to do is look at the history of reviews for Archos products and they all virtually have the same Cons...Glitchy, Crashes and Horrible Customer Service. Compare this to the 4 and 5-star ratings and you will see how consistent the Cons are and how INconsistent the 4 &#38; 5-star ratings are. The Gmini may be one exception. This should tell you that those 4 &#38; 5-star Reviewers are not real customers. Archos has consistently proven that it does not care about quality or the customer. All it sees is if the profits outweigh the losses. I have PROMPTLY returned this product before having to pay the 15% Restocking fee.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good product lot of functions. 
Cons:. Expensive, need to buy plug in and other things to use it effectively. I sent to reparation and after 2 months they still have to start repairing.. Check yourself if you dont trust. www.repair.archos.com. EAD-01-09020432275. 
Summary:. Don�t buy. If you are unlucky and need to send it back you will never see it again. 

$$;
Pros:. Does everything that it says it does, but in an extremely limited manner.. 
Cons:. If u think it has a better browser than the iPhone or iPod touch, u gotta be kidding. Hard Drive is extremely slow, and it doesn't play all video formats, and sometimes, it randomly doesn't play some videos for no reason. Crashes alot, for no reason.. 
Summary:. If you are buying this for its internet browser, web TV, and online streaming, STOP NOW! I bought the 250GB one and I am in the process of selling it on eBay right now. Also, The HD is very slow, and ur archos will restart alot. I converted all my movies to AVI formats, including some TV shows, and mysteriously, some of the seasons of my favorite TV shows don't work. And I tried converting them again and it would give me the same problem. Customer support sucks compared to Apple. It really isn't worth the cost, and you pay so much more for plug ins, and equipments. DONT BUY IT..
