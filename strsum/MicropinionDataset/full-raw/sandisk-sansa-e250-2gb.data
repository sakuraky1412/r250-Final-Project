i thought my cowon f2 had excellent sound , but i have come to prefer my sansa e250 , v  .
the cowon has great detail , but the sansa has a warmer , more natural sound , while still revealing the fine detail the cowon plays lossless files such as flac and ogg , but so does the sansa with the rockbox os ; it also plays ape files , though this does not seem to be documented (shhh  .
once you play a lossless file , you hear just how good the sansa can be , which is audiophile grade the rockbox program is easy to install  .
the expansion in features to the sansa is mind boggling , including a parametric equalizer  .
it adds bookmarking and the ability to play music while connected to a laptop my only gripes do not concern performance   the case is a bit slippery    it could use a little rubberized surface ring , and the battery , while replaceable , is not replaceable on the fly my biggest concern is the proprietary connection means not being able to use the sansa to upload files on the go  .
if you lose it , you're dead  .
sansa should have at least included a small sansa to usb adapter , in addition to the cord , for traveling , as cowon does i should note that the sansa e250 version 2 (firmware v  .
3) has different electronics  .
i suspect they may have gone to a digital amplifier that would change the sound quality , but who knows  .
and rockbox does not work with the v  .
2 (3) , only v  .
1 given that the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable , and rockbox turns this into an audiophile wonder , the sansa e250 could have a long life  .
i bought a second v  .
1 recently ; it also solved my adapter cord problem .
this is what mp3 players should all be like  .
i would not take another ipod for free after owning this one  .
i gave away 2 ipods and after trying 2 times to get what everyone else got suckered into  .
the other really good thing about this one is that it can be hacked with rockbox  .
this product , personally , has been the best mp3 product ive used  .
the sansa e250 is a great mp3 player loaded with features  .
at the time of this review , i have owned the sansa e250 for four weeks  .
i use it frequently and im a music guru ive had three mp3 players before this , a sansa m230 (512 mb) , an old mp4 player with 512 mb (it is a low quality no    name brand) , and my old cell phone which had a music player built    in (kyocera kx5)  .
i have not had the need until recently to get a player with more memory , and when i saw this mp3 player , for the price and memory i saw it as a great bargain for the price (i bought it refurbished for only $50) first off , a correction on most reviews   there are accessories for this player including speakers , car and home chargers , and even a pair of headphones that cradles the sansa (check out circuit city)  .
i also bought a home charger for under $2 (and $8 with shipping) that i use with no problems one of the features i wanted is expandable memory , and i already had microsd cards for my old kyocera music phone  .
nowadays , with technology advancing , you can buy microsd cards up to 6 gb , but the original firmware only allows up to 2gb i say original firmware because i found a great , stable firmware editor called rockbox  .
its compatible with the sansa and doesnt void your warranty  .
it adds a lot of other features to your mp3 player like advanced playlists , settings , and the capability for doom and other games  .
but im not here to review rockbox , so go check it out on your own at rockbox  .
org some people complain about the sub    par music playback  .
i find the music quality great even on a pair of cheap    o ear buds  .
extra bass settings sound distorted under louder volume settings , but otherwise the quality is very nice the external features of the mp3 player are nice , too  .
unlike many reviews , i rarely find the buttons surrounding the track wheel hard to press (but then again im a young teen with smaller fingers  .
) the track wheel , which lights a brilliant blue color , does click when you scroll it (in other words its not free spinning) , but its easy to spin it fast to scroll through large playlists one problem i have encountered is that i have managed to get my sansa horribly scratched across the screen and main body , but it has only been in my pocket along with ear buds wrapped around it and my cell phone (which has been getting scratched too & the two arent meant for each other  .
i cant determine if the sansa is easy to scratch or not to sum it up , its a good buy  .
if youre looking for more space , try one of the higher memory versions , like the 4gb or 8gb for $20 an increment  .
theres still that option of microsd cards too  .
overall , i love it  .
nice sound quality  .
easy to use  .
great playlists , menus , settings etc  .
rockbox compatible  .
microsd slot  .
there are accessories  .
small , light , sleek , and cool  .
easy to scratch  .
$20 is a lot for double memory , $40 for more  .
sometimes hard to hear under loud environments (noise    isolating ear buds fix that)  .
i picked up the e250r (includes rhapsody features) at best buy for christmas this past fall  .
i could not have been more satisfied  .
the jog wheel makes it extremely easy to navigate and it has all the features i could ever want in a mp3 player  .
the fm tuner is great for when you get bored with the tunes you load on it and it is handy always having a voice recorder with you when you need to remember something  .
videos and pictures look great  .
no complaints  .
love how sturdy it is , although i have a nice case for mine so that is not as big of a deal overall  .
great deal  .
so many features packed into a small unit by a great company  .
highly recommended  .
beats the heck out of a nano anyday  .
rockbox compatible  .
i bought this product from walmart on march 2nd and i had been really weary of buying an mp3 player , i used friends ipods and they are great as well  .
the thing that swayed me to the sansa e250 is the bright color screen , and that walmart had a big sign up saying that you cannot return an ipod no matter what , you can get it serviced or replaced but no returns  .
well i was not really sure about the purchase so i opted for the sansa , and i think this player is the best you can get for the price .
the sansa blows ipod and ipad nana right out of the water  .
shame is , few will notice .
more than a mp3 player this device is an integral media player  .
advance users will be pleased whit it , and novice users will find it very easy to operate and load music a lot of the problems explained here , and that are lowering the rating to the sansa , can be solved simply updating the firmware just go to sandisk webpage , click on downloads and you will find the sansa firmware updater  .
install it and follow the instructions to improve the fm reception can be use the usb cable as antenna it is very easy to use whit the last windows media player 11 it is curious that the media converter that came whit the device is different to the one showed in the help in the sandisk webpage  .
but works ok  .
the one that is showed in the page have more functions though if this player dont have a 9 is because of ignorant users that dont research to solve their issues and rush to post here a low rate although is not perfect i will give it a 10 because i think than the sansa deserve a better rating and one point more will help to rice it a little .
i have a nano that is still unopened because i figured something new and better would be coming out  .
i'm glad i waited the e250 is slightly larger than the nano but it's trivial  .
i like it because it has a built    in fm radio , voice recorder , ability to record off the fm radio , a really nice screen , long battery life , and a consumer replaceable battery  .
all these things are very important to me  .
i know what i don't have to just listen to music and when the battery stops recharging , i can replace it  .
i noticed that some people complained about the scroll wheel  .
like anything else , once you get use to it , no big deal  .
i have small hands but using only one hand to access all of the controls is very easy i looked at the samsung yp    z5 but it does not have the fm radio either oh lastly , the battery life is really great too i think that anyone who is contemplating getting a nano should really consider  .
i'm glad that i did  .
it is a great mp3 player , probably the best one i have ever had  .
mine is only 2gb one so i can only hold around 305 songs  .
like i said , if they can do something different with the design it will probably be the best mp3 player evar  .
they need to update this product asap  .
i definitely recommend this to everyone looking for an affordable mp3 player .
if you have a sansa try open source rockbox at rockbox  .
org  .
it if free , open source and it works better than the stock o/s  .
i can even play doom on my sansa  .
billy in sugar land  .
i had it for a little over a year  .
worked well , dropped many times , no damage , not even a scratch on it  .
dont count on it playing videos , i coultnt get a single one to sync on it , but maybe its just me good sound quality , the earphones are deecent in general , but after a few months , one stops working , and its like half sound  .
i blamed the mp3 , until i realized it is just the earphones after like 14 months , it still worked great , but would no longer sync songs right  .
like it would either acidently sync a song twice or just woulnt sync at all  .
it became malfunctional , but it mighta been from the excessive heat in florida and from the drops it endured i actually still have it now , even thoguh ive had two mp3 players since then , and whne the battery dies on my zune , i listen to my old songs on this  .
at first , i had some firmware problems with this player , and the screen would go randomly blank  .
but after the firmware upgrade i dled from sandisk , it worked perfectly  .
the new firmware also came with an equalizer you can set to your own preferences , which is a really important feature for me  .
there are some weird things in the menu , like you cannot save playlists , and there is no play all or a real repeat all option , even within artists , it only repeats the album if you select repeat all  .
but that's a minor problem , if you really want to you can make a go playlist i think its called , which is saved until you make a new one  .
sandisk has very good support , they answered my email right away when i had problems with my player and i got it fixed right away  .
the battery life is also awesome , and the fact that it is easily replaceable is also a plus .
the sansa e250 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 gb rapes the ipod's , creative's , samsung mp3's , and all other mp3 players i did not mention  .
this mp3 players come with music , photo , video , recording , and voice databases , and fm radio  .
oh , and increase its memory from 2 , 4 , 6 , or 8 gb to even more with the expandable memory feature , which means you can buy a microsd memory card , which adds memory to its existing memory  .
the only bad thing about this mp3 player , is that you need to convert pictures and videos , but thats not problem , the package comes with the media converter installation cd in it , along with the sansa mp3 player , the travel pouch , earphones , and a charger , but not an outlet charger  .
this charger you connect to your computer , and you can charge and transfer files all at once (computer must be on)  .
music    you can transfer music from limewire , or windows media player 10+ , say  .
mp3 files ,  .
wma files , or  .
wav files  .
voice recording    you can record sounds for about 4+ minutes  .
fm radio    signal is very strong , and you can tune in from any radio station in your area  .
video    with the 1  .
8 tft screen , videos are so big , but are still high quality in picture  .
photo    put any kind of photo in your mp3 ,  .
jpg ,  .
btp , whatever  .
the only actual problem with it is the charger situation with your computer , but overall its over 80 dollars cheaper than ipods at circuit city  .
i would highly recommend this device to anyone who is looking to buy mp3 players  .
enjoy  .
all in all , it is an wonderful product  .
it literally has everything , music , video , photos , radia , voice recorder , microphone , expandable memory slot , replacable battery , what more do you want  .
moreover , navigation is lot easier than ipods , the navigation wheel has a nice touch feeling  .
oh , you got music eq , you can build up your own to go list  .
it is much smart looking than ipods , and doesnt have compatibility issues like ipod has a few word of advice  .
try to sync it with windows media player 10 or higher , and never use the rhapsody  .
with rhapsody , you loose control of files and folder you have to download media converter from the cd that comes along with it  .
and if you want video to be uploaded , do it thru media converter if you are waiting to buy the right mp3 player for so long , the wait is over , buy it , you will love it .
its features are very good , and its worth the price  .
however , i think the sansa should be upgradeable through other types of memory , like the cheaper sd , instead of the expensive microsd .
before my sansa e250 , i had a 1gb apple ipod nano (1st generation ; no colour options)  .
it is great and all , but after about a few weeks , the battery started to wear out  .
weird , eh  .
i've heard other users had the same experience , so instead of opting to shell out another 200 or 300 bucks for the 2nd generation apple ipod nanos with colour options , i picked up a sandisk e250 and let me tell you , i is amazed  .
aside from playing mp3 files , the e250 also sports an fm tuner , voice recorder , and video and photo viewer first and foremost , i love music when i listen to music , i want it to be crystal clear with good bass reproduction  .
now since sandisk originally provided digital memory solutions at first , and now they've evolved to provide various other products , i is worried as to what the sound quality would be like  .
if any of you are like me in the regard of must having excellent sound , the e250 will not disappoint  .
it provides excellent sound across all spectrums , including highs , mids , and lows  .
a word of advice replace the included earbuds with a pair of griffin earthumps  .
the combination of the e250 and the earthumps was , in my opinion , quite a superb pair , and at many times tempted me to send my component stereo to the dump in other areas of the e250 , i liked the display and the bright backlit scroll wheel , but a word of caution   the backlit scroll wheel is very bright , especially in the dark ; i cannot count how many times i almost blinded myself when fumbling with the e250 in the dark  .
everything is legible on the screen , and the main menu sports some pretty cool graphics icons  .
unfortunately , you're pretty much stuck with the blue themed menus and background , and at times i wished sandisk had an option to modify those aspects of the e250  .
additionally , the menu setup and functionality could be better than it already is  .
a prime example   the e250 has a go playlist , for adding songs on    the    fly  .
in order to add songs , however , you have to go to the song , start to play it , and then access a menu to get to the option to add it to the go playlist  .
imagine doing that for every song you want to add to the go playlist   navigate to song , play , add to go playlist , go back to music menu , navigate to song , play , add to go playlist , etc removing a song from the go playlist involves the same process too aside from the too bright backlight , the scroll wheel managed to do its job , but at times did so slowly  .
this is probably due to the fact that it is mechanical instead of touch sensitve , and so slowed scrolling down a tad , but nothing too serious as mentioned before , the e250 also offers an fm tuner , voice recorder , and video and photo viewer  .
the fm tuner works fairly well , as does the voice recorder  .
however , the process of getting videos and photos onto the e250 is somewhat annoying  .
you have to use sandisk's conversion software to convert the videos and photos on your computer to some proprietary format before you can transfer them to the e250  .
i haven't tested it out myself , since i only use the e250 for music listening , but i'd imagine i'd get quite annoyed if i wanted to put photos and videos on the e250  .
thankfully , transferring music from your computer to the e250 involves nothing more than connecting the e250 to the computer with the included usb cable and dragging and dropping mp3 files  .
take note   no additional software (not even itunes) is needed ; windows xp recognizes the e250 as either a mass storage device or portable music device (the latter is used if you wish to use windows media player to transfer music) so you can just simplay drag and drop durability wise , the e250 should withstand the rigors of our daily lives  .
it weighs in more heavier than the nano , due to the liquid metal , scratch resistant case backing  .
put the e250 in the palm of your hand and a nano in the other , and you'll immediately notice the difference  .
the battery life of the e250 is quite good  .
i got an average of about a week , with the e250 playing about two hours a day  .
that approximation does not take into account the e250's long boot up time  .
i'm not sure why , but powering the unit on takes some time (between 10    15 seconds) before the main menu appears  .
it's normal though , because the sample models at various retailer stores i went to exhibited the same lengthy boot up overall , if you had it with apple's ipod nanos , switch on over to the sandisk e200 series  .
the e250 offers and does everything the ipod nano does , but with style and value .
i've had this for about 10 months , and it is a great mp3 player (for those of you who don't know better , the ipod is also an mp3 player ) i like the big screen , although if you want to do movies go with the zen vision   m or w  .
its nice for those short , but hilarious clips  .
i love the menu system , and the tactile scroll is the way to go (i hate touch sensitive ) syncs great with ms's home run wmp 11 , although if you want it to auto    sync , you need to get the e260+  .
(wmp needs at least a capacity of 4gb to autosync) the only thing that keeps it from a 10 is the front scratches way easily (back is darn near impossible to scratch though) and is a fingerprint magnet , but a clear poly carb case clears that up  .
some people will tell you that its too thick , but personally i think the nano is anorexic snap    in    half    if    you    look    at    it    wierd thin  .
i personally like a thick , heavy device (i wish it weighed 10 lbs) because it feels substansial and durable  .
the nano doesnt do that for me at all , i hate holding them anyways , this is a great mp3 player that is better than the ipod nano (both generations) in every way  .
well games do not come preinstalled , but dual booting rockbox gives you like 10 games , and one is a first person shooter  .
this mp3 player is the best choice , so go for it  .
i absolutely love my new sansa  .
this is a breakdown of what ive explore so far    .
downloading music    i is able to easily retrieved music from my hard drive on to its program rhapsody (equivalent to itunes)  .
my boyfriend who chose the ipod nano had a slightly harder time retrieving his music with itunes  .
note   it did not synch to my itunes library but i didnt care because i dont have much there anyway graphics    the graphics on sansa are beautiful  .
it almost reminds me of a high tech cellphone for lack of words  .
it has a blue background with bubbly icons  .
each song you play has a picture of the album/artist you are playing if its available  .
the pictures i saved to my sansa did not loose quality , they look amazing features    my favorite one is the expandable memory  .
2gb is definitely not enough memory for me although i thought it would more than sufficient  .
as it turns out i have over 1 , 000 songs in my computer and its hard to choose the ones i love the most  .
i feel like my investment is not a waste because i can buy more memory  .
sansa has an fm tuner  .
in addition to music , you can store pictures and voice and radio recordings  .
i recorded a great radio mix of a song i love with the radio recording feature  .
you can rate your entire library and then play music according to your ratings extra special feeling    it came with a bunch of songs  .
good songs  .
all new stuff and very good all stuff sorted by categories  .
you can find that under rhapsody channels i got my moneys worth  .
i highly recommend this product  .
dont be fooled by the price    this mp3 is right up there with the ipod  .
in my opinion it surpasses the ipod  .
i bought it when the mini first came out and truthfully i is not impressed by it  .
although i love the ipod design , the graphics are too plain for my taste  .
my ipod actually broke down after a few months and i didnt want to pay $50 to get it fixed  .
on top of that the ipod shuffle came out a month later and the ipod price went down and the memory went up  .
waste of my money .
ghet it insted of an ipod nano or get a zune  .
let me tell you something , this is the absolute best mp3 player i have ever spent money on  .
if you're looking for an ipod alternative , start considering this mp3 player    it may be a little thicker than the ipod nano , but personally i like the fact that it feels solid in my hands    the sansa e250 comes with a wide array of features , including video playback , picture viewing , album art , radio , voice recording/radio recording , and of course , mp3 playback    the sansa media converter is absolutely incredible , without a doubt  .
the drag and drop music feature , as with most music features , is simple and quick    video is actually surprisingly good considering screen size and what not  .
definitely a good surprise though    micro sd/transflash expansion slot is a life saver if you only want the 2 gig , but want to expand your memory of course , this mp3 player is not without it's faults , as is the ipod is not    picture quality is not great when you download pictures onto the player    downloading videos takes about six to nine minutes for 32 mb file , but that's understandable    there's a proprietary dock , which is a pain to deal with if you lose it    it is a fingerprint magnet , but so are many other mp3 players  .
it's also simple to fix    the record button on the side is a little annoying if you don't have the lock on the bottom line is this mp3 player is great out of the box , the software download is quick and easy , to put it simply , you get your money's worth , and then some  .
definitely consider this player as an ipod alternative for sure  .
i do not know why i had ever bought an ipod questions comments  .
sennyson03@aim  .

ryan  .
i bought this on circuit city , on a special i only saved 10 dollars , but it worth the money , it has trans flash/micro sd card expansion slot but the cards are expensive , i recommend this to you  .
generally impressed although as mentioned by others the thumb navigation selectors are too close to the rotor wheel  .
would have been so much better to either put them inside the wheel or combine the wheel with the selectors this seems to be a common design problem in hand held devices    my samsung phone has the same problem , they just do not allow enough space for people with nornal size thumbs  .
the headphones do actually fit inside your ears well because of the way they are constructed but the very thin wire used becomes a tangled mess too easily however all said and done very good value for money , i am happy with mine and would much rather have a couple of these than spend twice as much on the ipods et al if you think the storage capacity is an issue .
for the price you cant beat it .
the display and excellent sound quality are the pros  .
the earbuds are a real problem for me , keep slipping out  .
i don't consider this a big deal because i have loads of headsets and other earbuds around the house  .
they could have gone with the in the ear canal type  .
the download process , i use urge , is very simple and fast  .
i do wish it came with an ac adapter though  .
i bought a rubberized case and love it because the player wo not slip  .
i found the wheel is very easy to turn and buttons very easy to press , not like the reviews i have read on this aspect  .
all in all i think it is a great little player and i am very happy i bought it , much nicer screen than the ipods i have seen .
this one has it all with some tweaking and you must update the firmware  .
if you do not you'll be rating this a 3 or lower i love that this is a good compromise between the nano and video ipod without god aweful touchpad technology  .
one of the gripes i had were , the 10 minute breaking up of videos when you tried to convert a long video over to the sansa  .
i fixed this on the sandisk_e200_msc  .
apr file and changed the splittime  600 to something higher  .
but i realized why they did this  .
there's no fast    forward feature for the video  .
i forgot this is not a dvd player but hey , i figured out exactly how to manage what i want  .
scandisk please add this simple feature to you're next firmware update  .
please  .
i think there is also a tweak for the 2 hour radio record limit at a time but i really havent bothered looking because i havent had the need  .
but i'm sure its out there i really cannot think of much this thing can improve on um buttons maybe need to be more tactile  .
maybe some rubberization/foam on them please  .
and if the spin wheel were to be made of the same metal it had in the back , that would be awesome  .
backlight the buttons not the spinwheel  .
that's about it  .
i've looked at v ipods , nanos , creative's , and this seems to be as close to perfect that i can get almost side note    .
now if ms would simply put windows mobile on their zune then that i would buy instead windows mobile is already out there on phones  .
the entertainment industry cannot go after you when you already have something on the market that they havent said anything about  .
stupid stupid microsoft  .
i like this product alot  .
it does every thing i want an mp3 player to do and more  .
i would recomed it over the ipod  .
with the prices dropping i is able to get 2 of these units (with pricematching and coupons) for less than 70 each  .
i have been impressed with how long it lasts on a charge and the amount of community support ( http  //www  .
anythingbutipod  .
com/forum/forumdisplay  .
php  .
f  9 )for playlist software  .
the only drawback seems to be the video converter software  .
it is somewhat buggy , but just like the firmware updates for the player itself i am certain there will be an update to fix the converter  .
i have watched a couple of tv shows converted and listened to podcasts and songs during my morning workouts  .
for sound quality i cannot complain but i have some senheisers that i have had really good luck with and have used with my last 3 mp3 players  .
i have no complaints on the sound especially with the ability to eq it if needed  .
unlike the ipods it also has fm radio and the ability to expand with microsd cards  .
i just picked up a 1 gig for $14 on buy  .
i bought my wife the zen microphoto about 2 months ago and i bought the sansa e250 for my self about a week ago , as soon as i got it i started downloading misic and videos with no problem at all  .
i showed my wife a 9 min video and since then she has refuse to give me back the mp3 player so now iam stock with the zen wich i dont like much  .
i have had this player for about a month now and just love it  .
bought it to listen to books and music  .
i is amazed at how great video's look on it .
i must start off by saying that i got this product yesterday and is pleasantly suprised by it  .
i really wanted to find something better than the iconic ipod , and i've truly found it  .
in the search for my first mp3 player , i is considering three products   1) ipod nano 2g (2nd gen) ; 2) sandisk sansa e250 ; and the 3) iriver clix i investigated all three and here is what i found (and why i picked the sansa e250)  .
1) the ipod nano 2nd generation has made many improvements over its last nano  .
the sound quality is good , the touch wheel is nice , and its simplicity of use is noteworthy  .
although the price has come down (2gig for $140) , i believe that the ipod is seriously lacking in features for that price  .
no fm radio , no fm recorder (on the fly recording) , no voice recording , no video (it doesnt support wma files) 2) the sandisk sansa e250 is at the bottom of my list origninally  .
however the closer i looked at it the more and more it grew on me  .
it offers a ton of features for an amazing price ($110)  .
the features are what sold me over the ipod  .
some people's reviews say they have problems with the e250 locking up  .
however i have not had a single problem with this  .
i is actually told by the worker at the store that they have lots of complaints with the apple ipod locking up  .
the sansa's sound quality is amazing  .
i would even say it equals or exceeds the nano's  .
the supplied headphones are suprisingly good too what i really wanted is an fm tuner on my mp3 player , and this one even has fm recording  .
i get tired of the same old songs , so i want the ability to say hey , im tired of these songs , i just want to listen to the radio for a while  .
another awesome feature is the expandable memory with a microsd card , which i also use in my phone , so i can switch them back and forth with music the screen on the sansa e250 is amazing , big and bright  .
photos look awesome  .
the video feature really suprised me as to how good it was  .
the spin    wheel is a little bit below that of the ipod (it tends to feel grainy at first , a litle cheap , until you get used to it) but is fine after you get used to it  .
however the blue ring lights up and looks really sweet  .
some people complain of the buttons being too small , but i have large hands and i have no problem (it's no different from having a small cell phone like so many of us have these days) the player feels super sturdy in your hand  .
the back plate is a liquid alloy , so it is very strong and scratch resistant  .
it is nice and compact , and not much thicker than the overrated nano downloading music from windows media player is simple , just drag and drop  .
you have to charge the player with the usb cord , but that seems to be the new thing with mp3 players  .
and if you think about it , pretty much everywhere you go there is a computer , so just plug it in to any comp  .
3) the iriver clix is orignially at the top of my list , althought it is a little more pricey ($180    200)  .
the dock for it looked sweet , and supposedly it is a good brand  .
however what immediately put it at the bottom of my list after handling it is its design  .
i need to be able to use my player with one hand , since i use mine in the car alot (plugged into the stereo)  .
with the clix , you pretty much have to use two hands , one to stabilize it and one to push the buttons  .
the buttons are awkwardly small and placed on the sides of the player  .
you click on the screen itself to cycle through options , which make the screen one huge fingerprint smudge that is the one strong point of the clix  .
the screen is large (2  .
2 inches) and very nice  .
however the ergonomics of the player immediately turned me off to it so all in all   the sansa e250 won out  .
i highly recommend it for anyone interested  .
for the price , it is the best value  .
an amazing product , and yes , i will even go so far to say that it is an ipod killer in my book  .
all you pay for with the ipod is the little apple symbol and the fashion statement some think it entails  .
i say break away from that trend  .
get way more features for a better price my roomate just got an apple ipod nano 4gb (2nd gen) , and i got the sansa e250 at the same time  .
needless to say he is jealous  .
pros   price , features (fm tuner , pictures , video , recording) , screen , easy to sync music with wmp cons   click wheel feels a little grainy at first , some may say cheap , but you get used to it very quickly  .
buy this player  .
trust me and save your money  .
it is better and cheaper than the nano plus you can add memory .
this is a smart mp3 player  .
small and stylish  .
great sound quality with good fm radio  .
voice recorder and fm recorder  .
so many functions i do not know why there are many people who wants to pay more for an ipod this device is awesome  .
great choice for someone looking for an alternative mp3 player  .
user replaceble battery  .
you can add more memmory with micro sd flash memmory  .
this is almost perfect  .
excellent  .
after dealing with rca/thomson for the last ten (10) months and their terrible rd2765a player i is pointed in the direction of the sandisk and have to say i wish i had purchased this unit way back in december 2005 instead of the rca piece of crap  .
great sound , sleek design , easy to operate and read , large capacity , rivals the apple , in my opinion .
why spend the money on an ipod when you can buy one of these for less $$$  .
the earphones are a little cheap , but you can find replacements everywhere  .

this player is much better than the ipod nano  .
many more features , better durability , an all    around winner  .
i had a 20gb ipod 5th generation and it died after about 15 months  .
i didnt think the ipod video is worth the money considering the short battery life and small screen  .
with the sansa , i can watch video clips , get photos , music , record , fm (awesome) all within my budget  .
i dont think i'll ever buy an ipod again .
i have owned my sandisk sansa e250 2gb mp3 player for about 3 weeks now  .
i am completely satisfied with it  .
it plays mp3's flawlessly , has a radio tuner (which can record broadcasts) , has a digital voice recorder that works great , and on top of all that plays video (mpeg) clips seamlessly on the color screen  .
this unit also has a great interface , expandable memory , a consumer removable battery , and a scroll wheel  .
oh , and did i mention that it costs $80 less than the comparable ipod nano (2gb)  .
if your in the market for small , light , great looking mp3 player and can get by without itunes (this unit uses windows media player) , i would highly recommend this product  .
let the someone else keep up with the jones while keeping apple in business  .
save yourself the money and get a lot more .
1st mp3 and very happy w/ performance .
i think personally it rocks but some peeps dont but they are retarded  .
i is torn between the ipod nano and the e250  .
i only need about 1gb of storage , but for the price opted for the 2gb player from sandisk  .
i have no prior experience with sandisk's products other than sd cards  .
this is a great first experience  .
the fact that it has an inexpensive replaceable battery just solidifies it's status above any ipod out there  .
i mainly use mine to play mp3s  .
i find my sansa e250 easy to use  .
what prompt me to buy it is the reviews over battery life , performance , durability , and price  .
the battery lasts a long time  .
i can play it for a good 10 hours before i have to charge it  .
the down side about charging it is that you have to use the usb cable  .
i normally charge it at night when i get home from work  .
i can see how it would make sense if you were always updating your playlist on your sansa , but it is a bit inconvienant  .
sandisk should look into making a plug in charger i find that my sansa functions great  .
i have heard others complain that there is a noise that you can hear in between songs  .
it sounds like a cd player trying to decide on a song  .
i haven't heard anything like that from mine  .
start up time is fairly fast  .
it takes about 30 seconds  .
i like the scroll circle  .
it's very handy when scrolling through songs or the menu  .
the other buttons around the scroll is a little hard to touch , but not that hard  .
i can see it being a problem if you have chubby fingers  .
it's very durable  .
it's fairly scratch resistant as well  .
i've dropped mine a few times and it doesn't have any scratches on it the price for what it does is great  .
i bought mine from best buy for $139  .
99 i love my sansa and it does great for what i want it to do  .
there are some features that i can see that needs to improve one mainly being the record button  .
it's very easy to hit the record button  .
the headphones are a bit uncomfortable , but i have small ears so i found the ear pieces a bit too big for mine  .
but it's easy to buy another pair i haven't messed with sansa media converter to convert videos as i have no need for it  .
i get clear reception on the radio  .
i have not really played with the recorder either all in all i'm a satisfied customer  .
it is a nice alternative to ipod  .
this is my first mp3 and i wanted something basic to play some lectures i listen to  .
the price and features beat out other players in consideration  .
size is just right and ease of use is impressive i had some initial issues trying to use video podcast files through itunes  .
but got used to the convertor tool provided for video and pictures audio quality is overall good , but amplifier is poor which in a way is good for your ears  .
i used a software tool to amplify the audio on my mp3's .
great sound quality , holds plenty music , and it's tiny  .
everything i wanted in an mp3 player  .
i just picked up a brand new 2    gig model for the excellent price of $145  .
thing is ready to go right out of the box  .
turned it on and listened to some of the sample music included , excellent sound calrity and frequency response  .
i loaded some photos and video on to it  .
superb screen color , clarity , and brightness , so skipping or jumping  .
all in all the best buy i've made in a good while .
this is my second mp3 player and is all you could want  .
what i love best about this player is the ability to download your own music without having to buy it , unless you want too  .
also you can view full length movies or clips from dvd concerts using dvd conversion software , (converts to wmv files)that play on sansa  .
ear buds are better than most  .
download the firmware update from sandisk , it is easy to install  .
improves connections and downloads  .
fm works well and you can record off of it also  .
one product that i feel like i got more than my money's worth .
works great with media player 11 and urge  .
feels sturdy and i've had it for 2 weeks with no scratches yet  .
mechanical scroll wheel is easy to use and precise  .
fm and built in mic recordings are amazingly good one thing that sucks is that when you plug in the unit into usb port (the only way to charge it unless you buy accessory charger) the unit does not allow for playback  .
so you can only sync files while charging via usb but no playback  .
a minor annoyance unit gets plenty loud and stock earbuds are decent video playback works well and in landscape  .
converting videos and syncing is easy but takes a while to convert i found that i accidentally hit the rec button on the side way too much  .
button should be harder to press to avoid accidentally pushing it buttons are too small for my hands  .
but i got used to it in like 10 minutes battery is removable but you must remove 4 small screws in the back .
i bought this cus i like using things not many other people are using (relative to the ipod for example)  .
i also saw that it is cheaper than the ipod and then 2 months later , it got even cheaper  .
using the player is very easy and fm tuner is a plus the only problems were the software and initial loading of this player onto the pc  .
i didnt know that u had to go to sandisk  .
com and get the latest firmware download for it to be detected on my pc  .
(it took me hours to find this out  .
) then the rhapsody software is confusing when i first tried using it , so i just copy and pasted songs into the memory drive it is found in  .
i also wish you could delete songs without using the pc (on player alone) .
i walked into best buy specifically wanting to purchase the ipod nano  .
but as soon as i read the description for sandisk sansa e250 (2gb) i is hooked and purchases it  .
this mp3 player has much more features for the same price  .
my only complaint is that the battery does not last for the 8 hours more like 5 hours but still what a great buy and deal  .
this thing is great  .
it looks bigger than u exepct its actually really small i think the scroll wheel is amazing especially when u turn it it lights up it plays videos , photos , fm radio , voice recording , many songs and has many other features its actually almost perfect but whats bad about it is the small buttons surrounding it but still its not a big problem i had a nano and trust me this thing is much better and u save money too  .
before this mp3 player i had a mpio fl    100 and before that i had a diamond rio 32mb  .
the previous two i had went through batteries like no other  .
so i looked for something inexpensive that played mp3s and had a rechargeable battery  .
i found this i think its perfect  .
i don't want to watch videos or show off pictures i just want to listen to music when i study and run  .
this definitely gets the job done  .
i did have one issue  .
i corrupted the files on the drive some how and the player would continuously reboot and i could not use it at all  .
so i called sandisk tech support (18667263475) and they walked me through going into recovery mode and reflashing it and its worked perfect ever since (about 10 minutes now)  .
this is my first mp3 player and i couldn't ask for a better product for the money that i put in  .
at $50 less than the ipod nano equivilant , it has video , fm tuner , recorder (voice and radio) , photo viewer , and the normal music playing that you get with any mp3  .
it even has album art when syncronized with window's media player  .
the menu's and controls are very user friendly  .
people complain about the turnwheel , but i prefer it over the ipod touch wheel anyways  .
to sum it up  .
i could not be happier .
apple should give the advertising firm that markets their ipods a big raise  .
they have managed to create an empire with a below average product that has an idiot software package (itunes) that tries to control you as well  .
i heard the word is getting out there that ipods are not that good , i thought i is the only one that is not happy anyone want to buy a nano  .
cheap  .
i've had this player for about 2 weeks now , and have been very pleased with it  .
i is pleasantly surprise at how crisp the display is and how good movies play on the device (although , i do not see using this feature much) the interface is very intuitive and well organized  .
the volume is not as loud as the ipods but it's plenty for me , and i substituted shure e2cs for the ear    phones that come with it ; and it sounds great .
this player is great  .
i hesitated in buying it initially because it did not have a customizable eq or bass boost but i can tell you after using it that it is not a big draw back  .
the preset eq's are more than enough , and there's no need for bass boost  .
great sound  .
although i usually use my sennheiser px    100 , the included earbuds are better than average one of my biggest requirements is good fm reception for listening to public radio while at work  .
i've been through many players looking for that    phillips 6 gb (horrible fm) , creative 6gb and 8gb (awesome , but even worse fm reception) , iriver t10 (great reception , awkward shape)  .
the sandisk has incredible fm reception the size and shape are perfect  .
the user replaceable battery is also a good feature  .
another thing i like is that it shows up when i click on my computer so i can just drag and drop files onto it without worrying about windows media issues  .
i also listen to a lot of podcasts , and have found that i can use itunes for that , just go to the location on the hard drive and copy and paste into the player this is a wonderful unit  .
just a heads up for anyone  .
i've had mine afew days and it's worked great  .
i went to add new music to it and after that it would only read one song  .
so i reconected the cable and is going to reformat it and saw there is no way to i pocked around my computer and the unit has to be plugged in in the msc format , and then you can right click on it in my computer and format it  .
takes it straight back to how it is right out the box  .
this is my first mp3 player , and all i can say is wow  .
a very well made and reliable player , worthy of being the ipod nano rival , if not more  .
when i first came to this site , the nano is the only thing i is looking for  .
but seeing so many choices , i decided to outline my own requirement to narrow down the field  .
what i wanted is an affordable mp3 player that could play not only music , but books    on    disc and language discs as well , is versitile , reliable , user friendly and well constructed  .
i narrowed down the field to this and the nano ; nano not being nearly as versitile , but had more aftermarket accessories to go with it  .
but , checking the local bestbuy , i found the sansa cheaper despite being newer and having more features  .
so far , i've tested all the features and have had no problems  .
i agree with one user complaint about no stop button function , but this is trival compared to what the whole package offers  .
it weighs more than nano , but it is a soild weight , as if it is one soild peice  .
a user replacable battery is another thing it had over nano  .
and with all the complaint about ipod batteries , including the employee at bestbuy who said they had to return their nano four time because of it , made the sansa much more attractive  .
mind you , i'm not anti    ipod , it just was not up to my requirements  .
the only problem is the wait  .
i got mine on sale for $150 and had to go to two stores before i found one in stock  .
almost a week  .
but i got it and it's great thank you c/net and users for all your info .
i've had this player for a few short days and i'm already hooked  .
at $150 , this player is a real steal  .
the buttons can be a little difficult to press due to the raised wheel , but overall the interface is well designed  .
the black case looks slick , but shows fingerprints very easily  .
externally accessible microsd slot is a great feature audio quality is excellent , and eq settings are a nice bonus  .
the graphic level meter is a fun addition as well it is an excellent player but with a little ingenuity and creativity , you can work around its limitations playlist capabilities are very limited so i have resorted to using the windows utility mp3tag to modify genre id3 tag settings to create a playlist then on the e250 , i simply play the genre playlist the screen is bright and large for a device of this size sandisk does not offer an ac adapter  .
it can only be charged via the usb cable attached to a pc  .
this is a concern for me since i planned on taking this player on a weeklong trip where i would not have access to a pc  .
in a moment of inspiration , i purchased the smallest , cheapest powered usb hub i could find  .
lo and behold , it is able to charge the e250  .
voila  .
ac adapter  .
(that is also capable of charging my other mobile devices too)  .
the e250 does not have a sleep timer my sansa m230 (my previous player) did and found it very handy video playback on the e230 is surprisingly good  .
however the supplied encoding software (written by arcsoft) creates mammoth sized video files  .
it weighs in at 12mb for each minute of video  .
the videos i encode for my smartphone are only 1mb/minute and they look superb i did manage to use a hex editor and tweak the profile of the encoding software to reduce the bitrate so that video files are only 6mb/minute  .
not ideal , but 1/2 the size of video encodes out    of    the    box in my opinion , sandisk players are underrated  .
they're not perfect , and do not have the cachet that the ipod name has , but they're solid performing players that offer a lot of value for the money  .
any negative reviews that describe lock    ups and freezes are probably due to players with older firmware the latest version (12a at the moment) is rock solid stable i recommend this player to anyone who wants an ipod nano    like device but supports video playback (out    of    the    box) at a decent price .
this mp3 player is jam packed  .
basically this will be the ipod killer  .
i is just about ready to buy one and i saw this on best buy and i could not resist  .
it is perfect  .
i especially love the wheel in the middle  .
i love everything about this  .
i recommended it to my friend , he bought it the same day  .
we are both sandisk supporters  .
get this mp3 player  .
you wont be dissapointed  .
does anyone know how to create multiple playlists , other than the 'go list'  .
this is a great buy for music and gadget lover packs much more features than ipod nano , such as fm radio , voice recorder and much more it gives other mp3 players a run for the money overall excellent buy .
i think this mp3 player rocks  .
you get the feature of the ipod and some  .
i think the greatest advantage this player has is windows media playforsure compatability  .
while it's great pay  .
99 for a song with the ability to burn it up to 5 times , i like paying 10  .
00 a month to yahoo to access to any song that i want and transfer it to my mp3 player  .
who needs cds anymore anyways  .
i would recommend the silicone case to keep this baby nice and safe , and also screen protectors  .
( i may be anal , but i like to protect my investments) also , bestbuy has it on sale this week for 150  .
after a price match to staples i got it for 145  .
00 and 15  .
00 for the case  .
you cannot beat it .
this nano rival keeps it small , simple and to the point  .
talk about palm    sized  .
the size of my sansa e250 reminds of a zippo lighter on steroids , which has been flattened out and elongated , and sporting a neat liquid metal (fingerprint free) casing  .
this is a cool toy for ; students , running around town days , wasting away the precious minutes/hours in the long public service lines , and great for life in general the sansa e200 series is a good choice for those anti    nano/ipod people who are sick and tired of all the hype my only gripes ; limited accessories , for the money i spent on the e250 (bestbuy in    store price $189  .
99+tax) , should've paid a little more for the 4gb or 6gb versions .
i have had my e250 for about a week  .
i love it  .
it feels very solid  .
the closest competitor is the nano but i think it beats it going away  .
the sansa is cheaper , feels more sturdy , has an fm tuner , plays video , has a larger screen the only drawback i have found is that you cannot delete songs or videos without being connected to the computer  .
hopefully sandisk will fix this in the next firmware update .
i purchased the sandisk e250 at best buy for $169  .
it is one of the best players i have used build quality  .
the device is nicely built  .
it doesn't feel flimsy or breakable  .
it actually feels very solid  .
however , the center button is a little loose , but it doesn't feel like it is going to come off navagation  .
the device is pretty easy to navagate  .
i would however prefer a text only interface , but this is not that hard to move around  .
i found when i wanted to move to the choice on top , i would move down instead of up because of the wheel shape menu  .
navagating through a list of songs is very easy to do with the scroll wheel and you can easily narrow in a choice without a problem battery life  .
i haven't run any formal battery tests , but i have used this for about 4 hours of music with about an 1 hour of video without even a dent in the battery meter video and photos  .
in order to put either videos or photos on the device you have to use sandisk media converter which is not bad , but it would be easier to drag and drop  .
the video playback is very nice for the device's size  .
the video is small , but it is smooth and crisp  .
if you were to take photos from you digital camera and transfered them (via media converter) the picture looks small and you cannot see any detail in it  .
i would not recomend to use this device to show photos fm radio  .
it is simply ok  .
at some angles i found the reception to be staticy , but overall it sounded good scratches  .
after some basic pocket use , i found some minor scratches on the screen and body , but nothing that you can notice without looking at it from an angle or with the screen on wow factor  .
whenever i show my friends the first thing they ask is if it is a nano  .
oh course they are slightly disappointed at first , but as soon as i tell them of all the features and show them a music video they all say it is awesome  .
one of my friends is going to get a nano , but instead decided to get this .
this item is on sale at bestbuy this week       $20 off .
this thing is great  .
it serves the basic purpose of music holder and even has an expandable slot for more memory  .
the sound is nice too  .
the graphical interface is amazing and very crisp  .
i is not too worried about needing to view pictures or not , so that is not a priority for me  .
now that i have that feature , i am sure i will use it the only real bummer is that there are no after market armbands or cases  .
the sleeve that it comes with is nice , but not something to take to the gym  .
it also comes with a lanyard  not something i usually use the device is powered solely by usb  .
at first i thought that would be negative , then i realized that i can just plug it into any computer  not a problem after all also , having owned an iriver previously , i love the fact that there is no software for transferring music  .
its all drag and drop , like a regular file great product  .
like the guy before me , i got my sansa at bestbuy and i love it  .
i like the software interface and how easy and intuitive it is to use  .
you can set it to show up as a music device and sync it with windows media player or set it as a mass storage device and it shows up as a drive letter that you can just drag and drop to i got a nano a couple of weeks ago and i hated it  .
i didn't like the software interface  .
i didn't like having to use it with itunes  .
i didn't like it's lack of features for the price premium  .
no user replaceable battery  .
i just didn't like much about it at all so it went back and i got the sansa  .
it's like the difference between night and day  .
i just don't get all the hype over the ipod's  .
there is just too many other better choices out there  .
i guess the ipod is for people who have more money than brains  .
the bling crowd , or should i say herd i am very happy with my sansa , and like just about everything about it  .
i did not even have to use the owners manual to figure it out  .
it's just that easy  .
like i said , the only thing that irritated me is after i upgraded to the latest firmware it puts a cap on the size of the movie the sansa will play  .
i am sure they will fix that in the next firmware release though  .
this is a brand new product and i am sure they are still ironing out a few bugs i would highly recommend this player to everyone rob  .
this thing is pretty tight  .
i got mine just last thursday (april 6 , 2006) right out of the box you notice how nicely it fits into the palms of your hands the pro's  .
video    i only got 1 family guy episode on it , buh it loads fast maybe like 10 seconds and plays through  .
radio    kind of fuzzy in some areas buh for the most part clear  .
recording    able to record off the radio or voice record  .
20 hour playback    outstanding battery life  .
expandable memory    havent got a memoryu card ofr this yet , buh im sure i can boost up the song max  .
the con's  .
froze    min froze once already when trying to play a song  .
im still wondering about the freezing , buh i think the cause for it is because of a corrupted song loaded reason being is that it is the first time i played it and it froze  .
to make it unfroze i hada wait 20 hours for the batter to die then recharged it  .
buttons    the buttons surrounding the spin wheel are hard to press at times  .
my fingers are a little it smaller then normal size so that maybe a reson for it overall i really like this player and i applaud sandisk for making this as great as it is .
i just picked up the e250 2 gig model  .
i love it  .
walked into best buy to look at other players to my surprise they had 1 instock  .
bought it , downloaded some music and wow  .
no stalling as reported by others  .
working perfectly  .
only weak feature is the equilizer , it just seems to muffel the entire sound range  .
normal setting is perfect  .
screen is beautiful , video smooth  .
i downloaded pics and they were beautiful  .
so far a sandisk victory  .
no ipods for me  .
let the sheep/jones buy the ipods  .
get the sandisk .
a great product , for an extremely cheap price  .
frugal people will definitly enjoy something to this extent  .
although it's not next gen like the ipod touch or the zune hd (unreleased) and does not have a touch screen , it's size and flat    out features make this a worthwhile product .
getting it from the manufacturer pretty much ensures it will break  .
pay the extra money and get the refurbished one  .
they are /very/ heavy duty  .
mine from the manufacturer lasted 1 month , and everyone i know who's gotten the refurbished kind has gotten their money's worth  .
very good mp3 player  .
good quality  .
good head phones  .
radio is a plus , as is the recording things from the radio  .
i would recommend .
i love this device with rockbox  .
i prefer flac over mp3 and this fills my needs .
i love my sansa e250  .
mine has been tough and reliable with the right care , you wo not get scratches on it  .
mine still looks like new after almost a year of every day use  .
though , i do wish it is smaller , it's fine the way it is it is easy to use and navigate  .
the only problem i have is accidentally pushing the record button too often  .
luckily , i can avoid that by locking the mp3 player if i have to  .
a bonus to the recording , you can record from the radio , which is pretty cool overall , i am happy with my sansa e250 .
i got this player after my rio carbon bit the dust  .
i realized i really needed a flash player (for all that i loved my carbon) because i'm a student and take my player everywhere and just throw it in my backpack  .
i'm really hard on my mp3 players  .
this one stands up though  .
after 2 years , everything works well , and the screen is only a little scratched what i love   the sound quality is great , although you've really got to keep it in the standard eq , all the eq has is preset options which really just muffle it a bit  .
i wish that the player would get a bit louder , for when i'm walking around the city and everything is loud , but for everyday , it's great  .
the battery life really is awesome , i took it with me on a two week trip to turkey and greece , and even through 9 hour plane rides , plenty of car trips and sitting out in the sun , it still did not die until i reached home again i also love that it has an excellent fm radio , the channels all come in quite clearly  .
and something they need to add in ipods is a reverse scroll from the top of the songs list , which this player does my greatest gripe is just that the player takes a while to start up , and will occasionally freeze on you , which is a bummer , but it can usually be restarted  .
i would recommend this player for anyone  .
it's small , smart and cheap  .
its great player  .
i wanted with fm radio  .
fm radio and sound quality is very good you have to install software to get on your videos there  .
it can only play  .
mov video type files , which is annoying  .
you can only put videos with the help of this installed software  .
no direct copying time to time it crashes , especially when changing videos fast  .
there might be memory problem with it  .
overall one step forward to any mobile player .
i've had mine for 6 months now with almost no problems , had a little trouble when i first got it to keep it on , but i'm pretty sure it is my mistake of not letting it charge fully one of the reasons to buy the nano that i hear most is the lack of accessories for other mp3 players , but sandisk has started a made for sansa line of products with many of the same companies that make ipod accessories personally , i like the nice bulky feeling of it , the nano is thinner and lighter , but the nano feels like it could break if i bent it too hard , the e250 feels more solid the buttons around the scroll wheel can get hard to press , and i sometimes move the wheel while trying to press the button , but i do not find myself using those buttons that much also the price is a lot less (well at least for me) i got mine for $100 , whereas my brother got his 2gb nano for $200  .
this is a great little mp3 and the price is right  .
it's easy to download whatever you want from the rhapsody subscription , which is onlh $14  .
95 you do not have to worry about insecure downloads  .
it remembers the songs you like , allows you to rate songs so you can play favorites as well as playlists , by genre , or by artist or album  .
it also has tons of storage , more than i can get tired of at one time , and you can change your playlists and they will update automatically as soon as you connect it to the internet  .
it's great for first timers to the mp3 or experts .
i bought this for my girlfriend but took it for some test runs on my own first  .
when i bought it the first thing i did is update the firmware and format the stuff that sansa so nicely put on there for me  .
i plugged it in and opened wmp10 and off i went  .
easy load of music  .
still working on getting album covers to show up  .
radio works well  .
picture load is easy after setup and the image quality is very nice  .
have not done any video yet but i will get to that eventually  .
lots of good features and sound quality is good as well depending on the files you load  .
the headphones were uncomfortable and crappy  .
bought a new set  .
much nicer  .
this product overall is great  .
what flaws it does have are overshadowed by all the features  .
the main reason i wanted to write this review is to warn anyone buying this and other products with it to help protect it cosmetically  .
i had purchased the unit from cc and also the sandisk silicon case and fellowes writeright universal screen protectors  .
the silicon case works great , but the screen protector did the complete oposite of what it is intended to do  .
i had decided to go with a hard plastic case and when i is removing the screen cover , the adhesive ate away at a section of the faceplate  .
thankfully the majority of it is just below the viewable lcd , but a section is over the lcd leaving a noticeable blemish when the unit is powered on and off  .
aside from that , this unit is perfect .
this device is an excelent ipod nano alternative  .
the most atractive thing to me is the expandable memory (the only problem with this is that the microsd card isexpensive 29  .
99 for 512mb) the screen is nice and big which allows for watching video short clips (do not try to play full length video it eats up your battery life)the interface is very similar to the nano's however i find the sansa's to be a little friendlier , more astectically pleasing  .
there is no ac adapter , wihch is a problem for me because i'm out a lot and i'd like to be able to charge withought a computer  .
the device is very pretty but is a little bit off a finger magnet  .
i love my sansa and i'd say the only trully annoying thing about it is the the price of the microsd  .
ive only had this mp3 for about 2 months and its fairly good great design , love the screen but its too bad you cant change the background (consistly blue) and put your own pictures  .
love the buttons , reminds us of the ipod , pretty slim and compact the mp3 comes with a cd you can install on your computer which has a user guide but it doesnt work  .
so there are many features on this mp3 that i dont how to use because the user guide doesnt work  .
that is pretty frustrating its pretty solid , ive dropped it a few times and it didnt break nor had any problems with the controls its sad that we dont have a recently added playlist , so when we've added some new songs , we have to look through the whole list of songs which can be annoying when you have nearly 2000 songs after pressing power , we have to wait for about 15 seconds for the mp3 to load , and im a pretty impatient person you can add songs to a go list but you cant create a new list  .
or atleast i dont know how since the user guide is screwed up  .
now , the go list is slow , the songs are not in alphabetical order but in order in which u added them , which is annoying because it is long to look for a song in a 200 songs list in which they are not placed in alphabetical order now , the videos and picture options are great , the quality of diplay is amazing , but a cool feature they could add is creating a slideshow for a song  .
im very disappointed that you cant put one of ur own picture as a background the install cd has a program named sansa media converter where u easily slide pictures and videos so they can convert them into ur mp3 , but i had problems with this software not working very well , had trouble converting videos , and ended up not being able to convert any video for some unknown reasons .
i've been having an issue lately of tracks all of a sudden becoming bad  .
i'm not sure why this is happening , one day they work and the next they do not  .
anyone else had this problem with the e250 series  .
i have to say i like this better than either of my two creatives or the ipods i've tried  .
its pretty intuitive , and i wanted a flash type player for the gym , but i will be buying the bigger capacity one  .
my two issues with it are its weak eqs ; there's not much change , nor is the bass as good as i is hoping the other , slightly more serious issue is with the headphones  .
sound in one side or the other will just stop , mostly at the start of a new song for no reason  .
if i skip the song and go back it will work , but its a bit annoying , and the big reason why i no longer buy creatives  .
without the headphone trouble (i have used several different pairs , and keep experiencing this) i'd have given it a higher rating .
hey i just got this mp3 today and it is pretty awesome  .
first the software that it comes with is really hard to use , then i got use to it  .
and it has these awesome preset channels  .
it goes thru alot of songs , u can pick hip hop urban , rock and watever else u want  .
if u plannin to get this  .
its awesome get it  .
i bought this as a second time user , and i thought there is just too much going on 1) i didn't like the fact that i could not listen to it at low levels , because the lowest level is still very loud 2) the buttons around the rotating wheel are hard to press 3) if you buy the rhapsody one , i think it is a hassle because i could not transfer my music to the hard drive but , this is a good mp3 player  .
i would definetly say it is much better than an ipod .
what will happen if i have windows 2000 or (maybe later) windows vista  .
will something not work  .
this is my second one actually  .
the first one i broke 4 days after buying it , the screen cracked in my pocket , i called sandisk to find they do not offer a repair service  .
with the new one i got i noticed whenever i would stop a voice recording the player would freeze on me  .
i have to remove the battery to get the player working again  .
its probably a simple fix or update , i have yet to look in to it  .
over all it is a good player for its buck  .
i paid the same amount as an ipod nano only this one plays movies , has a recorder and a fm tuner , plus a replaceable battery  .
just be careful , big screens are easily broken and cannot be fixed .
i is originally undecided between the zen v plus and the sansa , and is unwilling to commit to the sansa because of problems with the scroll wheel and software that i'd heard of  .
i decided to try it when my retailer guarenteed that i could return it if i didn't like it , and i'm glad i tried it the features are amazing  .
from movies and pictures to fm radio and recording (both voice and the radio) , there's almost nothing this player cannot do  .
the look and feel are amazing too ; at first it is hard to put down  .
it's also small ; the ipod nano is far longer , and therefore harder to fit in your pocket the only downside is that sandisk has no dedicated software for the sansa ; you must use 3rd party software (such as rhapsody or windows media player)  .
at first i is unable to work either reliably , but eventually figured it out , and now they both work seemlessly i do not know much about the zen v plus , but i do know that the sansa e260 has everything the v plus does on a bigger screen , more easily navigable interface , and for a cheaper price whatever you decide to get though , stay away from ipods ; there are far better and far cheaper players on the market .
i looked at the ipod nano for a long time , but instead of purchasing one , opted for the sandisk sansa e250 , which , for $100 less , gives me all i want in an mp3 player overall score  .
my rating      10  .
cnet standards      8  .
the good  .
i personally like the storage i get from the e250 , as i moved up from a small , simple , hard    to    navigate 512mb player , to this 2 gig wonder i now own  .
i find it really easy to navigate the e250 , since it gives you multiple ways to sort your music , from artist , album , etc  .
also , i like the layout of the menus , such as the main menu , with icons situated in a circle patern , which you turn by turning the thumbwheel the bad  .
the thumbweel on my particular model sticks (a little) sometimes , this is not something that i cannot override by simply turning it with a little more force , it's just something i'd like to report  .
i'd also like to point out the hassle of deleting media (other than music) from the sansa  .
i am yet to find a way to delete pictures from my e250 , as their instructions on deleting media apparently don't apply to pics  .
the fm radio also does not recieve a signal without the usb cord attached to the bottom (as if you were charging or syncranizing your e250 , just without a compuer on the usb end) and let's face it , who is going to walk/ride around with a usb cord hanging off their mp3 player  .
i also often find myself fixing the mistake of accidentally pressing the voice record button on the side of the player , which completely stops my music , etc the wraps  .
+storage capacity  .
+menu layout  .
+menu options  .

position of the 'record' button  .
the bottom line  .
i like the sansa e250 and in my opinion the good outweighs the bad  .
and when i bought mine for about $103  .
00 on amazon , it really beats the nano (on price , i've never owned an ipod to compare functions , etc  .
just picked up one of these little gems a couple weeks ago , and am very satisfied so far the unit is very sleek sexy , with its cool illuminated blue thumbwheel , and smooth edges  .
it's a tad larger than the nano , but fits my hand comfortably  .
while the backside of the unit is of metal and quite solid , the front panel is made of rather flimsy plastic , and the glossy black finish will hang on to smudges and scratches very easily (suggest getting a protective case to keep it looking new) the screen is bright and colourful , and i appreciate the larger than average screen size    no squiting required  .
the menu system is intuitive , and i found it easy to navigate  .
easy to scroll through song , genre , album or artist lists  .
fm radio works well , the voice recorder is average but will get the job done for most situations  .
imported pictures and video (which takes loads of space) are displayed as well as you'll get for such a small (1  .
8 ) screen , but they first need to be converted using the sansa software sound quality is very good , despite a short burst of digital system noise that is heard between tracks (or when scrolling)  .
as with all mp3 players , do yourself a favor and pick up a decent set of buds or phones for a better listening experience  .
as for the limited amount of equalizer settings that were first reported    the new firmware i just installed gives you more settings , plus a much desired custom eq setting the thumbwheel is not smooth rolling like the ipod , it's more of a tactile wheel    but it is accurate when scrolling up or down  .
the only true downside for me are the control buttons  .
i find them too small , and so close to the thumbwheel's raised edge  .
it takes some getting used to , and may prove difficult for those with large thumbs battery life is quite good    i've churned out over 11 hours on 1 charge , and still have juice to spare  .
expansion slot (microsd) is a nice plus for down the line , as is the user replacable battery all in all , for the price and features of the e200 series , and despite its few quirks , i do not think many could go wrong , and i'd recommend it to others .
does the e200 series of sandisk mp3 players work with win2k  .
it's only listed to work with winxp which i do not have and i would like to get one only if it works with my os .
i is looking for a nano type player that used flash memory , did not require returning unit to manufacturer to replace battery and allowed me to load music without using proprietary software (although sandisk software is req'd for loading video/photos)  .
the sansa e200 series is a perfect fit for me  .
i'm very satisfied with the e250 and would not hesitate to recommend it .
i got this product for my birthday , after suggesting it to my friend's parents , who wanted to go with an ipod nano  .
i know that ipod pretty much has the mp3 world by the well , you get me  .
i saw the sansa e200 series and fell in love  .
it's small design is great not as bulky as the ipod video , but not as ridiculously small as the ipod nano , with the best features of both built in  .
i personally never liked any ipods except for the mini series , and have heard bad reviews on the nano's metal backing  .
the sansa has liquidmetal backing , that is pretty much scrath resistant  .
it has a nice sized screen , a more interactive menu (with bright icons and background colors) , a microsd slot for updgrading memory , and it has an fm tuner  .
i cannot think of any better reasons to buy it  .
i think sandisk should try and build upon this series , and become a strong competitor with ipod for the top spot in the mp3 world  .
ps the 2gb version seems small (in memory size) , but i managed to fit 750 songs (250 more than is said to be able to fit on) and the sony e3 conference video , that is 1 hour long , and i still have 57mb left  .
i am a 50 yr old woman , and this is my first player  .
i'm pretty techy (30 years of pcs)       which is good , because the out of box instructions neglect to tell you you need to unlock the player  .
once that hurdle is jumped , the rest is pretty much a self    explanatory breeze  .
dumped the shipped content , and added my own content manually       never into top 40 , so mostly it is not available as downloads  .
works fine for this , since i don't care about keeping albums together , or song order  .
audio quality of furnished buds is ok , but they are physically too big , and hurt my ears  .
navigation ring and side buttons are really neat once you get used to it  .
full    sized guy might find them difficult still looking for a good quality  single  earphone to use at work       we cannot have both ears blocked       have a kludge going with a 1/8 to 1/8 stereo to mono plug with a cheapie radio earplug       audio quality is pretty pitzy unit ran 10 hours straight with power to spare  .
probably will run longer       this is not end of power unit runs the car cassette converter to car speakers fine there is no dedicated ac to usb charger available  .
asked sandisk for voltage/amperage of battery       was told 3  .
7v and amperage is 'proprietary'  .
they insist you have to charge the unit through the xp computer ; however my 98se box (which detects it as new hardware but there is no suitable driver) will charge the battery thru usb , so likely the charger regulator is in the player  .
found out that most usb connectors are 5v 500ma       disney (of all people) has a 5v 500ma disney mix stick ac to usb converter which i am using with the silicone jacket , everyone mistakes it for an ipod  .
even though it comes with an ad for rhapsody , it's doing just fine with walmart downloads of a few songs i didn't own the fm radio is not so hot       tends to pull in rock/rap stations much better than country/eclectic  .
cannot get a couple of 5kw stations i listen to easily on other tiny radios have not used the other video/photo features yet .
sansa e250    a customer review  .
this is a great unit  .
with all its foibles i'd buy it again just because it does so much more than other similar machines at the same price break  .
menu setup is easy to figure out without a manual  .
please understand that while what i say below sounds negative , it's still an excellent machine  .
these are things you'll want to consider before you buy it  .
i'm betting other machines aren't nearly as advanced  .
i'm hoping sandisk will see this review and attempt to make changes in future firmware updates sound is clear  .
between tracks you can hear a high    pitched chirping noise that sounds charmingly like a cd player deciding what song it will play next  .
albums do not play through directly , but leave gaps between each song along with that lovely cd chirp  .
it takes about 30 seconds for the unit to boot while the unit feels substantial in the hand , the plastic of the display face is very delicate  .
think of it like a cd crystal case only smaller  .
i bought the silicone holder to protect it , and is taking it off to get a closer look at the microsd slot , when it fell about six inches to a hard surface  .
it didn't fall on the front side , but that's what ended up cracking    right in front of the display  .
don't put this unit in your jeans pocket  .
just sitting could crack the front  .
they can make a cellphone that doesn't break when you drop it from desk height to the floor  .
they should do likewise with mp3 players  .
mine only dropped six inches the voice recorder is okay  .
don't expect to do much more than keep audio notes  .
i recorded full conversations on a class trip to a forest with some success , but it's unlikely that you will be able to prove that you heard the endangered ivory    billed woodpecker with this unit the video conversion tool is ultimately useless  .
it doesn't recognize some mp4 docs  .
bulk conversion can only be achieved with whatever space you have left on the unit  .
you cannot just designate a place on your computer hard    drive for converted movies  .
a 100mb photoshoptv podcast (higher resolution , better quality sound) got tranlated into five files that were directly uploaded to the machine  .
you would think with the resultant video being less than half the original pixel dimensions , you'd get a 20mb to 50mb file  .
instead it balloons into 5 segmented files , 4 of which were 127mb  .
sound is seriously downgraded to boot  .
files would not play consecutively and froze during and between segments  .
find another tool to convert your files because this one is more than entirely lame  .
sandisk should be embarrassed for having even included it the ear buds are very uncomfortable and don't fit at all ergonomically    and i don't have small ear canals , but they emit superb quality sound  .
if you don't want sore ears , be prepared to buy another pair of ear buds there should be a 'stop' button  .
i don't want to just mute the radio  .
i don't want to just pause the mp3  .
i like that you can pause mid    song , turn off the unit , turn it back on , unpause the song and continue from where you were  .
i don't like that it doesn't remember the volume you were listening at  .
volume returns to the default center setting every time you turn off the unit  .
there is a 'normal' and 'high' volume setting in the 'settings' mode  .
the unit comes at default setting 'high  .
' i'm not sure this really does anything  .
it might have been better to include a default volume bar setting  .
the volume bar is controlled by the dial with thirty distinct volume levels  .
with the bar all the way to the left it's mute , but still playing  .
they've wasted the next setting level on the bar because it also is mute  .
the next tick on the bar is too loud for listening in a very quiet room or if you want to listen to music while you sleep  .
i left the volume set to the default center position for several hours yesterday evening , and my ears are ringing this morning  .
while it may seem okay to raise the volume when you're in loud room or out in a breezy forest , you're actually stealing your hearing from when you're much older  .
the ipod generation is growing up deaf  .
if you want to hear your grandchildren laugh , keep the volume low  .
if you cannot hear it , turn it off or hook it to external speakers i can selectively delete voice recordings on the unit  .
i should be able to selectively delete mp3's and mov's when i need to make room for more voice recordings without having to sync up to my computer  .
after all , they are just copies of what's on my computer anyway , right  .
time and date should be showing at all times somewhere on screen  .
right now , all you can glimpse is time , and that's when nothing is playing  .
why include the setting if you aren't going to display it  .
while an mp3 is playing , you can toggle between the song duration bar , a live equalizer reading , and a peek at the name of the next song  .
you cannot leave the toggle set to either of the last two  .
in about 7 seconds , it goes back to the duration bar  .
for songs that are in long folder names , you will never get to know what the name of the next song is because 7 seconds is not long enough for the entire name to scroll by  .
sansa , unless you're going to include manual equalizer settings drop the equalizer reading bar you can only edit the 'go list' on the playlists from the unit  .
you have to actually listen to a song to add it to the go list  .
playlists are only created in windows media player and can only be brought over via sync  .
i want to be able to edit the play order , add , and delete items from playlists from the unit without having to do it from wmp10  .
i'd like to be able to rename my playlists , reorder them and play my playlists consecutively this unit comes with a flimsy velvet sleeve that    you guessed it    does not let you see the display or use the controls  .
why did they even bother  .
something this fragile should come with a sturdy flip    top protective arm band or a belt clip  .
a wall charger should also have been included with the unit i'd like to see this unit synced with winamp as well as wmp10 this is by far the most helpful webpage for anyone buying this product    .

com/archives/2006/03/sandisk    sansa    e200    series    review  .
php  .
this page gives lots of information about firmware updates  .
you will probably need to do one with that said , sandisk seems committed to getting it right  .
i hope future firmware updates will include the ability to play ogg and mp4 files , as well as the above suggested changes in the display interface .
the sandisk sensa e250 is a great mp3 player that has a wide file format support , good sound quality and very nice look and feel to the unit  .
the software interface is simple and effective and the expansion slot presents the unit with increased storage capacity  .
fm radio is a nice touch , i am not sure i'd use it much , but it's nice to know it's there  .
price on the unit is right , got it (2gb unit) from best buy for $149 on sale  .
compared feature , build , and price against the nano , this unit beats it hand down in my book  .
i use it for gym and jogging , it fits nicely into an arm band designed for an ipod mini even the control wheel location are perfectly placed  .
the unit itself fits snugly into the arm band even though the unit is quite a bit smaller than the mini (i am assuming an ipod mini would really stretch the pouch quite a bit) and the snap on the pouch overs the unit and holds it firmly in place  .
the control of the unit take a bit getting use to , but once acquainted , it's intuitive and effective two bits of complaint on the unit  .
first is the playlist ( go list ) can only generated while playing a track  .
the list is generated by adding actively playing sound tracks via user input , there is no way to generate playlists on the computer and then transfer the lists to the unit , everything playlist wise is done on the fly while using the unit  .
this does not bother me too much since i mostly use the shuffle play all feature , but it would be nice to have better playlist management  .
second is the battery is only charged while connect to the usb port , there is no separate battery charger , not even as a separate aftermarket unit from sandisk  .
this forces the unit to be connected to the computer for charging the battery  .
if the computer goes into power save mode and shuts down the usb port , battery charging will get interrupted , so the computer have to be fully power on just to charge the unit , it's a bit annoying despite these minor complaints , sensa e250 performs its core functionality exceedingly well which is to provide a well built mp3 player in a small , attractive package .
i've had my sansa e250 for a few days now and i really do like it  .
this is the first mp3 player i've ever owned , so i still feel as if i have a lot to learn about all of the different functions  .
i do not plan to utilize the device for viewing photos or videos , so i cannot speak as to the quality of those particular features  .
however , the music sounds great , the menu is easy to navigate and i like the fact that it has fm the only drawback for me is that there is not a stop button on the player  .
also , this is the second e250 i've purchased ; the first froze up on me and i had to return it  .
i did buy a replacement and so far , so good incidentally , i did a lot of research on mp3 players prior to my purchase ; i eventually narrowed down my choices to the e250 and the i    pod nano  .
i chose the sansa primarily because it is compatible with subscription music services and had a user replaceable battery .
got this as a refurbished unit from microcenter for $35  .
buy  .
com had similar deals at the time of purchase  .
for the price , a very worthwhile product  .
refurbished came only with earbuds (mediocre quality , too big to fit in ear       but i have several sets of earbuds already) and usb connector       nothing else , not even instructions or software  .
i am a podcast fanatic       usually lectures , news , science , etc  .
i broke my all    in    one cellphone and have a year left on the contract , so i looked for a cheap mp3 player  .
for the price , i am very pleased  .
worked right out of the box with windows media player  .
the usb port charges the e250 as well as syncing  .
i downloaded the audio book 1776 by historian david mccullough who also read the book  .
his rich voice came through clear and crisp  .
this is an 11 hour recording and the e250 is not designed to navigate through the 11 hours easily  .
there is no bookmark capability to leave the book to listen to another mp3 and then return  .
but no other mp3 players at the price range i am willing to spend have that feature either the construction feels substantial  .
it is as long as a credit card but the width is narrower  .
the display is bright  .
the thumb wheel is slightly awkward but not bad  .
the controls take a little bit of getting used to , but again not bad , especially considering the price  .
it does not feel fragile       although i will treat it carefully i will see if i can download the software that comes with the new unit  .
even if i cannot , it still is a good purchase (although it requires the software for the videos) i am pleased .
i bought this player from circuit city last week ($79  .
99)  .
basically i like it very much because it has all the features i need the problems i have are the video files too big (160m for only 10 mins) and you can not change it  .
when you play music or listen to radio , you can not stop it  .
i called them and they told me to turn off and then turn on  .
i like it because it has fm and fm recorder and voice recorder , and fm signal is very good  .
it has two usb modes , msc or mtp  .
i like msc since it transfer data fast and easier , no need wmp11  .
i rerurned it because the video problem and no stop for radio and music  .
its earbud hurt my ear  .
i may purchase it later if sandisk fix these bugs .
i got the sansa about a week ago and i love it  .
the songs play well and even though the screen isnt all that big the videos look nice  .
but today when i is deleting i came across a problem  .
after i went to my computer and deleted the songs when i looked at the songs on my playlists the songs that i had just deleted were still there  .
but when i went to play them it said bad song and the songs would not play and it skipped to the next song  .
so i went back to my computer to try to delete the songs again the files of the songs was not on there  .
so the songs haad been deleted but there names were stil showing up  .
if anybody knows how to solve this problem please let me know .
i'm a 50 + guy and this is my first mp3 player  .
i just never got around to it til now  .
what i like about this player is that i can use micro sd card to increase memory (i use the 1 gb i got for cell phone that i do not use) as memory capacity for these cards increases i should have increased storage ( i hope)  .
the card is simply inserted in slot and the player recognizes automatically i cannot speak to sound quality as i have not listened to other players , plus i'm over 50 and likely have hearing loss from the 70's  .
sounds good to me  .
plan to use in car with fm adapter (not yet purchased)  .
the best thing i like about this player is that it is not an ipod  .
i hate the big guys and usually will search for a product other than what everybody else has .
nice unit , great features , good price all the good stuff everyone else said  .
but i found the sound to be pretty weak  .
took it to the gym and the gym overhead speakers were overpowering my headphones and i had mine on near max (which i've never done with an ipod)  .
on the subways in nyc , same problem quiet songs are totally drowned out by surrounding area also , if you get the armband i warn you , they had a stupid stupid design flaw  .
the little jacket for the mp3 player does not have an opening for the hold lock switch , so you basically have to pull the thing out of the sleeve in order to unlock the player  .
and in order to pull the mp3 player out of the sleeve , you'll have to unplug the headphones  .
just another minor inconvenience .
i have the 2gb player and i am having trouble deleting songs and folders  .
i formatted it four times all ready and upgraded the firmware    it still seizes and fails to recognize mp3s that it allowed me to download before  .
i will call the customer service department to get to the bottom of this , but it still irks me quite a bit  .
i would have given it a 10 if it had not been for this hassle .
one thing i almost forget in the cons is the really delicate headphone connection in this player , if the headphones are yanked the connector inside the player will die taking the player with it , the wav file type only recording , with the big size file problems in the cons actually come to a wish list , that could easily be fixed with a software upgrade  .
otherwise this will be as close as possible to the ideal player  .
the ability to swap memory cards is a real plus that will liberate you from memory limitations forever , specially now , that you can buy 2 gig cards for less that $10 , and have unlimited capacity in your player  .
if you can cope with carrying around and shuffling a handful of fingernail size memory cards , not bad for the unlimited storage feature and do not forget that you can find the 2 gb factory refurbished units (no cd software included) for around $29  .
99 , as i found my second e250 player in a labor day special  .
i is looking for a good quality player with good features , a reasonable price , and something that was not an ipod (seeing as ipods fit none of that  .
) i found this one and it fit those characteristics so i bought it  .
since then i have been happy with it for the most part  .
the sound quality has been good , and the player functions well and is easy to use , and customer support has been very helpful  .
the only downsides are its durability and occasional software malfunctions  .
i found that the screen cracks very easily (note to recent or potential buyers , get a case  .
)as for the software issues , i have found doubling of tracks and deleting of tracks  .
those were my only big issues with the player  .
great product for the thrifty of beginnging mp3 user .
i updated the firmware on my new sansa 250e  .
followed their exact instructions everything went well until it is finished and rebooted  .
the player went down and never came back up (white screen)  .
contacted the suport center and they said to send in the player , which i did  .
no updates on the rma were freely given so i called and emailed  .
it has been 2 months and i still do not have a replacement mp3 player  .
they have no eta and none in stock  .
if you buy this player and something goes wrong after 30 days  .
you may never see another one  .
i am very discouraged .
here's the deal , i read a lot of great things on the internet about this gadget , and i is convinced  .
so i went to best buy , they were out of stock , i went to future shop and bought it at the cheaper best buy price  .
brought it home , all is fine , until the next morning  .
when i tried to turn it on , the scroll wheel illuminated and the screen wouldn't turn on  .
so i went to future shop and exchanged it for a new one  .
take 2   i went home and started transfering music onto it  .
after 2 hours i got about 40 songs , i'm not technologically challenged and my computer is not slow , the software is just terrible  .
then i start listening to some music  .
first thing i do not like is that the maximum volume is way too low  .
if i were to listen to this near traffic it would be totally drowned  .
then , i wanted to add some bass to my techno and i just bought some extravagant mdr    v500dj headphones from sony , but the bass is extremelly dissapointing finally , i gave up  .
went to future shop , got a refund , went to sony store and bought an nw    1000  .
bottom line   this very beautiful mp3/picture/video player is just not ready to face the competition  .
the video playback would be the strongest point i would see , but with terrible video sound quality , and such a small screen , it's really pointless .
sorry sandisk , mine had to be returned to costco and i will probably now buy a creative mp3 my main reason for buying this is to record from the fm modulator on my satellite radio  .
i leave my mp3 player in my car every morning and record howard stern's 5+ hour show while i am in work  .
i set the modulator in my sattelite radio to broadcast on 88  .
3 fm and use my mp3 player to record 88  .
3 fm and set them next to each other i come out at about 11am or noon to stop the recording and then take the player into work so i can listen to the show and fast    forward through commercials i found out after getting my sandisk e250 that it would only record about 2 hours (or less) maximum while left unattended  .
after speaking with sandisk tech support i is told that all of their e200 models ( 2 , 4 6gb) have the same limitation  .
they state that they use a diffrent compression for fm recording that limits capacity  .
the higher gig models can hold more fm recordings but will stop at the 2    hour mark  .
not suitable for my needs or for anyone who records fm shows that may exceed 2 hours i have an iclick sohlo g5 ( 1 gig )that i have had numerous problems with , but it will record endless hours of fm  .
the e250 is supposed to replace that but now it won't my other gripes are   no a/c adaptor  .
you can only charge it through usb  .
does everyone but me carry around their computer while traveling to charge usb itmes  .
why are manufactures not putting line    in recording on all their mp3 players  .
i would love to go from the headphone jack on my satellite radio directly into the mp3 player to record how about vcr    type recording timers , fast forward selctions to jump ahead 5    10 minutes ( to get through commercials) why don't companies ask people what features they would like instead of giving us what they want  .
i know ipod is the standard of the industry , but until they put fm tuners/ recording on their units they wo not get my hard    earned money  .
i bought my sansa e250 about three weeks ago (may 9)  .
i charged it up and is uploading music in no time       my computer found the player and it is very easy to upload tunes from windows media player i listen to the radio quite a bit and the reception and sound quality are much better than my rio  .
loading photo and video is easy too , after installing the software , just drag the file into the window and it converts and uploads in one step i didn't find the click wheel to be bothersome , it's easy to change the volume when i'm running  .
the menus could be more intuitive , but they're still pretty good i bought a silicone case for it and even with a number of trips to the gym and going to work with me every day i still don't have any scratches on it , though the screen is a fingerprint    magnet where i did run into trouble is that in between the gym and work one day (may 20) , after i powered it down , it would not power back up  .
i wrote tech support , they responded to do a soft boot (hold power button 20 seconds) and then connect it to the computer and reformat it  .
the problem was , the computer wouldn't recognize the player without any power , thus no reformatting  .
i sent a response to tech support asking what to do next two days later (may 22) , i tried again , and it powered up  .
a day after that , same problem       powered down at lunchtime , and haven't been able to get it back up  .
i still have not heard back from tech support again about reformatting it when it's dead , and i'm not going to wait any longer i will be returning the sansa to the store from which i bought it  .
i loved it , but i'm not willing to put up it .
when i got my sansa e250 it is great for a couple months  .
until one day when i is transfering music onto it from my computer it froze and shut off  .
now i figured it is a one time thing but it did it several times  .
then when i finally got it back on i came to find that a folder filled with 150 songs had been deleted  .
i don't know if it is just mine but this player is a freezaholic  .
now i cannot even connect it to my computer anymore  .
it just turns on and then turns off  .
so naturally i bought a new mp3 player , the creative zen v plus  .
much better a little smaller screen , but at least this one wo not freeze .
if you don't have rhapsody , there's no reason to buy this device  .
it's horribly designed in both hardware and software       it seems like it is made for left    handed people who enjoy clumsy menu navigation i will appreciate reaplaceable battery , but who knows how much the (proprietary  .
) replacement will cost  .
the screen is nice  .
the patent    avoiding scroll wheel makes the device feel like one of those fake cell phones with candy inside  .
the expansion slot is nice in theory , but as far as i can tell , the software doesn't accomodate rhapsody transfer to the microsd expansion card all in all , it's a badly    done ipod nano knock    off  .
it's also does not get along with macs  .
but you can fill it with free music every day .
i've owned my player for 1 month and wanted to offer a realistic review once i've really used it  .
buy the extended warranty in case you need to return it here are the peculiar problems    .
songs that i purchased are not playing  .
the error indicates i need to sync up and authorize to continue playing  .
this should not happen with songs you own (only the subscription ones) 2  .
while viewing the demo video , the battery suddenly died (although fully charged)  .
the display went black but the blue neon light around the control disk stayed on  .
no buttons functioned  .
i let the battery completely drain overnight and then fully recharged the next day  .
that seems to have fixed it for now  .
hope it doesn't happen again  .
odd 3  .
using the rhasody subscription service , the songs download , but then does not play  .
very frustrating  .
i've had to re    download several songs to finally get them to play  .
way too much time spent at the computer to just download songs 4  .
not sure if it's the player or rhapsody software , but when i'm downloading rhapsoday hangs (or perhaps its the player) who knows  .
but it happens far too often  .
as a point of comparison , i also own an older model iriver player and download songs using a napster subscription service and it never hangs  .
i'm doing my own comparison and eventually i intend on cancelling one of them  .
i've updated my rhapsody software to the most current version and updated the e250's firmware and that did solve the hanging problem  .
having to reboot rhapsody and reload subscription songs and songs you own is the pitts overall i like the player when it works  .
but then there's the problem of thinking a song downloaded and it did not  .
when the player encounters the song (that wont play) , the song is displayed for a quick moment , the player skips the track and plays the next playable song  .
very frustrating  .
i hate the frequent download halts and having to reboot to re    do the download  .
i hate that the player skips songs that it cant play  .
you have to note which song it is and head back to the computer  .
i just want to download my songs quickly and easily and be on my way so once you have all the songs you want to hear and they actually play on the e250 you're in for a good time .
i really liked this mp3 player at first  .
it did everything i needed and more  .
it played my mp3's just fine , it had video playback and even an ok radio  .
after about 6 months , any new songs i would put on there were not recognized  .
i tried doing everything i could think of , but it would not recognize them and it is very frustrating  .
i tried deleteing all my songs , but it had a lot of weird folder names like a square for a name  .
it would not let me delete the songs or folders  .
now , it froze and it wont work anymore  .
my sister also got one and her battery never lasted as long as my battery  .
it only lasted about 7 hours and never got a full charge  .
s , it seems like if you get good one , it's worth it , but it seems like chances are you will get one that is defective in some way .
i set it up w/ rhapsody because that is what you have to do to install and update the unit  .
when i used yahoo it recognized the player , but as soon as i tried to drag a song into the player that i got off of yahoo it said that i had to sign up for yahoo    2    go  .
i already have that and have had no problems w/ my iriver  .
when i used the rhapsody player to transfer songs , it would let me but when i tried to listen to them i is told to update my subscription though i just logged in that morning and all my songs were updated so that was not the problem  .
i'm taking it back  .
i already paid for a year of service from yahoo , so this sux .
i would love this device if they could make it more stable  .
i bought it specifically for the gym and found it useless when it kept skipping during my treadmill runs .
sorry guys  .
i don't see the 8  .
3 rating here at all  .
i've had mine for about 6 days at this writing  .
i'm happy with the size    truly a shirtpocket's dream  .
the controls aren't that bad and the buttons are a mite difficult to find as they're below the profile of the wheel  .
but it takes some getting used to  .
the audio level is about perfect    some good punch in there where this unit goes south is the management of the system itself , loading of songs and playlist controls  .
i hope sansa gets someone to write some software for it because using wmp 10 is a frustrating experience  .
users will find that turning on a fully loaded unit will take on average as much as 45 secs or more to refresh database  .
a pain    when i use mine now i just leave it play knowing i'll miss some songs as i'm in and out of the car a lot (note you have to buy the cassette adapter separately)  .
now without specially written software handlers you're forced into using something like wmp  .
i'm sure microsoft didn't know exactly what flash players were going to look and feel like so let's not be too harsh  .
buyers should note that just adding songs to the e250 can be a trial and error extravaganza  .
you have to know for example , that if your already existing wmp playlists have duplicate songs in them which is not unusual , the e250/wmp combination will let you accrete duplicates to the memory with no warning (a potential waste of space)  .
ok , not a big issue for most except the big drawback with this is that there is no on    board deletion facility on the e250    meaning that in order to merely remove one or two songs , you have to connect the thing up and yes , wait another 45 seconds for refresh database  .
after the deletion takes place , disconnecting often invokes another refresh database as well  .
so all this makes you think seriously about going through this torture just to erase something  .
you cannot move a song from one playlist to another playlist either nor can you add songs to playlists solely by the e250  .
when it's connected to the usb port for any purpose , play will stop and you'll have no e250 until you disconnect it  .
it has something called a go playlist where you can quickly poke in songs from the overall list or a playlist but you have to play the song first before moving it  .
this takes more time again and interrupts what listening you are doing when setting up a go  .
a go list also clears completely when a synch is performed    so don't spend a lot of effort setting up a nice list there  .
i wish i understood why the e250 puts each artist in his/her own windows folder  .
when you explore the '250 you find a bewildering supply of folders that you have to individually open sometimes 2    3 layers deep to see what songs are contained therein  .
oh , don't forget you have to set it to msc mode before you use the explore interface 'cause you'll wind up having to disconnect it which will cause a refresh database  .
is not this fun  .
small item    right now my e250 tells me there are 583 songs on board    wmp can only find 109 of them  .
and synching with wmp can be a real headscratcher    especially if you turn on automatic synch  .
i had playlist a , b and c on my computer and chose to synch a    this went ok  .
so i went back in to synch b and c only to find that when i'd deselected a in wmp , it in fact automatically took a completely out  .
you have to remember to keep the ones you want synched checked on all the time  .
i've disabled auto    sych now so i have more control  .
would have been nice to know that beforehand but the lack of instructions for the whole system just adds to the steepness of the learning curve  .
buyers will find that after a pause which exceeds the auto    shut down threshold (which is settable) the e250 has to be turned back on and yes , wait another 45 seconds plus to refresh database  .
with all this synching , i've had numerous occasions where i select a song out of the overall list only to find the e250 playing the selection just above or below the target  .
when this happens , the only out is to turn it off and on and , well , you probably guessed it i inserting a 1 gb microsd and haven't yet figured out how to populate it with song material  .
once i reach the 2 gb limit on board i'm told no more songs can be added  .
no documentation , no instructions  .
the e250 is married to the usb port  .
if you don't have one on your machine don't get this one  .
i don't know why they could not have sprung for a wall wart power supply either in sum , i is very happy with it at first because it is cool and now that i've used it some , i'm seriously thinking of taking it back before my 30 day trial is up  .
sorry guys    i give it a 5 .
i love how it integrates into rhapsody  .
the playback is excellent , and i always use the random song features which works well  .
however , if you hit something , it displays no files and goes dead until you again sync it up with where you got the music (rhapsody for me)  .
as soon as no files shows up it's gone for the duration  .
i've tried emailing sandisk support and received no answer  .
and i'm so disappointed since i love it otherwise .
i is very happy as i got my first mp3 player  .
this one  .
but as the years pass , you see that there is more songs in the whole doggon world  .
so i decided to get a 2 gb micro for more room  .
did that work  .
the voice recording time will still not rise  .
that's one complaint  .
the other is that the video playing is very difficult  .
if you fast foward , it will take a long time to get around to certain parts  .
also , there is no duritation time bar  .
it sorta is confusing  .
if you want to buy this mp3 , buy it just for the songs updated  .
on apr 14 , 2009  .
i have a rhapsody subscription and purchased this player to use with my workouts  .
the songs i transferred frequently displayed the message that needed to renew the subscription daily and would not play the songs , even though it is a monthly subscription  .
i is never able to correct the problem , despite every suggestion i received  .
i would not purchase this model again .
three days after i got it dust got under the screen cover to the point that the display is almost unreadable if this had not happened i would have kept it instead of exchanging it for a ipod nano  .
the center wheel cant be used easily  .
can hear noise in the background  .
audio out not good  .
stopped working in a month  .
no flexibility in creating folders in the player  .
the basic sound volume is very low  .
when i got a sansa e250 i thought i is getting a good mp3 player for the price , but instead what i got is a good example for form    over    function and the most infuriating mp3 player i've ever tried to use one major problem you'll see right off with the sansa   it has no software of it's own for managing music  .
instead , it makes you use windows media player  .
there are a number of things wrong with this , both involving windows media player and the way the device uses that against you first of all , windows media player is not a very friendly piece of software when you're trying to use it to upload music to a device  .
i spent 20 minutes trying to upload canto alla vita by josh groban because when the player ran out of memory instead of just telling me the memory is too low the media player decided for me which music i should want off of it and immediately stopped synchronization and all further attempts to upload canto alla vita were met with media player trying to upload the same exact song it had just erased now here's where it stops being just lousy software on microsoft's part and becomes horrendous design on sandisk's part    there are two usb modes    msc and mtp  .
the sansa must be in mtp mode to interact with windows media player  .
there's also a slot to put a micro sd card in to expand the available memory on the player but to do this you need to disconnect the player , switch the blasted thing to msc mode , and plug it back in and manually move any remaining music over to the sd card  .
it's just too much trouble and while parts of it are flaws in the way windows media player is designed it still doesn't excuse sandisk from being too lazy to make their own software for music management now that i went through all that trouble for one lousy song , time to turn it back to mtp mode to listen to the music for some reason while in mtp mode when you disconnect the player it doesn't feel the need to restart but it does if you disconnect it in msc mode  .
once again , it's probably an issue with windows media player , but still an issue that could have been easily fixed had sandisk been able to comprehend how to make their own software you cannot forget how long it takes to start up the player either  .
seriously , you cannot  .
it takes forever updating it's library or whatever it says after a few times you just become so numb to it all you know is it's wasting your time and you just don't care anyway for as much as i complain about how sandisk didn't make their own software for managing music , they did make a video converter that takes any decently sized video and converts it to the only format the sansa recognizes    a ridiculously large file format  .
also , if you just spent all your time uploading music to the device and made the common    sense and completely logical assumption you'd be able to upload video to the sd card you'll find you were quite wrong  .
for reasons probably no one understands you can only upload video to the main mp3 player  .
mixed with the ridiculous size of videos , if you want to play any moves you need to empty out 3/4 of the mp3 player to do so and don't get me started on playlist management either  .
for some reason it is decided for you that you should only ever want to use one playlist , a playlist that the sansa refers to as the golist  .
if you want another playlist you need to go back to the media player , use music on your computer to make the playlist while hoping you do not accidentally overload the sansa and have to go through the ordeal described above and when you get it put onto your player you'll realize that should you wish to add any more music to it you cannot  .
you need to go back to the windows media player because sandisk hates you , tweak the playlist from there once again using music on your computer rather than the mp3 player in the same ordeal i just described , and then sync it to the player again  .
it becomes very annoying very fast prior to this i had a creative jukebox zen and for my next mp3 player i'm getting another zen .
in general the hardware is great  .
great sound , the buttons are ok  .
great design and battery life  .
the only problem is the screen  .
it got scratched because i pit it in my pocket along with the ear buds that came with the player  .
and no i didn� t sit on them ��` i just walked the software is just ⬦ disrespectful for the client and it feels like no thought is put in it (and i am being demanding here because it� s sandisk expensive product) let� s start with the navigation inside the mp3  .
when i bought this player one thing i is certain about and it� s that the wheel is for navigation inside the mp3 and not for vulume  .
why do you need so fast control of the volume  .
and not that the volume is sequential it just has number of levels  .
on the other hand , instead of pushing the right or left button for three hours in a big mp3 (so many people use audio books now) it would be much easier with the provided wheel � just roll and you� re done another thing is that you cannot put breakpoints inside an mp3  .
oh come oooon (this feature exists in the creative zen and other players) it� s so easy to do (i am a software engineer)  .
when you play mp3 it remembers the last point you where on  .
but if you go to a video that� s it , it� s gone along with even the song you where at when you click for a second on the middle button on the sansa c series (much more basic players) you get the song to be added the on the fly list  .
in e200 series it just extra play/pause button � huuuuuuuuge waist and horrrrible design  .
to add to the so called �son the fly�� list you have to click on menu and then scroll to the right action and select it � wow everything but �son the fly�� why there is no option scrolling by libraries  .
it exists in so many other players and a lot of people would find it very helpful (and it� s so easy to implement) the screen is great � 1  .
but guess what , you will never use the full screen but for the menu � haha what a joke the video format  .
are you kidding me  .
using the mov format that instead of decreasing the size of the file it multiplies it and this is in flash memory player  .
the most stupid person knows that if the resolution is lower (the screen is smaller than pc screen) the file is smaller � not with sandisk  .
not to mention that the converting problem just crushes sometime on some files the start up time is really slow  .
my pc starts up faster (win xp) when it� s fresh installation the expansion card that they are so proud about is not too helpful either  .
because it �srefreshes�� the database each time it turns on ( another 7    8 seconds)  .
i came up with an explanation for that � it has to show you updated information and it doesn� t know what you did with the card while the player is off  .
well here is the solution make a tiny text file (could be xml or whatever) and store the info  .
just say to refresh the database if the card is out while the player is off all above is already implemented software  .
all you have to do is just use it hope it is helpful and hope that some sandisk representative will read it also .
if you are looking for a great music player with an fm tuner and a picutre view , then the sansa lines are great  .
do not expect much from the video end of it if you want to put video longer than a music video on it i have been trying to download programs recorded off of my dvr to the program , using converstion to avi or wmv for moble media player after getting no help off the user forums , i finally got a hold of someone at the help desk (with an accent of course)  .
they told me that they are aware of the bug and that i need to break the video down to 10 minute segments , this will avoid the audio lag after fastforwarding through commercials personally , in the day and age of moble everything , this should have been at least looked into before designing the unit i am not really looking for anyone to comment on my inability to determine what should have worked prior to buying this unit  .
i know that no unit will meet my 100% needs , but when you spend that kind of money ($175 for the e280) , there are certian expectations my $0  .
02 worth  .
at sight , this may be a serious contender agains the apple ipod nano , however the buggy software and hardware glitches just ruin this player  .
i have had the sansa e250 for about 3 months and the cons outweigh the pros  .
avoid it if you can , you'll save yourself a few headaches in the future .
poor quality , tech service willing to try everything but replace product  .
scandisk needs to rethink how it deals with customer issues .
if i did not want to create separate playlists for certain types of songs i would give the sanso e250 an 11 out of 10 rating  .
i have called sandisk twice and emailed them once  .
each time i get a slightly different response , none of which work  .
i have searched high and low on the internet reading reviews and suggestions for overcoming this from others  .
i have found no complete accurate instructions for doing this  .
in fact , there are a lot of folks complaining about the difficulty of creating a playlist on this mp3 player my request is simple          i want only 2 playlists   vocal and instrumental  .
i download songs from rhapsody and follow their directions  .
all the songs go into songs on the e250  .
i cannot get them to go into the playlist category  .
a few have found their way into the appropriate playlist (which is created at one point but i have no idea how  .
) , but most have not  .
also , some songs duplicate themselves , others do not show up on rhapsody's list of songs on my device or media player's list of songs on my device  .
i have no clue as to how to delete songs or get them to the playlist  .
i am at a complete loss  .
i have also noticed that when looking at the file folders on media player it lists my 2 playlists , but they do not open  .
and should not there be a list or file on media player that shows all of the songs on my mp3  .
as of now some , but not all , show up  .
i am confused and very frustrated  .
if i cannot get this figured out soon i will have to return it if anyone has clear , specific directions (including all necessary steps) for creating playlists and having the songs go into those playlists instead of the general songs category or the to go category i'd give the e250 the 11 it would deserve  .
please help me  .
the player will not delete songs fromt he music library as outlined in the users manual  .
not sure that i want to reformat the player just be be able to update my music library  .
let me start with this is my first non    ipod mp3 player i have gotten  .
i have used this player multiple times a week for months note   this opinion is based on a refurbished unit  .
pros (things i like)  .
size and weight  .
screen  .
built in fm radio (and radio recorder)  .
battery life  .
sound quality is on    par with ipod  .
cons  .
does not come with software or any documentation br  .
no warranty ( i called the sandisk on a problem and their customer service said i is no my own and the unit had no warranty)  .
the critical public web sansa setup setting information to get the unit to work with the mac is hard to locate (switch usbmode to msc , dump your tunes to the music folder and undock) http  //rjdohnert  .
wordpress  .
com/2007/09/22/fed    up    with    mp3    players/       one source  .
a plastic corner of my unit came chipped  .
the control wheel has a cheap feeling  .
the unit auto turns on when connected to a computer that is turned off (therefore you go to use the unit in the morning and it is usually died)  .
2gb is too small and the addon card port only seems to be a transfer volume .
i bought this player in hope that i would finally have a portable electronic that wouldn't break down but i is wrong the second day i had it , i loaded some music and pictures from my pc to it  .
unfortunately , it always blocks when it gets to the refresh database screen  .
it goes a sixth of the way then just blocks  .
the clock does not work , it just crashed this is after i updated the firmware on it though so it might've been a firmware problem .
it is a small , nice mp3 player  .
it is also thicker than nano which is nice nano is too thin  .
anyways but the biggest problem with e250 series is that it has a major glitch in software that sometimes once you recharge it , you plug it out of the pc then the songs are gone you plug it back in the songs are there but somehow they dont show up on the mp3 player  .
i dono if it is just afew ones or everyone has had this problem , because i've heard afew people complain about this and others havent  .
and mine took only a couple this for this problem so it is only the 4th recharge that revealed this problem  .
anyways im returning mine  .
big crucial problem .
cnet says the samsung e250 has everything , and i could not agree more , except for one major factor  .
some songs that are loaded onto the system are later self deleted or unrecognizable  .
for example , songs that are loaded and recognizable from windows platform , are nonexistent when accessing from the mp3 player  .
i've own 3 creatives , an earlier sandisk , and a ipod and never ran across this  .
this is extremely horrible and i'm most definitely going to return this .
one major software flaw , read first , then read    on if it doesn't bother you  .
cnet editors should have caught this one  .
if anyone from sansa reads this and has some software patch for me to try , please contact me by email   while a track is playing , if you navigate the music list down about 5+ song titles beyond the current one and push enter to select the new song , the current song being played back starts distorting and slowing down in pitch for about 5 seconds until the new song gets loaded  .
this is pretty consistent regardless of title  .
it's as if the processor cannot handle the decoding and loading at the same time  .
the same thing will happen on the tracks of your go list  .
my guess is moving beyond a number of songs after the current requires some buffering which overloads the processor the user interface on this device is smart , intuitive , easy to use and packs a lot of functionality at your fingertips playback audio is good , however , however you'll find yourself maxing out the volume level when playing through larger headphones have not figured out or if you even can , create a playlist on the pc and transfer it to the unit  .
you can create a playlist on the unit and then rename the playlist in wmp  .
however , more tedious to do this  .
i    tunes is much better at playlisting  .
probably the best software out there for doing so the blue dial , when lit is cool , however , when not lit , looks look cheap translucent pvc , as if you took a juice box straw and bent it around in a circle .
i loved it at first easy to load music , pretty durable  .
then 3 months into ownership , the dratted thing died  .
tried to update software per website    no help lots of confusion  .
sandisk is no help  .
next mp3 player will be an ipod .
this player stopped working about 5 months after i purchased it  .
sandisk deemed it to be defective and replaced it  .
the replacement player failed again for firmware or software issues about a year later , and now sandisk tells me its defective but wont replace it or help me fix the problem  .
guess im just out of luck  .
i will not buy any sandisk products again  .
anyone have a good recommendation for a different mp3 player for me  .
after about a year and a half , the e250 stopped working  .
it randomly deleted songs and sometimes wouldn't shut off or turn on  .
i figured the problem is that i needed a new battery  .
so i looked around , found it online at 2 stores , and paid $20 something for it  .
it took me about 3 months to find the battery and get it shipped to me because it is constantly out of stock  .
i received it today but my mp3 player still won't work  .
i don't know why but now it never turns on  .
i'm going to buy a new mp3 player  .
it's very frustrating  .
don't buy the sansa e250 unless you want a cheap mp3 player  .
i also purchased a sansa sandisk clip and that 1 stopped working after only 5 days  .
to me , sandisk sansa does not seem like a reliable brand .
i saw this at bestbuy and thought it looked good for the price  .
however , unlike the ipod nano where you can load about 1  .
8 gigs of your own material , the sansa e250 comes preloaded with about 1  .
5 gig of stuff , much of what you may not want  .
effectively , you are only able to put about 350mb of your own material on this , because that is all the free space available  .
so people buying this , thinking that they can put 500 of their own songs on it will be sadly disappointed  .
in fact , they can only put about 100 of their own songs on the device  .
in order to put 500 songs on , you would need to buy a 2 gig microsdchip for over $50  .
this wipes out the cost advantage versus a 2 gig ipod nano  .
the device stores movies , pictures , plays fm , mp3 , records etc  .
but like most devices that try to do everything , it does nothing very well  .
i found the click wheel and buttons to be difficult if you have large hands  .
the device also froze several times and before i understood you could reset it by holding down the menu button for 15 seconds , it is disconcerting to not be able to turn it off  .
i returned it and purchased a 2 gig nano .
i have looked around and the player is on sale ($159)  .
from the onset i is not impressed  .
the plug    n    play feature only works with the hold button turned off and then only on admin (privilage) winxp  .
the manual (online only from cd) is useless  .
you cannot move files around , even from the pc connection you have to delete them first then find them on your pc and copy them again  .
you can pause your music but not stop it  .
photos are really too small and get cropped  .
i put some family portraits on and the conversion software shrunk them so they did not even fit to the screen  .
the micro sd card is only good for music  .
it is quite heavy for it's size  .
the nav wheel is too near the bottom of the unit and is not a fun thing to use repeatedly  .
the unit sends song titles and artists and albums , genres etc  .
anywhere it seems fit  .
i put 5 folders on the player  .
one for each band  .
i filled the folders with about 10 songs respectfully  .
when i navigated to the menus i could not even find all the songs i look under album or artist and there would be one or two others were randomly put into country , jazz , alternative etc my daughter has had an ipod shuffle for over a year now load and play i also tried a diamond from wal    mart ($40) load , play , fm , playlist in some respects better than the e250 it is going back today  .
