i have to tell you guys , when we are in bali , we are looking for beach , nature , nice people , smiley faces , great hospitality , and i must say , i got it all in this hotel ! !
this is definitely not the newest hotel or the most hip hotel , but here . . .
i know almost all these people , familiar faces with great smiles , the touch of balinese , huge nature garden w/ all those beauties , 2 swimmingpool , one quiet pool in the middle of the garden , and one my favourite swimming pool directly in front of the beach ! !
no street in between to separate beach and this swimming pool , so convenient and beautiful ! !
love to hear the waves and watch some people playing water there . . .
laugh , love , life , family . . .
absolutely it 's my comfort ! !
even breakfast . . .
i love their breakfast , and somemore , breakfast heading to the swimmingpool and beach , how can you resist it , right ? ?
hahhaa i 've been staying in this hotel for about 15years , and i stay here almost every months ! ! !
hahah , and new year 2015 i was here too , and thanks to upgrade me to villa , which heading to the beach ! ! !
it 's marvelous ! ! !
love to the moon and back ! !
i must say , the room here is n't the type of new minimalist interior , but it 's the combination of modern contemporer and the touch of bali , and i 'm kinda like it , we are in bali , and it 's resort place , so . . .
that 's what we should feel , the feeling of relax with all those secluded , tranquility and serenity . . .
i love this villa , it 's villa no 106 , definitely right on the beach , and u can even enjoy ur wine/champagne or breakfast on this villa 's day bed , enjoying the beach in the same time . . .
i got little jacuzzi in the villa and livingroom , also kitchen . . .
and the bed w/ mosquito net . . .
somehow i feel like in my own kingdom . . .
hahhaha check some of my pictures ! !
