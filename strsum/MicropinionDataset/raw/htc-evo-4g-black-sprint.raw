Pros:. From my laptop, netbook, palm device to bluetooth devices....the Evo 4g is the best mobile investment I have made so far. It is amazing, fast and the apps are great! RDP and VNC apps, vpn support - rocks!. 
Cons:. It's not an Apple - haha! J/k. 

$$;
Pros:. Customisation, screen size, apps, battery life, fast processer. 
Cons:. Nothing at all. 
Summary:. Would highly recommend to anyone. I came from a pre and before that a motoq9c. My battery goes 18 hours plus, love all the apps, fast Internet, was easy setting up email, contacts, exchange server etc. Love it, constantly messing around with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, fast, fast. Great coverage (with Sprint mainly used in Colorado).. 
Cons:. Need more apps Android. 
Summary:. Easy to use, smooth running phone. Love the 1GHz processor. Awesome coverage with Sprint. Well worth the 10 dollar add-on to run (still cheaper than the other big 3 carriers).. 

$$;
Pros:. It does everything and it it does it well. Scree /Keyboard is big enough for my mitts to type accurately. 
Cons:. indoor and low light pictures are grainy;movies are not enough frames per second; plan to buy extra batteries and cords to keep you going. 
Summary:. If you wanted an iphone that comes with an all inclusive plan and does not drop calls, this is a great option. Outdoor pictures are very good, Indoor's I don;t know if you should even bother. Video is HD but not enough frames per second to rival my 3 year old Sony non HD video cam. Maybe the iphone has a better battery, maybe no one can afford the plan to run wifi, GPS, 3/4G, bluetooth, while multi tasking music/video streaming all running at the same time. I usuall forego the bells and whistles but decided to go for the evo because of the large screen. Yesterday, my son tells me we have to be at an event fin 15 minutes without directions, I literally just read the address into the GPS and made it on time with turn by turn directions in between the Pandora radio enterntainment. The device gives you a picture of the building as you are near the destination.. I can access my office computer with goto my pc like function and because of the screen size, it is actually usable.. The size is surprisingly not too big. The device still fits well in a shirt pocket and easily in one hand. My wife wants one and does not want anything smaller after seeing the evo.. Sprint tv is completely unnecssary, but never the less enjoyable when it is included with the package price. Android market has roughly the same aps as Iphone, so you can doanload lots of mindless games (for the kids of course) and other items pertinent to you business and liesure. Overall this thing could spoil you to the point that you may never tolerate boredom again, until your battery dies. When you compare specs there is little that can rival this thing, It is a pretty complete package for $150.. 

$$;
Pros:. So Much You Can Do with it. Too much to List !. 
Cons:. Took a long time with Sprint to tell me how to tether with it . I spoke to over a dozen reps before 1 rep could help me out . I even exchanged my 3 day old evo for a new 1, because they couldn't figure ot error 67 was ...... 
Summary:. I love my Evo !. 

$$;
Pros:. love the apps, screen is awesome, speaker is awesome, alarm is swesome, settings are awesome... it was all so good my wife got rid of her iphone and wet with the EVO... fun great phone, and I like the sprint service ans customer service... so far. 
Cons:. battery, battery, battery....... everything you hear about the battery is true. get losta chargers or upgrade battery. 
Summary:. love it, get it!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the HUGE screen on the phone, actually feels like im carrying something in my hand when I talk, Love the FAST processor and the Ability to Overclock it if you "Root" it, love that I can Customize almost any part of this Intelligent phone. 
Cons:. The 4G "Premium Data" that you have to pay regardless if your in a 4G area or not... Other than that.. must Say its an Iphone4 Killer. 
Summary:. Best phone for the Money, worth every last penny, Huge Android Community that expands everyday and has new developments every day as well, love how Google is the Backbone of it and allows its users to give them ideas for improved development.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the huge 4.3 inch screen, it makes texting and typing a lot easier. Also the spell check feature is a plus, awesome camera quality amazing service there are no internet browsers that I could not access so far. Loud speakers.. 
Cons:. There are so many awesome things to do and not enough battery so just buy a back up like me, I have had a few smart phones and honestly battery will always an issue so it would be wise to invest in a back up of some sort.. 
Summary:. Amazing phone, better than the HTC incredible by leaps and bounds, like I can stream, record and do so many things that i could not do on other phones. This phone allows me to be as social as I want no service interruptions and I could not be more happy like its that amazing. Guys I had a dream and the dream came true with HTC evo.. 

$$;
Pros:. 4G, the only (true) 4G except for Epic. (sorry T-mobile, HSPA+ is not fast enough) The phone is so nice in your hand, and its so customizable and user friendly. Video chatting! Live uploads to qik!. 
Cons:. Battery Life. No skype 3G/ 4G Video calling.... yet.. 
Summary:. Awesome phone! Resets the bar. Sprint 4G is just amazing! The only other competition is the Epic, and iPhone 4, and DroidX. Those are the only other phones that truly WOW you.. Updated. on Oct 21, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, smart, high quality, multifunctional. 
Cons:. Slightly heavy and big (but you get a great screen in return). 
Summary:. I didn?t think I was someone who would care to have a smart phone but the EVO won me over. I upgraded to this phone after trying the Samsung Intercept and not liking it at all. The EVO is a smart, smart phone. It is well thought out, intuitive and dynamic. It integrates the information from all of your accounts, Google, Facebook, Flicker, Twitter. Birthdays from Facebook show up on the calendar, contact information from various sources are linked and easily accessible. Typing is accurate and the words it suggests you may be typing are generally right on, even if I hit a wrong key and misspelled the word completely. On the web, pages are sized to fit the screen, so you don?t have to scroll side to side to read something on it!. The customization is great. You can make one of the 5 home screens a calculator, calendar, column of favorite contacts, music players, a stream of updates from all of your accounts, an RSS feed, the weather. The predicted weather forecast also show up on the bottom of a day you choose on the calendar! Each of these widgets for the home screen has various styles you can choose from, including full and partial page versions.. The Evo is fast, responsive, intuitive, sleek and fun. Having access to the web on the go has come in handy so many time already. Even though I like reading maps, having Sprint navigation and Google Latitude GPS system is really great. It helped me get to a work event in a town I wasn?t familiar with and was driving through down a highway on my own- so couldn?t safely read the map.. As for battery life, I?ve put on a home screen widgets to easily shut of 4G, GPS, Bluetooth and WiFi when I don?t need them and have been getting a full day of battery life out of it- though I haven?t tested it too hard yet.. Though generally a device trying to be many different devises in one is often not great at all of them, this phone is truly a phone, PDA, computer, camera, camcorder, radio, GPS, mp3 players, TV and handheld game system al in one. All in all, if you can afford the phone, and the $10 extra data charge, this phone is worth it!. I would check out monoprice.com for accessories like phone chargers and mini HDMI cords to hook the HD video camera up the computer. Their prices are amazing, they have quality products and great customer service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen size, almost perfect, i like the camera, fast with regular 3g, FASTER with 4g, cool applications, why it took them too long to make it.....nice reception, i call it the "SUPER PHONE"..GOOD JOB HTC..... 
Cons:. I hate the 10 bucks data MANDATORY CHARGE, the battery life is NOT that great, have to minimize the applications that use the battery energy to make it last longer,freezes sometimes for a microsecond... 
Summary:. I love this phone, easy to use, has many cool applications, runs fast , i like the screen size, nice overall phone size NOT TO BIG, NOT TO SMALL, JUST RIGHT ,after using the camera , makes my old CAMERA LOOK OLD AND FAR BEHIND.....the connection is good, the plan price is decent and customer service is great, I am so happy that I got me two evos, we order one black and one white, we got the black one in 10 days and the white one NEVER SHOWED UP so after 3 weeks we just canceled the white one and order the black one, we got it 3 days later......GREAT PHONE, BUY IT!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. everything. 
Cons:. battery life. 

$$;
Pros:. -Screen Size. -Cameras. -3G and 4G speed. -Consistent Software Updates. -Android Platform. -Multi-Tasking. -Video Chat. 
Cons:. -Battery Life could be better (I keep an extra battery around just in case, $5 on ebay). -$30 for hotspot (I did not buy that). 
Summary:. Having grown from 7 years of using the Palm OS platform and 3 years of using the Windows Mobile platform I decided to make the jump to an Android phone on Sprint. I have been a 10 year Sprint customer and I consider myself an early adopter when it comes to mobile technology. After seeing the direction Palm was heading while I had my Treo 700p I decided to switch over to Windows Mobile with the HTC Mogul (PPC-6800/Titan). I proceeded to buy the HTC Touch Pro and then the HTC Touch Pro 2 and saw that the Windows Mobile platform was losing creative and stability ground to Iphone and Android. Finding about how locked down the new Windows Phone 7 will be with no application backward compatibility, I decided to switch to Android and the HTC EVO. This has to be the ?perfect? Smartphone I have been looking for since my first one (Kyocera 6065-PalmOS) in 2001. The stability is second to none and I love the over the air software updates where I do not have to back up all my information and do it myself. I do not have any negatives to say about the phone other than the battery life could be better, but when you have a phone that can run 4G, GPS, Bluetooth, multitask, push email, text, stream music/TV, run full flash websites, stream internet radio/podcast, record in 720p and take pictures in 8 megapixels, video chat, etc. the battery life will run down. Seems to be the best phone on the market now due to Sprint?s superfast data network even without 4G, HTC?s hardware excellence, and the ever growing Android OS.. 

$$;
Pros:. too many list but the noticeable speed and ease of use. 
Cons:. battery life I can see being an issue but i bought a car charger and a charger as well at work and one thing a lot of people don't realize is when it does get down to the lower part of the battery it winds up lasting for a while because it conserves. 
Summary:. Can't believe how big of a technology gap this has over my palm pre that I had before this.. 

$$;
Pros:. Proud of it. 
Cons:. Wish there are never any. 
Summary:. Wifi and navigation is supergood. HTC is a classic smartphone that greatly combines a real smart phone and a PC. Personalized it to my style and proud of my choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the big screen the kick stand comes in handy i absolutely love the UI of the phone its easy to navigate and text on its also super fast for me not to be in 4g coverage. 
Cons:. There is nothing that i dont like i dont have a problem with my battery like alot of other people. 
Summary:. I had an htc touch pro 2 before this and decided to stick with htc because they make some good phones and its the best decision that i could have ever made i absolutely love my evo wouldnt trade it for any other phone. 

$$;
Pros:. The common responses are true: Screen size, multitasking capabilities, camera continues to impress, internet speed, Sprint specialty; best call quality. Coming from an individual who's purchased a countless number of phones, this phone rocks!. 
Cons:. The problem isn't necessarily the phone itself, it's the Android OS. I understand that the developers are always improving: Yes, but they need to filter out more often, the senseless, inappropriate applications on the marketplace. Only Con!. 
Summary:. I've been with all the Major carriers, and have experienced some of the best phones available, as a personal reviewer on what works well, and effective. I have to say that the Evo has me very impressed, I would recommend this personal pocket computer to anyone (Personal or Business) as it does have the Qualcomm Snapdragon, making it responsive at beautiful speeds for all tasks. With anyone who is upgrading from their previous phone and needs advice, look at all angles first and read reviews from honest, non-biased groups, like. . Good start by going onto Cnet ;). Make smart choices, with smart phones!. And Thank you Sprint!. 

$$;
Pros:. 8MP Camera. Tons of Apps. Frequent Updates. Big Android Community. Big Screen. Kick Stand. 
Cons:. Battery Life. Weak Wifi. Weak 4G. $10 extra. 
Summary:. This is my best phone yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sprint has very good plan prices.. Front Face Camera. Good Charger Location. Zoom and Align Text when clicked. 4G Network. Good Sound Quality. Sprint Navigator Free. Easy to find phone contacts. AutoFind when Searching for Application at Market. 
Cons:. Battery Life. No Camera Button like Droid. No Swype. No Skype. No pre-installed 16 GB Sim Card like Droid. 
Summary:. I've been with Verizon for so many years, and they have great customer service.. I've always heard about how Sprint Customer Service not so good.. I've tested heavily Verizon Droid X and Sprint EVO 4G to decide which one to choose for me and my wife.. They are VERY Identical. But for me, Sprint EVO 4G Won (10-9).. Below are the major 19 factor that are different that I care about (everything else matches):. 1- Cost for 2 years (EVO wins). 2- Front Face Camera (EVO Wins). 3- Battery Life (DROID Wins). 4- Camera Button (DROID Wins). 5- Good Charger Location (EVO Wins). 6- Customer Service and Network (DROID Wins). 7- Zoom and Align Text when clicked (EVO Wins). 8- Swype (DROID Wins). 9- Skype (DROID Wins). 10- Weight (DROID Wins). 11- 4G Network (EVO Wins). 12- Sound Quality (EVO Wins). 13- Speed Test at Home (DROID Wins). 14- Speed Test at Work (EVO Wins). 15- 16 GB Sim Card (DROID Wins). 16- Sprint Navigator Free/VZ Navigator Extra Charge (EVO Wins). 17- Banner Info Always on top (DROID Wins). 18- Easy to find phone contacts (EVO Wins). 19- AutoFind when Searching for Application at Market (EVO Wins). I've been with Sprint since the beginning of this month and so far, Sprint Customer Service is very good, I also heard that they've improved the last two-three years.. Good luck with your decision making.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has am amazing processor, still learning tons of the features that this phone has. one touch contact info, then 1 touch to call/text/email/share photo with. 4G is almost as fast as my home cable connection... ALMOST!. 
Cons:. Poor battery life, if you are updating apps, battery life is only about 3 hrs. normal use 6 hrs the batter is in the red. Facebook app works "boggs'' down the phone.. 
Summary:. Bottom line is the phone is an amazing device, basically a hand held computer. Facebook app slows down the phone had to actually shut down FB. It would spend hours to update (i have over 1200 friends), and the phone would actually get warm to touch, and then it would freeze. After shutting down FB the phone worked perfectly again. Works great with "exchange servers". Basically I would say this is the most perfect device that has ever been placed on the market. byebye iPhone Hello EVO. I run a real estate company off of it, work with my Masonic and Shriners Lodge info, updates calenders and so on and on and on... PERFECT&lt; but please give a stronger battery!!!!.

Pros:. Design, Fast processing, Sense UI, Connectivity, 4G speed, bright/clear 4.3 screen, quality 720p HD recording, HDMI, rear (8m)/front cameras, Wi-Fi, hot-spot, bluetooth, VPN works well, synch and exchange data easily, powerful browser, multi-tasking.. 
Cons:. No cons. Battery drains fast when you have such a powerful smartphone (a mini tablet PC with extras). Bought a back-up battery and other accessories online.. 
Summary:. Nice design, love the soft-touch material on its rear cover, fast processing power, 4.3 in screen (bright and clear at max when auto-balance is disabled), synch email, contacts works great, love the HTC Sense UI, 8m back and front facing cam for video conference, 720p hi-def video recording and hdmi out, great call and speaker quality, NO connectivity issues at all, love the google apps, VPN worked great for accessing my work's network, paired well with my Lenovo and Dell laptops and my car's bluetooth, easy to upload/download music, movies etc.. w/ PC organizes and plays mp3 very well. In conclusion, I can use this phone for work, multitasking, entertainment, multimedia, internet etc... Also, I am very happy with Sprint's network in my area.. 

$$;
Pros:. the power to do more then you ever imagined with a phone. internet browsing just beautiful on the giant 4.3 inch screen vibrant color HD camcorder capture the best video and picture HDMI to watch videos. Sense UI customization the android market.. 
Cons:. I found no cons even the battery great after 2 week your battery problem fade away and you start having a very good battery.. 
Summary:. bottom line I am a Iphone lover i have owned the iphone 3g 3gs and i have the iphone4 and ipad what i really love know that i have had the HTC EVO 4G for 2 month I must say the true no way any phone out in the market include my iphone4 could beet my new HTC EVO that it now I am waiting for HTC EVO 2.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like everything about this phone, but the color depth of the screen could be improved. Compared to the epic, it is a dream come true!. 
Cons:. I like everything about this phone, but the color depth of the screen could be improved. Compared to the epic, it is a dream come true!. 
Summary:. A great product, worthy of the name "smart phone".. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Cam, App Fring, 4G, Android Froyo. 
Cons:. The Batery..... 

$$;
Pros:. I love the size. I had the Hero before this phone and I found that one to be a little small for me. Easier for texting, easier to see the text. A very fast phone w/ the snapdragon processor. 8 megapixel camera, high def... awesome!. 
Cons:. It boasts the hdmi connectivity to your tv, but doesnt include the cable. I found one on ebay for 6 bucks. So if others are selling em that cheap brand new, why doesn't HTC just include one in the box? Power buttons a little hard to find sometimes.. 
Summary:. Really, the good FAR outways the bad. Easily the best phone I've ever owed. Easy to use, with features that are too numerous to begin to mention here. Can't wait to be able to utilize the 4G. They need to get that out to far more areas than what's available right now. But, it'll come. One thing though, don't listen too much to all the hype on iphone and all that Apple crap. I own an itouch and have used plenty of Apple products...they have plenty of flaws. I've had them freeze up and not work properly too. So, don't think their product is impervious to gliches. I will say this though, I've not had one thing freak out on my Evo since I've had it. And it's going on 3 weeks. I love this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's everything that I ever wanted, thought of or did not even thought possible that a phone should be.. 
Cons:. Battery life. 
Summary:. Best phone hardware ever, plus being an Android phone, it is an amazing combination. Better than any iPhone and the Sprint radio frequency is better than any other carrier at penetrating buildings. This in itself is another point, what good is a carrier that you have to be outside always to have signal?. 

$$;
Pros:. Android 2.2, 4.3" screen, fast performance, 8 megapixel rear camera, front facing camera, good WiFi (a/b/g/n) performance, excellent GPS performance. excellent touch calibration. I can't think of anything more that one would want in a mobile phone.. 
Cons:. Wish it came with the Swype keyboard.. 
Summary:. I've owned a Nokia N97, Samsung Vibrant, Nexus One and numerous other mobile phones and none of them has offered the reliability of the HTC EVO. I have to say that the 4.3" screen has grown on me so much that I don't think I will ever go back to less than 4.3". Reading on the device and using applications from the Android Market are a delight on the 4.3" screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. FAST, great voice quality, awesome camera, huge screen, slips easily in and out of jeans. 
Cons:. Slightly too big, battery life could be a tad better. 
Summary:. It's fast, very fast. It arrived running Android 2.2 and I'm not noticing the terrible battery life some have mentioned. I make it through the whole day on a charge without a problem. It feels good in the hand, and yes it does slip easily and out of my jeans. I miss Synergy on my Pre and simple syncing from my iPhone, but I love this phone. Great sound quality, no dropped calls, it is REALLY fast unlike my pokey Pre, camera is excellent, cheap Sprint calling plans, and hold on to your hats...I really have had great experiences with Sprint customer service. I'm very happy.. Updated. on Oct 29, 2010.

$$;
Pros:. Huge 4.3" make navigating and everything else a little bit more fun and easier to use. Sprint has great coverage in my area. It's not an iPhone.. 
Cons:. My back cover isn't smooth out and had a little bump. 4G is not that strong where I live (GP, TX) but I do have signal.. 
Summary:. I root my phone with Cyanogenmod and I like this phone even more. It gave me so much freedom to change the phone the way I wanted to. I.

Cons:. Not having it since first day. Every time I went to the stores they said: Sold out!. (Until Best Buy made me happy in 070310 yeah!!!). 
Summary:. Best smart-phone I ever seen and had (still have it lol). I swear.. I've been using computers for more than a decade and this close to one + the phone. I have peace of mind knowing I can do everything I need. I can't picture myself without this "mini computer" with both cameras, the kickstand + all its specs..

Pros:. su pantalla su procesador el sistema operativo la red de sprint que funciona muy rapido y vien con evo. 
Cons:. bueno la bateria creo que quiere una mas potente. 
Summary:. bueno su soporte de flash para reproducir videos en la web algo en ningun telefono hasta ahora nisiquiera en el iphone4 pobre verdad pero bueno creo que despues de la bateria no tiene contras. 

$$;
Pros:. Large and vibrant screen. Fully customizable. Android Sense and Froyo make a great UI experience. Form Factor - Feels nice in the hand. 
Cons:. Battery life is not the best. You will either have to get an extended battery or constantly monitor applications and radio dials to preserve battery life.. 
Summary:. This is one of the bst phones I have ever used. It would take a full page or more to list all it can do. I have only owned it for about 2 weeks and I know I've only scracthed the surface of its capabilities. At one time I used to cast longing looks toward iphone users but no more. The only downside is because it can do so much the battery life is not the best. With the recent froyo update the battery has improved but to really be able to use this phone all day without monitoring what you have turned on or off you will need an extended battery and this of course will affect the form factor. My wife was the first person to upgrade to an evo so I bought her a seidio 3500mah extended life battery. This battery was extremely powerful and can go for almost 48 hours (that's right I said 48 hours) without needing to be recharged. Of course using a battery like this will also require a change for the back of your battery and then it will feel different in your hand. So that is the downside but otherwise it is a great product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great display with fantastic resolution; fast microprocessor; fast downloads; Android Navigation rocks; no issues with battery life; works fast on 3G and 4G networks; Internet is almost as fast as Cox's cable's home service..

Cons:. none so far after 2 weeks of heavy use.. 
Summary:. it can't get better this is the best technology no wonder why i dropped my iPhone 3gs and did not upgrade to the iPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size. I DO use it as a multi media device to watch TV and videos while on breaks and lunch. It feels strudy. The kickstand is a top idea.. 
Cons:. Battery life could be better, the should have used at least a 2000mAh battery.. 
Summary:. Android is the new king and the EVO is the chariot to take it to the top.. 

$$;
Pros:. Switched from Touch Pro 2 to HTC Hero to HTC Evo 4G. Super fast processing speed. With 4.3 inch screen watching youtube, mobile TV, browsing the web is totally amazing. Speech to Text. Micro HDMI. and Best of ALL the Color is Black with Red accent!. 
Cons:. The phone is big, but the speech to text definitely help. the phone build quality is good. but many users, including myself notice the "Light Leakage" on the bottom of your screen, a less than half of mm crack that causes the light to shine out.. 
Summary:. I love this phone, i enjoy the Android platform. Suppose All window users to make the switch. and all Iphone User to enjoy something different. Google did a awesome job with the Android Market. People complain about the battery life. yes the bigger screen did cause this particular phone to drain battery faster than small phones out there. but know what to do to save the battery usage is a must for any HTC Evo users. Shut down Features when they are not in use. Turn off/change settings on luxuries such as Vibrate on incoming calls, Haptic Feedbacks, Animations, Brightness (auto or 30% light), Screen Time out. once these options are turned off or changed. your are good to go with a minimum of 4-6 hours above normal usage on this bad boy. Hope everyone with HTC Evo Enjoy this awesome phone, and All other Users try this phone out!. Updated. on Sep 13, 2010.

Pros:. Droid system, 8mp camera, HD video camera, huge 4.3 inch screen, kickstand, 4g capable, charges incredibly fast, dual flash, incredibly accurate touchscreen, blazingly fast internet, one touch gps, wifi, bluetooth and 4G.... 
Cons:. The battery could be better but this one charges so fast and there isn't a phone with a better battery out there anyway. 4G could be better too but no other network has 4g yet and I'm in a wifi spot most of the time.. 
Summary:. I had the iphone 4 and switched to the Evo 4G 2 weeks later. Iphone has a 5mp cam... Evo has 8. Iphone has 3.4 inch screen... Evo has 4.3. Iphone has no default GPS and they recommend you buy one for 50 bucks... Evo has an amazing one that is not only free but linked to google search so you can instantly navigate to your google search results. You have to type everything with Iphone... Evo has talk to search, talk to type and talk to txt all included and its incredibly accurate. Iphone has a much much slower internet browser. The iphone drops my calls sometimes when my fingers are over the antenna even with the 30 dollar bumper i bought. The customization with the Evo via droid is so much better than Iphone. I have never paid for an app yet about 90% of the Droid apps are free, where Iphone a lot of them cost money especially if you want the "full" version. Iphone you have to cancel each app that runs in the background... Evo has several app killers that do it all at once. Although the network is small still Evo has 4G capability whereas Iphone is stuck on 3G only. It's nice to know technology will have to catch up with my phone. In the past I would get a new phone because my old one was outdated... this seems like the reverse. Oh and the Iphone 4 webcam can only be used to talk to other iphone 4's in a wifi spot. The evo's webcam can talk to anyone via skype etc on any webcam anywhere you get 3g.. In short the Evo is by far the best phone on the market today. I looked at the droid x for verizon which looks similar to the evo but no webcam and no 4g among other things. Through the years I would get a phone based on imporvements i wished it had and then get the phone that most closely met those desired improvements. With the Evo 4G I have no improvements i would want except maybe a better 4g network which not only will come but no other network even has 4G yet and I'm often in a Wifi spot so that doesn't really matter at this point anyway. Besides that it's a perfect phone!. Updated. on Aug 4, 2010.

Summary:. I was with Palm for 5 years and finally switched over to Android. I'm glad I did. This phone is simply amazing. It has more features than any phone currently on the market. The Android app store is awesome with over 35,000 apps on top of the phone. The phone is fully customizable. Battery life isn't amazing but is good for a smartphone and can be greatly improved with a few changes in the menu. The Sprint network is great and is way better than AT&#38;T incase you are comparing phones. Very satisfied overall.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wonderful performance overall, Hotspot feature, Clean HTC Interface, Customization options, Camera quality, Video recording, Kickstand convenience, Glass touch screen, loud speaker, Bright screen, Very little to no lag, Battery life. 
Cons:. External buttons are incorrect size and placement for large phone, Battery door flimsy, Not shipping with 2.2 OS, 720P video recording is pixelated, No BT voice dialing, On-screen keyboard is lackluster and no auto space,. 
Summary:. I don't live in a 4G area so I did not test this so far. The battery life is surprisingly good and lasts all day for me despite some early complaints about the battery dying too quickly.. I must say that I am thoroughly impressed with the EVO and it has changed my mind about Android based phones overnight. This is my first HTC Android phone and I enjoy their Sense UI over stock Android UI. With the impending 2.2 update coming this week, the EVO (and Droid X for Verizon) is the best of what Android has yet and I am delighted with this Smartphone.. Updated. on Sep 21, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Video Calling is great, Beautiful Screen Resolution, Android 2.2 coming 08/03/10, Kickstand, Thanks god this phone is not with at&#38;t, 4G data speeds are off to a good start and will improve, App Count on Marketplace is on pace with the iOS App Store. 
Cons:. Sprint future transition of 4G from WiMax to LTE , 4G speeds need to improve (wifi over my home's internet is faster), Device availability shortage such that customer needs to get on a waiting list, Voice Dial over BT missing until Froyo gets here. 
Summary:. I switched back to Sprint from AT&#38;T at the end of March 2010 and initially got the HTC Hero for both mine as well as the wife's line. I sold my HTC Hero on eBay that I initially started my Sprint Service with and got a White one back on 7/09/2010. It's an awesome phone with all you could possibly imagine and everything I've wanted in a mobile device.. Pros:. - 1 GHz Processor. - Sprint TV has excellent reception. - Fast 3G Speeds as well as 4G. - Camera takes excellent quality shots, both still photos (8MP Main and 1 MP Front Camera) as well as Video (720p). And are you kidding me? Face-Time on wifi only on iPhone 4? We can video chat on 3g, 4g and wifi iZombies!. - Kickstand is a good add on Useful when taking a call over speaker or watching a video on this device. - HTC's expeditious handling to release patches for immediately detected defects with this device. (i.e., defect with the Expandable Storage which was addressed by the end of the weekend and then the battery life and WiFi Connectivity.).. - The Market Place offers more apps for Android on the higher end devices and many are great over 4G. 55k - 65k and counting (Lookout Apple, we're gonna take you down! Didn't Apple's App Store have that many or may just slightly more when their iOS was only 2 years old?). - Android phones will get Android 2.2 (i.e., Froyo) very soon. No more storage setbacks compared to iPhone.. - Wifi Mobile Hotspot is a nice add on to this device. Monthly subscription &lt; than that on Mi-Fi or Overdrive.. - Screen Resolution is impressive, second probably to the up and coming Epic 4G coming later in August 2010.. -Live Wallpapers are really nice. -Google Maps with Voice Navigation is the way to go. I've stopped using my Garmin for this purpose as the maps on Google Maps are more up to date.. Cons:. - Concerned about Sprint's 4G transition WiMax to LTE, which is potentially going to happen in the next 2 years. Sprint Techs have said though that a firmware patch OTA would resolve this connectivity concern.. - My wifi connection at home over FiOs (25 mbps down/25 mbps up) is faster than 4G (3-6 mbps down with occasional 10 mbps spikes/1-2 mbps up). Boost the speed.. - Sprint Corp Store &#38; Radio Shack still working a wait list.. - No Voice Dial over Bluetooth until the arrival of Android 2.2 (FroYo) on 08/03/2010. I'm so glad though that the Evo is only the 2nd device to the Nexus One to "officially" get Froyo release for it. I'm so waiting for it!. Don't wait! Get on a wait list at your local Best Buy, Radio Shack or Sprint Store and get one today!. Updated. on Aug 5, 2010.

$$;
Pros:. everything. 
Cons:. I had to downlod a couple of power management apps now the battery life is about the same as my iphone. 
Summary:. Well everyone is coming out with 4g if your phone doesn't have it you have to buy a new one so the evo is good there. The hotspot works really good. The overall operatioon of this phone is awsome. It just works. The big screen makes it so much better to use and see. I've been testing all the new ones and this one is hands down the winner. Just try it for a while you'll never go back.. 

$$;
Pros:. Much better looking than any phone out there (sleeker than the Droid X, iphone). gorgeous screen. minimilist design with the kitchen sink inside. cheapest plan. thin. fully customizable. replaceable battery. can replace a netbook and easily better than iPad. 
Cons:. battery life. back cover is weak.

$$;
Pros:. It's just fun. The screen size, the smooth operation of apps, large keyboard space, cameras and I like Sense over the OS. 
Cons:. I just want more accessories.. a specific car mount and I do wish the stand would work in Vertical- and that it had been placed in the middle.... 
Summary:. The EVO just works so well on so many levels. I have my nook for dedicated ebook reader but the EVO is so portable and takes great pictures- great as music player, video in daylight and an awesome browser that even plays some flash already prior to Foyo- I now use it in place of so many other gadgets.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything this amazing phone does, it does fast and flawlessly !. 
Cons:. NONE ! Some are saying the size is a negative, but this is part of the attraction.. $10 extra fee? no problem....still worth it!. 
Summary:. The Evo does it all ! I swithched from a heavily Tweeked PalmPre to the EVO 1 month ago....an AMAZING machine. I have not touched my Laptop for 4 weeks now....dont really need it with this phone around.. I will reccommend that anyone wanting a superior phone.....BUY THIS ONE !!. 

$$;
Pros:. everything about this phone is great!. 
Cons:. The battery life could be better. 
Summary:. Best phone on the market, and sprint has the best data plan. 

$$;
Pros:. Blazing speed. ANDROID!! You can "root" the phone to get free wifi hotspot and bypass Sprint's costly $30/mo. hotspot feature. Big, gorgeous display (different from iPhone's "retina" display, but just as nice IMO). I have 4G, which is FAST.. 
Cons:. Battery drains pretty quickly, but, unlike the iPhone's battery, it's removable, so at worst, you can buy a spare OEM battery for $30 on amazon (not ideal, but the perks of this amazing phone make it worth it). The HD video could look better.. 
Summary:. My wife and I traded in our iPhone 4's for Evo's and WE HAVEN'T LOOKED BACK.. Once we started using the Evo, we realized that so much of the iPhone's appeal is asthetic. This phone is a workhorse, and it outperforms the i4 in nearly every category. ...and while it may not be as sexy as Apple's baby, it looks great in its own right (and you can hold it any way you please).. If you haven't used Android yet, you're missing out. In my opinion, it offers all the perks of iPhone's iOS, but with soooo much more (Android's much more open, whereas Apple has their "walled garden" method of only allowing what's most convenient for them. It offers more possibility out of the box, and you get the sense that it's infinitely more upgradeable than iPhone. Android is here to stay, and the Evo announces that with the voice of a giant.. I'm much more tech-friendly and I love this phone; yet my wife is only casually familiar with tech, and she loves it as well. I HIGHLY recommend the Evo. Spring $30 for an extra OEM battery and the only drawback will be null and void.. Updated. on Jul 23, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. quality of the phone, the apps, the large touch screen,. 
Cons:. battery life is challenging. 
Summary:. had always been a blackberry person (a very non-intuitive phone) so the switch to the EVO was not only easy but made me realize how hard it was to learn the blackberry while how simple the EVO is.. no need to repeat the things people have raved about i other reviews -- i think this phone is just awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen is important for email management; HTC and Sprint has worked out an excellent user interface. Also in my area cell towers are few and far between, the Sprint Airave is the best for giving me all five bars all the time in my office.. 
Cons:. It might take years before 4G is available in my distrinct, but it is worth it even without 4G since all the other features are superb.. 

$$;
Pros:. Call quality, display, processor speed. 
Cons:. $10 fee; easy to make mistakes on keyboard; battery life; 4G may have to be turned off, then back on to acquire 4G signal.. 
Summary:. First, let me say - I love the phone. I am thrilled with my decision to retire my BlackBerry Curve 8330. I cannot imagine going back to the BlackBerry after having this phone.. To me the most important thing about a phone is, surprise, the call quality. I think we tend to get caught up in features (bells and whistles), and we lose sight of the fact that you actually have phones to make calls. Sprint's service is much improved over the years, and I have found that drops, echoes, being able to hear the other person clearly but he/she can't hear you at all - those things are few and far between. Noise cancellation is very good, and you can't hear yourself of anything on your end when talking. I have roamed off of Sprint's network a couple of times, and you would never know.. The display is, well, large. The phone is the size of a 4.3" GPS. It is a big phone, particularly compared to my old BlackBerry. Not a really big deal though. I can still fit it in my pocket, and it doesn't look like you have a banana in your pocket (or "you're happy to see" someone). The colors are sharp, bright, and beautiful. Taking pictures, video, or viewing websites all look breathtaking. I have taken 720p video and sent it to YouTube to see online, and it is HD quality. Pictures are 8MP, and they look just as good as a regular consumer's digital camera. As is the case with most phones, you can obviously zoom from picture to picture, but you can't zoom during video shooting. Zoom is not that great in either case, but who cares? You don't buy a phone for what a camera is supposed to do.. The ability to switch from screen to screen, web page to webpage, what have you is amazing. The snapdragon processor is remarkable. My understanding is that this is why they are nailing you for the extra $10/month. Whatever. Either way, the phone moves very smoothly from calls to texts to web to apps.. Speaking of apps, I am new to the Android Market, and I have found its selection comparable to the Apple App world. Anything that I've needed for the Evo, it's in the Android Market. I allow my daughter to play with the Evo every once in a while, and there is more than enough to entertain her.. Wi-fi - for me, it's a necessity. I do not live in a 4G neighborhood. It kicks in about 10 miles south of where I live. I frequent that area quite a bit; so it wasn't completely nonsensical for me to get a 4G phone. That said, my wi-fi at home more than fills in the gap for when I can't get the 4G. Should I not be in a 4G area or not with wi-fi, the 3G is amazingly quick too. I have been going download speeds at close to 1 mbps on 3G, 4.5 mbps on 4G, and my wi-fi is close to 6 mbps. Speed on the web will NOT be an issue on this phone even on 3G. 3G on this phone compared to the BlackBerry is night and day - please don't think that you're not going to be upgrading if you don't get into a 4G area as the 3G on here is far faster.. The music app is very iPod like. While the iPod is the gold standard, you aren't losing much on the Evo. It has become my iPod when I'm at the pool, exercising, etc.. Now for the things, I'm not crazy about.... I have an iPod Touch that I type on every once in a while - again, when I'm on wi-fi. I find my accuracy in typing on the iPod far better than my accuracy on the Evo. Now, that may be a "me" problem. Your results may be better. I find myself making a zillion mistakes on the Evo. The dictionary on the Evo is really deep, and most common words are in there. I get a little frustrated sometimes texting or emailing from the phone because I find that I'm just not really good with the keyboard yet. Hopefully, that will improve.. Battery life: if you leave the brightness on "automatic brightness," you will not make it through a day with this phone if you are a "power user." Just not going to happen. I have found a couple of work-arounds: (1) lower the brightness to as far left as you can handle it. I have been pleasantly surprised that going lower on the brightness has not been a big deal at all. Now, if I'm outside in bright sunlight, of course, I can run the brightness back to "automatic." But, if I get in my car or go inside, lowering it is not a biggie at all. (2) install an app called "Advanced Task Killer Free." For some reason, apps tend to mysteriously come on in the background and stay on (even though you'd never know). This app can be set to close those apps automatically, obviously saving battery life. With those things in place, I have been fine with the battery life. I was scared to death when I first got the phone that I would have to take it back because of the lack of battery life, but I'm OK now.. Lastly, 4G is really cool - when the phone recognizes I'm in a 4G area. Sometimes, I know I'm in a 4G area, and I have to cut the 4G off and turn it back on for the phone to pick it up. Not sure if that's a flaw or, again, a "me" problem.. Hope this helps! Enjoy!. 

$$;
Pros:. It does everthing well; Sprint $69 all inclusive package is the best deal period. EVO vs. iPhone 4: Its bigger, has a better network, fast built-in hot-spot, more features, 8 gig HDcam, has 4G, cheaper &#38; better plan. etc. iPhone 4 users r switching!. 
Cons:. Ear piece area gets hot. Battery life is not that great when using wi-fi and other apps but there are ways and programs to work around or fix that issue.. 
Summary:. It is ahead of the curve period!!! Even if you dont live in a 4G area it will smoke any other 3G phone. It's simply at the head of the class in smart phones. I left Verizon and I could not be happier; Sprint is competive; give you more for your money and is will to absorb/credit up to $150.00 of your early temination fee. It was too easy to switch. I now have the best smart phone on earth on one of the best networks, and with 4G capability. There is a $10 premium on the EVO 4G due to it 4G and faster 3Gccapability (worth it) you will more than make it up with the $69.00 unlimited all inclusive plan. The only thing that is limited is 450 anytime "land-line minutes" but even that is free from 7PM to &#38;AM. Verizon cost more (with an employee discount) and anytime starts at 9PM (irked me). For $69.00 Sprint gives you: Unlimited cel to cell; unlimited texting &#38; picture mail; free unlimited data plan, free GPS. I had the $69 plan with Verizon and got way less and more restrictions; I also had a separate $60 per month data plan for my netbook. Well I only pay $30 for my Built-in Hotspot that will host up to 8 wireless divices. That alone is saving me $30 per month. I could go on &#38; on but I am still learning what all my HTC EVO 4G "CAN DO!!!" And I lived happily ever after!!!. Updated. on Jul 17, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. 8mp camera, video conference per wifi, 3g, 4g and so on.can overclock this phone to 1.25 processor. thats sick !!!! unlimited memory, free wifi hotspot if rooted or use pda/net there is so much to do on this device your imagination is the only limit. 
Cons:. battery if you dont know what to turn off, or you could root this phone and then you would have no problems at all. 
Summary:. perfect device for those intelligently looking for something better than apples power trip on buyers. 

$$;
Pros:. huge screen, fast, responsive, customizable, Sense UI, MS exchange, solid, sleek. 
Cons:. Slightly heavier than I'd like, wish the CNN app from iPhone was as nice on Android. 
Summary:. I wasn't able to get the iPhone 4 on launch day, then when reports of antenna troubles emerged- I decided to go eloping with Verizon and Sprint. I spent a week with the Droid and loved the tactile keyboard, but was wishing I had a 1ghz phone. I got my hands on the EVO from Sprint and couldn't be happier. The data plans are cheaper, and with free roaming- I not only get Spint coverage-- but Verizon, AT&#38;T, T-mobile too.. Some people dislike the HTC Sense UI, but I think it's gorgeous and a welcome change from the boring iPhone interface. It's so customizable that you'll spend the first two days looking for wallpapers, widgets, launchers, etc.... Syncs up perfectly with MS Exchange and I find that HTC's e-mail interface is much nicer than Apple's and has a lot more functions (sort by unread, sort by conversation, sort by attachments, etc...). My contacts and calendar sync perfectly with MS Exchange and the calendar is much nicer than Apple's too.. Syncs my Facebook contacts right into the phone- and adds information and pictures to existing names.. Notification bar is super handy- especially when you have your phone on silent and don't want to check it every 10 seconds to see if 'that e-mail you're waiting for' came in. Discreet green led light flashes when you get a new text or e-mail.. Multi-tasking is excellent. I learned that you have to use the 'back' button when exiting out of each program instead of the home button (like iPhone). If you just hit the home button, the program will continue running in the background and pretty soon you'll start draining the battery. There's another setting-- I can't remember if setting the preferred network to Sprint or disabling one of the roaming options fixes the short battery life problem. I'm able to have my 7 screens full of widgets, keep push e-mail on, surf the web, text, talk, etc... and still have battery at the end of the day.. Apps are great-- some are even better than the versions from iTunes. Clock, stocks, calculator, etc... are all a cut above the iPhone. Documents open up perfectly. Camera takes great pics. Phone is blazing fast. The kickstand is great for carrying on conversations without needing to hold the phone. Front-facing camera just like iPhone 4.. This phone is a beast-- for anyone sitting on the fence about renewing your contract with AT&#38;T- I'd suggest you try out Verizon or Sprint. You get a 30-day return period to try out their network and phones. Google has really surpassed the competition with Android. Any of the phones with HTC Sense UI will blow you away-- lots of eye-candy and functionality. Motorola's Motoblur and the 'naked' Android interface are ok (but will need a lot more customization to give them glamour).. I also love that i can set any song that I want to be my ringtone. I download music from Amazon's MP3 store (just like iTunes) but the difference is I can play on ANY computer without Apple's permission.. Give the EVO a spin- it's worth taking a break from Apple to see what their competition is doing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, responsive, excellent gps (turn by turn), great call quality, wonderful notification system, sleek, sexy, great speaker, overall it is just a great phone.. 
Cons:. Trying to find one that doesn't have any flaws (i.e., screen separation, dead pixel, and missing SD card).. 
Summary:. Bottom line this phone is great and you just have to own one to know what I am talking about. Coming from the iphone, Android took some time getting used to. Once I got the swing of things I couldn't have been happier jumping ship. Sprint has great coverage in my area, which means I finally have a multimedia powerhouse that can serve its original function, to make and receive phone calls (Thank you HTC and Sprint!!!!).. While I think this phone is way better than the iphone there is only one draw back to me, which was finding a phone that is in great condition out of the box. I went through three phones before I found the love of my life, lol. I had one that was missing an SD card (returned), the next had a dead pixel (returned), the next had slight screen separation (returned), and finally I got a good one. I give it five stars because if you can get one that is in good coming out of the box you have a gem. Come on Sprint and HTC you have seriously got to make sure what you ship out is on point before you ship it out, but I guess that is the common theme this month for cell phones (i.e., htc evo, iphone 4, htc incredible). Call it my bad luck or whatever you want to call it, if you can get this phone and it is truly mint out of the box you will not be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. HD, 2. Speed, 3. more than apps one at a time, 4. wi-fi 5. ergonomic. 
Cons:. 4G not everywhere. 
Summary:. I luv Sprint. Prices, coverage and it's always the other guy dropping the calls.. Now they have a REAL smartphone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unlimited data for hotspot, Hotspot can work on 4g and 3g up to 8 devices, kickstand for video chat and watch TV plus Movies, Don't have to be on wifi for video chat, Monthly fees, customize however you want. 
Cons:. Haven't found any yet and I've had it since day of launch.. 
Summary:. I can't even explain how great this phone is. I have used almost every phone...at least the high end ones and this is just some else. After having and Evo it just feels perfect. I love the feel in my hand and love the beautiful screen for searching the web and so on. If anyone has anything bad to say about this its the battery life and some say the size may be too big. I will say number one that the size is not too big at all. Not even close. Just feels....like I said before perfect. Everything after using it just feels crammed and feels like your missing out on a great experience. Slides right into your pocket. Better than most phones slide into a pocket. Number two, battery life is very misleading. There are sights out there that do say the battery live isn't bad and it gets just as good as most phones. Than there are the ones that say its very poor battery live which is very much a lie. I would say most of the people that say that dont know how to use the device and another thing is to some people it may seem that way because with this phone you will want to play with it all day so your on it much longer than you would of been on a other device. Even so I get on average about 11 12 hours of battery life out of it before I charge it. Thats using it much more than normal use. After using this the iphone just feels...well boring. You can customize everything. Not to mention how good monthly fees are. Unlimited data for hotspot up to 8 devices as well. Every other phone just feels so restricted. And who wants to video chat only on wifi and having to hold there phone up the whole time. Kickstand really is a very nice feature. Bottom line is it is an amazing phone and you wont be disappointed..

Pros:. Great Applications,. 
Cons:. Battery Life is very week.. 
Summary:. I would and do recommend this phone, but get a extra power cord for work..

Pros:. EASE OF USE IS SO AWESOME. FAST DOWN LOAD SPEEDS, THIS PHONE KEEPS ME FROM CARRYING A LOT OF EQUIPMENT. TOP OF THE LINE FEATURES. THIS PHONE IS SO GREAT POSTING MY REVIEW EVERYWHERE. 
Cons:. THE GOOD OUT WEIGHS THE BAD.. 
Summary:. Yes I can complain about battery life, but thats with every phone i have ever had. I love this phone so much I sleep with it, wake up in the middle to play with it. It was love at first sight.. My last few phones was a Mogul the Touch Pro, then Touch Pro 2. I Loved each phone until the next one came out.. Every feature that was important to me has been made easier to manuever on the evo 4 The way I can manage text messages and visual voice mail is awesome. From deletion to locking message. Same with email. Screen is so enjoyable to watch you tube, which I use to research anything at the drop of a dime.Internet speeds are fast especially opening up a attachment,. The fact that I can use my rhapsody subcription on this has made it an instant. Mp3 player which I use with my stereo wireless headset or through my car speaker, ..sounds and plays great with EASE OF USE!. I am a real estate agent, camera and camcorder is all I need to post a house... emailing pictures is a PIECE OF CAKE., and they are so clear. Video phone is great to give an online tour via QIK.COM... The phone is also used to enter homes via lockbox. So I dont need a camera anymore, a lockbox key, a GPS, Mp3 player and my small notebook computer. Oh dont let me forget the data card which always needed to be replaced for $100.00 a pop. Hot Spot will take care of that.. the feature I like the most is that I can send the caller who left a voice mail a message back to their voice mail without speaking to them. Slydial is missing me.. the games are awesome and I am 58 years young Take your time learning the phone, before you dog it out. I Learn something every day. At first I thought I was going to send it back because I was not use to the Android system. Watch every video and read forums. You will learn something everyday.. Sprint you can offer me a job I will answer any questions on how to operate this phone. I can do commercials for you and sell more phones than best buys or radio shack. I LOVE THE EVO. and stood on line to get it ( a 1st) (and last). I was reluctant about signing a 2 year contract, but this phone is worth it. and I havent even set up my hot spot.nor my sling back to watch my DVR on the phone via a computer with the proper cord.. Sprint I am proud of you for this one. Plus your customer service has even gotten a little bit better. Hope these two years is not painful.

Pros:. screen size, clarity, processing speed, ease of use, applications, look, feel, responsivness..

Pros:. Sprint plan is so much better for me.. I pay $83.27 for none stop text, web, and mobile calling. (I get a nice discount). The screen is super nice.. The speed is outstanding.. The camera is nice.. The kickstand is a nice touch.. And tons of other features.. 
Cons:. The speaker phone sucks!!. 
Summary:. With today's technology it is hard to expect the battery to last all day.. The screen is big and bright which means the phone is going to use a lot of power.. I'm happy with the advancements we have made thous for and looking forward to the next BIG DEAL.. I don't upgrade my phones very often so this was a big upgrade for me.. You have 30 days to try it out so I would tell everyone to try and see if the Evo is your cup of tea..

Pros:. The first thing that I noticed switching from the iPhone was the "openness" of the device. I can change backgrounds, add widgets, each app is customizable, anything can be a ringtone. It is sturdy, beautiful, fast, "it just works," 4G is amazing.. 
Cons:. Video calling app needs some work (not a fault of the phone). Periods are entered in text/email composing so the keyboard (while great) has been a pain in this area. Hard to find many legitimate cons with this device.. 
Summary:. I just wrapped my iPhone 3G in a box and sent it to my mom. Goodbye iPhone. I am so glad I stepped out of the flock and looked into other devices. What a refreshing change. The device's flexibility and tailorability for me is huge. Camera is amazing. I also appreciate the social network integration and how seamless the HTC sense/Android experience truly is. A GREAT DEVICE on what appears so far to be a GREAT NETWORK.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast-Outlook Compatible-HTC interface is very user friendly.. 
Cons:. Have yet to find any.. 
Summary:. I've owned and tried many phones but this is by far the best smart-phone I've ever experienced.. 

$$;
Pros:. every little thing about this phone.. 
Cons:. none i dont see anything cons about this phone. 
Summary:. the best phone you will love this phone.amazing. 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous screen, 8 megapixel back camera, front facing camera, HTC Sense, very fast, 4G.. 
Cons:. $10 mandatory fee.. 
Summary:. This is by far the best phone yet to be made.. I don't imagine myself looking again into the IPhone.. This phone has broken the limits of what a phone is supposed to do and being that true I cant wait to see in the future an EVO II or something like that! (only later my wife realized that it rhymes but it was not my intention LOL). 

$$;
Pros:. +Customizable. +Pretty much everything. 
Cons:. -Battery lfie. 
Summary:. The phone is great all around. The only negative is the battery life. You can get good battery life if you use it for texting and calling, but if you are constantly surfing the web, downloading stuff, etc it will drain quickly. Expect 6-8 hours of battery life if you are constantly using browsing the internet or streaming music. The phone itself has everything and i mean EVERYTHING I could wish for in a phone and more. This phone is incredibly fast! I have actually almost ceased to use my laptop because I can simply use the phone for just about everything besides research papers. Overall, I'm extremely happy with the phone and couldn't ask for much more in a cell phone.. Updated. on Jul 15, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen, Android, the camera, the kickstand.. 
Cons:. Battery Life.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of pros...screen size is great and LCD looks great even though its not AMOLED screen, fast and responsive, kickstand, 8mp camera works great (i have taken lots of pics on 2 different trips and they turned out great)...lots more!. 
Cons:. Battery life is not the best. I have found that with the over the air update and with time the battery life has improved. I can now go all day without charging.. 
Summary:. Best smart phone out there and is just as good as the iphone if not better...the only thing the iphone has on the EVO is the number of apps which Android is doing a good job of releasing more.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large Screen- great for typing, viewing web pages, and watching videos.. Kickstand- I use it all the time to view videos and scroll through webpages.. Camera- I use my phone as my point and shoot and video camera and have no complaints.. 
Cons:. Android takes a little bit of effort to learn. It is not as easy as iOS, but is more customizable. I have had the hardest time trying to easily download a feature movie to my phone. It was easy to go to iTunes by a movie an then load up to 3gs.. 
Summary:. Overall best phone on the market. Totally pocketable and not as large as some blogs make it to be. I live in Portland that has 4g and it works great. However, this would still be one of the best phones if you only use 3g. I highly recommend the EVO 4G.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone is really a great device, perfect size and weight, blazing fast, an all around great PBA.. 
Cons:. Battery life is short (as expected) but you can get the 1800MAH battery for it and works great!. 
Summary:. This phone is really a great device, its actually a lot more than a phone. I was starting to think that no-one would ever be able to beat the Apple I phone, we'll HTC and Sprint finally did! For years I was stuck with lousy ATT service (and I live in NYC) just to have the I phone. Now I have a much better product on the carrier of my choice, Sprint. Great phone, awesome plan, looking forward to the next version of the EVO in a year or 2!. 

$$;
Pros:. talk quality is much better than my old BB. 
Cons:. battery life-no auto off/standby feature. 
Summary:. The EVO is great. 

$$;
Pros:. HDMI, Camera on front and Back, Large Screen, Removable Battery and SD card. 
Cons:. Wish It had an optional physical keyboard like the droid.. 
Summary:. I am glad smart phones are becoming more like mini computers so that I don't have to carry my laptop everywhere.. This phone is large enough to use as a computer and small enough to be convenient. Great Job HTC!. 

$$;
Pros:. The specs and performance on this phone are amazing. I've had it since launch and still find something every day that's useful compared to other smartphone OS so I cannot say enough about how well the Evo, Android, and Sprint work together.. 
Cons:. Battery use is high, but that will be improved with the Android 2.2 update. 
Summary:. My wife and I switched from ATT to Sprint and got Evos. We're both so glad we did. The phone does everything we want, Sprint's network has been a night-day improvement over ATT for us, and the value and savings on our plan from Sprint cannot be matched. If you don't think having unlimited data matters, you're wrong. With a phone like the Evo, you can easily surpass 5GB. In fact, the phone almost encourages it.. We don't live in a 4G area, but that's just a bonus we expect to try out when we travel. This phone excels on Sprint's 3G and is more than enough in 3G to be worth the purchase.. We've read about others' quality complaints, but we have two Evos that have had none of the issues reported. HTC's construction and material quality more than surpassed our expectation.. The Evo, as it stands, is a great phone. If Sprint releases Froyo this summer, the Evo will be the best smartphone available without question now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Widgets, UI (Sense), ease of use, large nice looking screen.. 
Cons:. Haven't had it long enough to find negatives. There is a bit of transition getting used to Android/Sense.. 
Summary:. The phone does what I need it to do and it does it well. While some people get hung up on this feature or that feature of other phones, I know coming from an iPhone 3G, I'm very happy with my purchase. The phone is different, yet still easy to use. The widgets are a very nice feature - I have one whole screen devoted to my calendar. There is a bit of transition learning to use the Android/Sense system but it is fairly intuitive and doesn't take long at all to get used to.. 

$$;
Pros:. Phone n service is beyond amazing. apps truly enhance experience fast, easy to use, simply great. 
Cons:. needs longer battery life. 
Summary:. 2 weeks ago I accidentally ran over my phone w/ my motorized wheelchair and cracked the screen, i had tape placed on the glass to hold it down. My touch screen and all features on the phone completely work to this day. When I Ordered the replacement the service was excellent. I'm currently waiting for it. 

$$;
Pros:. It does everything, and does it pretty well.. 
Cons:. Will have to wait for the 2.2 upgrade since it has htc sense on it.. 
Summary:. It's a great phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's a phone, internet &#38; GPS in one. 
Cons:. None for me. 
Summary:. This is my first smart phone. It was easy to learn and is everything I need for phone calls, turn by turn navigation and surfing the net while waiting at the Dr's office. And, I was able to drop internet service by free tethering. Very cool phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. not many cases available yet. I need one that clips on. I am waiting for the otter box case.. 
Cons:. great phone, battery life could be better. i have found that if i turn things off when not using them, phone battery last great. go figure!!!. 
Summary:. I would not be happy with any other phone after having this one. This phone is great. it has everything and keeps coming out with more. I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome screen with optimal resolution and size, super fast processor, android 2.1 now gives me 99% of what I need, Google Nav &#38; Sprint Nav are both fantastic, video chat, removable battery. Didn?t think I would use it, but kickstand is very handy.. 
Cons:. Big screen equals big phone, size takes some getting used to. Battery life is short if you?re using 4g to download lots of data. Turn 4g off when you?re not using it and the phone uses 3g and has the same battery performance of any other smartphone.. 
Summary:. Best phone out there hands down. No one can honestly argue otherwise based on the spec's. Sprint haters and those iPhone loyals (or iSheeple) will argue that there are better phones out there. But let's face it, people don't like change. Sprint and Android are bringing change and people are scared stiff. Pushing that much data drains the battery no matter if you're on a phone or laptop. All 4g phones will have this problem. iPhone users will have this same issue in a year or two when they finally get 4g. But when Steve Jobs says "just like Wifi, I turn 4g off when I don't need it to preserve battery life", everyone will bow and say that's brilliant. But please remember this post. I said it first. Kudos to HTC and Sprint coming in 1st in the race to 4g AND doing it with the best phone on the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. Processor Speed (Never Lags). Screen (Absolutely Amazing Color and Size). Internet Speeds are BLAZING (Even in 3G they're fast). Good Quality Feel (Firm and Substantial). Unlimited Android Apps (They're free too). Great Browser. HD YouTube!! (Awesome). 
Cons:. Battery only lasts 6 hours with everything turned on and lots of 4G usage. (Lasts a full day with moderate usage and Mobile Network on).. 
Summary:. Overall, I seriously couldn't ask for anything better in a phone. The size is perfect, OS is perfect, Android Market is incredible, phone speed is phenomenal (doesn't slow down with over 30 apps running!!) 4G is faster on my phone than my laptop, lol. Screen quality, color, resolution, and responsiveness is stunning (I still can't believe how amazing looking this phone is, even after a month of usage). 7 screens and an unlimited number of App squares is a really cool feature. There are some really innovative apps and Widgets (my wallpaper is Super Mario playing through the entire game, classic)!! I love not having a data limit (At&#38;t) and love not having to worry about that. HTC has done a great job at syncing up all your phone contacts with Facebook, Myspace, GMail, Hotmail, Twitter, etc. The EVO is by far the very BEST social networking phone on the market (Friend Stream, automatic Twitter, Email, and Wall Post alerts). Kick stand on back is genius and perfect for watching movies or showing YouTube videos to friends. The HDMI out port is a great idea (I show my videos and YouTube videos to friends and family just by connecting one cable). I do wish it had a longer battery life, but I just have to charge it every night and everything is fine. I also have a car charger so when Im using 4G, Bluetooth, GPS, YouTube, and playing Games, I won't have anything to worry about. The Mobile HotSpot sounds really awesome, especially if you travel alot, but I dont need it and haven't tried it yet. Honestly I can't say enough about this incredibly powerful device. Sometimes, I even forget its a phone.. Updated. on Jul 2, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Too many to list, great flow. awesome customization. oh and free apps.. 
Cons:. was the battery, but it got better after the last update.. 
Summary:. Awesomeness.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous screen, awesome rendition, gorgeous screen, and gorgeous screen!!!!. Mobile Hotspot works well, even in 3G. Easy to use. Gives the impression of a technological marvel. 
Cons:. It's big, but it really is true that it doesn't mean much once you start using it.. Compared to other phones, it's cons are pluses!!!. 
Summary:. This phone is simply awesome! It's not perfect, of course, but after experience with Blackberries, WebOS, iPhone, and other Android devices, I can say this phone is truly a marvel!. Just holding it is an eerie, awe evoking experience! Love at first sight!. Don't expect this phone to completely replace your dedicated digital camera or voice recording device, it's not designed to do that (there's a reason why dedicated compact digital cameras cost $300+). But it can adequately replace almost any other smartphone, and probably your internet service provider to boot!. If you are considering this phone, just ask yourself, does this phone adequately meet your needs? Will its features give you the usage you need. Hey, you can get unlimited mobile to mobile to any provider and unlimited internet usage!!. If you have good Sprint reception (typically great in the Los Angeles area, from my years of experience), then this phone is simply a steal (saves tons over other providers).. No phone or network is perfect (my cousin who lives in Los Angeles yearns to get Verizon Wireless reception where she lives, instead of the words "searching for service').. The mobile hotspot is hot!!. I think this phone is simply bliss, an electronic jewel. The screen is big, but that is also part of its awe. And despite it not being perfect in all areas, I still think there are few phone who even come close to offering what it does. (Android is infinitely fun, and the apps will hopefully keep coming.). 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, lightening fast . . . from simple calls (clear on both ends) to pics to vids to the size of the screen it's just the best phone I've ever owned.. 
Cons:. Haven't discovered it yet.. 
Summary:. I've never owned a smart phone so I might not be the best person to describe what to like or not to like about the HTV Evo 4G except that in just a few weeks I've adapted to this brand new world and can't imagine ever being without it again. We're thoroughly enjoying the ability to access information and data wherever we are (NYC is 4G), take pics and share them easily and generally use the tech to make our lives easier and better. The battery drain is an issue so recharging the phone periodically during the day seems to be the solution . . . at least for now. Overall the experience is excellent and we look forward to learning more so that we can do more. Nice to know it's all there. iPhone 4 users eat your hearts out ! ! ! ;-). 

$$;
Pros:. It pretty much does it all. Big screen. Very fast. Competent. Navigation kicks butt. There hasn't been anything I haven't been able to do, see, or hear using this phone.. 
Cons:. Battery life can be bad if you don't research what needs to be done to extend battery life.. 
Summary:. I absolutely love this phone. I had a Palm 650, 700 and 755. I had to get a Blackbery for work and absolutely hated my BB 9630 Tour. Wanted to throw it at a wall a lot of times. Now that I have this EVO...I couldn't be any more happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. EVERYTHING.. 
Cons:. THERE'S NOTHING I DON'T LIKE.. 
Summary:. GO OUT AND PURCHASE THIS DEVICE!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great build quality and I love the monster screen. Not too big not too small and it can still fit in a pocket. Camera is excellent and video is not bad in daylight conditions. Video chat is Awesome and beats iPhone 4 WiFi only limited capability.. 
Cons:. Haven't really found much to not like about this phone. Call quality is amazing and I can actually hold the phone anyway I want without dropping a call. Contrary to some other phones on other networks! So NOTHING bad to report at this time!. 
Summary:. WiMax service in Portland is great &#38; there's nothing like having web pages appear so instantly. Turn by Turn is flawless even with many hills running street view live. The camera although showing compression artifacts in videos in fast movement, is not bad for a phone. At least it's HD and can be easily uploaded direct to YouTube. Used as a camera the pictures are sharp and color is excellent as well as being every bit as good as my point n shoot. So that's another device retired to my drawer along with my iPhone 3G on that other call dropping network. It seems to know when you're leaving 4G coverage and down switches w/o losing a call when on the move in a car. Whereas my iPhone had trouble switching to Edge and this may be the reason iPhones drop more calls on AT&#38;T than it being their fault.. It fits my left hand perfect and then I'm able to navigate the interface with my right easily. I've read some reviews of coverage problems, but when a phone is designed right, it shouldn't be a problem going in and out of coverage areas or how you hold it. It should all work seamlessly and that's how this phone is working for me. Although I only have a few friends with front facing cameras for video conferencing, I now have several friends that have found an excellent solution using Fring or Qik to not only other users with Evo's but anyone with Skype, Google Talk, etc on desktop PC's too. But my buddy is using the old mirror trick to video conference via Fring on his Nexus One and we're having fun with it. He uses his visor mirror in the car (while stopped of course) and it's hilarious what he's finding to use w/o a front facing camera. But.... I'll still take my Evo over his Nexus One any day!. 

$$;
Pros:. the evo is fast, big and packed with cool android and htc features.With sprint i get great service, unlike AT&#38;T which can extremely spotty and i am able to put my itunes on it, which eliminates my ipod. and the internet is great for any webpage.. 
Cons:. Once in awhile might freeze, but only for a second, youtube app could use a little work, but these dont bother me at all, the only thing i wish they improve in other gens is it being a little thinner, i think it would look nicer and better battery. 
Summary:. this phone is big and fast, yes its not perfect, but i dont think we will ever have a phone that is, the keyboard is great both portrait and landscape. the the camera with dual flash and 8mp is amazing, with the battery, it will drain quickly but if u download a task killer its fine. i think if u want a reliable smarphone give the evo a try........you wont be disappointed. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size,Sprint's cost plan,HDMI,2 cameras,sleek and very attractive looking,android os. 
Cons:. work around the battery issue. froyo not available as of yet so waiting on full flash support.scary as hell to drop this thing.. 
Summary:. All said and done...this phone rocks! Even with the battery cons once you tweak it. It's rock solid! I was close to being a lemming and buy an iPhone. Glad I had my own mind to seek out other options on the android platform. Sprint's pricing is still the best out there even with the extra fee. I checked...and check..and realized that the phone is only as good as the carrier behind it. The EVO is fantastic!! And bought two for my wife and I.. Best decision and very happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has an app that will build you a private island, then it turns into a jet and will fly you there -- not really, but it's darn close!. 
Cons:. Nope, not the battery life, see below...the only thing I have against this device is: it's not necessarily an out of the box solve all your problems slice of wonder bread -- you have to actually take a bit of time and figure out how to use the thing.. 
Summary:. I was very weary about purchasing this device not because of bad reviews or negative criticisms, rather, because of living on the bleeding edge of technology has once or twice proved a bad choice. Last year I ran out and purchased the Palm Pre a few days after the launch, upgrading from my MotoRazr and taking my first steps into the world of intelligent phones and mobile web devices. Pre was a nice idea, fortunately for me the EVO came along just in time for my contract renewal date. Compared to previous devices I've owned, what quite simply and totally blows me away is the EVO functions exactly like it is supposed to!. TV, car, phone, computer, whatever it is, I read a lot of product reviews before and after I make most purchases. The thing I find interesting about the world of product reviews are folks who seem to strive in finding everything that might be construed as 'wrong' or 'not up to expectations'. HTC and Sprint never claimed the EVO would last days and days without needing a charge. The $10 additional cost for service is really no big deal. If you compare plans, even with the extra ten-spot, Sprint's everyting data plan is still below the monthly cost from other carriers. The EVOs video quality is amazing, the data speeds are fast, the sync-everything technology is awesome. Also, I can actually make phone calls! I know, right? My previous device had issues making a simple telephone call. After all, isn't that the most basic function we ask of these devices?. My real 'road test' of the EVO was last week. I spent a week in a sparsely populated area of Minnesota at an annual convention for a client. I travel a lot and have been looking for that all in one device of phone, music player, email and web acess. After reading the reviews my main concern was battery life. (Especially becase I've got to have something to play with during those long, drawn out board meetings :)) Coming from a full charge, listened to about 2.5 hours of music (one hour was in ariplane mode), sent email, made several phone calls, and reached the convention site with just over 50% battery remaining. That evening during cocktail hour I had to show off the EVO to all the other gadget freaks in the room, especially the video capabilities and everyone loved the kickstand. Long story short, ended the night with a call home and although the battery meter was in the yellow zone before turning in for the night, the thing still had plenty of juice.. People compare this to the iPhone. I do have to say the iPhone is an incredible device. Personally, aside from iTunes, I've never been a fan of Apple products, especially hardware, and have never been able to comprehend how an Apple product is in any way shape or form superior to the alternative product. And yes I have looked at purchasing many of their prodcts in the past. If you are a user who can understand and actually take the time to know what your device is capable of and adjusting settings to meet your needs, the only advantage to the Apple product is the pretty packaging. The HTC EVO is no different. If you take the time to learn how to use the EVO, how to manage battery consumption by setting longer auto-sync update frequencies and activating 4G only when you need it, you will find this device to provide an all around five star experience. One thing I can agree the EVO has in common with the iPhone is, simply, that it is an amazing device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Battery life. 

$$;
Pros:. very responsive, excellent camera and video capture, surprisingly powerful voice recognition. 
Cons:. battery life. 
Summary:. I had a Treo 800w before, and was actually thinking about upgrading to a BlackBerry. I'm glad I did not. Although this is a phone review I just don't like how Sprint has that $10 premium data fee. Like many of you I don't believe should have this fee for all their markets, but Android 2.2 makes it worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Screen is awesome, multi-touch, HD. - Cameras, yes two cameras!. - Sprint has some great "included" features, such as Navigation by TeleNav (go price it yourself), SprintTV.... - HDMI out. -User defined Scenes - Work &#38; Play!!. 
Cons:. - This phone did not come out sooner!!. - No 4G in the phoenix....yet. - Additional cost for hotspot feature ($30/month). 
Summary:. I absolutely love this phone, previously had the G1 which was also pretty solid, but left a lot to desire. The EVO fulfilled all of the voids and then some.. The 8M pixel takes great pictures and easy to use with some built in features such as ISO control, geo-tagging, autofocus and face detection. It also has a grid setting that places little plus signs on the screen to break the image up into a 3 x 3 grid, which if you know photography that helps with composition of your pictures. Oh and it has a flash too!. The video recording and playback is by far some of the best I have seen for a cell phone.. The ability to set up different scenes allows me to have a setting for work, home, play, and traveling. These are settings that are related to each scene, for example my work setting could have my work email and calendar settings readily available. Then have the play one set up to have my music play on the main screen and have the friend stream set up on another.. And it is actually a great phone! I have had no issues with drop calls at all. The voice on the other end sounds clear and crisp with no crackling etc. And even if I pick the phone up in my hand, it will not drop calls like some other smart phone does...no names mentioned.. All in all, my opinion is this is the best phone out there right now, and if you are lucky to be in a 4G market you have to get this phone and at least give it a try! I am anxiously waiting for Phoenix to get 4G. But even at only 3G I am extremely happy with the phones performance!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great camera HD video recording front facing video camera Android customization and HTC sense Kickstand huge screen without being not usable and cool under battery cover coloring. 
Cons:. Wish the screen was an AMOLED like the droid incredible. 
Summary:. Amazing phone. You might as well forget the iphone 4 with all of the problems and even though the evo doesn't have as many pixels 800x480 in a 4.3 is still very crisp. Heck i cant see a single pixle on the screen anyways. No need for retina. Android customization is still ahead of iphone. And downloading apps even not in the market is awesome. Android FTW!. 

$$;
Pros:. Highly reliable Sprint service, and the ability to customize the UI.. 
Cons:. I really haven't experienced any glaring issues with the EVO. I don't have access to a 4G network, so I can't speak to that, but the phone just flies over 3G, so I can only imagine how it'll perform over 4G.. 
Summary:. I do find myself downloading far more content with this phone than I did with my Palm Pre, possibly because of the bigger screen. I've owned iPhones, BB, the Palm Pre before the EVO, and I can say without reservation that Android shows the most promise, going forward. There are many things I like about Palm's WebOS, and I hope HP puts WebOS on a device similar to the EVO. But for now, I'm very pleased with the experience I've had so far with my EVO.. If you're hesitant to get the EVO because of it being available only through Sprint; don't be! In my experience they've been just plain awesome. Their plans are far less expensive than AT&#38;T's or Verizon's, and their customer service is far better, too.. Remember that your mobile phone experience hinges on your carrier. The new iPhone 4 is the perfect example of a carrier insulting your intelligence. ($25 for 2 gigs of data would last most people about a day and a half.) My Pre, and now my EVO, have been on Sprint, and I couldn't be happier.... If you don't care for the phone, you can return it after 30 days at no cost. I'd suggest you at least give the phone a try. You won't be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size of screen, speed of processor, 720p video, Android, camera and everything else.. 
Cons:. Battery life is short, which is obviously expected of such a device.. 
Summary:. I have been waiting for the phone for months and wouldn't you know the day it comes out I am on vacation and my wife vehemently says NO to buying one out of town. When I get back home I realized I should have pre-ordered one because they are sold out everywhere! Well, two and a half weeks later I finally get mine.. At first look you realize how huge it is but don't worry, it fits nicely in your hand (though if you have smallish hands it may not). It obviously comes with everything good that is Android with its thousands of apps. The camera is quite good, front and back mind you, with the main camera having a flash. It's not as quick as I'd like it to be with pictures and the camera sticks out on the back but the 720p video sure makes up for it. Call quality is great on both ends of the phone although my voicemail echoes on my phone but callers tell me my voice is crystal clear.. The list goes on and on. Did I mention how fast this thing is? I'm sure you won't be experiancing any phone lag any time soon. Granted the battery life isn't too long but it is comparable to other phones in its class. I would think though that since it is larger than most phones that they could have installed a larger battery, or, like my old Instinct, they could have packaged 2 batteries to have one ready at all times.. I am moving to Marietta, GA at the end of July (no, not just for 4G, but it did help the decision :) so I won't be able to rate the 4G experience until then. I can live with an extra $10/mo with or without 4G since it is still cheaper with comparable plans to my friends iPhone or T-Mobile HD2 and another's Moto Droid on Verizon. I can't understand why they won't come to the light! Sprint is now in the lead with 4G, the EVO and unlimited to every cell in America! Why settle for a 10 free numbers when you can have thousands?. One last thing. How in the world did CNET not make the greatest phone an editor's choice?? It is unbelievable! And at least give it 4.5 stars!. 

$$;
Pros:. The EVO is absolutely a revolutionary device in the smartphone market that is second to none. I can use it as a mobile hotspot. Easy to customize and add apps. The HD video recording is outstanding. The 4.3 screen makes it enjoyable and easy to view.. 
Cons:. Battery manufacturers need to keep up with technology. With all that the Evo is capable of doing to get full use you have to tweak the battery. It's not a deal breaker and I have learned rather quickly how to use my mini laptop to it's full potential. 
Summary:. The Evo is my first Android phone and I fell in love with it immediately after the sales rep unboxed it for me. The market store is full of wonderful and popular free apps. I love the video chat features of Fring because you can talk to people on their desktop through Skype, ability to use it as a hotspot and connect up to 8 devices. I can search the web and talk on the phone using 4g or wifi at the same time. The screen is large enough to enjoy movies, photo slideshows and view the internet without squeezing my eyes together. The phone has a sleek and smooth feel that I adore. You will get use to the size day one and wonder how you ever used anything smaller. There is no phone on the market now or in the near future that will put this phone to shame!. 

$$;
Pros:. * Huge bright screen. * 65,000 Android apps. * Fast processor. * Removable battery. * Expandable SD memory. * HD Video player with YouTube HD. * 8MB camera with digital zoom. * HDMI output - EVO acts as an HD receiver. * 4G. 
Cons:. * Only 8 - 14 hours of battery life under hard use. 
Summary:. At $199, the HTC EVO is the best value in smart phones. The Sprint plans are at least a third cheaper than AT&#38;T. If you can find one, buy the EVO.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love all the App, on the facebook &#38; teeter account, it add all my friends facebook pic into my address, &#38; all my friends birthday's into my calendar. Wow! The 8Mp camera is awesome it let you adj ISO, zoom in &#38; out, change the pic color...e. 
Cons:. I am stiill waiting for the 4g to work. 
Summary:. I love this phone. I can watch all the web with flash video fast.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wifi, video chat, HD screen, 4G. 
Cons:. The battery can always be better.. 
Summary:. Best phone ever with all of the bells and whistles you could ever want on a phone.... One Sweet Ride... 

$$;
Pros:. Big vibrant screen. Great call quality. Fast. Big. Fast. 
Cons:. Battery Life. Not many accessories out yet. 
Summary:. Best phone I've ever used by far... including the iphone. 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous display. Android 2.1 (hopefully getting froyo soon). large screen. kickstand to prop phone up on desk. 4G. 
Cons:. only con is the battery life. 
Summary:. This is by far the best Android phone out in the market. Sprint has a definite winner on its hands! lets hope they do the right thing and update the EVO to Froyo ASAP. 

$$;
Pros:. Htc has outdone themselves with this flagship phone from htc. I love the 4.3 inch screen, new iphone still 3.5???? and still dropping calls. Sprint networks is rock solid, this phone is fast and a joy to use. excellent build quality.. 
Cons:. battery life needs to be longer. Their is a software update due out next week to address this issue. For the android OS to be out for only 18 months very impressed. 
Summary:. Having owned several smart phones including 2 iphones I love the thoughtful features that HTC incorportated into this unit, Luv the kickstand, 4.3 inch screen makes typing a breeze, beautiful hd display, front facing and rear 8mp camera which takes beautiful pictures for a mobile phone. Not enslaved to Apples world ...freedom to download any program I want and customize at my discretion. Call quality has been impressively clear on both ends, data connections speeds in 3g are very fast, have not even tried 4g as of yet. Hdmi output,, able to use the phone as a wifi hotspot. unlike the new iphone video conferencing does not depend on both callers having a wifi connection.....no phone is perfect and has it quirks by far the positives for this phone far outweigh the negative. I phone 4g may be a work of art, still drops calls and is still on the Network that cant hold a call, ATT. 

$$;
Pros:. Great fit finish, large screen, nice Audio and video, FAST, great apps, great customer service. Unlimited data plan, you can buy an extra battery.. 
Cons:. None no issues this phone rocks.. 
Summary:. Hi,. This is a Fantastic phone. I have an Apple iTouch and they both work well. Sprints Unlimited Data plan with 4G is far less expensive than AT&#38;T and and Sprint has great customer service. 4G and 3G speeds are extreamly fast. Buy an extra $6 battery via EBay and you have the best phone. I've added 6 screens of Apps and they work great. I bought a $6 battery and a $15 16GB memory card new on Ebay. I also bought a $12 radio cassett 3.5 mm adapter, I now can stream Pandora and Pod casts over my car stereo and hear phone calls on my cars raidio. Also if you have Itunes install a free app called Double X it will copy all your iTunes songs and play lists to the EVO. This phone ROCKS. Its complex learn to install and use the Apps when you first buy it the Sprint people will teach you some tricks. Also upgrade the system firmware it takes 30 seconds. Also the camera and video are fantastic.. Take care. Dave. Updated. on Jul 22, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. ...only when Cnet horizontally stretches its photo!!!. 
Cons:. ----------. 

$$;
Pros:. 4G. Gorgeous screen. Lightning fast processor. Good camera/ HD video camera. Unmatched customization. Video calls on 3G/4G network to phones or computers. Sense UI. Google's apps. HQ Youtube. Great call quality (nice to see on a smartphone nowadays). 
Cons:. Mandatory $10 add-on (I have no 4G where I live, so its kinda bogus since I'll hardly ever use it, but it does insure you 100% unlimited data use period, so its not too bad). 
Summary:. Bottom line, this phone is an astounding bit of technology and I highly recommend it. HTC made a responsive, beautiful piece of hardware. Couple that together with the openness of Android and you get a phone that you can make your own. Video chat works very well too. I have only used Fring to call my friend's Skype account on her laptop, and it was okay sound quality and there was no issue with the video. Mind you, I was doing this on Sprint's 3G network, not WIFI or 4G. And that's important, you CAN use video chat over the mobile 3G OR 4G network; you aren't restricted to WIFI like on other devices. The battery isn't gonna last days at a time, you'll have to recharge nightly, but that charge should be more than enough to last the day, and I'm a heavy user myself. Lastly, the device is larger, but once you see the screen you won't care because its totally worth it. Besides, even for its size its very thin and very pocketable. I have never had an issue with Sprint's service, and they offer plans significantly more affordable than comparable plans with Verizon or AT&#38;T (hello NO smartphone mandated data rate). The phone preforms outstandingly on all accounts and to find its faults takes some effort, perhaps even some bias?, and for that I say this phone is one of the top on the market. Its 3G/4G compatibility means its built to keep up in the future, which seems to take leaps and bounds forward every month. Is it the best now? I think so, but you'll have to decide for yourself!. 

$$;
Pros:. Large, beautiful screen. Fast. Open architecture and lots of cool apps.. 
Cons:. Battery could be better, but it is NOT as bad as people make it out to be. Wish it had 802.11n and wish that it would natively support MKV and DIVX. 

$$;
Pros:. everything two days in and not even close to finding everything yet buy buy i phone you had your run now your done. 
Cons:. battery life could be a little better put they are working on it already and it on the way. 
Summary:. easy smoth movement big screen easy to view contracts and documents and i do it all day well worth the 199.00. a phone that does it all sprint you got my intrest whats next thankyou and for the people that want one and cant find one go to best buy no mail in rebate or extra fees. 

$$;
Pros:. -Rooting is available to those who want to take full advantage of a handheld, pocket-sized linux based computer.. -Games look amazing, given the cap on the FPS. -When available, 4G is a speed demon...1134kBps!. 
Cons:. -Graphics Cap @ ~30 FPS. -It seems that you need to be stationary when using 4G in Houston.. - Touch buttons for Home, Menu, Back, and Search are easily pushed and therefore sometimes problem-matic.. -Not a one-handed phone by any means, see above con. -. 
Summary:. Root complete....Nand root complete....Fresh0.3 installed using dxTop rather than Sense. Since the root i have been 10+ hours off charge texting, downloading, uploading, gaming, streaming, and calling. This was not straight 10+ hours of usage of course. I used 300-400MBs, ran the cpu upto 998Mhz for a period of ~45 mins twice in the 10 hours, On youtube I wathced two episodes of Topgear and the BP oilspill spoof, and tethered for wifi for around 25 mins. All of that brought me down to a critcal 7% life remaining.. Under the stock setup battery life suffers greatly. You will need to disable background updates as well as turn off WiFi when not around any ap's. The WiFi constantly scans for open or protected ap's which in turn drains battery life. Watching youtube longer than 2 hours will shorrten your day with the EVO 4G.. Running 4G is obviously going to reduce the battery charge greatly due to higher data transfer rates.. I feel very comfortable paying an additional 10$ fee to Sprint for the "Premium Data Package", it is still less than the unlimited plans available at Verizon, AT&#38;T, and T-Mobile.. Keep in mind this is a computer complete with a disk drive, wifi, bluetooth, 8MP camera and a 1.3MP front facing camera, vibrating motor, 4 POINT 3 INCH 800x480 WVGA LCD screen and a phone to round everything out. In short dont expect miracles with a measly 1500mAh battery, I recommend the 1700mAh option available elsewhere. I havent made that jump yet but given my current setup i will most likely increase my usage time to 12-13 hours under moderate data use.. Updated. on Jun 22, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. HUGE screen, 4G, WIFI, HOTSPOT, 8meg camera (crystal clear) HD VID, expandable/swapable memory card. 
Cons:. Battery is not great. I have quelled this by limiting my running apps and turning off wifi, bluetooth when not needed... when you use the phone like a computer, expect the battery to drain like a computer.. 
Summary:. Effectively? this is like having an iphone in your pocket. I shop, watch movies, surf net, check email... its endless. When android froyo 2.2 uploads, the future is here.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen is large and spacious. Processor runs great and will be even better when they update it to 2.2. Call quality is good. The Forward facing camera works better than expected. Records in 720p. Never locks up. On screen qwerty works well.. 
Cons:. The only con if you can call it a con is the battery. It lasts me till 9-10 PM.. 
Summary:. All the negative reviews of this phone have come from people that don't own it. See a trend? People are saying you can't talk and use the data at the same time. You can. As long as you're on wifi, 4g or 3g. Don't listen to the negative reviews. I've owned 2 different iphones and a g1. This is by far the best phone I've ever owned. It's not even close to the competition. If you were thinking about getting a iphone 4g or a Droid incredible do more research on this phone. It has more features than both. Do your research and buy this phone. you won't be disappointed. Don't listen to the naysayers.. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is AMAZING!! It's clear, crisp, and beautiful!. The Android software is also out of this world. It runs so smoothly (partly due to the 1ghz processor this baby has under the hood)! I also love the app store!. 
Cons:. The phone does go through its battery faster than many other phones. But I haven't found this to be an issue, since I charge my phone every night. The battery lasts about 10 hours with HEAVY use. But it will last much longer with light-medium use.. 
Summary:. The Evo is an amazing phone. It's fast, feature-packed, gorgeous to look at, and the world's ONLY 4G smartphone. If someone told me a month ago that I was going to give up my iPhone, leave AT&#38;T, and buy a smartphone from Sprint, I would have thought them to be crazy. But after getting my hands on an Evo at my local Best Buy, there was no way I could limit myself to another 2 years with AT&#38;T and its underwhelming "new" iPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Call quality is far superior to my Blackberry; Best Internet browser with top speed; Screen size and stunningly crisp visual display; Customizability; Photo capture quality; HD video &#38; effects options... and the list goes on and on!. 
Cons:. I thought battery life was a con until I changed some settings, and tweaked my my new gadget to perfection. Now I haven't a complaint in the world.. 
Summary:. I literally spent half a day playing around with my phone &#38; seeing all I could do with it. What really sold me was the browser since I'm always on line and need it for my research. I've also got friends around the globe &#38; this phone's features helps me stay in touch regularly with them all. I've yet to use the video chat feature, but look forward to doing so very soon! Two last great things: The external speaker can get loud (with the hearing impaired setting on), without compromising the device's superb sound quality. Also, the speech to text feature is a wonderful bonus... especially for my my Internet research.. To extend the phone's battery life:. It will take you about 30 minutes or so to properly set up your phone for maximizing the battery life, but you'll be very happy you did. If you like to play a lot, are often online and multi-task like me... you really must change some settings on you phone, and do a lot more than is suggested on Sprint's site. Call Sprint's tech support and be sure to pick the reps brains for tips and tricks. As with any tech team, some tech reps are more tech savvy than others (so if you need to call back to get the right one, by all means, do so). It's obviously best to get someone who actually owns the Evo or other HTC android phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. really big beauiful screen perfect for typing. Great network better than at&#38;t. Sorry iphone. 
Cons:. Nothing perfect phone.. 
Summary:. I really wanted the iphone 4 but i look at this phone and i think it's a lot better than the iphone 4.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone replaced my Palm Pre and I love it. Lots of apps, snappy performance, good battery life (14 hours under reasonable use, after tweaking settings, esp. turning off "Enable always-on mobile.."), decent camera, good speakerphone, great design.. 
Cons:. Voice quality is not great out of the earpiece, breaks up a bit when the call volume is turned up. Not bad for me since I tend to use a Bluetooth headset for longer conversations.. 
Summary:. I'd recommend this phone to anyone. I've tried a lot of smart phones, and this one has the best combination of features and performance I've seen so far. I won't deny the iPhone 4g has (as usual) a slick design, but it lacks 4g, and I really don't appreciate Big Brother Steve telling me what internet content I should view. Long live Android.. As I mention above, you can get good battery life out of the phone by tweaking some settings, particularly by disabling "Enable always-on mobile..." under the settings for Wireless &#38; networks, Mobile networks. 4G is awful on battery life, so it's most useful when you can externally power the phone, as is likely when you're doing something more bandwidth intensive, such as tethering. I leave 4G off most of the time, and the performance has been fine for my needs.. Very cool.. 

$$;
Pros:. Mobile Hot Spot, 4G for my area, full Google integration, personalized home screen, Android O/S, 30-Day Money Back Guarantee with Sprint, unlimited data, Android voicemail, Android notification. 
Cons:. Battery life, if it switches to 3G while running as a hot spot, you have to reset to get it back to 4G. 
Summary:. I second most of the positive reviews here. I actually decided to write this review to clarify a couple things I read in one of the previous reviews.. First, I have been able to receive phone calls even while I have my phone on Hotspot. Because I'm trying to get rid of my home internet (so I can save money), I was a bit concerned about it. I don't get that many phone calls, so I didn't think it was going to be a big deal. One day, though, I was surfing the internet on my computer, using the phone as a hotspot, and the phone rang. Someone mentioned this wasn't possible, and I just wanted to offer another experience.. Second, the speeds on 4G aren't 9MPS where I am. I am constantly speed testing it (using an Android app from speedtest.net), and I consistently get 2MPS and 2.5MPS down. .7-1MPS up. Which is fine. My suspicion is that these speeds are going to get better as time goes on. Yeah, yeah, I know that people say WIMAX is going to clog up its network, and LTE is going to be the more advanced technology. But these are the same things people said about Cable internet, when it was competing against DSL. And, from what I can see, Cable is still fastest.. Third, if you use Google for things (I use it religiously for calendar, gmail, picasa, and maps), you are immediately signed in to your whole internet world. I had all my contacts and phone numbers entered in Google contacts, and I had to enter no phone numbers into my phone. The experience is amazing. It took one sign in, and I was done. I have an iPod touch, and I had to enter my signin for whatever I was using.. Last thing, the battery situation. Yeah, it's kind of annoying. The main plus is that Android lets you customize so much on the phone, and the home screens. I have the switch widgets for all the services on this phone (GPS, 4G, WiFi, 3G, Hot Spot) on my home screen, and when I'm not using them, I make a point of switching them off. One thing to keep in mind, though, when the battery on this phone goes dead, I can buy a new one and replace the old one myself. You have to send an iPhone back to Apple for the same thing. Really, that's not good design.. In the end, this phone can do so many more things than an iPhone (like 4G, customization, multi-notification, etc.), but all the iPhone people can hit it on is the battery life.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size, it's super Fast when opening apps. 8 MP camera takes sharp beautiful pictures, the second smaller camera takes pretty good pictures too. Mulitasking and total customization of most aspects of the phone.. 
Cons:. None so far, I am already used to battery issues on phones like these thanks to my iPhone (home charger, car charger, work charger, battery pack), I will just have to upgrade all my chargers for this new phone.. 
Summary:. I left an iPhone 3G for this phone and do not regret it one bit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blazing browser speeds, easy to use once you get the hang of it, beautiful quality screen, front and rear camera, 8 meg rear camera! Text to speech (which is the best!). 
Cons:. Blue tooth activated calling won't be out until Android 2.2 is released. 
Summary:. Worth every penny. Sprint service is no better or worse than any other service. They all use the same towers! Sprint family shared plans are reasonable with anytime any mobile calling. When 4G gets here, I'll be in my glory!. 

$$;
Pros:. Super Fast, Awesome Screen, Video Chat, Great Camera. 
Cons:. None Really. 
Summary:. Just switched to the Evo from my Palm Pre. This phone is so much more advanced than any other phone out there right now. Screen is incredible to watch videos and 4G is so fast. It's faster than my internet at home, averaging about 3Mbps on speed tests for downloads (I'm in Kansas City area). Love that I can customize everything on the home screens unlike the Palm Pre where I could move stuff but not nearly the amount of flexibility as the Evo. Also the battery lasts me a full day with about 1/2 left at night and that is moderate use and using 4G most of the time. Zero complaints so far after about 1 week of use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, many applications to choose from and very fast internet with a flash player that plays many videos from sites that other phone cant play videos from. Easy to use keyboard and text prediction is wonderful. I does EVERYTHING you need.. 
Cons:. battery life on the phones tends to die pretty fast and you may experience some delays in response of turning the phone in the horizontal position. I sometimes have to shake the phone a little to get it to respond. But not often at all.. 
Summary:. I've used many features on this phone and still find myself glued to it after hours and hours of browsing its ability. I love the fact that you can do some much with it not to mention its screen size knocks the competition out of the box. The iPhone does have higher res but the only difference in noticing this is if you had both phones side by side. With sprint service, it makes it even better. Sprint customer service is the best service overall I have ever had. They fix the issues I need fixed immediately. But that's a sprint review. As for the phone I was using the hotspot watching netflix on my laptop, on the phone having a conversation, and text messaging all together on the 4G network. I'm love this phone!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very snappy hardware. Screen is amazingly awesome, very crisp and clear. Plenty of apps to choose from. Battery Life is pretty good, since I began using task killers.. 
Cons:. The background tasks are horrible. Its good that there are task killers to ultimately save you battery life.. 
Summary:. Bottom-line When I had the Pre I was so happy with something compact and sexy. But the Evo 4G is such a better build quality and overall specs are amazing. It's big, very big, but that is something that well makes it stand out. Both cameras front and rear facing are pretty good. Video is very clear and its not like I'm going to film a movie with it so it does what it needs to do. Coming from the Pre I miss the dedicated ringer/vibrate switch but I've gotten use to that. Kick stand comes in handy when you just want to rest it somewhere since if you lay it flat on its back you could possible scratch the lens on the rear camera. So if there is anyone wondering if they should get this phone...the answer should be yes. Its very well built and quite frankly awesome overall.. 

$$;
Pros:. Massive, crystal clear screen, blazing fast, good battery life, solid construction.. 
Cons:. Only comes with 8 GB memory, Limited Apps.. 
Summary:. I have never written a review on CNET, but I felt impelled to write one after my personal experience with this phone stands in sharp contrast to most of the reviews online. I had major reserves about purchasing this phone after reading about the abysmal battery life and SD card issues. Without going into too much detail, people in a similar position can rest assured that the battery life is more than adequate. I regularly get a full day of battery life and I like to think I use the phone moderately to heavily throughout the day. Additionally, it is compatible with micro USB chargers so you should find no issues charging it at the office or topping up in the car without spending an arm and a leg on the charging unit. That being said, I do recommend the igo car charger. In a 15 min drive I gained 20 percent on my battery, not bad in my book! I really cannot figure out why my experience with the battery life is so positive compared to the reviews, but I just felt it was important to provide another POV. Also, regarding the SD card issues, it seems the HTC firmware update solved the issue because I have not experienced any problems. I highly recommend this phone. The features are every bit as impressive as they sound on paper and I have spent over a week marveling at the refined quality of this phone. It definitely sets a benchmark for all future smartphones!. P.S. I wrote this review on my Evo. :). 

$$;
Pros:. So many Pros! FAST. SMART. The touchscreen is incredibly responsive. Startup is a lot faster. The 4G speeds I have not yet experienced and I am still extremely impressed with the functionality. I use the wifi hotspot for my iPad and its great.. 
Cons:. Talking with it to my ear can be uncomfortable at times. I just haven't found the right way to hold it I guess. I think it is my ears fault to be honest.. 
Summary:. I wouldn't have had it any other way. This phone is lightning fast and super efficient. I would recommend to those I am closest with and I already have. Two friends have left their iPhones shortly after test driving my Evo.. Great job HTC and awesome job Sprint! I finally have a phone that I am proud to own!. Oh... the kickstand - while you wouldn't think would be too useful - comes in very handy!. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size, speed. 
Cons:. Battery life but that's to be expected. 

$$;
Pros:. 4G! - music storage (you no longer have to deal with iTunes), hotspot, good camera and video, Sense supports virtually every full version web page for browsing, touch screen works great, awesome display, large selection of apps to choose from. 
Cons:. You need to manage power savings options to preserve battery life, but what do you expect for a phone that can do so much?. 
Summary:. This phone literally does everything and at seamless speeds provided you have access to 4G. I live in Houston, so I am privy to 4G access, and yes there is a huge difference between 3G and 4G. The only times I can't access 4G is if I'm buried in a building with multiple floors, which for me is rare.. If your area doesn't offer 4G, you might want to hold off, because the 4G is what ties all the features of this phone together. I got rid of my land line high speed internet provider (roadrunner) in lieu of the 3G/4G Sprint Wireless Aircard a few months ago, so this isn't my first rodeo with 4G. I was skeptical that "tethering" the phone would work as well as the aircard, but I can assure you it does.. The cons being written are ridiculous. The two that I keep reading are battery life and the mandatory $10 premium. The battery life gripe is somewhat legitimate, but you've got to factor in practical limitations here. Batteries this small and light simply do not exist that can power all of these functions for extended periods. It's just a fact. Any phone manufacture packing all this features into a portable phone this small (relatively speaking) will have the same issue.. Anyways, on a fully charged battery, I ran practically every function on the phone for 10 hours straight before the low battery warning came on. The next day, I toggled off functions when I wasn't using them and I still had half a charge after 10 hours. If you get this phone, I'd recommend getting a car charger and get used to plugging it in every time you get in the car as well as tethering it to your computer whenever your using it. If you do that, you'll easily be able to get through the day without the batter dying no matter how much you use it.. $10 data premium - Look, Sprint is hands down the cheapest service provider for smart phones. For 98% of the public, the 69.99 plan (450 anytime minutes with unlimited mobile to mobile (Regardless of the provider!) and unlimited data will be more than sufficient. The extra $10 brings it to 79.99 and still much cheaper than it's competitors. If you want the hotspot feature, it's an extra 29.99. Yes, that's starting to get expensive, but if your like me, I can justify that cost because 4G allowed me to get rid of Roadrunner, which costs the exact same, yet I now have the extra benefit of being completely mobile. It's a win-win situation for me.. Bottom line is this service fits all of my internet and mobile service needs. If you download movies or use internet gaming functions (X-box live, etc.) you can't do what I've done. But if you just need basic surfing and emailing capabilities you should do what I have done.. As for the phone itself, there's really nothing that isn't great about it. The one thing I love is that I finally don't have to deal with iTunes. You can just drag and drop mp3 files onto the 8GB micro SD card. The touchscreen and intuitiveness of the software is better than the iPhone in my opinion. I really like the extra "home row" buttons. It will take you a few hours to get used to it all though, but once you figure it out, you'll really enjoy it.. The camera and video are better than anything I've ever seen on a smartphone. It's not perfect and depending on the lighting, it has a hard time staying in focus, but overall, it's a big step up from the blackberry Curve 8330 camera I've been used to. Basically, it'll get the job done for the everyday amatuer photo/video taking needs, but you might have to take 2 or 3 pictures until you get one in focus.. Google Maps Navigation is a great tool. It's easy to search, and you don't have to have the address. I've searched the names for some "mom and pop" type businesses, and the software was able to find them. I was very impressed. The turn by turn voice prompt isn't sounds like a computer is talking to you, but at least you can understand it, and it is extremely accurate and timely.. Bottom-line is this phone does everything well. I've yet to run into any glitches or have the phone freeze up on me. I'm confident this phone will not be overshadowed by any other phone on the market anytime soon including the new iPhone. Therefore, it's a good investment and an essential one if you live in a 4G area. Apples to apples, Sprint is more affordable for all the services you get and has a very reliable network infrastructure.. 

$$;
Pros:. No data cap - 3G &#38; 4G. Screen is crystal clear &#38; More responsive than my old iPhone. Blazing Fast even when running multiple apps.. Kickstand is very useful.. 8 mp camera with autofocus allows me to take better pictures then my old Canon does.. 
Cons:. BATTERY runs low quickly. 

$$;
Pros:. 7 screens to save apps on. Big screen so you don't have to squint to watch movies or work apps. Front facing camera. 4G Network. Slick design. Very clear graphics. Links to Google account. Over 100 more apps.. 
Cons:. It is very wide. I actually carry it in my back pocket like my wallet.. 
Summary:. Bottom line is that it might take Apple a few years to come out with a phone that compares and even then it seems like HTC, Google and Android have become great competitors in this market. I cannot see Apple staying on top as long as phones like the EVO keep being put out by HTC and Droid.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, operating system, processing speed, possibilities. 
Cons:. Battery life could be an issue, but definitely competes well with iphone battery life, and has major option lacking in iphone -- get a back up battery!. 
Summary:. I've used an iphone for the past two years (most recently, 3gs). What interested me, frankly, was the amazing low monthly contract price for 4G service. So I was expecting to give up some iphone glitz to save more than 100 per month per month on phone charges (made possible by integrated mobile hotspot on the Evo -- I can toss the $60 per month mifi).. But I am feeling zero "no iphone" pain. This thing rocks. The big screen is awesome. The browser is awesome. The processor is snappier than iphone, and even on 3g this thing can do amazing stuff (life watch TV for instance?).. The best part is the openness -- tons of interesting apps on Anroid market and also -- yeah! -- I feel like I'm out of the Apple ecosystem prison. Apple's refusal to play openly in order to protect simplicity and market share -- and charge you more for being in the closed system -- that finally just started to irritate the crap out of me. Android is wide open and it's a refreshing experience. Every time I read a story about someone who couldn't get their app approved I felt like I was living in a Soviet gulag. Go to a Sprint store and play with one of these things and check the contract price, you'll be amazed.. 

$$;
Pros:. The large screen is great. The operating system is the best! I should have 4G in a few months here in the L.A. market. 
Cons:. You need to keep a spare battery if you use the Evo a lot.. 
Summary:. The phone is fun. Android operates smoothly and the look of the phone is very elegant.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen - cameras - video chat - apps. Blazing fast w/ 4g and snapdragon processor - faster than my laptop at loading pages.. 
Cons:. Tweaking to get the battery right - but it is manageable - With this much power, and this many features, can't expect to have them all on all the time and not drain the battery. Already seen pretty big improvements - expect full day.. 
Summary:. Love it. So glad to be done w/ AT&#38;T and all the dropped calls..
