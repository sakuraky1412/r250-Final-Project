glossy screens are the stupidest invention of this millenium .

4 do not get wax on your screen .

0 out of 5 stars bad lcd screen, october 7, 2009

screen brightness is very satisfactory .

hard to see full web pages on small screen, resolution inadequate .

only 10, inch screen, small keyboard and no cd, rom .

1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several toolbars have been turned on .

long battery life, sharp looking machine, fingerprint magnet,glossy screen=glare,ease of use and portability .

pretty decent screen quality .

blue screen crashed several times .
