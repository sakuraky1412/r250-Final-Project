$$;
Pros:. Easy to configure, very secure mount, spoken directions clear and website very useful. Exactly what you expect a GPS to be. Great price. Boots up fast and find its location well. Very accurate and quick response... 
Cons:. Does not say street names. Can't play MP3s. Does not read ebooks. Map updates are not free (but no one's are). Only USA map, no Canada, Mexico, etc.. I didn't care about any of these, so these "cons" are irrelevant to me.. 
Summary:. Durable, easy-to-read display and I like I can easily remove from mount to store in glovebox or pocket while not in car. Can be password-protected and personalized. TomTom software easy to use and helpful to back up or restore it.. 

$$;
Pros:. its easy to use, the mount works well and very light. maps are up to date and can be adjusted if needed therw the tom tom website. it picks up the GPS signal verry fast, its the best $100s I've ever spent. 
Cons:. None at all.. 
Summary:. I knew what I was buying, I diden't want to spend a lot, I just wanted a good working GPS, it works great with OS X. and is much better then the Magellen GPS I had, that the maps were out of date when I baught it and would have cost me as much to update, then it did to buy this, with a better interface and it picks up the GPS signal much faster. I would recomend this to anyone who wants a good GPS that won't let them down and won't cost them a ton.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, portability, rapid fix, intuitive operations. 
Cons:. One minor detail about the suction cup mount. 
Summary:. I purchased this only because I had a $75.00 Dell gift card. However, I am hooked on this model. My previous GPS (a Pharos 140, see my review) totally sucked and I would only recommend it for dumpster ballast.. First, a word about people who complain or criticize that it doesn't have BlueTooth, or some other high-end feature; lighten up. If you desire those features then buy a GPS that has them; don't criticize one that doesn't.. This is a terrific entry-level GPS. It initializes quickly and is accurate. I have tried most of the features and found this GPS to be very user-friendly and the touch-screen functions are most intuitive.. The only problem (and a very minor one at that) is that there is no locking detent on the suction cup mount to keep the ring from backing off. Tom may want to think about that for a re-design.. Other than that, a top-notch GPS for a budget-minded person.. 

$$;
Pros:. This device is easy to use. It is a Special Edition model with text-to-speech spoken street names. Takes me right to my destination. Connecting it to my iMac was easy, the device had the software built in.. 
Cons:. To connect the home USB cable is a bit tricky.. 
Summary:. I got a great Black Friday deal on this unit. This GPS is more than I expected for the price I paid.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap Price. Easy to use. Updates at TomTom Home FREE. 
Cons:. Mount is cheap.. 
Summary:. NO Newbie here. Had Garmin and IGO before. TOMTOM is basic but has POIs and Great Maps. Who needs 3D buildings in there map anyway. Anyway for the price can't beat it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Touch sceen very accurate. Points of intrest. user friendly. Variety of options. Very customizable. clear lound sound. battery life. In box assesorries (mounting). display very clear. THE PRICE !!!. 
Cons:. Maps are updated QUATERLY 99$ to update.. No Bluetooth, but its only 100$. 
Summary:. Ok, hers the scoop. I was very apprehensive at first, but loved it right out of the box. Got it started quick. I have the VZ nav on my phone and depended on it alot , but now im cancelling my VZ nav, this a device you have to try for yourself , you wont be disappointed. I cant wait to play with it again, makes me want explore new places. Give it a try!!!. Updated. on Nov 29, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Fairly intuitive with predictive text input.. Sounds nice and loud.. Simple menus that don't take long to learn.. Easy to add new features, like traffic camera warnings and user-submitted road corrections.. 
Cons:. No literary trip planning.. No text-to-speech (street name speech). Somewhat difficult to reroute route away from trouble areas.. Had some problems with the car mount.. 
Summary:. I bought this unit during Christmas '08 as a present to myself due to poor navigation skills. For the most part I can say it has done a great job of getting me from point A to B. The maps seem to be for the most part accurate (see below) and have has little trouble getting to where I need.. I have only had trouble getting to one particular friend's house, where it sends me a few blocks away. Maybe some confusion on road naming, I don't know, and his house seems to be unique in this problem. However, when I did a trip across state lines to visit a friend, did a great job of planning my trip, finding gas stations, telling me the estimated time, etc. That one bad location aside, can't say I have had that many problems navigation-wise.. The car mounting part that came with the unit does not always seem to stick and it has fallen off multiple times. I have stuck it and pulled on it and it feels like a solid suction, but 10 minutes in it will come loose. On the other hand, have had it stick for multiple hours as well, so I don't know. Have considered simply buying a mat and gluing the mount to the GPS mat to prevent having it fall again.. I would definitely say that this item is a good buy, especially since most stores I have gone to now sell this at around $100 or less.. 

$$;
Pros:. This TomTom One gives you the security you want knowing where you are at all times. Whether you are looking for a destiation or finding your way back home wihout having to read a road map while driving.. 
Cons:. I wish you could make the words on the screen a little larger. I woud also like t have the TomTom say the street names as you travel.. 
Summary:. Overall, for the price, this TomTom has all the features I want and need plus as a bonus it can keep an eye on your speed for you and I love the day/night light.. This product is great for young people that are just starting to drive and are unsure how to get to a place and how to get back. Saves you a lot of worrying about them. Plus if they have car problems, they can call you and tell you exactly where they are by looking at the TomTom.. 

$$;
Pros:. design, compact size, portability and great features. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. Great value and I am happy with it!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast and accurate...... Don't pinch your pocket much :). 
Cons:. Hard to find any CONS in here...... Its my first time use of a GPS, and found it wonderful. 
Summary:. Nothing like a TOM TOM. Try it once and you feel feel the quality. 

$$;
Pros:. I like how small it is but easy to see and great features.. 
Cons:. I have a hard time snapping it in the holder in the car. Sometimes I lhit a bump and it pops out.. 
Summary:. Over all I love it. I know several friends who purchased one and love it. Price is very reasonable and very affordable on a low budget.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate, easy to use, can't get lost unless you ignore the directions.. 
Cons:. Sometimes the windshield mount is not quite secure and falls off when attempting to use the touch screen. Need to make sure it is firmly latched in the ring adapter.. 
Summary:. I really like the display, the accuracy and the voice directions.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive $99.00. Fast satellite acquisition. Accurate and current maps (at least in North Texas). Flexibility of map color selection. Numerous voices (including Darth Vader) for free. The TomTom community. Able to correct maps. Unique window mount. 
Cons:. Nothing. But if I have to complain about something it's the fact that it doesn't announce street names.. 
Summary:. I own a Magellan Roadmate 2000, a Garmin Nuvi 760 and a TomTom 125. The TomTom 125 was a bargain at only $99.00 and it does a great job. The map is accurate and satellite aquisition is fast. The TomTom community offers free voices, cars, &#38; map updates from fellow users. Although it doesn't have Bluetooth, MP3 capability, or picture viewer like my Garmin it does exactly what a GPS should do...get you from point A to point B. If all you need is an accurate GPS you can't go wrong with this unit. BUY IT!. 

$$;
Pros:. The price was the only pro I can think of. 
Cons:. Cant keep the sound working. Dont like the way the map displays next road. Dont like the way the option of clearing a route works. 
Summary:. My first GPS was an LG. I lost the computer chip to it or I would still be using it. The TomTom doesn't come close in comparison to the quality of the LG. I would like to be able to get my money back; but too late.. 

$$;
Pros:. I would have to Agree with most of the Reviews the Item is Pretty Swell. Did not really Cost very Much and Straight out of the Box it was rather Simple to Use. 
Cons:. The mount Thingy is not very Stable Kinda Annoying to tell the truth. And the Battery Life could certainly use some Extended Life, (it tends to dies quickly, and And Does not charge Quickly). 
Summary:. It wasnt bad, My other &lt;a href="http://www.Trackstick.com"&gt;Gps System&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;b&gt;TrackStick&lt;/b&gt; which Is targeted more towards the gadgets and Portable Device integration for Google Maps and Map Quest. So This Item was move integrated for automotive use. Its was Kewl...Not an issue about it to tell the truth...it was very swell...;). 

$$;
Pros:. This was a present, I have never used a GPS before. It was pretty easy to get going, and is great in places where it is easy to get lost.. 
Cons:. The mount is annoying. The battery dies quickly when not used, and takes a long time to re-charge. Sometimes, the return route is not the same as going, this can be confusing. It does not always obey request to go via a certain road.. 
Summary:. The 125 is a great value, especially in this economy. If you need a GPS, and having one really beats printing out maps off the internet, it is a good choice. While you don't get advanced features at this price, see if you really need them. There are a few quirks. One in particular is the command to 'merge onto motorway'. That is confusing if there are multiple exits right up ahead. But OTOH, it responds VERY quickly if i deviate slightly from it's route, say to bypass a red light, or if I miss a turn. Nowadays, it is very trendy to have everything widescreen. But it has been pointed out that for a GPS, you need to see what is ahead, not what is to the side. So the 4x3 screen works just fine, no need to feel techno-deprived.. 

$$;
Pros:. The functions of the system are easy to find and use. The menu's are pretty well laid out and easy to find and access settings.. 
Cons:. Almost no POI's. Very little battery life. Mount is quite flimsy and the suction only worked for a couple of months. Doesn't automaticly switch to night view. :( Sometimes would require a restart to aquire satelites.. 
Summary:. For a cheap GPS, it wasn't to bad but there are systems out there with the same price tag that will give you more. It seemed like they were so focused on getting the on screen menu's just right that they forgot about everything else. The mount, poi's, aquireing satelites, ect.... The screen size was a little small but that's the case with most in this price range. I'd look toward another system even if you want to save some dough. This one for most people probably won't be worth the $$'s.. 

$$;
Pros:. It became easy to use once application problem was corrected.. 
Cons:. I found the TomTom website very confusing and hard to use. I had to delete the application and load a new application before it would work properly. They have a fix this, but I had to call support three times to complete it.. 
Summary:. I should have purchased a Nuvi. It was way too much trouble to get the One 125 working correctly, and I found their website support difficult to navigate. If they know they have a problem with the application, why don't they mention it in the manual?. 

$$;
Pros:. Good size. Good volume. Easy to use. Easy to read. Easy to mount. Inexpensive (Got a new one for $58.). 
Cons:. The maps are extremely inaccurate. The device couldn't find my house. Says I live half a block away. A major road that has been complete for about 15 years is not complete on the maps forcing the GPS to use longer alternate routes.. 
Summary:. If the maps were accurate I would have rated the product with about 4.5 stars. I have already submitted map correction. But, none have been made, changed, or verified like the manual says. The device is only as good as the maps it can read. I would only recommend this product if the maps get fixed.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought it because of a rebate. Performs basic functions well. Does nice job planning fastest route. 
Cons:. Estimated trip time is always off, as much as 1 hour on a 2 hour trip. Does poor job of finding smaller roads. Recently used a friends Garmin Nuvi along side the Tom Tom. Garmin did a much better job at the 2 things mentioned earlier.. 

$$;
Pros:. This GPS is not totally useless as it does it does map out how to reach a destination but does not vocalize it. You might as well look at a map as look at this gps device.. 
Cons:. Any manufacturer that does not include such a basic feature as vocalizing a street name in all its gps models, obviously does not have its customers' in mind.. 
Summary:. Do your research and find a better quality product.. 

$$;
Pros:. none at all. 
Cons:. you have to down load maps to find out there are no new streets that was on the old version one. then be told there is no refund.. 
Summary:. i use this for work and depend on it it cheaper to buy a street map or use map quest or yahoo maps. then wast your money on there updates. lol what updates only think i seen differant was the grafices wow what kind od gas staion you are passing. 

$$;
Pros:. I liked the colors that is it. 
Cons:. It did not work forme at all. I wsa very happy to buy it and it would have gotten me lost in my own neighborhood, if I didn't know any better.. Told me my girlfriend did not live in the town I punched in. 
Summary:. Bottom line is that It did not work for me at all. When I told it I wanted to go home it wanted to take me in the wrong direction many miles out of the way.. It is a good thing I tested on the paces I knew because I would have gotten lost.. I did allow it to go its own way once and it took me miles frommy destination.. If you want to change direction it keeps telling you to turn around this is not good in case you hit a road block it doesn't tell yhou fast enough an alternate route.. Sometimes the voice toldmetogoleftwhen the arrow pointed right. This machine was all screwed up. On my way home from a friends house it told me there was no possible route??. then how did I get there :). Updated. on Apr 30, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. showes the speed limit and how fast you are going displays gas stations. 
Cons:. you can see the roads on the map but the divice is unable to navigate to them. 
Summary:. I have recently moved to arizona and i thought i gps was something good to have to drive around find places and not get lost and makes it easy for me to get back to where i live i bought the Garmin nuvi 200 it wasn't a bad device it gave me the best ways around except it couldn't locate my address for some reason i didn't think of finding updates so i returned it and got the Tomtom one 125 it located my address at first but couldn't locate anything else i updated the deivice it wouldn't even locate my address anymore there wass this cross roads feature but it keep giving me addresses an hour away from where i am even thou i typt in the zip codes i can see the streets on my screen right in front of me but the navagation wouldn't recognise them so i was so disapointed and just returned it and now looking for another one or maybe buying the garmin nuvi again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice sound, decent screen. 
Cons:. We had ours less than a week when the suction cup fell off the window and damaged the screen. Contacted Tom Tom and they told us since it wasn't warranty related we were out of luck as they didn't do repairs.. 
Summary:. We went and purchased a Magellan, it's much better than the Tom Tom.. 

$$;
Pros:. Highly legible touch screen. Solid windshield mount. Will get you to the destination. 
Cons:. Contrary to documentation, cannot get live traffic feed. Don't count on the generated route to be either fastest or shortest but it will get you to your destination.. It can take an hour to reacquire position if it looses GPS signal unless you stop.. 
Summary:. Don't buy a TomTom product unless you have seen all features that you plan to use demonstrated on the actual model you are buying. In my case, the package and online documentation was wrong. TomTom support response was only that the TomTom One 125 will not pair with a BT phone even though the documentation says it will for traffic updates. I now have a GPS that won't do what it was purchased to do, even though I read the documentation..
