in conclusion , this hotel is a great place to stay in the centre of shanghai , however , the staff need to receive a bit more training on customer service as they make you feel unwelcome and as if you were doing them a favour .
- even after checking in , our key didnt work and they looked at me as if i were crazy and did t know how to use it , even after the maid had also tried and failed .
we had a pleasant stay here , although it has to be said that the front desk staff could be more polite and more efficient .
- whilst the hotel is located near the bund , it is between metro stops , meaning that the closest metro station is a good 20 minutes walk .
- the shower screen hadnt been cleaned properly , again , something simple that makes a huge difference in appearance .
negatives : - check in process was slow , we had to wait about 20 minutes and they didnt seem to be very bothered .
- central location , just a short walk fro the bund and its amazing views .
we asked for a city view room and we were located on the 25th floor with great views over the city .
if i were worming at the hotel , i would publicise this a bit more .
when speaking with another customer who frequented the hotel , he said it had been like this for ages .
