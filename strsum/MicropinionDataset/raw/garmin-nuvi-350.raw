$$;
Pros:. fast acquisition, fast re routing, awesome features. 
Cons:. nothing. It's worked flawlessly. 
Summary:. I have the job of testing products before my company buys for all the techs and I tried every major brand and model over a 3 month period. For the features we needed (no blue tooth required) it beat all the others. TomTom had some close models but often placed locations on the wrong side of the street. Garmin 350 never routed me wrong and worked flawlessly. If you're on the fence about which GPS to by, get this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have a long commute and this ensures that I do not miss my exits, with ample warning, and is w/out a doubt something that has changed my driving more than anything since I got my license in '80.. 
Cons:. Wish that the suction cup would not be impacted by the cold in the winter.. 
Summary:. This product we purchased for my in-laws for their anniversary, and when we borrowed it to go to a ski resort later than year, the performance of it was so good that we went out and bought one immediately. It even took us the correct route down mountain roads, etc. Really is a revolutionary way to drive, especially for me not having been from Boston before we moved here from Miami..

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, great maps. 
Cons:. Haven't found any yet. 
Summary:. From the other reviews I read I disagree with the negatives they brought up. 1. The non qwerty keyboard is not a problem, you will not be using this for typing and as long as you completed grade school you will know the alphabet. 2. Can't enter a zip code. obviously the person didn't read the manual on PG 7 it says you can enter a postal code instead of a city. 3. It's expensive. Not anymore Buydig.com has it for $350 with free shipping. 4. The screen does not scroll smoothly. Who cares you are supposed to be driving not watching the screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. Made my European vacation. Will not leave home without it.. 
Cons:. Nothing wrong except the price of the additional software for Europe.. 
Summary:. My wife and I traveled via car through Southern Spain and then walked Venice, Italy in May of 2007. We purchased the European software and was glad we did. We would have been lost many times had we not had our pocket size GPS. It handled the traffic circles very accurately and worked well in the cities while walking in narrow streets and tall buildings. Satellite aquisitons were fast.. Just cannot say enough how much we enjoy using this device at home and while traveling. Give one confidence to take on areas where you never been before...great investment...will never regret this purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent routing. 
Cons:. Occasional minor out-of-the-way routing, but not an error.. 
Summary:. My brother-in-law used a DeLorme/Laptop combo, while I used the Nuvi 350 for a 300 mile trip from NJ to VA. He got lost, I didn't. Enough said. I've owned it almost a year, It's great!.

$$;
Pros:. Nice screen, easy to use, feature rich. 
Cons:. None in my opinion. 
Summary:. I purchased a Nuvi 350 at my local Target for $249 and I just love it. It is so easy to use and just works really well.. The GPS mapping is great, the voices loud and clear and the fact that it can actually say the street names is cool.. The travel assistant features are very useful. I purchased the Language Guide, Fodor's USA Travel Guide and the Saver's Guide SD cards and they are great.. The MP3 player works nice and I like how I can just sit the unit next to my desk at work and listen to my music through the units speaker.. The GPS receiver is very sensitive using the latest chipset. I can lock on to satellites inside even at my home or at my office.. The included accessories are very useful and the custom fitting leather case (included) is a very nice touch.. This is one really cool little device that I never leave home without. I highly recommend it. Only a couple of years back it was $1000 and now you can pick them up for $249. What a deal..

Pros:. Everything!. 
Cons:. Nothing as of yet. 
Summary:. For eight years now, I have owned the Garmin Etrex Legend. I still love that little GPS, but with all the new and improved units available, I wanted to get something new. So the first place I went to check out the new units, was CNET.com. After checking out the user ratings for Tom Tom, Magellan, and all the others, I decided to go with the same brand I had already.. The first thing I did when I took my Nuvi 350 out of the box, was to connect my Nuvi 350 to my PC, and go to Garmin.com to download the Web Updater program. This program automatically detects the current software version on any Garmin GPS, and will update the software if a new version is available. This eliminates any mistake in downloading the wrong software version. Besides some of the problems that a few people were complaining about in some of the really bad reviews were corrected with the new updates. Garmin is the only company I know of that Continually updates, and improves the GPS software on the units that have already been sold. This allows their customers to continually reap the benefits of fixed problems, and new features without having to buy a new GPS.. Once the software was updated, I was shocked at how easy this unit is to use. Once you turn it on, it gets a satellite lock within 30 sec., and your ready to go. I have yet to lose the satellite lock while driving around. This is the only GPS I have ever seen that acquired a Satellite lock inside a house away from a window. Needless to say I'm not worried about driving threw trees, or next to high rise buildings with this unit.. I have had my Garmin Nuvi 350 now for 4 days. I have taken it all the way to San Francisco and back, and it hasn't skipped a beat. This is the most accurate GPS I have ever seen. The Address search is accurate to within a house or two, which is better than a few I have heard of. The Points Of Interest are pretty well up to date, but no GPS is going to be 100% perfect in that regard. The Text to Speech on the Nuvi is very understandable, and has a verity of different languages. English has 3 different voices in itself. I like "Jill"! The Nuvi announces turns in advance, giving you plenty of time to prepare for it. The touch screen is extremely accurate, and easy to function. The display changes from a Day setting that has several different colors showing the surrounding area, to the Night setting at sunset that makes everything Black except for the roads. This really makes the Roads pop out at night. Some reviews said that the Nuvi 350 does not tell the elevation. In fact the Nuvi 350 does. If you touch the signal meter at the top left corner on the menu page, it will display the satellite-tracking page. On this page you will see the Satellite strength, and the elevation. Another review said you could not input a coordinates to find a place. In fact under the Where to? Menu you can do this as well.. A really cool feature is the fact you can copy your MP3's to a SD memory card that fits into the side of the unit, and play your favorite music while you drive. For a better sound I hooked up a FM modulator to the earphone jack on the side of the Nuvi. This way I can listen to my music, and when I am approaching a turn, the Nuvi will pause the music, and announce the directions, and then start the music where it left off. One more thing about the Memory card, if you get a card larger than 512 MB, say a 2 GB. Like I did, be sure to save your MP3's into separate files on the card no larger than 512 MB. Each. If you don't after you reach 512 MB on the card, it will stop accepting any more MP3's. I sat there for 10 Minutes scratching my head until I realized what happened. This will not affect the play list; it will display all your MP3s in the play list.. The Nuvi comes with a suction window mount that works great. It is tight, and very reliable. I live in California, and according to Garmin it is illegal to use this style mount here. Yesterday I passed several CHP officers, and even rode next to a CHP motorcycle for about 20 miles; he just looked over and smiled. Im sure he was admiring my Nuvi 350 placed just below my rearview mirror, so Im not too worried about that.. When you open the box, you will get the Garmin Nuvi 350, the Window mount, a adhesive backed disk for your dash (if you want, or need it), DC car adaptor, AC adaptor, a USB cable, a fitted Leather protective case for the Nuvi 350, quick start guide, Garmin lock guide, and a yellow paper that has the unit serial number, and registration code. The Yellow paper you defiantly want to keep. You need it to register your Nuvi, and it Entitles you to what is called a unlock code. This unlock code will entitle you to a base map update when it comes out in the future.. Now just a couple words of advise. Other than the software updates, be sure to enable the WAAS / EGNOS feature in the Settings / System menu. This makes the unit more accurate, and will not lose the satellite lock as easy. Also be sure to enable the Avoidances option under the Settings / Navigation menu. This allows you to select if you want to avoid Traffic, U-Turns, Highways, Unpaved Roads, Toll Roads, or Ferries. A couple reviews said that their Nuvi 350 kept telling them to make U-Turns; my guess is they never set the Avoidances. Also if you would like a tone to alert you that the Nuvi is about to speak, under Settings / Navigation menu, turn on the Attention Tone.. Eight years ago I paid $289.99 for my Garmin Etrex Legend. Needless to say, at $399.99 this is the best current GPS I have found for the money!. If anything happens in the future positive or negative, I will be sure to list it here.. Jimmy.

Pros:. perfect size, features, accuate. 
Cons:. nothing at all. 
Summary:. This navi is great. Touch screen is wonderfull. They really put a lot of thought into this one.....

Pros:. It's not just a GPS. It is a personal travel assistant.. 
Cons:. Don't know of any.. 
Summary:. Light. Bright. Fast. Easy to mount. Even easier to dismount and stick in console out of sun. Intelligently designed. WOOT!! Go buy it or you might regret it!. http://www.garmin.com/products/nuvi/. 

$$;
Pros:. large touch screen, Small GPS system not bulky at all, Easy to use. 
Cons:. I have yet to find a real defect. 
Summary:. If you are intrested in buying a GPS system and you have never had one before this is the system for you. It have simple and to the point navigation and is ready to use right out of the box. After aquiring it from Circuit City I opened the box read 4 a good 3 min. and it navigated me home. Ive seen this GPS for a very low price at Sams Club actually a good 100 dollars below the prices given here in Cnet. I highly recomend it its a great piece of technology.. 

$$;
Pros:. Grade A quality, portable, very ACCURATE. 
Cons:. battery life is not the best but gets the job done. 
Summary:. PROS:. First let me tell you that I am very picky with what I buy, and when I buy something I want to know that it is going to last me a long time and up to date in technology. The nuvi is well worth the money. I am a very very very very bad with directions, I get lost about everywhere I go. The nuvi has gotten me where I needed to go and showed me ways I never new existed. One example of how great this thing is when I went to the beach this past summer I ended up having to drive home alone. The nuvi got me where I needed to go and allowed you to choose detours for gas or food. I was coming home and needed gas I selected a detour and was able to choose from multiple gas stations based on my current distance. It even tells you the names of the gas stations so if you are using a gas card. But towards the end of the trip coming home I ended up in bumper to bumper traffic. I mean 20mins to drive 10 ft. I decided to try something which ended up saving hours off my trip due to traffic. This thing has a little feature which allows you to avoid high-ways and use rural roads. I tried this little thing out and got off the first exit I could in a town I had no idea been in before. This sucker got me back into my city by taking every back road there was and I was amazed when I saw how fast I got home. The nuvi also can be used as hand held. This feature also was great. I go into Washington DC quite often and get lost every single time. This sucker allowed me to save the location I parked my car before my night out in the town and got me back to my car while walking with it. This thing is great. I own a pawn shop and have experience with many gps and thought wow these things are great until I discovered what the nuvi does. I totally recommend buying a nuvi.. 

$$;
Pros:. This device is very user friendly &#38; simple to use. Very accurate easy to see, yet small enough to put in your pocket (not bulky). 
Cons:. Audio could stand to be improved &#38; there are some locations (restaurants, retail, etc.) that need to be updated.. 
Summary:. We recently put it to the test on a cross country trip to Southern California. We didn't use any maps. It did an outstanding job telling us when to turn &#38; navigating around L.A. (yikes!) But it performed perfectly.. My wife was originally skeptical, but soon was quite impressed. I loved it because this was the first trip where we weren't fighting over maps &#38; blaming each other for missing turns. I found this at PCnation.com for $597 no tax &#38; free shipping.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent design, ease of use, compactness, touch screen. 
Cons:. Some software updates deletes all your saved locations. 
Summary:. I purchased this unit in June'06 in preparation for a road trip from Long Island to Toronto. I did extensive research on other units. What I liked was its design, compactness, ease of use &#38; touch screen feature. I did not want a unit with any buttons to push in order to use the navigation feature. From my trip I was basically blown away with the many features &#38; the unit's performance. I never got lost, I got the best routes (whether scenic or fastest) which made my trip totally stress free. I also used the unit to navigate the streets of downtown Toronto as a pedestrian and I was able to locate restaurants and points of interests. Basically I was able to plan my foot excursions using the unit @ the hotel. The touch screen is amazing and was easy to use when driving. The screen was bright enough even when the sunlight was blaring down on the unit. The only downside to the unit I discovered is that some of the software updates clears the unit of previous saved locations which can be a nuisance. The most recent software update for the update tool (Sept'06) supposedly will promt you that saved locations will be erased. I can't evaluate this as there have been no software updates for the actual unit since then. That being said, I have recommended that unit to my family, friends &#38; co-workers. It's a great safety feature, saves you lots of precious time and you get the excellent benefits of portability. Why spend $1,500 on a car manufacturer's navi system that sits in your car?. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, portable and fast gps updates. 
Cons:. was not available before i bought a terrible magellan unit. 760. 
Summary:. I owned a magellan 700 that quit soon after purchase. The factory would not repair it so i replaced it with a magellan 760. The 760 was worse than the 700. Customer support at Magallan is nonexistant. I would never buy another product from them.. The Garmin 350 is so simple to use and set up my wife can use it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast update timing, calculates routes fast and correctly, and can zoom in on your location super close. 
Cons:. None to my knowledge, a bit expensive, but also worth it.. 
Summary:. This is the first GPS I've owned personally, but have over the past year been comparing GPS systems I wanted to get for my truck aince I like to do a lot of traveling. The GPS system I've used the most was the one in my dad's Acura TSX, which even though it has a larger screen, was not able to move home in on your location as close as the Nuvi 350 is able to. When I'm driving it automatically displays at the top of the screen the next cross street that I am about to cross, which is really nice to have, especially when the street sign is covered by a tree. I for a test put in to calculate a route from my home in California to a friend's home in Minnesota; the route was calculated and telling me where to go in under 30 seconds! It's small and compact so It'll be perfect to bring hiking or bike riding when I want to and not have to lug around a big device that I can't fit in my pocket. Overall, I would recommend this GPS to anyone who is looking for one, and can afford the $799+tax price tag.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, lightweight, great screen, all controls are touchscreen, SD card. 
Cons:. No cons to report. 
Summary:. This is by far the best GPS I've had the chance to use. It comes with a long lasting lithium battery and travel case that fits right into your pocket.. The Screen: I have it set to auto detect day and night mode. Both modes are clearly visible and there is absolutely no sun glare during the day. The touchscreen controls are dead on.. GPS: Extremely accurate and acquires the satellites quickly upon initial startup. I have never lost a signal and signal strength is unbelievably strong.. Updates: Very quick to download software updates via Garmin's web site and the updates take less than a few minutes via the USB connector. Map upgrades are a little costly though at about $75, but should not need to update those too often.. POI Loader: Definitely get the free POI loader from Garmin's web site! Works great to upload custom POIs you find on the net and to create your own POIs.. This unit was so easy I took it out of the box when I got it home and had it mounted in the vehicle and ready to go within minutes.. This is honestly the best piece of electronics equipment I have purchased. We do a lot of camping, and this unit has proven to be well worth the money! When we are at a camping location and are looking for points of interest, you just look it up, select it, hit GO and you are on your way.. I really cannot praise this unit enough and I am what you would call a power user and find the faults in this kind of equipment quickly and I can say, this unit has no faults!. Do yourself a favor if you are looking for a GPS and just go after this one, you will not be disappointed at all!. 

$$;
Pros:. VERY EASY TO USE. 
Cons:. I HAVENT FOUND ANY. 
Summary:. I GOT THIS UNIT ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO, I USE IT FOR BUSINESS AS WELL AS PLEASURE AND IMUST SAY AFTER DOING MY HOMEWORK ON GPS, I HAVE FOUND THIS THE BEST UNT AVAILABLE YET.FOR ONE GARMIN IS THE LEADER IN GPS TECHNOLGY THE UNIT IS VERY EASY TO DO UPDATES ON YOUR COMPUTER FROM THE GARMIN WEB SITE..ONCE YOU REGISTER YOUR UNIT WITH THEM THEY LET YOU KNOW WHEN UPDATES ARE AVAILABLE. IT DOEST GET ANY EASIER THEN THAT, THE MAPS AND STREET NAMEING VOICE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FABULOUS.......I THINK YOU WILL FIND THIS THE FINEST UNIT ON THE MARKET AS I HAVE. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, accurate, and above all convenient. 
Cons:. Plastic casing feels cheap. 
Summary:. As someone who has always been directionally challenged, my Nuvi 350 has been a lifesaver. It is especially helpful in Boston, where it is easy to get maddeningly lost even when you have a map. When travelling, it gives me the peace of mind of never having to hunt down a restaurant, gas station, movie theater, etc.. I don't think I've ever been as satisfied with any consumer electronic product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, display is easy to read, POI database, VERY quick recalculation.. 
Cons:. May not always give the fastest route through cities (DC) but will get you where you need to go.. 
Summary:. I bought the Nuvi from Shipdog (great merchant) on Thursday and received it on Monday-right before a trip from DC to upstate New York. The unit was excellent. It didn't miss a beat the entire trip and allowed me to find exits (some hidden) that otherwise would have been missed.. The small size definitely works-I had it mounted by the rearview mirror and would glance at it every so often to see what type of turn was coming up ahead. Because the screen is so clear, it took a split second to figure out what I had to do next and it wasn't any more distracting than checking a side or rearview mirror.. Very good at gauging speed and giving the next direction when you are 30 seconds away, and then repeating it when you are closer.. The "travel guide" features (mp3 player, language translator, etc.) are nice to have. The sound quality of the speaker when listening to music is okay, but that's not why I bought the system in the first place. It's clear when it's giving me directions-that's what counts.. Adding "Via Points" is simple as well. Once you set your destination, push the menu button and put in a new address/destination. Once you click on "Go" it will ask you if you want to enter it as a "Via Point". Select "yes" and you're set to go. We did this with Breezweood, PA on our way North.. The database is also pretty robust. While going, we saw signs for an outlet mall. Coming back, we realized we didn't know the particular name of the mall, so we entered the first store we saw remembered seeing from the highway "J.Crew" the Nuvi found it in the database right away and we set it up as a Via Point. We were there within minutes!. The mount is easy to transfer from car to car and the battery life seems pretty good so far. The text-to-speech option is great in a city where you can't constantly look at the GPS and the road trying to figure out the names of upcoming streets when you're told to turn.. The recalculation feature works very quickly. When I got close to home, I took a different way than was suggested and the Nuvi was very quick to try to get me back on track.. On my trip, I spent 8 hours driving each way and didn't have to stress about "Do I turn left or right here?" or wondering "is the next turn coming up soon?" or worse, "Did I already pass my exit?". This system was definitely worth it! I spent alot of time researching GPS systems before deciding on the Nuvi. Before it arrived, I saw alot of ads for less expensive systems and started second-guessing my decision to splurge. That all stopped as soon as I plugged it in and took my first trip with it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, Accurate tracking. 
Cons:. none at present. 
Summary:. As I have had a previous GPS unit in a Navigator I had some doubts about the size of this unit. Having used it for a week it is not a problem. The screen is easy to read. It locks on quickly. It is very simple as I had my 10 year daughter search for a Cracker Barrel and located without difficulty. If you miss a turn it recalculates your route very fast. Being able to update via computer is also a huge advantage. I got the 350 as I do not want bluetooth. Highly recommended.. 

$$;
Pros:. Loaded with features in a very small package. 
Cons:. Some minor software clitches. 
Summary:. I have owned GPS units and have one built into my car but I travel a lot and was tired of paying for GPS enabled rental cars. I did a lot of comparisons with Magellan and Tom Tom units as well as other Garmin models. I am so pleased I chose the Nuvi 350.. Its directions are accurate, its many methods of selecting destinations are easy to use, and its many additional features (language translation, MP3 player, Audible book player, Picture viewer, etc.) are actually useful. I frequently drive long distances in rental cars and its great to have the GPS features and listen to an audio book.. I was very impressed when soon after registering my unit, I received an email from Garmin telling me that an update to the Nuvi's system ROM was just released. Sure enough, I followed the link and quickly updated the system which gave the unit several new features. Most glitzy (and perhaps least useful) is the ability to select the color and appearance of the respresentation of YOU on the map (from the usual pointer all the way to a Big Foot 4x4).. Problems I've noted:. - extraneous nonsense and duplicate entries appearing in my Saved Favorites list.. - when you enter a destination and the GPS is off, the system asks if you want to simulate a drive to the destination. If you say yes, it starts simulating -- except that it often gets lost! Good thing this doesn't happen when the GPS is actually working.. It has an interesting feature that lets you set the type of vehicle you are in including pedestrian/bicycle, car, bus, emergency vehicle, etc. I'm not sure what all the setting do but I know that I once left it in pedestrian mode by mistake when I was asking it to find the best route to the airport. Several things happened: First, the route it chose basically had me turning left after one block, right after the next, left after then next, etc. It also told me it would take about 8 hours to get to my destination. I was puzzled until I started driving and, presumably after reaching a driving speed too fast to be walking, the Nuvi came up with a message on the screen saying something like: "You are currently in pedestrian mode, would you like to change to car?" When I hit Yes, it recalculated and we were off. Well done!. This is a great unit. Now if it had an 8 megapixel camera and a video player in it, I could get rid of most of the gadgets in my briefcase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightweight, and full of features.. 
Cons:. Price (but worth it) and slow delivery on add on's.. 
Summary:. I have owned this model for three months and it continues to impress me(I have owned four different mfg models before this one). It calculates very quickly, it is accurate, and it is so small and portable that I carry everywhere I go. I am very pleased with my purchase!. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Lightweight, Preloaded maps, mp3 play, photoviewer, accurate and up to date maps, touchscreen. 
Cons:. Non qwerty keyboard. 
Summary:. I had a Cobra Nav One 3000 for a couple of years and it was a decent gps. However, it weighed almost two pounds with it's windshield mount. It also was slow....very slow.....to pick up satellites. This Garmin Nuvi 350 is ssssooooooo tiny and lightweight. It is so small that I actually mount it to my windhshield behind and to the left of my rearview mirror. It also picks up satellites and knows your current position in less than 15 seconds. The software is most likely the newest available. I paid $200 for CoPilot Live for my pocket pc to discover that the maps used for that software are over 3 or 4 years old. We live in a 2.5 year old housing development and our streets are included in the Nuvi software. Also, I go through a small roundabout on my way to work every day. The Cobra and CoPilot Software never recognized this roundabout although it has been there for 5 years. I figured no big deal because it is a minor detail. This Nuvi recognizes the roundabout!!! While I have not used the MP3 player or photoviewer, it is nice to know that the Nuvi can do that also should I need to use it in the future. I am continuously amazed with this GPS system and will most likely be using it for quite a long time. I would be amazed if a company released anything better than this anytime soon...I cannot imagine what could be better.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, accurate, feature rich. 
Cons:. Directions can be inaccurate on some side streets. 
Summary:. I've had the Nuvi for some time now. I've used it to drive from LA to Minnesota to Key West. It has been a life saver! I used it to find hotels, food and other points of interest the entire way - I didn't need a single paper map! My car even broke down in FL and I was able to contact the nearest dealership, get a tow and be on my way the very same day. The only problem I have had is that it sometimes gives crazy directions from point A to point B. I wish you were able to define specific roads/sections of roads you would like to avoid. There are only general parameters you can set for calculating the route. Overall, a great navagation device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Garmin nuvi 350 delivers what's promised. It's very accurate and very good person assistant you would get. 
Cons:. Suction mount works well but the GPS mount point with the suction holder should be made tight. 
Summary:. Folks,. This is one of the best high-tech gadget you would ever see in the market. It's a fantastic GPS whis is easily mountable and portable as well. The speed at which it recalculates the directions is awesome. It's highly accurate and is also rich in features.. I have just used it for 2 days and I want it use it everyday. I should have brought this product a long time ago if it was available.. It's accurate to about 10 feet to 27 feet depending the number of satellites gets locked in. I can't believe that this GPS locks even inside my house.. Don't get deceived by Nuvi's size and it's worth every penny you spend for it.. Sundar.

Pros:. LETS DRIVER KNOW WHAT LANE TO BE IN. 
Cons:. NEED GARMINS HELP ON UPDATEING SOFTWARE VERSION. 
Summary:. I recently took a trip down to san antonio texas to visit my son in the air force. I rented a car and pluged the nuvi 350 in. Wow it took me all over texas with out any problems. This little unit is incredible it will tell you witch lane to be in before you exit or enter a ramp. If you miss a turn it will recalculate a new course. I did a lot of research on GPS units a this is the best on the market. thanks mr Fowler. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Portable, Configurable, Good Screen, Extras are Great. 
Cons:. Add-ons are expensive. 
Summary:. Bought this on eBay new and couldn't be happier. This unit has everything you need with text-to-voice, clear screen, good audio, good add-ons, reasonable price, easy updates (via internet), comes with good accessories (suction mount works great).. The down side is that the add-ons that take the unit to the next level (savercard and traffic avoidance antenna system) are expensive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Robust Maps, Simple Screens, Updatable firmware, Innovations, my POIs, BATTERY!. 
Cons:. Don't see that it can: trip previews (view on map), planning multiple waypoints, ,. 
Summary:. I am writing today because I just made my purchase so don't have in hand. When I do I will update this review.. First, I appreciate those who commented below as they have been instrumental in my decision to buy this product. Other than $$$ you will not find much negative on this equipment.. I would also suggest that others review sites such as Epinions and GPSPassion and http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/garmin_nuvi_350_insanely_recommended.php. When making a purchase like this you need all the info you can get!. Background: this unit is for my wife who travels by car around Atlanta. So we are interested in map details, ease of use, portability between vehicles, text to speech, and battery operated. We have used Neverlost in a rental car but this is our first GPS purchase.. I have spent ~ 100 hours researching online, reading operating manuals, and visiting stores to see units in operation. The only store that seems to be helpful is Circuit City, if you can get a sales person to take the unit outside. That is a revealing experience, especially when the unit can't find its location or my home address!. Originally I focused on BIG screen units but after reading that you go more by voice then I started looking at the ease of use and robust nature of maps. My acid test was seeing if the unit could locate my home address. That was revealing in a negative way.. Then I started seeing long comments about Satellite acquisition. One problem was that some cars have window coatings which interfer with the signals. I found that other X-5 owners have no problem with this. The Nuvi uses a new technology chip set and some report that it works on the seat! That would be a plus for not having to have it so visibly with a mounting. More on this later..... Have not decided to spring for the FM traffic input. It is so new and little light on its accuracy and timeliness.. You have probably noticed a consistent pricing. I was able to find a site with a $799 price and snapped it up at that price this AM. It appears that Garmin jumps on these folks like a cat on a mouse to set the price at $899. My vendor was back in the fold by Noon today! I read of another vendor site where the same thing happened. Auctions appear to be the only place to do better on $$$ for now.. For those who like not reading the manual, I suggest you do that as there are features you will never find any other way. How do you take a screen shot for example?. Adding POIs seems to be interesting. If you go to the GPSPassion site you will see the beginning of an attempt to organize this effort. It is a way for us users to help each other. All Friendly Ice Cream Stores, Flying J Truck stops, some speed traps, and hot springs (1700+) are there for downloading.. More later.... 

$$;
Pros:. Text to speech directions, extremely accurate. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. I just got this product a week back and was thrilled by its simplicity and ease of use...boy..,,was it accurate....I mean I could not believe it...mp3 player works awesome and u can connect it to ur car stereo using FM transmitter and play it through ur car speakers which is a another unique feature of this model....dont forget to get a free software upgrade when u buy this product from garmins website... its so cool..(may be $100 extra but u get wht u pay for).... awesome is the word. 

$$;
Pros:. Good size display, built-in bateries and speakers, stores MP3's and pictures... i love it. 
Cons:. None so far..... 
Summary:. I've already owned a car with a factory GPS in it and after getting rid of it, I purchased the StreetPilot 2720, which I kept for 2 days.. The sheer size of that device was a huge turnoff for me. Sometimes I am forced to leave my car in a less than desireable spot and the NUVI fits right in my shirt pocket. Whereas the 2720 was about the size of a brick and impossible to stash anywhere.. Anyway, I took the NUVI on a 150 mile trip, through NYC, Long Island and back. The device performed flawlessly.. I was able to listen to a PodCast that I transfered to its internal memory and whenever the NAV needed to guide me, the podcast would mute and the voice prompts would guide me. When the voice prompts were finished, the audio volume would return to where it was.. The device is small enough to not obstruct your vision, but the display is more than large enough to provide the guidance that you need to navigate the cluster of highways that all seem to merge together on NY highways.. The speed at which the device calculates and responds is impressive, as is the POI's that are in the system. Not only does it list the common POI's within 25 miles(food, fuel, atm's), just to test it, I entered Compusa and the damn thing knew where all of those were too !. I love this new toy of mine, you will too !. 

$$;
Pros:. Entertaining, decent perks for a GPS unit! Street names in the city make a world of difference.. 
Cons:. Semi-contradiction, but, the perks! I compared this with another popular Garmin model ,and likely, due to the lack of extras, the other unit was more accurate.... 
Summary:. I've made several trips to different states in the past, and did a good job with paper maps... I ONLY HAD TO STOP 4 TIMES on the average to regroup, (MEANS ASK FOR DIRECTIONS). Now even if I make a mistake, I am redirected in seconds. And it's not even noticeable! I bought the nuvi 350 about 2.5 years ago and it's been a true, wife approved, Gadget that I will probably never go without. I do admit though, I keep the non-perky GPS close by just in case! This is a great unit for keeping the kids entertained during long (even short) rides. The audio book and MP3 features are sure pluses!. 

$$;
Pros:. Gets signal faily quickly. Enjoyed how I can do a trip meter to see how much I traveled for overall GPS use.Gives numbers of resteraunts that I can call ahead &#38; make reservations. Loved the fact that I have quick mute function. Turn on time is short.. 
Cons:. Did not like lack of blue tooth. Wish I could have seperate trip meters including current trip along side average speed for current trip. Listening to music on the GPS was sub-par but then it's not a music player. Needs more languages options.. 
Summary:. Great GPS that I got my parents over 2 years ago. They love it ever since. Simple to use and now much cheaper than before. I recommend this GPS for the lower expence as well as higher money makers, if they are looking for total functionality.. Also if you can buy the bean bag, it stays on your car no problem and you can place it underneath to avoid theft. Note Don't buy the bean bag from Garmin as you have to buy 2 things seperatly and cost alot more than if you were to buy from ebay. Garmin is a good company but still has evil corparation method for extras.. 

$$;
Pros:. VERY compact , Bright Screen. 
Cons:. not cheap , battery life could be longer. 
Summary:. Faster location of the GPS satellites. This turns out to be quite important in day-to-day use. In the other systems, it wasn't unusual that we could be driving for a couple minutes before it located the satellites and could give us directions. With this unit, the satellites are located almost as quickly as the unit fully starts up.. One comment on how we use this: We don't mount it on the dash board or on the window (which is technically illegal here in California). Instead we just lay this on the center console in our van or car. The antenna system is plenty sensitive to work just like this and we've never lost the satellite signals except in tunnels.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, features. 
Cons:. Sometimes slow to acquire satellites. 
Summary:. I bought this unit prior to a recent family trip. After using it for just a few hours, my wife is completely enamored with it. I think I have lost it to her car.... Routing is not always optimum, but it is still a worthwhile tool And, while it originally picked a longer route than I normally take, a few hours into the trip it came up with a new routing option that matched what I originally mapped out.. I also was surprised when at sundown it changed over to night mode. This is just another nice feature that is enabled by default.. I have a kid going off to college this fall and plan to give him the 350 for his birthday. I will feel much better knowing it will help him around the city.. 

$$;
Pros:. small, bluetooth, great features. 
Cons:. have not found one. 
Summary:. I am surprised how often I use the Bluetooth for hands free mobile calls. The maps are great for me in Northern VA. There was one intersection in San Diego earlier this year that hadn't been updated, but that's all I have found. I love this thing and my kids love it when Karen (the Aussie) tells us where to go, but they really love to know how long it will be until we get there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate and Compact with plenty of P.O.I.'s. 
Cons:. None noted!. 
Summary:. My wife, our three children and I recently took a much needed three day weekend get-away (April 2008). We are from the Chicago, IL. area and wanted to get out of the city. We planned a trip for the Osthoff Resort in Elkhart Lake, WI. (great place by the way). This was our first 2 to 3 hour car trip as a family and the mapquest directions were a bit cumbersome and confusing. I borrowed my Dad's Nuvi 350 for the trip and cannot believe I haven't purchased one of these handy little guys yet.. I mounted the Nuvi 350 to my van's windshield with the convenient mount included. The box also came with a dashboard mount for states that do not allow windshield mounts. It was nice that the windshield mount had a quick release button allowing me to quickly remove and store the unit in the included leather case and carry around in my shirt pocket, so that I didn't have to worry about it getting stolen. The mount had the power cable (for the cigarette lighter) built in and it connected to the Nuvi without a separate cable. The windshiled mount held tight and the unit stayed in place and was easy to move to my desired view on the ball-type pivot arm. It was nice and sturdy.. After mounting I conveniently did a search in this units's POI file for the Osthoff Resort; sure enough there it was 101 Osthoff Avenue. I could have also just entered the state, then city and finally the address and I would have got the same information. However, it was nice to see that it was already in Garmin's POI file and from my driveway with the loaded minivan I simply pressed go and we started our trip. I brought the Mapquest directions just in case, but I am happy to say I never needed to refer to them.. The Nuvi 350 gave us an estimated time of arrival, which adjusted itself depending on my speed and/or stops. By the time the trip was complete we arrived within seven minutes of the estimated time the unit originally first gave us. Needless to say, I was very impressed never using a GPS before and this being a little over a two and a half hour ride.. I found the units volume, which I set to about three-fourths of the max to be more than appropriate. It doesn't have an external volume control, but the on-screen menu with a simple two touches of the screen worked easily to set volume. The adjustable brightness was more than adequate both in the day and at night (the unit has an auto day/night screen setting option, which worked great or you can manually set the screen to day or night if you want).. Directions were flawless through northern Illinois and Wisconsin. All of the roads were there and the directions spot-on. There was one tricky spot through Milwaukee where I would have missed the correct path if using printed directions. I trusted the Nuvi 350 and went with what it told me to do and it got me through without a problem. The text-to-speech feature "actually saying the street name" was a nice touch and I found the synthesized voice to be clear and understandable.. We ended our trip with the Nuvi 350 taking us right to the front entrance of the Osthoff Resort, which is a large resort with three expansive wings (the property is equivalent to about ten city blocks). I was glad just to get there, but to get us within ten feet of the front entrance was impressive!. While we were there for the weekend we used the Nuvi 350 to find a local Walmart, a gas station, a cheese store (you can't just go to Wisconsin without buying some of their excellent cheeses) and an antique's store. The unit got us to each of these places and back to the resort effortlessly, even at night with the all of the unlit country back roads! It was a pleasure driving. There were plenty of choices built into the POI file and it was easy to use. Everything from gas stations to food and lodging at your fingertips.. So, there you have it. If my review doesn't show you my personall feelings for the Nuvi 350, then I didn't do a good enough job describing my experience. I did not have any negative experiences with this unit. I just ordered my own today (05-04-08) online from Wal-mart after shopping around a few days and found them to have the best price.. I hope this review is helpful in your decision making! Good Luck!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen -Loud,clear turn by turn directions. 
Cons:. should be able to update maps for free. 
Summary:. Picked this baby up from Ebay for $175 and fell in love.Very simple to use, I really like the Home feature that gets you back from anywhere with a couple quick pushes on the screen.The search feature is also very useful on the road. Hotels, food, ATMs, shopping, gas, you name it! Use the usb cable to download new vehicle icons from Garmins garage.My only complaint would be that you should be able to update the maps for free.I was using Microsoft Streets and trips but this is way better and safer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, idiot proof, portable, expandable memory. 
Cons:. no bluetooth, poor battery life when using on foot. 
Summary:. I bought this when it first hit the market a few years ago. It has come down in price a LOT. I am looking to upgrade within the next year or so. I am probably sticking with Garmin based on my history with this unit. It has been worth its weight in gold for me as a sales rep with a 4 state territory. I can't imagine doing my job without a good gps. I am going for one with a larger screen and bluetooth next time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quickly recalculates for missed turns. 
Cons:. Add ons too expensive and impractical. 
Summary:. I have many stories of getting myself lost and going to great lengths to find my way home. I haven't tried any other GPS unit, but I know for a fact that this one gets the job done. I wish the FM transmitter was more practical as it would be very useful for avoiding traffic. Detouring could be better as once you detour from a main road, the Nuvi 350 will not take you back on that road, at least it hasn't in my experience.. 

$$;
Pros:. The simplicity, any first time GPS owner can use the 350.. 
Cons:. The extras that you will pay for that aren't really necesary.. 
Summary:. I really have nothing bad to say about the Garmin Nuvi 350! From the simplicity of mounting the 350 to your windshield to the way the features are accesed and used the 350 in my eyes is the best GPS out there. Sometimes when you buy something you wish that you would have purchased a different model either for the features or price. You won't have to worry about wanting a different GPS unit! This little slice of heaven will get you where you want to go and back without getting lost!! It gives you plenty of time to turn your turn signal on and make your turn without having to hit the brakes and still miss your turn. Even if for some reason you miss your turn, don't worry, the 350 will get you back on the right road with little effort. No more maps, the wife screaming in your ear wondering what was driving her car and why it wasn't listening or that hopeless feeling of, where am I? Oh, by the way, instead of listening to an irate person screaming in your ear you can simply tap the screen and listen to a soothing English Lass or for the Females, an Aussie gently guiding you home. No need for a money back guarrantee with the 350. I'm sure you will fall in love with it!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple, but powerful interface, customizability, satellite status screen, sensitive reception, tiny size, expandability. 
Cons:. Slow start-up, price. 
Summary:. First of all, if you are looking for a cheap device, this isn't it. However, I found that the first THREE devices I owned all had fatal flaws (poor sensitivity, impossible interface, poor route-making). I wasted money until I just sucked it up and got this one.. This device is dead accurate with rapid acquisition time (unless you are in Manhattan). However, start-up from a cold shut-down is time-consuming. You can lock the screen, but I haven't discovered a way to "sleep" the thing. There is also a nifty GPS status screen that shows the projected positions of the satellites overhead, and which ones your unit can see.. The interface is dead-easy with large buttons and fast response. However, because of the large buttons, each screen can only offer so many options and you have to do a lot of keystrokes. It beats a cluttered screen, though.. It's amazingly customizable. Not only does it speak the names of streets, but it allows you to choose its accent of speech. I personally like the Australian, but you can choose British or American English. You can also choose American vs. European Spanish. Same with French. You can download cute little icons to serve as your vehicle. Once, on a road trip, we made our icon into the pirate ship and watched our little ship ply the treacherous waters of I-80.. Route finding is solid, especially in convoluted New York City. I find that the device sometimes wants me to be on the service road next to the Bruckner Expressway when I want to be on the Expressway, though. Otherwise, it never gets lost.. It's not cheap. And if you want to upgrade to say, Europe, it's going to run you another $250 to buy that card. But the device is so fantastic that it's worth its weight in diamonds.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear directions; good additional data; easy to use.. 
Cons:. Boy, none that come to mind.. 
Summary:. For under $300.00 if you shop even a little, this is a GREAT buy. My wife now swears by it. We have college trips scheduled for my daughter this spring, and this little puppy will be leading us all over the eastern U.S. It couldn't be easier to use; the directions are clear (and helpful -- it gives you plenty of time/room to change lanes).. 

$$;
Pros:. User Friendly, providing error free Navigation, compact. 
Cons:. All minor, nothing worth mentioning. Lets not compare it with PDA as some wants to do it.... 
Summary:. A perfect basic all round GPS.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of Use. 
Cons:. Database could be updated more often. 
Summary:. Overall, I'm very happy with my Nuvi 350--the only real negative is the map database--it could be updated a little more often--I see streets/subdevelopments that are as old as 1 year yet they don't exist as far as my Nuvi is concerned.... Still happy I bought the 350 model [from Amazon about 6 months ago for $350--now I think they can be had for about $299]. 

$$;
Pros:. Very practical, small. easy and precise... 
Cons:. Stability of the unit when operating. 
Summary:. I have read other reviews... they didn't give their experiences.... I just returned from a 3760 mile trip (after a cruise).. The 350 was flawless.... even when I doubted it (looking at my printed PC directions) it came through... I really love this thing...by the way I plug it into my MP3 port (Ford F150) listen to the player...she mutes the music then returns it after giving directions through the system.. Since I have a lease vehicle I did'nt want to attatch it with the provided stands so it was somewhat cumbersome..until I used a Mp3 attatchment in the console cup holder... If I could get to that girl in there ...I would marry her.... 

$$;
Pros:. Small, portable and accurate. Lots of options to customize.. 
Cons:. Destination database is weak. Have to download manual.. 
Summary:. This is a great GPS. Got it for less than $300. Would not pay much more. Compared this to the Nuvi 260 and chose this one because of optional traffic alerts and other extras like an AC power cord. Though it is very intuitive to use right out of the box, I did find a few things in the manual. The 350 does have a quick way to access the volume (tap the power button), that is why there is no external dial. Lots of other shortcuts and hints (holding "back" takes you back to the main screen, etc.)that I would have never known about unless I read the manual. Many of the negative reviews I read may have been different if they could read. I guess people would rather complain than take 5 minutes to read the thing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Navteq Mapping and does a great job routing. 
Cons:. speaker isn't the best. 
Summary:. I've had the Garmin Nuvi 350 for a couple of months now and it was a great buy. For $295 from buydig.com, you get the best bang for your buck. Came with 2008 maps, secures easily and firmly to the windshield, and is small enough to put in my pocket to use on foot. If your a first time GPS buyer, this is the one to get!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Tons of options, small and sleek, and very easy to use right out of the box. 
Cons:. Slow in starting up, some streets are not up-to-date. 
Summary:. Overall, I love my Garmin Nuvi 350 GPS. I got it last May and I take it everywhere I go. I travel tons and it helps me get to where I need to go in any city I am in. I never had another GPS prior to this one but I find the load time when you start the GPS is kinda slow at times. But maybe all GPS are like that.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accuracy, Sensitivity, Maps, everything. 
Cons:. speaker and perhaps price. 
Summary:. I purchased this about this time last year. This past summer, I used it entirely for a 8600 mile trip from Ohio to CA/OR/WA using mostly Interstates but with local streets and roads in specific areas. Jill (the American voice) never led me wrong. The voice prompts were timed exactly right for upcoming turns. The only negative is the quality of the speaker when used for audiobooks or phone. If it's turned up full, the voice is distorted, if not turned up, it cannot be heard well.. One more thing, the nuvi is backed up with an excellent customer service team. Garmin always sounds like your question is the most important one that day.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy GUI, POI's are great, ver simple.. 
Cons:. No zipcode search - a minor omission.. 
Summary:. We purchased about 6 of these for our outside sales guys. I travel with mine several weeks of each month and I depend on the Nuvi to get me everywhere. There is an optional traffic module that I've read about and want to get to help me get places faster.. If some of the technically challenged folks in our senior management can use these then it's perfect for everyone!. 

$$;
Pros:. it works well, the text to speech is good that is what i love and it recalculates real quick. 
Cons:. speaker went out I think it was a defect. 
Summary:. I got this and I was so happy with it and it helped me out. I also found some restraunts that are not even listed in phonebook, so that was amazing.. But the only thing that happened was I had to return it because when I was coming back from Vegas, the speaker went out on me. But I think it was a defect just like any other product when it fails. So I had to return it and I didn't do an exchange I kept the money just because I got back from Vegas, and I obviously lost and Christmas is coming up.. But when I'm ready to buy again I will re-buy this GPS again for Sure. I love this Product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works everywhere - even NYC; can truly find the best route. 
Cons:. No external volume control and "agree" screen every time it's turned on.. 
Summary:. This was a gift for my tech-challenged and unenthusiastic husband in preparation for a long road trip. He had an opportunity to use it on a short trip to NYC and was thrilled when it easily got him to his hotel after being detoured off the highway outside the city. I then took it on a short trip to Seattle. It helped my mother and me find a charming coffee shop (Are there any other kind in Seattle?), a pharmacy, "the" market, and to my neice's home. Then I used it to find my way to a friend's new home. I was surprised that it took me one route there and another route home. After thinking about it I realized that even though it was a simple round trip with no side trips, each route was the best choice for the direction I was traveling. By the way - my father's car came with a nav system. Mum (who has just been introduced to computers at the age of 80) despises "that thing". But she loved the Nuvi350 so much, she asked me to order one for her.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, Accurate, Small Size. 
Cons:. Does not display remaining distance. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS purchase and I am loving it. I read it after going through user reviews on various websites and I have to admit most of them were on target.. I have been using Nuvi 350 for 2 weeks now and it has worked well on all occasions. It even had some rare and unexpected points of interest.. Only thing I can say this device really needs is 'Remaining Distance' and search the address by zip code instead of having to enter state and city. The device shows 'estimated time to arrival at destination' which has been fairly accurate. However, estimated distance remaining to the destination would have been awesome.... 

$$;
Pros:. size, speaks street names, easy to use. 
Cons:. small screen size, no external volume control, price. 
Summary:. This GPS device is my second one and it is perfect! I owned a Tom Tom G0 720. I had the Tom Tom for 8 months. I thought it was a quality device however, its size and difficulty of use made it frustrating for me. The size and weight made sure that it would fall off constantly from the windshield mount. The unit was not user freindly, did not come with a manual and I never mastered using it. The Garmin Nuvi-350 was so simple and easy to use right out of the box. I looked for a GPS with street speaking capabilities. I found this one for 349.99 on the web. Using Tom Tom without the street names created problems like coming to a turn right in 300 yards and there were 2 roads and one highway on-ramp all next to each other! I never did take the right road. With the Garmin, it tells you the street name and is programable. Putting in names of your favorite locations are spoken and it is a joy. Now my wife loves it and accepts it as her road guide. I never was able to find out if Tom Tom made a GPS that spoke street names, but I had no problem finding a Garmin that did and I am glad I bought it! I gave the Tom Tom to my son - he is more computer literate and is finding it fine for his first GPS. The Garmin also stays on the winshield because it is so light. I can also carry it with me on foot and use it. It fits right into my pocket.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use.. 
Cons:. Maps a bit outdated. Occasional errors regarding the side of the road that an address is on.. 
Summary:. I would definitely recommend it tyo a friend.. 

$$;
Pros:. small and compact. 
Cons:. Price is to high. 
Summary:. I bought this 350 in Miami where lives my son, and this 350 works outstanding where I live, in Puerto Rico.. 

$$;
Pros:. Announce street names, 3D view (not top down, but driving down the map), long battery life, MP3 player is OK.. 
Cons:. Only one voice (minor), volume control only available for MP3 (not for directions). 
Summary:. I was origninally going to get a TomTom based on combination of price and Consumer Reports review (Tom Tom and this model were about the same), but at last minute checked CNET review and also looked up price for this model on Amazon (selling for $353). The biggest difference was the ability of the Nuvi to announce street names (TomTom only says "Turn Left", etc). I really like the 3D mode (where the closer streets are large and the distant ones are smaller). Also, the battery life is 8 hours, only 2 on TomTom).. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use first time out of the box. Good daylight screen and volume is loud enough to hear even with the windows open.. 
Cons:. I agree it could use an external volume control. Other than that it's an excellent product for what I paid.. 
Summary:. I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy to use, full featured GPS for the road. I've only had it for a short period of time but I've had no issues to date and have easily mastered the built in features. Operating manual provided is a little skimpy but all the functions have proven to be very intuitive. On line manual is more than adequate.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very small. 
Cons:. Dashboard mount could be better. 
Summary:. If your looking for a GPS for a decent price this is the one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy, fast, speaks clearly (TTT), good routes!. 
Cons:. Occasionally slow to start up, but not a big deal.. 
Summary:. This has to be one of the easiest tech products I have ever owned, other than a TV. You open the box, turn it on, enter an address and go! It's so easy to use, my wife figured it out without much help from me! It's been pretty accurate so far, and really came in handy when they closed part of the freeway coming off the Bay Bridge as far as alternate routes were concerned. The only gripe I have, and it's minor, is when I power it up sometimes, it takes a about 2-3 minutes to find the satellite signal and I am not out in the sticks so I don't know what causes it. Eventually, it fires up and I have no problems. I love this thing!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Mapping software with easy to use features. 
Cons:. Would have preferred if the Antenna was built in. 
Summary:. Folks, I got this tiny unit from ebay (at a bargain Price) and This is the one of the best things I did to myself. I am a trucker by profession and this unit is simply great in navigating no matter where you go......US or Canada, it simply works perfect.. A Must Buy for anyone who travels more and trust me you will thank Garmin just the same way I do. Excellent product and highly recommended.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simplicity of operation. 
Cons:. Would like competition with audible.com for audio books!. 
Summary:. My wife picked it out - and as usual, she was right! No real instruction manual - but none is needed as it is intuitive! Loaded a 15 hour book and listened to the book while the Nuvi gave us expert guidance. Found a way around interstate highway delays EASILY. I found I was not taking the best routes even in areas I live in! Follow the Nuvi!. Great to know what is available for food and lodging on trips - no more being upset at stopping one exit before a favorite!. But I don't have it now - my best friend is going on a trip and HAD to borrow it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. Bought a Tom Tom 510, and was so disappointed with the interface, I exchanged it for the Nuvi 350. There is no comparison between the interfaces! The Nuvi is so much easier to use, a few touches and you are on your way. All the menus are arranged logically, and make for speedy route planning. Haven't tried the MP3 player, but I didn't buy it for that anyway. If you want a great, easy-to-use GPS, this is the one. Stay away from the Tom Tom 510!. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, light, easy to use, excellent GPS, good accssories. 
Cons:. Windshield suction device gives out sometimes. 
Summary:. I've been raving about this product to all my friends and am taking the time to rave here too. I'd be very surprised if anyone that bought this product wasn't at least satisfied with it.. I'm a long time Garmin Streetpilot III owner and, frankly, I was never more then marginally satisfied with it. But for all the good reviews online on this Garmin I would have went with a different brand. I'm so happy I gave Garmin another chance.. This device couldn't be more intuitive to use or produce more accurate results in my testing. The touch-screen is a great addition over the old button approach. I also love the onboard Audible Audiobook player. I'm a big audiobook listener and have long used an IPod for that so didn't think I'd care about that capability here. It turns out I do. The integration of the Audiobook player into the system means the system interrupts the audiobook to give direction advice by pausing it and continuing immediately after. This is far better than the Ipod method where I would sometimes miss the instructions.. I'm also amazed at how fast and how good the satellite lock is. I've even gotten lock inside my house!. As a result of this experience I can't wait for more touch-screen interfaces. I'm sold, big time!. 

$$;
Pros:. VERY GOOD FOR THE MONEY AND WORKS GREAT. 
Cons:. I DONT SEE ANY CONS YET. 
Summary:. FOR THE MONEY I WOULD RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GET THIS ONE. IT'S JUST WHAT YOU NEED TO HELP YOU IN THE ANY AREAS.. 

$$;
Pros:. I paid $369 for this unit at Walmart.com. 
Cons:. Over $300 if you want Maps of Europe. 
Summary:. I paid $369 for this unit at Walmart.com. This has to be one of the best Text to Speech units for the price. Besides it being accurate, very small and easy to use.. No one has mentioned that it comes with lots of extras. Leather case, DC adapter, AC adapter, USB cord, windshield and dash mount. My iPod that I paid $400 for only came with a USB cord and a cheap venial case.. The only thing wrong with this unit is it cost over $300 if you want Maps of Europe. $165 if you want the FM traffic receiver and a $60 yearly fee. $75 if you want the language translator.(which I bought) Oh well, someday I may buy them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, touch screen, screen is bright during day and automatically changes screen when it gets dark.. 
Cons:. Some POI's are outdated.. 
Summary:. Used this on a recent cross country trip and it worked great. Did take us to a restaurant or two that were out of business, but on the whole performed flawlessly. Allowed us to enjoy the trip and not worry about when or where to turn. I used a headset with it, and my music sounded great. Speaker was not a problem or an issue. Glare was not a problem, and screen was easily visable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright Screen, touch screen, easy to hear. 
Cons:. Battery Life. 
Summary:. Ok, so this one of the most amazing things I have ever owed!. The navigation is flawless! The screen is bright, colorful and touchscreen is perfect.. MILLIONS points of interest, if you miss a turn this little wonder recalculates automatically!. You can change directions on the fly without an issue.. Only reason not perfect 10 is battery life I found is not that good (2hrs) but of course it does come with a car adapter.. 

$$;
Pros:. Portability, size, ease of use. 
Cons:. Some destinations are not current. 
Summary:. Given a choice I would buy this product again, it's satisfied my needs completely.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, many features. 
Cons:. Screen not too bright in sunlight. 
Summary:. I am a newbie when it comes to GPS devices, so my first experience with one (in my friends car) was truly an eye opener. I said to myself that I just HAD to get one. Like most of you, I did a lot of research before purchasing my GPS device by checking reviews on sites like this one. Because my friend had a Garmin, I concentrated on this brand, and ultimately decided this was the brand for me.. Purchased the Garmin NuVi 350 a couple of weeks ago and had been using it locally (Westchester County, NY) without any issues. The real test came this past weekend when I used it to drive down to North Carolina for the weekend. It was GREAT! I came to rely on the NuVi to the point where I never took notice of my surroundings (buildings, street names, etc) because I had Jill telling me where to go. I cant say that it worked flawlessly, but it got me to every place I needed to get to. I cant begin to tell you how neat it was to find a restaurant by just punching in Where To, Restaurants, All, and VOILA, all these places to eat are displayed along with their mileage from your current position! Just pick the one you want, punch Go, and the NuVi tells you how to get there. It also gives phone numbers to all these restaurants!. Does it have its faults? Like I said before, it wasnt flawless. Here is one thing I noticed about this device, which may be an issue with all GPSs in general. When in a large parking lot and you tell the NuVi where you want to go, it gets a little confused. Even when you leave the parking lot and eventually get out on a main road, it still seems like it cant get its bearings straight. I would have to re-enter my destination; at which point it recalculates and we were on our way. This wasnt that big a deal because I had most of the places I needed to go to already programmed into the device, so it was very simple for me to re-enter my destination. I just had to go to Favorites.. I can go on and on about this device, but it would take too long to type out. If anyone is considering the NuVi and wants to chat about my experiences with it, feel free to send me an email (mjn0015@gmail.com) and we can chat.. 

$$;
Pros:. bright screen, easy directions to follow, MP3 player, really easy to use, easy to put in addresses, very accurate ETA. 
Cons:. out of date POI database, sometimes gives you slower more round-a-bout routes, traffic thing costs a lot of extra money. 
Summary:. This thing is awesome. It is incredibly easy to use and transfer from car to car. You can type in an address in only a few seconds.. I really like the size, it is big enough so the screen is easily readable but it is in now way bulky. I can easily fit it in my pocket to bring along in a friends car. The MP3 player is awesome, it can store a half gig of music on it, and you can load an SD card up with music as well.. Truly a phenomenal device.. 

$$;
Pros:. I needed it easy to operate and it is very simple.. 
Cons:. The only con I have so far is sometimes you have to listen to the voice close because of the pronunciation.. 
Summary:. I looked at several units and talked to friends that were using Navigation units. The majority liked the Garmin and especially the 350. I am a salesman and find myself in rural areas often. This unit has saved me lots of time finding job sites. Of course the wife loves it when she has to go into the Big City as she is directionally challenged. My only regret is I did not buy it sooner.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good display, easy to use, easy to hear voice instructions. 
Cons:. Some rural addresses in Illinois not in unit, CRITICAL gold registration card hard to find &#38; read. 
Summary:. The Garmin Nuvi 350 is a great unit for a great price via Amazon.com. We purchased the GPS unit for my wife's trip to Ireland where she will drive all over for 10 days. The unit is very easy to use and the box includes all the add-on's you need. We have been testing it for a few days here in Illinois and my wife loves the ease of use. We have found a few rural Illinois addresses that are not in the system.. We purchased the Nuvi 350 unit from Amazon.com (both great price &#38; shipping) and the add-on "City Navigator SD card for UK/Ireland" from IRWINCOMP.com (both great price &#38; shipping). We had the unit up and running in a few minutes. The "Quick Start Guide" (included) and the full owners manual (via garmin.com) are very well written, with lots of screen shots. The touch screen interface is easy to use and very intuitive.. The only hitch so far is that it is easy to miss the "golden ticket" in the box, the small (4x6) sheet of gold paper that has your critical product registration data. You need it to register your products with Garmin to get the updates.. We will try and update this information once my wife gets back from Ireland on how the add-on SD card worked in Dublin and the countryside.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small portable size with 6 hour battery, fast pick-up of satellites even in manhattan, easy to use interface.. 
Cons:. None that I can think of.. 
Summary:. This is an awesome GPS unit! I spent a lot of time researching my GPS unit before buying one and I could not be happier with the Garmin Nuvi 350. The satellite is super fast at determining your location when you turn the unit on, and I have never lost connection with the satellites. The user interface is ridiculously easy to use. There are more places than you could ever imagine stored in the maps (the whole US loaded on the system) including parking, ATMs, gas, stores, entertainment, etc. The device detects when the sun goes down and automatically changes the contrast on the screen. I could go on forever, this is definitely the best GPS out there for the money!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast satellite acquisition, compact size, add-ons. 
Cons:. Slow search capability, can not edit route. 
Summary:. This is my second GPS (previous purchase - Magellan 760). Advantage:. - Fast Satellite acquisition - Takes about 15 seconds to get satellite reading as compared to 30 seconds for magellan 760. With Magellan 760, it will take 5 min to get a reading.. - Compact size - It fits in your pocket and use for navigation while walking. - Maps of Canada, US and Puerto Rico are pre-loaded. - 6 millions point of interest. - Great idea of adding translation, currency, calculator which is helpful when travelling. Disadvantage. - Slow search capability-Because Nuvi 350 does not ask you to filter search by location, system is taking a long time(2 + minutes)to search.. - I got used to Magellan 760 capability of editing route. I find this very useful when wanting to avoid certain highways/streets.. - Not sure how good the suction cup is. I will have to report back after months of use.. 

$$;
Pros:. does just about everything right. 
Cons:. volume control isn't mechanical. 
Summary:. This unit is extremely versatile and does a lot more than GPS. Some people wont' care about the other functions, but you'll find yourself drawn to them eventually. It's perfect for traveling, especially to other countries because it's a jack of all trades. Love the translation function (although it's extra $). Fantastic battery life. The MP3 player is above average too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small pocket size. Many options.. 
Cons:. Large bulky mobile and home chargers.. 
Summary:. I purchased this from Sam's Club website for $387 plus shipping, insurance, etc. It takes 3 weeks however.. This is a great product. It doen't always provide the best or shortest route, but it does get you to where ever you want to go.. I've used it in Los Angeles, Ohio, ANd Pennsylvania. It's better than Mapquest and any other internet mapping service.. The Model 360 provides Bluetooth. The 350 does not, but I do not have a Bluetooth phone, so I did not need to pay the extra $100 for the 360.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, appears to be very accurate during routes, excellent features, compares very well to competition for features at price, pocket-able.. 
Cons:. Wish it had a "home" button that you could hit to immediately get to main page when you are deep into menus.. 
Summary:. So far, no real complaints other then the one noted in cons. Very easy to use right out of the box. Not much competition for the price on it's size. All others I looked at were larger and not as convenient to use. outside for hiking etc... Display can be a little hard to see in bright sunlight but, not so bad that it is not useable and, comparable to other makes.. Easy to add/remove MP3 files via USB port.. Sound is better than expected for unit of this size.. All required cables and mounts are included.. Nothing extra to but to get you up and running.. Would highly recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredibly easy to use. Just turn it on and go. It will fit in your pocket.. 
Cons:. A little pricey compared to others but you get so much with it. I wish the battery lasted longer.. 
Summary:. I drive my wife crazy with my research but nailed it with this purchase. I beat Best Buy by $200 by getting it at buydig.com on the internet. They ship quick without paying the faster shipping option. It has already come down from what I bought it at which was $421 back in March 2007. It is so easy to use and has so many features. I am amazed at the roads it sees that are sometimes nothing more than a dirt road or long drive way. Reception is exceptional. I wish the battery lasted a bit longer but you can plug it in your cigarette lighter and run with it. You can't go wrong with this unit. There are others that have many of the same features but they are bulkier and can't fit in your pocket. I am considering buying some of their other options.. 

$$;
Pros:. accurate, quick recalculation, compact. 
Cons:. No outside volume control, battery life, pricey. 
Summary:. No more need for Mapquest maps. I have used my Nuvi on many occasions and will never travel without it again. Not only is it great for traveling out of town, it found new routes to and from work that I never knew existed prior to owning it. Took it to San Fran last fall and found out just how valuable this device can be. Just put it in your rental and drive to your hotel, restaurants, anywhere. Works equally as well when walking the town on foot. My only complaint is battery life could be better. That being said, the price was well worth it. Put an outside volume control for the mp3 player and better battery performance and I'd give it a 10.. 

$$;
Pros:. small size, long battery life, text-to-speech. 
Cons:. haven't found any yet. 
Summary:. Tried a TomTom One - returned it after 2 days, purchased the Nuvi 350. NO COMPARISON. Very easy to use. Don't use a GPS without the text-to-speech. This identified every street, every highway entrance/exit ramp. I sat it on the seat and just listened to the route instructions - didn't have to watch the map. Comes with both car and home chargers and a nice case. Drove 200 miles to different locations in the same city over 10 hours - never missed a beat. Well worth the $398 from Best Buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use, quick to set up, simple, great POI database (though it was missing a grocery store which opened over a year ago near my house), quick rerouting,. 
Cons:. One stop option, no bluetooth,. 
Summary:. I'd recommend this to anyone, I really like the steet level turn by turn instructions.... 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, User Friendly and Affordable.. 
Cons:. Doesn't Do Dishes.... 
Summary:. As portable navigators are concerned, there is no comparison. I was able to start navigating directly from the box with this light weight deck of cards sized unit. The cost is somewhat prohibitive, but I got mine with a $130 discount at Costco for 349.99 plus tax. The touchpad interface is as user-friendly as they come. I previously owned the Garmin i3 which was a little too small for my aging eyes, but this Nuvi 350 is easy to read. Besides, it talks to me. All in all, I don't know how I've lived without it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Garmin name and reliability, easy to use, and "text-to-speech". 
Cons:. FM Traffic receiver is extra.. 
Summary:. With online prices coming down constantly, I finally bit the bullet (the 350 currently below $400) and bought the 350.. This is my first GPS device. I read a lot of expert and customer reviews before I plunked down the big bucks for the 350. While no electronic device in the world will have perfect customer reviews, Garmin seemed to have a lot less unhappy customers than the others.. I was looking for a GPS device, primarily because in my job I travel to quite a few homes and business addresses located in small podunk Tennessee towns. I've had it for about a month now, and I absolutely love it! It was worth more than I paid for my never having to struggle with another set of crummy Mapquest directions.. Do yourself a favor and get a GPS device (such as the 350) with "text to speech" (tells you to turn right on Maple St, rather turn right at the next street).. And regarding "text to speech," be careful that the device you buy actually has "text to speech." The market is just now being flooding with (relatively) inexpensive Korean GPS devices that appear to have "text to speech," but don't. An example is a new Uniden GPS unit that according to Amazon has "text to speech," but (according to Uniden) doesn't. Sure enough... Korea makes some great, great, great MP3 players, (and the Korean GPS devices I've seen are using the most current wiz bang technology available) but the jury is still out on whether they make great GPS devices. (When it comes to electronics... the whole is not always greater than the sum of its parts.). I haven't used the included windshield mount, because I decided to put out the extra bucks for a Portable Friction Mount that you place on the dash. It works great, too!. Since I have 53 year old eyes, another concern I had was the small screen, but with text to speech I seldom even feel the need to look at the screen. And when I do feel the need, the screen size is more than adequate.. The sound on the device is loud enough on the highway with all windows rolled up, but I have to admit that I'm now using the auxillary input on my truck stereo system.. No GPS device on the planet is going to give perfect directions, always giving the very best route, but this Garmin does a pretty darned good job. You can set it up to avoid things like tollroads, dirt roads, and making U turns.. Garmin seems to be a wee bit paranoid about saying exactly which processor it uses, but whatever processor it uses, it's fast enough to do the job, and do it well.. Other things to know: It's easy enough to upgrade the software online. Maps are fairly new and current. The full manual needs to be downloaded from the Garmin site. And you can easily make (or obtain from other Garmin fanatics) your own Points Of Interest.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has everything that I need. 
Cons:. No blue tooth but thats okay with me. 
Summary:. I just moved to california and after one week here, I knew that a GPS system was a must. I looked at all the reviews, comparisons, and prices and said that the Garmin Nuvi 350 was the one for me that was also in my price range. I bought it and I am in heaven. The only problem was that you are told that it have voice/street prompt and you do. The website does not tell you how to activate this but I searched for troubleshooting and it worked. For all, go to settings on the main menu, look for the lips and beside it you will click american. Choose the voice and the one with TTS beside it. Now you will have the streets called out to you. The other thing that I do like is the map and the names of your streets displayed at the top. I dont care about the battery life because I had it mounted on in my car at best buy. The system also has a security feature where you submit a password and no one else can use it. If you forget your password, you can go to your home location, where you designate, and can reset your password. As you can see, I love this device and would recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything.. small, packed w/ features.. 
Cons:. Battery life. 
Summary:. Now I want the nuvi 660 but i cant have both. oh well. Bought mine from www.triggerandreel.com Great price and didnt have to pay tax or shipping! Get one, u wont be disapointed. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use; Touch Screen; Accurate receiver;small. 
Cons:. 3.5inch screen may be too small for some people. 
Summary:. Purchased Nuvi 350 from buydig.com for $425.00. First time I ever used a GPS and all I can say is that this is a very user friendly interface and easy to use. Did not need any instruction manual or guidance on how to use. Graphics are colorful and clear. GPS unit came with all the latest software version and maps (checked with Garmin). Receiver seems to be pretty accurate and quick to realize that you are off course, and notifies you that it is "recalculating". One thing that I like about it is that is lets you know of an upcoming turn that you need to make, than warns you again at the spot where you would make that turn. Maps include US, Canada, BC and PR. What I really like about the unit is that whereever you are, you can go to the menu items and it will tell you the location of places (hospitals, food locations, car repair, hotels, gas station..etc) and will guide you to these places. Real handy when you travel.. One minor complaint is that in bright sunlight, the screen is difficult to see. Volume control is software based, so you have to jump to a menu item to adjust. volume, but not a big deal. Another tiny issue that I see happen is that a road can have a street name as well as a road number (i.e. County Road 111 = Johnson Blvd). The Nuvi 350 will say "turn left at County Road 111", but the only road sign in front of you is "Johnson Blvd". I don't think you can blame the GPS unit on this, but just don't always rely 100% on what you hear. Just realize that it can only mention one road name, not both.. Overall, I am very happy with the Nuvi 350. It has exceeded my expectations. It is very compact in size and easy to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Perfect size - Voice activated directions. 
Cons:. No external volume control. 
Summary:. Being from Iowa and reading reviews of another GPS device that was rated very good, except it didn't work in Iowa - I kept looking at others and finally made the decision to buy this one. I made sure it had version 8 maps on it. I'm very happy I did. We don't travel to major cities alot, but when we do, I absolutely hate to try and navigate the streets trying to look at a map. My wife will admit, she doesn't read maps very good, so I usually have her drive while I read the map and look for the streets coming up where we have to exit or turn onto. She also gets nervous driving in these big cities - so as you can tell I needed one of these GPS devices so that I can drive and have someone give me the directions. I have played with this one for about two weeks around here and it has worked perfectly. My daughter had a basketball tourney in another town - I plugged in the address and it took us directly to the gym. We live in a town of about 2,000 people and it has the local cafe, local gas stations and even the two local bars listed. We are taking a trip to the auto show in Chicago in February, so it will get the ultimate test then. If I have any problems then, I will write another review. Right now, I highly recommend this model.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is compact in size so it does not block your vision while driving. It will caculate routes in under 20 secondsThe antenna is very sensitive and will even pickup while I am inside of my house... 
Cons:. Accessories are expensive.. 
Summary:. Got this gadget for Christmas and the best way I can discibe it is WOW!I have been testing it by deliberately driving off the prescribed route and Nuvi immediately makes corrections. Extremely accurate. I have been very impressed with the Nuvi... it has kept me on the "best" (in my opinion) route 95% of the time, and if I ever felt I wanted to find another way to get someplace, it quickly recalculated after I made a turn. I really like the "avoid" feature which allows me to avoid highways and toll lanes. In addition, the Nuvi is so small I can easily take it with me when I leave the car. I would gladly recommend the Nuvi to friends and family.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, small portable, very intuitive. 
Cons:. Not fully Mac compatible. 
Summary:. Wasn't looking to buy a gps. Wife saw a Cobra device on QVC. Thought we'd try it out. Then, after researching further, found the Nuvi 350. Cobra should stick to radar devices. This is a great deal. Very accurate, easy to setup and remove from the car, and the text-to-speech is a must.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate, crisp, bright screen, easy-to-use interface. 
Cons:. Cost, no external volume control. 
Summary:. Do yourself a favor and buy the Garmin Nuvi 350 right now. This is by far the easiest to use, most accurate portable GPS unit I've ever had. I was thinking about purchasing the Nuvi 660 because I thought the Nuvi 350 screen would be too small. I was wrong. The Nuvi 350 screen is bright and legible with crisp text and sharp colors. I absolutely love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, easy to use, screen size, touch screen. 
Cons:. Could not find a local store in the data base, route back to the house was a bit off.. 
Summary:. The wife bought me a Magellen 6000t for Christmas. Which is a nice unit but it was too BIG. So i exchanged the unit for the Nuvi 350. I have been using GPS units for 10 years now and i can tell you that Garmin is the BEST GPS you can buy, the 2nd best would have to be Magellen. I own a Magellen and they are great units but Garmin is a better GPS. What about TOM TOM, i am sure they are a great company but Garmin has been around longer and has more expereance then TOM TOM when it comes to GPS's.. Now about the Nuvi 350. I have had it for 4 days now and i have been using it around town. Sure it has taken me a differnt way then i normaly take (one time only) but i didnt buy it for my area. I bought the unit for when i travel. All other times i used the GPS, it has taken me on my normal routes. The 350 does offer two routes, the shorter distance and quickest route. Using one or the other will give you different routes to take so i will have to try them both to see the best option.. One problem i did have is that the 350 did not find an electronic store near my house. It did show the other stores in my area. Since i knew where the store was, it didnt make a difference.. Bottom Line:. If you want a great GPS made by a Company that has been around for years. You should go with the Nuvi 350, 360 or 660. All the bad reviews you read might be true. Those units can be bad or the user doesnt know how to use the GPS. My unit was $499.00 on sale at Target you can buy them cheaper on the Web. For the price i paid, this unit is well worth it. Just remeber, nothing is perfect and every thing has flaws. Try out the unit youself and if you dont like it then send it back and get another brand/unit. Try it your self and you will see.. I will wright an update in 6 months. I am pretty sure i will not have any problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. Display (even in sunlight), Text-to-speech directions, East of Use. 
Cons:. No SD card included. 
Summary:. Easy to use right from the box...I had mine unpacked and operating in under three minutes and have yet to read any instructions. The UI is VERY intuitive. It seems to read your mind at times! I took it on a trip from St. Louis to and around Branson, MO and to and around Indianapolis, IN. The GPS locator and maps seem very accurate so far...no errors yet. The POI's seem very up to date as well...found everything I needed so far and every address entered. Bright display in direct sunlight and at night. A solid GPS compared to my older TomTom unit. Garmin has a hit with the Nuvi series in my opinion.. 

$$;
Pros:. small, easy to use,and very accurate. 
Cons:. speaker sound (not loud enough and distorts on maximum setting), and the power cord seems to be proprietary (trid to use my phone cord and it roze the device). 
Summary:. This is a great product. It works within the first minute of opening the box and no reading is required!.. This is truly an excellent GPS, including the screen display, accuracy and ease of use. The battery life is also very impressive.. 

$$;
Pros:. n you expect and as good as any navigator reading from a map.. 
Cons:. The clip on for the window is a joke, but I overlook it, since it is used mostly in rental cars and occassionaly in my wifes auto, and I can live with it.. 
Summary:. I paid more money than I would have liked, and now I invested even more to buy the extra travel guides for an upcoming trip to Europe. I even downloaded MP3 music from my CD's for the flight over, so I do think it was worth the investment on a per use basis perhaps not, but it gets me there and I don't have to rely on Mapquest in a strange city driving at night by myself.. 

$$;
Pros:. Interface, Battery-life, Accuracy, Nice Extras. 
Cons:. Haven't encountered any so far. 
Summary:. For starters, this unit is very easy to use. The menus were well thought out, easy to read, and easy to adjust.. Text-to-speech. WOW!! While it wasn't my main reason of purchase, it has become the feature I am most thankful for in this unit. I live near a city where there are many five-point roads, piggy-back roads, and changes to a road's name across intersections. Without text-to-speech, my drives would be confusing. In busy traffic I want to keep my eyes on the road and not on the nav unit. Text-to-speech makes driving easier and safer.. All the extras are nice. While I'll likely only use a few of them, like the menus, they are well built and easy to traverse.. The thoughtfulness of the MP3 menu is easy to see. While it in no way competes with an IPOD, with one tap on the screen you can go from map to mp3 player and back again. With a 2GB SD card and about 1/2 gig on the unit, you can store plenty of music.. Battery life is great. It pushes 6-7 hours and charges quickly.. BTW. Creating custom POIs is fun. There were some restaurants that I couldn't find in the original POI list, so I added my own. No need to pay for a custom POI list. The POI loader program that you can download from Garmin has a great helpmenu with instructions on creating your own POI.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely easy to use. 
Cons:. Shortest distance setting feature is worthless. 
Summary:. It makes city or country driving a breeze. Saves enough time to pay for itself in short order. I paid $579 from Amazon (after discount) 2 months ago and saw it advertised at Best Buy a week ago for $489. Oh well.. Always use the fastest route when setting personal preferences.. It has many bonus features that I will never find myself using.. It has never steered me wrong. I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great size, great features. 
Cons:. No cons from this reviewer. 
Summary:. This is a great GPS unit, fast bootup, fast satellite lock, intuitive user interface. Really easy to use right out of the box and the price is getting better each day.. 

$$;
Pros:. Recalculates quickly if you miss your turn, User Friendly, Reliable, Speaks, Excellent Features. 
Cons:. None come to mind. 
Summary:. I love this GPS Navigation system!! Best investment I ever made, however I do not recommend any GPS Navigation system to any new driver. A new driver may focus too much on the screen and not enough on the road.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything about this GPS is great. 
Cons:. Sound Sound Sound. 
Summary:. I can compare this GPS to the magellan 300 roadmate (which the Garmin 350 blows the roadmate 300 away)Two of the biggest reason i changed from magellan to garmin was the 1 magellan hasn`t updated there mapping since 2001 and there not going to update in the near future.. and 2 magellans customer service SUCKS bad .. the only thing i can say garmin could of done better on the nuvi 350 was the speakers are either to small or thay dont put out enough sound if i turned up the volume all the way it got really distorted if you turn it down 1-2 clicks down you cant really hear the directions with road noises thay could do far better there with this unit but all and all this is a far better GPS thanks Garmin... just fix the speakers where you can hear it...if anyone out there who can help with this problem please do thanks Mr Ual. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate. great screen. compact.. 
Cons:. Fragile screen, sometimes sent down 1-way streets wrong way. 
Summary:. Had mine for a year now. Saves me tons of aggrivation since moving to another state and I travel to customers.. Fragile screen: don't press too hard! I cracked the glass behind the touch screen while wearing motorcycle gloves and I guess I pressed a bit too hard.. A few times I was guided down one-way streets the wrong way though I had the sense not to do it.. Some (if not most) extra features are useless to me.. Windsheild mount can be fragile. Broke at a pivot point.. Case it comes with isn't great. Picked up a Lowepro Z5 camera case, fits it perfectly. Provides good protection.. Overall, A good product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast satellite acquisition.. 
Cons:. No external volume control.. 
Summary:. This is my third GPS for auto navigating and hands down it is the best! I just completed a 1,000 mile trip with it and 99.9% of the time it was accurate. (One restaurant wasn't where indicated, and one Interstate entrance was the wrong direction.) Satellite access times were exceptional. After exiting tunnels the GPS was indicating immediately - a serious flaw in my previous systems. The display is flawless and it automatically (through some kind of magic) adjusts the scale to just what is needed at the time. The lack of an external volume control is a minor inconvenience - it just means that you have to push a couple of extra buttons. It's compact size makes it easy to handle for remote programming. I don't think you can go wrong with this unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Allows for geocaching. 
Cons:. none to speak of for me. 
Summary:. The best thing (as a standard GPS it works great), IMHO, is that the truly portable, battery operated 350 provides the actual long and lat. coordinates so it is perfect for geocaching - if you don't know what that is, checkout www.geocaching.com. Most, if not all of the other car units do not include this readout, plus most don't run on indpendent battery power.. Of course you can but a cheaper unit that provides primarily coords and nothing else, but it is really nice to have great mapping and speach and the coords.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is very easy to use, internal battery. 
Cons:. no manual included. 
Summary:. I have the magellen 760 and I just purchased this. I am very impressed with the Garmin 350. It is very easy to use. My wife could figure it out. I tried the Lowarance 500c as well and that, while the screen is big, is very difficult to figure out. I had to carry the manual with me all the time. You just turn on the Garmin and go, that's it. For anyone wanting a user-friendly gps, this is the one to get. You might think that the screen is too small, but try it out and you will find that it can be seen very easy. My magellen keeps on breaking because of the cradle, but the Garmin, you just turn on. For someone who uses a gps everyday for work, this is an excellent product. I am very impressed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Intuitive, Nice Touchscreen. 
Cons:. Battery Life. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS which I purchased for every day use and travelling. I've been using this GPS for 3 months in Canada,US,France,Germany,Italy and Austria. There are many areas like a lot of the reviews have covered however I like short and sweet.. I purchased this unit because it was small and I love touch screen. The ability to easily take it off your dash and throw it in your pocket is what a GPS should be in my opinion, flexible.. I've used the unit in numerous countries and it's been accurate from Seattle to Paris to Bavaria. Now it's not 100% perfect however it's about 99%. Meaning that there may be a delay in updating postioning when you're in the shadow of a couple tall buildings limiting sky view. Otherwise the only complaint is battery life which is rated at 4 hours and I would say that's a max rating.. I was very happy to see that even when I was in Venice walking in very tight streets with limited sky view that the unit performed very well.. In summary I would highly recommend the unit for ease of use and for portability and of accuracy. It's too bad the unit can't play video. I've tried numerous things however video doesn't seem to ba a possibility.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nearly perfect route selection. 
Cons:. Battery is not user replaceable. Expensive.. 
Summary:. This unit is small in stature, but a giant on performance. The unit really finds satellites and selects the best route most of the time. Once or twice the unit needed to be restarted, because it would not find any satellites. However, I suspect that newer firmware will sort the few bugs that do exist.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, great display with key info in larger font, small and light.. 
Cons:. High Price &#38; Way too expensive for updates &#38; Travel Guide addins. Sound is so-so.. 
Summary:. This unit helped a great deal with my recovery from Magellan Rm 300 and Rm 700. After dealing with problems in FIRST YEAR of magellan owneership with each unit and SURLY "customer service" from Thales Magellan - I got a full refund from Circuit City (had extended service plan) and bought the GAMRIN NUVI.. Now, i turned it on in the parking lot thinking sometime durning my drive home it would pick up satellites- ** IT WAS READY TO NAVIGATE BEFORE I GOT OUT OF THE STORE PRKING LOT! This was right out of the box after leaving the store! **. I was able to set my home addess in favorites, then press "go home" and begin using gps navigation to my home in about 1 minute. INCREDIBLY EASY TO USE.. Go to a store and compare the touch screens and displays on this and similar units - you will understand the excellence of this unit while trying it in the store on the display model.. The downside is the price of updates and sound quality. Sound is only an issue here because it plays mp3 &#38; audio books.. I can run this through my Monster FM transmitter used for playing ipod over the radio and it works better - but for price of this unit, it should have exceptional sound from built in speaker.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great gadget. Its compact, easy to use, gives correct directions most of the time.. 
Cons:. Intermittent annoying problem acquiring satelites/GPS software would not load.. 
Summary:. Excellent unit as above. My unit intermittently would be unable to load GPS software and thus be unable to locate satellites. This issue has plagued some NUVI 350 models. I have sent mine back for a replacement.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick, easy to use, Clear. 
Cons:. Expensive!. 
Summary:. Even the price is over $600 I really think it is worth it. Very easy to use, compact, and quick start up for satellite lockup. This thing is better than my $2K option for my 2005 Acura TL built in Navigation. So for you guys want to get a car with navi. Just save your money and buy you a Garmin 350. You wont be disappointed!. 

$$;
Pros:. great screen size, reliable gps, mp3, audiobook, etc. 
Cons:. no external volume control, no bluetooth. 
Summary:. this is a great unit. its well designed and has a lot of additional features, like an mp3 player and audiobook. i do need to update my maps for recent constructions though, but overall a great unit, and i highly recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast acquisition, very fast recalc, well-designed UI, small and light. 
Cons:. screen could be brighter, audio gets distorted at high volume, somewhat expensive. 
Summary:. Bought this before going on a vacation in Portugal for 10 days. We put it though its paces with our rental car - urban centers, small towns, open freeways. We used it to drive around pretty much the entire country.. The Nuvi really made the driving (and, in turn, our vacation) stress-free and fun. No fumbling with maps, arguing about directions, or getting lost. Sat. acquisition was usually very fast (at most a couple of minutes). Also was able to maintain sat lock in urban areas - we only lost the lock once during 10 days of driving (with the exception of long tunnels). Recalc route was extremely fast (a few seconds) whenever we missed a turn or decided to ignore the chosen route.. The directions the Nuvi gave were surprisingly accurate. Helped us navigate the labyrinth of twisty little one-way roads in Lisbon, Porto, Evora, etc. - can't imagine how we would have gotten to our hotels without it!. Screen can be difficult to see in direct sunlight, even at highest brightness setting -- would be nice if it were a bit brighter, but this wasn't such a big deal in practice.. Our tiny Citroen rental car was noisy at highway speeds, requiring us to boost the Nuvi volume -- however this would cause voice prompt audio to be somewhat distorted due to its tiny speaker. We found the best trade-off to be one notch below the highest volume level.. Map rendering quality is excellent in both 2D and 3D modes. Zooming in and out is fast. We also love the ability to "touch and drag" on the screen to scroll around the map like with Google Maps.. One reason I opted for the Nuvi was its size - we needed something we could easily pop out of the rental car and take with us (not wanting to leave anything of value in the car).. We used the Nuvi in pedestrian mode a couple of times in Lisbon - useful to keep track of where you are. However, for GPS to stay on, the antenna must be flipped out - so the device will not fit in its case, or your pocket, in this configuration. This means you need to keep flipping it open and re-acquiring the sats every time you want to check your position -- a real pain. If they just let the GPS remain on with the antenna closed, it would have been much more useful when walking around - it probably could have even maintained signal lock in many cases.. Language guide is fun option, but wasn't incredibly useful. The text-to-speech is cool but its pronunciation of Portuguese was a bit funky, from what we could tell! Travel Guide was occasionally handy - we actually did check some of the hotel and restaurant reviews - however the reviews are extremely short blurbs (couple of sentences usually). We didn't use the MP3 player or Photo Viewer.. All and all - an excellent product. I help engineer mobile consumer electronics devices for a living - and I can say these folks did an excellent job. The industrial design, UI design, and functionality are very well thought-out and put together. Performance is also excellent. Not perfect, but the best all-around package I've seen for a GPS of this type -- you will not be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast Calculations Great Touch Screen Ease of Use. 
Cons:. No Owner's Manual Extra Map Costs. 
Summary:. After all the research and reviews I've read. I decided to bite the bullet and shell out $800 CDN + taxes = $932. Consumer Reports rates this one as the best.. Whether in the big city of Toronto or the country it performed great. Speed, ease of use, multiple language choices, accurate mapping and intuitive programing makes the bitterness of cost disappear fast. They say you get what you pay for, and I am certainly happy that I put out the extra $$$ for a great peice of technology that you can take anywhere.. This is the smallest GPS on the market (to my knowledge) and it fits into your shirt pocket easily, or mounts on the windshield.. It doesn't block the driver's view like some others on the market.. I bought it primarily for travel in Europe, but it will no doubt be an asset as I'm on the road for a living.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, functionality. 
Cons:. Battery Life. 
Summary:. I took a trip to Southern California, LOTS of freeways great place to get lost but with this unit NO problems except when I tried to second guess it but even then it told me what I need to do to get back on track.. Battery only lasts about 2 hrs.. If POI's are important the basic unit misses a lot.. 

$$;
Pros:. User friendly...you don't need to read an instruction manual. 
Cons:. When you stop for gas or food- it recalculates and trys to get you back on your route immediately. 
Summary:. This is an incredible little GPS. Just returned from a 10 day car trip and used it constantly. It is super easy to run. You can use it in the car or anywhere. The battery charge doesn't last the 4-8 hrs that is described in the brochure, we found that it needed to be plugged in the car, after 3 hrs- but that wasn't a problem. I bought this product over others out there due to the great reviews by owners. They scored it even higher than the computer "geeks". I have to agree with the owners. Buy this one over the others out there. Got a great price at Costco.com.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything on it works perfectly. The best feature is the fact that it fits in your pocket, so you can take it wherever you go, and it wont get stolen from your car. Also, full Mp3 player. 
Cons:. no bluetooth to connect cell phone. 
Summary:. My wife and I are sooo happy with this. She can finally drive around and not get lost. The maps work, but sometimes you have to edit the avoidances to get the route you prefer. This is really easy through the interface. You can have music playing and it will pause it to give you the next directions. This leads to THE BEST FEATURE: HEADPHONE JACK. I can't describe how incredibly better the direction are to hear and understand when the come at you in stereo through the cars speakers.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, accurate (with up-dates installed). 
Cons:. For the price it should include wx &#38; traffic. 
Summary:. Very reliable unit. I have used various GPS devices ( commercial airplanes, etc) &#38; the NUVI 350 is as good as any of them &#38; better than most. Easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone. I did not rank it a ten because it is not perfect, but very close.. 

$$;
Pros:. Recalculating is fast. Compact size. Light weight.. 
Cons:. Mediore speaker. No female voice choices. For new addresses not on map, unit should allow input by zip code.. 
Summary:. Bought the unit from Fry's Electronics in San Diego for $599. Worked right off the box taking me from the store to the hotel without a glitch. Very please with this purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate, Small, Easy to Use, Neat Features. 
Cons:. Voice navigation and MP3 volume use same control. 
Summary:. I'm a traveling consultant and this GPS is a must. Since I'm in a new city every week I was very dependant on gps systems in rental cars (Hertz Neverlost). Sometimes Hertz dosent have a Neverlost available (or it dosent come in certain vehicles) and it always costs extra. With this nifty gadget I never have to worry about getting lost. You can preload address and save them for future use. I've also used the Points of Interest to find places to eat, shop or just hang out. The MP3 player is a nice touch. It mutes the music when it prompts you to navigate. One minor complaint is that the MP3 player and navigation volume uses the same control. It would be nice to be able to listen to the music at say volume 5 or 6 but have the voice prompts at 8 or 9. Again, very minor complaint.. System is extreamly accurate, cold boot can take up to 2-3 min, but warm boot is extreamly quick sometimes less than 1 min if you're still in the same area where you shut the unit down.. I will never travel without this GPS. So small you can walk with it and it's even useful around my home town as well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small but very readable in bright sun &#38; at night, super fast recalculation , reliable. 
Cons:. Speech gets jarring and a little difficult to understand at high volume. 
Summary:. We just came back from a vaction to Long Island, NY to Florida, and this GPS was a life saver. I did have all the tourbooks and Maps etc from AAA but I used them rarely. When we were ready to stop driving and rest for the night, the lodging option was excellent, since it gives phone numbers,distance etc, we called compared prices etc and then chose the best option .. When I missed a street or exit. it is super fast in recalculating . about 3-5 secs on average.Then only problem I had is that with 2kids portable DVD players in the back, at full volume the speech gets jarring and difficult to understand sometimes. Overall I would place this at the same level as my Ipod Nano!!.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, Touch screen, Size, Continues to work through long tunnels, Does not have to be mounted on window/dash, Language dictionary. No Downloading of maps. 
Cons:. Does not give street names with European Map Card. 
Summary:. I mail ordered the Nuvi 350 with a "plug and play" European Map Card and received it 2 days before our trip on June 10th. It came with no directions. So off we went, landed in Germany, picked up our new car in Munich, and turned the unit on for the 1st time, plugged into the cigarette lighter. I was hoping for the best. An earlier review in cnet mentioned that the unit would work while sitting on the console, in your hand, etc.-- that is it did not need to be in the window. That was a selling feature to me as we are not legally allowed to have the units mounted to the windshield (California) and I was not going to put a mount on the dash of my new car.. The unit worked near perfect. My front passenger navigator (13 year old daughter played around with the functions and had the unit working perfect--zooming in &#38; out, adding a touch of Europe with Km, and an English accent (the Aussie was a little over the top). She could touch screen slide across the map, and so on). This was all figured out with no enclosed intructions and we never had a navigator before.. So, we used the unit for 30 days on Western European Roads with only one minor problem. The new car had one lighter output and at times we would use and ipod holder so the Nuvi went w/o aux. electricity for a few hours on a long drive. It went dead and when we plugged it back into the lighter and it stayed dead. We left it plugged in for 20 minutes and still no life. Then, my daughter looked under the rotating antennae and found a reset buttion, pushed it once, and it sprang back to life.. Great stuff about this unit while in Europe: 1. Plug and play card for all of western Europe. We used it in Germany, Austria, Italy, France, and in the Swiss Alps. From small towns to remote mountain roads, it worked great. 2. It worked through a 7 km tunnel, somehow knowing our speed and direction going in, and giving us correct intructions for a turn right out of the tunnel. 3. We could go for the "scenic route" or go on the Autostrada or click on the no toll-roads and skip the expensive French/Italian freeways (they were about the same price as the fuel!). 4. We could put in the Pont du Gard in Provence as a "site" and it would come up in the menu and we could navigate right to it. Hotels, museums, etc. were easy to find on the menu. 5. We could sit outside the hotel on the balcony, punch in our next location, and it would accurately give us our destiination time--say from Cinque Terre in Italy over to Arles in France and the time estimation was near perfect. 6. This unit saved us late in the evening when a wreck closed down a road and we had to make a 15 km detour through the back roads in Tuscany. 7. The warnings or prompts were speed related--at 30 km (about 20 mph) they were closer to the intersection. At 210 km on the Autobahn ( it would give you an 8 km notice, then a 3 km notice about a turn. Even then, anytime you wanted a prompt, touch the lower right corner and you received a verbal update.. I bought this mainly for the European trip and so I have written a lot about the European use of this unit. I bought the unit and plug and play on "faith" because there was simply no reviews on the Garmin plug and play maps. It worked awsome. Most of the rental cars seemed have a Tom Tom units in the window--a big obstruction including all the mounting hardware. In fact our friends had rental cars that came with Tom Tom units and they worked fine. As a test, at times we received quite different directions and split-up to test the units. In the end, though, we always seemed to end up pulling up to the driveway at the same time.. So, ours worked great. The unit had only the one issue when we let it run of charge. It worked well in the passenges (front or rear) hands, &#38; worked when placed in the center console. So, it was an awsome purchase and my wife and I never had an argument on directions or finding a place on the map -- nice when driving 100 mph. And finally, we did not need to buy the maligned "i-drive" to get navigation on our new car.. Just back in the states, I have not used this in California yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Turned on and was able to start using without even looking at the directions. The interface is self explanatory.. 
Cons:. No external volume control. But the main menu page which is very easy to click to from any screen, has a volume control right on it.. 
Summary:. I did lots of research on GPS units and decided to purchase this one a few days ago for $699 at Circuit City. It is amazing, super easy to use, and so helpful when driving. I love that you can just snap it out of its holder and throw it in your pocket; it is much thinner than most of the other models, but yet has just as big of a screen. I highly recommend this model. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Good work Garmin!. 

$$;
Pros:. compact, excellent routing. 
Cons:. weak succion cup, long time to acquire satellites. 
Summary:. I have had this GPS for one month now, and I am very pleased with it. I have used it extensively on two long trips to the West Coast, as well as home on the East Coast, and it has performed flawlessly. I have been especially impressed by its database of businesses (I was able to navigate from hotel to hotel in the Pacific Northwest by simply entering the name of the hotel I was going to, without its street address), and its routing capabilities; in particular, I was quite impressed when I traveled to Vancouver Island and back: on both trips, the unit correctly directed me to the dock of the ferry I needed to take, and included the ferry trip in its route. I have also had great success in rural Vermont, getting directions to places other GPS just treat as "off the map". Finally, I have found the user interface on the unit to be quite well done, and reasonably intuitive to use without referring to the manual (though it took me a while to "discover" that you could get all the steps of a trip by clicking on the current "step" in the main map screen -- my own fault for not reading the manual).. I have two small gripes with the unit: first, the succion cup keeps on falling from my windshield, and I worry that I will damage the unit over time. Second, the unit is very slow acquiring satellites when you turn it on after traveling with the unit off. This is especially annoying when getting off a plane, as it takes 10 minutes for the unit to find its location once you leave the parking garage with your rental car. If you don't know where you are going, these are 10 really long minutes. I have now gotten into the habit of letting the unit "find itself" before I get into the car, but it's annoying if you are in a hurry.. Overall, I am very pleased with this GPS, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a powerful, yet portable unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. GPS capabilities, features, recalculation speed. 
Cons:. Audio quality, cost. 
Summary:. A much better GPS than was built into my Volvo. Just finished a vacation trip through New England and the GPS accuracy was great. You can now find it around $600 at places like buy.com.. I was originally concerned about the small screen size, but it was fine.. PS - Don't leave it out when you park - it's a big car theft item now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very accurate GPS with streets specifically noted in instructions, rather than typical, "Turn left in 100 yards.". Much more accurate than Navamn unit (crap!), TomTom (Gets lost!). 
Cons:. Expensive. Needs voice recognition to get a 10 from me.. 
Summary:. I've tried 3 other GPS devices. This is the best hand-held unit on the market today. Not worth the extra money for the Nuvi 360 upgrade.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, bright display. 
Cons:. Screen too reflective. 
Summary:. I bought the Nuvi after previewing/using a similar Garmin model when renting a car during a 5 day trip to CA. I needed everything from highway detail to street detail for several cities. The Nuvi is much lighter and very easy to use. Only drawback is the screen is too reflective. I've solved that by buying the HP IPaq screen overlays (for their 1910 model) which fit EXACTLY, no trimming required. Sometimes it takes awhile to get signal, but so far, I love the unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything... great directions, intuitive..... 
Cons:. Misses a couple of features the 2610 has.. 
Summary:. I have had the Garmin 2610 for 3 years and loved it... I gave it to my son and bought the smaller Nuvi 350. If I didn't have the 2610 I would have given this unit a 10. I miss the speed and upcoming exit displays that the 2610 has. One loses the speed when you are ona route and I miss it telling me that I am 3... 2... 1 miles away from exit 23.. Other than that... BUY THIS UNIT.. it is small, compact, easy to read and a breeze to use. The setup was so easy you only have to read the supplied sheet... not an entire book (as with the 2610.. Mounting and taking it off the mount is simple, it has great maps, and actually has given me better directions than the 2610! As I am writing this I almost want to change my rating to a 10... enjoy!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good features &#38; very easy to use. 
Cons:. Battery life could be longer. 
Summary:. Switched to a new car that didn't have a navigation system like my Murano had. After checking the features and reviews I picked this one and have been very happy with it. It sometimes takes a long time (like 3 minutes) to get sat. signal - but other times it's less than a minute and I'm not sure why.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use right out of the box!. 
Cons:. The female British voice stinks!. 
Summary:. This is the third time that I have purchased a Garmin product and I have to say each time Garmin has left me extremely impressed with the very high quality of the products that they sell. Previously purchased a Rhino 130 for my wife. She loves it. Previously purchased a Forerunner 201 for me still love it. This GPS is very user friendly. Tons of features. Extremely accurate! Easy to mount and set up. If it wasn't so darn portable I would have bought 2! Found it at AbesofMaine.com. Best price and great service! Placed order online on Sunday afternoon. I was called and e-mailed to confirm the order first thing Monday morning! Even given the name for a personal sales tech! Shipped out that Monday evening and I had it on my doorstep by 11 am Wednesday with the 2 day UPS shipping.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, size, clarity, safety, update software, windshield mount. 
Cons:. Rerouting quick but a bit stubborn, too many unnecessary extras, would love ability to use disposable batteries in a pinch.. 
Summary:. A fantastic device! Garmin has the right form-factor and ease of use to allow the general public to immediately enjoy this GPS right out of the box. Two minutes to setup and we were off. Easy to see screen with the volume being plenty loud enough. Street names being spoken is a great advantage. POI database fairly accurate as well as maps... about two to three years behind present. Rerouting on missed turns quick and fairly accurate but there was a tendency to insist that i retrace steps when not necessary... as if it liked to take certain roads, even if not necessary anymore. Easy to input destination, great information at many levels but the main display has just the right amount of info without being overloaded.. Why does this device have to come with an mp3 player, picture slideshow, audio book player etc.? Isn't it a GPS? Can we cut price/costs and just deliver a great GPS?. Highly recommended!. 

$$;
Pros:. Thin and Light, Very Fast Satellite Lock, Excellent Touch Screen, Excellent viewability despite 3" screen and 320x240 resolution. 
Cons:. For what it is-none. Would like to see 4" screen model and improvement to MP3 Capability in the future (Playlists and WMA Subscripition Music Support). 
Summary:. Purchased at Best Buy for $599 on 6/18/06 (Bellevue, WA).. Totally awesome. Much better than the built in nav in my old 2004 Jaguar (which was good and also a touch screen). Text to speech is a great feature. Very simple to use (perfect for technology neophites). Despite small screen, very easy to see and type on.. Once you hold this thing, you'll fall in love.. Would recommend over the TomTom for sure (although Tom Tom's 4" screen is nice, it's bulk is a big turn off for me). 

$$;
Pros:. ,accurate navigation, voice directions, easy to read screen in sunlight, lightweight, ,. 
Cons:. none at this time. 
Summary:. This is an awesome device. Accurate navigation, lightweight, multi function unit. I love how the unit recalculates accurately if you go a different way than it offers. We took it on several test drives to see its operation we detoured to see if the unit would get us back on track. We were plesantly surprised at how quickly it recalculates your position and provided a new route. I walked with the unit and found it gave the same accurate performance. I am Extremely happy with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. announces street names before turns, portable, fast. 
Cons:. no cons so far. 
Summary:. First, do your homework on price before buying the Nuvi 350. The stores are selling them at $799 (Best Buy, etc). If you buy it at a store that's $840 with tax. I ordered mine at Pcnation.com at $639 with delivery included and no tax. Other online sites also price this item in the mid $600s.. I have never owned a GPS but have used the Onstar in auto rentals. The Nuvi 350 compares favorably. At this price and quality, that this model gives you names of streets that you'll be turning onto is a big plus. It also locates satellites pretty quickly and retrieves routes very quickly. If you know a shortcut to the general place you're heading, it will recalibrate the route very quickly too.. The Nuvi 350 is very small and fits in your pocket. This portability is a huge plus. The face is not too small that it loses its effectiveness in the map area. As a beginner to the GPS world, I am happy with this very easy to use device and highly recommend it..

Summary:. After getting my second job that requires me to drive around from appointment to appointment, I decided to get a gps unit. My choice was between the Magellan RoadMate 800 and the nuvi 350. I have 2 friends and my dad that have the roadmate, and they all like it alot. I personally didn't care for the size of it and I wanted something I could take with me when I travel out of the country or from car to car very easily. After a few days of research I ended up picking up my nuvi from the local bestbuy with a 10% off coupon. This gadget is awesome, within 5 minutes of getting the box open, I was plotting a course to my home from where I bought the nuvi.. The nuvi navigated flawlessly to my first destination. The next day I decided to take it with me to the beach and a friend of mine got her hands on it. Keep in mind my friend is a girl with very little technical skill, and she commented how easy the nuvi was to use. Also a nice feature is the mp3 player, its no ipod but it is great when there is no radio around and you want to hear some tunes.. Only drawbacks I have experienced is the short battery life when using the mp3 player(which is fine because thats not the nuvi's primary function) and the glare from the sun could make the screen hard to see at times. Otherwise the nuvi is near perfect so far..
