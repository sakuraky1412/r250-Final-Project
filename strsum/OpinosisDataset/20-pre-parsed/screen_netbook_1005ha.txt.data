glossy screens are the stupidest invention of this millenium .

4 do not get wax on your screen .

0 out of 5 stars bad lcd screen, october 7, 2009

screen brightness is very satisfactory .

hard to see full web pages on small screen, resolution inadequate .

only 10, inch screen, small keyboard and no cd, rom .

1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several toolbars have been turned on .

long battery life, sharp looking machine, fingerprint magnet,glossy screen=glare,ease of use and portability .

pretty decent screen quality .

blue screen crashed several times .

very nice, in fact, though i strongly dislike glossy screens ,  no matter, i knew it would have one when i ordered it .

9  screens, but felt that was too much of a sacrifice .

screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .

1 inch screens, windows xp operating systems, a plethora of usb ports, a card reader, wifi and most have a few color choices .

i began by considering netbooks with screens smaller than the now, standard 10 .

just a big dark, screen paperweight .

also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the dvd .

5 pass ,  screen is bright and large enough .

the screen size works just fine for me .

it's small with a very clear screen .
