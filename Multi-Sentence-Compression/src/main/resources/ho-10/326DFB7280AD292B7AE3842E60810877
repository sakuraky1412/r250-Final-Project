i am a good sleeper but that was beyond me , there were above my room , under my room , around my room and in the street .
it was a mistake ( for 9 euros i would have gotten a nice expresso , a bottle of water and some food in the station ) .
that night all the teenagers came back to the hotel about 2:30 am ( or they woke me up only then ) and initiated a festival of running , shouting , banging the doors , laughing , kicking things and similar .
i stayed at le grillon 3 nights due to a conference i had in strasbourg , i wanted something not very expensive ( which is the case ) , close to the train station ( also right ) .
i feared that they will be problematic and i discussed them with the guy at the desk , he shrugged and said that there was nothing they could do , that the teenagers had teachers with them .
upon arrival i already noticed the amount of teenagers running up and down the stairs shouting , it was a wednesday afternoon .
the final day i decided to splurge 9 euros ( it is not expensive to be honest ) and have breakfast .
i got a room in the second floor , ok size , spartan but ok , just a bottle of liquid soap for everything in the wall , ok clean , good amount of towels .
this room was similar to the previous but half the size , super small and very very crammed .
however , my computer ( and phone ) were connected to the internet .
