this thing is really really cool  .
i gave one to my friend on st  .
pattys day since its green and his bday is actually on st  .
pattys day it is perfect  .
anyhow i use the same one in black and love it  .
it just plain and simple rocks the socks if you need an mp3 player  .
i found mine for 99$ at priceforsure  .
com and ever since i have got it my life is better  .
how  .
music is on tap whenever i need it  .
lots of music  .
enough done  .
when the ipod nano came out it is very impresive with a hip style  .
from the first to the fith generation this i belive is a great advancement in the technology  .
the color difference and sleek designs have made it really portray the customer  .
the programs with the gaming , video , storage , audio controller , easy use , customization , picture view advancements , graphic ability , speed , and to rap it up with the parental settings for protection  .
the screen resolution is very sheek and the increased screen size has made it sharper to see  .
the video enhancements and program features have made the ipod programs fun and exciting to view  .
all in all with the price , color choice , gigabytes , and sleek look it makes the fifth generation a kick ass little toy that dos not cost a arm and a leg .
its great , read my review on the silver ipod nano 5th .
incredible value for the money  .
16 gb , video , fabulous sound  .
what more could you want  .
amazing  .
it is about the size and weight of a credit card    easy to carry , yet so functional  .
the two things i wo not leave home without (my credit card and my ipod nano) .
this is ipod nano is small but packs alot of features  .
the camera could'v been in the top of the nano  .
easily smudges on the camera .
it does what it's supposed to do    in spades and it looks great .
i've owned an ipod touch 2g (32gb) and the 1st ipod classic (80gb) , and my new 5g nano (16gb) tops them both  .
the mic quality is excellent  .
i have steady hands and i'm not bothered by the location of it  .
the video effects are cool , but you can only select them before starting a video  .
the click wheel on this ipod is more 'polished' , so it makes scrolling 100 times better than on the ipod classic  .
it has many features that i'm familiar with on the ipod touch , like shake    to    shuffle , the accelerometer for cover flow , and the voice memo feature  .
one new thing about voice memos is the chapter feature  .
when recording , you can now click the center button to make a chapter end there , and when playing it back , you can skip directly to certain chapters  .
one of the included games (that i had previously never played) , called maze , makes perfect use of the accelerometer and has very good graphics  .
it is exactly like a few apps on the ipod touch  .
i like how you can play games on here in portrait or landscape , and can switch between the two at any time on almost any game  .
the new genius feature is good too , and i'm new to all the cool features you have when you press and hold the center button while a song is playing  .
this is the absolute best ipod for music playback and features , because if your ipod is on shuffle , and you like the song playing , you can go straight to that album or artist (using the menu that pops up when you hold down the center button) or let it decide what goes good with it , with genius  .
on a side note , i have a hd camcorder , therefore i did not purchase this ipod just because it can record videos  .
the sound and video quality are better than the iphone 3gs , but the iphone can take pictures and it has auto    focus  .
i highly recommend this ipod to any ipod nano or ipod classic users , and maybe even ipod touch users .
i had previously owned a sandisk e260 4g player that had served me very well but when i purchased a macbook pro is not compatible so i began looking at the ipod nano  .
the apple online store had factory refurbished 5th gen players in 8g on sale for $99 with free shipping and 1 yr warranty so i went and ordered one  .
i work on the road for my job and spend a lot of time behind the windshield so i really enjoy my mp3 player in the car on long trips and nano fit the bill  .
the sound is fantastic and all metal construction seems like it would hold up , although the polished aluminium appear it would scratch  .
the scree is small but crystal clear , and if you so desired would not have a problem watching short video clips  .
you would think they would put a flat back on the player , if you dont have a case for it and lay it on a desk or table it will rock back and forth  .
would have appreciated a wall charger to be included  .
the camera is ok for impromptu clips if you do not have a camera available or a phone capable to taking vid  .
also the camera cannot take still shots all in all for the price i would recommend this player  .
apple is running a special on refurbished 8 gig nano's for $99 that come with a full factory warranty  .
only think i can recommend is you get a case for it and decent set of aftermarket earbuds the stock ones are terrible , very uncomfortable  .
i finally did it i got my ipod integration man i got so tired of reaching on the passenger side seat just so i can skip to the next track so i tried the mount which made my car look ridiculous so i had to remove it i found a company that specializes in ipod integration they installed it and they even added an aux input for me this thing is great not only can i use my steering wheel or my radio to control it but it also displays all song info on my factory stereo not to mention its charging while it plays www  .
bftsync  .
com you should check the review section it is really informative  .
the sound quality is the indispensable factor here  .
ipod nano retained the stellar thinny sound quality which is quite familiar  .
if you like durable , with voice recorder , video recorder portable player then this is one of the options available updated  .
on nov 4 , 2009  .
i have had a lot of ipods in my time and i really think this is the best for athletes  .
the fm tuner option is great , i sometimes want a break from listeniing to the songs i have , i love the pedometer , works great , and i love that it comes in 16  .
i feel this is a great addition to my ipod touch .
i love ipods , my last is a fatboy (3rd gen) nano 8gig  .
i wish it had this feature set and 16gig's though this latest version , 5  .
5 i think , needed a software update out of the box , not a problem with apple as they are good with updates and keeping them coming  .
my problem is that after the update it became glitchy , i resorted to resetting the ipod and re    updating it , that resolved the glitch it's everything you would expect from apple , sleek , sexy , and works well  .
i wish the battery lasted longer between charges , and i love the idea of a speaker , the touch shares this feature , but the volume (even at it's loudest) can only be heard standing in a closet in a vacant house the nano is so small and thin that i think we would all have been happier with a better speaker , and a larger battery by making the nano a bit bigger  .
we're already at the point where if it is any smaller an adult would need a matchstick to operate it  .
i can see slipping next years ipod into a vending machine coin slot by mistake  .
we don't wear watches the size of a dime for a good reason , no one could see the time  .
i applied tiny adhesive felt circles to the back so i don't ruin the finish , four of them seem to stabilize it on rough surfaces if you keep it in your pocket make sure it's alone , keys and coins are likely to cut right through it on the brighter side it does what i need it to , sounds fine with a good headset or external speakers , video playback is fine if you're waiting in your car or a doctors office , but i'll be watching movies at home  .
(it is picky about the video formats and i'm not doing conversions for a 2  .
2 inch screen  .
if you want a recommendation , here it is ; if your hands are not large , and you order a case for it , you'll be very happy  .
keep a charger handy for video , or making videos , for music it's going to run eight hours or so apple has an astounding value retention , the second hand markets are charging , and getting , premium prices for two and three year old ipods , expect to pay 75% of retail for a second hand model i'm not willing to pay for shoddy , confusing operating systems , so the premium price on apple ipods is worth the money for me i've thrown away a dozen mp3 players out of frustration and anger before going to apple  .
i no longer complain about price , you get what you pay for i've decided to buy the new model ipod classic as my primary deice , my hands are kind of big and i like the feel of the classic , but this one is so innovative that i'll continue to use it when i prefer to be stealthy (church with my wife , riding in the car with only the left earphone in so my family cannot see it , etc  .
all joking aside this is good stuff , do not fear spending the money , it's worth it  .
updated  .
on jan 11 , 2010  .
overall it's a good product  .
i've been happily using my sansa clip 8gb for about a year now with absolutely no complaints  .
i received my 5th gen ipod nano as a gift and is exstatic (i love consumer electronics)  .
here i now have this silver treasure that looks so star wars i could cry  .
small and light and , dare i say it , beautiful  .
i plug this shiny new baby in and see the colorful screen light up and i start to drool  .
then the magic ends first , i come to realize that although rhapsody and ipod say i can use rhapsody to transfer mp3s that i own , i cannot  .
only i tunes  .
itunes is okay but i like rhapsody or wmp because i can transcode my mp3s from 320 kps on hdd down to 128kps on my device and save some memory space  .
so if you like that kind of control , you're screwed the headphones that it comes with are nice to give to you're 5 or 6 year old to use with their leap frog  .
my sony ear buds helped the sound quality but nothing compared to my clip  .
don't get me wrong , it sounds okay , i've certainly heard worse but for the tech that is supposedly put into these things , i'd expect more gadgets  .
gadgets  .
gadgets  .
this little tool will play games , radio , voice and memo record , take video (do not expect much) , has a pedometer , stop watch and a handful of other handy dandies  .
none of which enhance my music experience  .
they're all quite novel and fun but grow old quickly (like , on the same day) one thing i do like that my clip is not capable of is shake to shuffle  .
start your library up and give the nano a shake  .
i dare ya  .
shaking it will randomly select you a new song  .
of course , if i were jogging (who am i kidding , i have to increase my activity to be sedentary) that would be a problem  .
every footfall starts a new song summing it up  .
it's just okay for me (to quote a famous idol judge)  .
mine is free , and that sure helped but i'll probably keep right on using my trusty little clip  .
it has been washed , beaten , dropped and even slept on a time or two and still works as well as it did when i bought it (for $45  .
not $150)  .
i'll probably ebay the nano .
except for the software update and a video camera , it technically has not changed much  .
music quality still is not that great (esp if you use good earphones)  .
competitors player have better music quality esp flac support at relatively lower prices (and higher storage capacities)  .
nothing new to write about  .
each control has multiple functions  .
this means you are forever backing up to undo the thing you didn't intend but which is controlled by the same button that controls the function you did intend to do  .
desperately needs a power switch  .
it tries to guess whether or not you want the power on and mostly fails  .
so any time you turn the power off , you generally have to do it twice  .
this is true even if you have the hold switch engaged as the apple software will ignore your clearly expressed wish to keep the power off       you put it on hold , didn't you  .
and why should power off require two actions in the first place       sleep + hold  .
if , as with me , you use the thing to listen to audiobooks , you will soon find an option in itunes to remember the place where you left off  .
trouble is it doesn't work  .
sometimes it will remember your place , but only if you do absolutely nothing else in the interim , and occasionally not even then  .
you cannot , for instance , go listen to something else for a minute and then come back  .
it will lose your place  .
you cannot install new media and then go back to listening to your book       the moment you sync with itunes it resets all your bookmarks to zero  .
how hard is it to set a flag and leave it  .
all of these issues have been part of the ipod experience since the very beginning  .
no one at apple ever bothers to debug anything once it is in the market  .
in the end , this is typical apple product       flashy , stylish , if you're 16 lets you pretend to be a genius , but in the core software functionality it is half baked and riddled with programming errors  .
it just does not do what it is supposed to do very well  .
it is one long sequence of minor irritations that add up to major frustration .
i took my ipod nano back to the shop before it got danaged  .
there is nothing sold to protect it against damage , nothing to protect the lend and the hole in front of the lens could get blocked  .
no way to attach a strap to prevent it from sliding out of your hands as it's small and light  .
i also found that the video that it created could not be edited by adobe premiere elements 7 video editor maybe the next generation of the nano will be better i would recommend it to anyone who makes a lot of videos for youtube as it's easy to use as a video camera and the video does not need to be converted for youtube .
terrible dont by  .
overall sucks ; most pros are outweighed by a con  .
lets start with the positive    it has a nice design , large display and a good user interface that allows good music organisation and relative quick track selection now the bad stuff     .
the camera sucks , didnt expect and i didnt buy it for that either luckily enough the mic isnt too good either  .
recording quality isnt great but i guess its a nice feat the camera and mic are in the worst place possible , the lens is bound to get smudged and taking photos or recording will require you to hold the ipod in an akward position now the real stuff , for an mp3 player i'm hugely dissapointed , whats up with the sound quality  .
its just bad  .
thats both on speaker and on earphones the limited storage capacity doesnt allow for a big music library so beware if you want large capacities go to the competitors , they have better sound quality too in general this product is very overpriced for what it is , i'd rather have a decent working ipod then a pice of   packed full of features that cant even store decent amounts of music or play your music with proper sound quality  .
unfortunatley me and apple dont have the same opinion on the matter so were stuck with the piece of   (ipod) the ipod has multiple function functions on the same buttons , this can be pretty confusing when youre trying ot get it to do something and it simply goes whacky on you and does something random no power switch is a pain in the ass , the ipod can and will turn itself on when you dont want it to it is also extremly fragile , a minor shock could disrupt it from working properly (this happened to a freind of mine , no personal experience involved here)  .
so handle it with extreme caution it has a speaker option that freaks out once in a while and plays your music both on speaker and on your plugged in earphones the line    in for the headphones is boud to have problems , i experienced this myself , i've just been shipped this piece of crap and the line    in   up all the time  .
the position of the headphone jack will activate the speaker , pause your music , lower the sound or stop playing sound in your earphones  .
line    in problems are frequent with ipods , it seems mine has a technical defect and i hope apple will replace it , but its not a one off thing , line    in problems have happened to more then one of my freinds with ipod nano (doesnt matter the generation , it seems there must be a design flaw) i excercise regularly and i do not reccomend this to anyone who will use it to excercise why  .
because of the line    in problems that will eventually arise , it is the most fragile part of the ipod and badly designed , it cannot withstand pressure  .
movement if you are jogging , dancing whatever you use it for , will put pressure on the line    in  .
this will not only   you off during your workout as the music is randomly paused or set on speaker mode but it will also damage your ipod's line    in and that can be costly to repair  .
if you have no warranty its ok you can replace the line in yourself , there are plenty of guides on how to do so well there we have it  .
i do not recommend this product , i recommend the cheaper and better quality competition products , however if you want a gadget filled with crappy features you'll never use but look cool such as bad sound , a bad camera , a mediocre mic , a photoviewer a calerder etc , then go for this   ) .
waste of money  .
WELL I GOT MY IPOD AT A GREAT PRICE TO BEGIN WITH AND IT WORKS WITH MY BFT PREMIUM HANDS FREE SYSTEM "LOOK MA NO WIRES" AND MY WIFE GOT HER IPOD INTEGRATION IN HER TOYOTA AVALON SO IT WORKS; VERY DELICATE SO YOU WANNA BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS DEVICE THEY SELL CASES AND SKINS FR IT AT WWW.BFTSYNC.COM
Its great, read my review on the silver Ipod Nano 5th.; Its great, read my review on the silver Ipod Nano 5th.
Lots of gadgets if the product actually worked.; After only ONE day, the scroll wheel doesn't work.
Small, keeps the fanboys happy; Implements Jobs' no-buttons fetish; riddled with mode errors; software forgets where you left off
Perfect music keeping device!; No cons! Perhaps more space would be nice for some people but this is good for me!
1. Nice visual design.. 2. Nice screen.. 3. Few fun gadgets.; 1. Itunes ball and chain.. 2. No bitrate conversion support.. 3. Only par sound quality (come on! give it some muscle!). 4. Too delicate! I'm afraid to use it except when I'm sitting down.. 5. Did I already say Itunes Ball and Chain?
Always there when I need it. Just the right size, with the right functions. No sixth generation for me!; Short battery life.
Excellent sound, crystal clear screen, lots of features, appears to be tough aluminum construction; The back of player is rounded and does not sit flat table or desk surface. No wall charger in box. Mediocre vido camera that cannot take still shots. Really uncomfortable earbuds.
superior sound, nice interface from creative, sleek, good ergonomic design; fragile and prone to slide, no flash swap, needs itunes to transfer music and videos and is quite tedious. smooth sounding effect still can't beat the newer creative zens.
-Nice design. -Cool use of scrole wheel. -Great Video camera, even if its VGA. -Nice earbuds. -Great colors. -Nice shape. Glass screen. -Polished Aluminum metal; -Scrool wheel a bit too sensitive for my liking. -Glass invites glare. -Nice camera but, doesnt have zoom. -doesn't take pictures. -Sound Quality so-so. -Camera has the worst placement ever
- This iPod has a very practical user interface(same as any other ipod). -Its slick, has a nice design and is pretty flashy.. -It has a camera. -It has a speaker option. -It has a microphone. -It has a relativley large display; -This iPod :. -has very poor sound quality. -has limited storage capacity. -is very overpriced and overrated. -has multiple functions on the same buttons. -has a very badly placed mic and camera. -is very fragile. -is often shipped with technical defects
Everything and especially the pedometer, fm radio and alarm clock. Super organization as usual for Apple.; Video lens placement. Would be nice to include digital camera capability. Not really necessary
- Updated software. - Simple and easy to use user interface; - Updated software that should have been included in the beginning!. - Lousy earphones!. - Music quality is still so-so!. - Still relatively pricey!. - Limited capacity to 16Gb!. - Lacks support for FLAC file format!
Good video camera. Easy to use. Useful for making videos for YouTube. Small and light. Radio and voice recorder are useful; Won't charge up on the iTrip. Won't work on the Altec Landing im600 speaker system. Can't buy anything to protect it against damage.. No way to attach a cord to the unit.. Battery last's for 1 hour when recording to video continuously.
Well The Only Thing Is The Color!; Haha! Well First Its Froze on me three times in the last three months! its a finger print magnet! the video camera ***********! the eq is terrible! the video quality is also yeah you guessed it terrible! photos are half bad but still is terrible.....
Everything Apple has ever made deserves an award for design and innovation.. Love the Radio with live pause.. Interface a five year old could learn.. Solid software, very stable.(see more below). Good screen resolution, if a bit small.. Tons of features.; Easily scratched, but looks great new.. I wish it were flat, it rocks when on a table top, it's oval diameter makes using the wheel and pushing buttons difficult when not in your hand.. Love that it has a built in speaker...wish I could hear it.
The size and the extra features. I go to the gym 4 times a week and thought this would be best for me. I have an IPOD touch which I love and will keep, but I love the pedometer which works great and the fm tuner.; After having a touch it took me a few days to used to the click wheel, video quality though the camera is easy to use.
Its sleek design is stylish with a deep rich color scheme. All of the different options and apps to use on this latest ipod is smooth surfing of Enterntainment. I love the gaming, movie, picture, gigabyte capsicity, and easying ability's to use.; The one problem many have found is that ipods is the battery or screen being fragil, another problem of it freezing when it gets full of memory. My suggestion is to add a upload for a app which will control the battery life spand.
I love the new radio feature, with its retro look. The video recording quality is average at best, but it is intended to be used for quick videos. See the Bottom-line summary (below), because I don't have enough room to type everything here.; When filming videos indoors, it's VERY dark. The sound quality is ok, but you can't record a silent video; it will pick up a soft constant noise. I sold my iPod touch, expecting a much better one 9/9/09. All I got was this, but I'll get the 4G touch.
