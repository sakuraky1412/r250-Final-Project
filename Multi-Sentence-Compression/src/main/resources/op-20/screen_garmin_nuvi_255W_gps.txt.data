Sufficiently sensitive touch screen
> Better screen touch sensitivity
The home screen shows four options :
Screen is clear and maps are pretty easy to follow .
3 inches screen and steady performance .
Also, push every icon on every screen you see .
3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .
Screen size is good and I didn't want one that had blue tooth and a lot of 'extras' I wouldn't use .
> More responsive that my old 760  , plus a better looking screen
> Same screen size as the other 4 .
3 Love the touch screen technology
,  Its a touch screen and a 4 .
The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .
The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .
When attached to the PC, the screen just indicates the connection .
I had a Nuvi 205 and I really liked it but I wanted a bigger screen .
The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .
On the 750 the zoom buttons are on opposite sides of the screen .
I can even see the screen without my reading glasses .
The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .
