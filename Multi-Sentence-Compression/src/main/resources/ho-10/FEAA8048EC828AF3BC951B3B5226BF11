the pictures of the swimming pool on the site that enticed us must have been taken on a unique day , because every of the 4 days we were there , the water was dirty , troubled and one could not see the bottom of the pool even where the pool is only 80cm deep .
very disappointed : poor service , dirty pool and facility : go there at 9am and asked if early checkin was possible , reception responded that the guests of our room ( river front bungalow at about usd100 a night , booked for 3 nights ) has not checked out .
before that upon arrival , as we had traveled , i wanted to wash my hands and asked for the toilets of the lobby/restaurant , and was taken to a mediocre place that was worn down and had not been cleaned for years .
so i insisted and receptionist then said that yes room was available but we would have to pay usd10 to check in early , which we paid in the end .
and the service was always arrogant and rude , when we would ask for a towel for a kid or asked for shower gel when housekeeping forgot to restock .
i insisted twice and was given a soap dispenser taken from the kitchen that was as scary as the rest of toilets , and was dirty as hell . . .
an go for breakfast early because once items run out on the buffet , they would not restock or delay restocking so the limited supply would be even more reduced .
i waited a few days after staying there before posting this review , just to have make a calm and balanced assessment as i was furious from check-in to check-out .
i checked the room in question through the window door : it was made up and ready for checking in and no luggage was in the room .
the last day , after the jug of passion fruit juice was empty they just replaced it with artificial flavor orange juice that is undrinkable by any decent standards .
