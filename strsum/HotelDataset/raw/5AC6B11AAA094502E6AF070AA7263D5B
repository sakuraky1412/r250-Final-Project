so why do people come here is it• the food ?
no !
• the service ?
no not really !
• the quality of the rooms ?
no !
• you’re attending a conference , possibly !
• the location ?
definitely !
• the challenge here the hotel can only go on so long counting on this .
there was a relatively cheap remodel about 5-6 years ago , they even had staff doing the painting !
unfortunately , the cut price version means now the hotel really looks it age .
• sadly they’ve also closed the john craig clothing store in the lobby also now which was a great little shop .
• the valet guys , coffee shop ladies and mavis in the gym are still here and delivering a great service .
• i stayed in sept with my family were supposed to be here for 2 weeks as we’ve been coming here for a number of years , but hurricane irma came along a few days after we arrived unfortunately .
the hotel wasn’t that busy and instead of really helping international guests we were provided with zero help from the hotel which is actually both shocking and shameful .
• we kept asking for information and got almost nothing but we had the feeling the hotel would suddenly decide they would close and provide us with limited warning .
thankfully we decided not rely on the hotel at all and made our own arrangements when we told them they then said oh yes we are going to close sorry .
then to cap it all we got a note under the door night which was actually a staff announcement telling them the emergency numbers to use .
so a professional hotel could not even be bothered to write a specific note to their guests instead a generic staff announcement , how lazy are they here , seriously ?
it’s a shocking example of a poor gm which allows such poor lazy standards to exist with such a shocking lack of care for their customers .
luckily , we took our own initiative and checked out ahead of time and made our way up to washington over the next 48 hrs by car before the hurricane hit but with zero help and communication from the rc naples management team .
i would be personally and professionally ashamed if i knew i had let international clients down this badly as there were so many ways they could have provided basic information to the few clients staying at the time .
some lovely staff but it’s a moderate 4 star marriott hotel with high 5 star prices and a management team that clearly don’t care very much about their clients , which is shame given it’s such a lovely location .
