the navigon 2100 gps navigator is an exceptional unit for the money  .
it can be had for 70  .
00 usd (used) from amazon and retails for around 150 to 200 usd it's no frills menu is easy to read and use  .
there are plenty of settings that allow you to customize the 2100 to suit your needs  .
for the price , it gives you a lot more to customize than some similarly priced units i've seen  .
you can have this thing show almost any point of interest you want (schools , churches , restaurants , etc  .
) at no extra cost the graphics on the 2100 are great , too  .
streets are shown in yellow    white while the route is shown in bright orange  .
it shows lakes , ponds , creeks , and rivers  .
the night view can be adjusted for brightness and more realistic than tomtom's blue background)  .
the unit quickly recalculates your route if you decide to veer off or make a side stop  .
it can get a little nagging if you don't follow its directions , though (but they all do  .
) both my brother and sister    in    laws and my son all have varying versions of the tomtom and none of them work as well or look as good as the navigon its best feature is the text to speech  .
it doesn't just tell you to turn left or right , which with most gps units , can be too late (as a previous reviewer noted  .
) the navigon gives you plenty of time as well  .
it will tell you in x miles or feet to turn right or left onto xx street  .
then again just as you approach the turn  .
the real view feature is a great addition to its functionality because it shows a graphic of the interchange and tells you which ramp to take  .
it even shows a graphic of the green sign you might see on the highway  .
it shows the number of lanes and points to the one you need to take  .
it's great  .
the text to speech is a little quirky  .
it tries to pronounce names as they are written so sometimes a street name will come up funny sounding  .
and the computerized delivery is a little annoying but not enough to make a difference unless you're listening for it i am a little disappointed that you cannot change the voice so you're stuck with an american female it charges from a standard cigarette lighter really fast  .
the battery life seems a little short to me  .
it lasts about 3 hours on my unit  .
i do not know what the expected life is but my son's tomtom lasts almost 5 hours  .
leaving it plugged in is a tiny nuisance overall , i would rate the navigon 2100 gps navigator 10 out of 10  .
its superior , bright graphics and no frills operation is perfect given the total cost of this unit  .
for less than a comparable tomtom or garmin , plus a single cost lifetime traffic update service (that's less than tomtom's annual subscription fee) , the 2100 is a definite alternative  .
add the text to speech and the fact that it warns you long before your turn make this clearly the best gps out there updated  .
on jan 1 , 2009  .
i am retired ; i am on a fixed income ; and i am cheap  .
so , up until now i have used mapquest without any intention of buying a gps  .
staples had a sale on this unit , plus a rebate and i had a coupon , so my final price is $75 with free one day shipping to boot  .
before i purchased , i read all the reviews i could find and there is nothing i couldn't live with i am happy to say that i have had none of the problems or complaints that people who wrote negative reviews had , except as noted below  .
it may just be the luck of the draw when i first got the unit , i set it to the optimal route setting as is advised by several reviewers  .
with all the features and options , it is like playing with a toy whenever i use it  .
since i cannot say enough positive things about it in the space provided , i will focus on the few minor negative aspects identified in the cons section sometimes it takes a minute to pick up a signal and other times it can take several minutes  .
i usually turn the unit on ten minutes before leaving my house  .
it picks up the signal in the house before i get in the car  .
if i am leaving from another location i can sit and wait for the signal or start driving in the general direction i need to go and the gps gets me back on track when it gets signal before i've gone very far if you are on abc road and that road turns left at an intersection , and xyz road starts if you go straight across the intersection , there will be no voice prompt to tell you  .
it does show that the road turns on the map though  .
keep an eye on the map and this won't be a problem and if you don't it will reroute you correctly anyway i did not complain about the small letters or the volume because i mount it high on the windshield so the gps is above my rearview mirror close to my eyes and ears in actual use i found that when going to a restaurant in ny it wanted to take me a little out of my way by avoiding a shortcut i know  .
however , this may be intentional because the shortcut is winding with a 30 mph speed limit  .
on the other hand , it has found a shorter way to get to my daughter's house in nj  .
i originally got those directions from mapquest the other night i went to a concert in reading , pa and the highway signs told me to take the second exit 1/4 mile away for the arena  .
i is stuck in concert traffic moving about a tenth of a mile every five minutes and i is 1  .
3 miles away  .
however , the gps told me to get off at the first exit and it took me through traffic free streets  .
in a few minutes i is in the concert traffic again , but only  .
3 miles away  .
i got to the concert just as the warm up act started thanks to the gps  .
on the way home , though , i is on a state highway and is told to make a left onto a ramp which was not there  .
then , when i continued straight , the road i is on disappeared from the map  .
it looked like i had become an off road vehicle  .
but i is going in the right general direction and continued  .
after about 5 minutes of driving on the missing highway and constant recalculating of the gps , it finally found me and rerouted me  .
i got home only 1 or 2 minutes later than i would have so , why did i rate the navigon 2100 so highly  .
the purpose of a gps is to get you from point a to point b and it does that at a fantastic price and includes many bells and whistles found on much more expensive units  .
its faults are too minor to consider in the rating .
i own a garmin nuvi , and tom tom along with the navigon 2100 and the navigon 2100 kicks them out of the water  .
i live in la so if you are going to make a lane change you need to know about it more than 20 feet ahead  .
the garmin nuvi is horrible on this feature , it only displays the next turn on the screen and often let's me know that i need to go in the left lane or exit left when its already way to late to make the change  .
also , navigon has reality view so when you need to change lanes on the freeway or exit to another freeway , you see all the lanes along with an arrow of which to follow  .
this feature is great as the garmin and tom tom often have a different name for the off ramp or freeway than the overhead road signs display  .
also the tom tom and garmin always tell you to take the north or south ramp (in cases where there is one exit and then a split for north or south) after its too late and you have already had to choose a lane  .
this never happens with the navigon because you see the actual lanes on the screen with the road sign recreated overhead and an arrow pointing out the right lane  .
the navigon is so great with its on screen written directions and reality view graphics that i can drive with the stereo blasting because i don't even need to listen to the voice directions  .
the navigon 2100 also says street names  .
map updates are much cheaper for the navigon than for garmin or tom tom  .
moreover , you pay 75    90 for life time traffic  .
garmin and tom tom charge that every year  .
in sum , the navigon is the best gps on the market today  .
its cheap because they do not waste your money giving you mp3s and picuture storeage feature (who would use a gps to store pictures and music    garmin and the cnet reviewers seem to think people will    nerds of a feather i guess)  .
i travel a lot and have to use the garmin and magellen gps at avis and hertz respectively  .
these also suck  .
they are so bad and so late with turns that i am buying another navigon for travel  .
10 out of 10 navigon 2100  .
i also have a high end garmin gps and bought this unit for my wife who also travels  .
i bought it largely because of it's compact size  .
i have tested this unit quite intensively and would have to fabricate a negative comment  .
it does everything , and more , that my garmin does .
i have used tom tom , garmin , navman and i still have my old medion work horse but for value for money and the range of features and updates you get with th 2100 i don't think there is much to beat it  .
i am uk based and it has no problems with updating route changes or fast turn a round on new routes online stuff via fresh is great and hassle free  .
anyone having problems is either very unlucky and has a bad one or you haven't read the instructions at around ï¿½87 ( $128 approx) you wo not buy better for the price .
this is the 2nd best selling gps car navigator in february  .
the quality of the map display with it's reality view is it's best feature  .
as a complex intersection is reached the display changes from 2d/3d to reality view  .
this produces a more life like representation of the intersection including the wording on the overhead signs  .
where available it can display the speed limit in the style of the country it's used in the turn indicator shows not only which direction the next turn is , but what the intersection looks like  .
within one half mile it shows an approach distance indicator showing precisely where to make the turn spoken directions are provided at varying distances to a turn based on speed  .
at highway speed at 2 miles the first spoken advice is in 2 miles bear right onto interstate 95 for example  .
the navigon pronounces the street names  .
after a couple of more warnings at the precise point of turning it announces , now bear right onto interstate 95  .
it's hard to miss a turn the unit offers three route modes , fastest , shortest and optimal  .
it also has a bypass feature for road blockages allowing different distances for re    routing  .
it recalculates the route quickly when the driver takes a wrong turn there are seven pages of basic setup options and additional settings for route options including whether car , bicycle or walking routing it has a feature to automatically vary the speaker volume based on the noise in the automobile  .
i had mine set to the lowest volume it has different brightness settings for day and night  .
both have variable brightness  .
day/night is changed almost instantly from a menu that is displayed by touching the screen when in navigation mode the navigon features points of interest with brand named graphics  .
i is very amused by the mcdonald and amoco symbols (and others)  .
the poi search feature works perfectly and can be used to find poi along the route with ease  .
it displays the distance to that poi and quickly routes to it  .
i used the poi near my position function to find a fuel station with diesel for my car i used the search near a city feature to find a hotel and make reservations from over 100 miles away  .
it routed me directly to the hotel the 2100 has a built in traffic receiver  .
i do not need this feature and did not use it  .
the traffic service is an optional extra  .
so are poi provided by the zagat survey which include the zagat ratings the unit does not come with a charger for in home use , but it functioned with a usb cable from my nikon camera the suction cup mount is very easy to use and very steady  .
the gps unit mounts and dismounts almost instantly with no difficulty whatever  .
i carried the 2100 in my pocket when not in the car and programmed it on it's battery when not driving  .
i programmed it indoors by being near a window the map data let me down a couple of times  .
navigon uses navtek maps  .
on two occasions the map took me in a circle  .
navigon now offers freshmaps to regularly update map information before i purchased this device i had very low expectations and felt that most of the features listed by gps manufacturers had little value  .
i find that the navigon has just the features that i really need for traveling if i traveled for business i would opt for a more complex gps with a slightly larger screen , fm transmitter and blue tooth , such as the navigon 7100 one feature i noticed which is not documented (that i remember) is that navigation continued after contact with the satellites is lost  .
driving through tunnels under baltimore and hampton harbors did not stop the navigon from displaying my progress before i learned how to use itinerary planning this feature gave me a bit of problem  .
once i started to route based on relatively short way points to prevent routing to the fastest highways the unit did exactly what i wanted  .
i routed to town names  .
when i approached that town , i cancel the way point so that the gps continues on my route without hesitation  .
doing this on my return trip saved me over 2 hours there are optional settings for the types of poi that are displayed  .
there are displays for speed limit and warnings that can be set from 5mph to 20mph over the limit  .
when you drive over this setting the unit starts saying warning  .
i enabled speed , altitude , coordinate display , time to arrive , trip time while the unit also displays distance to the next turn and way point  .
the 2100 has a 3  .
5 display  .
when all the features are turned on , they do seem to crowd the screen a bit i is very impressed by the intelligent logic used to find addresses and poi  .
the unit gives a choice of street first or city first lookups  .
it intelligently displays and reduces the number of choices available from it's map data most of my driving is done at night  .
the unit is flawless  .
i've been lost in hampton , va at night before  .
this time it took me to the front door of the house i is visiting at times i switched to 2d mode  .
i find the 3d mode more pleasing  .
the zoom ratio when the gps shifts modes automatically is adjustable the navigon gave me the most enjoyable long trip that i've taken in many years  .
it kept me updated and on course  .
it far exceeded my expectations and needs .
i is in the market for a simple navigation unit  .
nothing fancy , no bluetooth , call answering , music playing , etc i just wanted navigation after researching the heck out 1/2 a dozen entry    level nav units (i'm an electronics nerd of course) , i opted for the navigon 2100 because of it's form , function , and its unbeatable $119 price tag from staples (special of course) the unit has a very sleek design  .
i is surprised at how clear the graphics were compared to many units in the same price range  .
i've seen many units where you can hardly read the cross    streets because the graphics are so grainy  .
not the case with this unit  .
clear graphics , bright screen , clear text  .
the mounting bracket is a bit clunky for the unit though and i always find myself struggling to get the unit on and off the cradle the routing is not bad either  .
i have not run into any situations where the unit has left me dry the optional lifetime traffic option is also offered at an amazing price  .
you can find it at amazon for less than $50 and it's a lifetime subscription you unlock in the unit  .
this has saved me from being stuck in traffic many times the navigation itself is great  .
the screen has this really neat zoom feature that zooms in when you're going slow and zooms out as you speed up  .
you can of course turn this off  .
the unit has reality view , a pretty neat feature if you're unfamiliar with the freeways/highways in the area  .
this feature will show you exactly which lane to be in to properly merge into when hitting a junction or an exit all    in    all , if you're looking for an entry    level unit without all the bells and whistles , i think this unit is your best bang for the buck .
great gps on sale at staples for 119  .
i took me 3 months to buy this , i first started looking at it on september , when it is advertised on time magazine , is going to buy on black friday , but wife did not want one  .
i bought mine on x'ams i read all reviews , i like doing research before buying something , and my feeling after reading them all (i went through 4 web sites) is that this had a lot of potential and that a lot of users did not really use it before jotting down their thoughts i have used nuvi 350 , and 670 before and i thought they were the best , i is wrong nuvi takes to long to link onto satellites , over 2  10 (twice it took over 20 minutes , i am not kidding) with navigon it has not taken me more than 2  10 (the shortest 1  50) even on a rainy day comparing the 350 against the 2100 (had them both in the car) the 350 showed the same route , same distance  .
the nuvi showed a shorter eta than the navigon , but while driviing the nuvi will go up as far as being user friendly goes , i preffer the navigon , its more like windows , and although the navigon is pretty much standard like the other manufacturers , the navigon is really easy to get used to and faster the reviews that i read daid that the navigon took sometime to show the addresses while typing , that is because it shows the options , narrowing them  .
something that can be construed as a nuisance , but its not the 3d really view is awesome , my wife likes it , now she can drive herself on the instersate without having to call me , and ask me what exit to take  .
i wish i had the 7100 , for bigger view , but its too pricy  .
the speed warning feature is good , i like it the cons   pois , no post offices and no fire departments car mount is good but does not have the ball behind the mount , therefore you can only move side wise and not tilt it .
the navigon 2100 has features that some of the higher priced units do not have  .
the graphics are awesome  .
if you're looking for a good gps unit at a decent price , this unit's for you  .
i received the 2100 as a gift and love it  .
the size is perfect for my smaller car and the screen is amazingly accurate for the size  .
there is one negative review on cnet about not being able to find a town in illinois , but i is able to find it in less than 30 seconds  .
i love it  .
just as nice as my sister's new garmin  .
i love the unit  .
i've never had another gps , so i have no basis of comparison , but this unit is working great for me , espcially for the price ($149 at hh gregg with free traffic)  .
sometimes it gives a round about route , but nothing's perfect  .
i've found if i drive part of the route that i already know and then start navigation , it does a great job getting me there  .
i've tested the rerouting and it gives new instructions before i even make it to the next intersection  .
it picks up the satellites quickly  .
it's a bit harder to get a signal for the traffic system though  .
my biggest complaint is the lack of up to date poi's  .
i could live with the small number of them if they were more up to date  .
places that have been around for years do not even show up  .
i just read geebeess review i dont not know what he is doing but i put in mt prospect il it popped right up  .
this is a great gps .
for the price , it is better than some i tried for twice as much  .
i have run the list of lower priced gps  .
bought several and returned because i couldn't be satisfied  .
then i tried the navigon 2100  .
eureka  .
even have a way to correct tts mis    pronunciation of streets names  .
navigon doesn't tell that part but there is a text file on the sd card mn6\sound\sara_21_tts\lxen    uso for special pronunciation rules that can be extended to correct the way streets names are pronounced  .
it's a little trick with the use of letter keys  .
works great  .
just be careful if you try it  .
do not change any existing entries  .
just add new ones at bottom  .
study carefully to figure out letter combinations to use i have never seen a gps tts that is correctable until now i would recommend navigon to anyone .
i bought this unit for 149 at staples , and for me , i dont think you could find a better value for the money  .
loud , clear , text to voice is great , the display works very well , quite bright  .
the only thing i had to work on is the points of interest  .
after playing with it for a bit though , it works quite well  .
another nice option , is upgradability for access to live traffic reports  .
all the important points to buying a gps unit are here with the navigon 2100 .
this is an awesome unit for the introductory level considering that most introductory level gps units do not offer street names (text to speech) where this navigon 2100 does  .
i is able to buy this for only $150 on black friday and that included lifetime traffic updates    so i'm very happy for the deal that i got pros cons mentioned briefly above highly recommend .
i got this for $99 from staple in black friday  .
i did not expect much for this price and i may return when i ordered it  .
finally , i got the unit 2 days ago and i believe it is as good as navigon and garmin  .
i really like the turn by turn list function  .
i compare it with yahoo map  .
navigon is as good as yahoo direction i had tried lot of gps and returned most of it  .
for this time , i will keep navigon gps for sure .
this device is worth its money no doubt  .
the interface is a lil slow which a lot of people complain about , but once you get used to it , its not that bad  .
i havent experienced route calculations to be slow  .
traffic updates lifetime for $99    thats incredible  .
this has a lot of features which anyone can use if you read the manual  .
they are not very complex  .
i would certainly recommend this to anyone who are directionally challenged like me or want to navigate with ease  .
i purchased the navigaon 2100 at office depot a couple days ago for an amazing $149  .
regular price is $249 but this week office deport is offering a $100 instant rebate  .
i also own the garmin nuvi 680 with blue tooth , photos , mp3s and after using the 2100 for three days , it gives me better route calculation then the 680  .
signal strength is better and rerouting is faster and the unit does not tell you that it is recalculating  .
it just does it  .
i love this feature  .
i do not think you'll be disappointed  .
read the online manual on the navigon web site  .
also reality view is cool and during travel of a planned route you can press the directional arrow to hear the instructions repeated  .
i love it  .
i live in northern virginia and it works great  .
no real problems  .
call navigon support and they will email you a form to complete and return to get free lifetime traffic .
for the price and accuracy it performs well  .
purchase map updates the us maps change all the time never ending road construction in metro areas .
we know it is a pretty simple installation project , but as this mount is a little pricey for what it actually does , we thought we would post a series so readers can better decide if they really want to spring for the proclip system it is versatile and does look better than the typical windshield mounts  .

had a mio , returned it in less than a week  .
kept freezing up  .
pull over , reset , wait , go freeze , apply shampoo , lather rinse repeat  .
mio no go had a magellan  .
dont get a magellan  .
i is so frustrated with it's slow satellite time    you miss your turns because of a 3 second delay  .
i bought this navigon 2100 the day after i shattered my magellan on the street from pure frustration  .
the navigon has a lot of my wish list features that kept making me return the other gps's asks for clarification to duplicate addresses  .
very cool hancock street in boston can be beacon hill , charlestown , dorchester  .
nav 2100 asks you to choose one  .
other gps (mio) just took me towards charlestown  .
if you know boston , charlestown and beacon hill are very different dorchester and beacon hill too  .
hood vs hills usb charger    handy for motorola users   same charger for cell and gps battery life is long  .
i got 3  .
5 hours on it  .
has warning bars as it depletes bad   wont charge and use at the same time but it charges quickly 15minute charge will get you 45run time had i known , i would have bought 3 (brother and mom could use this)  .
if you get it for under $100 (you da man  .
) under $150 is a good deal $200 and youre pushing the envelope of price staples has a 2week return policy  .
test drive it yourself and then decide test ride other ones as well to compare options and what you want in a gps they're not all the same  .
this nav2100 had the set state feature (set to mass for now) can easilly change when i travel)  .
has the predictive text for choosing a street  .
you can choose street , then pick from towns or miami vice versa gives you a quick overview as it calculates (shows a yellow arrow from you towards destination)  .
tells you the name of the street to turn on to best part   tells you to turn 15feet before you hit the turn point so you dont overshoot the turn  .
that is key  .
i killed my magellan because it didnt do that im keeping this one for a long time navigon is my go    to gps company if this one ever dies or i lose it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  .
look , you're my best friend , so do not take this the wrong way but , in 20 years if you're still livin' here , comin' over to my house , watchin' the patriots games , workin' construction , i'll f kin' kill ya  .
that's not a threat , that's a fact , i'll fu kin' kill ya .
i is a first time user and really didn't have too much frustration in setting it up  .
the new update helps a lot  .
it seems to recalculate quicker  .
a friend has a garmin and often gets frustrated because it does not say street names or tell you often enough what the execution will be  .
the version with traffic really helps  .
finding alternate routes with the settings can be problematic  .
overall works pretty well , except that it can freeze from time to time , but if you get it install the updates  .
i love this gps  .
it has gotten me everywhere i need to be  .
even amazed how the 3d works  .
i would recommend it .
pretty good device for the price  .
bought it from staples with $10 coupon for $128 including tax  .
works great , should include little more detailed users manual that would make it easy for people who are new to gps  .
overall a pretty good device , would recommend it to anyone .
navigon2100 physical design is good  .
it takes a little bit of time knowing to get use with the unit  .
functionality wise , is excellent  .
tested this unit  .
first test , i followed the direction going to a certain address  .
it perform excellent  .
text to speech instruction is clear and giving enough room before heading up to the next turn  .
it actually announced the real name of the street not just the distance before the turn  .
there is also an indicator on the left hand corner of the unit telling how far before you get to the turn  .
reality view is fantastic considering the price category  .
second test  .
i tried my own route just to test how fast this unit can recalculate the route  .
i performed good again  .
in about 2    3 seconds , the new route is established  .
tried this rerouting 5 times in a row  .
it did well  .
fyi update is also available which improved more of its functionality  .
this is a good buy  .
i am satisfied .
got mine at staples on blackfriday for $99  .
excellent deal  .
works fine , but is a bit slow on bootup to acquire satellite lock , but once locked , its fine all the way through trip interface could be better , and is a bit slow to respond  .
you need patience w/ this device  .
if you're looking for simple routing of any trip , no problem at all , but if you like to push buttons quickly , this is not for you they did come out w/ a rom update just yesterday    v1  .
1 , so it might resolve some of the issues  .
i got free traffic    updates , and it works great  .
i do recommend this product if you can get it at a good price .
bought unit for $99 (black friday special)    view zooms in or out based on your current speed , 2d and 3d views , complex intersections are shown in real life views , recalculates routes fairly quickly , i changed route mode to optimum and routing improved for me  .
unit remembers previous locations so it is easy to create bookmarks  .
map seems to be about 2 years old so an updated map is needed for this unit .
stood in line at 4  30 am on black friday (in freezing weather) to purchase a comparable competitor for $99 (mio c220) , it announced turns but not street names which got confusing eventually i returned it and got the navigon 2100 for $149  .
the graphics are better than anything else out there on the market , and it announces turns and street names  .
do not believe the hype about the big 3    garmin , tom tom , magellan whatever  .
they might have more control over the market and more slection but so far this product is doing excellent for me and i would recommend .
i have used it for couple of days only  .
but is very easy to setup  .
less than 30 seconds for initial startup  .
clear text to speech  .
3d view is great free life time traffic update       wow  .
all this for $99  .
how can you beat it i wish it came with 4  .
3 screen .
overall i think this is a great unit for the price  .
it has some of the features that make other units a lot more expensive  .
like the text to speech spoken street names there is virtually no setup  .
i is ready to go right out of the box  .
for the most part i have left all the factory settings whats i really liked is the price  .
i did get it on black friday for $99 bu ti'd be happy to pay 50 or some more to get the spoken street names  .
it also has free traffic and some traffic alerts  .
oh and the suction cup stics to my window no problem the few things i do not like are 1 the cord is a bit shorter then i like  .
i wish it had about a foot more  .
there is a delay sometimes after you choose something on the screen  .
its a pain if you are trying to type fast but i got used to it pretty quick  .
and last it might be my area under some trees but sometimes its slow to pickup the gps signal if you are looking at 2 units and thsi is the one with the traffic and spoken names pick this one up .
it is very good  .
i used it while driving from atlanta to new jersey and viceversa  .
it showed me good lane guidance , speed limits and a good route planning (i made frequent stops all the way) voice guidance is also very good and it alerts me well in advance (about 2 miles in advance when you travel at good speeds) it is accurate about 100 ft  .
it immediatly recongnizes when you take the exit , but it takes a liitle while to recalculate the route  .
but for $150 (bought from staples) it has got lot of features when compared to other costlier models totally , i recommend it atleast for first time users or budget travellers .
this is a great value gps  .
i got it for $99 at staples on black friday  .
at $150 , it is still a bargain  .
that price included the free traffic updates  .
overall a great simple system that will meet most people's needs  .
most gps units have a lot of unneeded features , raising the price  .
this one has basic features (navig poi) and includes the lifetime traffic updates for free  .
the system is sometimes a little slow to react to inputs but overall does a good job  .
icons are sometimes hard to hit because they are small  .
i use a golf tee as a stylus for quick accurate input  .
screen resolution and size are good  .
i like the 3d view of maps  .
the reality view is also a nice feature  .
will do an automatic recompute of your route when traffic snarls occur  .
way cool  .
overall , a good gps receiver and a great value .
i have had it for about 4 days and i like it  .
yes the garmin and tomtom have more features but you pay for those things  .
i don't want/need a gps unit that plays mp3's and shows pictures  .
i wanted a unit that had text to speach , multi route , and is compact  .
i did not really need traffic updates but if i change my mind i can add it later  .
this unit powers up and acquires the satelite usually close to 1 to 1  .
5 minutes here is my one gripe , the mounting arm to the windshield is hard to get the unit in and out of and the other downside is the power cord is seperate from the mounting thing  .
so everytime you want to take the unit off the windshield you have to take it off the mounting and then unplug it  .
no biggie  .
i like it , great price , great unit  .
i recommend it .
no brainer here to use this gps  .
i bought it as a refurbished on ecost  .
com ($92  .
00)  .
it worked the moment you turn it on but a little slow  .
it frozed on me a couple times but has been working well  .
directions are very accurate  .
pois coulda have been more  .
i pretty much like the 3d view and also the brightness on both day and night view  .
the text to speech sounds a bit robotic but pronounces street names fairly well  .
map updates are not free so i purchased a mapfresh subscription for 3yrs at $52  .
00 the cheapest i could find (reg price is $79 and up)  .
it doesn't come with a wall charger but can be charged with usb cable to your computer or car charger  .
my cousin bought a tomtom that cost more than my gps 2100  .
he likes mine better hehe oh yea one more thing , the address book feature for this gps does not say anything about how many addresses you can save .
on the surface this appears to be a great gps device for the price  .
it has excellent graphics , the reality view is helpful , it has a text    to    speech function (it tells you the name of the street to turn on vice just turn right  .
additionally , you can find an inexpensive traffic subscription online and that is a lifetime subscription this feature is fantastic , even lets you know when minor work is being done on a roadway (although that is obviously a function of whomever is updating the radio info) (caveat   i have updated with the version 1  .
1 software from the navigon website (which is supposed to do away with a lot of the u    turn directions) and my words below reflect this)  .
but , and this is a big but the routing is really screwy  .
the optimum choice gives the best routing , but there appears to be no rhyme or reason to where it wants you to go  .
sometimes it's spot on and other times will have you scratching your head  .
i recently tried to get to a starbucks in williamsburg va  .
i knew where it is and i knew how i would go using my directions , but i had time , so i decided to let the navigon direct me  .
it told me the starbucks is about 4  .
miles away (correct)  .
then i started driving , following the directions implicitly  .
after a little over 3 miles of touring scenic williamsburg it told me i is still 4  .
5 miles away (again correct) again , on a route that i normally use to get home , the navigon tells me to go another way (standard)  .
but once i pass the turn that the navigon wants me to take , instead of re    routing me it tells me to make a u    turn on a major road until i get beyond halfway home  .
only then does it re    route me  .
(as an aside , i have a magellan 3225 that tells me to take the route home that i normally take as the preferred route) there are some hacks on some navigon forums that people swear make the navigation better  .
i have not tried these yet , but then again , should i really have to hack a recently purchased gps device to give me better directions  .
bottom line   for the price this thing has some awesome features , but this is offset by the thought that i may be driving miles out of my way to get somewhere  .
on the bright side the device will get me to my destination eventually , which is what a gps device is supposed to do and if i'm in a strange city i wo not even know it's messing with me i cannot give it more than a 7 .
being a first    time gps user , the 2100 is fine function vs price    wise the editor's review is accurate overall  .
instructions are very sketchy does the reset button reset the software to out    of    the    box mode  .
no answer supplied recalculated routing okay , as i often chose alternate routes as more efficient .
i bought this the other day on sale at staples for $119 (down from a list of $250)  .
compared to the tomtom 3rd addition i used for a week (and is also an introductory model) this one has a slow response as the article nicely describes  .
while it can be used out of the box i uploaded the latest maps off the net and it is a real pain  .
the install instructions told me to check that the version i loaded is v1  .
1 but in reality the version is already up to 6  .
most of my travel is to/from work so this will be used on vacations and trips to see my kids  .
i just do not need all the bells and whistles  .
so this one is a good compromise on function and price  .
i've been using it to/from work to test it out and it's very similiar to the tom tom but it provides more reminders on when to turn which is critical at multiple junction intersections where you need to pick a lane well before the turn  .
but maybe tomtom has fixed this as it is 6 months ago and multiple software updates have likely been made  .
this is a small screen but no worry as it has voice commands and i used the screen only to confirm what it already told me .
i own a 2100t (not bf sale@staples)  .
first off , 2100 vs  .
2100t is  t  includes the traffic subscription here are my thoughts       first off , the unit is small , good    looking with a very effective car mount  .
upon startup , it acquires gps signal quickly  .
it can be protected with pin # against theft  .
the touch    screen can be calibrated  .
reverting to factory    settings are possible coming to more important stuff , one can search for an address using street name first , or city/zip code combination  .
the map included covers the 48 contig  .
states only  .
also , it's feasible to store 500 addresses in favorites for quick retrieval  .
1 good feature is defining a route having multiple points and being able to save the whole route combination itself  .
without gps signal , it's possible to review the route in a map , giving tts and turn    by    turn using  simulation  after putting in the address , and assuming gps signal is active , a turn    by    turn listing can be displayed , where even specific roads can be blocked  .
post blocking , the system can be made to re    route and then use that route for navigation  .
in terms of routing , there's considerable options available  .
fastest route , optimal route , shortest route , scenic route , avoid/allow/forbid tolls , avoid/allow/forbid highways , avoid/allow/forbid ferries , avoid/allow/forbid u    turns , mode for bicycle , car , truck or walking  .
while driving , taping the map it displays a  block  option , which is like  .
5 , 1 , 1  .
5 , 3 , 5 mile sketches , if activated , system auto blocks that sketch in front and tries to re    route alternative route (traffic congesion , etc  .
)    a very handy feature  .
option to switch from 2d/3d at tap of the map  .
however , what the unit does not do (some gps units do it) is detect your speed and if less than normal auto suggest detour options  .
the system display on the map the next turn and the turn    after (if almost immediate)  .
in fact , also if it's situation like  bear immediately left , after right turn  , etc  .
shows both of them , thus it's possible to detect earlier what's coming up  .
good feature  .
in case you missed what is said , tapping the turn icon again causes tts to kick in and repeat in case traffic is activated , which is for life and the charging cable must be plugged in , system shows a small icon on map , if clicked shows all active traffic information  .
again , can be configured to show only traffic relevant to route  .
furthermore , immediate traffic details are displayed on the map itself (radius approx  .
2 miles)  .
system can automatically route you thru alternative routes or can be made manual  .
a very +ve point being the subscription is lifetime , once bought    it's forever active  .
very powerful feature re    routing , in case of missed turns are quick but read issues below tts functionality has a single voice only (lady) and is of good pronounciation  .
nevertheless , there's some peculiarities , which one can get used to  .
generally , states to bear left , or keep to the left/right much earlier , gives clear road    names , very accurate in saying  now , turn right/left  etc  .
if there's multiple turns (city) avoids saying each every road name to avoid confusion  .
the speaker , however is on the low side  .
might have slight difficulty in hearing at high speeds  .
however , the system uniquely provides an important feature called auto volume increase with speed increase  .
very effective  .
in case you're going over speed    limit and you've configured to warn you if over 10 mph , tts does do a  caution  statement  .
the volume is configurable , directly from the map and can be muted too the map itself is highly customizable  .
it's possible to display speed limits , set warning if exceeing limit at city/highway levels and that too at 5 mph , 10 mph , 15 mph above limit settings  .
can show/hide altitude , speed , distance to destination , duration of travel , eta , compass , street    names  .
the display itself is bright (brightness can be configured , both at day/night levels separately) and has separate day/night views  .
note    the unit does not switch to night view automatically  .
the associate time settings are done automatically  .
the 2d zoom provides another important feature    auto    zoom  .
at higher speeds , etc  .
; system auto    zoom to cover more area , etc  .
the amount of zooming itself is configurable  .
there's a button providing further options like browing the map itself (pulling/pushing it up/down , left/right) , tapping a point on the map which showing details about that point and if there's any recorded poi at that point , etc  .
very good and nice  .
manual zooming of the maps is possible  .
however , locking the map    view preventing changes if accidentally tapped , etc  .
is not possible  .
the orientation of the map can be direction of travel (default) or always north the reality    view is very effective  .
it  kicks  in at critical junctures of travel , where there are complex turns involved showing clearly which lane to stick to , etc  .
however , keep in mind it's static and automatically appears  .
once turn is over , switches to map view  .
again the view can be turned completely off coming to pois , it offers a set of pois which can be searched and navigated to , from the main screen  .
there are multiple categories of pois and each almost always have sub    categories  .
the search can be based on  nearby  (if gps signal is active) ,  city  or  nationwide   .
once either of these options are selected , a search can be done based on category or sub    categories  .
if  nearby  , it displays a set of choices which can be expanded to include more radius  .
similarly at city (by city name or zip code) or nation    wide hunt of main corp  .
brands  .
further , there's a quick selection of critical categories at immediate availability for searching is possible    max 3  .
for example , parking , restaurants , wcs  .
the search is displayed as a list with up/down buttons and the keypad vertically oriented in the split screen  .
the keybad is abcd format which can not be changed to qwerty  .
auto completion is possible and active  .
the up/down arrows displaying the list are very sluggish and hang quite a lot  .
the actual icon for the brand    name is displayed alongwith the poi name  .
re    tying pois , changing categories/sub    categories , etc  .
are cumbersome and inefficient  .
the database is also very , very limited and does not include almost all major brands but are more inclined to include mom/pop shops  .
the pois can be made to display in the map itself and the types of pois to be shown on the map are configurable , the good part being they appear as icons on the map  .
my observation is it makes the map very cluttered  .
tapping the map provides an option to display immediate pois in vicinity or route and then adding such a poi as an intermittent route point  .
effective but the type of pois available by default (being low) makes this ineffective  .
a critical    ve point being users are not allowed to add their custom pois , or share other users' compilation , etc  .
you can only save the address as a favorite , for your personal use  .
separately ($40) a zagat survey lifetime subscription can be bought    which provides for zagat surveyed pois    an option to review the zagat ratings given for the poi in the system itself  .
i do not have it , thus can not comment pushing the top button causes immediately the product to go into standby mode , thus switching it on is very quick and good (activates the pin # option , for theft deterance)  .
it does not auto detect vehicle switch    off and thus has to be manually switched off the cons lies mostly with the poi database , sluggish search/display/modification options available  .
the next    ve point lies in the routing display  .
many a times , it'll display a rather zig    zag route with weird roads , etc  .
and need to be carefully reviewed (turn    by    turn listing) prior to embarking on the travel  .
on a personal note , users should always use the short route option by route    points are within city limits or short distances and optimal route if interstate travels  .
if route is missed , although re    routing is quick    again can be weird and can really take you on a trip down the highway  .
this is true also for automatic traffic re    calculations  .
there's supposed to be a firmwire update in january 2008 addressing this problem  .
on a lighter note , there's numerous others who have not reported any routing issues ; thus i think it's case    by    case basis and mostly to do with the navteq maps being used  .
a proof in the pudding lies in the fact that many    a    times the system will ask you to take an exit , go couple of miles and then re    join the highway again  .
this normally happens if system detects a portion of the highway to be  missing  in it's database    normally caused due to extreme compression of the maps itself (to fit into the sd card)  .
this is not pronouced much for 2100 , since it has only 48 states of us  .
but for higher models , i  .
5100 , 7100    which has the whole of na    it's more pronounced behaviour  .
also reported , in quite a few cases , the traffic , even if activated    does not work  .
you'll need to talk to support for resolving this  .
there are no media    players , headphone jack , ac adapter , pc update options for software/firmwire , cd/dvd containing help manual , etc navigon support    for me has been quick and good , while others have reported problems  .
again a case    by    case  .
they have quickly responded email queries too (24 hrs  .
turn    around time) .
for a first gps i think it is great  .
i , m sure there are others that work better or worse according with what you want in a gps i got mine at 179  .
00 total w/traffic  .
some got a steal at 99  .
00 the day after thankgiving  .
one suggestion that will help the processer  .
use a stylus or butt end of pen so you hit the icon right each time (icons are small for big fingers) it seemed to speed up things a little  .
the gps has been spot on accurate for me but i have had trouble with it in small towns where the roads/subdivisions are fairly new  .
( 1 to 3 years) in all fairness though the gps got me close enough to find what i is looking for  .
i think it maybe a small town/ who cares issue  .
i live in a medium size city and it has found everything  .
the map does need work though because we all go small now and then lol  .
hope this helps .
this is a great low priced gps system  .
it announces street names although may mispronounce them you should be able to figure out ahead of time , it lets you know where to find your point ie address on the right side of road  .
it recalculates quickly in my opinion  .
so far i think its not a bad sysytem i is able to buy mine for 161 total at staples , yes they have those too lol .
until my cell phone has a decent routing app , this is pretty sweet  .
$79 bucks  .
that's cheaper than two months of data services from at t  .
for now , a dedicated device is better in my book .
i bought this on black friday at staples for $99  .
set up is easy    i is able to put together minutes after leaving the store and use it to drive home  .
i agree with the findings of the other review in terms of the response time and entry of addresses the big problem is    the screen and map freeze up in the middle of most of my trips    annoying to say the least  .
i am planning to call customer service today  .
their resoponse will be a big factor in my decision to keep or return the unit .
i tested the 2100 along with a magellan 2000 and the magellan stayed on the proper course while the navigon 2100 made me get off main roads , take little side streets and then get back on the main road about 10 minutes out of the way  .
also , on a trip starting from my house , there is a very quick and direct way to the expressway  .
my megellan gets me there almost exactly the way i would drive  .
the navigon didnt and i had to go into the turn    by    turn directions and put a red x in some of the directions i didnt want only then did it figure out the way i wanted to go well it started to but then wanted to take me another way  .
the magellan is dead on with the directions i really wanted to like this unit but i think the magellan wins for the routing it takes you on which is dead on correct .
very good design , light weight , accurate , tmc is great since it comes free with the unit  .
reality view is in static mode once activated  .
another downside is search feature is cumbersome and the device keeps on hanging and you will need to reset it which makes it very annoying otherwise overall for the price and features it's good .
if it had not failed me (and i bought one for my father too which failed) it would have been great  .
both units get locked up in the opening menus and navigon wants more money to fix an inherent programming error on there part  .
not the best company procedure , had i known customer service is so poor , i might have reconsidered spending $400 on their products .
i like to shoot pool and it's like they were not even interested in it  .
took me out of the way  .
i actually inputted poi from my tom tom go 700 into it  .
the only reason i got this unit is cause the tom tom is bulky .
it is very unreliable  .
some times it may give you concise directions and other times you don't know what is going on  .
i is in dayton oh and it is giving me directions and street names in indianapolis , in  .
i did the update which took many hours to complete  .
i do not know what it updated , but it is still much the same as before  .
in cincinnait it went on recalculate when i went on a more direct route to my home and never came out of recalculate all in all a fair toy , but you better have a map handy when it goes off the deep end  .
poi pretty hard to access  .
takes me off an interstate to route me back on the next entrance  .
ie   route 35 in dayton , tells me to exit and then when i do , it tells me to enter route 35 .
they have a good system but there features need alot of enhancing  .
they show you the expressway but its not alway available  .
the icons may be in the way when you need to see your turn  .
i bought this sytenm at radio shack and radio shack is not even a poi for navigon  .
i suggest do not buy it  .
the company is still new  .
i read a good review of the 2100 so i went to buy one on black friday for $100 the store is sold out so i bought a mio c220 instead (also $100) i used the mio for about 3 months when i saw the 2100 on sale for $100 again and bought it because i still thought it would be better than the mio  .
what i found is that the 2100 is simply too slow for me to tolerate    even after the current updates were on it you have to wait between entering characters or you have to repeat the poi/address search because the 2100 cpu cannot keep up  .
the 2100 has better , brighter video but no automatic night mode    you have to change it yourself some folks have rightly complained about poor display levels in sunlight and poor power management on the c220    true on both counts    the 2100 is clearly better at both much of the satisfaction with a gps is very subjective so i wish the vendors would put honest simulators on their websites so you could decide for yourself how you feel about the interface  .
this would also give you an idea of whether the poi database is any good for your likely destinations  .
i test it where i live to verify accuracy of poi's and maps and the mio c220 does poorly on both    the 2100 seemed better  .
i reported 3 ridiculous errors to tele atlas but wo not hold my breath    they claim to follow    up with reports but have done nothing in 3 months i think the mio also comes with a better quality windshield mount (made in germany    no less  .
bought this because of the text    to    speech function for a great price  .
took a 70 mile all expressway trip and unit is taking me off the expressway for a three mile in town detour when the exit ramp to change expressways is two miles ahead  .
several other out of the way detours also plagued the trip  .
in town directions were also not direct even after changing settings indicating direct route  .
returned unit after a week  .
have rented a garmin unit in the past and is very pleased , will probably buy one when see a good sale  .
stay away from this unit .
i'm an electrical engineer and i work in software development field  .
i've evaluated numerous portable gps units and i would rate the navigon 2100 at the bottom of my list  .
the routing algorithm in the navigon 2100 is below par  .
there are 4 route settings to chose from   fast route , optimal route , short route and scenic route in my opinion , they should all be called scenic route as none of the settings will route you in the shortest path  .
the points of interest (poi) are also inaccurate  .
for example , in my town , the navigon 2100 displays a schnucks grocery store where one never existed (in the middle of a 50 year old subdivision) by comparison , i also have the tomtom navigator 6 software installed on my at t tilt cell phone  .
tomtom is by far better than the navigon as far as route optimization  .
tomtom navigator 6 does provide voice guided directions , however , it does not have the text    to    speech capabilities (so you do not get the street names announced)  .
i chose to buy the navigon 2100 for its text    to    speech capabilities , but the poor routing negates the text    to    speech feature  .
i would return the navigon 2100 but the compusa only allows for an exchange if the unit is defective bottom line , if you want optimal routing , avoid navigon .
the navigon 2100 is not a simple gps to navigate through  .
the response of the touch screen is very disappointing  .
programs are not simple at all , i compare this with my wife`s garmin nuvi 200  .
easy to operate easy to navigate easy to program  .
i thought most gps would be similar to operate  .
is i wrong  .
here is the email i received when i asked how to get a new car charger for my navigon 2100    .
thank you for your inquiry  .
accessories , map material and content are not available in north america through navigon  .
unfortunately we do not have information concerning the availability of these products at other major retail shops sincerely  .
stephen purdue  .
navigon support team  .
e    mail   support  .
us@navigon  .
com  .
do not waist your time with the scenic options , maryland has one of the oldest scenic rt40 east/west  .
i have tried all the options including the new 1  .
2 software  .
the navigon refuses to see it the product is not delivering what it says  .
i am very disappointed .
after doing some research i bought navigon2100 and when i tried to input my address it didn't find the city (mount prospect , il 60056)then i tried couple of other addresses and it could not find the addresses i called the customer service and the agent said let me try to find the address on the unit here and he could not find the addresses , he said some addresses may not be found and the solutions he gave were (in his own words)    .
try entering the address number of times and some time it might take  .
when i told him i already tried to enter the address many times with out any success he advised me to  .
use it by finding the nearest intersection  .
when i told him it could not find the entire city his suggestion was  .
use the neighboring city  .
i asked him is this the way navigation systems work , he said we can not do any thing and that's the way it is  .
when i told him that is not the solution i is looking for he said we use navtech for the gps software go to their website and update your address and they will update their maps database some time next year and you can use your system then  .
when i asked to speak to his supervisor , he came back and said supervisor has nothing to talk , thats all we can do  .
the final solution he gave me is to return the devise and buy tom tom or some thing else , i couln't believe when he said we are not the only the company selling navigation systems  .
this is the first time i have been suggested by a customer service rep to buy a competetor's product finally it is the thing that does not work and the customer service has no answer to it .
as far as the navigon itself it is fine but the additional feature of updated maps do not spend the money they do not work .
do not buy any navigion product  .
if you do you are stuck  .
it freezes all the time  .
now it wont even turn on  .
and yes the battery is charged  .
it has a mind of its own  .
the reset button works when it feels like it    which is rarely  .
it takes you the longest , craziest routes no matter what you configure (highways or fastest route etc)  .
it just doesn't matter  .
it has told me to get off main highways to take backroads with a gazillion lights , when i already know the area know to stay on the turnpike or main road  .
if i followed it , it would take several hours compared to 20 mins  .
absolutely terrible  .
customer service is the worse in the industry  .
i complained they sent me a new card only    which did nothing  .
they refused to replace my unit  .
this gps has caused me great pain grief  .
i foolishly relied on it have gotten terribly lost at the most inconvenient time  .
now you cant get a live support person on the phone  .
everything is email  .
do not buy this unit  .
you will surely regret it  .
get a garmin  .
i bought 2 of the premium ones for my kids they work great  .
no problems whatsoever  .
i feel like i just flushed my $$$ down the toilet  .
it freezes all the time , or worse it turns off  .
it recalculates at the most inappropriate time you miss your turn because it's so slow  .
it takes forever to start up  .
customer service is horrible  .
their attitude is once you buy it , it's yours  .
it doesn't matter if it does not work  .
they'll send you a new card but that's it because the rep told me there is nothing wrong with your unit  .
updated  .
on jul 16 , 2010  .
i received this item after i brought some tires and i gues it's true 'you get what you pay for' because i have never been able to get it to work  .
i sent the first one back and they sent me a new one which also didn't work i left it outside inorder to see if it would connect with a satelite but it never did  .
it keep talking about an activation key which the company support assured me that i did not need  .
they told me it would work right out of the box but it never did  .
i'm looking into what i can actually buy that will work .
i called support and they sent me a new unit and an updated version of the mapping program with no success  .
the customer service rep told me to return the unit at one point when i told him i is unhappy with it  .
look for something else  .
i received this as a christmas present on christmas day  .
less than 12 hours later , this thing had completely locked up on me and is stuck on the boot screen , if you will  .
i immediately called navigon and is told that they were aware of the problem and that a fix would be issued within 24 hours  .
ok , i can live with that forty    eight hours later i had heard nothing from them  .
i is on vacation so i called them back to let them know of my other phone number that they can use to contact me when they issue a fix  .
i asked about the status and they said the fix would be issued within the week  .
being patient i said ok a week goes by nothing  .
i call them back to check on status , they said that the fix would be issued within the next week  .
i said ok  .
i called them back the very next day and they said the fix would be issued in a couple of days (i know all this because i started recording stuff a while back    you can check my complaint on the bbb if you'd like)  .
i called them back the next day and they said the fix would be issued by the end of the quarter (which would be march)  .
this is where i lost it i asked to speak to a manager  .
the rudest manager in the world gets online  .
she issues a rma and tells me to ship it to some address in indiana , pack it , ship it , insure it , and they'll issue me a new one (one without the software fix i might add)  .
i told that i did not feel i should pay for anything to do with shipping this and her words to me were well , it's only like $20 sir  .
this is where i issued my bbb complaint with them when everything is said and done , they did issue the software fix and it did in fact fix the system  .
however , further researching told me that the mn6 file within the sd card is corrupted  .
if the technical support team would have sent a new mn6 file my unit (and others) would have been fixed  .
instead , they sat on the issue for quite a while until i'm assuming enough people complained the poi listing has much to be desired and i is told that there is no plans to issue regular updates to the unit at this time buy something else .
Accuracy, Lane Guidance, Speed limit display, Voice guidance, Route planning etc.; Windshield mount falls sometimes, we should use dashboard mount

It is awesome!; Can't find any!
Excellent for it's price; Slow find sattellite
cheap. Nice size; Never worked even after I was sent a second unit.
Graphics, Text-to-Speech, Cost, One-time Payment for Traffic; Mysterious Routing
Bargain, Reality View, Free Lifetime Traffic, Branded icons; no ac plug included, volume could be louder, but its ok
text-to-speech for $149, awesome graphics; route recalculation sluggish at times, keypad very small
Love the reality view; Screen/map freeze frequently - big problem

Nice screen. easy to read.; Not so easy to program
Easy to Use, Text to Speech; Small Screen
Text to Voice; Horrible routing algorithm
Like text to speech feature; Occasionally chose inefficient routes
LifetimeTraffic,Text to Speech,Reality View!!; Processer slow,touch screen small icons,map of lower 48 only
A big bang for the buck!; Not a single con worth mentioning!
Features - TTS, Speed Limit Warnings, Flexibility. Price; Map needs to be Updated
Great sensitivity to sats. Accurate maps. Good TTS.; When I find one I'll let you know.
No need to have the mount on the windshield; Can be pricey
Great screen, volume is good, Reality view is awesome, prive is great for text-to-speech; To add traffic, cost is a little pricey
Good Looking, AutoZoom, Text to Speech, Price; Slow satellite pickup, slow interface
good product for the price; response time a little slow
Text to Speech, Compact &#38; Battery option; Takes too long to recognize typing, keypad is too small
Ease of use; text to speech; Route recalculation is odd
Low price, quick rerouting, text to speech; Poor traffic reception, sometime poor routing. outdated and insufficient poi's
Spoken Street Names, Out of the box ready to go; Delay, slow signal pickup
Low price, Intuitive user interface, clean graphics, reality view, clear screen/text, and the optional lifetime traffic updates are amazing; small screen, mounting bracket a bit clunky, POI's a bit outdated
3D maps with correct lane signs to be in complex intersections, Speed limit signs; A little sluggish but doesnt inhibit performance, less POI's compared to Garmin
Great value and better than $200+ unit; The interface is little different but you will learn it within a day
Text-to-voice ,nice display,all for under 200 dollars; One needs to play with it to get to know a few quirky points
FREE traffic info, simple to use, no unnecessary features; Icons are a little small, sometime slow response
I couldn't use it to find any pros; Did Not find the address and the worst customer service
none compared to the garmin nuvi 200; functions are to complex to move around and the response is very aggravating !!!
Accurate directions text to speech volume sounds fair; no menu icons turns on slow pay for updates
The size of the unit is nice.; Since I purchased the 2100 about 4 months ago I have routinely found that it miscalculates routes, does not get satellite reception and freezes when re-calculating. The voice mis-pronounces the street names more often than not.
text to speach, size, price, muli route function; menu is a little less intuitive, fewer options than more expensive garmins
equipped with reality view and software update available. text to speech equiped indicating the real street name in each turn; slightly sluggish in responding to character entry
Pretty good device, reality view is excellent, text to speech is marvelous, pretty accurate; interface would require some time to learn, no detailed manual so less gizmo savvy people would require some time to learn it
Spectacular graphics; excellent text to voice features; spoken street names a BIG plus!; Buttons on display are a little small, but overall this is a great unit!
Reality View, screen displays next two turns, early warning for turns and lane changes, option to purchase life time traffic rather than subscription; Small screan, volume is not all that loud
Nice screen &#38; graphics, but HA what good is that if it can't direct you or freezes &#38; can't be reset when you're lost in the middle of nowhere &#38; need it the most?!; Freezes all the time. Reset button rarely works. Takes you the longest, most inconvenient route no matter what you configure. EXTREMELY slow! Unreliable. It might get you there, but trust me YOU WILL BE LATE!
nice size screen, free software update, option to add traffic service later, $79 is cheep-cheep! Doesn't seem sluggish to me - takes a sec to calculate a route I guess - doesn't bother me at all.; I guess free traffic service would be nice, but hey these things cost money...
- Text to speech...actually speaks street names and state roads. - Plenty of warning before turn (tells you street to turn on, not just "next L/R"). - Decent screen. - Lifetime traffic update cost less than any other service; - Text to speech makes some street names sound funny. - Battery life seems too short (about 3 hours)
Text to speech and reality view nice screen and good sound; none the gps was great only for 119.00 ya dig
The product works okay but the support is absolutely horrible. See the email below from an actual support rep at Navigon when I asked where to buy a replacement car charger.; Horrible, arrogant support. Basically told me that they do not support anything in North America. See the actual email in the bottom line summary...unbelievable.
has a nice maps of the expressway when available; system runs to slow as a visual, the system tends to freeze up. the icons are in the way of the map and very limited POI
I like everything about it except for the cons mentioned below.; It sometimes takes several minutes to pick up a signal. If the road you are on turns at an intersection yet keeps the same name, it will not give a voice prompt to turn. Once, the road I was on disappeared from the map.
You get updated maps quarterly; You pay $80 for this but you cannot downlaad the maps I requested support and got an answer 3 months later. They tell you the same thing over and over but never give you a solution. They keep telling you to make sure Fresh Maps software is updated
I like the reality mode, the street names, and compact size.; Took me out of the way several times, told me to enter a street with a Do Not Enter sign on 3 occasions. POI suck. They didn't interest me. Don't buy it if you like shooting pool.
Automatically sets to a state (Mass.) so you don't have to keep telling it.. Predictive streets: Suggestions as you type::Ad=Adams,Admore,Adwater. Recalculate is fast. If you miss the street, by the time you look down, "NELLIE" has caught up. AYE!; NO GPS gives direct CROW FLIES directions or knows which route is really the shortest (drive THROUGH the park James!) but this is pretty good for narrowing you down. Know the basic direction and use this when youre few miles away.. LEARN YOUR AREAS.
Gives names of streets and hi ways. Nice visuals. Makes a nice paper weight.; I have had the 2100 for a few months. Gave me directions to go 52 miles for a 29 mile trip. Had me going East 9 miles out of my way when my desitnation was to the West. It still wants me to go East on trips when I know that West is correct.
It does what it says on the box ! - Great price. nice good looking design. Big on usful features and easy to use if you read the instructions !!!!; TTS is a little hit and miss with road names and the inflextion is sometimes off but not really a con as they all do it!.
3D view &#38; good support on the product. I've used this GPS in my travels, it gave me traffic updates, several that routed me around traffic snarls with accurate directions.Various settings with a lot of information. Voice directions loud and clear.; Small key pad for big fingers. The interface has been sluggish on start ups. I've had to push the reset button, sometimes, when downloading new maps.
