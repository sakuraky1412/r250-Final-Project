Pros:. 1. Picture quality. 2. Opt ZOOM. 3. DIGIC4. 4. Battery Backup. 5. Flash &#38; ISO. 
Cons:. 4 battery set so a bit heavy.. handle with care.. 
Summary:. you will love it. njoy dis thng.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent image quality. High zoom with great IS. Great video mode. Stereo audio recording. Tilt-N'-Swivel screen. The body's almost as big as an entry-level DSLR camera at 128 x 88 x 87mm. Rest assured, this is not one of those cute pocket superzooms..... 
Cons:. Mostly I use this camera with Manual mode; I somehow have a feeling that most of the automatic modes does not bring out the best of this camera.... 
Summary:. I bought "Canon SX10 IS" by Jan '09 after checking 40-50 odd reviews over Internet and happy to write one in the end after using it for around 8 months!!. Am pretty happy with the outcome of this product.... It is for guys who aspire for DSLR camera's but cud not afford around 40K. This comes in with loads and loads of features. You get a feeling that you are professional photographer. If you are serious about photography. This is the one to go for.. The SX10 IS makes it clear that you're serious about your photography.. Now it is available in Indian market for around 26K. Do give it a go..... Mark my words, itz worth every penny that you spend!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Camera!. 
Cons:. Hey! Read The Book!!!! Go Out and Try Different settings!. 
Summary:. For all you complainers.....If you thisk this camera is heavy,go lift a dslr with a opt 300mm lens then come back and tell us how heavy this camera is! Then ask them the price! Now,You low light complainers,maybe if you read your manual,instead of taking the camera out of the box,putting it on auto,and go,you would benefit if you tried a different setting like program,and set your output of your flash and your shutter speed! I think you would like this camera a little better! And remember...You paid a lot less for this point and shoot than you did for a DSLR with a lens!. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredible photos! The automatic mode produces incredible skin tones and perfect contrast. Perfect for novice users.. 
Cons:. None, really. Some reviews have said there is no place to put the lens cap. Flip it over, there's a clip to attach the cap to the camera strap.. 
Summary:. Excellent camera that produces incredible images. Mega zoom rocks! I've taken photos from 50+ yards away and they came out perfect. I am most impressed with the color, clarity, and contrast of the images produced by this camera. Skin tones, lights, darks, shadows, etc. are really awesome. I will never go back to a point and shoot pocket camera. There's just no comparison, especially for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing Zoom, great features, ease of use, great battery life,. 
Cons:. not so great pictures at higher (+400) ISO. no raw format (if you really think you need it). 
Summary:. I did alot of research before buying this camera. I am NOT dissapointed, it does everything I want it to do. I was almost thinking about a DSLR, but didn't want to invest in the lenses, or take on the hassle of not having a point and shoot. I haven't found a situation where I have been unhappy with this camera yet.. The auto mode does almost everything flawlessly, and the manual mode give all the control you need. By far the best camera i have owned. 

$$;
Pros:. The zoom is fabulous--up to 80 digital and 20 Optical. Not cumbersome when extended and after 6 months, I finally learned where to put my fat fingers to avoid pressing the many controls while shooting. I travel a LOT, so having so many features is #1. 
Cons:. The controls are very close together and it takes some time to learn how to hold the cam. The manual is less than good, and lots is learned by trial &#38; error. I velcro the lenscap to the bottom with a small string attaching both. It works fine.. 
Summary:. The pictures are amazingly sharp. I can edit a photo down to a small face in the background &#38; it is still sharp. Once you learn your way around the cam, it is easy, quick, and allows lots of creativity in your photography. I put a screen protector on the viewing window and it was a great idea. My old Cannon was all scratched because I always forgot to close the back of the camera. Now I just change the plastic protector. Battery life is good, and one spare set of rechargeables will keep you going all day. Recovery time is fine, and the 'Sports' mode makes continuous shooting easy. I am VERY happy with the camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. ROTATING LCD TO GET DOWN TO THE GRAND KIDS LEVAL WHILE STILL STANDING. THE FACE SELF TIMER, IT PICKS UP YOUR FACE WHEN TAKING A GROUP PICTURE AND THAT STARTS THE TIMER. SHARP IMAGES WHEN KEEPING ISOs AROUND 200, TRY NOT TO USE AUTO ISO SHIFT MODE.. 
Cons:. COMPARED TO THE (SX 110), (SD 880) - YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET USE TO A LENS CAP ,A NECK STRAP AND A LITTLE MORE WEIGHT, BUT IT WILL BE WORTH IT.. 
Summary:. SX 10 COMPARED TO (SX 110) AND THE (SD 880) (ALL3 CAMERAS- (TRY TO SHOOT IN GOOD LIGHT AND KEEP ISOs LOW AS POSSIBLE. 880, SX110 HAVE NICE BRIGHT 3inLCDs, SX10 A NICE BRIGHT 2.5 in LCD THAT ROTATES, TURN IT IN FACEING THE CAMERA TO POTECT THE LCD OR TO TAKE A SELF PORTED. THE SX110 WAS BRIGHTER BUT THE SX 10 HANDLED THE SUN A LITTLE BETTER..THEIR SPEED-880 BEING THE FASTEST BUT THE SX 10 WAS RIGHT THEIR WITH IT, THE SX110 WAS ALLMOST TWICE AS SLOW (WITH FLASH ON) BUT TO BE FAIR IT USES ONLY 2 AA BATTERYS.. BOTH THE SX10&#38; SX110 YOU HAVE TO USE 2500-2900mAH RECHARGEABLES OR ENERGIZER LITHIUM BATTERYS, I THINK USING STANDERD AAs YOUR JUST NOT GOING TO BE AS HAPPY ..ALL 3 CAMERAS HAVE THE SCROLL WHEELS, THE 880s IS THE BEST, SX110s IS NEXT BEST AND SX10 COMES IN THIRD .. &lt; JUST SAYING...) SD CARDs ARE NEXT- I USE SANDISK EXTREME III (2 OR 4 gigs),EXTREME II WOULD ALSO DO A GOOD JOB.. I LIKE THE WIDE 28MM LENS ON BOTH THE 880 AND THE SX 10. ALL 3 CAMERAS HAVE GREAT AUTO RED EYE FIX BUT I THINK IT DOES SLOW THE CAMERS DOWN A BET.. IF YOUR NEW TO THIS CAMERA STUFF REMEMBER TO FORMAT YOUR SD MEMORY CARD 1st THING..... 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic, crisp image quality; articulating lcd; loads of features; largest zoom in its class; stereo sound and good video quality. Too many features to list here. 
Cons:. Must read the manual through a few times to really unlock the capabilities and range of this camera. Could have used a burst function or faster shooting mode(only get 1.4fps at high end). 
Summary:. This camera, along with the Lumix fz28 are at the top of the superzoom pile (the sx1 is costing ALOT more). I have owned this unit for a couple of months now, and after a few hundred pics, I couldn't be happier with the results. If you are new to canon products, I would urge you to read the manual a few times, as I did, in order to truly appreciate what this camera can do. You wont be disapointed. JoeB. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the zoom lens, 20x is awesome! I have used Canon Powershots for some time and I love the fact that I have stepped up to a powerful little camera - the SX10!. 
Cons:. My only gripe is that I wish I could date/time stamp my photos like I am used to in the little Powershots! Plus I am not an Apple fan and the movies are recorded in Quicktime versions (.mov) But I download iTunes and the movies do look very good!. 
Summary:. This camera is a an excellent camera for anyone even half way serious about taking photos! Obviously it is not a pocket camera but it rocks! I took some photos of people surfing and I was not even close at all and the photos are amazing!!! Really.. 

$$;
Pros:. I wanted a long zoom for vacation and travel and this is just what I needed. I owned a S-2 and really liked that camera from Canon. I thought I would have to put up big bucks to have a camera like this but was pleased to pay under 400.00. 
Cons:. The only thing I don't like is that I can't use the filters I have from my S-2. Because Canon made the lens for not to be used with special filters. I guess they expect you to use a photo shop program to get those results.. 

$$;
Pros:. 20x zoom is phenomenal. Simple to use. Reasonable price. Unless you're a professional photographer, it's hard to distinguish pictures taken with the SX10 IS and the more expensive dSLRs. (At least I couldn't tell and I 've had them both!). 
Cons:. The camera is a little heavy, but the 20X Zoom is worth the extra weight.. 
Summary:. This camera is my favorite so far. I started out years ago with the earlier Canon A-line pocket camera and advanced to the Canon S2, S3 and S5 cameras. While there wasn't much difference between the S2, S3 and S5 in terms of features and ergonomics, the SX10 IS is a great improvement over all. For starters, Canon finally fixed the issue with the camera lens. While it's not perfect, it stays on at least and doesn't pop off constantly like it did on the previous S series. Also, the buttons have been moved to more convenient places around the camera. Of course, the biggest improvement in my eyes is the 20X zoom! While the 12 megapixels are impressive, ( I rarely blow picture up larger than 8x10 anyway), it's the 20X Zoom that makes this camera second to none!! Even at full zoom, the pictures are clear and the colors are accurate. (Albeit, when zooming to 20X, the object can and does appear blurry on the LCD screen, but when downloaded and printed out...this is not the case.) I love the color accent and face detection modes, and the fact that you can zoom in while taking a video. I honestly have no use for my camcorder anymore as the SX10's video mode is THAT good! Battery Life is awesome. Just make sure you have two sets of re-chargable batteries if you use the LCD and the video feature(which you will....often!). I recently bought the newest Canon XSI dSLR and had it for a couple of weeks before selling it on E-bay. I missed my "LCD viewfinder", zoom lens, and video option THAT MUCH!! When I found out that Canon had upgraded the S5 to the SX10, I was thrilled! I bought it as soon as it was released at a reasonable price online and I have not been dissappointed! I have taken many Fall foliage photos and many people have told me they look "professional". As an amateur hobbyist, I mostly use the Auto setting for outdoor photos, and the Program setting for low light situations, but a more advanced photographer would appreciate all the other manual settings, that make Canon the best in the business. I highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking to expand their horizens, but is not yet confident enough in their abiliy to delve into the world of DSLRs.. Updated. on Nov 3, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. High Quality Pix, Great from 28 mm to 560 mm. Movie Compression and Quality Superb.. 
Cons:. None, unless one is trying to get a much more costly camera with different lenses.. 
Summary:. By far the best Megazoom Out there. I own the Powershot 2S IS and one of the 10 optical zoom Panasonics and have used most of the others. This one is by far the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. A wonderful camera with good speed, a great lens and everything you need in one package so you don't need to carry a lot of equipment. The lens has great range and very good optics. Detail is superb. From Macro to 586mm, you are always ready to go.. 
Cons:. Hard to find anything wrong with this one. Perhaps a bit more reach for very low light situations would be nice, but in general this one does more than any other out there.. 
Summary:. This one does it all in one package. After years of shooting with an SLR, I made the leap to a this camera and love it, love it, LOVE IT!. Lens: Great lens with broad reach, good clarity and fine detail allows for hand held shooting in most situations with excellent results. Macro is very sharp and 586mm covers the range of what most photographers would ever need.. Body: Good feel. Balanced. Nice size. Feels like an SLR without the need for a carrying case for the extras needed with an SLR.. 10 mega pixels gives great detail in final product.. Can shoot fully automatic or set anything that you like so that you can get the results you expect from an SLR.. 

$$;
Pros:. it takes beautiful pictures at any distance. 
Cons:. i can't figure out the time stamp. 
Summary:. ok my mom's boyfriend had just gotten one and we can not seem to figure out how to remove the time stamp on his camera so if anyone could help that would be much appreciated!!!! just for another bit of information its a Canon Powershot SX20 IS. 

$$;
Pros:. Good photo quality. good lens. flexible screen. solid construction. 
Cons:. no HD. large. battery hog. heavy. 
Summary:. Its a good camera but a bit too large for beginners. 

$$;
Pros:. Has an optical viewfinder,the option of using manual automatic settings, a good zoom, rapid shooting feature, built-in hot shoe for external flash, easy to handle. Great camera to learn manual photography on before advancing to a DSLR. Great price.. 
Cons:. The lens cap is not tethered to the camera (what were you thinking, Canon?) which is a huge inconvenience.. 
Summary:. I would recommend this camera to anyone who loves photography as a hobby and wants something more professonal, but still allows the photographer the choice of point and shoot or manual without having to lug around two cameras.. 

$$;
Pros:. Exellent zoom, features, excellent hd video.. 
Cons:. Date stamping absens is not really a cons, I would use it occasionally when taking family or a party photos. this is well solved with EXIF. Cons is that manufacturer does not inform users how to apply date/time later.. 
Summary:. Updated. on Nov 8, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Same Processor as more expensive slr lens equivalence as 2-3 lens for a starter SLR. 
Cons:. Lens cap should have a tether. 
Summary:. Great camera for a avid shooter who doesn't want the budget of a pro, its not the slr but all the lenses. Camera is compatible with SLR flash packs and basically acts as an SLR w/o raw mode and the back that the 28-520 lens doesnt screw off.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp Images (even at full optical zoom), Easy-to-control variable speed zoom, quick startup, great flash, tons of menu settings, and the list goes on. 
Cons:. Continous shoot mode could be a little faster, not much warning when batteries are about to die. 
Summary:. I did a lot of research on cameras, and this one really stood out to me. When it arrived, it took a little getting used to, but it did not disappoint me and will not disappoint you unless you are looking for the performance of a $1500 setup out of it. Even then, I would be willing, after having practiced with it, to take on many of the DSLR's I have seen. This is definitely a camera with which you get "bang for your buck." Don't be scared by claims that the grip is bad, the zoom is slow, the lens cap doesn't have a strap, etc... The camera is worth every penny.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality is excellent... and noise is tolerable even at ISO 800... 20x zoom is simply amazing... 
Cons:. One thing that I really don't like is the continuous mode..... Raw would gave been nice!... 

$$;
Pros:. Optical zoom is fast, face detection appears accurate, allows still pictures to be taken while recording video, IS really works. 
Cons:. Pictures appear noisy at 1600 ISO, but I guess that is to be expected....that would be about it if I had to say something neg about this camera.. 
Summary:. I was looking for a video camera as my son has become mobile and, although I love my DSLR (Nikon D300), I wanted a second/replacement camera. I found the Canon and loved it when I tried it at the store. I decided to buy one and haven't been disappointed. The video mode is excellent (not HD quality, but I knew this) and the optical zoom is great. Although the camera is a little bulky, and not really a replacement for my DSLR camera in body size, I really like how funtional it is. If all I'm doing is still pictures, I take the D300, but if on a family outing....I take both, but usually end up using the Canon exclusively. I haven't found a negative on this camera yet....well, I would say AUTO mode seems to shoot in ISO of 80...which I don't like. It probably is user error and I am too lazy to read the manual. However, I just put it in Program mode and use 400 ISO. Anyways, if you can't tell by now...I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Seems like a great camera, lens is very nice. I tested it on the SF Bay Area and the clarity was awsome, zoom is like a spy glass, way better then I could see. Features seem full, have not tried sky time exposures yet but will.. 
Cons:. Non yet, maybe the strap could be a little heftier.. 
Summary:. Seems solid, like the ease of use and looking forward to getting into the features. Lens is fantastic, and the processor is fast, LCD is crisp and visable in the day light. Good choice, I'm happy, and it was fairly cheap.. 

$$;
Pros:. The flip-and-twist LCD, Unbelievable Zoom capabilities, "good feel", large number of shooting possibilities, easy to use control buttons. Video excellent quality, and easy to activate. All menus are easy to understand and use.. 
Cons:. Instruction manual poorly illustrated and written. Clip on lens cap will get lost if clipped to the strap without a tether. What a dumb idea. These are the only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars.. 
Summary:. I am a retired professional artist and have used every media available. I now specialize in pencil art and Photoshop. I have migrated to photography as a spin-off of Photoshop. I discovered combinations of photography and free hand art was a unique way to express my art. I thrive on mental challenges, as a way of remaining "young", so I joined "The Villages Photography Club".. When I saw some of the photos taken by members I realized my little Nikon Coolpix pocket camera would not be suitable, so I went to the store to purchase a large Nikon camera. Expense was not a factor and I expected to spend about $1,000. In fact I thought an SLR would be mandatory to get the kind of quality I was looking for. The salesman told me that for the price I could not get much better quality,than the PowerShot.. The flip-and-twist LCD immediately sold me on the Canon PowerShot SX10 IS. I compared features of every camera not concerned about price and this camera easily won me over. When I discovered it was only $360 I was pleasantly surprised. Now I am an enthusiastic Canon user.. After I temporarily lost my lens cover, because it fell off my strap, I fashioned a lens cover tether by drilling a hole through the cap, attaching a "jewelry-clip on chain, using a cable tie which I fashioned from materials bought at Jo-An Fabrics. A clumsy solution. Canon engineers should have provided a better arrangement. If there was a lens cap made by Canon with a well designed snap-on tether I would buy it.. I have spent many hours the last month learning my camera using the manual, and going to various web sites and buying books. I find that every expression of photography is handled by my PowerShot, and am determined to learn all facets of this fine piece of equipment. Of course I am retired, have two college degrees and have the time to spend pouring over the terrible manual. I wonder how the young first time camera owner can learn how to correctly use this fine camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge 20X (28-560mm) Optical Zoom Lens, 10.0 MP (9,980,928 pixels), Accelerometer, Quick Record Button, Custom White Balance, Flip-and-Twist LCD, Face-Detection, comfortable weight, SDHC slot separate from battery compartment. 
Cons:. AA Batteries, poor Auto-Focus on close range, poor Auto White Balance - results in yellowing in videos and photos. 
Summary:. All in all a good buy, but it pays to get lithium AAs. Don't zoom in on close shots - go point blank if you must. If you don't want to set the White Balance, go for "Tungsten" for indoor shots. Don't leave the exposure for too long, because the photo will be reddened. However, I don't regret my buy, and I would recommend this to anyone that is at least at the "hobbyist" level. I would give this a 5/5, but I haven't used it much yet, so it's a 4.5/5.. P.S. Can the guys at CNET make a video of the SX10 IS? CNET Australia and CNET UK already have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great pictures. True vivid colors. Easy to use menu. Solid construction. Feels like a much more expensive camera.. 
Cons:. Sometimes autofocus has difficulty focusing under dim lighting. Other than this, Ican not find anything else wrong or that I dislike about the Canon Powershot SX10IS. 
Summary:. I would highly recommend this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Many exposure settings, fast auto focus, wide variable lens, comfortable to hold, EVF adjustable, swivel LCD screen, 1 fps continious drive, hot shoe, excellent image stabilizer.. 
Cons:. Narrow aperature settings, (F 8.0 yields limited depth of field), Canon says there are no filter threads for user use, lens cap easy to lose, user manual difficult to understand, confusing icons, .MOV video files (more difficult for Windows users).. 
Summary:. After seeing this camera on display in an electronics store, I knew it was a must have camera, and simply paid retail for mine. I'm more used to the old 35mm film cameras where I could get more creative, but still recommend this camera. I had compared several cameras in store prior to finding this one, and rejected all of them mostly because of the fact that they had blurred view finder images, poor auto focus etc. But this Canon doesn't have any of these troubles. I've shot nearly 1,000 shots with it and it contines to impress me every time. For 99% of us who want something more sophisticated, this is the camera to get! I really enjoy this camera!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic image quality during daylight. Great zoom. 20X with very good picture resolution. Lots of quick image settings.. Swivel LCD. Good image stabilizer.. Burst mode (About 1 fps... AWESOME). 
Cons:. Red eyes at night are still an issue.. Lens cap is a clip on that will get lost if you're not carefull. No HD movie capability. Flash range is not as good as comparable model cameras. 
Summary:. ALRIGHT.... Just a quick review on my gear... Aside from the sx10 is, I also have a Rebel XSI and a Canon 7D.. It is very important to point out that THIS IS NOT A DSLR and as much as people want it to be, it will NEVER COMPARE.... Raving said that... This is deffinitely the best bang for the buck in it's own category. Some pics even do look close to some entry level DSLRs.. Even with Nikon having a longer zoom (24x), the image quality in this camera is fantastic for a point and shoot. Even with the zoom at it's maximum range, you can still get awesome images assuming that you have enough light o increase the shutter speed to use it freely or a tripod if you need to use some apperture.. Images have no shadowing whatsoever... very detailed, very good... especially at low ISO.. At night time I wished for 1 little thing... 1 - That the flash has a longer range. Unfortunatelly, after around 12 to 15 ft you won't be capturing much at nigh, unless you have time to adjust settings to better capture the natural lighting.... The burst mode is something that I really enjoy... One pic after another and the image is still great.. Manual flash is awesome... if you have some light and a little knowledge of how to set the camera for night time, you can take lots of pics without dragging attention to yourself. To use the flash, you just need to touch it up.. Although there's no HD, the video quality is still AWESOME... And I do mean VERY VERY GOOD. Good sound and claer images AND... YOU CAN USE THE ZOOM WHILE SHOOTING THE VIDEO.... I LOVE THIS CAMERA AND IF YOU TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO LEARN I'S FEATURES I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO.. Your weekend at Disney or at the Beach will be recorded at it's best with this baby.. 

$$;
Pros:. Thru the lens view finder with a diopter is very useful in wide angle. The menus are intuitive and simple to operate. Disposable lithium ion batteries have and incredible long life. I carry four extra batteries so I will ALWAYS have power.. 
Cons:. 20x zoom seems excessive and requires a tripod. Switching between the viewfinder and the screen is cumbersome. Have to be careful when holding the camera as buttons, sensors and microphones may be blocked or pressed.. 
Summary:. I like the camera because of its feel and weight. After a little practice and reading I found I could take "photographs" instead of "pictures". The cameras manual settings although not as numerous as those found on DSLR's there are enough that an amateur can use with relative ease. The camera and all it is capable of doing seem a bit overwhelming at first I found that reading the manual and "playing around" with it is pretty simple. The thru the lens view finder has a diopter and is great for wide angle shots and 3x or 5x zoom. The disposable lithium batteries I use last an incredibly long time. I carry four extra batteries in my case at all time so I will never find myself without power. The video feature is pretty sad. Want decent video? Buy a Canon digital camera and a Canon or Panasonic video camera. Indoor shooting with or without flash is inconsistent. Adjusting megapixels, AWB and shutter speed can help. The best thing to do is buy a decent flash as the camera has shoe mount. I have owned this camera for one year and use it almost everyday. With all the mostly useful features and manual settings some patience I am for the first time that I can take "photographs" that i frame and hang in our home. The camera is bulky and not the easiest camera to carry around but it is a small inconvenience compared to the photographs I create.. 

$$;
Pros:. Effective IS, great color, quiet zoom during video, comfortable to hold, Sports mode is back, surprisingly long battery life, takes rechargeable AAs, no serious issues that can't be fixed with CHDK or 3rd-party accessories.. 
Cons:. Imperfect controls, no threading for filters, fringing, difficult low light focusing, mediocre flash recycling, flawed exposure bracketing in some conditions, bulky. Had to put a small hole in the release of the lens cap to tether it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Being an over the road truck driver, this is the perfect camera. And a nature lover like myself, I like going from closeup of the bee on a flower to catching prong horns on the run without any added equipment.. 
Cons:. Just like the S2, which I had also, there is no easy way to maually focus, although this one is better. Also, getting that super sharp picture is not as easy when the the subject is far away.. Plan on buying a lens cap that has a strap.. 
Summary:. Everyday and all across the country, I am looking for the perfect shot. This camera has allowed me to get some really great shots without having to spend twice the money or more for equipment that I could not fit in my truck. Just add tri-pod and lets go shooting.. 

$$;
Pros:. Controls are intuitive, lens is fast enough and zoom is way sufficient without having to use digital zoom. Hot shoe is a nice addition to previous S series cameras. Once you get used to the flip screen LCD it's hard to live without it.. 
Cons:. No RAW file support. Very poor users manual. This should have a 3" LCD but I guess they were trying to keep size under control. What is up with the inability to screw a standard 52mm polarizer filter into the lens !!! Geezzzz Canon, what a mistake. 
Summary:. I bought this at DeltaCamera.com for 267.00 and due to the savings added a 270EX Speedlite which is a perfect fit for this camera. This camera is way easier to use than the S2IS that it replaces although I am a bit concerned about the E18 kiss of death. I got 5 good years out of the S2IS though. None of these cameras are built like many of the old venerable 35mm film machines but what is these days? If I get 5 years out of this and as manyy pictures I'll be happy.. Button placement is good and in my opinion the menu is far easier to navigate than my S2IS was. Lensmate has a filter solution for this camera but why should we have to go to an outside company for something that should be such a no brainer ?. If you get one don't bother downloading the software....its just redundannt to the software that comes packaged in almost all computers these days.. For someone wanting more than a point and shoot and who likes a bulkier camera with a great option set and doesnt want to commit to a true DSLR's price this will make your picture taking soul happy.. Updated. on Jul 20, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. After owning an S2IS I had to get this one.. 
Cons:. steady shot bursts? not really, takes one picture at a time, very slowly. So for sports you might as well forget it... unless you're shooting a chess tournament. Night shots are just that, one big black blur.. 
Summary:. If you dont do night shots or sport shots, this is perfect.The 20x zoom is amazing, the 10mgpx res compliments it perfectly, the small form factor and the lightweight make it perfect. Great results, great video and sound as well. All using popular sdhc and AA. (take that, sony). 

$$;
Pros:. I used it like binoculars to see if a spot a mile off was a rock or wildlife. The photos were amazing even while traveling in a car, bus, or train and using automatic.. Check out my photos on Facebook of my trip to Alaska.. 
Cons:. Lens cap flew off my shoulder strap when leaning out the train observation deck. Got a new one with a string that would allow it to hang from camera when in use.. It also did odd things occassionally that caused me to reset it.. 
Summary:. It is a small camera slightly larger than my compact, and less than two pounds,which made it great for sticking in my bag. The cost was medium priced so it won't kill me if I have to upgrade again in a couple years. Right now it has everything I would want so hopefully will keep it for a long time. The zoom was perfect for the wildlife pictures and scenery. With studying the booklet, I hope to get even better and be more willing to get off the automatic button.. 

$$;
Pros:. 20x zoom is unlike anything I have seen/used. The video quality is more than adequate, and I like the controls.. 
Cons:. Sometimes there is a lag between photos, and the lighting does take time to set. I would have preferred a lithium ion battery rather than the 4 AA batteries. It is a bit heavy for a non-dSLR camera. 
Summary:. The camera is a wonderful piece of equipment, because it delivers almost studio quality work without having to think about it. The price is magnificent. I bought mine at Best Buy in March 2009 in Palo Alto, CA, and paid under $400 (tax included). I have already taken over 2000 photos with it (my iphoto library can attest to that!) and it works flawlessly with all the programmes I normally use (iphoto, picasa, wonderful to work with). I am a hobbyist, not a professional by ANY standard, but I am now learning the technical side of photography.. This camera allows me to explore that without breaking the bank. There is a fully manual option, a total swing of the pendulum from the auto feature that is most promoted. I use it for taking photos at church and what have you, and was able to even use it to help the police recently in submitting to them a photo I took of a girl who subsequently went missing.. I highly recommend this to anyone with a desire to rise above the generic point &#38; shoot category, but might not have the budget to become immersed in the world of photography. I even sent a few of my photos to a buddy of mine who is a professional photographer, and he is a devoted Nikon fanboy. Even he was suitably impressed with the quality of the shots, though his discerning eye could detect some blurring where dSLR would not have had. Fine, but that is apples to oranges. It is not a dSLR, and probably shouldn't be compared to one, but the mere fact that it is speaks volumes to the quality of the unit.. Go to Best Buy or some other store where they have the unit on the shelf, and see if you can get to use it. I highly recommend purchasing some Nickel Metal Hydride rechargeable AA batteries. I personally prefer lithium ion batteries, because of their form factor and the fact that they can be recharged separately from the camera or device, but then again, so can rechargeable AA batteries. I just have a personal preference, and the fact that I new this prior to buying the camera clearly indicates that for me this was not a deal-breaker.. Try it, buy it, enjoy it, love it. It will do you well, you will not regret the purchase, and your photos will be living testimony to fact that it is a beautiful piece of equipment. Relatively inexpensive, beautiful form factor, evenly balanced, attractive design, I highly recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Features. - Lot's of shooting modes in SCN. - Simple auto mode. - Takes AA batteries. - Feels solid. 
Cons:. - Grip is too smooth, needs sticky grip. - Kind of bulky, but worth it for performance. - Need to read the manual to really figure everything out, but eventually it comes together. 
Summary:. Originally I purchased the Fuji Film S2000HD and was not happy with it's performance (good price though). So I returned it and now have the SX10. This camera has been a blast cycling though all the features. It took some time in the owners manual but there is a ton of things you can do (such as colour switch, colour accent, etc.). The AF it great and I have been able to snap some pretty decent indoor shots without a flash. There is endless shooting modes available and gives me (the novice photographer) the option to shoot auto are make an attempt at changing some of the settings.. I am off to Vietnam so now I will give it the toughness test too!. Great choice of camera!. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the zoom length, and features on this camera. Photo qualities are great too.. 
Cons:. The lens cover should be tethered to the body. Its a little heavy for everyday use.. 
Summary:. I love this camera and have used it daily since I got it 2 months ago.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Solid build. - images, range, sensitivity, reaction speed. - lots of settings. - 20X optical zoom. - good video, "zoomable", &#38; w/stereo sound. - vid time limit = mem card size. - IS. - Face Detect. - large twist LCD. - evf. - flash range. - hotshoe. - AA batts. 
Cons:. NO DATE STAMP. control ergonomics. backpanel dial (either too sensitive, or not enough). unintuitive buttons. handgrip. lens cap. batt door. No starter mem card. Flash not totally auto. User's Manual. hard to use lens hood/cap @ same time. zoom focus slow. 
Summary:. We upgraded from a Canon A95 that we loved and used often (and that was repaired fro FREE under extended/COURTESY warranty by Canon for a failed DiGiC II chip). SX10IS blows that ol' workhorse away in terms of image quality, ability to capture an usable image, versatility, and tech/feature improvements (IS, face detection, larger twist LCD, 20x optical zoom, better/longer video). The A95 is more "portable/almost-pocketable" and we'll keep it as our backup. The SX10IS will now become our workhorse, albeit a bit bulkier/heavier...can't get away with an unobtrusive "smallish" camera pouch any more and have to use a medium-sized bag now.. Canon...PLEASE redesign the idiotic lens cap (I bought an aftermarket lens tether)...and the handgrip (I bought an aftermarket handgrip loop)...and the button/control ergonomics...and the User's Manual. I had to ask a local Ritz Camera shop for help in figuring out the size for the filterlens adapter ring.....52mm. Canon... although the lens hood accessory is a nice gesture, I think a starter memory card would have been a nicer gimme and much more useful. I bought some 4GB SDHC cards and a SDHC reader device from Costco.. Canon... KEEP using the twist LCD design!! It is one of the primary features I look for in mid-size digi-cams. Prior to our circa 2004 A95, we had a circa 2000 Sony DSC-S50 that also has a twist LCD. Sony stopped using that design and along with their idiotic/proprietary/$$$$$ memory card format, we stopped shopping Sony digi-cams.. Canon (and others)...PLEASE STOP with the idiotic megapixel wars....especially for consumer-level cams. It is getting to be overkill and the larger the megapixel sizes the LARGER the file sizes. It is becoming unmanageable. Yes, I know I can use lower quality settings to reduce the file size (or use compression software), but that's like driving a Ferrari in rush hour traffic....why bother??. This is "almost" the perfect ultrazoom digital camera. I hope the SX20 or whatever the successor is called next year improves the usability factors....and maybe I'd upgrade again if there are significant improvements.. YMMV.. Updated. on Jan 5, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. I like all Canon products.. Since 1981 when I bought my first 'SLR.. 
Cons:. CNET's review. 
Summary:. CNET's review need refining and more professional assessments.. 

$$;
Pros:. Superzoom. Image stabilization. Feels solid.. 
Cons:. Poor low light performance. EVF poor resolution.. 
Summary:. Disappointing low light performance with same poor low light result as my other Canons A540 and SD700. Thought new Digic4 chip would do better (other Canons are Digic3).. Superzoom is super-duper. IS is very effective. Flash cycle time a little better than 540/700 but still feel slow (I guess due to AA battery format.). Overall, a good Canon. But I still take the A540 to the park with the kids due to the smaller size and relatively similar picture quality. I would take the SX10 to sports events, graduations, or recitals, where you can take full advantage of the superzoom/IS when you're sitting in the bleachers.. If you don't need the superzoom, I would buy the A590 or SD850 instead. These Canons, overall price per performance-wise, would be a better deal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice feel to hands. Like the swivel screen. Very good zoom lens. Works perfectly with Eye-fi card.. 
Cons:. Every now and then the camera freezes reports a "Lens error restart camera." This clears up when thumping camera bottom on hand. Not a big problem so far. But it is worrysome.. 
Summary:. I've had many Canon compact cameras, and this one is the best so far, the lens error notwithstanding. I use this as my "tourist" cameras when I don't want or need to carry the big guns. The lens restart issue is a problem, but not a big one for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feature packed and I love the flip display, also the SX10 took some awesome pictures when I was outside shooting (plenty of light). Also, I have to give BIG kudos to Canon support for working with me sadly to no avail on resolving my problem.. 
Cons:. Continued dismal performance of the SX10 in low light conditions.. 
Summary:. After the 2nd SX10 (Canon replaced the 1st one, believed to be faulty) which continued providing the same dismal performance as the 1st one, I had had enough of missing out on photo ops of my two girls; especially after I was taking pictures at my daughter's college indoctrination ceremony and a lady taking pictures with an iPhone photos came out better than mine taken with my SX10. :-(... So, after some extensive research, I chose the FZ35 which arrived via 2 day delivery from Amazon and man I have to tell ya even though I've had it less than a week now, "Out of the Box" it performed as expected, as a high end "Point-and-shoot" camera when shooting in doors. The consistency with which the FZ35 takes quality photos, with minimal to ?NO? mucking around with setting has made me a believer in the Panasonic Lumix FZ35; as a true high end ?point-n-shoot camera out of the box? !!!. Overall, for me, owning the SX10 proved to be both a frustrating and very disappointing ordeal; especially in light of the stellar performance I had received owing my 3 previous Canons A1, AE1 &#38; especially S1IS.. Also, check out this review of the FZ35:. Video Review of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpxHpj4ww1A. Hope this helpssome one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Zooooom.. is incredible. Quick speed zooming in and out.. 
Cons:. Because of the new lens, seems as the camera itself is trying to keep up with. lots of over exposure shots. Speed of shutter kind of lags a bit.. 
Summary:. This is the 3rd model IS camera Ive owned and glad to see they're attempting to do nice upgrades. The lens itself is great with a little wider view and the immense zoom lens. Ive read reviews that it has a faster processor but Ive experienced the shutter (even after manually changing) seems to lag a little. I'm always having to adjust for over-exposure and editing my pics.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great pictures, nice video modes, external flash hot shoe,. 
Cons:. not comfortable in hand, slow zoom, I often would end up pressing something with my thumb on the back just trying to hold it, its too big, lens cap not tethered so its easy to lose, flash does not pop up automatically. 
Summary:. Given the size of this camera - you might as well get a real dSLR. I plan to get either the Nikon D80 or D90 or one of the Canon EOS series.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice zoom, quiet, 4 double "A"s. 
Cons:. Manual focus needs work, the "wheel" just doesn't get it. Needs to be a direct link to lens adjustment.. Auto focus, like many Point and shoot cameras is pretty bad in low light, especially when zoomed out.. Bad file system.. 
Summary:. The camera is alright, but I don't need to hassel over files for the next couple years.. I'm used to a new folder for each days shooting, and each photo numbered consecutively from the very first, and with a date code as part of the number. I usually shoot about 5-10,000 photos a year, and it really helps. Canon has none of these, and if you put in a blank memery card, it all resets to zero. No Fun I'll tell you.. I don't have much else to say, except that I've had the camera 3 days, and I'm shopping for a new one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Telephoto range - no one else comes close. 
Cons:. No battery meter - camera shuts down with no warning.. MOV format for video was a poor choice. NOT compatible with WIndows Media Player or Movie MAker, so cannot play, edit or compile video without purchasing another program. 
Summary:. Like the telephoto, but hate MOV format when everyone else is using MPG or AVI.. My Sony and Nikon both shoot compatible video.. 

$$;
Pros:. Takes great pictures in bright sunlight. Farily compact, AA batteries much better than the propriatory batts.. 
Cons:. Very slow lens speed, even when zoomed out to 2X. Do NOT buy this camera for sports pictures or anything after an hour before sunset. It was unfortunate Canon elected such a cheap lens for such a good camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. seems to be a great camera, though I am still reading the manual. Lots of features, easy to use and simple video buttons.. 
Cons:. a few days into use it would not power up. It had a "lens error" meaning that the lens is stuck 1/2 way and will neither extend nor retract. Seems this is a common problem, and has to go to Canon for repairs - no reset button.. 
Summary:. Can't give a bottom line until I get it back from Canon. This problem is very frustrating as I bought the camera for use on a trip out of the country but had to ship it back to the retailer who is forwarding it to Canon. Canon's web site does not allow for it to be sent to the lab in the country we are visiting for warranty repairs as the info does not match the purchase info. Quite a frustration to not have the camera for (they estimate) 6 to 8 weeks. Will update this when I get the camera back.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has nice features, able to create wonderful photos.. 
Cons:. Camera body cracked at sensor. Notice they redesigned the body for 2010. I've only gotten less than a year out of this camera with no way of getting it fixed without spending a lot of money. Won't purchase another one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wide angle lens is excellent with no distortion. 
Cons:. Image quality. The same shot taken with an S3 and S10, the S3 has less pixelisation.. The wheel is difficult to use, like a loose driving wheel in a car.. The movie quality is worst than with the S3.. 
Summary:. Took the same picture with S3 and S10 Powershot at full zoom, it was a river and the other bank. The houses showed more details in the S10 picture because of more pixel and more zoom, but the water of the river being perfect in the S3 picture, was very pixelised in the S10 picture.. The control wheel is so loose I could not operate the camera properly.. I returned the camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Can't do not own it. 
Cons:. Can't do not own it. 
Summary:. I am looking for a camera for date/stamp because my job (livilihood) relies on photos with date stamp. I thought my Sony DSC-S700 had date/stamp but I would have to have all the equipment and know-how of the above (AND I DO NOT) in order to print photos with the date .I just lost a case in a lawsuit because i did not have date/stamp on my photos, for those of you who cannot understand WHY a date stamp on a photo is soi mportant. It is a legal document. Try getting a traffic ticket and have the officer show a date stamp photo with you in it...MUY IMPORTANTE! Now do you understand? This review IS helpful ! Thank you! .... so I do not buy another camera that does not put the date/stamp on the picture. And as stated you can always turn this function off.. PS I am 55.. 

$$;
Pros:. A decent camera, has many features found on SLR cameras.. 
Cons:. Camera has an image flaw. Sent it in over a month ago for repairs and I still don't have it! Last email I received said it would be fixed within 7 days. A phone call to customer service revealed that parts were back ordered.. 
Summary:. Crap. Buy a Nikon, Sony or Kodak. Anything other than a Canon.. Continuing from above CONS. Customer service is lousy. Why they couldn't send me an email or call me regarding the problem for the repair is beyond comprehension? I need my camera frequently for work and pleasure. Since the customer service rep had no idea when the back ordered parts would be available, I asked that a "loaner" be sent. Nope. Not Possible. How about a new replacement? Nope. Not Possible. Meanwhile I have no camera nor any date for its return. Unbelievable. Buy something else!!!!!! I am pissed!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good alround mega zoom features and picture quality in a reasonably priced camera with increased AA battery capacity.. 
Cons:. This camera has NO DATE/TIME STAMP feature or capability. This glaring defect makes this camera useless for my applications.. 
Summary:. I purchased this camera to upgrade from my Cannon A560 because I needed more zoom and battery capacity.. The camera features are very good BUT the SX10 is DOES NOT have the capability to put a DATE/TIME STAMP on the pictures.. I just got off the phone with Cannon Tech Support at 1-800-385-2155 and the Tech Support person assured me there is NO WAY to make this camera mark a date/time stamp on the pictures. Not only this but the Cannon SX1 is does not have date/time stamp capability either! I hope the tech support person was wrong but it appears not.. I cannot believe cannon would produce a camera in this class without date/time stamp capability! The Date/Time stamp is a very common if not universal and standard feature on nearly ALL digital cameras.. This is tantamount to manufacturing automobiles with no seatbelts or windshield wipers!!!!!. I was better off with my Cannon A560. Cannon used to make the best line of camera's on the market in my opinion........ apparently Cannon is taking notes from American manufactures and throwing quality and common sense out the window.. A camera with NO DATE/TIME stamp feature that is selectible is of NO USE to me. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. It won't take up much space in a landfill.. 
Cons:. It has a lot of symbols and buttons, the manual doesn't fully explain most of it, follow instructions on what you may want and they don't work, and video feature goes no further than my computer. Whoopie.. 
Summary:. It is an overrated piece of electronic crap that shouldn't be allowed in the market place. This tirade comes from wanting to do multiple shutter takes with one depression of button, and I can't tell if camera can do that, and manual doesn't refer to anything about it. Thus, it's of no use to me. I spent hours trying to get video passed my computer and that's a no-go as well. It takes fair pictures, and I could have saved a ton of money by buying throwaway cameras.. 

$$;
Pros:. Only the HD video is good quality. The rest of the images (stills) are POOR as the camera's hardware continues to fail.. 
Cons:. There is now a known defect with the CMOS processor on the SX10 IS as they are failing with regularity right out of the box. See for yourself as you read more reviews, Canon is still in the denial stage. I want my money back.. 
Summary:. I hope Canon implements a refund plan to reimburse all the unfortunate customers like myself for this very defective product. The bottom line is Canon would be wise to discontinue the SX10 IS until it is overhauled..
