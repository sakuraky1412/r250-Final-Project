dear reader , the service and atmosphere at imagine villa hotel is beyond excellency so much so that we had stayed for 4 nights , we then left to go to our next destination ( buckingham place near tangalle ) but buckingham p was so terrible that we rang marnix at imagine and asked if we could return for a further 4 nights and we were kindly accommodated .
the staff are all exceptionally happy and work together as a team - this is really evident and nothing is too much to ask for , so helpful , and the staff speak good english .
in fact , it was so wonderful that the staff woke us one night to tell us a turtle was hatching eggs on the beach - we and another couple went down and enjoyed this truly spectacular moment with marnix and the staff . . . . .
there is none of this business where people get up early and claim beds - the villa with 9 rooms accommodates everyone round the pool and also has beds / loungers around the grounds so you can just dream whilst you look out to sea .
the owner , marnix is a gentleman and we thank marnix , wiji and the other staff for what we perceived as the best place that we have ever stayed , the way we were treated and for making our holiday so very special. .
what you must understand about imagine is that there is no time concept for dinner and that you eat when you are ready to eat so forget been stuck to a certain time .
both are excellent but the value for the 4 course meal is very reasonable and we had this every night with a changing menu .
have a pre-drink and just wander to your table when you are ready - the staff are there to serve you .
there are two differing menus , one is the a la carte and the other is the buffet which is 4 course .
absolutely hats off to wiji the chef , the food is michelin quality and most beautifully presented .
