after trying out the zune pc software , i decided to buy a zunehd , even though i live in australia and had no access to the marketplace  .
i is looking for a portable device to save me carrying a cd wallet and disc    person on business trips  .
i also wanted to be able to show my tv/video graphics work to potential clients in meetings , etc  .
, so video quality is also a factor  .
at no time did i consider that any mp3 player could possibly compete with the tactile experience of owning a substantial cd collection [mine is around 1000] , i saw it merely as a convenience for times when i is away from home boy , is i wrong  .
within a week zunehd had become the centre of my music listening , both at home and everywhere else  .
at first i loaded up a few thousand songs , which is completely effortless , and tested it out on headphones and through portable speakers and my home stereo  .
i is immediately impressed with it's ease    of    use , the well thought out user    interface and the sound quality on offer  .
i is very happy with my purchase and glad i had taken a chance on a device only available overseas [thanks to ebay] after a few days i thought i would go to my local mcdonalds and try out the wi    fi over a cup of coffee  .
i spent half    an    hour or so going through my daily ritual of checking a few motoring sites and the experience is about what i had expected    not up to the standard of surfing on my pc but certainly doable if needed  .
typing long comments is not great but short replies to emails , etc would be easy enough  .
all good later on , i went to choose an album to listen to while i prepared dinner and noticed a previously unseen black white photo suddenly appearing in the background of the player  .
then i remembered that the device automagically downloads media related to the artists in the collection  .
i thought that is pretty cool and after dinner took the time to check it out more thoroughly  .
it turns out that i had a wealth of photos , bios and other useful stuff about a large percentage of my collection , including some of the more obscure stuff i occasionally like to listen to  .
death in june had a lengthy biography  .
i spent most of the rest of that evening looking through at all this new information generously gifted me by my zunehd  .
it prompted me to go and buy a long cable so i could look through all this cool stuff while i listen to music , in exactly the same way you might look through a cd booklet while you listen to the disc in the few months since , i don't think i have listened to a cd  .
zunehd has become my default device and whilst i will continue to buy cds for my collection , from now on i will only listen to them as mp3s on my zunehd  .
in fact , i've just ordered a 64gb zunehd and the av dock , now that windoze phone 7 seems to have prompted microsoft to open up the zune marketplace here [just for movies at the moment]  .
i'm not a big film watcher , i prefer good tv shows , but i would not be surprised at all if zune hd changes that , too p  .
i want to mention that i am not a microsoft fan    boi  .
that said , i think microsoft have really lifted their game of late and i am really glad i is open    minded enough to give zune a go  .
the success of that venture has prompted me to take a good look at bing and i've been impressed by that , too  .
if they can do as good a job on wndoze phone 7 , i think there may be some hope for them  .
in fact , more and more i am seeing google in the same way i used to look at microsoft  .
maybe being the underdog brings out the best in global corporations  .
the zune is a product that can travel with anybody anywhere , it is something that i believe is one of the bet produts of there on the market  .
with me being in the military i do travel a lot and with all the long plane rides we are always on having that kind of battery power and being able to put a varity of music , videos , and pictures onto one device make out travel a little lighter , thank you to all the people who put in the hard work at microsoft for producing such a great produt .
as stated above , the user interface and speed of the interface is the best i have ever used  .
yes , this includes apple products superior sound quality , although you will need to upgrade the headphones  .
the included buds are nearly useless  .
i now use klipsch , which i am please with  .
even $20    $30 skull candy buds are a big improvement video playback is fantastic on the oled screen  .
i have not purchased the hdmi dock to try viewing hd video through my home entertainment system , but would like to try it  .
it just is not necessary at this time great build quality  .
sexy looking player  .
get a lot of compliments on it  .
the zune marketplace coupled with the zune pass is probably the best way to experience , download , and purchase the music you want  .
well worth the $15/mo  .
, as you get to pick 10 songs a month to keep forever  .
streaming through the marketplace is also included , and when using smartdj , you get to experience a lot of new artists , and some that have been around a while , that you might not have been aware of a very engaging music experience via zune marketplace and the device itself hd radio is top notch  .
i like that i can tag songs i hear on the radio , and download them from the marketplace apps are not really my thing , nor the reason i purchased this fantastic device i have the few apps that are available , downloaded , but rarely use them  .
what they do , they do well , but again , not my gig ; just figured i would give them a try .
you are not slaved to one service for music or videos , the zune hd is an amazing product for a reasonable price .
this thing is more worth it than the i touch especailly in audio quality  .
i am swept away by this first generation zune hd , i cannot wait to see what microsoft adds in the next generation .
this is a great product for music listeners who love music discovery  .
music discovery options include smart dj , that selects music like a partiuclar artist , recommendatoins (either through marketplace or channels) that picks music it thinks you'll like , through channels where music is selected based on popularity within genre or expert opinion , through mix    view where you can graphically see which artists relate to ones you like as well as listeners who have similar tastes , and through the social network where you can see what your friends are listening to  .
this is completely and totally about music discovery and , if you love music , this is the device hands    down it is a great video player as well and they've recently expanded the types of videos that are handled natively  .
i do not use it much for that , but when i want it , it is there and looks great it has a few apps that are well done  .
twitter , facebook , car racing , other arcade    type games , and a few utilities  .
with those and the web browser it is not a big deal to be without others unless you are expecting a gps device or something the video output is via a dock that retails for $85 , but there is a $45 version (typically available for $39) that works as well but you'd have to supply your own hdmi cable i bought my from zune originals and enjoy the customization (can pick color and graphic) although it is a bit less expensive from discount retailers fantastic device  .
updated  .
on jun 18 , 2010  .
when the zune hd gets more apps it will easily blow the ipod touch away .
i boycott apple , so i is pleased to see a compareable product on teh market  .
i absolutely love teh zune software , which is very intuitive to handle  .
zune store needs some catching up with content compared with itunes , but that will come  .
just glad i did not have to but an ipod .
i think this a great product but i think the psp go is tied with this since its really an all in one  .
the umd's were really messy and makes a huge mess  .
it can store music , video , pictures , and it can still go onto the internet  .
it has awesome in depth games unlike the ipod touch which has on the surface games like tap tap revenge or touchgrind which only let you do the same thing over and over again  .
i have to say though , i think gran turismo for the psp is not worth it even though i'm a big fan  .
the gtbycitroen car is awesome  .
its also a revolution in going green and racing as a hybrid racer .
i would highly recommend the zune hd to anybody who is looking for the best music player  .
the zune pass puts itunes to shame and encourages people to branch out and listen to new songs and artists  .
the hd radio is much better than i though and very high quality  .
the device itself is sleek and easy to operate  .
i am also glad that the focus of this player is music and not apps or billion dollar ad campaigns  .
it seems like zune is created by music lovers , for music lovers (even though that sounds very cliche) .
if you cannot get an ipod , love the idea behind subscription service (millions to download    one fee to pay for unlimited access    think netflix for music) , and want a very complete experience there is no other this is the best mp3 player out bar    none .
overall , love my zune 32hd and got one for my 8yr old for his birthday  .
now my older son want to replace his ipod with a zune  .
woohoo  .
this is an amazing product  .
and i love it don't listen to what other people say they are just stuck and mad with there i    pods  .
i love this new zune but if you want a real gameing system and not an actual mp3 player (what it is) do not get it  .
i like this product becouse it is the newest good music device since ipod touch  .
ok i don't have a zune hd but i still wanna speak my opinion  .
first of all the interface looks way better then the ipod touch  .
second of all why is the zune always compared to the touch anyway  .
third who really caries around there mp3 player ever where they go  .
i mean seriously you do not see people around walmart shopping and listing to a mp3 player  .
then why do you need all of these apps  .
really there is an internet browser on it  .
so in my point of view the zune is just way better then the ipod touch since its always compared to the touch  .
the zune out performs the touch hands down  .
when it comes to apps , the touch will always win  .
i personally , don't give two shizzes about apps  .
in my opinion , they slow performance of the media player , reduce battery life , and    .
i have a computer for that stuff  .
i do not need that  .
what i need is unbeatable playback quality , and the zune hd delivers that  .
sound quality compared to the touch is outstanding  .
video quality is no comparison  .
battery life sure exceeds the touch as well  .
i am an audiophile  .
for people that do not know what that is , use a dictionary  .
i have a pair of $300 headphones , that sound like garbage on a touch , but the zune hd brings them to life  .
i'm in the market for a media player that can offer insane sound quality without sacrifising any performance  .
the zune hd delivers  .
all audiophiles know that ipods sound reproduce garbage like sound , muffled and tinny  .
the zune opens up everything possible  .
bring your headphones to life with the zune hd , and your eyes because of the amazing video quality  .
there is no hold button , which i am not happy , nor disappointed about  .
so i didnt mention it in a pro or con  .
the pros and cons on it are offset  .
all in all , this is the best media player money can buy  .
buy only if you want the best possible media playback on an mp3 , not for apps .
a must have for all music junkies , and portable media fanatics .
lately i have been using for the most part a sony x series walkman , which by no means is a less than spectacular media player but it had recently broke and to be honest i had been waiting for an excuse to get the zune hd  .
as it turns out i finally have one and i couldn't be happier  .
everything about it is amazing  .
the sound quality is stellar , the brushed metal finish resists fingerprints and looks like ten different kinds of sexy , and the overall build quality feels solid in your hand  .
the ui is brilliantly thought out and one can figure out how to fully navigate the player in a matter of minutes  .
the internet browser is definitely solid for a portable media player and can handle most tasks easily enough  .
as far as the apps are concerned , at the moment there are only a few and they're not bad but there's definitely room to grow  .
with a respectable app marketplace for the zune hd , i'm pretty sure it will be able to trump the ipod touch in every aspect  .
call me a fanboy but i do respect the ipod touch and what it does , but i just think the zune took it and made , to what matters to me anyway , improvements on everything  .
the only thing that i would have changed about this godsend is that the button on the side of the player brings up media controls , ie , changing the volume or skipping tracks  .
this is kind of silly since to use that feature you would have to be looking at the player , and if you're going to be looking at the player you can simply touch the screen to bring up the same controls  .
this i think would have been much better suited to be a track skipping , rocker switch or something since i usually like to change tracks while it's in my pocket  .
however since the overall quality of the player is so stellar , it can be for the most part overlooked  .
basically , if you do not have a media player , get a zune hd  .
if you do have one , sell it , and get a zune hd  .
i love the zune hd far more than i do the itouch i used to have  .
its media quality is better , and i don't care about games on the zune , i really do not want to play games on a 3 inch screen anyway .
apple needs to stop riding apple's d k  .
i had an ipod classic , ipod nano 2g , ipod nano 4g , and i used to the ipod touch 3g  .
i will never own an apple ipod/apple products ever again  .
worst customer service  .
their pmp's break easily  .
the zune hd is amazing .
even with the limited apps and non adjustable eq , i love my zune hd  .
i take it everywhere  .
i can surf the net using the wi    fi feature , download music from other sources and add them to my music collection in the zune program  .
the hd radio is awesome  .
i get a lot of hd stations (including our local community college station which i had never be able to get before)  .
zune marketplace subscription is great with the 10 song downloads every month  .
i also hook my zune up to my 42 lcd tv using the docking station and watch the movies or videos i have downloaded in hd quality  .
i am really happy with it .
beats an ipod touch into oblivion .
i would like to know why people post reviews on the zune hd when they do not own one  .
especially people who are apple freaks  .
an apple   i mean freak only offers a look at the zune through the eyes of a retard  .
they do not offer any good info and they always say the zune sucks  .
i want reviews of the object not by apple people or microsoft people , i want reviews from owners  .
and all i have to say is that i own this product an i believe this is a far superior product to the ipod    touch .
this player is so good it prompted me to ditch my itouch on ebay  .
the zune hd's sound quality is much better than the ipod line and while they may not have that many apps available yet the future of this device is very bright  .
bottom line is if you are a music fan this player is for you , not to mention the $14  .
99 zunepass subscription that is available which is phenomenal for either discovering new music or helping you build an awesome library  .
the ui and software are also a huge upgrade over the spreadsheetesque crash happy itunes software .
this is a great device and is most certainly not a copy of any of apple's products  .
this is it's own device and has it's own features , and people will have to choose what is best for them .
if you want a great media player , buy a zune  .
i personally do not see the need for so many useless apps personally  .
i bought the zune so that i could listen to music  .
and anyone willing to put the money out to buy a mac is a die hard apple fan and there is no point trying to convince them to switch to a microsoft product it would be a huge waste of money for microsoft .
32gb , aluminum construction , killer looks , good battery life , hd out , hd radio , oled screen feels as good as hd , apps are lacking but the device has only been out a couple of months , apple offers more apps but the vast majority are completely boring and useless  .
saying you offer 5 , 000 apps is not that impressive when half of them are power up the lightsaber or kick the baby  .
i've owned 3 ipods and 2 zunes , i personally love my zunes much more than the ipods  .
don't get me wrong , the ipod line is a great line but i wouldn't buy them for the same reason i would not buy a mac , you pay alot for the same if not less .
all around the best toy i have  .
i use the internet at home or wifi at any hot spot , i listen to any type of music that i want from my 7 , 500 downloaded tunes with plenty of room for podcast  .
sure i pay an extra $15  .
00 a month for zune market place but my return is10 fold , for my $15  .
00 investment i have choices of several million songs or more to down load , i can build play lists of my favorite songs and the best part is every month i choose 10 song that i can download and keep forever  .
now tell me that this not a perfect world .
to get an i    touch or a zune hd really depends on what you are setting out to do  .
if you are looking to play some fun little games or have some cool apps that can calculate your dinner bill , then get the itouch  .
but if you are looking for a premium media experience , then get a zune hd  .
zune hd music quality is better , you can wireless sinc the zune hd to your pc , which is awesome  .
so i can be sitting at work or at school and be like , oh , i want that new podcast that came out today or something  .
and as long as there's wi    fi wherever you are , you just click the button on the zune hd and it updates all of your media in less than 5 minutes  .
you can also wirelessly purchase songs on your zune hd  .
also , there is the zune pass , where you pay $15 per month and recieve unlimited access to more than 4 million songs on the zune software , which is awesome  .
and as long as you have a decent pc , the zune software is superior to itunes  .
more visual fun to use with better music and it can choose music that you should like based on what you listen to most from your collection , like genius on itunes , but it actually does a good job   )  .
great device  .
you will love it .
ipod touch + itunes + $15    ipod w/ 15 songs  .
zune hd + zune pass + $15    zune full of music  .
sure the zune pass music is not yours , but that is why it is called rent music  .
you rent movies , why not rent music  .
some people can rent a movie once and then buy it  .
some people can rent it twice and never want to see it again  .
the same goes with music , people  .
i can hear a song 10 times and then be done with it  .
does that mean i sound have paid a dollar for it  .
deleting a song that i paid a dollar for in the first place would be even more aquard zune pass for me is the way to go  .
hear all the music i want with aritst pictures , bio info , and similar artist recommendations , all right there on the zune hd unit itself  .
if i love them , i'll buy them  .
if i do not , i can delete them  .
guilt free and worry free  .
zune's focus is on the music listening experience  .
that is why i am keeping my zune hd  .
apps or not  .
i have a netbook for that .
buy one now  .
you will fall in love with this device  .
the way it works is simply perfect  .
its a media player not a me too device  .
excellent better    then    any    other    mp3    player sound quality , amazing video , built like a military grade weapon  .
it's almost too good to be true .
obviously it doesnt matter if the oled screen is horrible in sunlight , all other electronic devices [ie , phones , cameras , mps players] are bad in direct sunlight anyways the oled screen actually takes less power than the screens ipod uses and the older zunes use , and are brighter , giving it a win    win  .
you won't be using your zune too often in the sunlight anyways im sure , unless your just listening to music yes , you do have to subscribe to zune marketplace to use it , but , i have never subscribed and still use it  .
i just use limewire and it automatically puts it on my zune library  .
you have to change your folder setting on zune software to get it to work , duh also , everybody else is in the ipod craze , and while it may have some points over zune , when it comes to listening to music , zune is out of the water compared to ipod  .
i would not think it would matter if ipod had more apps , etc ; because your buying a damn mp3 player , not a gameboy most of the apps are useless and you have to pay for a lot of them  .
zune is here for music , not overloading you with apps and all kinds of gadgets , taking away from the experience its supposed to be zunes may not have as much advancement when it comes to internet , but once again , its an mp3 player , not a computer the ipod is bulky , and ugly in my opinion  .
the speaker on it is almost useless , when will you have an audience for music  .
overall i would say the zune is much better , i want to buy an mp3 player to listen to music , not play games and have maps and shop for wine  .
you can get a phone for that  .
zune doesnt need bells and whistles to make themselves look better , they already are  .
the zune hd has got everything you would need in an mp3/mp4 player , and then some  .
you have your great navigation , then you have the zune marketplace and the social , which is just flat out incredible  .
then you have that tegra chip in there  .
the chip really speeds things up and makes for a great user experience  .
also , there is the amazing oled screen  .
that screen , with the blackest of blacks and the richest of colors always leaves me in awe  .
overall , one of the best products i have ever seen .
if you want the best portable music player out there , then look no further  .
this kills the ipod touch for musical performance  .
the oled screen is a thing of beauty , it is so easy to scroll through pics and music  .
i have over 15gb of songs already and it is a breeze to locate them  .
the wifi is easy to use and finds the local hotspots with no trouble  .
i am not a microsoft lover as until windows 7 their operating systems were flawed but you have to hand it to them  .
this is way , way better than any apple product out there  .
kudos to you mr  .
gates for stepping up the plate finally  .
my overall experience with the zune hd has been superb  .
zune listened to what the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd generation owners wanted and implemented this into the new device  .
all in all there is a lot that can be improved and a lot that is better left alone , for the price that i paid for the 32g zune hd i am one happy camper .
microsoft's reboot of the zune franchise is a risk that will pay off finally  .
as a long    time ipod/iphone user , the zune hd brings the portable audio/video experience to a whole new level that should rank it as the ultimate best    of    breed media player device .
http  //thetechnomonkey  .
blogspot  .
com/ ultimately , this it what it comes down to .
so let me get this straight my zune pass makes my zune more expensive then my ipod which i buy i buy songs for at $  .
99 a pop  .
try again mr  .
bell  .
i have both a zune hd and an ipod touch  .
let me tell you the sound is better then my ipod at all settings  .
and it is far cheaper then buying songs from itunes  .
the ipod user interface also sucks , people only think it's good because that's what they are told to believe  .
lets look at it i can play a song in two click on my zune , i had a sony mp3 player that is a twist of my thumb to do just about every thing  .
my ipod takes half a dozen movements to play any thing  .
how is that easier  .
the zune hd has its place  .
if you prefer apps over sound and video quality go for a touch and you will be happy with it  .
if sound and video quality are important to you go with the zune hd  .
my zune 120 is stolen and i had to use an ipod until i got my zune hd  .
i cant even enjoy listening to music on an ipod anymore its like going back to vhs  .
internet connectivity is sometimes spotty , not a huge problem  .
also flash support is nonexistent now but with the release of flash 10  .
1 its a possibility considering it supports almost all mobile devices also to those not willing to fork over $90 for a docking station with tv out the zune hd to compatible with the zune home av pack version 2 for around $15  .
im not sure if it can handle hd out but it does have component jacks as well as rca and av adapter .
still miss the old brick , but forced to move on and thoroughly enjoying it  .
would love to have mac support .
the zune hd is not a full on competitor to the ipod touch it does what the touch does and in certain cases does it better  .
the oled screen is not good in daylight but the ipod is not good either most screens are not good in daylight  .
the tegra chip in the zune is worlds better than what is in the ipod it has multiple cores which can shut off certain functions of the zune when they are not in use nothing in the ipod does that  .
the app store is still in development and therefore cannot be compared to the apple app store even at its release because apple had an sdk released with its app store which is not available for the zune yet  .
other than these things mentioned the zune does what the ipod does it plays video on a nicer screen but its smaller and it plays songs with sound quality just as good if not better than the ipod when it comes to interface thats subjective the zune is louder than apple's minimalist interface and that is strictly a prefernce .
if you like music , buy the zune hd .
i use wmp and is able to play my entire collection on the zune  .
didnt have to convert to other formats just to use it best player iv ever owned better then the ipod i had  .
this product is for someone who wants a pmd which is not an apple product  .
or if you are a serious music person zune pass and hd radio makes this a homerun .
i'm speechless  .
it's an amazing media player .
the cnet review is really ridiculous  .
in the prizefight video , they give the ipod touch (which i own) big points for ease of navigation  .
they then say that the zune has much better sound quality than the touch , but that no one cares  .
you can not be serious  .
maybe the twenty somethings doing these reviews have never actually listened to high quality audio , but many of us thirty and ups remember listening to music before ipods dumbed everything down to the crappy audio quality we're listening to today  .
to weight minor differences in navigation schemes higher than sound quality is total bs also , i would give the zune the edge over the touch just because of fm capability  .
every time i go to the gym , where the audio feeds for the tv monitors are broadcast in fm , i wished i had an fm receiver in my touch  .
hell , even the crappy iriver mp3 player i had 10 years ago had fm  .
anyway , cnet reviews are really worthless to anyone looking for good , unbiased information .
i like because it has an oled display  .
if you are a video and music enthusiastic you'll love this device , and the software do not have forget about the zune pass only $ 15 for unlimited music for 3 devices 3 computers .
the best device for your bucks  .
the only reason i gave the zune hd a first look is because of the nvidia tegra processor in it  .
after looking that first time i realized that it is offering substantially more than tegra  .
the hardware inside it is not even comparable to other music and video players  .
the zune hd has a ridiculous amount of processing power compared to its competition  .
currently there is not the biggest community , and that is what i see most people complain about when they attempt to compare this to the ipod touch  .
how better to start building a community than to produce a solid product with countless possibilities  .
i suspect the community and app complaint will be remedied soon enough because the zune hd is the most popular zune yet  .
this attention will build the community that ipod fans laugh at  .
bottom line this is one solid device that came along with a beautiful software update  .
it is sure to please anyone who purchases it .
if you love music this is the best device money can buy  .
there is no beating zunepass , for $14 a month you (and 2 more family members) can get access to millions of songs and you even get to buy 10 songs a month for free so essentially you are only paying $4 more which i think is a awesome deal  .
zune  .
s smartdj does an excellent job of creating playlists based on artists you like and given the millions of songs available with zunepass it creates some very interesting compilations  .
if you are not into music zune is not for you  .
s a pmp first everything else second  .
if you want a mini pocket computer which can also play music , zune is not for you , at least not yet .
for the reason that i bought the zune hd , which is to carry music with me , the zune hd is the best option for the money  .
while i is happy with the zune 30 that i carried until the zune hd arrived , microsoft has certain trumped it in sound quality  .
a lot of people , myself being one of them , never updated from the 30 because of the outstanding software / firmware updates from microsoft that kept it relevant  .
the addition of hd radio in the hd and the massive improvements all around finally made me take the leap and there is no doubt that it is the right choice i'm sure that i don't have anything new to share with anyone who is reading this review so i wo not waste time going over all of the great and wonderful but i will say that i'm already building a small wish list for a future update (which they provide for free) first , i'd like to see the ability to set browser options easily  .
next , give us the option to exit out of the browser without hitting the home button , just like when we're playing music or video and want to move on to something else  .
finally , i want the ability to set up a custom eq now for the one thing that cannot be added in firmware bluetooth  .
i use my phone right now to stream music to my bluetooth headset when i'm working out or to my motorcycle helmet when i'm on the road  .
that's additional battery power i'm using from the phone while the zune sits charging in all , i have no complaints about picking up the zune and have bought a second one for my wife  .
yes , the ipod has more options right now in terms of apps and accessories , but , that's just because of the amount of time that it's been on the market and the fact that microsoft really was not doing a ton of marketing until lately  .
just as bing has been steadily gaining in popularity and windows 7 is finally breaking through the m$ sux attitude that so many people out there have , the zune is making positive waves  .
competition is always a good thing and with the sea of pmps out there when it comes to top of the line devices the ipod and zune are sitting far ahead of the crowd .
the zune hd has almost everything you need a portable media player , and the stuff thats not ther it will soon have  .
typical how cnet under rates superior devices like the zune hd and over raties ipods and anything apple related  .
the best mp3 player , zune hd , is released this month , the best os , windows7 , next month , microsoft is on a roll  .
best ui on a pmp  .
they discredit the zune for limited video formats when the ipod only supports 1 video format and does not even support hd yet they dont nay say apple for that  .
the ipod is too closed and outdated  .
the interface is old and boring  .
the zune is sleek , has more support and the monthly subscription is optional  .
you can still pay for songs individually at comparable costs as itunes  .
then cnet goes on to complain that u have to use the zune marketplace which easier to use than itunes yet dont complain about ipods having to use itunes  .
its not microsofts fault that morons use tachnology and cant do simple math  .
and if not too stupid then too lazy  .
its unfortunate that so many customers take the words of so called experts when the actual consumers are rating the xune higher than the ipod touch  .
i have lost all respect for cnet because they no longer have any credibility  .
and working in electronic retail you can bet i will convince some customers as well  .
either they review their reviews or down with cnet .
i would love to get a zune hd , the fm radio , the simple os , design , you can get a 32 gb model thats less than the ipod touch , and you can personalize it with zune originals  .
the only reason i don't have one is because i don't know if you can put digital copies on it , i use itunes currently and don't know if i can transfer my songs to the zune marketplace , and the last time i tried the marketplace , all it did is search for the artist and when i did manage to find it , it said it is out of stock or was not available , and there are not as many songs , so if i could still use itunes or transfer the songs and use my digital copies , i would get it in a heart beat .
biggest con of all is not the phone is the hate it involves in apple fan boys that always try so compare a new device , phone , ect with apps to the apple store not taking into account this came out last week market brand new just opened and apples app store has been open since 2001 to everyone considering getting or have a zune hd remember its new and has a lot more capabilities then any current apple product and will only grow better in time the tegra processor is an entire computer on a chip on another chip with hd playback u cannot beat that its just sweet  .
why is cnet so ipod pro  .
if you want all these apps , then get the iphone  .
same price and you know what you get a phone  .
its really hard to mess around with apps while your driving your car , or running , biking and listening to some tunes on your home stereo  .
f    ing dumb .
if you love your music and videos , go with the zune  .
i mean , 15$ a month for 3 computers and 3 zunes for unlimited music is by far the best deal  .
to top it off , 10 free downloads per a month  .
at 99 cents a song , you would be paying 10$ for that with apple , with microsoft your only paying 5 dollars extra to rent the other music  .
the oled screen is really amazing on most videos  .
really makes the video pop right out at you and almost appear 3d sure it might not have as many apps , but the hardware on this thing is truly untapped at the moment and has great potential  .
if you love music and videos , go with a zune  .
sure you download them via torrent or emule , but why take the risk or hassle at 15$ a month  .
also on size , it really does look bigger in the previews  .
i got mine and is amazed at how slim it was , not bulky whatsoever  .
you can dl music right from your zune via wifi , which is a great feature  .
find a song on the radio , tag it and download it later but even this player is not perfect  .
ms needs to work on    .
the web browser  .
the apps and release a api  .
drop the social stuff , its pointless  .
get flash on this thing and allow us to play flash games  .
please integrate zune music/marketplace into xbox360  .
i want to play music on the xbox without my computer streaming updated  .
on sep 21 , 2009  .
this is by far the best digital media player on the market    bar none  .
i do not compare it to the ipod touch as to me they are different  .
the touch is designed to be more than a dmp based on it's lame music interface  .
however , the touch does blow the zune hd away in web browsing , mail client and other computer related functions  .
but , like i said , i want a dmp and the zune hd delivers better than anything i've ever used  .
i wo not rehash everything that is already written about the zhd , but i do have to disagree with one negative the editor wrote real world cost assumes you'll be putting music on your music player whether it's an ipod or a zune  .
at $14  .
99 per month for unlimited music vs  .
99 per track on itunes , the real world cost is  significantly  lower for the zune , by as much as several thousand dollars depending on how many tracks we're talking about ms really , really needs to beef up the games and apps selection , and there need to be way more accessories made for this device  .
beyond that , it's absolutely stunning and is worth giving it a chance .
i swear cnet is bought off by apple seriously can i see a review about the product instead saying what thing the writer thinks is better in an ipod just because his pride of ownership in ipod clouds his opinion  .
this review is based purely on the writers  .
personal biased opinion and it irritates me to no end  .
bottom line is the zune hd is the best handheld media device on the market and you wont be disappointed in anyway  .
with the stunning hd display and smooth playback powered by the sexy nvidia tegra apx 2600  .
what more can you ask for .
for media , this is best thing available    it is sexy , small light and cutting edge internals    oled and tegra    deadly combination  .
i do fail to see the justification in the review why the zune pass is more expensive than owning an ipod touch , buying individual tracks/albums and software    simply saying that 14  .
99/month or 180/year is a lot extra (when you keep 1 album a month , take off $120 ($10  12 mths) and you have only $60 to unlimited access to music you want to listen to and can download straight to the device when you want  .
i have owned creative mp3 players , ipods , gigabeats and the last two zune models    this by far is the best blend of all the devices i have owned  .
people complain about storage    i have over 30gb of music , but when is the last time you listen to all of that at once    zune software makes it so easy to sync what you want with sync groups    browser is such a suprise compared to my winmo phone , and the apps will get there    if you do not think apple is threatened by this device , why would they get video games developed for the touch  .
this is really not a review , jut trying to find what is playing on there , like where that kid is jumping , thanks a bunches who knows   ) .
i find it supports many video formats , seeing as how it actually supports hd video codecs  .
the addition of the equalizer is great for improving the already good audio quality , i find the frequency response of 20    20000 hz for the ipod to be disappointing  .
hd video out is an awesome addition , i forsee many uses for a portable media center  .
also , when the math is done , it is actually cheaper to purchase the zune pass for 100 years than to fill an ipod classic once  .
and without thousands of dollars lying around , i would not be able to fill said ipod for quite awhile the ability to read the bio , and related artists , without an internet connection is sweet  .
the screensaver effect has everyone wowed , and has me watching it for awhile sometimes  .
the marketplace interface loads much faster than in previous zunes , thus making it more useable  .
i find its lack of wireless n unfortunate , but the device seems to make do with what it got  .
hd radio is a good addition as well , because you can tag songs that much easier  .
with regular fm stations , at least in my area , not very many of them transmitted song data , so it is hard to use the tagging feature with previous zunes , as you had to be using specific radio stations  .
with hd radio , all the stations i have used transmit song data , thus allowing me to tag songs and download them at a later date  .
and the other night , i is at a mcdonalds , and i must say , the deal they have with zunes works well , and i had no problem connecting to their network and using internet there without any kind of dialog , and it even showed up as a known network on the zune itself .
great product  .
i like the fact that i am not using itunes software whichis grossly inefficient and not a good quality program    it slows my pc down  .
also like the fact that you do not have to download music on itunes to play on this device  .
great features all around    more than all the other devices i reviewed  .
you cannot go wrong here .
the biggest concern is a bigger app catalog , if microsoft can come up with an idea to showcase their features of the zune the ipod touch want have a chance , such as having netflix streaming ability from the zune hd in hd format over wifi , that would kill the ipod  .
remember back when your 56k dial    up isp went from a very limited timed internet usage per month to unlimited all you can eat usage  .
remember when your cellphone provider made your text messaging plan and voice calls to other people on the network unlimited for a flat rate  .
unlimited access fundamentally changes the way you use devices and the amount of time and enjoyment you get out of them  .
zune pass does this for mp3 players allowing you to take any song you like  .
hear a brand new song or a classic favorite on the zune's fm radio that you really like  .
no reason to hesitate  .
click the purchase button on the radio screen and next time you connect to the internet it will download the song to your zune  .
heck take the whole album while you're at it , zune pass is all you can eat  .
by the end of the month you can choose 10 songs to keep forever so you'll automatically own 120 songs by the end of the year  .
that is zune pass and it's wonderful as i've just described it but it gets even better the zune 4  .
0 software , which is the best , fastest , and most eye    pleasing music/marketplace i've ever used now has a feature called smart dj  .
this feature doesn't just create playlists for you out of your own collection of mp3's , if you choose it can pull songs off of the zune marketplace that you don't own and suggests them to you based upon your song preferences  .
now once you combine zune pass with this new feature you have something really special  .
like an itunes genius on steroids you can start grabbing music you like off of zune marketplace by the handfuls as you discover new artists and albums  .
and then there are the hundreds of premade playlists you can download from the zune marketplace conveniently ranked in order of popularity  .
these playlists include things like the 100 most popular songs from any year in the last 30 years  .
want the best songs from 1985  .
a couple of clicks and they're all on your zune in a playlist  .
how about all the songs that won a grammy this year or all the songs that were nominated for a vma  .
they're all yours with zune pass  .
you can also subscribe to channels like the billboard top 40 and have the top music in the country automatically synced to your zune every week  .
you see people write off zune pass as little more than renting music when it's so much more than that  .
it's more like having a personal chef live in your home with a menu of hundreds of dishes he can instantly prepare for you  .
having an mp3 player without a zune pass is like having an xbox without xbox live  .
zune pass opens up a whole new experience with music like you've never had on an ipod or in itunes and lets talk about the experience of using the new zune 4  .
0 software for the pc  .
it's phenomenal  .
whether you get a zune hd or not , you must go to the zune website right now and download this software  .
i guarantee you will fall in love with zune 4  .
0 the instant you discover the artist view visualizer in the now playing section  .
when the zune software starts pulling down the images of your favorite artists from the songs you are playing and displaying their bio info and data on how many people have played their songs on the zune network you will start to fall in love  .
this is the future of album art and liner notes  .
the people who made this software truly love music as much as you do and they treat the experience of playing and discovering new music with reverence  .
the zune software is super speedy , visually pleasing , and well integrated into windows 7 with jump lists to your favorite artists , and a mini taskbar player that is perfect  .
give the zune software a try and you will probably never want to play your music in itunes ever again  .
even if you don't spring for the zune pass the ability to have the software dynamically create playlists out of the standard 30 second previews is nice  .
hey maybe you just want to listen to a 30 second per song rundown of all the top songs on the billboard charts or play a playlist of the top 100 songs from 1991 without having to listen to each song in it's entirety ; in that case zune pass not needed there are also a ton of community features built into zune as well  .
if you have xbox live you will immediately be familiar with the zune cards which show your friends and what songs and albums they've been listening to  .
you can send these people songs , check out what they listen to and download anything they've listened to if you have a zune pass  .
the zune software automatically shows you all the people on your xbox live friends list and what they've been listening to on zune there's so much more to say , i have not even talked about video  .
the marketplace lets you rent and purchase standard definition and high definition movies and tv shows  .
the zune hd w/ it's proper 16  9 oled display will display videos w/out letterboxing  .
in november xbox 360 will connect to the zune video store and anything you purchase on pc/zune/360 will be free to download on all devices linked to your account .
the device has an awesome form factor and seems to fit perfectly in your hand  .
this is an awesome device for anyone that is not already tied down to much by apple , those people will pick at things like having no speaker , something that i have never even cared about  .
the metal finish on the back feels awesome in your hand and is pretty difficult to scratch the zune firmware on the device is blazin fast  .
i am still amazed by how fast everything loads with the nvidia tegra processor  .
i am still stunned by how awesome it looks , flipping through the menu's is fun for me for an unexplainable reason  .
i don't know if its how fast the response is or the look and feel , but i love it  .
the history and new features on the menu are an easy way to listen to music without searching through the menus to find what you want  .
you are also able to pin music to that menu so you can find what you want quickly some of the new features are a lot of fun especially when integrated with zune pass  .
i love the new social features that let you look at the songs your friends have been listening to , and their favorites and download them if you want  .
hd radio is also really enjoyable to listen to , and i hate the radio , but it sounds so amazing on this device i actually listen to it  .
the tagging features integrated with the radios metadata are really fun if you are paying for rhapsody right now , pick one of these up and switch to zune pass  .
if you are not sure about zune pass i can say it is 100% worth it , you get to download unlimited songs and get to keep 10 of those  .
with features in zune like channels the zune pass becomes even more worth it  .
zune has channels which they update with new songs every week or maybe a little more , it is an awesome way to listen to new music that you would not have heard otherwise the zune software is really nice and intuitive  .
it has a new smart dj feature that lets you hit that on an album or artist and it will do like a pandora sort of thing  .
where it plays music that is similar sounding to what you choose , and with zune pass it will also integrate songs from zune marketplace to go along with the playlist overall i am going to have to say that the zune hd is probably the best ipod alternative on the market and definitely gives the ipod touch a run for the money in the eyes of consumers .
this device is amazing  .
the zune 4  .
0 software is fast compared to itunes 9  .
i never saw myself getting a zune , but a zune with a zune pass is an amazing combination .
for 15/month you can download as much music as you want and keep 10 songs  .
great player and cheaper than itouch  .
i think its an awesome deal .
it's a great player for a great price  .
i'm amazed at the large/bright screen with 3d menus and high quality video yet it's lightweight and long battery life the zune hd has the best interface for browsing a large library of music  .
there's not much of a manual but you do not need it  .
it makes perfect sense .
i've been waiting for the zune for two months and could not be more pleased now that i have the device  .
it's a cool , sleek device that's come a long way  .
the music and audio are very , very good  .
it's quite a concession to the quality of the zune if a main remaining difference with the ipod is the apps    as i had an apple rep in a best buy tell me yesterday  .
he said he had only five or six apps on his ipod    hardly a key differentiator to me a few more apps , a few more games , larger music selection come on microsoft , i have bigger plans for my zune hd , make it happen .
it is worth buying  .
over all i am really impressed by the zune hd  .
i've had many ipods , as well as an iphone and nothing apple currently has beats this  .
microsoft planned the ui out very well  .
i especially like the favorites section and the pinned section  .
the zune software 4  .
0 is amazing compared to itunes  .
it not only looks good , but has great functionality  .
there are little things that you can do with it that itunes cannot  .
its just something you have to experience for yourself  .
also the zune pass  .
once you get passed the fact that your borrowing the music it's probably one of the best things you can get  .
just look at it like this with netflix you are paying a subscription to rent dvds  .
it's the same thing except with music and the fact that you get 6million songs as long as you keep the subscription current is well worth it  .
i find it much easier to be legal and pay $15 a month and have good quality music , the ability to have channels (an automatically updated playlist that adds the newest tracks) , a lot easier then trying to find torrents/download   files from limewire  .
anyways thats just my 2cents  .
if your thinking about buying a zune hd then do it  .
you seriously wont be disappointed .
zune hd , missed an opportunity without speaker app store  .
i've owned zunes from each generation (first the 30gb , then the 80 and 120 , and now the hd) , and they've all been solid , capable players with a good set of features that stand up to any competitor out there  .
with the zune hd a certain level of flair has been added that has been missing before , with a beautiful oled screen , a slick and capable ui with some interesting features like the ability to 'pin' commonly used features to the front , and hd radio the player is on the lighter side , and may be smaller than you think if you've only seen it in photos by itself  .
it's very light and smaller than equivalent ipods , but the screen packs almost as much resolution as those larger players  .
despite that , it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy the ui and player's design aesthetic is definitely different from the ipod , more angular for the player , and a much busier ui that nevertheless doesn't feel cluttered or cramped  .
large bold fonts that don't always fit the screen feel right because the ui does a great job of having them fly in and out to be legible while given a certain level of style that past zunes have lacked  .
it's the kind of thing you have to see in person to appreciate the expected tight integration with their 'marketplace' software is as expected , with some nice capabilities others lack like wireless syncing with your pc , as well as the ability to stream and/or download subscription music wirelessly if within wifi range the subscription service , zune pass , is a key differentiator for me that led me to choose the zune ecosystem instead of apple's itunes/ipod  .
ipods and itunes are undeniably well designed , and work very well for most people however , as someone who likes to listen to a wide variety of music and enjoys finding new artists to listen to and appreciate , having the subscription service is a killer feature  .
for $15 a month you can download 10 mp3 songs to keep , and the other $5 goes towards the ability to stream and/or download from a huge selection of millions of songs  .
unlike pandora , lastfm , or other services you also have exact control over what you listen to , and when many people seem to thinking buying or renting music is an either/or option , but if you can afford the extra $5 a month , then you can both buy your favorite songs above and beyond the 10 per month provided , and enjoy the subscription music  .
it's a great combo , and is the primary feature that lead me to pick zunes over ipods without a look back the marketplace software itself is a worthy contender to itunes , with a well    designed ui that has lots of slick features like 'mixview' to quickly see related artists and/or zune users who are also fans of the artist , and also a surprisingly good smart dj feature that seems finally to actually work well and be of use , as opposed to past attempts  .
inspired by rhapsody's channels (which came before apple's genius feature , and are similar in nature) , the smart dj will instantly make a playlist from both your collection's music as well as music available via zune pass if you have it  .
this gives you a great way to mix in your favorites with new music discovery and i'm already having lots of fun with it video and audio podcasts are available , as is a good selection of tv show episodes and movies available for both rental or purchase in most cases , in both standard and hd formats the built in web browser is surprisingly good too  .
this is not too important to me , as i already have an iphone , but it's good to have for fallback  .
it's not as polished as safari on the ipod touch , but it came much closer than i thought it would in larger metropolitan areas like boston the hd radio can also be an excellent feature  .
the sound quality is not hugely better than regular fm in my opinion , but what is wonderful is that you have access to additional streams for each hd radio station  .
for example wgbh has 3 hd signals , so if you don't like what they're playing on one of them , try the other two the app store is the one feature that is no match for its ipod equivalent  .
there's a rather sad selection of a handful of apps at the moment , and is in no way currently a competitor to the vast and enjoyable apple app store  .
who knows what will come with time , but this certainly wo not change anytime in the near future  .
if apps and/or internet browsing is a key feature for you , then an ipod touch may still be your best choice but , if you are primarily concerned with using this player for music and video , then it's unique features make it something very much worth considering , with a unique and enjoyable combination of features and options that no other player has .
this is a must if you love music the zune software is the best , this is the best pmp hands down btw i have had ipods , fyi the zune wo not work on macs sorry   \  .
i cannot review it because i do not own it  .
cnet should disable the review option until a product is for sale  .
no one here has written a review because none of them actually own the device , therefor they're not reviews .
i forgot to mention the hd radio tuner the only media device with one  .
its certainly in a class by itself and something that people like myself would expect to see from the next zune  .
it is definetily unique , it's better than the itouch imo but the zune has features the itouch doesn't have and can not do  .
i really do not know what to do sell my psp or buy the pspgo , zunehd , itouch or ps3 slim or maybe i'll just buy them all eventually lol  .
looking forward on the release .
i have always had issues with apple products  .
they just have never seemed to work with me  .
i like the idea of apple but i see zune as a far superior product  .
yes , you dont get as many apps with zune (so far) but i dont really use apps that much anyway  .
sure , there is not a camera on the new zune , but i take my camera most places i go anyway and if i need a real camera , ill break out my sony  .
a 2 megapixel camera is going to give you garbage images for the most part anyway bottom line , ive always been a strong zune supporter and still use my 30 gb to this day  .
ive dropped it at least 50 times on all sorts of surfaces from gravel , to concrete to treadmills to hard wood floors and it still works  .
my sister dropped her ipod on her bed and it froze up and stopped working  .
itunes has an edge on zune as far as content , but i prefer to use the zune collection interface for managing my music rather than itunes  .
itunes is very unorganized and does not display as well as the zune bottom line , the zune hd looks great and i cant wait to see how long the battery actually lasts on a full charge  .
without holding it in my hands and purely looking at many editor reviews as well as fan reviews i would give this product a 9/10 in box  .
it very well could be a 10/10  .
when they make a zune 80 gb touch it will be the most complete mp3 player in my opinion .
zune hd has so many more options , and overall kicks the living   out of iphone and over stands anything and everything mac has to try to top it .
best pmp out there .
i want it but need a larger capacity  .
this item is amazing it looks great from what i can tell the touch screen looks sensitive the only thing i would change is make the screen a little shorter and wider  .
other than that i am excited about it  .
ill buy it right away  .
hello microsoft , if the specs are not final , i recommend adding at least a 2mp camera , bluetooth and backwards compatible with older zunes  .
im no marketing guru but i think those things will help grab apple marketshare .
cant wait  .
microsoft needs to just release this  .
i'm getting tired of waiting  .
i use ipod touch 1g more than 1 , 5 years  .
will be dictionaries , icq , jabber , internet radio , vnc and good games  .
i have them on my ipod touch 2  .
i currently own a 2nd generation ipod touch  .
youtube is already an application on it there is definitely no need to make it available on the web browser  .
as far as i'm concerned the samsung p3 has a different online video application , and the others i don't really know , nor really care about  .
if the zune hd puts out what is expected of it , competing with the ipod touch , i'll consider buying it  .
now , as for the ipod touch , the third gen model might suddenly leave the zune hd in the dust at announcement if there will be an ipod touch 3g  .
considering what all of apple's done so far to the iphone , i don't doubt it  .
getting back to the zune hd , the main menu and a multi    touch interface might be worth it compared to a 4x5 grid of about 180 total programs , plus a search interface  .
hopefully , microsoft does more of its homework before releasing it i really do not want the same headache that i got with my first zune and with windows vista seeing that it is sort of rushed out the door  .
now i'm going to watch the cnet zune hd prototype review maybe that'll quell my excitement .
looks alright now but if it turns out that the ipod is better than i'll get a ipod and i'm not very much of a ipod fan .
just such an excellent product  .
updated  .
on jun 30 , 2009  .
get it this summer  .
updated  .
on sep 18 , 2009  .
better lookin then los ipos .
i am really excited about the possibility of a really functional network between my xbox 360 and the zune as far as sharing downloaded content  .
i think the zune interface is far , far , far better than ipod and much easier to develop content for  .
imo zune is fabulous for watching movies and i cannot wait to see how they look on the oled with the increased screen real estate .
i have been lucky enough to be a zune lover since december 2006  .
i am still on my original model and like timex , it takes a lickin' and still keeps tickin' (playing)  .
during that time , a friend has gone through three ipod's that continue to break and crash their hard    drive  .
i could not be more excited about both the touch    screen capability and the internet option ; this will bring zune from 2000 and late into 2000 and 8 well , 2000 and 9 , to be exact  .
i absolutely refuse to pay  .
99 cents for songs that i listen to and am bored by in one months time  .
in this economy , i cannot understand why the $14  .
99/month zune pass is not on everyone's list of how to save money  .
my 30gb zune is crammed to the max and every couple of weeks i dump the contents and download another 30gb's of new music all for the same price  .
please microsoft make this zune model a winner and stiff competitor to the blackhole of ipod land  .
i have not owned this product so i cannot review it  .
cnet do not us review products until they are actually on the market  .
i have an iphone , and i looooooove it  .
i would never think of getting anything else  .
but , devices like this force competition , and innovation , maybe apple will but a radio tuner in now (lol) to compete with a hd tuner  .
my gf is looking at a touch , i told her to wait till this thing comes out  .
it will be a tough climb to compete with the app store , but microsoft has proven it can do that (xbox)  .
best of luck .
its awesome  .
i hate when people say ipod killer its making it seems like ipod is superior but yet it isnt just has really stupid consumers  .
if there wasnt a zune i would go with something with blu tooth i just see the ipod as a second rate joke that is sold cause of the name i really dont care if zune owns 4% of the market place im a proud zune owner and would never touch an ipod updated  .
on may 30 , 2009  .
i want some alternative to ipod because everybody got ipod even me but i want something different that not everyone got one and this is the product  .
i got the samsung p3 and cowon s9 but this one is the combination of both plus the sony x    1000  .
get one .
wow  .
i love this  .
there's only a few things i would change    maybe more apps  .
i mean , i don't need them , but for competition with the ipod touch i would like an app where you can write things down that you can remember , like the notes on the ipod touch    ok , i read somewhere that the zune is capable of having a 9 megapixel camera on it  .
why not  .
thats more of a want though    kind of loads slow  .
i have no experience with itunes , but zune software could be a tad bit faster    maybe a up and down volume so you do not have to look at it  .
oh i just decided i want something like the nike thing with apple  .
adidas , step it up  .
that's it  .
here's what i love    hd radio    sexiness    weight  .
quickplay  .
free apps    may i add that microsoft got rid of their commercials  .
i love the pgr racing , i lent it to a guy on the bus , an ipod lover , in fact , and he gave it back to me , proclaiming her zune makes your ipods suck  .
gosh , the list goes on and on  .
well , they also have the 64 gb now for those major music people , and the customizable backplates are cool , even though i like the aluminum silver backplates  .
personally , the black one on the 16 gb are kinda ugly  .
oh yeah did i mention the sound is amazing even with the sucky headphones  .
conclusion   the zune hd is competition that apple should look out for  .
if microsoft can go from something people call a brick to this , sleek , beauty machine , what might they come out with in another 4 years  .
over all its a great product meant for those who like music but dont really care about the apps would rather just listen and enjoy  .
i like the style and feel of the zune hd  .
the 32gb has more than enough space for my needs (so far)  .
i like that it supports several music and video formats , and the accessories (for the most part) are reasonably priced  .
tv video playback is great .
the zune hd is a great buy if like i said befor you love to listin to music and watch t  .
etc  .
if you have a craving for games and apps get an ipod or a psp  .
this product is still young and it has a few things that need to be worked out and microsoft has been taking care of most of them through updates and more and more apps having been coming out but it is still limted  .
but it comes down to this buying a zunehd comes down to you over what you want to do with it  .
i is very impressed with the zune hd  .
microsoft really seems to be doing everything it should to get the zune where it needs to be to compete with the ipod  .
the zune software is much improved from it's bug    filled yesteryear  .
the only reason i did not give it a 5 star rating is because of zune marketplace  .
you still need to buy microsoft points to buy songs and videos  .
however , you can sync music from any source (itunes , cd , etc  .
) as long as it does not have drm .
the zune sets itself apart from the others by combining everything that you could possibly want to know about your favorite artists into a seamless interface ; the optional zune pass ($15/month       includes 10 drm    free downloads each month) is cheaper than other music subcription services and only further enhances the experience , allowing you to further explore music on    the    fly , even streaming entire albums when wifi is available (would be amazing in a zune phone) the interface and the display are incredible for the most part , aside from the minor annoyance of having to press a button then tap the screen to pause or play       pretty much an oversight on all touch screen devices (there has to be a balance , come on)  .
images are crisp thanks to the oled  .
graphics in games (however few there may be) rival that of dedicated portable game systems thanks to the tegra chip       astounding and , yes , the quality of video and audio is astounding  .
downloads from the store are mostly drm    free mp3 , with some wma , and have been at high quality (320kbps)  .
most from itunes are 128kbps , for comparison i could go on , but i've already wasted enough time  .
so       its great overall , just lacking in regards to apps  .
if you're buying a music player for apps and cannot wait for future development , the zune may not be for you  .
but if you're an audiophile that loves exploring music and artists , and appreciate interfaces that can pass as art themselves , get a zune hd .
i really appreciate the usability of the zune hd for music and movies  .
using the zune hd in a car is a little frustrating as it takes 2    3 touches to get a next or previous song including possibly a top button click , definitely a side    button click , and a touch screen click  .
the zune  .
net service makes it very worthwhile  .
i is spending $20/month on emusic  .
com over the past 3 years and getting ~40 tracks to keep , many of which were not worth keeping  .
now i spend $14  .
99/month and get to keep 10 tracks forever , plus unlimited tracks as long as i continue subscription .
let me start by saying the ipod touch is not a bad device by any means  .
it just doesn't quite have the appeal zunehd offers when you first unbox this pmp , you're greeted by gorgeous brushed aluminum and a large screen you know beckoning you to touch it  .
power it up and you'll be greeted by a bright and colorful video , which is sure to instantly satisfy even the most critical of eyes the zunehd , as the name implies , is designed with video in mind  .
on that front , micrsoft delivers one of the best portable video devices around  .
the 3  .
3 oled screen is almost unrivaled in picture quality , putting the more popular ipod touch to shame (my brother has a touch , and he wants to know if he can trade it in for a zune)  .
it offers a greater color range than the competition , and is complemented nicely by the optional hdmi    packing dock thanks to it's tegra chip by nvidia , this visual feast for the eyes doesn't end there (or anytime soon , with it's 8 hour battery life on video playback)  .
the inclusion of this new processor allows for some pretty impressive gaming potential in this little handheld  .
though games (and other apps) are few for the time being , the ones that are available do not disappoint  .
audiosurf , for example , delivers an great way to really get into your music , and should you happen to stop the game accidentally (or on purpose) , the music continues to play uninterrupted  .
if you've got a zunehd , do yourself a favor and download this app the interface features large print , is quite responsive , and very easy to navigate  .
find music or videos is a snap , allowing users to start a movie , playlist , or album with a single tap  .
playback on a video already in progress will pick up where you last left off , unless you choose to restart as mentioned , the new hotness does deliver phenomenal battery life  .
8 hours of video playback (with wi    fi disabled and screen brightness on medium) and 32+ hours of audio (same settings + eq enabled) is sure to satisfy on long trips or long days at work , er , home a media player is nothing without the software to back it up , and the redesigned zune software definitely is nice  .
syncing is a snap , and can even be done over wi    fi  .
zune pass delivers unlimited music from a tremendous music library for $15 a month , and includes 10 permanent downloads per month  .
you can access the zune store directly from the device via wi    fi and watch your library expand like never before hd radio is an improvement over previous generations' plain ol' fm tuners  .
track information beams straight to the device from available stations and can be tagged for download later  .
team this up with zune pass and the possibilities are endless now , i did list a few cons here , but most are minor and probably do not affect too many users , the exception being the web browser  .
flash support for hulu and youtube would've made this a perfect pmp  .
though , it should be mentioned that the on    screen keyboard is very friendly to those of us with slightly larger digits there are only a few apps available for the zunehd , but they are free , and i cannot complain much about that it may not have the wide format support found on player's like the s9 , but the formats it does support are common enough to not be a huge problem (cnet's download site does have quite a few free video converters to get you the format you need)  .
also , with the announcement of xvid support coming soon , more and more people are sure to be satisfied all in all , i'm highly satisfied with the zunehd and glad i shelled out the $289 for it  .
with its mindblowingly impressive screen , incredible battery life , and near    endless supply of music , it's almost the perfect means of portable entertainment  .
an improved browser with flash support , or at least some more apps and games , would definitely put the zunehd above the competition should anyone from microsoft come across this , take some advice  .
the xbox 360's got netflix , and works rather well with the zune marketplace  .
how about cutting a deal and working on an app for netflix  .
or , how about some of the more popular arcade hits for this handheld beauty  .
i'd even gladly pay for geometry wars and castle crashers on this device  .
come on , you know you would , too (free would be a very nice price)  .
i'll settle for tetris  .
my primary device is the 80gb 2nd gen zune , but is considering upgrading to the zune hd  .
i tried it out in stores and absolutely love it  .
it is what i crave , a media centric mp3 player  .
but 32gb is not enough for all my music and video  .
it needs to be at least 80gb , so until then i'll stick to my 2nd gen zune , which is still working perfectly  .
and the majority of my video files are  .
avi , so i'm still annoyed that it doesn't support that format  .
i also have a few  .
ogg and  .
flac audio files , which the zune does not support .
i am very glad i switched from ipod to zune  .
i have had two ipods die and have recieved replacements as gifts after the lasto one i decided to change and now am a zune user  .
i am no zune fanboy , i have been very disappointed with microsoft for the time being , between vista and the drop of ace , the zune is the only thing really holding me to windows , i am sick of being in an ipod world , and i wanted to stand out , so i bought a 30gb v1 , and that is i is hooked , the screen is as big as the ipod it self  .
i got a zune hd because after many years my 30 gb is on its last leg , and pretty much i have not been able to put it down , its a fun device , and even the most die hard ipod fans love it and cannot keep there hands off of it  .
but i went in to frys the other day looking for something for it and i went up to a guy and asked were i could find a case for it , and the guys said what is it and i had to explain to him what it is and let him play with it and he loved it and said why have i never heard of this before and we went over to the zune booth and there nothing there , they don't one you can play with like the touch  .
microsofts not really marketing this at all , and its a shame  .
but back to the zune hd , its pretty much everything i wanted , it has a few bugs like not having flash or no able to log in to an enterprise network that needs a user name and pass work  .
the zune is just a joy to use , there not many apps but the few they have are really good quality and it would rather have that over 150 , 000 , i don't need or want , a gun app , or a lightsaber app , or a lighter app  .
i don't want or need 1000's of useless apps so it is not a apps device , it is a media device and it does what you would want it to do , music play back is flawless , video is crisp and clear , hd radio is amazing (now if only clearchannel didn't own all the stations)  .
gaming on its flawless and fun , pgr just blows every racing app for the touch out of the water , and audiosurf you just cannot beat it  .
the zune software and the zune pass just are cherry on top  .
now this is all based on if you want a media player if you want something that cannot lay flat on a table or something that has 150 , 000 apps , or something that doesn't have radio this is not the device for you , if you want something that does not have internet or can count your steps or takes video with a 2  .
5 megapixal camera this is not for you  .
and if you own a mac this is not for you the only reason i gave it a 4 1/2 is because microsoft's lack in keeping people with the device really 89th in sales and ipods were in 2nd place  .
make the apps and get flash and i bet you then can compeat with the apple empire .
the zune hd is a companion , not a surrogate playmate or time waster  .
it , like many other microsoft products serves a distinct function  .
the function in this case is to provide entertainment or the background music to your life  .
i do enjoy the apps , but i will be honest , they are not the reason i bought the zune hd  .
if you want to hear music anywhere , this is for you  .
if you want a media center you can take with you , this is for you (provided you buy the av dock/recharger)  .
you can shop for apps , share music , join the social , sync content wirelessly  .
s a great device .
the zune hd , first and foremost , is still a media player , not a pda , like the ipod touch is therefore , it should be treated as a media    centric device , not a do    it    all wonder like the touch the zune hd's ui is incredibly fast and pretty , and i prefer the hd's list based ui rather than the touch's icon    based one  .
yes , i do know that a great number of people prefer the icon    based ui's of the touch , s9 , walkman x , and p3 , but ui's all come down to personal preference and what they can do for you the oled screen of the hd is incredible ; pictures and videos of it don't do it justice , this is just something that has to be seen in person as i stated up before , the build quality of the tactile buttons is variable on the hd ; some people have said the buttons are too tight , while others have said they are too loose  .
on mine , the home button is perfect , while the media button is way too loose  .
other than that , however , the build quality on this thing is flawless the zune software , i've found , is faster and more attractive than the current build of itunes 9  .
device connectivity as well seems a bit better too the build of iem 6  .
5 that the zune hd comes with is great in terms of brute force rendering (html and the like) , but falls flat on its face when it comes to javascript  .
it's also lacking a bunch of core features that mobile safari has as well , like browser history , a forward button , and tabbed browsing  .
however , since i am only talking about pmp's here (and not cell phones) , the zune hd and the ipod touch are currently the best in the pmp field , as the walkman's browser is just horrendous while the s9 does not even have one sound    quality wise , i have no idea  .
i'm not an audiophile , nor do i claim to be one  .
it really depends on the person and the quality of the earphones one is using to determine which player sounds better the applications selection is quite a bit lacking  .
twitter has come out and facebook looks to come out in january , but apart from those , there really is not anything  .
an enterprise app would be most useful the nvidia tegra apx2600 chip has an 800mhz arm11 cpu and an extremely light    weight geforce gpu , in addition to processing units devoted to other tasks , like video rendering  .
for pgr and audiosurf , the graphics are very good , and the controls work well (for the most part) bottom line , i cannot really recommend this player to just anyone ; in fact , i would wholly recommend actually going out to a store that has the media players that you're interested in (ipod touch , zune hd , cowon s9 , samsung p3 , sansa fuze , walkman x , etc  .
) and physically try them out , instead of looking down spec sheets while people might just opt for the lazy route and just buy an ipod touch , i would recommend researching your options and scan the internet and ask questions about the players and be aware of the numerous options one has when buying a pmp .
does this have an msn app  .
and if not can it use internet msn websites such as iloveim  .
com  .
although not a i    touch killer , its an all around better alternative if your needs are mainly on music , video , and pictures  .
plus it's easier to use once you get the hang of it .
i really love my zune .
a very complete player  .
compared to my iphone , it's is much better as a media device in that it looks better for video , sounds better for audio , and has a much cleaner (read   less tile like) user interface  .
the supporting zune software is so much better than itunes its not even funny  .
integrated seamlessly with my windows media center dvr so i can very easily move content to the player if you have not tried out the iphone / touch , give it a try first and then take a look at the zune  .
the apps will catch up i'm sure  .
who needs to browse all the fart apps in the itunes store  .
there is such a dearth of useless applications for the iphone that it makes it hard to find good ones  .
i am hoping that the ms store will be a bit more controlled  .
the apps that are there for the zune are actually pretty good if you are looking for a device that will make you look cool , go with the touch  .
if you are serious about your media and want most of the application potential , go with the zune  .
i have both and will not use my iphone for anything but a phone from now on updated  .
on apr 19 , 2010  .
i really enjoy my zune hd  .
the zune folks have created a player that is focused on music  .
it is small but not too small to have a functional screen  .
the touch screen is brilliant , very responsive and smooth  .
the smart dj function is great , especially with zune pass and has introduced me to a lot of new music  .
the sound quality is very good once you upgrade the earphones (i'm never happy with the earphones included with music players)  .
i really like the zune software and find it easy to use and attractive in design  .
the hd radio works well and being able to tag songs for download is great  .
with my existing music collection , hd radio and zune pass there is always something fun to listen to  .
the internet browser works but i don't like surfing on such small devices  .
there are few apps but nothing to get excited about  .
because the zune's track controls are on the touch screen changing songs without looking at the player can take some practice i also have the ipod touch and would says that if you want games , apps and pda features touch is the better choice  .
however if you want to listen to music the zune provides a better experience ps    i also have to say i do not own a mac but on my pc the touch and itunes does strange things   it says it synchs but then sometimes the songs are not on the player , it changes the genre of my music files and it often cannot find album art  .
i've not experienced any glitches with the zune .
this is my first review , so forgive me if it's not that great , i will be comparing the ipod touch to the zune hd , it may sound biased , but i can assure you , i am as unbiased as they come , i will however say i am getting the ipod touch over the zune hd for the sole purpose that ipod touch is mac , nothing else , not even the app store anyways zune hd's screen vs ipod touch screen , indoors , the oled screen of a zune hd is a dream , it's absolutely gorgeous , colors are vivd and it is ideal for watching movies , as well as making the device thinner with better battery life , it defeats the ipod touches screen in nearly every way except for the fact that in direct sunlight , it doesn't do very well , the ipod touch defeats the zune hd in that respect battery life , the zune hd destroys the ipod touch 3rd gen in every way here apps , no contest , i'm sorry , even if the zune hd may get an app store soon , i am discussing the here and now , the ipod touch crushes the zune hd over here , it is the biggest selling point for the ipod touch over a zune weight , looks , ui   in weight and looks , zune hd wins , however the ui of the ipod touch , although not as pretty , is more user friendly (as long as you recognize icons   p) , especiially for apps , you can also have multiple pages with the ipod touch , unlike the zune hd music service   i use itunes , but i never actually buy music from there , cause , if you read above , i have a mac , so   p , but in all respects , i've never really used the zune services , so i won't talk about which one is better or easier , imo , as long as you're not too technologically impaired , they're both likely about equally as easy after playing around with them for an hour , seriously , it's not hard to use these services , people are always talking about how complex itunes is and the only thing i can think about is reeaaally  .
anyways , zune pass is a big plus over itunes and just a wonderful way to discover new music and have all the music you ever wanted at your fingertips , with all the pretty album artwork and organized names and albums and all , plus keeping 10 songs all for yourself a month  .
itunes needs to catch up , cause , wow , awesome zune hd's accelerometer is faster , no doubt , but i'd say when it comes to clicking stuff like music and movies and pictures , the screens load up just as fast , the new ipod touch has very impressive speed browser   the browser on the zune hd is a big step above the ie browser in windows mobile , but compared to safari , it is , noticeably , not as fast , and lacks many basic features , as well as the touch keyboard being ridiculously small compared to the ipod touches the touch screen   most people think they're equal , however if you've ever scrolled through music on an ipod touch and a zune hd , you may not have noticed , but the ipod touches is more responsive , however the zune hd fixes this with a feature that allows you to find music based on the 'abc' letter that it starts with , however sometimes your fingers click a song instead of the button that takes you to the 'abc' feature (sorry , you'll know what i'm talking about if you have a zune hd or watched some videos on it   p) , or vice versa customization   zune wins  .
zune originals and 3 lines of text , over ipod touches lack of zune originals and 2 lines of text sound quality   zune hd wins , hands down price   entry level touch is cheaper then the zune hd but half the memory , 8gb touch for $199 and 16gb zune hd for $219 , however the 32gb zune hd is $10 cheaper then the 32gb ipod touch ($300) now , things that the touch has that the zune lacks awesome app store speaker (big thumbs up) windows and mac compatible 64gb availability voice over (totally awesome)  .
voice memos , yada yada , you know this stuff , all the crap that the iphone os comes with international availability what the zune hd has that the ipod touch doesn't hd radio (excellent radio , tells you what songs you're listening to as well as giving you a way of saving that song for a later download) zune originals oled screen hd output (requires a $90 dock though , thumbs down)  .
movie rentals i've gone through all the points i could think of , i apologize if i missed anything , if you would like my bottom line , here it is (it's not going to be original)    .
the zune hd is an amazing media player , it's sound quality is superb , it has so many music features as well as great new ways to discover music , an amazing screen and everything about it is just awesome (except that it lacks a speaker   /) , it is the music player of the year , and if you don't care about games and all , it is for you , it's just perfect for everything music , as well as movies , with that gorgeous screen however , if you want an all in one device , i'm sorry zune lovers , the ipod touch wins , the app store is the only reason (speaker is also an advantage for people like me) , you wo not find the media playback as good , , nor will the screen be as nice , but overall , it is an excellent all in one device  .
i bought the zune hd 32 gb to replace my well    used sansa fuze 8gb (+8 gb microsd)  .
so far , it excels in everyway but two  .
first , my fuze would take a multi    track audiobook and treat it as an audiobook , i  .
, remember where i is after i shut down , and restart at the right point , even when i used the player to listen to music in the interim  .
the fuze would treat anything tagged audiobook this way , but the best the zune hd will do is allow autobookmarking with podcasts  .
now if i hav an audiobook in mp3 format with 100+ tracks , i have to join all those tracks into one long track , then change the metadata to podcast in genre , and then the zune will auto    bookmark for me  .
otherwise , i'm either fast    forwarding to the space i just left , or i have to remember which of the 100+ tracks i last listened to  .
so there's a workaround , but it's not straightforward  .
i also moved to zune from rhapsody's service , and when i searched zune before joining , i found many more albums in the marketplace than are actually there  .
so if you haven't joined the zune marketplace , but you're searching their catalog to see what they have , beware  .
the search results returned exaggerate what's really available through zunepass  .
it's roughly comparable to rhapsody , but there are some things i had access to through my rhapsody to go account that aren't part of the zunepass now the good    this player is incredible  .
i love the size    i can run with this thing , but also watch video on it  .
the screen is very clear , and the layout is easy to navigate  .
my ipod obsessed 9 year old is now saving all her allowance for a zune hd  .
since i buy mp3 players for their functionality and not style , this tells me that it is also stylish  .
my wife only wants easy to use tech , and she likes the zune hd a lot  .
i love how well integrated my collection is with the software  .
if i rip a new cd to my computer , the zune software recognizes it quickly , and i can easily move it from my collection to my zune hd in the software  .
one of the problems with rhapsody is that it often auto    updated my playlists to both the internal memory and the external microsd card  .
plus , when i loaded a playlist on the fuze , it added the songs to the player , even if they were already loaded on the player  .
the zune at least recognizes that i already have a copy of a song on the player , so it does not try to load it twice podcasts are also nicely integrated  .
you get a podcast page in the software that includes a list of all podcasts in the left pane , and a list of episodes in the middle  .
you can drag (within the zune software) and drop any episodes you want the search function in the software works well too    you just search for whatever you want , and it returns artists , albums , songs , etc  .
, separated by collection/marketplace/device  .
this beats rhapsody , which requires that you search by either artist , or song , or album , instead of all three i love that i can produce multiple plalylists on my zune hd , whereas my fuze allowed one only  .
plus , the fuze is more difficult to navigate , and harder to update  .
in the zune software , you have an update option built right in i also like that apps are free right now  .
i downloaded all but one of them , and the games are fine , but nothing exceptional  .
i use the msn weather app pretty regularly , and it connects to my home wifi network quite quickly (3    4 seconds) connections to other wifi networks are more spotty  .
at work i can get on in 5    10 seconds , and at other unknown spots (like coffeehouses) it might take 30 seconds or more to get onto a wifi network (unsecured)  .
but the web browser is useful , and it can be very quick , depending on the network and your connection to it so overall , this is a slick and amazing player  .
i'm really happy with it , and it clearly has potential for even more  .
i think it's a great purchase  .
microsoft did an outstanding job with this media device  .
it is far sleeker than my ipod touch  .
having used an ipod touch , the interface and the features on the zune are far better  .
you get impressive features on the zune  .
hd radio sounds great  .
oled screen is fantastic  .
the device is extremely light and very well built  .
battery life is great as well i've been using zune 4  .
0 software all day and the changes and the updates are very good  .
zune software blows away itunes  .
it is much sleeker and is not a processor hog the great thing about the zune marketplace is for $15 a month you can download unlimited music to keep for as long as you have the service  .
plus you get to keep 10 songs a month of your choice , and you can share the same subscription with up to 3 zunes  .
that is fantastic for a family  .
i bought a zune for my daughter as well and it's great that we can both download unlimited music for only $15 a month  .
she downloads hundreds of songs a month , that would cost a fortune with the ipod , but not with the zune marketplace  .
sure you only get to keep 10 a month , but most people get sick of songs fairly quickly  .
and if you keep your subscription that will never be a problem  .
so with keeping 10 songs a month that means you're only paying $5 a month for unlimited music  .
fantastic the oled display is so crisp and beautiful  .
pictures don't do it justice  .
it is extremely responsive , far nicer than my ipod touch right now there are about 11 apps in the zune marketplace and they are all free (included with the subscription) which is great i have no complaints about this device  .
i purchased it with the dock , and man does the picture look great on my tv  .
the zune outputs videos without any problems or hesitation  .
truly a great device  .
i highly recommend and definitely recommend that you play around with it for yourself , because pictures truly do not do it justice .
the zune hd is a new item by ms and yes , even though my cons is apps/flash i know that ms is working on bringing it to the zune hd (it is adobe that is the hold up really legal stuff etc etc)  .
and fo rthe apps , really how many of apple apps are really usefull just a hand full  .
rather have ms take their time and release real usable apps than apps that do nothing  .
also i am glad it did not come with a phone or camera , this really i think makes the battery life last alot longer  .
plus if you want all that then by a apple product , this is a ms product i think , given time , the the zune hd will be a good product to have/use (which is why i have one)  .
i cannot believe you ding the zune because of zunepass  .
you offer that up as a comparison to the total package cost versus the ipods , but then fail to even mention that an ipod without an equivalent would have no music  .
if you're going to offer up such a disingenuous comparison , at least mention that unless your buy or pirate some music , the ipods are useless as a music player  .
then do the price comparison for a legitimate ipod , not for something using stolen music .
at first i is unimpressed and is going to return it , but i played with it a little more and now i'm in love  .
it's not perfect , but what mps player is  .
the video quality really sealed the deal for me  .
it's gorgeous  .
you cannot deny it  .
it's so good that the smaller screen size didn't matter at all  .
sound quality is also very good  .
about the same as the ipod touch in my opinion  .
but the equilizer settings are awful (see above con) the user interface is very nice  .
it's cool looking and it's responsive  .
hd radio is a nice addition  .
some people don't care about radio , but like having the option  .
i wish they included am however  .
a nice feature is the song tagging from the radio  .
you can add the song you hear to the cart with the touch of a button and purchase it if you like  .
quick and simple  .
zune pass is also very nice  .
for $15 a month you get 10 free songs of your choice to keep forever and access to all the full songs in the marketplace (you don't keep those forever though)  .
i do wish i could download video directly to the zune hd  .
you can only do songs , games , and apps  .
the browser is not very good  .
maybe i just don't know how to work it properly , but it is slow and some sites i couldn't even access  .
i don't plan on using the browser much but if you like having a browser meh lastly and best of all , i heard ms is working on some games and apps that are going to make good use of that beautiful screen  .
they did not say what , but i'm sure they'll be freakin' amazing  .
this device is great  .
a few firmware updates and some time will only improve the device a lot  .
i'm not saying it's better than an ipod touch since peoples tastes in things vary updated  .

this product is amazing the best mp3 player ever (so far); not much gameings
Very responsive. Beautiful screen. Solid.; I hope Microsoft will launch Zune HD in Europe, incl. Norway.
HD radio. OLED screen. Compatibility with Xbox 360.; Current lack of apps.
- Ridiculous Battery Life. - Appealing Form Factor. - Vivid OLED Screen. - Fluid User Interface. - Rich Audio Quality. - Underrated Internet Browsing Wi-Fi; Nothing, except for the app store in its infancy
its style, its design you can get on it, and its good quality...HD!!; its Zune software on vista and mac,
Smooth sexy wifi eerything this might be an Ipod Killer; so far no cons yet but will automatically change it if i find some flaws
Clearly focused on music-lovers, offering a comparable experience to CDs and vinyl.. Gorgeous design.. Excellent UX; Low output volume when connected to speakers/amp.
HD Radio, Excellent audio quality, equalizer, OLED screen is amazing.; None at all.
OLED Screen, not small. NVIDIA Tegra! HD Radio. HDMI.; The screen is smaller than iPod touch's screen
excellent oled screen. beautiful slick interface. nvidia tegra chip. long battery life. hdmi out capable with $90 av dock. good sound quality. good format support; app store severely lacking even for a newly released one
OLED, Zune UI will work great with touch, widescreen display, rumors about connection with Xbox360, etc; Might not deliver in key areas; likely buggy 1st gen release software requiring multiple firmware/software updates; probably still no equalizer.
Design, build quality, battery life, speed, Zune Pass, etc.; App store and games really need to be expanded.
Responsive and brilliant screen, good build quality, well organized and attractive interface, good sound, lots of music options; Needs 64 GB model, remote on earbuds would be helpful
Fantastic sound quality, excellent build quality, sexy looking, wonderfully responsive screen.; The tactile switch on the side is to bring up "media options"...silly.
beautiful touch-screen display. quickplay feature. great battery life. great sound. solid build quality. menu layout is brilliant; little video and audio codec support. not enough space
size, screen is beautiful, love the UI; No power cord or any other accessories come with it, not compatible with WMP
interface is brilliant. Unique pc software for your library and music discovery. And zune pass.!; Lack of apps, currently.
OLED, HD Radio, Small, Pins, History, and Zune Pass; Only black ,and , you platinum have to buy colored Zunes from Zune.net
Fluent interface. OLED. Wifi sync. Social. Sound Quality. HD Radio. Size and Weight. Design. etc etc....; No Bluetooth. they didn't give me a free one
OLED screen, HD radio, amazing UI, fast response, great battery life; lack of a phone
Good battery life, cool music player, OLED screen, little app surprise, and the zune 4.0 software; I couldn't get mine on the first day!
OLED screen, HD Radio, download music to player, Zune pass; Nobody giving it a fair chance
I love everything!. -The sound is amazing. -Very Easy to use. -Zune software is simple and straight forward. -The OLED screen is just simply beautiful.. -The device is strudy feeling and well made; Absolutly none.
Very sexy design, definite step up from previous models, (and the itouch). Very fast, unique operating system. Love the radio. Watching movies is a joy.; If you're used to the Itouch, it takes a little while to figure out... but is definitely worth it.
I see this as an all round superior product to the Ipod Touch.; Where as this a a Much superior product to the ipod touch the one thing i would really miss is the MSN app.
Tons of storage. Amazing video and audio quality. Innovative design. Better than iTouch.; Microsoft Marketplace is a bit limited in choice of media, but has most mainstream choices.
Zune Pass. Speedy UI. Internet Browser; Its not an ipod so its no the "cool" thing to have. needs more space to hold all my music an hd videos
The Zune HD is just overall amazing. The sleek design, the long lasting battery, the awesome user interface, the OLED screen, all being run by the Tegra chip, that makes one sweet deal.; Absolutly nothing.
Brilliant OLED screen; very lightweight and small, but not TOO small; versatile video capabilities including 720p out via dock; subscription music option; fun; can sync wirelessly; smart dj feature surprisingly good; Price should be lower to boost competitiveness; on-screen only volume controls; no 64gb size available (yet)
-Screen is AMAZING. -The UI is so appealing to the eye. -All the album art/graphics. -Zune pass. -Zune software; -OLED screen doesn't look as good with direct light hitting it, but is still good and readable
Bio of artists, differ organization of music, HD radio, BATTERY LIFE a BIG ++, sharpness of video, ability to surf internet, list can go on..; Lack of Flash for browser, Setting to not accidently/confirm deleting music off zune itself, ear jack at bottom of device, Apps.
Great music experience, easy to find what you want and great experience with smart DJ and other music recomendations. Just about 15 apps, but now includes facebook, twitter, and several games, so they are good ones.; Not as many docking options as I'd like.
-Small sleek design. -Harder difficult to scratch all around. -Interface is fast intuitive &#38; pleasing to look at. -Wifi features w/ zune pass you can download new songs whenever wherever. -Browser is awesome &#38; loads everything well. -HD Radio; -Battery drains fast (about 5 or maybe a little more hours) when playing some games that use tilt feature. -No onboard speaker. -Makes my LG Dare look massive... If thats bad
great sound quality, navigation is very easy, tons of features, hd radio, zunepass integration seamless, wireless really useful, zune software excellent; mp3 audiobook support requires workaround, zune marketplace not as comprehensive as it looks from the outside
I think http://thetechnomonkey.blogspot.com/ did a much better job of telling and reviewing the pros and cons of the actual zune hd player vs the ipod touch.; http://thetechnomonkey.blogspot.com/ This is the total summary and the insight of microsoft spokesmen on the zune hd
great user interface and very responsive; need over priced dock but other companies will release accessories for lower cost so not a worry ,needs more codecs support for other formats but im sure eventually there will be a vcl for it so also not worried
(Rent music) the ability to DL an entire artist and listen instantly w/o paying any extra $$ Including stand-up COMEDY!. (Instant music) download music directly to zune w/o computer. (Web browser). (Make playlists on-the-fly) back-sync wirelessly.; (Limited apps) Because it is still a brand new item. Awwe...."tear"
the screen look amazing + a great design + hd raidio; i wish the screen was a little wider and idk about windows mobile maybe u can ............download opra mini or safari . i also wana know if the key board is good
Extraordinary video output and you have to love the Zune pass. The software was great and the new uptade makes it even better.; Lacking the apps store, Mac support and int'l coverage.
Its slim and the UI looks awesome. Touch screen thats a plus, the screen resolution 480 x 272 there goes my PSP. Web-browsing and im still curious what kinda of browser will be implemented in the ZuneHD and the 32 GB Integrated memory and the OLED.; There's no digital storage
HD Radio, Apps, Internet, movie rentals, customizable, way better looking interface than most players. PLUS the killer thing is the awsome amoled display; Only 16 and 32 gigs of space no sd card lot. no microphone not much else in cons.
Great value for money. You have a standalone product that you can watch movies from. Great for kids travelling. Can hook it up to the TV to watch HD movies - great plus. Love the WiFi. Also great device for playing games - keep kids entertained.; Wish that they had made a smaller version - although you couldn't watch video. Can't have it both ways.
Fast, Sexy, Beatiful, Lightweight, all games have been free thus far, EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY, AMAZINGLY STUNNING Video Output, Not an iPod so you can get off the bandwagon, my iPod friends love it; Media loves it but fights their love of the Zune HD because they are still riding the iPod 'met too' bandwagon
1. DJ Feature. (see http://bit.ly/info/Z6lWY for a quick tour of the Zune Software). 2. Quickplay or shortcuts. 3. Visual effects. 4. Amazing OLED screen. 5. Decent browser. 6. HD Radio. 7. ZunePass; 1. No good apps. 2. No sync with iTunes. 3. Screws. 4. Extra for dock
The HD radio, able to download Youtube videos, grat looking screen. Great MP3 player. Love the Zune media player on my computer.; Be nice if you got better headphones with the 32HD and the keypad on the facebook app could be better.
I have owned both Ipod and now Zune and out if the two, I truley believe that the Zune blows away the rest. I have been servering in Iraq for the past 7 months and when we recieved the 32GB Zune HD here it was truley amazeing.; There is nothing I don't like about the new Zune!!!!!
Video is really something. I purchased a history channel program that had cartoon graphics, old video and interviews and was really pleased with the quality of the video. Organization of music songs is nice. Audio is crisp.; If this were a phone, I'd throw my Pre in the trash.
Interface subperb-Battery life excellent-best of all it's Flashy &#38; Sexy; On my old 80 gig Zune there was a sliding button on top to proventting the swreen to change while it's in your pocket My new HD does not have this.
The clearest LCD screen I have ever seen. Tremendous sound, even using the standard headphones supplied. Super fast response to the touch. Easy to filter through music and pics. HD radio. Great Wifi; I cannot seem to download any apps, I see others are having issues but I am sure this will be fixed
Great battery life, excellent music and video player, on-screen color quality is perfect,web browser is surprisingly good for a mobile device, quick and responsive menus. Delivers exactly what it promises.; App selection has grown, but is still nowhere near the number for the itouch/iphone. Zune Marketplace needs some work.
Great screen with good video/audio quality. Great interface. Zune software also has an awesome design. It's different than everybody else's iTouch which makes me feel unique. haha.; The marketplace should be bigger which i'm hoping it will be in time. We need an SDK so that people can write apps for this. They should also make this into a phone.
Great audio playback. great third party community. open feel. If you let it sit it brings up wonderful eye candy display; has a tendency to lag out sometimes. music organization is good but not the best. only works with MS zune software
OLED Screen. Fast, responsive, slick UI. The Tegra APX2600 chip. The Zune software is a joy to use.. The industrial look is incredibly sexy.; Minimal app/game selection (as of the time of writing). The hard buttons (media button, home button) build quality is variable on the Zune HD's. Some people have complained to me that the HD's glass screen is sticky compared to the iPod Touch's.
Long Battery life (up to 33 hrs.). Ability to watch videos and play in 720p format on TV. Nice interface of features (if not confusing at first). HD Radio and Internet capabilities. Good picture viewer. Customizable. Apps capabilities (nothing right now); Smudge-tastic. Inconvenient volume control. No ability to change default black background. Hard to get songs and videos on Zune that was not bought through Zune marketplace. Internet annoying to use; features limited on browser (need to be near wifi)
Great product to have, OLED display, Zune Originals, software, simple, and cheaper than Ipod Touch when you think of memory space.; Zune Marketplace doesn't have the songs I look for and if I find than, it says they're out of stock (If anybody knows what that means).
HD Radio is really great, it will prob. hav some of the same functions as the older Zunes like wireless song sharing, the Tegra graphics card is amazing fo now it can get a 25 DAY battery life when listening to music, its just overall amazing!; NONE, ABSOLUTELY NONE
Ability to easily download music, videos, pics, and apps. Love the radio feature and the battery life is excellent!; Lack of apps compared to iPod. Zune music store and the rental of music for only a month is ridiculous. Can only connect to Internet at home.
Great screen. Fast user interface and great touch control. Great sound. Zune.net $14.99 service is fantastic for exploring new and old music.; Zune HD can't be used as a USB hard drive. Few apps. Switching computers causes mass confusion. Zune.net service needs more content. Using the Zune HD in a car is a little frustrating
1. Has a killer interface. 2. Great OLED screen. 3. Awsome software to go along with it-Zune Marketplace. 4. Intergration with Xbox LIve. 5. The all mighty Zune Pass-saves you a ton of money; 1. Limited apps - for the time being. 2. No model having a capacity over 32g - for the time being
Zune Pass changes the way you consume music. HD Radio w/tagging helps you find new music on the go. 16:9 OLED screen = video w/out letterbox. Movie rentals. Compatible w/ Xbox 360 video store. 3D games. Wi-fi sync. Battery life. Very light. Zune 4.0 software; HDMI out requires dock. Podcasts &#38; Videos are not downloadable without PC sync. Web browser is very basic. Free games include ads. No speaker. No native Mac support - Boot Camp &#38; Emulation work. Twitter app, Facebook, PGRacing, AudioSurf not until Novem
Unlike the ipod, you can put your own music on the Zune, it is sleek, light weight, and able to sinc with up to 3 computers. You can play avi files on the Zune now, and I use it all of the time.; none. I have no negatives to say
1. The OLD Screen, it looks better then my Samsung 32" HDTV. 2. The UI, its smooth and very graphic orientated.. 3. The Terga chip, videos have no lag and games have high FPS. 4. The software, the Zune software amazing and simple to use.; 1. Microsoft's lack in keeping people with the device. 2. Microsoft's slow with coming out with apps and the fixing of other bug.. 3. no flash and no silverlight.
Being the only HD media player on the market in certainly an attractive trait. I've always found the Zune software more user friendly than any player out there.; I was hoping they would have released a larger hard drive version as well DIVX support. I'm sure an app is on the way but this really should have been ready on release.
Beautiful vibrant screen. Great sound quality. HD video out. HD radio tuner. Easy intuitive interface. Battery life; Limited selection of Apps. Sometimes HD radio signal is lost and FM is picked up. Not a problem 98% of the time but sometimes there is a delay.. Web browser connectivity. No flash support as of now
The interface for the multimeda is incredible... music, videos, HD radio. Amazing!!; You're expecting me to say apps... well i just don't care about apps. I want a DMP and the Zune HD delivers x 10. If I want apps I'll buy a netbook.
Very sexy design; Video quality superior to all but 2 other PMPs (Sony and Cowon); Very user-friendly interface; Powerful Tegra chip doesn't disappoint; Amazing battery life; Zune Pass and HD Radio for seemingly endless auditory pleasure; Free apps;; Does not use a full-fledged web browser, no Flash support; limited EQ options, no customization; could offer greater format support for audio and video (XviD coming soon, though); more apps couldn't hurt;
Amazing screen, touch screen to fly through menus. HD radio and video. More games than 3rd generation Zune. Longer battery life. Very stunning in looks. Solid construction. INTERNET; something Zunes have never had. renting movies; Not as much memory as the 3rd generation 120 GB. Having a touchscreen will make you have fingerprints all over the screen, for the clean-freaks like me.. Doesnt support Youtube, etc; when you will need a flash player.
-excellent video quality, it's the best out there. -attractive user interface. -good sound quality. -hd radio with song tagging for purchase. -future apps &#38; games; -browser sucks (if you care about a web browser). -audio settings are too few and some sound just alike. -no video store in marketplace on the player, have to do it from a pc and then sync
Great sound.. Unmatched OLED screen.. Smooth video playback.. Best touch and MP3 UI on the market. Zune software is a great experience coupled with Zune Pass.; Zune software can run a little slow sometimes. Once the collection is loaded, it runs fine.. I have large hands, and can "fat finger" the touch keypad on occasion. Not bad, but a little frustrating at times.
OLED display (AMAZING), media playback, Zune interface, internet browser, HD radio, Constant artist info on your MP3 files such as bios, song, photos, which is really cool. Zune 4.0 software, ease of use. Not Mac compatible!); The Zune HD headphones are average, no flash support on websites such as YouTube (but you can download the YouTube Downloader and convert the videos into mp4 formats and store them in the Zune HD!)
It does everything the itouch does, but better. Better battery life, faster, better graphics card, HD FM radio with a bunch of extra crystal-clear channels and more. It does a lot and you will be surprised.The web browser is much better on the Zune.; Not as many apps as the Itouch.
This player not only features a much better quality OLED screen for watching video but also features great audio quality. The UI for the device and the zune 4.0 software also easily blows Itunes out of the water.; Lack of accessories when compared to the Ipod.
The OLED screen is truly brilliant when you place it next to comparable sized LCD screen such that other competitive devices carry. The Nvidia Tegra processor really shows its stuff with high frame animations and 720p video.; The app section leaves something to be desired. That is only natural with a product that is still less than a month old. If Microsoft opens up its app licensing there are many Ipod apps that have already been ported, And many more to come.
OLED screen looks amazing if not 3D. It has HD Video. Music sounds great. Future potential with hardware. HD Radio. Battery lasts, well, all day (And smaller that Ipod). Pricing plan on music is great (really 15$ a month for 3 computers and 3 devices!); Browser good be better. On screen volume control. Slightly Pricey. Only a few apps. No Camera
OLED - Amazing quality and vivid colors. User Interface - Intuitive, reactive and easy to use.. Sound quality is superior. Battery life is unreal. Gorilla glass is amazingly strong and scratch-resistant. HD radio. Top notch Device!; Only things that could be considered a con at this point would be that the app store is not yet developed and flash support is not yet available. Once people begin developing more apps, and adobe releases the support, both problems will be solved.
The device is just getting started and amazing, the software is so sexy i love it so much the zune pass is the greatest thing ever i am blown away.. Give this device a month and you will see a large amount of apps and 3D games.; The software has a few bugs but all software does, and btw the bugs don't **** you off they are so small that they won't effect your experience.
Excellent video quality, access internet using wi-fi, get music from other sources and access it from the Zune program, media button on the side accesses controls, HD radio, HD output to TV, Zune Marketplace, free personalization from Zune Originals.; Limited apps, player is small so screen for watching video small (but still very good). EQ is not adjustable; there are only presets (pop, jazz etc).
Absolutely fantastic screen resolution with OLED bright and beautiful. Fantastic interface - intuitive but not overly complex. Excellent experience end to end with ZunePass; Apps? Not very many of them out there... actually very limited in the app department, however, I got the Zune to listen to music not to play a bunch fart apps and games...
The Zune HD is a really nice product in terms of graphics and sound quality. It doesn't really matter right now about the apps since MP3s like the iPod touch are going towards like a race of super MP3s. MP3s real job is to just store music and video.; Nothing. If people want gaming, get a stupid netbook. They're inexpensive
The first thing that would stand out is the absolutely gorgeous screen, I have yet to see anything comparable. ZunePass is awesome if you are into music.; Outside of being an excellent PMP device it currently offers a very limitted selection of apps and games. Hopefully more will come, it does come with some very powerful hardware.
I love the thought of having a hd radio. It better have good sound quality in it unlike the ipod. Another thing is that around the same time the zune hd is to be realeased the new ipod touch is coming out.; The color so far is not to good. I hope they have a solid black zune with lots of memory. Don't make it to expensive Microsoft. Oh, a voice recorder would be nice too.
bottom line if u like to listin to music watch movies t.v. stuff like that then a zune is where its at. the interface is clean and preety simple and for me kinda fun to just shoot around; the amount of apps are limted but if your like me i barely use apps and the ones that are there are good to kill to little time of boredom that might overtake you. the browser is not the fastest and no tabs
- Sexy, sleek, lightweight yet durable. -Long battery life. -Able to stream/download any song from the marketplace on the go. Great quality.. - Interface is beautiful and easy to use. -radio is the best quality I've ever had for a small player; -Wish the platinum was available in all black. I first bought a 16gb and returned it to get the 32 for more space. But I had grown attached to the all black.. -Not a ton of apps available but it's the first week it's out.
Amazing screen, sound much better than any of the ipod models and so hot looking! also- apps, and does not crack easily like ipod touch. zhd can be dropped anywhere!. small, but can read easily. oh, and can turn off screen when just listening 2 music; software does not interact with the zune sometimes. and i dont think i did anything wrong, cuz it charges. also- sometimes screen freezes up when u touch it too fast, no turning up volume without turning on screen. songs/vids take forever to load
The performance and battery life are fantastic. The image detail on screen is vibrant and clear. The HD Radio Tuner and wifi make this pretty close to perfect in terms of a portable media device. And the facebook app is great!; Unfortunately, I can't watch videos via the internet browser because Flash is not supported. No external speaker.
1. Love the interface. 2. Improved WiFi now have the ability to surf the web. 3. Artist Info (When available) is very informative and its on the device. 4. Screensaver is just amazing, its cool to look at while you listening to music. 5. Easy navigation; 1. Apps could be a lot better. 2. Hard to see in direct sunlight (i think that normal on these type of devices). 3. This is no dedicated Vol control button (you have to use the screen to control music playback). 4. Needs more accessories
I just purchased a Zune HD to replace my iPod. The Zune Pass is incredible! Unlimited downloads for $15 is a real bargin. The interest off of the money I saved from not having to buy these songs (iTunes) will pay for the service and more each month.; The only con that I have for the Zune is how I have to explain that what it is and what a Zune Pass is. I have been bombarded with questions from curious friends that don't seem to understand the unlimited downloads for $15 a month.
Great audio and video quality (audio up to 320kbps). Intuitive, beautiful interface- love that it grabs artist bios/pics. Compact, sturdy design that can survive a pretty hefty fall. Responsive touch screen, OLED. Long battery life. Nvidia Tegra..; Lack of apps (there is a respectable indie app community). Hopefully Zune HD users will get a boost with the arrival of the Windows Phone 7 Series devices that will use the same software and similar api.. Slower access to play/pause, volume controls
one of the first to feature hd radio in a hand held device. the oled instead of a on lcd which enables it to be 1080 x 720 which makes it hd audio and video and the oled screen which extends its battery life.; probably no am radio. since flash memory ur going to look at 32 gb or a 16 gb max. hopefully they can release on zune.net so you can get it inscribed. needs more third party support but you can only blame consumers for buying an ipod
It feels more solid than the iPod touch even though it weighs less, the interface is leaps and bounds ahead of Apple's in terms of usefulness and aesthetics. Audio seems to provide a better midrange and bass than the iPod being more treble centered; Feels almost too small at first but you get used to it. People think its an iPod rip-off when you tell them about it, when they see it they are amazed. Glass screen means this Zune will be quite vulnerable as opposed to my Zune 30 which I've dropped.
Screen looks sleek and the tegra chip is a huge bonus The hd radio should be awesome to have if one needs a little bit of a mix up from their daily collection listening. The browser sounds like it will rock and the zune has always performed very well; Fairly new technology, so I didnt really expect to see a 80 gb or 120 gb touch on the market but I simply need more storage lol. I cant put any of my live concerts on my zune because I have well over 30 gb of music.. Not so sure about apps, we'll see
Everything - HD radio, gorgeous screen and easy to use interface; easy setup with PC and Zune 4.0 is best software yet; Zune Pass kicks it up a notch! Wifi, above-average browser, what more can you ask for?; Mac support - but the last time I checked, and I check every morning, ANY Mac can run Windows natively... Apps - Apple opened the App Store with 500 apps, and a good portion of them were not good .
HD Radio. HD Output. Lighter then the touch. OLED Screen. Sturdier then the touch. Zune Pass. Many ways in which to discover new music. Great hardware. Good battery life (33 hours music, 8 for video... I think). Nice Web Browser. Zune Originals. Color choices; OLED does not work well in sunlight. Lack of an app store (The few apps it has are not that great, to be honest). No 64gb. Windows only. No Speaker. Browser, although good, is not as fast as Safari (Noticeable difference) and lacks basic features.
I like the Zune HD because it compact and sleek. The interface is leaps and bounds ahead of the 30 GB Brown brick I have. The ZUNE software is the way to go. You can point it at any folder and almost always play the content.; The ZUNE HD does not have a huge following so there do not appear to be as many apps for it. However; if you are looking for a great MP3 player that plays media like no other; this is the device for you.
