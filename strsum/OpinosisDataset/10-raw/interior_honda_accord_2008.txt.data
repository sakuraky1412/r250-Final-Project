Great ride , roomy interior, legendary Honda reliability .
Solid build, comfortable interior, smooth ride, fuel efficient averaging 27 .
Handles great, awesome fresh interior, lots of cool new features .
I hate to admit that they have loud interiors .
Interior very high end, exterior very upscale look .
My only reservations are the ivory cloth interior's durability had to have taffeta white !
Interior is superb, exterior is very stylish .
Interior is good but has quite a few rattles .
Interior is very comfortable w  ergonomic design in mind .
Purchased Accord Feb 2008 V6 EX Cloth interior .
