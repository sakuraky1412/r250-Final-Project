Pros:. THX audio really makes a difference when you are just used to stereo on other TiVo boxes.. 
Cons:. No lifetime membership. I moved lifetime membership from my Series1. TiVo allowed this for a short time last year. I love the new box, but would not have upgraded without the lifetime membership.. 
Summary:. What is nice about a TiVo over "free" DVRs is the TiVo software. TiVo continues to add options to its software. The latest is an option called "Universal Swivel Search" which searches for programs on tv and for programs you can download from Amazon.com (buy movies, free movies, 0.99 and up movie rental). If you rent or buy DVDs, now you can just download them directly from Amazon to your TiVo player. This search also has a lot of features making is simple to find programs. It's kind of like a google search for your tv.. Shop around for this unit. You should be able to get it for less than $600.. 

$$;
Pros:. Full HD Support - Independent channels. 
Cons:. DRM restrictions on TiVoToGo (currently). 
Summary:. The Series 3 more than pays for itself be enabling me to get the FULL benefits from my HD cable service. By providing TWO completely independent HD tuners, I can be recording 2 HD shows while watching a previously recorded HD show on the plasma. Yes, it requires a fair amount of horsepower to do all of that seamlessly and the Tivo Series 3 is up to the task. Seriously - this is a life-altering device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best DVR interface - pretty good feature set (especially compaired to DTivo). Excellent picture.. 
Cons:. Still a bit expensive. Would like expanded networking features like MRV and Tivo to Go.. 
Summary:. I canceled D*TV and switched to cable just to stay with Tivo -- I love the Series 3. Much better than the SA 8300HD (which I tried out for 2 weeks) and much better than my old R10 DTivo. The Seriews 3 is expensive (altoough available for closer to $600 than $800), but sometimes you get what you pay for..

Pros:. HD, flawless UI. 
Cons:. Expensive (but worth every penny). 

$$;
Pros:. Tivo's perfect user interface, season pass, dual tuners, WEB CONTENT TO MY TV!. 
Cons:. High Price is the only negative. 
Summary:. Like someone else said in their rating, you shouldn't be able to rate this product if you haven't ACTUALLY USED the flippin' thing!. I won't go into too much detail about the product features, other than to say that nobody comes close to Tivo's user interface and functionality. My 6-yr old daughter knows how to operate the Tivo completely. And she only watches what we as parents have decided she should be able to watch.. I do want to address price in a way that hasn't been addressed before. I get RCN cable, phone and broadband internet for $99 per month. The cable is digital cable with HD, but with no premium channels such as HBO. When I decided to go HD, I thought about switching to Comcast and getting one of their non-Tivo DVRs because I thought this would be cheaper than buying a Tivo Series 3. Boy was I wrong! If I had switched to Comcast, I would have paid about $115 per month for the same services for the first year after I signed up, but then it would have jumped to about $145/month. With Tivo, I shelled out $800 per month + an average of about $8.50 per month for Tivo service, but then I'll be saving ($145-$99-$8.50 = $37.50) about $38 per month down the road. I spend more upfront but eventually recoup the money down the road -- And get to have Tivo!. I already run music and slide shows from my PC to my TV and am looking forward to the day when I can look at the top 10 YouTube videos each weak on my Tivo as well as well as other web content that I select. Maybe I'll even be able to have ticker of stocks that I select run across the bottom of the screen on CNBC. Or vote for my favorite American Idol contestant using my Tivo remote. The possibilities are endless and they're no longer pure fantasy..

Pros:. dual HD recording.

$$;
Pros:. It's a TiVo and it's HD.. 
Cons:. The hassle of getting the cable company to install the cable cards.. 
Summary:. The TiVo Series 3 is phenomenal. It is absolutely the best DVR on the market. First of all its a TiVo and it does everything the TiVo is famous for. The picture quality is fantastic on my 50 in HDTV. The Suggestions feature is working on the off line tuner so it is truly transparent to the user. So when you go into the Now Playing you magically find shows that match your viewing preferences that you didnt even know were on TV. Having the name of the shows being recorded display on the front display is a nice touch.. For the people crying because it costs $800. You dont see anyone complaining because a Porsche 911 Carrera costs $100,000. Thats an obscene amount to pay for a car. You are either willing to pay for the best or your not. They complain about it being too little, too late. Too little. Ill say it again. The TiVo Series 3 is absolutely the best DVR on the market. It took along time because 1) TiVo does it right. They dont bring a product to the market until it works. 2) To do this it had to use Cable Cards. If anyone has read some of the horror stories about getting the cable companies to install cable cards in the TiVo and get them working you can imagine what it would have been like a year ago.. P.S. This section is called User Opinions. If you arent a Series 3 user, you dont have a user opinion..

Pros:. HD, Dual Cablecard, OTA, Sata,TIVO!. 
Cons:. No MRV ... yet. 
Summary:. You wanted the best, you got the best. The hottest Tivo in the land .... This is it kids. Buy one, or three, if you can find one. All the pretend Tivo DVR's can now go home.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD on tivo--Very cool. 
Cons:. A lot of money.. 
Summary:. Some of you guess above are idiots. How can you give the Series 3 a low rating when you don't even have it yet. Tivo has the best DVR interface out there. I can't wait for mine. I hope they enable the E-sata port soon..

Pros:. HDTV! Tivotgo! Multiroom! Truly new tv experience. 
Cons:. Price, cablecard!. 
Summary:. I was a big htpc freak. I still am, and I love Sagetv. They have new media extenders out. Unfortunately for me, the tv became an issue. I want more HD channels which is rough to get with htpc. Tivotogo works perfectly. I still use sagetv for pictures,videos, and music, but I use tivo for the tv part. I will write more once I have another tivo in the bedroom and see how multi-view goes.. mo!. 

$$;
Pros:. Wonderful interface. 
Cons:. Price, Tivo to Go. 
Summary:. I finally bit the bullet and went back to Tivo for my High Def viewing pleasure. I got it for $400 after rebate from amazon, which made this a little more affordable. I have nothing really to add as far as reviewing the unit, as i agree with most of the previous comments. it is a wonderful product, and it is great being back with Tivo.. As to price, the cable DVR's are not free, as has been said in a couple of reviews. I payed $15 a month for the DVR service and $12 a month for equipment rental. I laid out $400 for the Tivo and I pay $15 for the service. That means that I pay for my Tivo in 2.5 years. Do people really think that the Cable companies are going to give anything away for free?. 

$$;
Pros:. More Storage then Cable, User Interface, Picture Quality. 
Cons:. Price, Hold Time to Activate, Jealosy of Neighbors. 
Summary:. It was well the worth money. While Tivo advertises about 30 hrs of HD, in my experience we have gotten about 40-45, but it doesn't really matter because you will watch it so much nothing really will sit around (Remember the original TV boxes only got 40 hrs). I've had no cable card issues, and I think the picture quality is actually slightly better then the default cable box the cable company gave us.. 

$$;
Pros:. CAN SEE WHAT IS BEING RECORDED BY NAME. 
Cons:. GOT FOR $650 BUT STILL A BIT PRICY. 
Summary:. LOVE THE FACT THAT IT USES 2 CABLE CARDS SO NO UGLY CABLE BOX. GREAT BACKLIGHT ON REMOTE..AND FINALLY THERE ARE BUTTONS IN CASE YOU CAN'T FIND THAT REMOTE ON THE FRONT OF THIS NEWLY DESIGNED AND GREAT LOOKING MACHINE THANK YOU AGAIN TIVO FOR DOING WHAT I KEPT THINKING. YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE THE CABLE COMPANY BRING AND INSTALL YOUR CARDS FOR A FEE. AS FAR AS THE HD PICTURE...I AM IN HEAVEN! GREAT PRODUCT AND SERVICE FROM TIVO. 

$$;
Pros:. Tivo interface now in HD. Dual tuners. Overall nice home theater addition.. 
Cons:. Some features disabled.. 
Summary:. THis is a fabulous product. It is a bit pricey. I got it with a 12% off coupon and 120 dollars in BB rewards so it didn't hurt too bad. In any case, this is what I have been waiting for since I got a HDTV 3 years ago. The TiVo interface is unmatched. The recordings are done reliably, the suggestions are great, and you can network and stream music from your computer. I also like that this now has two tuners and the option for a wired network which makes things much faster. The tivo to go and multiroom viewing are not here, but i did not use them much anyway. I only have one HDTV, so why would I stream to another TV anyway. I can understand people not being happy about the price, but it was worth it to me. If it's not to you then don't buy it. But all I can say is that this has made watching my TV enjoyable again.. 

$$;
Pros:. never need to leave the house. 
Cons:. never need to leave the house. 
Summary:. This unit is Tivo nirvana. Everything that Tivo offers but with HD and dual-tuners. Yes, you can't multi-room view and a few other networking issues, but I didn't use that on the S2. There can be frustrations with getting cablecards to work but once it's done, then it's done.. 

$$;
Pros:. Auto format switching 480P/1080i, great imaging, 5.1 THX sound and more make it worth the money to me.. 
Cons:. Buttons have appeared on the front panel.. 
Summary:. No more failed digital tuner channel changes! Whoopee. We had a digital cable box which was driven by the IR output on our old SVR-2000. Occasionally the cable box would fail to respond properly, usually after the cable company had updated the cable system, or the power had dropped and the box hadn't reset properly. No more! With the two built-in digital tuners with cablecards we can confidently go away for the weekend and be assured that our TiVo is doing the job.. That is worth about a quarter a day. Over the expected lifetime of the box, 5 years, that's about half the price of the box.. I had bought the Sony SVR-2000 in December 2000 and immediately took a lifetime subscription. That transferred to the new device for free. Another $200.. Finally my wife can not only operate the HD options in our TV (the switching is automatic with this box... not so with the cable company HD box) but she can actually see the difference in the 480p output of the TiVo and the 480i broadcast standard. $150 @ ten cents per day.. Not having to explain why she can't watch and pause a show on a different channel from the one she's recording on... priceless.. THX sound, 5.1 Surround, improved video processing, 30 second skip... all freebie bonuses.. For me it's a real winner. I had been too cheap to upgrade from my original TiVo until now, but it was worth the wait. I'll have to concur with the editors on this one.. Though not the incredible innovation that the first device was, it's a truly wonderful, feature-laden upgrade. There's still no better consumer device, even if there are now buttons on the front panel.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tivo interface, expandability. 
Cons:. Missing some features from Series 2, no on demand or ppv, pretty expensive. 
Summary:. I bought the Tivo Series 3 the day it came out. I had been stuck using Cox Cables Scientific Atlanata HD DVR and was going CRAZY.. Installing the Cable Cards was a hassle. You have to call your cable company and shcedule an appointment. It took them 2 appointments to figure out how to correctly set up the cards. That was pretty frustrating.. The Tivo is up and running now with both CableCards working fine. I absolutely LOVE being back on Tivo on my big screen. One feature is kind of confusing at first. HD recordings show up in a "HD RECORDINGS" and where all the Non-HD recording are. Picture quality is for the most part GREAT (There are times where the picture in some areas of the screen are pixelated. I am not sure if it is the quality of the cable signal or a problem with the Tivo. But it happens very infrequently.) As always the Tivo interface is awesome. Very easy to use and worth every penny of the monthly charge. I bought the 3 year plan which comes out to be about $8.30/month (I am actually saving about $8.00 month in fees compared to the Cox DVR. Still it will take me about 10 YEARS to justify the price of the Tivo.). The media options are pretty cool. I transfered my photos and music over and they look and sound great. I like the podcasts and the Internet radio that you can get to through your Tivo. There are 3 basic games on the Tivo. I don't really understand why they included those games but I have played them a couple of times. I, by nature, am pretty lazy so I can see the Yahoo traffic and weather coming in handy.. The Series 3 also has connections for another hard drive to be added later. It is supposeedly not functioning now but will be with a "later update." I sure hope that is not the same "later update" that never made use of the "Window" button on the remote for the Series 2.. The remote has gotten better. Who would have thought that adding backlit functunality would be so useful. But it is.. Here are my main concerns:. 1. Cost. $799 was pretty high. I am sure that they will come down in price soon enough (Probably by Christmas.). 2. Some features are missing. For instance, on my Tivo Series 2 I have a "RECENTLY DELETED" folder that hangs on to shows for about 24 hours to make sure that you don't accidentally delete a show that you didn't mean to. It is not on the Series 3.. 3. If you can't get the CableCards to work you have very few options for television service. Also with the dependence of CableCards comes no PPV or OnDemand.. 4. When going from Live TV to your Tivo page: 1. It takes longer than you would expect. 2. The screen looks like it is going bad for a second or two. Pretty minor, but little stuff like that shouldn't happen after paying $799 for the machine.. All in all, I would definately reccomned this DVR. Those whom have never used Tivo don't know what you are missing. The Tivo interface is heads and shoulders above every DVR I have ever used. Hopefully the price will come down and they will, at the very least, add all of the functions available on the Series 2..

Pros:. 2 HD tuners, TiVo interface, network features, .... 
Cons:. Yep, it's pricey, but it's worth it!. 
Summary:. I finally got to get rid of that nasty Time Warner box (8300). I had gone thru 3 boxes and finally gave up and lived w/the problems with the last one. Good riddance!. The TiVo s3 box and remote are beautiful and work as advertised, right from the start. I took advantage of the transfer of lifetime service. I got the first s3 from the local BestBuy - they had just gotten them in.. Can't speak highly enough of the responsiveness of the s3. And the beauty of the video and audio quality. Now, I just have to wait for the eSATA port to be enabled and I'm all set.. Don't pay attention to the low ratings - they are all about $$ (which does matter, but I'd rather have quality than the alternative any day).. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use, very fast / responsive, highly reliable, incredible picture quality; extremely high wife acceptance factor (WAF). 
Cons:. Some features like TivoToGo not enabled yet. 
Summary:. I had to drive 45 minutes to buy this thing yesterday. Guess they are selling pretty fast at the moment. Thankfully, I was able to pickup two CableCards from the local Comcast office on the way home. They wanted to schedule a truck roll, but I insisted on doing it myself and they gave in after a few minutes.. The Tivo Series3 is priced like a high-end product, but from what I've seen, it delivers high-end performance. If you have cable and are serious about picture quality, sound quality, and reliable recording, this box is a must have. After using this thing, I don't know how I ever managed to live with the crap-in-a-box that Comcast calls a DVR. I didn't think the Comcast DVR was that bad until I used this thing; the Comcast box was annoying at times, but hell, it worked for the most part and was only $10/month. In that regard, using the Tivo Series3 has really been an eye-opening experience.. My expectations were pretty high from all the hype going around, but the box lives up to it and more. I never realized how much the Comcast DVR was degrading my picture. If you've ever felt like there was a haze over your HD channels at times...this box fixes it. I guess the old saying applies...sometimes you get what you pay for.. I spent some time with the original Tivo a few years ago before I gave it up for HDTV. If you've ever used an older Tivo, this box differs in the following ways:. 1) completely -replaces- your cable box;. 2) records any two SD or HD channels simultaneously, while allowing you to watch a third pre-recorded program;. 3) seamlessly integrates SD and HD channels from analog and digital cable (and an antenna if you have one) into a single guide with 14-days of program information;. 4) interface and DVR functions are very fast and responsive compared to past Tivos and cable company DVRs;. 5) tunes channels as fast as your cable dvr;. 6) records all digital channels at 100% original quality;. 7) records analog cable channels at higher quality than any previous DVR / DVD recorder;. 8) features high-definition widescreen menus and program guide - no more crappy low-res interfaces with black bars on the sides;. 9) potential for much larger storage capacity with external SATA port for hard drive expansion;. 10) 100Mbps networking built-in (wireless adapter optional) to play back music and pictures stored on your PC or Mac.. This will be a 10/10 product as soon as Tivo drops the price a little and enables a few more features like TivoToGo. TivoToGo is a feature on other Tivos that allows you to transfer recordings to your PC, but it's not on the Series3 yet. I asked about this when I called Tivo today and they said a software update was coming in November that would enable some additional features.. Ok, so is it really worth $800? Is it really worth half your mortgage payment? From what I've seen so far, it probably is worth the price. Like I said before, this box has a high price but it also delivers very high performance. It gives me a noticably better picture than I got with the Comcast SA DVR. I think it would be a value at $500, but it's not at $800, especially since some features like TivoToGo aren't enabled in the current software. My advice for more value-conscious buyer is to wait until this thing hits $400 or $500 and Tivo enables some of those extra features in November. Then it'll be a steal for what it offers.. As an aside, this is the first purchase in recent history that my SO actually approved of after using it. She didn't think the HDTV was worth $2500, she didn't think the Harmony remote was worth $150, and she didn't think the surround sound system was worth $1000. So far, she DOES think this box is worth $500. Of course, I lied and told her that was how much I paid. After seeing the expression on her face after buying the $150 Harmony, I couldn't bear to come home and tell her I just spent $800 on a box for the TV.. (Wish I could get my money back for the Harmony remote, the new Series3 remote is incredible -- gloss piano back, great ergonomic design, wonderful feel and feedback on the buttons, light sensor based backlight, and it's a learning remote. It makes my Harmony look and feel like a cheap piece of plastic.).

Pros:. Finally! 2-tuner HD and CableCARD. 
Cons:. not cheap and no more lifetime service!. 
Summary:. I've been waiting forever for this unit. I bought a SXRD HDTV late last year and sadly view little HD content since everything I watch is on my TiVo. I ordered a Series3 today! Finally HD TiVo and CableCARD support. Can't wait. It's not cheap but should be everything any TiVo user wants in HD -- and it is replacing two SD TiVos for me (that I've had at least 5 years!) with the dual tuner support. Now if only TiVo offered lifetime service for this unit!.

$$;
Pros:. Dual tuner, Cable Card ready, HD recording, same great Tivo interface. 
Cons:. Price, copy protection, price, no access to VOD from cable company, price. Did I mention price?. 
Summary:. The Series 3 is exactly what I have been waiting for. It has been a pain to watch TV shows and sporting events outside of my Tivo just to see it in HD. It's amazing how much you miss being able to watch what you want when you want it without commercials. Now I can have my HD Tivo cake and eat it to. Albeit an $800 dollar cake!!!!! And I thought the new PS3 was expensive! (Funny how CNET didn't put the price on the "overview" page.) Since me and my wife are die-hards, we'll probably get one. But the sad part is the price will most likely force more casual people to use generic DVR's from their cable companies. Too bad.. 

$$;
Pros:. Now has all the advantages and features of other TiVos plus HD. 
Cons:. Overall price.. but not what I paid. 
Summary:. Now that they have updated the features for TiVotogo etc.. this set is great. If you love TiVo you will love this HD set. It is great and I am so happy that I purchased it. The remote itself is amazing. I purchased this set from an online retailer who was selling it for $559 and I had a $200 mail in rebate. Now you can get it for $399.99 at CompUSA. It is worth every penny. I have had this set since June 2007. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Picture Quality and Ease of Use. 
Cons:. Expensive to buy and operate, no TiVo-to-go. 
Summary:. This is the cream of the crop. Tivos search capabilities have yet to be duplicated by anyone. And a recent new swivel search has added to those capabilities. The season pass feature is godsend to series fans as well as the dual tuner capability. The picture quality is the best I have seen from any DVR. And, of course, Tivos intuitive menus are the best I have seen. The remote is simple to use and handle. Those are the pros. Now on to the cons: unfortunately, there are a few. The number one complaint is that the unit is very expensive at $799.99. It is also expensive to operate as it requires 2 cable cards to get dual tuner capability (I think that an updated model doesnt need this). Also, the cable cards are unidirectional, which means that on-demand content from your cable company cannot be accessed. Finally, the Tivo-to-go feature is disabled because of copyright worries and there is no i-link connection to connect to DVHS recorder.. To sum up, for those willing to pay a premium price for a DVR, this unit is the best money can buy (even with a few drawbacks).. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful UI flow, high def delivered the way it ought to be.. 
Cons:. Price (of course), no TiVo ToGo!!. 
Summary:. This is my 3rd TiVo (series 1, 2 and now 3). I upgraded to the series 3 and haven't looked back. The device is snappy and rock solid. Now that you can attach an external hard drive, the decision should be a NO-BRAINER.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazon.com $600.00. 
Cons:. Don't buy it from TiVo. 
Summary:. TiVo Series3 HD DVR - Love it, gets a "8" Excellent, Amazon.com now at $600.00.. 

$$;
Pros:. TiVo continues to upgrade; dual tuner HDTV; no need for addition cable box; large storage. 
Cons:. Price; all features not available yet. 
Summary:. Please disregard the reviews that don't actually review the product. Yeah it's expensive but does that mean you give an extremely lower rating based solely upon the price? C'mon now, price should be one to two points in the rating.. Please, move to an area where you are forced to use Comcast or Time Warner Cable HDTV DVR boxes and this TiVo is worth every single darn penny!. My finances are very tight right now but after reading what this puppy can do, then reading and watching the unbiased reviews by experts, and just flat out knowing the quality of the TiVo product, I logged into Amazon.com and purchased it for $659.99! No hesitation and slept well that night knowing my pain and anguish with the cable boxes would soon be over.. With this said, please read carefully the reviews here and decide for yourself...sometimes things are worth the extra money. Sometimes you need to review items based upon how good they actually are and not the price.. I took two points off of their score due to the high price and features not fully implemented. Otherwise this box rocks!. 

$$;
Pros:. More output options, great sound, ACTUALLY RECORDS SHOWS you tell it to.. 
Cons:. channel changing lags a bit, TiVo to go and other TiVo benefits not available yet.. 
Summary:. I'm not sure what SA DVR model I was stuck with, but when Bright House (Time Warner in Fla.) debuted the thing it was unwatchable. Especially for someone that actually had used a TiVo. The features simply didn't work. Recording was a crapshoot (simply wouldn't record about 1 in 4 scheduled recordings), and if you were "time shifting" while a show was actually airing, it would simply dump you out when it hit the end of it's schedule (and empty the buffer, so you couldn't go back).. After a couple of months I returned it. Apparently so did a number of others, because about a year later the cable company called me and proudly exclaimed that Scientific Atlanta had updated the software, and the DVR "should work now." (?). Nope. Tried several boxes, result were basically the same as the first box. I kept it because the wife demanded the ability to pause/rewind TV. (Which really is about the only thing it could do consistently.) But it sat on top of a VCR and one of my series 2 TiVos.. I have the TiVo Series 3 now, and it is not flawless, but it simply does what it is supposed to do. I'm confident that TiVo will add the features the series 2 has, slowly, like they did with the S2.. The SOUND out of the TiVo is worlds better than the SA. The video out options are much more varied. I even feel like the picture is better (because I can use better cables with the TiVo). Once my cable company realized I wanted cablecards, and that they both were going in the same box, things got a bit easier. The first two idiots they sent out didn't even bring cable cards (???). When one with a brain came out he actually brought a bunch, we found 2 (of 8) that initialized quickly and let them go. Haven't had any major issues with them, but you can tell they are also an emerging technology that will hopefully improve.. Just a note ... the S3 can be found for much less than $800 if you look hard enough ... it's less than $650 on this page as I type, but I found it for even less.. Finally, as a long-time TiVo customer, I have found that they are pretty responsive to customer feedback. It isn't always quick (See TiVo To Go for Macs) but they are open to suggestions, and good ideas. They are a good company that still innovates, I hope that stick around.. 

$$;
Pros:. Dual tuner capability, HD, fantastic sound and a great remote. 
Cons:. Expensive, no "Tivotogo", no On Demand capability. 
Summary:. The first thing you will notice about series 3 is the price. But for those that are into their video system, it is worth the price. The dual tuner (cableCARDs) capability is nice (I thought it was overkill initially but have had to use it on numerous occasions). The sound is much improved versus series 2. 6.1 sounds great as does Prologic II.. The high def capability makes watching live TV worth while (used to have to sacrifice HD when wathcing live with series 2. Don't have to anymore).. Tivotogo is an unfortunate exclusion. As a traveler, it sure is a handy feature. I am currently using my series 2 box in order to save video to my laptop.. There is a lot of debate regarding cableCARDS and series 3. I personally have not had issues although installation was somewhat confusing to the cable guy. It appears that the cable company doesn't have much experience. But here is what has to be considered if you have installation issues:. 1. Have the cable guy be sure the actual cards are not defective. My guy brought extras due to a high defect rate.. 2. After the cable guy installs the card into series 3, there is a short delay while the box reads the card. Be patient and wait it out. Series 3 will inform you when it is finished reading the card.. 3. After the cards are recognized by series 3, the cable guy has to write down a series of codes, of which he needs to recite to the cable company. This is a point of error as there is quite a bit of info that he has to recite. If he gives the cable company wrong info or the cable company enters it into their computer wrong, it won't work. BE SURE TO GET A COPY OF THE STUFF THE CABLE GUYS WRITES DOWN. You might need it later if you have a problem.. 4. The cable company, once the info from the cable guy is entered into the computer, has to enter an authorization code, which allows the cableCARDs to decode the pay channels that you are currently subscribing to. In my case, I get all pay channels (HBO, etc). If the cable company enters the wrong authorization code, the cableCARDS will not decode the channels. This happened during my installation. The first outcome was that basic cable only was working with the cards. The cable company then changed the authorization code to include pay channels and it all worked out.. DON'T LET THE CABLE GUY GO UNTIL YOU CHECK CHANNELS ON ALL TIERS THAT YOU SUBSCRIBE! I think the mistake that people make is letting the guy go and then having a different cable guy come back when there is an issue, essentially starting all over again.. The word on 2 way cableCARDS (2.0): The reason on demand and pay per view are not possible with the current cableCARD technology (1.0) is because the current technology only can communicate 1 way (the cable company communicates with series 3). The next generation of cards (2008) will allow series 3 to communicate with the cable company (i.e. ordering a movie, etc.). For now, if you want on demand, keep your set top box (that is what I did).. Summary: With series 3 and my set top cable box, I can now do the following:. Watch 2 different programs simultaneously (PIP, cable box and DVD tuner) while TiVo records 2 completely different channels simultaneously. 4 programs functioning on one television simultaneously.. Watch Live TV in HD mode.. Watch DVDs with excellent THX sound and fantastic 1080i HD.. Watch On Demand and PPV with excellent 6.1 sound.. Listen to my 2000 song library (stored on my PC) through TiVo and my Prologic setting on my surround system (nice thing to do on a lazy Sunday morning over coffee).. Download TiVo recordings onto my DVD burner.. Download TiVo recordings onto my laptop using series 2 (set up on another monitor).. For the hardcore, go for it. If you're a casual viewer, wait a couple of years for pricing to drop and for cableCARD 2.0 to be released.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD, recording quality, user interface, network ability, dual tuners. 
Cons:. Price, CableCard installation, price. 
Summary:. Being an early adopter of TiVo, I knew I had to get a Srs3 box as soon as I could. I bit the bullet, ordered an upgraded box (500 meg storage) through an on-line vendor and got the box last Friday. So far I am still waiting for the CableCard installation (I could not convince the local Comcast place to let me have two for self-installation). I have been watching standard cable and over the air HD , though, and the quality is great. Why did I fork over the big bucks now? I was able to transfer my lifetime service and get a year free on the Srs 2 box. When I weighed the monthly fees going on for ever over the initial price and transfer fee ($199), I convinced myself the price was reasonable. Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Software (if you've never had it, how can you possibly comment), Ease of use, Recordable space, &#38; Quality, Lifetime subscription transfer option before Jan 31, 2007. 
Cons:. Price, If I didn't have such a short deadline to switch my lifetime I wouldn't have bought it now. Lacking multi room viewing, TTG, TTCB, Series 2 didn't initially either though, So let's be fair.. 
Summary:. Other than the ridiculous price for S3, it performs like a champ. The only reason I bought now is that I have the option to transfer my lifetime subscription. The catch however is that I must complete the transfer no later that Jan 31, 2007. So I really had no option of waiting until Tivo lowers the MSRP. I do not like how tivo gives their "Loyal VIP" customer base a "Sh$t or get off the pot" option. But it is what it is and i'd rather pay $199 For lifetime than some absurd 3 year subsciption. I don't think i'd even buy tivo now with that option. My wife and I have had Tivo for 7 years now there is no turning back. As for the missing features, some long standing Tivo users may remember that, when Series 2 was released, it too had none of the added software it has today. Tivo is great about doing updates and i'm confident it is all in due time. I have been using the cable provided HD DVR (Scientific Atlanta 8300) in my living room for the past 3 months and it is so unreliable. I have made do with it long enough and decided to "pony up" the cash for Series 3. It has worked like a gem and I will continue to support Tivo. I gave it an 8 by the standards of Cnet's rating system but i'm sure that by this time next year, it will warrant a 10 because there will be no "minor drawbacks".. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. 
Cons:. have to use cable. 
Summary:. I need a question answered. I love Tivo, but my SO had us to change from DirectTV to cable, so he could use his new HDTV. Cable and I don't get along (besides their *#@&#38;^% DVR), I don't have my LOCAL CHANNELS as their REAL NUMBERS!!!!! Is there any way to "reprogram" the newest Tivo to recognize my local ABC affiliate (8) as the High Def channel? I'm sorry but I really like surfing my local channels in sequence (4,5,8,11 &#38; 13, yes, North Central Texas). Heaven only knows what HD channel numbers they are with this *&#38;&#38;^% cable box!! Does anyone have a solution for me? I could be happy with cable and gladly pay any money necessary for the newest Tivo, if my local channels were "the real numbers".. 

$$;
Pros:. It's Tivo for High Definition! Tuners- 2 over the air &#38; 2 cable, HDMI output, supports cable cards (so you can get rid of your set top box). 
Cons:. Relatively expensive ($800 for now), some of the Tivo series 2 features aren't available yet, such as transfer between boxes.. 
Summary:. I was late to the Tivo party, but I'm a serious convert now. I've had a Tivo Series 2 for a few years. I recently upgraded my TV to HD but wished I could record the HD programs just like my standard def programing. I was excited to hear Tivo was offering a HD recorder with 250GB of storage - 30 hours of HD or 300 hours of standard def programing. Lots of people are upset that Tivo priced it at $800. I'd like to point out that the Tivo HD recorder they produced for Direct TV was originally priced at $1000 when it was released a couple years ago, and it only had a single tuner. Last year Sony sold their 250GB single tuner HD recorder for $800. (However, many owners complained about the buggy and inconsistent performance of the Sony HD DVR in the AVS Forum. Apparently it wasn't up to the normal quality expected from a Sony product.). For $800, the HD Tivo comes with a dual tuner with HDMI output and THX certification to ensure quality playback. Furthermore, you've got the easy to use Tivo programing guide. So compared to HD DVR's you can purchase, the price vs. the features offered make this a reasonable price. And both of these previous DVR's came down in price eventually, so if you're willing to wait, you'll save even more money. (It's always more expensive to be an early adopter.). Many people have commented on the shortcomings of this box. It's true you can't use it with satelite cable (it'll still work for over the air) and you can't (at least at this point) transfer recordings between 2 Tivo boxes. Neither of these items are deal breakers for me. I can still do my season passes, wish lists and download the program schedule wirelessly.. Tivo continues to offer more features as they improve their products, and this box will be no exception. One feature said to be coming soon: the ability to expand the storage space with an off the shelf external hard drive, no internal installation required (unlike older Tivos). So if 30 hours of HD isn't enough, add another 500GB and triple your storage. Bottomline, it's HD Tivo and I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I ordered one. 
Cons:. You can't afford one. 
Summary:. Sing along (Eddie Murphy Old School Style) - You got no Tivo. You got no Tivo. You on the welfare. You on the welfare. And you daddy's an alcoholic.. Good things cost $$$$. SUX2BU. 

$$;
Pros:. TiVoToGo and Multi-Room Viewing are available on any TiVo Series 3 and HD DVRs with a network connection and software version 9.1 or later.. 
Cons:. Interactive digital cable services such as video-on-demand, enhanced program guide, and pay-per-view services still require the use of a separate cable company-provided set-top box.. 
Summary:. In October 2007, TiVo made TiVoToGo and Multi-Room Viewing available on all their HD DVDs, as long as the user has a network connection and upgraded TiVo software version 9.1 or later.. The problem of accessing interactive digital cable services, may be resolved by mid-2008. Several companies, including TiVo, which have hardware requiring the use of CableCARDs, are pushing the development of a "tuning resolver", which will plug into a USB 2.0 port on units already in use, allowing them to access interactive digital cable services. Currently, the device specifications are undergoing an intellectual property review. CableLabs chief technology officer Ralph Brown, says they hope to be able to release the approved specs in early 2008. It is predicted that TiVo may have their "tuning resolver" available by mid-2008, although they have not set a price, as yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD HD HD; User Interface; The remote; Ease of Use;. 
Cons:. The Price; No Tivo to Go; No Multiroom Viewing; HD only partially implemented; Way to late to Market. 
Summary:. Let me start right out by saying that I have 4 of these all of them upgraded to 750Gb hard drives. Capable of handling just under 100 hours of HD each.. Tivo always started as a high end box. Tivo users have been waiting for this box for more than 2 years. They really disappointed there fan base with the lateness of this delivery. I have to move to Motorola HD DVR's in the interim and these boxes were simply ridiculous. When these boxes were release I got rid of the cable company boxes as fast as I could.. Prior to this I had series two's and one's. I am a long time Tivo fan.. To get HD on this box we definitely had to go backwards in terms of functionality. Lost Tivotogo and Multiroom, which is very painful. Tivo tell us this is coming back - but not idea when. Problem is now Microsoft seems to have this fixed already with Cablecard Vista Media Center and XBox 360. I am going to give this a try soon.. Amazon Unbox support is great - but again no HD and a ridiculous explanation from Tivo and Amazon on why? Again Microsoft seem to have this fixed too.. Anyway - I do like the service - but Tivo please get your finger out and fix the HD services on this platform ASAP.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has practically everything I'd want in an HD TiVo. 
Cons:. Expensive. Obiviously.. 
Summary:. When I first saw CNets e-mail on this, I was practically jumping for joy! FINALLY!! Then I saw the current price point. Ugh! So, instead of me going out and getting one ASAP, I'll wait for the cost to drop. I'm giving it a 7 and reserve the right to change my opinion after I get one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally a decent HD DVR box with a usable ui. 
Cons:. Ouch... that's a serious price. 
Summary:. As Time Warner cable has an exclusive stangle hold on the local cable market here, I am immediately concerned as to whether this new box will work on Time Warner Cables system. Any word of this from anyone?. 

$$;
Pros:. HD, Good price, Snazzy design. 
Cons:. Won't work with cable box. 
Summary:. Make sure you call your company well in advance of getting this box. It's snazzy and cool but designed to work only with cablecards. So if your cable company is like mine and has a backlog in orders, you can expect weeks with no TIVO service at all. This should be clearly stated and is in my mind a mistake. There are no inputs other than cablecards and one for basic cable or antenna. Who uses those anymore? Digital cable boxes do not work with this TIVO. Beware!!!. The other thing that is annoying is the buttons on the remote have been slightly condensed. That means when you are using the channel down button you easily hit the "thumbs up" button, which is of no use to me personally.. I wish TIVO would get its act together on these boxes. The product is basically good but they drop the ball on some basic stuff.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent menuing, great OTA HD recordings. 
Cons:. Business decisions have deleted features that the Series2 had.. 
Summary:. While I thought that John Falcone's review is mostly accurate and I agree that the Series3 is a very good product, some business decisions that Tivo made, make the Series3 a flawed product.. Inputs:. The Series3 has Antenna and Cable inputs. However the Cable input is RF only. TiVo could have include an HDMI input for recording from some HDMI compatible source such as DirecTV. People tell me that the DirecTV signal is not compatible with the Series3. If a signal can go from a DirecTV reciever to my TV then it can be recorded by the Series3 with the addition of some hardware and software to the package.. Networking:. I sent the following to TiVo with regards to another busines decision that the made. &lt;&lt;I understand your concerns about copyright infringement. However, the new TiVo Series3 box is a computer. On my computer, I can designate some files as sharable over a network and other files as private. Why can't you?. The TiVo Series3 box should:. 1. Be able to access and show any file recorded on a Series2 machine (multi-room viewing). 2. Any file recorded on a Series3 box via the OTA (over the air) or Antenna source should be mark sharable and available for viewing by other Series2 (standard definition oly) or Series3 (both SD and HD fornats) boxes.. 3. Any file from the cable source can be flagged as private and not sharable.. This can be accomplished easily through your programming. Add a routine to the recording process that checks to see if the source is cable and then flag that file as Private. All other files should be flagged as Sharable. Then add to the code used by the Series2 boxes to check for Private vs Sharable files and add this code to the Series3.. Will Mullen. TiVoing since 2002&gt;&gt;. The two business decisions that TiVo has made with regard to the Series3 means that in one instance, they are deliberatly writing off all their DirecTV customers, forcing those costomers to switch to cable or live without premium channels. In the other instance, TiVo removes from its feature list the ability of its customers that own multiple boxes, the ability to reocord in one location in the home and to view that recording in another. Neither business decision is sound and as a result I must rate the Series3 box at a lower level than Mr. Falcone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek Look, Lots of Disk Space, High Quality Sound. 
Cons:. Very Glitchy Software. 
Summary:. In addition to very slow channel change there is a software conflict between the unit and Scientific Atlanta cable cards that requires the use of the lower quality component video connections instead of the higher quality and more convenient HDMI connection.. TiVo tech support says that this is a known problem and that they are working on a software upgrade. Also said the problem is limited to Scientific Atlanta cards (Motorola, they say, work fine). Maybe so, but SA is a significant player in this market and to launch a box at this price that, in essence, doesn't permit the full experience that TiVo suggests is the differenciator between in and much lower cost (or free) boxes is a bit of a misrepresentation. If I'd know about this glitch. I would have waited to purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Dual Tuners, Off Air Tuner, Cable Cards. 
Cons:. No Tivo To Go, No Multi-Room Viewing. 
Summary:. Note: The CNet review is still not correct after they updated it; the series 3 does NOT yet have multi-room viewing available. You can see this right on the Tivo site:. http://www.tivo.com/2.0.3hdDvr.faq.asp#8. ***. I have been a loyal Tivo fan since purchasing my series one years ago. I've purchased them as gifts several times as well. However, without the advanced networking features, this just isn't a compelling upgrade.. I currently have the HR10-250 - the DirecTV HD Tivo, as I suspect a lot of huge Tivo fans do. There were two big features that DirecTV didn't give me that would have made me run out and buy this, even at the $800 price point: Tivo To Go and Multi-Room Viewing. Although they indicate that they'll be coming at some point in the future, there's no firm date.. If they do enable these features in the future, I'll take a second look. But for now, I'll have to take a pass. With the new higher-capacity iPods, this could have been awesome.. Supposedly, the Windows Vista media center options will also support cable cards... but also have the downloading and multi-room capabilities. I hope Tivo gets on the ball before January..... 

$$;
Pros:. HD finally!. 
Cons:. Cable Card= nightmare. 
Summary:. The menu option on Scientific Atlantic boxes are not that bad. I will give the nod to TIVO's inovative menus and interface but not $800 worth. The cable cards are iffy at best. I look forward to trying to install one in one of these boxes. I work for Cox in Arizona and I know these cable cards are a work in progress. Just get the DVR from the cable company and enjoy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Record in HD. 
Cons:. Does not support SDV. 
Summary:. Ok so I bought one of these but now I wished I've waited! It seems like cable companies are now starting to convert to SDV:. http://dtv.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=98553. And this "new" Tivo does not support it. Check out what Tivo had to say in their FCC filing:. http://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/ecfs/retrieve.cgi?native_or_pdf=pdf&#38;id_document=6518400258. Now this wouldn't bother me so much if Tivo would come out and say that they will be providing their customers a way to get the new HD channels but Tivo hasn't said or written a word on it. For $800 I want to know that the S3 will not be obsolete in a year or two!. 

$$;
Pros:. Dual HDTV tuners, Tivo quality user interface, internet scheduling, dual antenna and cable inputs. 
Cons:. Very difficult cable card installation, missing features found in the Series 2, expensive. 
Summary:. I have been using the Tivo Series 3 for about one week. I paid about $650 on eBay which is still very expensive but not quite the $800 retail price. So far, I think maybe it was not worth the money. But I am not ready to return it or give it up.. The CNET review is accurate. I actually did not read any reviews before purchasing and just assumed the Series 3 would contain all the features found in the Series 2. So I am VERY dissapointed about that. I hope Tivo will send out an operating system update that brings it up to par with the Series 2.. When Cox Communications came out to install the two cable cards, the service guy told me that it was going to be hard. I did not believe him. Silly me. He spent about 4 hours trying to get one card to work. He had to leave and come back and finally he got them working. Only now there are about 5 stations that have SEVERE tiling and they are not viewable on the Tivo. I would be calling Tivo and demanding a refund (even though I did not buy it from them) except that all the stations happen to be local stations that I am receiving via over the air HDTV anyway.. That brings me to one of the features I like the best about this Tivo. In my area, Cox has not been able to negotiate a deal with the local ABC and FOX stations to carry the HDTV signals. So I have to use an antenna to receive them. The Tivo allows you to simultaniously connect an antenna and cable. Not only that, but the antenna channels are mixed in with the cable channels so as you surf up, you cannot tell if the channel is OTA (over the air) or cable. Very cool. And very user friendly.. I am still waiting for Cox to do some more work to fix the stations that are tiling. Hopefully they will find something that will fix the problem. But I am not holding out much hope. One note about the tiling: at least one Cox HD station has a slight bit of tiling. The station is still watchable but it can be irritating.. Should you purchase this DVR? I cannot recommend it. I am not ready to give mine up but maybe I would have saved the money if I had known how many problems there are.. One more note about the cable card problem: I called Tivo and they told me that there is a known compatibility issue with the cards Cox uses. Unbelievable! How can they release a product and not ensure that it works with one of the largest cable companies in the country????. 

$$;
Pros:. Dual Tuner is Nice--Ships with HDMI Cable. 
Cons:. No Multi-Room Viewing or Downloading. 
Summary:. I think Tivo will eventually get all the features intact, but I was disappointed that it didn't ship with all the feature that have been available in the Series 3 for quite some time. A Tivo rep told me that the software revision is underway, but we'll have to wait and see.. I did like that fact that I didn't have to go purchase an aftermarket cable. That's happened before to me--bought a high-end piece of equipment and then needed to purchase an over-priced, after-market cable. Good job on that one Tivo.. 

$$;
Pros:. User Interface/ease of use. 
Cons:. Price, Price, Price. 
Summary:. No way this is worth the money they are asking - between the buying price and subscription. Doesn't even have the differentiating features like TivoToGo and Multi-Room viewing. Worst thing, I think though, is that they are screwing their loyal base of customers who stuck with them for years and waited on them for this Series 3. A real disappointment to me, and now I'll just stick with my cable company DVR that's just &lt; $10/mon.. 

$$;
Pros:. No problem using it with Comcast.. 
Cons:. I'm dumping Comcast for FiOS. 
Summary:. Verizon will offer their version of a HD recorder next Jan in my area. Then its goodbye Comcast, Goodbye S.A. 8300HD. 

$$;
Pros:. HD Recording, Real Tivo Look and Feel. 
Cons:. No Tivo To Go, No Multi-Room Viewing, Tivo Support. 
Summary:. I'm a long-time Tivo owner with more money than sense. User interface superior to Motorola DCT dual-tuner DVR from cable company (Insight). Quality of digital recordings comparable. Interesting options for 1080i/720p/480p viewing (native, hybrid, upconverting, plus 16:9 screen-filling stretch modes). I can live without Tivo To Go but I really miss multi-room viewing and the Recently Deleted folder. I'd be happy with being able to transfer analog recordings back and forth with Series2. Tivo support has been slow and not particularly helpful. My system locked up and never fully recovered after ONE week of use. Still waiting for Tivo's replacement to ship (with temporary $799 charge to speed replacement delivery!). I hope the next one lasts longer! I won't be replacing my other DVR from cable company any time soon. Not worth the expense yet, IMHO.. 

$$;
Pros:. TIVO's Great Software. 
Cons:. Paying $800 for Something that is Free. 
Summary:. I switched from a Series2 to a Motorola/Comcast/TimeWarner DVR because I got tired of only getting regular cable from a Plasma just to have TIVO. I was hoping to switch back when the Series3 came out but.... Yeah, Cable DVRs suck. The Software is slow and complicated, not enough space for heavy HD recording, and they seem hellbent on pushing OnDemand. But I only pay $12.95 a month for a Dual tuner DVR that records in HD, and that gets replaced if it burns out.. Why would I pay $800 for the same thing from TIVO? ARE THEY CRAZY!? I love Tivo software and their basic functionality. But nothing is worse that kind of price premium. Even TIVO offers free Tivos for a subscription.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything you've ever wanted in a DVR. 
Cons:. It costs $800 freakin' dollars! (+$13/month). 
Summary:. Man did I want to buy this, but how can one justify the premium? As a LONG TIME tivo user, Tivo shareholder. , and overall HDTV junkie I WANTED this product. But for 2 years Ive been suffering through the Scientific Atlanta 8300HDs horrible interface, lack of network options, etc. and have finally adapted to it. Ive even trained my wife to use it. Now this comes out and somehow I have to think of the yes it is about the same, honey, but heres why we need to spend $800 so I can check fantasy scores/weather/movie times on Tivo argument. Not going to happen. Now Im going to have to wait several more years for the price to someday fall and continue to suffer through the 8300HD. DARN you TIVO!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great when it works. 
Cons:. Have already had to replace one for a known problem that they can't fix. Now the replacement is doing the same thing as the first one. Tivo wants to walk me through all the same troubleshooting steps repeatedly.. 
Summary:. It is a lot of money to spend and it is great when it works like advertised, but it is difficult to get good customer service for this product. Tivo does not want to admit there is a problem with this item. 

$$;
Pros:. FCC changes the way we view their services!. 
Cons:. Now you can won it faults and all.... 
Summary:. Starting July 1, cable operators will be required to provide set-top boxes that don't include integrated security features that link the box to that operator.. The FCC believes that by separating the set-top box from the cable operator, a marketplace would be created in the sales of the boxes, which could lead to driving down the prices consumers pay for cable television.. Several major consumer electronics manufacturers have argued that if set-top boxes weren't directly linked to the provision of cable service, they could enter the set-top market. Consumers could get a cable card from their service provider that they could insert into a set-top box purchased at a consumer electronics store. The cards would ensure that consumers could only access channels that they paid for.. Comcast had appealed to the FCC, saying that cable cards are soon to be made redundant by technology that would allow the security features of the card to be downloaded directly.. The industry's lobby group, the National Cable &#38; Telecommunication Association, has estimated that the FCC rule will cost consumers an extra $600 million a year, based on an estimate of $2 to $3 per card.. The FCC rejected this argument, but did leave Comcast the right to appeal.. In a statement late Wednesday, Comcast said it was "very disappointed" and called the FCC's decision "regrettable.". "The rejection of this waiver means millions of American consumers won't have the opportunity to enter the age of digital television easily and affordably," the company said. "This amounts to an FCC tax of hundreds of millions of dollars on consumers with no countervailing benefits.". Comcast said it will immediately seek a full FCC review.. The FCC did conditionally approve a waiver request from a smaller cable operator, Bend Cable Communications, which said it planned to make the full transition to a digital signal by 2008.. This transition is seen by the FCC as a higher priority than the creation of a market for set-top boxes.. The FCC also said it would delay enforcement action against other smaller cable operators that have placed orders for new-style boxes with manufacturers, but have been told they won't be ready by July 1.. Earlier Wednesday, speaking at a question-and-answer session at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Martin said that he was not likely to grant the waivers of the largest players in the cable industry who have asked for them simply because they think a better technology is around the corner.. The deadline has already been extended twice; companies were initially supposed to have been compliant by July 1, 2005.. The dispute over set-top boxes is the latest in a rapidly deteriorating relationship between Martin and the cable industry.. In December, Martin pushed through reform of the cable TV franchising process, which makes it easier for telephone companies to provide video services and compete with cable operators.. And Martin has repeatedly said that the cable industry is the only industry the FCC regulates in which rates have consistently increased while all others have dropped off in the last decade.. -Contact: 201-938-5400.

Pros:. Excellent guide and programming. 
Cons:. It's just a DVR, way over expensive. 
Summary:. I bought this unit from tivo, it was a special for $570.00 including the wireless internet adapter. While the programming was nice and had way more features than my Scientific Atlanta 8300HD DVR when you come right down to it all it is; is just a DVR. I found myself watching TV shows exactly the same way. Their movie rental guide is not much different than Cox Cable's here in Las Vegas. Picture quality between the two is pretty much the same. Both quite good in my standards. The sound quality through the analog outputs was better with the TiVo (probably the THX certification) but through the digital outputs hooked up to my processor the differences were very similar with maybe a slight edge to the TiVo. So I had to ask myself, is this worth over $500 out of your pocket plus another $13 per month for the programming guide and $4 per month for the rental of both cable cards which totals $17 per month while I'm paying just $20 per month now with nothing out of pocket? Plus TiVo said as long as I have their programming I get their product warranty. The thing is everytime something goes wrong it is $50 to exchange units plus you have to pay for shipping to send the unit to them which is roughly $15. With Cox all you have to do is exchange it. I would have given it a rating of 8 if I was comparing it to the Scientific Atlanta 8000HD since it had bugs galore. But as far as the main purpose of the DVR's go is to record programming and play it back, this makes the two units at a virtual dead heat. My recommendation is don't spend $500 if you don't have to, when all is said and done it is just a simple DVR.. 

$$;
Pros:. Support HDTV. 
Cons:. Picture does not fit screen. 
Summary:. I just set up my new plasma HDTV and Tivo. After a brutal time working with COMCAST, Tivo finally works......but wait I cannot see banners at the top of bottom. I called Tivo and they said this is a known problem and they are working on a solution.. When will a software update be available?. Big disappointment for a device this expensive.. This is not ready for prime time.. Richard.

Pros:. Finally to production.. 
Cons:. Too late to production.. 
Summary:. I was an early adopter of TiVo and enjoyed their first-to-market product for a short while before discovering third-to-market UltimateTV. Though it had a superior interface (PIP while using menu, more features, etc.) and data capabilities (guide downloads from a satellite instead of TiVo's telephone-based 1200 baud modem), UltimateTV's pursuit of market share was abandoned. TiVo seemed to learn nothing from the competition. I wonder whether they actually think they won against Replay and UltimateTV. In any case, TiVo's late-to-market HD Series 3 DVR probably represents their last ditch effort to reverse the erosion of their marketshare from the myriad of generic DVRs surrounding them. TiVo's GUI and basic functioning are essentially unchanged. The added features are poorly explained and not easy to implement. TiVo missed the opportunity to educate consumers on the benefits of home media networking with Series 2. Ah well, TiVo's passage into history will be their reward for complacency. For those of you with enough discretionary income to purchase one, think of it this way--when the next generation of HD DVRs come out, this TiVo Series 3 DVR will make nice company with your retired HD CRT flat screen in one of your guest rooms. -JD Megargel. 

$$;
Pros:. TiVo software and interface. 
Cons:. $1000 plus monthly cable card rental. 
Summary:. First, a disclaimer: As much as I expected to purchase one as soon as it was announced, I do not own this product. My current DVR, a Scientific Atlanta DVR (rented monthly from Time Warner for $8.95) is buggy and crashes as often as version 1 of a Microsoft software release, and the software/interface is nowhere near as nice as TiVo's. I have been waiting quite some time for the Series 3, but now that it is here, it is too late, costs too much and offers too little. Too late: people waited ages for an HD TiVo and finally went ahead and got DVRs from their cable co.'s so they could actually enjoy their HD plasma and LCD TVs. It is already installed, works (more or less) and the montly cost is under $10, which really is not too painful on a monthly basis. Too much: Now we are being asked to pay $1000 (if you are lucky enough to have been a TiVo subscriber when lifetime plans were offered) plus the monthly cable card rental fee that will still be necessary to rent two cable cards (another $5.50 a month from Time Warner). Too little: Even with the cable cards, still no PPV or On Demand available, and also minus many Series 2 features. Even assuming that an "average" user would have this TiVo for 4 years (which is probably too long) that would mean paying three times as much per month for TiVo as we are paying now for the cable box -- and having to pay most if it up front. If TiVo really wants people to give up their low cost cable provided DVRs and switch back to TiVo, it is going to have to drop the price on these to make it somewhat more comparable to what we are now paying for the cable co. DVR. I'd pay $399 (or maybe even a little more) for the box, and the $200 to transfer my lifetime membership, but $799 is just too much to ask for this product at this time..

Pros:. Tivo interface. 
Cons:. $$$upfront, $$mo. to tivo, $$ mo. to cable company. 
Summary:. Lets see, for $ 800.00+tax you get a hard drive (250GB). For 13.00+tax mo you get the TVIO programming. For 20.00?? mo. you get two DCR ver 1.1 cable card/tuners from the cable company. You can timeshift, but you can not archive. You don't get a IEEE1394 to archive to DVCR. You can't archive to HD-DVD. You will never, never (say it 'never') be able to archive (HiDef) period!, thanks to the MPA. Costs aside, this is only a slight improvement from the DirectTV HR 10-250, introduced two years ago. You're better off if you had purchased the Pioneer DVR-810H Series 2 with the ability to archive to DVD, and lifetime TIVO service. Is it just me, or does it appear that innovative technology has come to a screeching halt!. Maybe we should all just drop our Direct TV and cable subscriptions, refuse to buy/rent DVD's, or go to movies. Just kick the habit. Better off going outside in the sun and getting some exercise. (IMHO). 

$$;
Pros:. TiVo functionality is definitely the BEST feature of any DVR system.. 
Cons:. Outrageously expensive - a deal breaker.. 
Summary:. $799 for a DVR - even a TiVo DVR is incredibly insane. And the rumor about transferring an existing lifetime subscription is true - but that costs an additional $199, so that's $998 to replace my Series2 with this device. I'd rather get a new "regular" dual tuner device, and with the money I save I can pay for my monthly subscription for "life". This is NOT a good way to win over new customers, and certainly not a good deal at all for existing customers.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love TiVo. My Series 2 is still going strong and this one worked great for about 2 years.. 
Cons:. Now this machine is constantly freezing up and not working well with the cards. I've had the cards replaced by the cable company but it hasn't helped much. The shows are often scrambled now both when recording and watching it live.. 
Summary:. For the amount of money you pay for this machine, I do not recommend it. My Series 2 was by Humax and was great but this is so disappointing. I want TiVo because I love it but I don't want to shell out this much money every few years.. 

$$;
Pros:. worked great. 
Cons:. only worked for a week.. 
Summary:. Bought for 399 with rebate; broke after a week.. My last Tivo is 4 years old and still works great. I bought the 299 hd with fewer hours instead.. Last chance, then I switching to something else.. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally dual tuner Tivo with HD - just like your cable company. 
Cons:. No Multi-Room Viewing, No Remote Scheduling, No Tivo-to-go. 
Summary:. I ordered the Series 3 as soon as it came out, and after over 3 months I have been disappointed at almost ever turn.. I got my first Tivo in 2001, and thought it was the best thing ever. I've purchased several more though out the years including a Pioneer with a DVD burner that cost over $1,000 at the time, so the price is not really an issue.. It is the lack of basic features. You do not expect the Series 3 to have LESS capability then the Series 2, but amazingly that is what you get with this product.. When I finally got the unit up and running, the first thing you notice is that the channels turn much slower then with either the TWC HD DVR Box, or with a Series 2 and an IR connection to a standard cable box.. The second bonus that you get with this configuration is that the sound cuts out when watching non-HD channels. 8 cable cards later - TWC blames Tivo, Tivo blames TWC.. Forgetting about that for a second, just look at the feature one would expect to get for an $800 purchase, but are inexplicably missing:. Mulit-room viewing - I read somewhere that that was a concession that Tivo gave into to allow the licsensing of the cable card technology. The Series 3 should at least allow you to view shows recorded on a networked Series 2 box, but you can't even do that.. Remote Scheduling - on of the big things that the Tivo Web Site plays up is the ability to program your Tivo from anywhere. If you hear about a show and have not set it to record on your Tivo just go to the Tivo Web Site sign in and tell it to record. Yahoo! has a clearer way to do this from their TV Listings page that is really slick. BUT IT DOES NOT WORK WITH THE SERIES 3 BOX! This is really a case of false advertising in my opinion.. Finally, the Tivo-To-Go component, which allows you to download recorded shows to your PC (Not your Apple which has been promised for years, btw), works like a champ with the Series 2 but is not available for the Series 3.. Never would I have imagined a technology company coming out with a new product that offered less features then the predeccessor.. Sure the Tivo interface is slick, but it is not worth $800 more then the DVR box offered by your cable company.. Think long and hard before making this purchase. The features simply aren't there to justify this price.. 

$$;
Pros:. HDTV, picture quality, dual recording, ease of use (in theory). 
Cons:. Price, removal of functions, bugs bugs bugs. 
Summary:. I dove in and bought an HD Tivo because Tivo made a limited time offer to let lifetime subscribers bump their lifetime service to an HD Tivo. I paid a lot for that priveledge and have been "rewarded" with a unit that feels like it is still in beta testing. I liked that the unit used cable cards meaning no cable box is needed. Only it turns out cable cards are, at this point, iffy tech to say the least. In 3 months the cable people have had to be out almost 10 times. The Tivo also had a run of channels it just could not tune in on one tuner. So if you scheduled a record on one of these channels, whether you got it was a crap shoot on if Tivo chose to use the right tuner. I thought this was a cable card problem but, turns out, it is a problem with the the Tivo tuner itself.. While on the cable card, as a hardware issue, the cable card ejection buttons are such low grade plastic affairs that almost immediately one of them broke requiring you then to use pliars to extract the card.. Things kept going wrong with the Tivo itself or with the cable cards requiring frequent reboots or requiring redoing guided setup. And after those the Tivo would almost always forget the channel lineup settings. So after every frequent reboot you need to go in and channel by channel say, yes I get this one, no I don't get that one.... My Tivo has now reached the point where it is just plain broken. It won't load up the lineups properly. When I reboot it will start into a cycle of rebooting over and over.. It could be that I just got a lemon but I really feel like it was not a lemon when I got it but just... degraded quickly. Like if you can get it up and running right away you're fine but if you have to reboot and such, each reboot is one step closer towards it falling apart.. Also very disappointed on the online support. Got troubles with HD Tivo, questions, Tivo online offers little support and few answers. Mostly you are directed to the Tivo community forums where you still don't see much help but more just other people floundering for help and advice that isn't forthcoming.. And, not in question, for the extra money you pay you get less functionality. Series 3 HD Tivo does NOT support the ability to transfer shows to your computer and/or Ipod type devices, a function available on the cheaper and more reliable Series 2 Tivos. So even if your HD Tivo works great you still get less functionality for the extra cash.. I would give this unit a 1 rating really. I am giving it a couple extra points based on my faith in Tivo - who up until now I have thought was a solid and helpful company - and the hope that maybe, MAYBE I just got a lemon. But from the online Tivo forums it sounds like there are lots of HD Tivos that are lemons.. 

$$;
Pros:. All the good stuff that comes with Tivo boxes. Tivo interface, network capabilities, dual tuners.. 
Cons:. The price! Limited storage for HD, considering the price. limited comercial skip feature.. 
Summary:. I had heard rumors that the price was going to be around $800 for this. I dismissed them as lunacy, considering competitor pricing, present and near future, is quite a bit lower.. For $800, I would expect at least 1TB of storage to compensate for the extra needed for HD. My wife and I would burn through 32hrs in a matter of weeks.. I guess I'll wait until a cable HD tuner is available to build out a mythTV HD box. That would cost me about the same, but with much more storage and features.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD and Dual Tuners. 
Cons:. Price, Cable Only, No Lifetime. 
Summary:. My series 2 Tivo was one of the best technology investments I have ever made. It dramatically changed how I watched TV. However despite the initial excitement of a HD Tivo I wont be purchasing a series 3. I use internet based TV (AMINO Box) that doesnt support cable card, which means Im out of luck in the first place. The high price and lack of a lifetime contract option seals the deal. The series 3 may appeal to a small group of die-hard fans, but I think it missed the mark for the general population. Something Tivo cant afford to do at this point. Luckily AMINO is working on a HD based DVR that will come free with my service. The same is true for many Cable and Satellite customers as well. Plus no TivoToGo means this product is a NoGo for me!. 

$$;
Pros:. love my tivo. 
Cons:. cost of product. 
Summary:. I have a hugh's tivo and won't change for a long time.With direct tv no need for hd right now.I have a 42 inxh maganovox and a great picture from them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Two tuner HD, better looking unit, backlit remote. 
Cons:. There's only one you need to know: PRICE!. 
Summary:. TIVO has unbelievable nuts if they think this will hit big. Yes, you will have people that will go out and get it because they have the money. But most people don't have this kind of dough laying around. If they don't change the price, etc. then this could really hurt TIVO financially. This new TIVO unit has a lot in common with the BMW M5.....they're both getting smashing reviews but it doesn't matter because I can't afford either one! Think of what $800 (plus subscription fees) can buy. Just nuts I tell you!. I have had my Series 2 since they first came out. Got a lifetime subscription and was loving it. Then HD comes along and I buy a new LCD TV. Time Warner gave me an HD DVR box free for a few months and I was hooked. You can't beat recording in HD.. Now TIVO comes along WAAAYYY later than they should have been and gives us this. Price it at $400 to $500 and I might consider it IF you let me transfer my lifetime subscription for free. But $800 plus $199 to transfer my lifetime subscription? Seriously TIVO are you NUTS??? No way in heck I would pay a grand just for this. For a grand I could get the Time Warner DVR for at least 7 years, if not longer, and by that time I'm sure there will be better options anyway. No tivo to go just stinks too.. Tivo you know I love you....but I have to leave you....but this time I'm not the problem in the relationship....it's YOU!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use remote. Decent interface. 
Cons:. Does not support 802.11n WiFi. Streaming is slow and sporadic.. Slow to support external drives. Low quality of technical support. Requires additional machine and service contract for each TV you want to use.. VERY VERY EXPENSIVE SERVICE PLANS!!!. 
Summary:. There is an UGLY surprise waiting for early TIVO Series 3 customers! When that $300 3-year contract that you added to your $800 DVR runs out: LOOK OUT! You are back at square one on TIVO service pricing.. You will then have to buy the same new service contract as a new customer. TIVO didn't have a machine-lifetime service package back when you bought your $800 TIVO DVR so you bought the 3-year, $300 service package. Now, with competition from "free" DVRs bundled into your cable service, TIVO sells a machine-lifetime service plan for $400, just $100 more than their old 3-year service plan.. But to purchase that machine-lifetime subscription for your three-year-old machine, you have to pay the same price as a new customer buying that TIVO service for his brand new machine. That means machine-lifetime service for your TIVO Series 3 will end up costing you $700 where the customer buying a brand new machine today is paying $400 for that same service. That old TIVO Series 3 you rushed out to buy, will end up costing you a total of $1,500 ($800 for the machine plus $700 for the TIVO service).. Meanwhile, the new customer is getting his new TIVO HD DVR for less than $300 and his service package for $400. His HD machine and service will cost him less than $700. Your machine and service will cost you more than twice as much. Thanks TIVO. Way to take care of your loyal early-adopters. Doesn't make you want to rush out and buy a new TIVO DVR does it?. Watch out for another major TIVO gotcha. That lifetime TIVO service product you might decide to buy cannot be rolled over to a new machine. When your current machine is no longer viable or you decide to go to satellite TV, you will forfeit your whole investment and be back at square one, buying a new machine and a new service plan.. 

$$;
Pros:. A great high end device. 
Cons:. Will be able to rent from Comcast soon!. 
Summary:. For those who don't know Tivo has licensed their software to Comcast and they are currently testing an HD PVR/cable box! You will probably be able to rent one of these (or something very similar) from Comcast within a year. But I guess if you really need the THX sound go ahead and spend your $800. I'll just wait.. 

$$;
Pros:. A dream machine, superior to any DVR on the market. 
Cons:. NOT compatible with Directv or Dish Network.. 
Summary:. His incompatibility with the satellite networks will make it a loser. What a shame !!!. 

$$;
Pros:. None that I can see. 
Cons:. No HD recording. 
Summary:. No where near as good as my Dish HD PVR 622!. 

$$;
Pros:. Duel tuner, record HD programs. 
Cons:. $800, plus monthly fee.. 
Summary:. I am long time Tivo user and it's a bit hard for me to give a bad rating to this slick new Tivo product. But wait, for $800, are you kidding me? I agree with other reviewers that you can just about buy a PC for this price. So to Tivo, what are you smoking? I'd like some of that..... 

$$;
Pros:. it's High Defintion. 
Cons:. no multiroom configuring for playback of recorded video EXPENSIVE!. 
Summary:. 3 time is a charm? Not THis Product! Yah think they would get it right. Everyone wants to watch their own Shows. When I come home for work I want to watch my missed programming. The Ms. and the kids want to watch their's. Only can watch it on one set. Still have to use a video splitter for multiple rooms. It's not Rocket Science what people want! Put multiplt outputs on the box with the campability for playback respective to multiple viewing of different recorded programming in different rooms!. Gesus... get it right on the 4th PLEASE!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nearly as good as the cable box I get for $10/mo. 
Cons:. No DVD player/burner, no PIP, no PPV or VOD. 
Summary:. This product is lame. I have a Series 2 that I bought from Humax directly that has a DVD burner. It's a great feature and allows you to replace the DVD player with the tivo box, saving some real estate and eliminating one remote control. I also have a Cablevision HD Box which has two tuners (record two shows and watch a third), PIP, gets PPV and VOD, works on HDMI or component inputs, etc. This product is a step back from the basic offering from the outdated cable company! If this is where TiVo is leading its customers, short the stock while you still can!. 

$$;
Pros:. Dual Tuner, HD, 2 years too late. 
Cons:. The price is higher than a pc. 
Summary:. I once swore by Tivo. Have a lifetime membership on the first model. Then I saw a demonstration for a PC based TV control program. For $80 (software + PCI card) I've been able to record HDTV signals with minimum effort. The interface on the program is as good or better than Tivo. I can take the files anywhere I want, even my PDA since the recorded files are transcoded to standard WMV (I can also use divx).. So question is, should I dump my previous one just to get this functionality in a closed box? For $800 I can get a new PC with 19" LCD monitor, slap in four tuners in it and go crazy. Let's leave this for people with too much money and too little access to drugs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Originally easy to use, seemed like a good investment. 
Cons:. Problems from the beginning, not compatible with cable company, lack of customer service. 
Summary:. The issues began about 2 months into owning our TiVo with tilling of the picture, loss of sound, and freezing. When we contacted TiVo, they blamed the cable company. After 6 months of constant complaints and having the cable company to our house for service calls, we finally decided to replace everything. TiVo would not replace our DVR without $150 fee. We willing paid the fee and hoped for the best. There were several issues with transferring saved recorded shows from the old DVR to the new DVR, but once it was said and done, we didn't have any problems.. After 90 days with the replacement TiVo the hard drive "crashed". We lost access to the TV the TiVo was hooked up to, all the shows previously recorded and any programs saved (along with movies purchased that had not been viewed). The company was not concerned with our troubles, nor when we explained our unhappiness and desire to move on from TiVo, the loss of our business. This was a complete waste of our money and time. We did not find TiVo to be anything more that a regular DVR that gave us more headaches than pleasure.. 

$$;
Pros:. User interface.. 
Cons:. Slow response between clicks.. Hidden one year contract for monthly service charge -- early termination fee will be a year's cost of subscription, minus what you have already paid for. I found that out the hard way. :(. 
Summary:. Do not get a Tivo unless you have to.. Check for alternatives before buying and signing up for Tivo services.. I got ATT U-verse. It can record 4 shows at the same time (3 HD, 1 SD). User interface is just about as good. No need to pay for device, and monthly fee is just about what I would pay for Tivo service. Best part, no contract with the service I got from ATT. Think about it, no contract from a phone company!. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything I've Waited For. 
Cons:. Too expensive - Tivo: are you out of your minds?. 
Summary:. I absolutely love my series 2 and can't imagine life without it. But there is no way that I am paying $800 for the series3 AND pay $13/mth (or the $199 to xfer my lifetime from series2). Tivo: you are out of your minds! I would consider $400 and FREE transfer of lifetime, but no way at your pricepoint. Plus, "Get rid of your cable box"? Big deal! So I exchange my cable boxes for cable cards? Still paying the cable company the rental fees. And now I can't watch PPV or OnDemand unless I keep a cable box? So I'm paying TWC more? No thanks..
