0 out of 5 stars gives strange directions, july 6, 2009

when it comes to directions, i'm horrible .

directions routing are perfect .

directions were easy to see and understand .

spoken directions are crystal clear .

my new garmin 255w had very easy set up, accurate directions to locations, user friendly unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .

the directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .

several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .
