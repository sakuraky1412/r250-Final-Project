their is nothing to say but the iphone 4 is the best phone in the world  .
it's an iphone    which by now is a reliable and known quantity  .
i do not know anyone who has one who wants to trade one , and for most users the lack of multitasking is no big deal (it's a smart phone , not a tiny pc)  .
droid is getting the market share nowadays , but iphone still is a pleasure to use  .
i consider myself a user for life .
it is easy for this old man to use and lessen's my load when i travel  .
i can use it without all the mess of a lap top when i am going on a trip on my motorcycle  .
i find it very easy to use and do all my banking on it and pay , or check my accounts  .
this is a great phone , and if you have the opportunity to get your haands on one , go for it  .
(i have one , and i will also be getting the iphone 4g as soon as it comes out as well) it is by far the best mobile that is currently on offer , and i can see the 4g carrying on that legacy .
updated  .

does a great job of maintaing the line between fun and media too productivity and business  .
i'll be looking 4ward too the 4g in a month or so .
iphone has really changed the smartphone market  .
everyone tried to copy it , yet fail  .
people who yell that 'iphone sucks' just hate the apple's success and never used an iphone .
this is a great phone worth buying .
i read a great article about how 40% of blackberry users are going to switch this summer to the iphone 4g  .
here is the article   http  //cnmnewsnetwork  .
com/13275/iphone    4g    and    iphone    4    0    release    date    40    blackberry    users    would    switch/  .
iphone 4g and iphone 4  .
0 release date    40% blackberry users would switch  .
a blackberry is among the most popular business phones on the market  .
all that could change , and a major survey recently indicated that a whopping 40% of current blackberry users would switch to iphone upon the 4g release this is bad news for rim , the maker of the popular blackberry  .
the phone  .
s saving grace is that the iphone is currently only available via at t , whereas every major cell phone provider carries one form of blackberry or another the apple iphone release date is rumored to be sometime this summer  .
an exact date has not been given by apple , although the phone is expected to hit the stores sometime in june or july  .
even though the hype is growing , it is noted that the iphone has security issues that aren  .
t present in the other smartphone handset  .
this could inspire many companies to keep requiring blackberries in order to keep their data safe in addition to the iphone 4  .
0 , the ipad is another hot apple item  .
the 3g version of the tablet is available late in april , while the wifi only version is available april 3  .
the unit looks kind of like an overblown iphone , and many are skeptical that it will be as popular as its hype .
the iphone is a great phone  .
from the physical design to the software , the iphone is a well refined phone  .
the ease of use is one of the best parts of the phone  .
with the iphone you just do , you do not have to think about it  .
the iphone can be picked up by anyone , and they could learn how to use the phone within a few minutes  .
one of it's biggest plus's though , is the app store  .
with thousands of developers , the capabilities for apps are endless  .
without the iphone , apps would not be as we know them today  .
the iphone set the groundwork for apps in phones , and truly has changed the smartphone industry  .
another groundbreaking movement started by the iphone is design  .
before the iphone , design is of least concern by manufactures  .
however the iphone is not without it's faults  .
the camera could be improved , as well as an addition of a flash to the camera  .
also , the placement of the water sensors , are truly ineffective  .
they are placed with the headphone jack , and the dock connector , and is exposed to the exterior environment , often in    correctly setting of the sensor with the smallest of rain drops , or even humidity  .
also , there should be a multi carrier platform , at t has a great 3g network , but that is if you can get a signal  .
lastly , flash support  .
while not of major concern , it would certainly be a great addition to the phones already awesome browser .

i see all the iphone bashing going on in these reviews and most of it is from folks who have never used one as a business tool like i do  .
i is a loyal blackberry user for years before making the switch to apple and i have never looked back  .
i have also converted my office from the pc and windows world to mac os and that is the best business decision i have made in years i have tried other phones with android , windows mobile and they all fall short  .
i hate to say this but the google email and calendar functions are much nicer and streamlined on the iphone then on the google phones  .
i will say that apple needs to make improvements in the multitasking and allow the end user to set up the phone the way they would like it to look instead of the one way approach they currently have in place they have become a 50 billion dollar company because they build stuff people want and they stand behind what they build  .
i would love to see apple just make a phone that any carrier can use and quit lining themselves up with one carrier  .
i hate at t because they nickel and dime me to death and with all the cell phones and portable internet devices out there , there is no reason any carrier should be charging more the 79  .
00 for everthing period and they would still make a fortune as to all the iphone haters and bashers out there , keep you second rate devices and i will keep on using my world class phone and enjoy it everytime someone ask me is that the iphone and i proudly say yes it is .
i used my phone unhacked for months and finally got sick of being restricted by stupid apple restrictions if it was not for the jailbreaking community i would like this phone but it would not be nearly as perfect  .
people complain about signal but i generally have strong signals when my friends have very low or none every thing that is customizable on it , i have a personalized theme and background all my settings are configurable and sbprefs allows me to toggle almost anything i want instantly , edge , 3g , bluetooth , brightness , processes , ssh , wi    fi , autolock , rotation its perfect  .
i recommend it to any iphone owner  .
having had blackberry 8900 for almost an year and switched to iphone , i gotta admit the better user experience iphone offers  .
to start off , the software iphone uses is very straight forward and almost never lags  .
everything is streamlined and runs smoothly  .
for the same $30 dollars a month for unlimited data plan , i get way more out of my iphone than a blackberry  .
there is simply so much more to do on iphone  .
at the time i switched to iphone there are many other choices out there with better hardware  .
but , for a consumer that does not know a tad about hacking , i believe the usability or a phone is way more important than raw tech spec  .
iphone have over 100 , 000+ (and growing) applications in their app store , most of them are cheaply priced or free  .
i also love the fact that iphone receives a system update every year or so  .
with all the available applications and new updates for its software , iphone is a phone you grow with , not out of .
im sorry but anyone giving a piece of technology this unbelievable needs their head read  .
evrything is amazing right now and nobody is happy louis ck  .
it is a mini laptop  .

if you hate yourself and your neighbors then you can probably hate on the iphone too  .
but really who gives a crap about the cons , just buy the phone and throw your worries away forever  .
the best phone there is yet  .
with the voice control , i never seen any cellphone with that function , i like it , and any more , its design and interface is very good  .
in fact , http  //www  .
cellphone    china  .
com is a good cellphone website , i think that is very good choose for you .
before i got mine , i is skeptical about the iphone , but once i got it , i is blown away by the features  .
enough of the bad talk about the iphone for reasons of call quality and coverage , thats the network , not the phone  .
i could not imagine a better phone .
the apple iphone continues to be the phone by which all other smart phones are compared  .
most of the negative reviews you see here will be from pre or android users  .
the iphone is still the phone that does the basics in a world class fashion and adds to the experience like only apple can (bt , wifi , apps , etc)  .
don't worry much about what you read about the iphone not being able to multi    task it can and it does multi    task  .
there are core apps (like phone  .
app , etc) that are consistently running in the background  .
you can access another app while on a call and not loose the phone call  .
so it is constantly multi    tasking the core apps , and also lets you access apps while on a phone call  .
what it does not do is let you control what multi    tasks       i have yet to see a need to do this , and am happy my phone does it for me .
the phone is amazing  .
the carrier so so much .
it is a perfect gadget  .
it is useful for all    buisness , personal , entertainment  .
very handy and unique .
i switched from a motorola razr to the iphone 3gs 16gb so you should have an idea of the leap in technology i experienced with the iphone  .
a gigantic leap  .
this phone is very easy to use  .
i text a lot so i is looking forward to using the qwerty keyboard on the iphone  .
once i got the hang of it , the keyboard is very easy to use  .
i'm a facebook fanatic so the fb application is very cool to use  .
as a matter of fact , the iphone facebook app is the main reason why i bought this phone  .
i'm still learning the phone since i've only had it for 2 weeks now (28nov09)  .
but so far i am very , very happy with this phone  .
i've heard negative things about the call quality , but i have not experienced it  .
the call quality that i've experienced has been very good clear  .
the headphone that comes with the iphone is not bad both for listening to music and talking hands free  .
i highly recommend the iphone 3gs .
absolutely love this phone  .
very intuitive and everything works all the time  .
my husband has verizon and i have at t wireless  .
between the two our service is pretty much the same  .
the call quality on my iphone is superb  .
i upgraded from a motorola that supposedly is reviewed for excellent call quality and everyone tells me that the new iphone is much better and that is in rural nh with limited service  .
all the applications are just awesome  .
the phone is easy to adapt to and it just does everything it is supposed to and then some  .
great quality construction  .
i is so happy with this phone i switched from a pc and purchased a macbook pro  .
i'm apple all the way now and one happy camper  .
iphone is great  .
at t is unfornuately the worst cell provider to have chosen to pair up with  .
apple should go with another cell provider , or their product will suffer because of it's dependancy on at t my experience    .
all of at t coverage maps show downtown chicago as 100% coverage for edge and 3g  .
this is not the case  .
i get dropped calls 50% of the time , no exageration  .
i cannot use the phone anywhere above the 10th floor of any building in the city , which at t says is normal  .
however , i previously had verizon , and never experienced this type of cell dropout  .
at t is clearly lying about cell coverage , and any time i call to complain , they just say you are wrong , our maps show full coverage in that area  .
honestly , i really like the iphone  .
it does just about everything  .
it connects you to all the facets of your life  .
i have the 32gig 3g    s  .
i feel that it's extremely fast , especially over wi    fi  .
but all i have to compair it to is all the junky verizon phones i've had  .
they were so slow and aggrevating  .
the iphone seems so far ahead of all the competition both in ease of use and speed  .
it really is a palm computer  .
now , if you are talking trends , iphone downloads music , crazy easy  .
i mean , it's an ipod  .
itunes is the mother of all download services  .
no one does it better  .
the camera is darn right good as well  .
while 3 mp is not earth shattering , it's still very good  .
in fact , i'd say the picture's are printable  .
the video quality is extremely good as well  .
there is such a huge support market for this advanced piece of art  .
when they say there's an app for that , they mean everything  .
banking on line , ebay , amazon , games , gps , stocks , spell check , news , an app to show you excactly where you parked , weather and my favorite , dozens of resturaunt guides  .
what ever your interests are , there's probably an app  .
your iphone is capable of being personalised by you , in more ways than i could possibly know  .
each one of these portholes (apps) , are just that  .
the droid might be a worthy phone , but , i doubt it has the support infastructure of the iphone  .
this is not a phone  .
this is a sophisticated hand held computer with a phone built in if you want a well constructed , beautifully designed , fast , multifunctional , device then the iphone is for you  .
if you dont care about these things and want a cheap phone go to sprint  .
warning these devices are addicting and you will find yourself buying all of apple products after using an iphone or ipod  .
remember i warned you .
work home club bar kitchen travel , car , , grandmas , , , this works everywhere , along with all of apples accessories and all the hack    a    ble solutions , , , g sus phone i coined that  .
lol  .
everything works intuitively  .
the i    phone does everything , but you do not have to learn how to use it  .
it is truly a computer in my pocket  .
web access is as good as my desk top , zoom is so easy , no matter where i am the internet is with me  .
e    mail is great , i erase them as they come , no 10 , 000 unread e    mails on my computer  .
phone works great , speakerphone is fine , visual voicemail is great , texting is great  .
no signal problems for me , so far better than verizon , i'm in la , oc area so others might have problems , but i have had none  .
oh yea , i almost forgot its an i    pod too  .
great photo editing app , push    up app , calorie monitoring app , weight monitoring app  .
upc reading app , photo document scanning app , daily spending app  .
camera takes real photos  .
i market citrus to national grocery chains , used to have to take pictures in cooler download and e    mail  .
now i take the picture edit and e    mail on the spot , incredible  .
i have had no battery problem  .
the a/c adapter just plugs into the wall , get a ups extension , keep it plugged in at desk or car updated  .
on oct 15 , 2009  .
this is my 3rd iphone , and simply the best one  .
i should of waited for this one the 3gs  .
i am so pleased with all it can do  .
i cannot get over the fact it is a mini tablet in the palm of your hands for so little money  .
i am getting 3 days now out of the battery compared to 1 day with the old 3g  .
which i sold on craigs list for $400 it is so much faster and responsive  .
i did several side by side test with the 3g and 3gs  .
the results were not even close  .
3gs makes browsing the web like using your laptop with broadband  .
starting a game like ferrari gt is 8 times faster and no in game lag  .
turning on the phones is like night and day  .
the 3gs is so fast i is surfing the web while the older 3g is still loading  .
gps worked so much quicker and more responsive  .
i have no complaints at all with this new 3gs model my only gripe is the people who give negative reviews  .
why didn't you return the phone if you are negative  .
i know i would have if i is not happy with it just got to love 600mhz processor and 256mb of ram and the new itunes cover flow for the iphone apps is simply easy did you know the iphone 3gs is also a text reader  .
in the settings under general click on accessibility and click on voice over  .
this is so damn neat  .
maybe you wo not want it on all the time but if you have a long newspaper article or email to read why not let it be read to you  .
the handicap features are bar none to any other device  .
apple thought of everything here you can even change the appearance using accessibility  .
pretty damn cool and how many products are still worth a good chunk of change when you own them  .
go to ebay or craigs list and see what they are selling for if you decide you want to get out of it .
new features such as video and voice control along with the speed boost make the 3gs a great upgrade .
i love the touch , the feel , the fabric of our lives  .
but seriously folks , this is a solid classy phone  .
every feather is well thought out  .
i love the way it feel in my suit coat  .
none of that silly hooking it to your belt crap holder and stuff  .
just pull it in your suit coat or pant pocket or blue jeans and you are good to go  .
i love it  .
i get my news , daily stock quotes , and email on the go  .
i like that i can read ebooks and kindle books on my phone  .
with documents to go , i have the entire microsoft suite on my handheld  .
i can sync my contacts and calendars and have then withme  .
i like that if i lose my phone , i can remotely wipe it clean if there is no hope of finding it with mobile me technology  .
i like the navigation capabilities  .
it's great that i can now get live or recorded tv broadcasts with the updated eye tv app  .
yahoooo there are just so many things that i can do with my 3gs iphone , and do them well  .
if i forget it on the way to work , i feel incomplete and lost  .
in my book , the iphone rocks .
the bottom line is once you tweak all the options to minimize battery drain the amount of time for active use and stand by is totally accurate  .
i used apple's site and their tips and it works like a charm  .
if you're still complaining about your battery life then you're doing something wrong , not the phone .
awesome phone  .
way to go for all phones .
okay , so i is able to pick up my apple iphone 3g s 16gb from jab cellular (http  //www  .
jabcellular  .
com) it is factory unlocked , brand new  .
this means that it came from the manufacture , unlocked version 3  .
0 os direct link to the product is   http  //www  .
jabcellular  .
com/apple    iphone    16gb    unlocked    p    61  .
html you can get black or white , and they also have additional product options  .
i absolutely love my phone , and loved the service from jab cellular  .
i will definitely be returning to jab cellular in the future a+  .
just a brief story i is with sprint for 5 years and always had their top of the line phone all of the htc's , and pda's , and i always had to return them in for some defect that i found on the phone when my ipod is stolen i decided to leave sprint for the iphone 3gs to combine my ipod feature and phone together and oh boy that is the best move ever i remember when i first got this phone about 3 months ago i is telling everyone about all of the features it has its definitely the best phone out there  .
its super fast , doesnt even feel like you have a phone closing and opening app are easy , now with the new update mms picture mail is soooooo cool and practical no need logging to the net to see you photo or video , you receive them as a text and you can give your phone#@mms  .
att  .
net to your friends and receive emails instantly like the blackberry in the form of a text there's just sooo much you can do  .
i have a program that monitors my calories and sets a goal for me for christ sake  .
you cant go wrong with this  .
if you feel that 299  .
00 is too much to spend , then pay for the 16gig the only downfall with this phone and that i'm scared of is , there is no insurance plan if its lost or stolen  .
(one thing i will miss from sprint)  .
and the reception can be a tad bit better  .
but the good definitely out ways the bad  .
dont think about it , if you dont have it yet get it  .
what are you waiting for  .
overall i love this phone , i got it this past week and it has made my life so much easier  .
i am able to look things up quickly , i have games to always play , i am able to email my coworkers without any problem , and i do not have any calling problems  .
i do wish i could use the music that i already have in my itunes library as a ringtone without having to pay to make it that way , but other than that , i love this phone  .
wanna get a free iphone 3gs  .
it's really simple ,  .
go to xpango  .
com register there and type the referral id    91935437  .
c'mon just try it .
please let me start by saying unlike some other users reviews , this is of the iphone 3gs , not at t  .
if you dont like at t , leave and stop complaining about them on an iphone review  .
i just switched from another carrier to get the iphone 3gs because finally , the phone has the capabilities i wanted  .
this phone has pretty much everything you need in a smartphone  .
no , it does not multitask , but is fast enough to just close and open other apps back to back with no lag ( and most every app starts you right back where you were) unlike winmo phones , and the infamous palm pre , this phone has no lag that i have yet to find , does not need to be constantly reset , and pretty much everything electronic is ipod/iphone compatible , not htc or palm compatible  .
i believe palm is even try to leech off itunes , even after being blocked from syncing to it twice now  .
truth is , the phone is a great device , does email well , browser is wonderful , even the keyboard is great (and i came from a touch pro 2)  .
music capabilities on this phone are unsurpassed by any other phone i have used , moto q , htc touch , diamond , pro , and pro2  .
video on this phone is excellent (including the video recording  .
people complain about not being able to customize the phone  .
i is sick and tired of having to try to find roms for my winmo phones to make it faster , more stable , etc why would you want to customize the 3gs if it does everything already  .
the service costs a little more , but in my opinion , having a phone that does not constantly lock up , or need to be replaced due to faulty keyboards ( htc people you know who you are  .
) is worth the extra few $$ a month  .
i am not an apple fanboy , and hate macs , but have to admit this phone does everything i need , and does it very very well updated  .
on sep 22 , 2009  .
for me , this device is great  .
this is my first iphone so i cannot compare to the older models  .
this is also my first multi    use device that i actually bought a dataplan for  .
so far i love it and have not found anything wrong software wise the apple connector bugs me because it's much larger than it needs to be  .
if you look inside the connector itself you'll see that it only uses 5 of the pins  .
a much smaller connector could have been used and the remaining room could have been enough to accomodate a microsd expansion slot jailbreaking the iphone imo is completely worth it  .
it solves the but apple restricts the apps you can download arguement and it is completely reversable and will not 'brick' your iphone the only other gripe i have is that it is pretty fragile and a simple small drop could easily crack the screen  .
i solved this by getting an otterbox case for the ultimate protection  .
it makes the size much larger but being that i'm used to the size of a t    mobile wizard , i think i can live with it .
just about everything on this phone is amazing , the only real downfalls are the battery life and possibly the voice control , which is not as acurate as i would have liked it to be , as far as battery life goes , my 32gig 3gs model lasted an entire day of heavy usage , when you consider that the largest draw on any phones battery is the screen and the radios , and this phone has a massive touchscreen and just about every radio there is makes what battery life this does have actually quite impressive , as long as it lasts thriugh the day who cares  .
it's not like you use the phone as you sleep right  .
please do not take me to be one of those people who like apple just because they're apple , i'm actually a big microsoft fan , but apple put the best product out on the market and i think it's great , i would recomend it to anyone who can get the upgrade discount  .
to finish this off i would just like to say that i submitted this entire review on my iphone on at t's 3g network as easily as i would on regular computer  .
great great phone  .
the service from at t could be better , but overall , 5 stars  .
this phone does it all  .
my wife got the original iphone , then i got the 3g , then she got the 3gs  .
her brother got one , my sister got one , my sister's husband has one , everyone i know has one or is getting one  .
and once you own one , you will not want another phone .
i'm a big fan of my iphone , and so is everyone around me  .
i is on an unbeatable employee advantage deal with sprint and could never justify the crossover until my employee connection is laid off  .
once i realized i is paying a little over 60$ for kinda    wish    it    was    an    iphone , i is okay with just spending thirty extra a month  .
i live in columbus , oh , and the service has been fantastic  .
i'm moving to chicago in a few weeks and during my last trip there i noticed that the reception is fine , but the gps required just a wee bit more patience because of the tall buildings , and that i have no reception issues although i saw iphones everywhere i look for the deals , and for what the iphone provides me , the price    tag is not outrageous  .
but i make full use of employee discounts that are not advertised at all  .
i also think it's going to be a huge wake    up call when other carriers get the iphone  .
everyone will be happy because some people will be able to go with their preferred carrier , those who stay with at t will be able to breathe a little easier in bandwidth , and maybe , just maybe , the price tag will tumble a bit i'm optimistic it seems that people are just easily offended at what seems to be a logical issue  .
spread the load of the data to other carriers and everyone will be happy  .
when at t got the iphone i do not know if they knew they were signing up for such a deluge of customers  .
i can see them sitting in there offices sweating , praying , begging , somebody , please , design something better than this thing  .
make the iphone killer for jobs' sake  .
battery life is fine in mine  .
i took the bells and whistles down a bit , lowering the screen dimmer to 70% and turning off constant wi    fi  .
when i splurge , i need to recharge at the end of the day (but i'm actually at about 50% , so need to remarks to my own ocd  .
) under heavy usage , the iphone lasts as long as it should need to , and the chord is pretty portable anyways .
i is in the market for a phone that could offere me wifi  .
however , i did not want to purchase the data plan to be able to use the wifi option  .
therefore , i searched the net and is able to find a brand new , unlocked , iphone from http  //www  .
jabcellular  .
com they were awesome to work with , and i absolutely love the phone  .
nice job on this one apple  .
i did not get this to completely replace a pc , but to almost do it , and that is what it does  .
it allows me to keep up on my job hunt activities , help me watch my calorie intake  .
share moments with my family  .
keep me on track with my appointments  .
keep me entertained with my music library at my finger tips  .
also keep me entertained with the online access to audio streams of radio from around the world  .
keeps me informed when i am otherwise wasting time  .
and can be is turned off when i just want some peace  .
sometimes i use it with the meditation apps providing binural beats updated  .
on aug 31 , 2009  .
i've always been a tech junkie , especially when it comes to cell phones so i clearly know my fair share when it comes to technology  .
the iphone is hands down the most impressive phone on the market  .
it's text messaging and auto    correction system is perfect  .
over time it detects your spelling habits and adapts to them  .
if you modify the phone in certain ways the customization for it is ridiculous  .
you can do just about anything to it that you want without compromising the os  .
mms and tethering are finally available , but not on at t just yet    which has made me consider switching providers  .
as of recently the iphone is now extremely affordable , and realistically    there is really no reason to not buy this phone  .
you can get an iphone for $99 with a new contract which is less than some non    smart phones  .
i recommend this phone to every one of my friends and family members and i have never met a person who is disappointed with this phone .
wish i owned one sooner , had slower windows mobile phones ,  .
the iphone 3g s is fast , i like the full html browser  .
taking pics / video's and emailing them is extremely easy , the sound recorder picks up sound very well , the camera has good picture quality , google maps is rich and detailed  .
the apps are endless and the possibilities are endless as well updated  .
on aug 8 , 2009  .
its a huge improvement over my blackjack 2  .
first thing i noticed is the fact that when i text message , the keyboard doesnt leave out letters , no matter how fast i type  .
unlike my blackjack where every other letter is missing  .
overall this is a great phone , and the apps just make it that much cooler  .
the around me app is amazing when you are on vacation , or a mission trip and need to find a gas station or a restaurant  .
i would 100% recommend this phone to anyone  .
updated  .
on aug 8 , 2009  .
mobile of 2009  .
i avoided apple products since the original apple computer  .
i is a pc guy and built a 2500 song mp3 collection using a rio and later a zune  .
than i had the ultimate (mis) fortune    i won an apple touch as a door prize to a conference i is attending well it is free so i loaded itunes and got it up and running  .
within a few days my zune started to collect dust  .
two years later i had spent more than $800 on itunes and it doesn't stop there  .
a few days before the new apple 3gs is released i started at a new company and the standard company phone is from at t    i asked about the iphone and they said sure , if you can get one well thanks to the business rep at at t i got two 32 gig 3gs phones on opening day (say what verizon  .
your business reps cannot even show how to use voicemail)  .
one iphone for me for the business account and one for my wife (we ditched verizon    been with them since bell atlantic) and moved over to at t i have had the phone for a month and the luster hasn't worn off  .
sure i had an itouch so many features were the same  .
but the 3g network works great (in and around dc    not so much down at dewey beach , de)  .
i wrapped it in a rubber skin with a face shield and it is surviving the beating i am giving it ipod functions are as great as ever phone is good but the ringer is weak    so is my last blackberry  .
easy to configure email accounts to both hotmail and outlook exhange (much better than blackberry especially if your company doesn't have the $1000s in blackberry enterprise software)  .
the apps rock  .
espn scores , weatherbug , facebook , ebay , pizza hut ordering  .
the maps function is manna from heaven    the live traffic update is brilliant    i drove to the beach and ran into stop and go traffic  .
pulled up maps function and saw bad traffic ending after a mile and green the rest of the way  .
a mile later we had a easy drive to the beach    wow what a feature great texting interface    conversations    need i say more  .
awesome sounds in the car    run the stereo through the auxillary inputs and dang it sures sounds great    i played with the options on the harder tracks to boost the output and the truck is rocking  .
movies on planes    i do not care what seat they put me in  .
i put on a movie and that's 90 to 120 minutes i am obivious to the crummy world on modern jets google voice search    driving down the highway    say find mr wash    the website pops up and i konw the exit to turn on to get there bottom line    this is the most amazing handheld hardware in history  .
i had the palm v , the ipaq , blackberries and finally apple has invented the swiss army knife of handheld devices  .
others will immitate but for now there are no equals  .
and for your haters    i is you and i have seen the light on my iphone screen updated  .
on oct 8 , 2009  .
to me this is the greatest phone ever made and it will continue to be number 1 phone  .
i don't know why others gave this phone a 1 star , most likely these people are a bunch of haters because it's only out for at t users  .
at t has the number phone out and yes it is the apple iphone 3gs  .
i left sprint because i liked the apple iphone and the way it is built and the things that this phone can do  .
so far i don't see any other phone that can compare to this phone  .
as for the iphone being on at t ; at t is the best network in the us and out of the us so i do not know what people are talking about .
i liked the prodect because it gave me the infomation i needed to now about the phone and it told you how to work the phone so it made me take less time in my life to get comtherbale with the phone then i thought it would  .
besides if i did not find this phone on this website i would not of got this phone  .
i also got this phne because it is afordable and i did not have to brake the bank  .
i think you are doing an exelent job on this web site keep up the good work .
easily the best , most versatile mobile unit out there  .
best interface , best apps .
itune synch , app store , fast , clear audio , multimedia , exchange server compatability , video is great , camera is ok  .
did i mention its fast  .
i love this phone  .
both my wife and i purchased one and we find nothing to dislike  .
coverage seem good where we live and i believe att will build more towers to compete with verizon  .
if they went to verizon also i know phone sales would skyrocket because of the coverage issue since verizon got started alot sooner in the wireless market .
its a great phone , and unlike other phones i have had the software has evolved by leaps and bounds and will continue to do so  .
bottom line is that over all this is the best phone out there with a company that can back up the product  .
att needs to work harder on the service to keep up with the demand of the phone  .
push notification has solved the multitask problem in a better way  .
most reviews point to this device as number one .
i have tried other touch screen phones , and nothing come close  .
the reason for this is the applications available for the iphone  .
there really is an app for everything  .
also , multitasking on a phone is way overhyped due to immediate drain of battery with that feature .
because there are so many apps available , would like to see upgrades that will offer more organization for the numerous apps (folder tabs or button navigation)  .
the camera and video are enough for my portable needs (if i want to enter a photo contest i would use my dslr camera)  .
the phone feels good in my hand , whether i'm on a call , or accessing apps  .
the design and interface are stunning  .
overall , i think apple did an amazing job of integrating ease of use with sophisticated styling , although , at times one can argue that the ease    of    use unfairly trumps the technology that could be integrated into the phone  .
but , when all is said and done , i appreciate the though that goes into this 'less is more' (bauhaus    esque) design path the pros definitely outweigh the cons on this phone  .
it's great to have a quality device in my pocket with a visually pleasing design that allows me to carry my ipod , camera , video recorder , to do list , shopping list , web , reading library , gps , workout program , recipes , art , banking , and gaming oh , right       and a phone i never take the apple bashers very seriously  .
historically , apple has set the bar for affordable innovation and design in the computer industry  .
what follows are the critics , competitors , plagiarists , and whiners who thought innovation and style amounted to siting in front of a plastic beige box while typing with a neon green terminal font against a black background .
its makes me so mad that the cnet people keep marking it for having bad reception  .
that is not apples fault its at t's  .
and this is the best phone out there  .
its keeps making improvements but all cnet editors want is more  .
more more more  .
how can it not have the editors choice  .
because of the reception  .
complain some more cnet losers  .

although it's missing some features this iphone is the best one out their and the fastest , which makes the phone more enjoyable .
overall love it .
new customers should have no hesitation buying a 3gs  .
iphone 3gs offers a massive library of applications and a beautiful touch screen  .
simply there's no better smartphone out there today .
this is a must have for any apple lover .
awesome product  .
i switched to att just for this phone  .
the user interphase is flawless seemless and fluid  .
does everything i need and much more  .
i upgraded from a 2g iphone  .
i is reluctant at first , after reading random blogs about bad battery life , overheating , etc  .
i have had zero , read zero , problems with my 3gs  .
battery life is good , even when using 3g data and my phone has no problems with overheating or discoloration  .
in seattle , my 3g coverage is outstanding , no reception problems at all most of the time people will only take the time to post a review if there is something negative they want to get off their chest  .
well here i am with nothing to gain , posting a positive review  .
i love my iphone 3gs and am very happy i got it  .
i honestly do not think anything else compares .
i dont understand what you are saying about call quality or 3g reception i have had every iphone since the original and i never had call quality issues  .
i had some minor reception issues with the first iphone but that is not a big deal , since the 3g the reception became great and the 3gs is even better , i get 3g signals in places that my versizon friends and other people on att with other phones do not get any signal .
i've had this phone for several weeks now and as a first time iphone user , i couldn't be happier  .
i'm absolutely amazed at how easy everything is to use  .
texting is fantastic and the keyboard is extremely responsive and makes typing very easy  .
i've had a blackberry curve in the past and let me tell you that when it comes to speed , this contest is not even close i am amazed at how unbelievable the internet browsing/email is  .
the pages are very easy to zoom in and out of and as i mentioned , they load in just a second or two then there are the apps i never would have imagined at how much use you can get from the apps  .
everything from a wikipedia app to the news apps to the facebook app to the sports apps    make the experience that much more enjoyable and easier i'm also extremely happy with the ipod player  .
it did not take long to notice that the ipod player in the iphone is better than the actual ipod  .
the menus , displays , and ease of use actually make the iphone preferable i've had everything from motorola phones to blackberry's in the past , and i can tell you this phone absolutely 100% blows everything else out of the water  .
it is baffling as to why some people continue to rip the littlest features about this phone because i'd like to dare them to tell me anything out there that even comes close  .
i'd really like to know what phones out there that some of these people actually think are in the same ballpark as this if you have never owned an iphone before and have been wanting to experience it like i did , then i'm telling you to dive into the 3gs    you will not be disappointed in the least .
i sold my 3g for $250 on craig's list and spent $110 to upgrade to the 32gb 3g    s  .
love it  .
pretty good http  //www  .

no other smartphone comes close to the iphone none .
i enjoy the new iphone 3gs more so because i have experienced the previous iteration  .
the speed increase makes the phone more enjoyable  .
the home button feels different and more comfortable to press and also the oleophobic screen coating is excellent as a single wipe rids the prints  .
the voice control gets a little getting used to but is very well implemented  .
the inclusion of a digital compass is great for anyone that uses the maps app on a regular basis as it rotates to your direction  .
i is jealous when the 2g ipod touch received the nike+ chip and iphone 3g did not so i am very happy to be able to take advantage of that now  .
the camera is definitely a lot more usable now with the added features of video , touch to focus , increased ability in low light situations and other auto functions  .
anyone with a mobile me account will get more use out of the gallery with video included now  .
the smallest new feature but nevertheless important is the battery meter gaining percentage  .
that bit of information gives the user a definite amount of battery as opposed to guessing like in the past  .
the battery seems a bit more accurate now too  .
voice control is definitely a welcome feature as hands free ipod and voice usage is now possible  .
i have used it for ipod control more than voice so far  .
it does take some getting used to but it is not hard to learn the commands since they are passing you by on the screen  .
the earphones control has been changed a bit as it adds a contour in the middle of up and down volume click so the user can click commands and activate voice control by holding down for several seconds  .
i have found the speed increase to be the best feature by far  .
having the ability to speed through opening and closing apps makes the phone a lot easier to take advantage of in moments where you need to get info as quick as possible  .
despite at ts lack of mms support upon launch i feel that new iphone adopters or those eligible for an upgrade will make the easy choice of choosing the 3gs .
worth every penny  .
go get it .
i'd buy another in a heartbeat  .
it is delivered at 10 am on day one and activated by 11 am  .
i've never seen so many whiners about the new 3gs  .
i wonder if they actually own and use one .
i have to say that regardless the lateness from at t to make available picture messaging , the iphone has been by far the best phone and many other things that i've had  .
i'ts been a week since i bought it and i love it  .
everything works smoothly and perfect  .
the best part is that if you need something else , you can get it from an application somewhere  .
this is the best piece of engineering i've had so far  .
great  .
amazing  .
nice toy  .
many years ago , bill gates talked about a wallet pc (http  //www  .
hpcfactor  .
com/reviews/editorial/walletpc/) and today much of his vision has been realized , ironically not by microsoft but by apple this phone does almost everything i need  .
i say almost because it cannot run apps in the background unless the user jailbreaks the phone , which i absolutely will not do  .
(apple needs to let the user decide which apps , if any , they want to allow to run in the background , by simply asking them the same way the android does) it's fast , the call quality is great , the apps are great , the games run much more smoothly on the 3gs than they did on the 3g (for example the sims 3 , hero of sparta and underworlds were almost unplayable on the 3g but run smoothly on the 3gs) , and the load times on everything , across the board are 2    3 times faster the video quality is much better than i expected , with a steady framerate and decent resolution  .
it would be nice if i could tap to focus during video recording instead of just before the recording , but it's amazing that i can tap to focus in the first place so i don't want to complain the bluetooth headphones work much better on the 3gs than they did on my 3g , which introduced too much of a buffer or something because the audio and video would be a little out of sync  .
no problems like that on the 3gs though in all , i'd say apple knocked it out of the park with this device  .
is it phenomenally better than the 3g  .
no , but considering how great the 3g already is i do not think that's a big deal  .
they addressed all the concerns i had with the 3g except the battery life , which is slightly better but not enough (here's hoping for some nanotech breakthrough in battery life in the next 12    24 months  .
the snappiness of this phone is tremendous , and the software enhancements for this phone are fabulous  .
my calls are very clear  .
this is my primary business phone , and every call i've been on in the last week i've asked , can you hear me ok , how do i sound  .
i chuckle and shake my head when i see people give this one or two stars do these people have a sense of their own past  .
like i said above , what would they think if this product is dropped in their lap 10 years ago  .
its simply unfathomably innovative and perfectly executed  .
i also laughed when i read the comment that said apple doesn't listen to their customers  .
i do not even know what that means , but i assure you , i'm glad creative right brained people are driving this boat at apple , and not opinionated lemmings    because customers on their own cannot possibly conceive and execute a product roadmap the way apple is doing    they are executing and making themselves a strong and healthy franchise in the process updated  .

this is the jesus phone suped up on steroids i love this phone so much that i brought it all the way from the states to china cause this phone just makes everything soo much easier all those one stars reviews are just trolls  .
honestly i am a gadget geek and even tho i love apple products i is thinking about getting a pre until i actually borrowed my friends phone for the day and played with the new 3gs and realized the pre is the bastard child of the iphone .
user experience is unparalled  .
love the seamless integration of phone , ipod , handheld game console and the internet cannot wait to see what developers will concoct up with the new apis introduced such as the peer to peer function and the use of the dock connector for external goodies  .
if you don't know your phone the 3gs will be the same as the 3g it is not even close the processor and ram set it far apart  .
enough said pros  .
cut , copy and paste make internet , email and apps count  .
the search function allows me to find what i want without wasting time  .
needless to say that the faster processor and ram make the phone the best phone i have owned  .
speed is the word the compass helps function in the gps  .
finally landscape email and sms  .
voice memos are outstanding to have if you are trying to take notes on the fly the video with editing makes certain task the easiest that i have been able to accomplish and now i don't wish i had my camcorder  .
youtube is has much more to offer on the iphone and i can even sign into my account  .
i can better keep track of stocks and the landscape feature makes it much more tolerable to follow using the app  .
the phone features have changed a little  .
i do like how i can tell if my friends are calling me by mobile or home or where ever i have them listed  .
i also like how states from no caller id is displayed eleven pages to store apps is great and i like how if the eleven do not work you can find the app by going to the search page there is too much to list .
definite buy  .
do not buy the anti    hype  .
this is the hub of my virtual life  .
every major developer has concurred that as far as this platform is concerned , iphone is the start and finish of every conversation .

i play on a 56 inch 3d gaming tv , so i'm only predicting this for the young kids  .
not for 40 year old farts like myself  .
well maybe , new leader boards 2 own  .
this iphone is the best phone i have ever owned  .
the only thing is i feel mms should have been available on the very first phone and at t should have been ready for this powerful device when it first hit the market  .
i am a long time customer of at t and i have no other complaints about them except not being ready for the mms or tethering  .
i have never had any problems with calls droping or making phone calls  .
the only time i experience no coverage or some dead zones is in the country (southern states) and that is some years ago now since more towers have been put in place i have not experienced that problem updated  .
on jul 1 , 2009  .
i cannot believe how this phone could get low reviews  .
they seem unjustifiable and misinformed  .
yes , this phone integrates fine with ms outlook , yes you can easily use this device as a wireless drive with an app called (files or air sharing) the available 3rd party software (apps) and hardware (cases , speakers , headphones) make this device the most supported device by far  .
i've owned the ipod touch for 9 months and have been waiting for apple to release a 32gb iphone since initial launch  .
finally  .
it appears this iphone is considerably faster than before with twice as much ram , faster graphics processor , and a much faster processor the software works seamlessly and typing on the virtual screen is easier than any other device thanks to useful auto correction and feedback the new features work as advertised , this device is much faster than my touch  .
even moving apps around on the device is improved considerably  .
voice quality is great itunes is excellent at integration and the added security of mobile me (ability to find your phone if stolen and wipe your data from a laptop) make this device the only device i do not leave home without .
bottom line is that the new iphone 3g    s is the absolute best device in the mobile industry hands down both in software and in hardware  .
i have no problem with at t service as it is more than acceptable for me i think whoever gets this phone will be absolutely amazed also i opted for the mobileme this way i get instant email just like on my blackberry although the iphone shows html emails muuuuuuuch better than my storm ever could .
i am a verizon customer who jumped ship to at t  .
i had a terrible time with poor call quality and signal strength at home with verizon  .
the difference with the iphone and at t is truly astonishing  .
i cannot agree with the poor call quality assessmsent certainly not true in my case and my signal strength and speed have been consistently excellent  .
i have only had a positve experience with at t so far and would not give my iphone up for anything  .
color me a iphone/at t convert .
i got this phone on its release and is using it to its full potential in less than 3 hours  .
its fast and looks great  .
just sucks when i go thru the battery in one day  .
the best phone ever , and despite seemingly minor updates , the 3gs outperforms the 3g by leaps and bounds  .
everything is in the cnet review  .
watch out for all the apple    bashers putting up low ratings even before this phone came out .
i just love it  .
all these reviews and a lot of them do not even own the phone  .
out of all the phones i've had this has been the best  .
before this i had a blackberry pearl and i hated it , that had a bad interface that using that center scroll ball  .
this iphone just like the original i had is easy to learn and syncs with all my apps , calendar , notes , and mail (at not extra charge unlike my blackberry)  .
my only real complaint is that i've now upgraded from the original iphone plan of 20 per month to 30 per month and mms is not available right now and there is no 3g in this area of michigan (plans have been prepped to upgrade but not till the end of the year from what i have heard)  .
why should i pay extra for a more advanced phone that can only do what my original did  .
we should be compensated until all services are available  .
again bad at t for not being prepared  .
if your looking for a phone with awesome capabilities , tons of free apps , and a carrier with great costumer service this iphone is for you  .
i've had sprint and verizon they still cannot compare in service nor phones like at t .
this is my first iphone , however my friend has the 3g , and i have had both ipod touches  .
starts up way faster than both of them (10 seconds faster) , launches  .
topple 2 10 seconds faster , faster internet (even before at t upgrades their network  .
if you have the 3g and are eligible for the lower price that new at t customers get , go for it  .
if you are not eligible for an upgrade , skip it and wait for the next model , where there will be huge upgrades .
apple continues to be the best phone out there  .
i had the blackberry storm and i hated it with its click screen  .
there is no comparison and with over 30000 applications to download , you cant beat how this item performs  .
simply the best electronic item to come along in 10 years  .
1)flash player support  .
2)quick back option without going to home screen while switching between apps 3)file browsing and storing  .
4)option to attach images , file etc from email app itself 5)multiple signature options  .
6)manual rotate gesture option  .
7)notes app should be more powerful word process (fonts , text size etc)  .
8)all grouping of contacts for test message e  .
friend and family groups 9)app for grouping key social networking sites (for posting universal photos , text to all social networking sites together 10) auto spell check in safari browser (like mozilla) when adding text in twitter , facebook leaving comments at blog etc 11)build in flash in camera for night photo shot  .
12) front facing camera for video chat  .
13) use cover flow for using multitasking third party apps (limit to 5 apps , not to drain the battery life)  .
14)thin quick time player app to run video downloaded from web 15)group notification alert or not attended tasks (missed mms , sms , phone , chat message , meeting , event etc)on single screen roger kent  .
every one like this revolutionary device .
cannot go wrong with this version of the iphone  .
there really is no other phone as good .
let's be frank , iphone 1  .
0 is still the best smartphone (non    business user) on the market  .
3g s propels iphone so far above the competition , there is no good comparison  .
there may be phones that do more , but it's not what you do , but the way you do it .
my iphone is 2 years old , and works great , battery keeps holding plenty of hours of energy , att service so far so good  .
very happy with mine .
it is the best smartphone out there at the moment  .
blows me away  .
could not even imagine a cell phone product so advanced .
up until january of this year , i lived in north carolina and at t is my cell phone service provider  .
i always desired an iphone , but i never got one because the phone i had worked just fine  .
the call quality is decent , but i mostly used it for text messaging anyway  .
now i live in germany , and i have an iphone 3g with t    mobile  .
the customer service is great , along with the network and call quality  .
i recently shattered the top of my iphone screen , but i will definitely be upgrading to a 3g s soon  .
thanks for the in    depth look at another promising product (    .
the iphone 3g s is a great improvement to the iphone line by reducing the price on the 16gb models and introducing the 32gb version  .
apple has done a great job in listening to its customers and adding common smartphone features       regarding mms and internet tethering , do not blame apple or at t  .
the reason that it is not being offered at the moment is because the at t network is being updated to the 7  .
2 mbps speed .
it amazes me that this phone has hundreds of reviews before its actually released  .
do yourself a favor and make sure you listen to people that actually have the phone not iphone fanboys or haters  .
if you've got the money then buy it  .
i like it especially for the squirecon agility and the new broscono unit being built into the speaker  .
from what i under stand the speakers will be able to put out 1000 amps comparatively to a bose speaker system  .
i also like the new add on keyboard that will be shipping with it  .
fromt what i understand there is a slot to slide the iphone in , with the screen still visible  .
absolutely rocks  .
and the integration into windows 7 is far out of this world  .
i can barely wait  .
love the first generation , the one i've had since the beginning and cannot wait to indulge in the new one  .
it's such a great toy .
there may be lot's to write about when the phone is shipped , for now there is nothing to talk about  .

apple is a true patriot  .
it proves that us products are still the best  .
while other companies are lowering american standards  .
with cheap undone stuff updated  .

you cannot review the phone for the lack of improvements first of all no one should be reviewing as no one actually has this phone , and secondly the phone itself is spectacular    better than any other .
none of you own this phone yet  .
stop leaving bad reviews when you have never even laid eyes on the 3g s  .
and the reviews are supposed to be about the product , not the service provider , so please quit with the 1/2 star ratings just because it is an at t phone  .
reviews should be about how functional the product is in a reasonable context .
how are there reviews before the product has been in the hands of the public  .
its kinda dumb that people are rating it based on their positive or negative bias towards the iphone .
the new iphone 3gs has incredible new features and speed , however , many of those new bells and whistles are held back by the poor network .
the bottom line is the iphone 3g s has features and user friendly environment that is un    matched by any other mobile device out there  .
i am a current iphone 3g owner i will defenately be getting the 3g s and selling my 3g mainly because im eligable for the upgrade so it wont brake the bank but even more so with the new features that are coming out which the current 3g is defenately lacking  .
all in all way to go apple on giving us some of what we want but yet leaving more room for growth (by growth i mean more profits for apple by realising yet another model in another year .
cannot wait to upgrade from my original iphone .

Delves into almost every aspect of the new iPhone; very insightful; ----------
Features. Screen. Ease of use. Fast; Battery Life. Plan cost(but really on par with other smart phones
Not enough room. Put Pros in bottom-line summary.; I wish that there was tethering and MMS.
MUCH faster, more features, same great design.; Rogers isn't a great provider, though the only nationwide one in Canada.
Fast response. Exceptional call quality with strong even signal. Long battery life. Amazing variety of applications. Fun product to use.; Can't think of any.
Much faster, new apps and features; Problems dealing with AT &#38; T and Apple as a commercial user
its a great very well rounded product.; nothing i can think of
Great features and functionality. It has great apps and nice screen resolution; uses too much data when I travel overseas
Tons of nice features... Very fast!; None that I can think of at this time.
love the camera; i dont' use the phone much but i suppose it would be reception.
Apple software and speed.. GSM network; At&#38;t house of idiots still think they can make money on long distance calling. ???
None of you own this phone yet! Stop with the bad reviews!; None of you own this phone yet! Stop with the bad reviews!
It is simple to use. Many apps available. It is really a computer, not a phone.; Only AT&#38;T is supported ...
Great apps. Stylish. Fun. Intuitive; Stuck with AT&#38;T for now.. Would like faster web browsing and Video. Flip out keyboard would be nice
1. Lots of useful free applications. 2. Superb Web browsing. 3. Excellent music experience. 4. Ridiculously intuitive and easy to use user-interface; 1. No Flash support. 2. No missed call notification. 3. Iphones are finger prints magnet
Style, function, Superb OS; It's time for Apple to branch outside of AT&#38;T. I would like to have access to VoIP apps.
- Speed. - Voice Dialing. - Video recording. - Improved Google Maps. - Space. - Phone pricing ($200 for 16GB; $300 for 32GB). - All other key aspects of an iPhone (e.g. app store, ipod, itunes, etc); - DATA PLAN!!. The iPhone data plan is grossly expensive.
Mac software. PC like ability. Ipod, remote, interface.; ATT service needs to step it up. Learn from GM and many others. You must compete or you will be gone, iPhone or not.
It's the next-gen iPhone - which will exceed everyone's expectations when it arrives; It's still better than anything else on the market - by a long shot.
the perfect cell phone; lol if I right a con i would feel fooloish for something this amazing
1. Gloriously fast! No signs of twiddling fingers.. 2. Games are almost console-quality.. 3. App Store - 50 000 + (Could only get better with new APIs introduced). 4. Spotlight Search. 5. Exchange integration.; 1. Lack of bluetooth support for sending/receiving files etc.
They fixed all the issues I care about: battery life, video recording, and better camera.; No real negatives. Even copy and paste works good now.
i like it with the Voice Control, i think it is Powerful.; i think the price is expensive.

-Everything about it makes the smartphone experience better than the Blackberry - and it's not close; -No zoom on the camera
speed, design, apps, internet integration, texting, keyboard; gets kinda warm, and battery life, but im constantly on it, so i guess its my fault the battery keeps dying! :)
The phone, the iPod, and all of the apps are amazing.; 3 Letters AT&#38;T
Ease of use, web browsing, e-mail, i-pod, camera, phone navigation, great design, endless apps, having the coolest phone in the universe; UPS charging cord to short
Multi-Touch, Capacitive Display, Design, Ease of Use, Web Browser, App Store, iTunes Store, Battery Life, Music Player, Youtube App, Smooth Scrolling, GPS support, Oleophobic coating, Voice Over, Nike Integration with iPod.; No support for flash, Tied to one carrier, Odd placement of water sensors, No Camera flash, Camera.

Style and design, Speed, Responsive, Voice Control, GPS, App Store, IPOD, Video editing, Blue Tooth. Web Browsing, much improved performance, and battery life. TEXT READER (more about that in the review); No Flash that's it!
Pretty much everything not listed below in the "cons" section; - The apple connector (charging/sync) port.. - Lack of external memory expansion. - Very fragile screen without a case, cracks easily
Fast processor, fast 3g speed, loud speaker, good battery life, and the usual iPhone stuff (awesome OS, great built-in apps, media abilities, games, AppStore, etc.); Voice control doesn't work well for me, only one carrier (AT&#38;T) choice
Lightening quick, new faster tighter gaming rig, sweet mutil-dimensional video with editing. Beyond intuitive. Seamless syncing through itunes for Windows and Mac. Whatever you need to/want to do, there really is an app for that.; Jealousy inducing.
the apps are great. the touch screen. the app store. the camera is good. 32 gb; there is just one thing no flash but it takes good pics
video recording. high quality screen. large storage. upload to youtube. edit video. thousands of applications all very useful!. hours of fun. multi touch is nice; AT&#38;T. some people can't access 3g in some places like any 3g phone
Tons of applications available, many of them free. Very fast. Intuitive and very easy to use. Amazing sound quality!!.; In regards of the equipment itself: NONE!!. Lack of picture messaging from AT&#38;T... yet.
The touch screen is the best I've used. Android and Blackberry don't even come close.; The back is pretty easy to get scratch.
this is the best phone ever!!!!!!. it is like a mini laptop!!!!!!!!!!!; I wish there was flash
I could really understad it event without the phone in my hand.; You sperqated things like it said bad things about the phone then it said more bad things about the phone when i squled down but it was not titled bad things about the phone.
Battery life, ease of use, great look/feel, cut/paste feature a bonus. Excellent warranty customer service through Apple Care, or via the local Genuis Bar.; No multitasking, no pre-installed voice turn-by-turn directions (available with app). Lack of tech support via AT&#38;T Stores.
It is unique, with the app store it rules! You get all features in it. Good touch Keyboard which is important in a touch screen.; Could have had a better camera.
20 seconds from off to the home screen, apps run more smoothly, downloading and sending sms is quicker. Video camera with editing and direct uploading to youtube.; MMS wont be available till late summer 09 (Bad AT&#38;T)
User Interface is tops. And there's an app for everything!; Cons? ....I've thought about it for a few minutes and can think of none.
The best electronics device ever. It is the ultimate example of form and function.; Does not have teleportation....yet.. And too, the speaker phone could be louder.
As the #1 player on XBOXLIVE , i'm here 2 predict once they get a Super Network ( not just AT&#38;T ) ! Say with in 5years , the I~PHONE will be the #1 gaming platform in the World ! Rivaling XBOX , Wii , PS3 combined !!!; Admins at your local Hospital will rise , when people Drive , Walk , and SMASH INTO EACH OTHER !! Look out Gamer coming threw !!!
It is unriveled in it's touch interaction and it's music playing capabilities. The meer feel of the iPhone oozes quality.; Very few characteristics of the iPhone inspire a negative response.
Wi-Fi virtually anywhere allows me to keep connected to email, IM and texts with limited drain on battery life.; Not much but the keyboard can be a pain.
Great screen, versatile, many apps, and good reception for where I live and use my phone. WiFi is great.; does not multitask without having to restart a program, sometimes.
Soooooo simple to use. Apps open &#38; close with no problems, amazing screen clarity, love the virtual keyboard. Web browser is gr8. Apple really hit a home run (as is evident by the sales) with this phone.; Needs better integration with different calendars (Gmail for example)
Fast. Massive Memory. jinternet is great. small tweaks make a user experience even better; only bad thing I can really think of is no flash but most of my shows are also on youtube so its a semi con
ease of use is king. apple has the most responsive screen, best navigation, best apps, best access to your media, give it up haters, only apple is worth your time, period, exclamation point, everyone else is a hater; battery life. so so camera
I like the phone, the apps, and the speed and also the new broscono unit being built into the speaker. Excellent moves; None , this is a great phone
iPhone provides the best interface, coolest design, best features, etc. of any smartphone/PDA. It is unrivaled in all categories, if not by it's featureset alone, then also by it's pleasant ease of use.; AT&#38;T is the worth cell provide in the market. Don't get the iPhone unless you plan on using it unlocked on T-Mobile or elsewhere.
Fast speeds compared to regular 3G, video enhancement is nice and camera is improved. 32GB is nice to have so I can transfer all songs from Ipod touch! Compass and cut and paste features are nice as well!; Voice recognition component needs work. Compass is a waste, not a real necessity.
What's with all the hate? I was looking at the LG EnV Touch, the Palm Pre, HTC Hero, I even looked at the Garmin Nuvi G60. This is the very best cell phone yet. I brought the 32G 3GS. I love everything about it. Great phone!; There is no con other than ATT! But that is not an iPhone problem! I
Everything...what is not to like?; I keep hearing that sound quality is bad, but either i have really good ears or the majority of people out there have really bad hearing.
This is a nice phone, and much better than it's older versions; The price doesn't seem to want to go down any regardless of the age of the phone.
Voice search with google, gps, speed of processor in general, I live near Philadelphia PA and get great reception, and good battery life, I use mine all day long.; Warms up after using it for a long time.
Seamless Microsoft / Mac integration. Super Fast. Unlimited Apps. GPS. Picture and Video Quality. Shake to undo. Voice Command (better than any used previous products); AT&#38;T - Leaving Verizon for AT&#38;T, I have my reserves...and considering their lack of readiness for MMS, it may be a frustrating 2 years
Screen, call quality, applications, very intuitive, fun to use and it just works the way should. Like carrying around a mini computer - even better!; A little pricey but not really for what you are getting.
VERY Fast. Everything about the iPhone and its 3.0 software. Ease of Use; AT&#38;T - other than that the iPhone is superior to other phones in almost every aspect
I've been waiting to upgrade my Treo 650 for an iphone with &gt;16mb of memory space. I mainly use mac native apps, so I appreciate the seamless integration.; Addictive-- to the point that I forget to check my calendar for meetings and appointments.. Battery life--could be better. ATT-- pricing
Much faster than previous models. I don't understand the constant complaining about AT&#38;T. The network is great here in FL beats most of the others in our area. Apple products have been great and service has been great.; The lack of running multiple apps simultaneously is the only con.
Speed. Multi Tasking. Customized MMS and SMS. Tons of amazing apps. Very responsive touch screen and accelerometers. Deactivate-able Rotation. SBprefs is the best thing ever. great GPS,. VNC connection is perfect. Myspace and Facebook integration is great!; Compass is strange and off a bit. Not all apps are free but are hackable
Waaay too many to list. I just love how easy it is to sync with my MacBook. All of my contacts, calendars, notes, email, etc. are always with me. Visual voicemail is the best! FAST and 32 GB of storage.; On AT&#38;T, and not Verizon
I live in Australia and the telstra network is perfect for the iphone with their next g network. Plus the huge range of apps means im not restricted with comparability issues as with other phones; battery life, thats it
Voice commands are excellent- accepts my commands almost flawlessly.. Speed and responsiveness. GPS and compass enhancement simply amazing. Enhanced search in email and left of the home screen. Voice record super clear and fun; I can't think of one single problem or con, except the battery life. I like to put myself back 10 years and imagine what I would think if this phone dropped into my lap... its truly remarkable.
32 Gigs = 2000 songs with 20 Gigs to spare. Fast turn on, Fast email, Fast Internet,. Good Battery - Gets me through the day with constant use. Great video - when your stuck (airports, Dr. Offices, DMV, visiting your inlaws...); The phone is just okay. The keyboard is sometimes difficult but gets better with use - however - the crackberry keyboards are just as bad. I miss graffiti.... Itunes - once in you're in for life (but oh how I love genius!)
Everything, this phone is amazing! It does more than you could ever want it to do...it will never get boring. Sometimes I forget it's even a phone!; Battery life could be a better, I wish the back was a matte finish, a retro Apple logo on the back would be really cool. I really wish google maps included turn by turn voice activated directions.
This is an amazing phone that is light years ahead of my tmobile 8900. Faster, more multimedia, bigger and better screen. It can do everything a blackberry can do but with a lot more STYLE!; No mass media storage. Having to go through iTunes for EVERYTHING. Lack of user interphase customizability. That's it though.
Comparing this against some sci-fi fantasy device, the iPhone 3GS is not perfect. Comparing it against all competition, it is at the very top.; I don't like so many sub menus to get to my email 'dashboard' where I can access my different accounts. It basically takes 4 clicks to get from a message on one email account to a message in another.
Easy to use. 100K+ Apps. Variety of accessories to choose from. Fully integrated with iTune. New futures and updates from Apple every year or so. Very smooth operating software.; I dislike the plastic backing, but I always use a case so it doesn't really matter. Speaker not as loud. I don't like At&#38;t.
it does everything, and if you think is doesnt do everything just check the app store, cause you will find a program that will do it! lolol; have to agree a little bit about the reception on this....and its transition in and out of the 3G and Edge mode
Works the way we think (or at least I think). Call forwarding is very easy, adding incoming new numbers to your directory, etc. Great for watching video podcasts and there's no end to the apps that you can install on this phone.; Only problem: it's a bit addictive.
Its quick, easy, stylish, what more can you ask for? nothing, but it keeps giving with the great applications you can get on it, and have hours of fun on top of everything else!; As far as i can see, the only con is that you cant multitask, but thats going to change with the 4G next month!
The added speed is wonderful. The phone finally functions the way it should be. The bigger camera and video capture is a nice touch.; I would have to say that the 3.0 update has made my wi-fi horrible. Also the phone does get a little warm but nothing to worry about. Battery life could be better and there still isn't multitasking.
Incredible array of features, fast, slick, incredibly easy to use, new features are great. I'll leave the itemized list to the many media reviews.; AT&#38;T, but what can you do - they have a huge job and seem to be working on it. There are features to add, like multi tasking, flash, etc., but my impression is apple doesn't add features unless they work really well and fit the price point.
Everything the iPhone does it does flawlessly...Came from a Blackberry storm on Verizon which was absolutely horrible!!! Now that the iPhone has video recording and a auto focus camera as well as MMS coming soon, i switched and will not look back...; I cannot think of any cons with this phone at all, remember that I came from a blackberry storm which was a complete joke both in software and in hardware...
Great internet browsing, good applications, text messaging built right and a big hard drive for storage what more can you ask for.; I like everything about the Apple iPhone 3Gs, the only thing it doesn't have Java support and MMS but AT&#38;T is working on it.
Ease of use, large screen, syncs with Outlook Contacts and calender; Wish I could change a battery. I do not like the bulky add on battery that plugs in the bottom. The fuel charger is nice but tobig to go in a leather case on your belt.
+ Video camera is better than any phone I've used and 32GB memory is enough to actually hold a lot of video, which my other phones have NOT been able to do.. + Very responsive performance. + Great phone reception (at least in DFW); - Can't run apps in the background. - Battery still not what I'd like. Lasts about a day. - Gets a little hot, not too bad
FAST! No more lag!. Compass, Voice control, Better Graphics, Redesigned earphone controller. Video Camera is very handy and the touch to focus feature makes you wish all cameras had the ability. The oleophobic coating is a very welcome feature.; ATT is still the bane of every US iPhone owner. They want to do the provisioning in one single update in order to not create a customer service nightmare for them since the older phones are not pre provisioned for MMS. Thats what they told me anyway.
I really like the upgrades in speeds in pretty much every category. All process are faster plus they have a lot of helpful new features like the compass. As a hiker, I really loved the compass and the new camera (w/ the pre-existing geo-tag feature).; AT&#38;T. I think AT&#38;T is overpriced and crappy. I like the roll over minutes, but their 3G network is pathetic and the fact that they don't support MMS messages is sad. My middle school students wonder why I stick with them.
Speed, Fast 3g, great call quality and great 3g reception, dont know where you get that it does not have great call quality and reception.; The only thing I can think of is ATT is not supporting MMS and Tethering yet but other than that the phone is awesome and my ATT service is the best, it was worse when I was with Sprint and Verizon.
Speed! I have the 16GB 3GS in white and I love how fast the phone can access the iPhone apps as well as the internet. I love how it feels in my hands (you can feel the quality of the phone). Great phone!; Battery power runs out fairly quickly if you are using the apps a lot (and you will!). However, listening to music on a 2 1/2 hour train ride from San Diego to Los Angeles only consumed approx 5% of the power. No Adobe Flash player capability.
I can take it out and capture my daughter as she grows into a toddler on video w/o worrying about having my video camera. Can take pictures when I need w/ Great Quality.All the apps I want are free.; Needs bluetooth file transfer to any device. I don't want to and haven't jailbroken my phone, but know the phone is capable. Would like way to see windows media files that I get as attachments.
Everything is a pro on this phone. I know people like the idea of multi tasking but that only wears the battry down and speed of the phone is fast enough to close one app and open another. Call quality great and download speeds are thru the roof.; ATT network is not big enough to keep up with the demand. ATT needs to step up the towers. Still no major complants from me.
Really good features coming in. Compass, voice dialing, better cam plus video, MMS, Faster response from aps, and better graphics for gaming. Defenately will out due to my Iphone 3g. So i def will upgrade i wouldnt pay full price but i am elligible.; No cons. Apple is here to make money and i see now that the iphone will be just the like the ipods. there going to give us great features just not all at once. Why would they when they can make so much more money doing it the way they are
I am not an Apple devote' but I really admire this product. Bottom like the breadth and power of the OS is unmatched on any other phone product. This is an incremental upgrade - it just makes the IP run so much smoother! It all went perfect for me.; None except too many dead areas on ATT network I am sure ATT is under a lot of stress from this product but it has brought them a lot!
- Its touch screen is the best you will ever find.. - The built in iPod is better than any other music player out there.. - The App Store (which has tons free items) is revolutionary.. - The customization makes every iPhone unique in its own way.; - It's very limited when used on AT&#38;T. Just because AT&#38;T are idiots. AT&#38;T are going to charge extra for tethering, and are taking their sweet time giving MMS. I would recommend using this phone with T-Mobile. Google how to do that.
