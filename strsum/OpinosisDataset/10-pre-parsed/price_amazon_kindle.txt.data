books are retardedly pricey .

lower overall price, with nice leather cover .

should have been priced at $250  .

4 delivery and prices for austrian user

non, best seller book prices should be lower, just like some magazine subscriptions are .

of course they won't be priced at $9 .

disappointing given the prices .

books are priced in us$ for oversea consumers .

savings trump purchase price with kindle's low book price advantages .

one, for what you get it is over priced .
