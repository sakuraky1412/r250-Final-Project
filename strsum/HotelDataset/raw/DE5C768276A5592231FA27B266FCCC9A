we traveled around south africa on a motorbike .
on the day we arrived prince albert we were exhausted as we drove more than 300km that day alone and we got 40oc on the road .
we were not looking for any special place and were not expecting much .
but as soon as we stopped the motorbike at the entrance we were greeted by a very friendly manager who helped us to unload our luggage from the cases with a very warm and friendly welcome smile .
the hotel is built in a century renovated house , the rooms are spacious and with a lot of light and well decorated and the toilet is quite big .
wi-fi works wonderfully !
we showered and went down to the hotel restaurant for dinner and it was another surprise , it was one of the best meals we got in south africa , and served by the kindest of staff !
we ended the night chatting with the manager in the esplanade and we made a good friend , as he also loves and travels on motorbikes and gave us a lot of tips for trips in south africa and other african countries .
they also have a shop with handcrafted goods and gourmet foods , i wanted to buy some but unfortunately had no space to take them on the motorbike , which was a pity .
if you are travelling around the area , stay at this hotel or eat at their restaurant , i am . . .
