Pros:. It was so easy to take this camera out of the box and start using it. I've never had a camera this nice, just used disposables and cheap digitals before, but I had no problems figuring out the basics of it in no time.. 
Cons:. Haven't come across any, and hope I do not.. 
Summary:. If you are looking into getting into serious picture taking, but don't want to spend a fortune, this is what you need. It takes fantastic pictures and is so easy to use. I love everything about it!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Photo quality, battery life, quick autofocus, light body, versatiile, self'cleaning sensor.. 
Cons:. Shoulder strap can come undone easily on its own.. 
Summary:. This is my first dSLR so I�m by no means an expert on the subject. I purchased this camera as a transition to taking better photos and learning more about photography. I�ve really been enjoying using it and would recommend it to anyone considering taking a step up in digital photography. Do a feature comparison between other similar products and you�ll see why the Xsi comes out on top for an entry level dSLR. Photo quality is excellent with the new image processing chip in this camera, however it also depends on the lens that you�re using. The packaged 18-55mm lens is a great start, but I would recommend adding a telephoto lens as well. The only issue I�ve had with the camera is the shoulder strap, which came undone on its own while I was carrying the camera, I caught it before it hit the ground, but I�ve since put some stiches though the two ends of the straps to ensure that it doesn�t happen again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use for first time DSLR user.. Great pictures at all ISO ranges.. Price (11/09) is excellent compared to competition.. 
Cons:. Haven't found any yet.. 
Summary:. I highly recommend it over Nikon. Canon is much more user friendly and at a more affordable price.. I opted for the kiss x2/ xsi/ 450D because I did not need video and 15MP of 500D. The 500D costs almost $100 USD more, and I thought it unnecessary.. The camera is alot of fun. And I am 100% satisfied with my decision. I had weighed buying a G11 before, but realized SLR quality will always be above that.. If you want to step up your photos, on a budget, its the perfect buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Starts up fast. Fast reaction time. No delay. Crisp focus. Easy controls. Intuitive settings. Nice color in all lighting situations. Very low noise. Best camera I've ever owned whether film or digital.. 
Cons:. I wish there was a way to turn off the shutter sound.. 
Summary:. Best digital SLR for the money. If there is something better, I can't imagine what it is.. 

$$;
Pros:. fantastic photo quality. good platform to learn on. offers flexibility for those not limited to auto modes. price. 
Cons:. slighly small. not as nice on the hands as nikon. 

$$;
Pros:. Small Size, good ergonomics, simple interface, ability to grow with the camera, great kit lens, clear and large LCD, lightweight. 
Cons:. Small viewfinder. lacks 2 dedicated wheels/buttons for aperture/shutterspeed. plastic body. 
Summary:. I am very satisfied with my purchase of the XSi. First off, if you are looking for a dSLR, you can read all all the reviews in the world, but what you should focus on first and foremost is how the camera feels in your hand. So, set your budget first, get to a camera store and pick up all of the cameras in your price range and play with them for a while. Once you pick a few that you like, then read the reviews on cnet, etc.. This camera is great for my small hands, and my husband (who had larger hands) states he likes the feel of it. I love the small size and weight. I can carry it around all day without a problem. The kit lens is actually a great lens optically (especially based on the price). The menus are simple the buttons easy to press and change function settings.. HOWEVER*** if you are buying a dSLR (ANY dSLR) solely because you think it will make you take pictures better than your point and shoot camera, you might be disappointed with this or any dSLR. You really do have to be willing to learn how to shoot in manual mode, adjust shutter speed, aperture, ISO, etc. You can likely take pictures that are on par with cameras costing several thousands of dollars with this camera, but you have to put in the time to learn photography. A lot of my friends are disappointed with all of their fancy new expensive dSLRs because they only use "program" or "auto" mode. Just some food for thought.. But back to the XSi. I love the camera. Not too much noise at high ISOs, a great dSLR without breaking the bank.. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb image quality. Easy to use. Lightweight. Kit lenses are great for the beginner to novice photographer.. 
Cons:. Button placement.. 
Summary:. Excellent camera. What other camera with this grade of quality can you pick up with a 18-55mm IS AF and 55-250mm IS AF lens kit for under $750! I could go on forever but I will say buy one now. You will not regret it!. 

$$;
Pros:. 3 inch LCD, Low noise at 1600 ISO, fast start up, software for RAW conversion, easy to learn menu, and fantastic images...it's a Canon. 
Cons:. The kit lens isn't exactly fast but acceptable. 
Summary:. For the money hard pressed to find better performance. 

$$;
Pros:. Out of the box easy to use but gives the manual control we want. So far we love the camera.. 
Cons:. Nothing yet. 

$$;
Pros:. Live View 3 inch screen, image stabilizer lens, automatic and scene modes as well as full manual controls, fast performance, excellent photo quality, good exposure controls and manual exposure BULB setting, easy to use for an SLR, 12MP, good battery.. 
Cons:. There are no real cons or complaints other than I wish I was able to save my own multiple personalized settings profiles (eg. specific favorite settings for night photography that I can save and come back to later) but that's not a big deal.. 
Summary:. The Rebel XSi (EOS 450D) is a great DSLR camera, perfect for beginners and pros. The image quality is excellent and boasts great performance. I love the large 3 inch screen and it is great that it has Live View, although I don't use that feature much. I like that the camera is easy to get into as a beginner and you can gradually get deeper into the settings and manual adjustments. There are the auto and scene mode options, as well as the full manual controls. The My Menu feature is also handy. The camera is comfortable to hold and overall a nice purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy operation, but still excellent picture quality. 
Cons:. Flash light shoul be physically adjustable.. 
Summary:. My preferred camera. I could say: exactly as my Nikon AF used to be 20 years ago.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love this DSLR Camera which I bought from BuyDig, it has absolutely stunning color, the IS lens overcomes the problems that the XTi experienced and this is an easy camera to use through a well thought out menu system.. 
Cons:. I wish the rebates would be available directly from Canon, none of the stores want to deal with the instant rebate unless they can pop up the price of the lens needed to get it.. 
Summary:. Trust me, you won't regret your choice, just go out and run it through its stuff.. 

$$;
Pros:. great features + perfect for begginer SLR users &#38; proffessionals + affordable. 
Cons:. waaay underrated. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick focus, great color, Love the IS. 
Cons:. Cheap plastic body. Hope I never drop it... 
Summary:. After I purchased this camera, I sold my Sony A350, DSC-F717, and my Rebel XTI .. It's a great camera Buy one... You will love it... 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, awesome image quality, light, and more!. 
Cons:. I am now $900 poorer. 
Summary:. This is my first dSLR, but I have used P&#38;S cameras before. I really like it, just take a bit of learning about proper exposure, and most of my pictures come out really good!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture Quality. 
Cons:. None that I found. 
Summary:. Compared to the Rebel XT and XTi, this new XSi with the new 18-55 IS kit lens is superior in every way. The focusing is faster and more accurate. The exposure is right on. I found the spot metering to work well too. Wish the spot area was smaller to be more accurate, but for this price range it is acceptable. The camera has many customizable features that can make your pictures sharper. I am having fun experimenting its many advanced features, and my pictures are superior to the previous models. The new 55-18 IS lens is a fantastic bargain as a kit lens. Grab it, it takes unbelievable sharp pictures. I took a hand-held picture of my dog at 1/8 of a second, and I couldn't believe how sharp it came out. The len's IS feature works great, give you about 3 F stops cushion. I am very impressed with this new camera kit. I highly recommend it for both advanced shutter bugs as well as beginners.. 

$$;
Pros:. -auto-set features are great for each setting. -live view feature has help on more than one occasion for long exposure shots. -menus are easy to navigate and very usable even when changing settings on-the-fly. 
Cons:. -ISO is not up to par on this camera. It is almost a shortfall for the camera itself, though there are ways to make up for that by using other manual set features.. 
Summary:. The bottom line.... this is a great camera for beginning and intermediate photographers. The slew of setting options for the camera make it great for someone who is afraid to use anything other than the auto settings, all the way to someone using all manual settings and about to move to a more professional camera. The ISO options do lack on this camera, and can fall short in some cases. But through the use of other setting this shortfall can be made up for if you know how to use the manual settings properly. All in all, this is a well rounded camera and can be a great camera when in the hands of a good photographer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image quality, Image stabilization, easy to navigate menu and functions.. 
Cons:. Can't think of anything.. 
Summary:. Easy to use with great photo results.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use. While there are cameras that will do more, the XSi has enough features for me. Unlike some photographers, I find this camera a joy to use and hold as I have relatively small hands.. 
Cons:. Nothing at this time. I did my homework before I invested in this camera. It would be nice to have a two year warranty like Nikon, but Canon builds quality products and it should last me for years.. 
Summary:. After a year of trying out DSLR's and reading countless reviews, I purchased the XSi. I really enjoy using it and am looking forward to acquiring a couple of nice lenses (a wide angle or primary and a zoom are high on my wish list) and being more "photographically active".. It fits nicely in my hands and is easier for me to use than the larger Canons and some of the better Nikons.. I considered the T1i but for the price difference, which is mainly to add HD movie capability, the XSi was an choice. I can put the $300 I save into a quality lens.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast startup, great picture quality, Auto mode helps the beginner take great shots. 
Cons:. A lot of features causes a larger learning curve.. 
Summary:. My wife and I love this camera! We bought it about a month and a half ago and bring it where ever we go. The quality of the images is great. There is a lot of advanced features however I enjoy being able to turn it on auto and not have to worry about my settings. I have not learned how to disable the flash other then pressing the button half way down and when the flash pops up I press it back down and then take my picture. The live view is nice for finding focus with astrophotography but in a real shooting environment the 1/2 sec delay between pressing the button and shooting makes it less then a point and shoot. The advanced features of the camera allow you to grow and advance your skills at your own pace. We were going to purchase another point and click but with my son growing up we wanted something that we could use for years to come and this was a great choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large LCD; Live View; sensor cleaner; easy to use; lightweight; good battery life. 
Cons:. Camera ergonomics problematic. 
Summary:. As my first DSLR, I couldn't ask for a better camera. Light and easy to use, the pictures it produces are nothing short of astounding, even using the toy-like 18-55mm kit lens that came with the camera. Only issue I have is that the right hand grip seems a bit small, but then I've got large hands... Great starter camera for those wishing to upgrade from a point-and-shoot!. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality, high ISO quality, improved viewfinder, 3" LCD screen, size, weight, accepts the RC-1 remote price, kit lens improved menus, My Menu, faster motor,. 
Cons:. SD cards, small buffer, another new battery size and charger, no single button mirror lock up. 
Summary:. The XSi is a break through camera in many respects. It's image quality of it's sensor is remarkable for any 12 MP camera, regardless of price. The IS kit 18-55mm lens is the best ever offered by Canon and is highly useable by photographers of virtually any level. Canon has never offered a camera with as good image quality at ISO's 400, 800 and 1600. The XSi makes a great first camera, but also a potentially valuable second or third body for the more experienced photographer. The camera body weighs very little and fits into the space occupied by a single lens in a camera pack. The XTi is an excellent camera in almost all respects, but the XSi moves the 'entry level' Canon camera ahead in almost every area. The only negatives I can think of are the switch SD cards, the need for 'another' new battery and charger and while you can pre-set settings in 'My Menu', it would excellent if there were 'one button' access to mirror lock up on ALL Canon camers.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple menu, large screen, true-view, long lasting battery. 
Cons:. A bit expensive. True view focusing is on the slow side. 
Summary:. I got the kit lens with this camera. I had a Canon XT and though it was still a great camera I wanted to update it. I looked at the XTi and loved the larger screen but good thing I waited a bit more for the XSi. The larger screen is a god send. No more small screens to read the menu. The focusing is faster and the IS lens is an improvement from previous models. I was debating to get this or the 40D since the 40D was supposed to be a step-up from a basic model. Glad I chose the XSi.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture, Large Screen. 
Cons:. Haven't Found one yet. 
Summary:. You'll be missing out if you pass on this product. A lot of helpful gadgets. Putting on different lenses is very simple.. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb image quality at ISO 1600. Long battery life. LCD size.. 
Cons:. Plastic body. Slightly uncomfortable grip.. 
Summary:. My XSi is only a few days old, so I haven't had a chance to put it through it's paces. I have the original Digital Rebel and the Sony F717 for 5 years, but I have been using my friend's XTi for the pass year. With the few shots I have taken with the XSi I am already impressed with the image quality at all settings. I had no problem navigating my way around the buttons and menu right out of the box and the IS feature on the lens is a plus. I am dying to try it with the 55-250mm EFS IS lens.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, solid body. 
Cons:. only goes up to iso1600. 
Summary:. this was my first digital slr. came down to either the canon 450d xsi and the nikon d80... it seems there are nikon people and there are canon people, i was always a minolta guy, so when it came time to buying my first dslr, i did a lot of research. there are pros and cons to both the canon and the nikon. my brother is a canon guy and my sister is a nikon girl, they both presented their case and in the end i agreed with my brother. a few of his arguements stuck with me, one was that the canon is able to use nikon lenses while the nikon cant use canon lenses. second the canon is 2 mega pixels more. third, while you're able to take amazing pictures with both cameras, both are entry level dslr, neither one is going to make you a professional photographer. that being said, the first picture i took with my new canon 450d xsi is probably the most beautiful picture i've ever taken. the colors and shadows are so vibrant and the detail is sooo incredibly sharp. i cant say enough good things about it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very light and compact for an SLR. 
Cons:. Focusing with Live View can be a pain in the neck. 
Summary:. This is my 3rd.DSLR, first one being Nikon D200, then Canon 350D and now 450D (Xsi in USA). Vast improvement over the previous 350D model. Kit lens doesn't look cheapy anymore, decent engineering and good looks with a bonus of Image Stablizing system. I use kit lens along with EF 28 -135 IS USM lens. Excellent resolution and sharpness. No wonder it's selling like hot cakes here in Thailand!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Pictures, Great features, and I love the Live View. 
Cons:. The kit lens is just OK. Get the body only, and then buy the 17-85m IS lens.. 
Summary:. This is my third SLR (xi, Nikon d60 and this xsi) and this is by far the best camera I have ever purchased. The kit lens is ok, but you're going to want one with a little more zoom and clarity almost immediately. That said, you're only paying an extra 100 for it, so I guess it's kinda worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Images. 
Cons:. None for a beginner like me. 
Summary:. I would highly reccomend this camera mostly because of the great pictures it takes. CNET has rated this as a 7.8 on a 1-10 scale, but they gave the XTI a 7.8 rating also while the XSI's video review seemed to say that it was better than the XTI. So it appears to me that they should have rated it higher than a 7.8. Anyway, I believe I have a great camera, and I don't think you can go wrong with Canon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good image quality up to iso 400.. Detailed and sharp in RAW mode.. Fast, intuitive, sharp screen.. Takes 3 images per second.. You can creat your own color mode using the software, so it is used on every picture you take using that mode.. 
Cons:. soft images in JPEG (though better than on most cameras). noise performance at iso 800 isn't that great.. The screen won't display some of the colors accuratly (oranges, pink and purple). The default colors are desaturated (easily fixed). 
Summary:. I have enjoyed a lot using the camera, it never disappoints, I love it even with it's little flaws, because my main concern is image quality, wich is very good using RAW mode. The camera is very easy to use, lightweight and battery life is enough for even two long photography sessions. I love it since my last camera was a sony H1. I know the XSI is out of date, but i just joined CNET so I wanted to leave my comments.. Greetings from Guatemala, by the way !. 

$$;
Pros:. Only had it for a month but I like it so far the picture. I've taken of my long haired cat showed every little hair on her head in every shade of color.. 
Cons:. No LCD screen in auto mode !!!. 
Summary:. I got it on sale here in L.A. for $500. which means there is a replacement coming soon. I've only seen better pictures on cameras that cost much more. Great entry level SRL for the $$$. 

$$;
Pros:. Realibility! Technology! Simplicity! New Battery! SD storage! EOS family!. 
Cons:. looks complicated to new users.. 
Summary:. I love this camera! Highly recommended to new users!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast shutter speed, bright vivid color, easy to handle. 
Cons:. The grip is not that comfortable but it is light weight which I love. 
Summary:. am so happy with my new Canon XSI camera! I was torn between it and a Nikon D90 and I'm not disappointed. With the extra money I bought another lens and assesories. This camera is light weight (just had hand surgery and have no streghth in my hand) and it has everything I want in a camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. the light wieght and speed shuttering is fantastic and for a small flash it is great. 
Cons:. the handling less hands space got to keep it to your neck. 
Summary:. i like this eos because of the qualites of the image and for a small fast it does great inside pictures even in more dark place when program right. this camera is worth the buy. 

$$;
Pros:. better ergonomy than 350D and 450D,- good image quality,- possibility to change ISO settings in viewfinder,- 3-inches LCD,- good autofocus. 
Cons:. ISO 3200 absence,- Menu key in uncomfortable place.. 
Summary:. I've used Canon EOS Xt (350D) earlier. 450D is better younger brother of this camera. I'm contented of my XSi beacause I have good quality of photos for a quite good money. Photography is my biggest passion and in future I want to buy more advanced Canon camera, for example EOS 50D. Effects of my work with Canon (and Panasonic earlier) at: www.rafalgdak.pl. 

$$;
Pros:. Long exposure noise reduction (great for night photography), beautiful RAW, 14-bit A/D processing, very portable, SDHC is cheap, built-in USB 2.0 is actually pretty fast.. 
Cons:. hand grip isn't quite bit enough, hunts for focus in low light, 6 continuous bursts in RAW doesn't seem like a lot. 
Summary:. I spent a TON of time evaluating all the SLRs in my budget. I just took a film photography class and discovered I loved photography, but I couldn't decide which camera I wanted. I have a lot of friends who went with the Nikon D80, and when I picked up both of them at the store, my hand liked the D80 more than the XSi. However, when I got to the operation of the camera, the XSi made a lot more sense. The operations on the D80 seemed overly-complicated and besides that, it just felt old, considering the XSi was just released. I have to say, I'm loving the XSi, but it wasn't long before I got bored of the kit lens (18-55 EF-S IS). Now, I'm shooting with a Canon 50mm f/1.8 MkI, from the 80s (I think), very nice piece of glass, similar to what I was using for my film camera. I encourage everybody who buys an XSi to buy a 50mm. They're relatively cheap and the optical quality is WAY better than the kit lens.. If you're not going to use the creative modes, you might as well buy another camera. I find that if I put it in Auto mode, it actually feels like a different camera. In the creative modes, it feels nearly identical to shooting on film without all the developing time and chemicals. Almost feels too easy. After doing some night shots with film, I wanted to do some night shooting. Initially, I was disgusted at the noise with long exposures, but turning on the "Long Exposure Noise Reduction" function yields incredible results. A 5-second exposure at ISO 100 looks quite controlled, even for the pixel-picky. I didn't know about that function when I bought it, but I'm so glad it's there.. Shooting in RAW, Adobe RGB, 50mm f/1.8, and processing with Aperture on my Mac (running Leopard) is almost heavenly. Using a new iMac, MacBook Pro, or Mac Pro is the ideal system for the photographer. I thought I would be bummed that there are no FireWire SDHC card readers currently available, but the camera's built-in USB 2.0 is actually not as bad as I feared it would be. It feels really fast.. Here's how I made my decision: The D80: too old and big. The D60: doesn't have a mechanical focus coupling or something like that. If I recall, all the current NIKKOR prime lenses (the ones I would want the most) require focus couplings, if you don't have one, those lenses won't auto-focus (that's a deal-breaker for me).. The XSi is a terrific camera for me. It leaves me lots of room to grow as a photographer without overwhelming me with features and operations I don't need.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality. 
Cons:. too light. does. Handle bothers hand in long shooting. 
Summary:. Great camera! Fantastic Pics. Slighly slower than 40D.. The Handle does not ergonomically feel right. I almost need a third joint in my fingers to be able to grab the camera comfortablly. as a result after a while my hand gets really sore. i do not have this problem with 40D which is bulkier just enough to fit righ in my hand. And i do have pretty average size hands.. also it autofocus sometimes has problem finding the right focus in low light photography.. 

$$;
Pros:. Self cleaning sensor. 3 in display. Good menu layout.. 
Cons:. Not as comfortable as my old nikon. Live view is weak.. 
Summary:. The xsi, being my 3rd dSLR, is a nice camera with many features. I find that the color reproduction in my pictures are more to my liking than with my old D70(personal preference). I love the larger 3 inch LCD display. 12MP is probably over kill unless you do a lot of cropping or extremely large prints. If you have big hands the camera will probably be a bit uncomfortable to hold, as I have smaller hands and I find it could use a tad bit more on the height. The menu layout is good and easy to navigate. Pictures are written to memory quickly(using Extreme III). The live view is about worthless, to me anyways. Its slow and the auto focus doesn't responded well. The kit lens will be fine if you are a novice or just like to point and shoot. Although this does have improvements over the xti, you'll have to decide if it's worth the extra $$ for the few extra features. The xti can be had for much less and you can get a nice lens with the $$ you save. If you are an hobbiest or experienced photographer I would definitely consider the 40D for not much more.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image Quality. 
Cons:. Grip, Price, Poor spot metering. 
Summary:. Good camera but I prefer the A200.. "The reviewer said Though it'll run you a few bucks more than competitors such as the Sony Alpha DSLR-A200 or the Nikon D60, the Canon EOS Rebel XSi will deliver slightly better performance and noticeably better photo quality in return, making it a worthwhile trade-off.". I don't know what to say about that. I did some extensive comparisons on line at various web sites that had photographic samples and for the life of me I can't see a significant difference in IQ between this camera and the A200 (or the D60 for that matter) even at 100%. For that reason I like the Sony for the built in image stabilization and better overall handling (and lower price). Looking for insignificant differences in IQ at the pixel level has no practical value.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Good quality outdoor photos (landscapes, portraits, etc). 2. Vivid colours. 
Cons:. 1. Auto focus fails for brown and blue colour variations.. 2. Portrait mode only allows continuous shooting mode (does not allow select single shooting mode). 3. Poor performance under low light. 4. Produces large number of out of focus photos.. 
Summary:. The performance is not enough for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. higher pixels?. 
Cons:. plastic lens mount?. 
Summary:. would the xsi be better choice or the 40d. 

$$;
Pros:. Sits in hand and handles nicely. Supplied lens not wonderful, but good value for the price. Alleged image quality - BUT NOT IN MY EXPERIENCE. 
Cons:. I was told that this is a fine camera. How nice, for those who bought a decent specimen! Mine's image quality has never been fit for purpose: and it is effortlessly outperformed by Panasonic Lumix compacts and even by an Olympus X-925.. 
Summary:. My 450D's images are not only overexposed but bloated, soft, undersaturated and soggy.. 20 December 1009. Mr Andy Vickers. The Managing Director. Canon UK Limited. Dear Mr Vickers. I am assured that any attempt to communicate with you is a waste of time, since you or your Secretary will simply pass my letter back to your Second Line Customer Support team. These appear to be judge and jury not merely as regards the quality of your rather-expensive products, but of Canon's accountability as an entity within the public and corporate domains. Nonetheless, persisting in my hope that Canon's Managing Director might not be a deity entirely removed from the domain of mortal communication, I thought I'd give you a shot.. First, something that amused me a little. Having tested your digital camera's performance quantitatively using Adobe Photoshop CS3, I am advised by Mr Lalit Dhiri of your Second Line Technical Team that Canon "does not recognise" Adobe Systems, believing them to lack credibility and to represent merely "third party software.". Forgive me if I attach little credence to Mr Dhiri at the best of times, since his team's third attempt to repair my camera has left it in a worse state than when I bought it. I'm left with less faith in your technical team than I would place in a 1950's Weston Bakelite selenium light meter - something of which Mr Dhiri has doubtless never heard. Perhaps this is the answer: to write off the electronic systems in your camera and to use instead my old Dad's collection of photographic antiques?. A recent exchange of emails with Mr Aaron Edgeworth (of your Second Line Support Team) serves to sum up this case:. RE: Canon - this isn't good enough. To: aaron_edgeworth@cuk.canon.co.uk. Dear Mr Edgeworth. Have you not seen any of my foregoing correspondence with your Canon UK Repair Centre? Since it would seem that you have not: I have supplied your colleagues with image after image showing in quantifiable and scientifically valid terms, how badly this camera differs from what would be acceptable in a camera costing a quarter the price. The data I supplied have nothing to do with "matters of opinion" or "taste". They detail the numerous and hopeless failings of this camera with measured precision. Please would you familiarise yourself with these repeated submissions before we take our correspondence further.. I have in my hand a Panasonic Lumix which cost a third of what your SLR cost. Its impeccable images beat the stuffing out of yours. I was going to say that your camera is the worst I have had since I was seventeen years old, since for my eighteen birthday my father bought me the Pentax KM SLR upon which I learnt my technique and my trade. This was 34 years ago. But come to think: the images I gained as a child from a Kodak Instamatic were more reliably exposed than the Canon's. So I think we have to count this Canon 450D camera my worst ever. Correcting its grotesque failings has wasted hours if not days of my creative life. I am sorry that I ever bought it; for it has proved my biggest waste of money in fifty-two years.. I no longer have faith in your Repairs team. Yes: I could provide more raw and also corrected images, showing that since its last repair the 450D is worse than when I first bought it. But since you have no familiarity with what I have already shown to your organisation: why should I waste more time and effort to duplicate what should already be staring you in the face?. You have supplied a product which is not worthy of your reputation and which is, to quote your more helpful colleague on the Canon telephone helpline, "Unfit for purpose". Now is high time to do something about it. If I were in Canon's shoes I should feel so deeply ashamed that I should take matters into my hands for the sake of professional repute and honest, decent practice.. Stephen Jackson. [...Returning to my letter to Mr Vickers:]. The reason that I did not return the EOS 450D to the vendor (Ebuyer) within its one-year guarantee is because of my misplaced faith in your Repairs Team and in Canon's corporate standards, its repute. Now it is Canon's glib effort to pass the buck, to dump the buck on anybody but yourselves, that has left me sick to the teeth. It is this that leaves me indignant to a degree that I have not felt in many years. All you can do is to repeat with your fingers in your ears that I must pass your problem onto another company in the hope that they might show the sense of decency and fair play that Canon so manifestly lacks: that they, unlike you, will be prepared to go the extra mile.. If only I had known at the outset that your Customer Support has even less interest in resolving legitimate grievances than it has in making good Canon's mistakes, that contacting you was a waste of time and that I should return a faulty product to the vendor forthwith: how different my last fourteen months would have been..

Pros:. Speedy picture taking (once it figures out what you want). 
Cons:. See opinion. There were a lot.. 
Summary:. Most people seem to love this camera, so I can only assume I have a bad one, or the lens that came with it was so bad as to ruin the camera's functionality.. I purchased this as Costco, with an EF-S 18-55 mm lens included.. I started out with the "Point and click" mode, not expecting much, but expecting better than my standard "Point and click" camera. Imagine my surprise when the indoor picture taken was not even remotely as focused as my 6mp Kodak Z612 (which has a killer zoom for a point and click, and great outside pics, but is not very good inside). So I moved on to the "Creative" modes. No matter what I did, or how I adjusted, the Kodak outperformed the Canon in sharpness, color, color contrast and image stabilization. You can't even adjust the ISO on the Kodak, and I still got sharper indoor pictures.. I did not like that I was unable to turn off the flash in "auto" mode, only in creative mode.. I also found that when I adjusted the settings, the first picture taken took longer to snap than subsequent pictures, like the camera was trying to figure out what was different. All subsequent pictures snapped quickly, until I changed settings again.. The Canon was great for speed, and long about the third picture in a burst, the focus usually came through, but I'm usually a single shot person. I've tried two, maybe Costco got a bad batch, but the camera is unusable unless you want fuzzy pictures..
