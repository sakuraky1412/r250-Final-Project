we stayed for one night in february .
when we arrived to book in we were upgraded to an executive room with a terrace overlooking the park .
it had a huge super king bed , fantastic bathroom with walk in shower and deep free standing victorian style bath .
the room has all the usual , coffee machine ( i could n't work out how to use it but i am sure had i bothered to ask one of the lovely staff members would have told me ) , a kettle , biscuits , milk , a safe , everything you need for a comfortable stay .
there is not only free wi fi but every room is equipped with a mac computer .
the breakfast was waitress served and cooked to order and the menu varied from full english to smoked salmon and scrambled eggs , kippers , eggs benedict , and much more .
there was also a buffet with real juices ( large glasses which is unusual , you normally get wine size glasses for juice ) , fresh fruit , meats , cereals , yoghourt , etc .
, the coffee was fine too .
i am a coffee drinker and can rarely drink the hotel breakfast offering , so this was a pleasant surprise too .
when we asked for late check out they said yes with a smile .
this was a business trip and we paid a little more for this hotel than we usually do however it was well worth the extra and we shall definitely stay here again next time we are in . . .
