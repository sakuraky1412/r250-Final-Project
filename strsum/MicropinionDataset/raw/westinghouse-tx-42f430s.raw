Pros:. 1080p resloution, excellent price, great features. 
Cons:. none, just a great tv.. 
Summary:. I am guru when it comes to electronics. I had been researching and looking at TV's for more than a year when I saw this TV on sale at best buy. I was a little nervous about purchasing a Westinghouse because we only own a space heater made by them. This TV is good as any other Samsung tv but for a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend this TV because of its very high picture quality, low price, and great features. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, 4 HDMI inputs, menu control. 
Cons:. redish hue, reliability. 
Summary:. PC World rated this #2 in July08 at a price of $949. I had a good experience with the Westinghouse 37", so I went for an update. It's a nice step up, I would not want to go any larger with current 480p video feeds. HD looks great. Better menu &#38; more HDMI ports than my 37", but I lose my DVI port(no big deal).. Run to Best Buy, this went on sale 8/1/08 for $799 as a discontinued item. See online bestbuy for a store that still has one. Mine had 3, but the store still had it listed at 949, they honored the online price.. Other reviews state they had product failures after a few months, so I went with Best Buy's extended 4yr warrenty for $144. Anything goes wrong, they come to my house...don't have to worry about shipping.. There is a slight redish hue, so I lower the setting...seems to help.. Regards,. X. 

$$;
Pros:. Low price, 1080P, Great visual quality. 
Cons:. 1000:1 Contrast Ratio. 
Summary:. Overall it's realy a great TV at a great buy. I picked it up for $1089. I'd say it's probably the cheapest 1080P LCD out there @ 42".. The contract ratio is a little low "technically" but i honestly can't actually *tell* a different between it and the Samsung 32" LCD 720P that it's replacing which has a 3000:1 contrast ratio.. The picture clarity difference between the two is astounding. 1080P is definitely the way to go.... 

$$;
Pros:. Pure awesomness and slightly Future proof. 
Cons:. Had to return the first one because of a couple of dead pixels. 
Summary:. This TV is great. Get it if you can.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up, simple to install, side mounted cable installation. Cheap as dirt $799 delivered for 42-inches. Great for bedroom or smaller rooms. 4 HDMI inputs. 
Cons:. Cheap cheezey remote. 60mHZ refresh. Picture markedly inferior to higher priced offerings.. 
Summary:. For less than $800 delivered you really can't ask for much more. A good solid set perfect for folks just making the jump from CRT to LCD. Good picture right out of the box and perfect for Luddites like my spouse. Takes more fiddling to "get right" the better sets but that's a minor quibble. What isn't is what'll happen in you drop the remote... sheee ya!!! How flimsy can you git. Overall a good but not great product.. Updated. on Feb 17, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Just paid $750 at Best Buy and am VERY happy with purchase. Picture looks great, all the inputs I could ask for, and when I hook up one of my computers, It looks wonderful.. 
Cons:. Blacks not quite on par with the best TVs. But those TVs cost a hell of a lot more. I haven't run the calibration DVD yet, so I expect it to get better after that.. 
Summary:. If you are looking at a cheap HDTV, and don't demand absolute perfection, this one will not dissapoint you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive, 1080p, 4 hdmi inputs, good sound. 
Cons:. needs to be reset after a while. 
Summary:. I have had this tv for about a half a year now and have loved having a tv this big for under a grand. Overall the picture is near perfect, sometimes the blacks don't get as dark as I feel they should but it's not drastically noticeable. This tv has a lot of inputs! 4 hdmi, 2 sets of component, vga and more. The only problem I've had with this set is that after 5-6 months of use the hdmi connections started failing, then all my inputs wouldn't read. The only solution I found after messing with cables was to unplug and reset it and now everything works fine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great 1080p HD and SDTV output! Multiple HD inputs. 
Cons:. Needs a bit darker black levels? otherwise none really. 
Summary:. After reading all of the previous posts, i would like to skip the redundant content on them and go with my setup and thoughts on them.. Xbox 360 Connected to HD VGA cable - Output is excellent makes my upconverting DVDs seem like I don't need to make the jump to Blu Ray/HD-DVD. VGA connection supports up to 1080p.. Nintendo Wii - Connected Via aftermarket component cable - I see a huge boost in performance through the Legend of Zelda when set to 480p.. HD Cable connected via HDMI (Local Cable Provider) - My cable company outputs at 1080i and the HD content when certain channels choose to broadcast in HD looks great. Standard Definition at 480p looks good too but obviously not as good as 1080i.. Black levels could be better but that is expected with LCD technology. If one is that anal about black levels, than you should probably look for a really good plasma TV.. I did not see any blurryness that one user was talking about and i had really fast paced action movies playing (Matrix/V for Vendetta etc.). Overall very happy as this is my first HDTV purchase. I think this is has the best price vs performance ratio on the market.. I have not tested the speakers on the TV as I have connected all devices to my AV receiver.. A great display for gaming. Gears of War looks phenomenal on this TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, 1080P, 4 HDMI inputs, Sound--&gt; subwoofer built in. 
Cons:. Some blurring during fast motion, Lack of formats. 
Summary:. I just picked this up a few days ago and have really been digging it since. I wanted to purchase the previous model (LVM-42W2), but was hesitant because the lack of a tuner, even though I don't use one. This one has a tuner along with all the features and still comes in at a bargain of a price. The number of inputs is quite impressive which should make this tv useful for many years to come. My brother had mocked me initially for going with an "off-brand" so to speak, but he was thoroughly impressed once he saw this in action. I will admit that the set looked pretty weak on the wall of Best Buy compared to more expensive sets, but I have read that they do that on purpose because the markup is much lower on a bargain tv.. The image quality looks great when the set is at home. I hooked up my computer to it through VGA (w/1080P support), but was sad to realize my Macbook does not output resolution that high. The picture still looked great and I could see using this as a huge computer monitor with no problem (which I intend to do) and it also did great with a downloaded copy of Disney Pixar's Cars.. Next up was the Nintendo Wii which I hooked up through component cables which also supports 1080P though the Wii only outputs to 480, maybe 720. Regardless, the picture looked great.. I am yet to feed this any true HD content, but I plan on hooking it up to my parent's HD DVR soon to really let it show off.. One of the nice features about this set is that it automatically detects when a device has been turned on and switches to that input (though it can be disabled). I read in reviews of the previous model (LVM-42W2) that the remote was terrible and had to be aimed directly at the receiver. This is not the case on this model, the remote works as well as any other I've used. The feature that still needs enhancement is the formatting. If you are getting a widescreen signal, it will be fine. If you are getting a 4:3 signal it will also be fine. You are going to run into problems when watching tv broadcast in 4:3 displaying a widescreen image (confusing?). I have not encountered this yet, but most widescreen tv's have more than 2 settings for display formatting. Not a big deal because it seems like everything is slowly switching to widescreen and you probably get HD cable if you are insisting on a set with 1080P. Other than that, the menu was easy to navigate and things seem logically arranged to me. I played around a bit with the color and teperature settings to what looked best to my eye, but I'm not much of an expert when it comes to this; I'll wait until some nerd on an AV forum posts the perfect settings.. The sound is very good for built in speakers and the built in subwoofer really helps. However, everyone knows the full HD experience requires a surround sound system.. All in all, this seems like a great set, especially when you consider the price. There are definitely nicer tvs out there, but this one will get the job done for a reasonable price. I did, however, purchase the 4 year maintenance plan because I am not sure how Westinghouse will perform in the long run. I don't worry too much about it as these sets are being carried by some reputable stores (see Abt Electronics).. 

$$;
Pros:. Like the design, New On Screen Menu, Speakers Nice &#38; way better than a Visio 42". 
Cons:. Currently no Codes for DirecTV Remote, Black Levels a Little Weak. 
Summary:. I am rating this brand new 2007 model of theirs an 8 mainly when taking into consideration the price based on my reasearch and experience. Only open question might be how reliable it will be longer term but that goes for just about anything.. I spent hours comparing specs/features, reviews, and prices of other 1080p LCDs in the $1000 price range and I kept coming back to this one. I actually first bought the Sony 37" KDL 720p Rear Projection but returned it because we could not stand the cooling fan noise and the fact the bulb life was rated at 8,000 hours ($150 to replace it) and the screen door effect was not much fun either on SDTV. I almost bought the 42" Vizio VU42FHDTV but picture quality seemed less vivid (it was connected to a Toshiba upscaling 1080i Dvd player showing Happy Feat movie at Costco) and Vizio's speakers are very weak and hollow sounding. Plus a lot of folks on the forums were having issues w/ the Vizio's for what it's worth. This Westy has a 10w subwoofer included and a 5 band equalizer built-in and several custom sound setting to choose from.. It looks like Westy has tried to listen to their critics of the past and made efforts to improve some things such as their On-screen Menu GUI is nicer and more user friendly and they have more adjustments to be made to settings. You may not know this but under one of the menu drop downs ("Settings") is a more advanced Video section ("Calibration") where you can play with Dynamic Contrast, 3d Comb Filter, and some other things people have complained Westy's did not have in the past as far as I can tell.. A couple of small things would be the black levels are hard to get right so far without sacrificing some brightness/quality. Blacks get a little washed out sometimes depending on source content. DirecTv Remote Control range and angle is a bit suspect. One must be almost straight on to the TV and within about 8 feet from what I find so far. Also, their picture scaling options are a bit limited and Fill Mode makes things a bit stretched when watching of course non HD content like a regular DirecTv 4:3 broadcast but i have seen other TV's like the Sony I returned for other reasons do a bit better job of the scaling.. We are quite happy just to watch Non HD content in Standard screen Mode (4:3) becuase the clarity is more defined yet picture is still big enough as this is a 42" Tv after all. This TV remembers your scaling mode based on your input mode.. Summary: Anyone considering a Flat Screen 1080p LCD in the $1,000 price range should give serious consideration to this one for its solid job of picture quality and features and i could not find a better value out there at the time of my purchase.. I can't wait to see how CNET reviews this one! Hmmm, wonder if I should have waited.. Thanks, Steve from Northern Virginia.

Pros:. 1080P, 4 HDMI connections, rock bottom price.. 
Cons:. Standard Broadcast viewing not on par with a Sony.. 
Summary:. While not a Sony for standard defination broadcast this Westy has true 1080P, four HDMI inputs along with two components inputs, VGA and other standard fare inputs. Excellent HDTV picture and my Progressive Scan DVD never looked so good. Overall this set is much better than I expected for a 42" LCD for only $1,234 from Best Buy. I like it better than my HDTV Toshiba and the 42" Vizio (LCD) crap lasted less than 24 hours before I returned it back to Home Depot. This Westinghouse TX-42F430S is a very decent HDTV (LCD) at a rock bottom commodity price! What do you want... Eggs in your beer?. 

$$;
Pros:. Price; Known name brand; 4 HDMI slots. 
Cons:. Stuck pixels. 
Summary:. I was enticed by Westinghouse's entry price for 1080p which was very, very affordable compared to other brands so I took the dive. The first one I purchased of this model had a blatantly obvious stuck pixel so I wound up returning it.. The second one I picked up also had a stuck pixel but small enough that I decided to live with it because the rest of the tv's features were great for the price. I also found that stuck pixels can be a common occurrence for LCD tv's so this isn't an issue necessarily limited to Westinghouse. All in all I've been very satisfied with my decision so far.. 

$$;
Pros:. Produces Excellent pictures with Blue Ray Dvds, great for HD Gaming with Playstation. 
Cons:. Watching standard def channels is awful, shallow black levels on SD channels.. 
Summary:. I got this TV while it was on sale for $998 at best buy, and I still do not see a better TV for its value and quality.. At first, I was a little iffy about the television while I was waiting for my HDTV receiver from Direct TV. Watching standard definition is not the greatest to say the least, but watching movies on a dvd made up for it (average quality). As already indicated, the black levels are very shallow and standard definition looks washed out.. Yesterday I brought the PS3 and I was ASTOUNDED at just how great playing HD games and Blue Ray movies were! The black levels in magically became crisp and dark, and I was not longer sitting there dissapointed, but throughly enjoying the movies. I am very pleased and now I have no regrets of making the purchase. If you are definitely getting the HD package from your cable or satellite provider, or plan on playing games and watching movies in HD, this is the best TV to get at an affordable price!.

Pros:. Wide view LCD screen, 1080p, 4 HDMI/HDCP inputs. 
Cons:. Built-in ATSC/ClearQAM tuner does not output the full digital 5.1 bitstream to the SPDIF optical output, only stereo. 
Summary:. I just purchased the TX-42F430S and so far it's high def video output is excellent even at close range. The HDMI inputs support HD 1080p from my computer's DVI output.. The internal NTSC/ATSC/ClearQAM tuner works OK for over the air broadcasts with one big audio issue - it does not output the full digital 5.1 bitstream to the SPDIF digital optical output, only stereo. This internal ATSC/QAM tuner/decoder design flaw means that HD 5.1 broadcast audio from the internal tuner comes out of the SPDIF digital output in 2.0 stereo when sent to a home theater receiver - not exactly the "State of the Art" digital audio performance expected from HD ATSC/QAM tuners. This problem should be considered a show-stopper by anyone intending to use the only the internal ATSC/QAM tuner to view HD 5.1 broadcasts. I am also awaiting a response from Westinghouse support about this issue.. But overall, the Westinghouse TX-42F430S LCD performs well as a 1080p HDMI/HDCP capable monitor, and is reasonably priced.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and easy to connect all the extra electronics to. 
Cons:. Big con when adding a stand alone blu-ray player. Got the Panasonic BD55 &#38; the HDMI didnt work. Come to find out Westinghouse uses a lower version of the HDMI software than P; long story short W does not support firmware upgrade. 
Summary:. Wanted to love this fairly priced tv but if I cant get true HD from my blu-ray movies whats the sense??? May have to end up 'gifting' this tv as a hand-me-down and replace it with a competitors product. Dont you think that if a company tries to put themselves squarely in the whole cutting edge HD field of competitors they would immediately make sure that the add-ons are going to be compatible??? They've certainly made it clear to me that they are looking for quick market share without thinking about the consumer after the sale. Too bad. They are losing a potential repeat consumer and creating bad buz with me being the squeeky wheel. Do those wheels still the grease these days? Not so sure based on the lack-luster response I got from Westinghouse today. No solution - not even a hint of one.. 

$$;
Pros:. love current tv. 
Cons:. No issues or problems with current westinghouse. 
Summary:. Question. Has anyone who has bought this TV and has Diretv had any issues with picture clarity or connectivity issues?. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price. Good performance. 
Cons:. Strange behavior, such as if the power goes out then comes back on, the TV turns on by it's self.. The HDMI input failed and will no longer accept a signal. Had to switch to a lower resolution until we can have it repaired.. 
Summary:. Overall unacceptable.. Good price. Good performance. POOR reliability. 

$$;
Pros:. Feature set, price, style. 
Cons:. Image quality, input switching, black detail level, customer support. 
Summary:. This TV seemed to good to be true with its feature set and price for this year. It was.. My friend owns Westinghouse's 42" 1080p monitor from last year, and frankly its much better then this unit. My TV suffered an overall poor picture quality that could be adjusted for.. Then I had several issues with my audio and input switching. Each call to WH involved long wait times, and a final resolution of "We can't help you, unless you send it in.". That is right, even under warranty WH expects all TV's 42" and up to be sent in by you the buyer, typically costing $50-100 depending on where you are assuming you have the box. If you don't have the original box, it will cost you more.. 

$$;
Pros:. Was a great TV before the motherboard fried.. 
Cons:. Unplugged and carefully moved while cleaning house, plugged in, and now I get a TV that will turn on, but LCD screen in blank. Reading AVS forums found its a typical problem. WESTINGHOUSE PROVIDED NO SUPPORT/EXPLANATION/OR EVEN REMORSE THAT TV DIED.. 
Summary:. This TV will die. Do not buy. Read forum out there on TV. Has an average life of 1.5 yrs before it crashes and burns.. 

$$;
Pros:. Seems like a good tv for the price.. 
Cons:. Poor quality. Impossible to find replacement parts for small time company.. 
Summary:. This tv lasted only 18 months before I had problems with it-no warranty after 1 year. After a repair company came out to look at it, they told me the power supply was bad but could not fix it because they couldn't find the replacement part. Westinghouse told me they don't distribute parts directly and after searching online with the companies they recommended I still couldn't find the part.. This tv may seem like a good deal but you take your chances with this company.. 

$$;
Pros:. very nice picture quality for inexpensive model. remote user friendly. 
Cons:. no pip. issues with hdmi "handshake". 
Summary:. purchased this model from BB 5 mths ago, had HDMI "handshake"issue,worked the first 2weeks I had it, after that never worked.Played through componet cables only,called Westinghouse tech support,they were not helpful at all, don't actually believe it is westy support , some other outfit.By all means by the extended warrenty, I called BB warrenty line,said I had a problem w/HDMI connection, called me back 4 days later and gave me confirmation number to return it, ( I,ve had this tv for 5 months ),never asked me anything else about issue I had, I think BB just wants to get these units out of circulation, don't see them in stores anymore, &#38; not advertised in ad paper anymore,. from reading forums, seems a lot of folks having same problem, some say Westy. knows they have a defective chip and won't do anything about it , BB was great, upgraded to Sony KDL-46V4100,gave me 200.00 off price and transfered my warrenty,With the Sony no HDMI issues at all through cable box or Blue ray,fantastic picture quality, I guess you get what you pay for !. 

$$;
Pros:. It was cheap, and there's a reason why - factory defects GALORE - read on. 
Cons:. HDMI inputs fail on a regular basis. It's not your input devices folks, it's a known issue with this (and other) Westinghouse tv's. Only way to fix is to unplug, wait, restart; then do the same with your input device. STEER CLEAR!!!!. 
Summary:. DO NOT purchase this defective product, no matter how cheaply you can buy it. Do a search on this model and see that there are thousands of people with the same problem...and with terrible results from contacting Westinghouse customer service. You will be saving yourself both $$$ and headache by avoiding this manufacturer.. 

$$;
Pros:. VERY CHEAP!!!. 
Cons:. EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY. 
Summary:. !!!!!DO NOT BUY WESTINGHOUSE LCDS!!!!!. DO THE RESEARCH YOU WILL FIND THAT I'M NOT ONLY THAT FEELS THIS WAY.. MINE BURNT OUT IN ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. NO HELP FROM WESTINGHOUSE, NO PARTS. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!. IF YOU HAVE TO GET A WESTINGHOUSE GET THE EXTENDED WARRANTY YOU'LL NEED IT!!!!.
