we have really liked kimpton hotels in other cities ( ink 48 in nyc is one of our faves ) .
they have the `` cool kid '' vibe , and often have pretty nice perks ( the drinks for $ 1 is a nice perk if they have it when you stay there -- 2 cocktails/night from the hotel bar for $ 1 added to the cost of the room .
the service/check in was great -- we got in early from our flight from the east coast , and we were able to check in right away .
the rooms are all very well-decorated .
you can tell that they put a lot into renovating the hotel .
however , my pet peeve is when hotels forget about renovating the bathroom ( leaving the old shower/tub combo ) -- i feel like with a little more effort they could make a nicer bathroom with large walk-in showers instead of the tub , which no one uses .
although the decor in the room was great , the beds were way too soft , so neither of us slept well .
also , the location is very close to union square , which is great -- in the center of the action , but you can definitely hear noise from the street .
they had a complimentary afternoon wine tasting ( my only gripe here is that the wine happened to be from australia , and of course , we were looking forward to tasting some good californian wines ) and in the am they have a complimentary coffee .
my husband and i will likely consider this . . .

my husband and i will likely consider this hotel again back in sf or perhaps another one of the kimptons.
