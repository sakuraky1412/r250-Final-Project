it is 5mins away from the airport , though this does not mean a lot of noise pollution as there are only a few flights during the day and none at night .
we went out of season , which i recommend as there are few queues and the restaurant booking is easy .
there are several bars , including a rum bar , which has a huge array of caribbean rums , all included in the price of your stay .
all in all , this is one of the very best resorts i have visited and i heartily recommend it , along with st. lucia in general .
however , there are three other , select , restaurants - one italian , one asian and one creole - also included in the price of the stay .
smoking is not permitted in the rooms , but is ok outside , where there are plenty of places to sit , some of which are under cover .
coconut bay is on the atlantic side of the island and the sea , although very warm , is rougher that that on the other , caribbean sea , side .
the main dining-room was huge , with an enormous selection of different foods to which you serve yourself .
the food in these was fantastic , worthy of a 4-star restaurant .
the staff are superb , always cheerful and helpful .
