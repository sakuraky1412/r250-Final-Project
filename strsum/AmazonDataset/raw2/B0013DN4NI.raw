This is a great little tool
I use to use a bigger Dewalt unit, which was nice, but bigger and heavier than needed
The Hitachi should be able to do 99% of what I did with my Dewalt
I was also impressed with how fast the batteries charge (40 minutes)
The build quality seems excellent
It comes with some bits (see photo I uploaded), two batteries, charger, and a plastic case
The LED lights are a plus
Note though, that this doesn't have two "speeds" like my older Dewalt does, having a driving speed and a drilling speed
This Hitachi may be a bit slow for drilling
