Pros:. great battery life, large, crisp, vibrant screen. 
Cons:. nothing this phone is great! Picked it over the HTC Incredible, Droids.. 
Summary:. Do yourself a favor and check out this phone. I used to have an Iphone 3G, and this phone kills it. The way you can access all the multiple screens and manage what is displayed on each screen is very unique , easy to use and heck it looks great.. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is awesome and that IS the part you're always looking at!. Ease of use- a previous Blackberry user. Fully customizable- even Bing search. Great Apps and Widgets available. 
Cons:. Didn't come with a calendar widget- had to get an app for a screen page calendar and not just a shortcut- no biggie.. Love a longer battery life- always more is better!. 
Summary:. Upgrade time with Verizon so we went to check out Droids. My husband and I immediately loved the Fascinate- you have to be literally blind not to. The screen differences are staggering. We liked the Droid X as well but knew I'd be looking at that screen all the time wondering how much more vibrant the Fascinate would of been. So even though the BOGO did not currently apply to two Fascinates and we like getting the same phones so we can share our "finds" as we figure them out, we got two.. We have been personalizing them for days and loving all the options. There are some really great apps out there that even will give you a google search widget if you want one if Bing is a major issue. We've tried LauncherPro, Pure Calendar (this gave me the calendar widget I wanted- I like a transparent full screen), aniPet Aquarium (this really does that screen justice with a live wallpaper of a marine aquarium that you customize the fish!), Handcent is a great texting app that allows you to adjust font colors, styles and background colors that look superb on the Fascinate. It does everything we hoped and we've tried it all. We were a little concerned about the 2g on board since the Droid X has 8g and the apps are not saved to external memory but it has been quick with no lag or slow downs. We have tons of other apps installed as well- just wanted to mention a few favorites :). Verizon is the only service I'll consider so the iphone for now, isn't an option. I'll wait to check those out after Verizon has had them a year of so.. When I heard that some people were giving this phone bad reviews I had to wonder if they had really used one before. All the sales people are the Verizon store loved it too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use. Quick response. Vibrant pictures and videos. voice recognition. Good tone when using the phone. Availability of apps for my generation.. 
Cons:. Once is awhile it freezes but always comes back. Other than that, I do not have any cons. 
Summary:. I am a Senior and this has been a wonderful experience for me to keep up with my grandchildren. It is a great, easy to learn android phone. You do need patience and it will reward you. I am able to text message very easily with this phone plus listen to Rhapsody etc. It has a great search feature on apps which helps us first time novices. I enjoy texting with the conversation type bubble threads. The voice recognition works well. I use it while I have it in the docking station (I recomment the docking station) I also recomment the digital clock app for those of you that have a hard time reading the analog clock (it is free) I also downloaded an app for caller ID announcement with state the name or number of the person calling and this is great for call screening and for those folks that have a hard time seeing the names (although the names come up in a great large font) All in all for a novice and a Senior, this is a great phone and I hope others of my age will not be scared to try it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally, a Samsung/Verison phone that really competes with the IPhone . Way better than my Blackberry Storm, the truly touch screen is fast and easy, lots of apps and very intuitive...didn't even really need to "learn" to use it. I'd give it an A+++.. 
Cons:. It eats the battery like kids eat popcorn.....but it does so much so well, this is a minor thing to deal with.. 
Summary:. Excellent, excellent phone, my kids are even jealous! Camera phone is outstanding, touch screen lets you fly with texting; I'd never go back to the press and click Blackberry Storm. it whips between apps, FABULOUS, bright, clear screen is self-adjusting in different levels of light, the quality of the sound during a call is perfect, it's amazingly lightweight and I couldn't be happier!! You got it right, this time Samsung...I swore off you after that disaster you called an Omnia, but you made up for it with this one!. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing Screen, Fast Processor, Beautiful Interface, Great Hardware, Great Battery Life. 
Cons:. GPS Issues. 
Summary:. This is an amazing phone. It is by far the best phone that I've ever owned. In my opinion, it's the best phone on the market right now. The battery life is exceptional. The SAMOLED screen is amazing. The interface is easy to use and absolutely beautiful. The hardware in this phone makes it so snappy and responsive. Call quality is clear.. The only issue that exists with this phone is the GPS is slow to obtain a lock on your position. Samsung promises an update for this though, and it has already started to roll out to other Galaxy S phones. It does run Android 2.1 for the time being, but there is a planned update for Android 2.2 anyway.. The bottom line is, this is an amazing piece of hardware. I have used this phone and compared to a Droid X, Droid Incredible, and a few Windows Phones. This is the best by far. It has the best screen, and is faster than any of those phones. It's a close comparison with the iPhone. The iPhone 4 has a slightly better screen, but this phone is much more customizable than an iPhone. Seeing as the iPhone is not available on Verizon, this is at the top of Verizon's lineup.. 

$$;
Pros:. BEAUTIFUL display, very responsive interface, intuitive design. Very fast when loading webpages and manipulating them. SWYPE feature is awesome for texting and emailing, voice to text also works amazingly well.. 
Cons:. Battery life can be a problem depending on what apps you run and for how long.. 
Summary:. My previous phone was the HTC Imagio, a truly horrible experience. I researched the top Droid phones and had decided to go with the HTC Incredible. The sales guy strongly recommended the Samsung Fascinate. I hadn't even heard of it at that point. I liked what I saw but decided to go home and do some more research. Most of the reviews were crying about the Bing situation which was already resolved so I decided to take the plunge. I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH THIS PHONE! I've yet to find something I don't like. The sales guy switched it over to all Google so the bing thing was never a problem for me. I've got a ton of apps that all work great and I even moved my music catalog over to the SD card so it's also working as a nice MP3 player. It's also a whole lot lighter than my old HTC, I'm not sure how it compares to the other androids.. I'm looking forward to the upgrade to 2.2 Froyo, based on how fast this phone is now and the improvement that people have seen in the upgrade on other androids I can only imagine just how fast this phone will be.. The SWYPE feature is awesome. Sending texts is so much quicker with this feature versus typing. I've also had great results with the voice to text function. Great when you're driving and you need to send a quick text.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the layout and ease of use; apps are fun; touch screen is easy to use; image is clear and precise; most areas have full range of services. 
Cons:. Friends connect part is confusing and difficult to set up; some of the pre-loaded apps don't work unless you pay premium fees; GPS is extremely innacurate; cannot use google as search engine; camera image is frequently blurry. 
Summary:. As a competitor to the iphone, this is a step up for Verizon users and less bulky than the giant Droid X, which I found impossible to pocket due to its width (they don't make pockets that wide). The Fascinate screen is larger and brighter than my friend's iphone. In fact, once he used my phone, he wanted to trade his iphone in and buy a Fascinate. This is a huge improvement over the LG phone we had with Verizon. Despite the drawbacks, I highly recommend this product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, brillant screen, responsive, perfect size (screen not as big as the Droid X--too big--not too small).. 
Cons:. GPS...known issue getting a satellite lock. Samsung/Verizon is aware and are working on a fax--however, with that said, I don't experience problems...just take time to get a lock. Not a deal breaker!!!!. 
Summary:. I said it was the best Android phone on the Verizon network and I meant it. I owned the Droid 1 &#38; Eris and by far, this phone is the best one I've own so far. It's fast, responsive, sleek and quit frankly, good looking. Compared to the oversized,weird looking Droid X, weird back to the Incredible, this phone has the cleanest lines. I compared this to the iPhone 4, and in my opinion, it was bigger, more responsive and had a brighter/clearer display. As for the Bing search, BIG DEAL!!! Bing, first of all, isn't that bad. Plus, like others said, create a shortcut to Google. Camera is very quick and responsive with a lot of different options. Out of the 4 or 5 Droid phones on Verizon (Droid X, Droid 1&#38; 2, Incredible)...trust me, pick this phone. I bought one for myself and went back out and bought a second for my wife. Hands down, excellent phone. Disregard all the 1 star haters!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. beautiful screen, swype capability, android system, easy navagation through phone. 
Cons:. stutters sometime but nothing you notice, bing defaulted but you can can change easily.. 
Summary:. everyone who thin ks oyu dont have 2.2. go to settings updates i think it was and download you can update manually to 2.2 froyo. its an awesome phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. -Huge Screen. -GREAT SCREEN. -Awesome photo/video quality. -Relatively good battery life once it gets conditioned. -Really easy to transition from a regular phone to this phone. EVERYTHING is awesome about this phone. 
Cons:. Having the minor freakout when you see bing and the weird menu icons. 
Summary:. If you aren't getting this phone because of Bing, then that's not a good reason. If you download launcherpro (which is free, by the way) it overrides bing and applies the google search box and the android menu style. this only gives you 3 screens, but I'm just okay with one. This has minor lags and hiccups, which will all be fixed with the update. still waiting for flash though. phone is great, definitely a good buy, especially with an upgrade credit and the mail in rebate.. 

$$;
Pros:. swype keyboard is awesome, i can type faster on this phone than on a real keyboard. Also the screen is awesome and the phone is very fast when browsing the web or just going from one app to another.. 
Cons:. Bing being the default searcher sucks but everybody is saying google search will be available when the 2.2 update comes out.. 
Summary:. This is the nicest phone I have ever seen, nicer than the iphone. There are way to many good features to overcome the whole bing situation. The screen is so bright and good size, HD video cam is awesome, and the swype keyboard is genious!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Phone, Interface, Options, Etc.. 
Cons:. Sluggish at times.. 
Summary:. Traded in my Iphone for this baby. Its not quite as good as a iPhone, or maybe I'm just not used to it. However, unlike the iPhone, I can make calls with this!. 

$$;
Pros:. - Hummingbird processor is the fastest of all the processors available.. - Best of all the Screens. Especially, videos look stunning!. - Lightweight and compact. The phone feels so much better than others, both in pocket and hand.. - Best Music Player. .. 
Cons:. - GPS is slow, but not a deal breaker, for sure.. 
Summary:. Best Customized / modified android phone. You can add / remove screens, rearrange the screens, make any as your home screen. Delete apps right from the icons, hitting the small red icon on top. A music player in the notification bar. Some of Samsung widgets are great. I find all these customizations awesome!. Samsung has done really a great job in modifying the interface and making it cool. And, this review is coming from an experienced android phone user who used most of the earlier models, Motorola Droid, HTC Eris, etc.. - Lock button on the right side. Best for holding the phone with one hand, in your palm.. - Amazing sound quality while playing music and video, especially when you are wearing a headphone. You can actually feel sound moving from one ear to the other. - Best of all the Android Music players available - even better than the paid ones like MIxzing, Lithium, etc.. - This might be just me, but I find Bing to be really good, except for the map. For that and navigation, you can just download the Google maps from market. I suggest the users to give Bing a chance, you will like it.. This is for the users who write reviews without owning one. Please don't write a review about a phone before owning one! Samsung has made such an awesome phone and you guys complain about it instead of appreciating it. Samsung has customized the phone so well to make it more user friendly, so that WE can love it. It has taken into consideration most of the problems I had with a normal android phone and made the fascinate so well. I feel so bad to see the user review of the phone at three stars when it is faster and better than most of the android phones available. I own this phone for nearly a week now and I love it. Great job Samsung!. Just think about it guys, the phone hit the stores on 9th and people started reviewing it even before the launch date!! Please ignore these kind of reviews.. 

$$;
Pros:. First touchscreen phone I owned, and I simply love it. Call clarity is amazing, no duped calls yet. Works where my other phones have. Those who give it 1 star for having bing locked? Wow...get real and give it a more proper rating.. 
Cons:. Too much.... 
Summary:. Best phone I have EVER owned. Bottom line.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing does not describe the screen well enough. Very fast processor. Camera actually takes better quality than most 8mp camera-phones. Samsung widgets look better than other manufacturer widgets. 16 GB Memory card pre-installed. 
Cons:. Bing is default search engine. No LED indicator. That's about it.. 
Summary:. At first I was deterred from purchasing this phone due to Bing being the default search feature. But then I found a work around. You can download Google Maps from the Android Market and this dumps "Google Maps", "Google Navigation" AND "Google Places" into the phone (three apps for one!) They're all free.. Once Google Navigation is dumped in from the market you can place the shortcut on your homescreen and use that instead of the pre-installed junk. I was a much happier person once I figured this out. (I also saved Google as a bookmark and then saved the bookmark shortcut onto my home screen, voila, no more BING!). My second gripe was no LED indicator. But once again I found another workaround. There is an app in the market called "NoLED" which places a small colored square on the screen whenever the screen is black and the box bounces around in the top left corner whenever there is a missed text, missed call, email, etc. Preferences can be set for this little colored box. Voila, LED problem solved.. I love this phone. I was so excited to switch from my Droid 1 to this. SUCH an amazing phone!. (And the haters need to read this to realize there are workarounds!). 

$$;
Pros:. I admit that I've only had it for a little bit, but I am absolutely stunned at the capability of this phone. Of course, I came from a stupid little prepaid flip-phone, but still -- its great.. The phone seems very responsive, and I love the screen.. 
Cons:. I suppose defaulting to bing is somewhat of a failure, but its minor. Really people, grow up. A search engine to me is just that. I can't believe people would rate this phone 1 star just because of the bing search.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super AMOLED screen, good pictures and video, extremely fast, GREAT phone!. 
Cons:. Bing, no dedicated camera button. 
Summary:. !!WARNING!!. Don't listen to "Mikedeezy33"!. !!WARNING!!. First off he posted two days before the phone came out, there's no way he could of been telling the truth to begin with.. "1. Bing is default search, NO choice as to changing it. The search is awful!". ---NOT TRUE!. Android 2.2 will give you option of changing it.. "2. Google navigation disabled.". --NOT TRUE!. I was using it fine today and in fact it came with Google Navigation!. "3. GPS does not work.". --NOT TRUE!. Works fine, but did take a few minutes to get satellites - bug fix coming in android 2.2. "4. Phone is laggy.". --NOT TRUE!. This phone features a Hummingbird 1.0GHz processor, which produces amazing graphics compared to all the Droids.. "5. Poor software support from Samsung". --NOT TRUE!. Although Samsung is a bit slow, they do release updates.. My Omnia 2 has been updated at least 2-3 times in my 4 month of ownership.. Don't listen to idiots!. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen, weight, HD video recording, user interface is pleasantly nice, overall size, processor. 
Cons:. required bing search (definitely not a deal breaker). 
Summary:. I just bought the phone yesterday at the Verizon store as I upgraded from the Droid eris. I was pleasantly surprised to see this "iphone like" phone sitting int he store. I had all intentions on buying the Droid X but since Motorola can't seem to keep up with demand I chose the Fascinate. I am very impressed with the speed of the phone and love the simple design. Overall this phone is a great choice if your looking for a strong Android phone which is light and has a beautiful screen. Also allows every app I downloaded on my Eris including Google Navigator. http://www.myphonedied.com. 

$$;
Pros:. This is by far the best Android phone ever. period.. 
Cons:. Basically Verizon wast clear enough regarding this Bing thing and stupid people are over-exaggerating how they feel "raped" because they are "forced" to use Bing-everything or verizon navigation. NOT TRUE. 
Summary:. Bing Bing Bing. Stop crying people and stop speading wrong information. Yes, Bing is the default search engine. NO, you are NOT FORCED to use it. If you actually have this phone and care to tweak things a bit, you can go Google-everything. I got this phone yesterday and first thing I did, sent Bing-everything to trash. Yes I know it's still there but at least you don't see it on your phone. Now you just need to download google map, navigation, etc and put the icons on your home screen. This phone also comes preloaded with "voice search", which you will find on your apps page. You also put that icon on your home if you'd like. You click it once, it says "speak now: google search" and it will go directly to google. I don't know why people are spreading craps like search will be redirected to Bing! If you don't like voice search then you set google.com as your browser home. is it that difficult? I click my map or navigation and they are google too. I just came back from a restaurant 20 minutes away from my house using the google nav and it worked great! Seriously, if you don't have this phone and you've been just reading crap on internet do not rate this phone. It's just a search engine people. and it's MODIFIABLE. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing screen, fast, easy to use, flash on the camera, sleek design.. 
Cons:. The default search engine is Bing. But, that's something I can live with.. 
Summary:. It just has everything I could imagine that I would want in a phone. HD video recorder, camera with flash, sleak and thin design, solid construction, great for texting, 4" screen that is insanely clear, swype, and on and on. It's just the perfect phone for a decent price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast Humming Bird Processor. 
Cons:. Bing Locked. 
Summary:. GUYS STOP whining to Samsung about locking out other search providers. Smartphone itself is very nice, complain to Verizon for locking in with BIng.. 

$$;
Pros:. S-Amoled android camera Processor.....just everything. 
Cons:. None....... 
Summary:. The phone is fast great and I like how slim and responsive it is......for you idiots who are giving it a bad review because of bing, grow up...OMG BING?!? F-That i hate this phone jeez i could kill myself! get real its a phone....not the ultimate search machine. this is a great buy...better than droid X with its horrible lcd display! btw the gps does work, the samsung support does not suck and the phone is not laggy at all....stop assuming things and talk to me when you learn something about phones.. 

$$;
Pros:. GALAXY S (which means AMOLED screen, awesome day and night camera, great HD video, fastest video card on any smartphone for amazing gaming). Rear flash, Hotspot, Verizon Network, slim, light weight.. 
Cons:. no front camera, no keyboard.. 
Summary:. http://liberalpr.blogspot.com/2010_09_01_archive.html#8862598918549931212. Best of the best. The Galaxy phone is the best phone out there and this phone,while not the best (EPIC is), its 2nd. But the network (verizon) matters when it comes to cell phones and Verizon is in front of Nascar (Sprint ing) by a longshot.. 

$$;
Pros:. try it first and write the real review. 
Cons:. ............ 
Summary:. people please write review after hands on. 

$$;
Pros:. Android. 3G Mobile Hotspot. Skype Mobile. Visual Voice Mail. Camera 5.0 Megapixel. WiFi: 802.11 b/g/n. 
Cons:. Nothing so far.. 
Summary:. Phone just launched, there are ways around being locked to Bing and even so, I'm not such a fanboy that I would think it's a dealbreaker.... 

$$;
Pros:. Swype, speech to text, apps, screen resolution, PANDORA, live wallpaper.. 
Cons:. Wish there was a better user manual. 
Summary:. I use a BB 9300 for work, and was in dire need of an update of my personal phone (had ATT Nokia E71x). The screen is truly amazing and I love some of the live wallpapers with their zen-like qualities. I'm not a huge touchscreen user (I occasionally play games on my Apple I Touch) and I admit: I was reluctant to get a phone without a physical keyboard but SWYPE and speech-to-text alleviated my fears- it's the lazy-man's way of texting/emailing but I LOVE it. PANDORA is awesome! Sound quality is so so- but let's face it: it's a phone speaker not a Dolby system. I've used the camera and the pictures are crisp. Haven't used the video yet.So many features that I'm trying to learn how to use- and the user manual isn't really that great. I'm having fun discovering what my Fascinate can do, My teenager- who has an I Phone is totally jealous now!. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed is a plus. using the phone and messaging is easy to use. Downloads are decently quick.. 
Cons:. you can only have one corporate email account. Complex to learn how to program everything but easy once you learn it.. 
Summary:. Functionality takes a little time to learn how to use it. I've had a Blackberry for the past 5 yrs and the Fascinate is harder to use. Once I got the hang of it I can manipulate all the pages to meet my needs and it's easy to use. One negative is all the pre-loaded apps. It screws your phone up if you try to take them off. All in all, best phone I've ever had.. 

$$;
Pros:. Brilliant display, sleek and elegant, user-friendly interface is like an iPhone, fast processor for downloading. 
Cons:. GPS limitations, sometimes the keyboard freezes in Wi-Fi zones. 
Summary:. I waited for the iPhone to come to Verizon for more than a year, but refused to switch to AT&#38;T. The Samsung Galaxy S is the closest thing to the iPhone available on the market, and is a major threat to Apple's dominance. I'm still in the 30 day trial period, and like the Android applications and access to Gmail. It was available for free during the "Free Fridays" promotion at Best Buy. My guess is a new, improved version of this phone will be coming out in 2011 and will go head-to-head with Apple's iPhone. If you refuse to switch from Verizon to AT&#38;T, but have been waiting patiently for an iPhone, this one is worth serious consideration.. 

$$;
Pros:. I am so impressed with this phone... actually calling it a phone is an insult to it... it does everything! Super fast, great AMOLED screen, GPS, fast browser, works like a dream.... 
Cons:. Battery life.... although they now have an extended battery.. which once I have then I will be totally content... 
Summary:. Great smart phone... replaces my itouch and my camera... there is an mp3 ap to get free music, pandora radio ap rocks, super powerful, I wish my laptop worked this well... Great for social media.. everything I ever wanted in a phone and more.... 

$$;
Pros:. This screen is incredible, clarity and brightness.. Mobile Hotspot appears optimized - quite Fast!. Swype input works very well, when you don't have the ability for voice recognition to text.. Facebook feeds and agenda desktops are superb.. 
Cons:. Bing. Not a fan of a locked down search. Verizon has already said it will make this a choice, but for now, it's a lockdown. But you can still browse over to Google.com and do what you need.. Slightly less reception ability than my Droid.. 
Summary:. I have been blown away with this Samsung. Very impressive phone. To me, this phone is thin, light, fast, and has all of the functions I need and want in a Smart Phone. The apps are great, right out of the box.. Additional info - the plus side. The screen is simply the best screen I have ever seen. I don't need my glasses, for almost every view, and the multi touch web pages takes care of any issue I have.. Speed - this thing runs apps. The battery life has been very good for me. I easily get through a day on it, and I am NOT using any third party app killer.. Phone - yes, it rivals my Droid in call quality. Very good.. Bluetooth compatibility - sync with Motorokr was flawless, and all functions work well.. The Mobile Hotspot works well. easy setup and overall quite a nice feature. Verizon appears to have optimized this function well for the Samsung, because it's by far faster web through the mobile hotspot than I get with the phone service alone (seen consistentl in download speeds). This is not definitive, but I think testing would show this.. Swype input rocks! Very easy, quick learning curve. definitely the easiest backup if you are in a noisy area and can't use voice to text.. Cons - Alike many reviewers here, I'm not a fan of Bing. More so, I am not a fan of MS, but that aside, I like choice. Verizon has already gone public with correcting this phone to allow selecting a search engine. Once that is fixed, it's a 5 star phone, in my book!. I also have a Droid. Looking only at the meters on the phones for signal, the Droid often has an additional bar compared to the Samsung. I haven't had any reception issues or dropped calls, so that part may just be an algorithm.. All in all, I would highly recommend this phone. I am 100% satisfied with the performance and amazed at the speed and functionality.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, very snappy, great sound quality, beautiful picture quality (both on screen and through camera), Swype pre-installed. 
Cons:. Flimsy back (easy fix), locked to Bing! search engine (easy fix/work-around), GPS still has issues, comes with Android 2.1 (2.2 due later in September, according to rumor). 
Summary:. This phone is very impressive, right out of the box. It has a 1Ghz Hummingbird processor AND a Hummingbird GPU. This means that the games that are preinstalled, and the games you can get off the market, look great with smooth edges and little, if any, lag (I have had no lag at all, but have heard some people complain about it). The screen is large and roomy without feeling like I'm holding a big-screen TV in my pocket. The buttons are easy to get to with one hand, and swype makes it so much easier and faster to type with one hand (allowing me to hold my caffine of choice in my other hand). Samsung's UI looks and works great, but I installed ADW.Launcher, since I personally prefer that UI. The phone is locked to Bing!, but I didn't mark it down for that. I installed Google Maps and Navigator, removed the Bing! bar (in fact, I removed ALL the widgets; I don't like having widgets on my screens. I like to see the wallpaper LOL), and set Google as my browser home page. In all, it took less than 5 minutes to do all that, and I never see Bing! when I run a search.. Now, here is the main issue: the GPS. I left it on, trying to get a lock, for 15 minutes, and still couldn't get it to lock in on my position. It got in the general vacinity (within 2500 feet), but wouldn't lock in on my position. After some research, I found a fix that may work, but also found that Samsung is testing a fix for this, too. It should roll out with Froyo later this month. Once that issue gets fixed, this phone will easily warrant 5 stars.. On the flimsy back comment: the battery cover of the phone is flimsy plastic, easily prone to cracking if dropped. This was easily fixed by a simple case. I'm not looking for a bullet-proof phone, after all. I came from a Moto Droid, and this phone is worlds better. I had my Droid overclocked to 1.25GHz, and this phone, at stock speeds, is still more responsive that the Droid was. Don't get me wrong, though, the Droid is a great phone. The Fascinate is just better.. 

$$;
Pros:. just as quick as droid 2 , alot lighter , better resolutions beatiful phone no problems. 
Cons:. that it wasn't out sooner. 
Summary:. If you want a great phone and not hull around a brick buy you will not be disappointed. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen is gorgeous, great battery life, responsive, fast.. 
Cons:. The Samsung software takes some getting used to/. 
Summary:. I took my time and researched before I decided on this phone. It came down to the Fascinate or the Droid X with the deciding factors being that the X is hard to get and would not fit comfortably in my pocket. I am glad I chose the Samsung and honestly don't understand the negative reviews. Search engine was not much of a factor for me and I can use Google search through the browser. I was able to install Google navigator before I left the Verizon store and was up &#38; running in no time. The Samsung software while not for everyone works well for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Browsing experience is phenomenal. Typing is easy even for people with big thumbs, just takes practice. Email is easy to setup. Screen is most excellent.. 
Cons:. I don't like Bing, I want the option of using the search engine of my choice. Does not have a native Password Keeper. Can't sync MS Outlook to it.. 
Summary:. I've had it for 5 days now and I have to say that the biggest problem I have is determining what apps I want to download. Since you can't store them on your microSD card "yet" you have to pick and choose. The internet experience is light years ahead of Blackberry. Figure if you have to pay for a data package you might as well get something that will scratch both itches, web and email. Not just the email. Sorry RIM, you haven't been left behind, but you've given me few reasons to stay. May be back in a couple of years if you start showing the customer things they want. So for now, bye bye Blackberry, Hello Android. Almost forgot, learning curve is seemless. Few hiccups here and there, but nothing that can't easily be overcome. 4.5 Stars, because nothing is perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Overall I really like the Fascinate! It is a fast phone with an amazing screen. The form factor is very nice and the phone is fairly light for its size. It is mostly responsive and extremely snappy with just about everything it is asked to do!. 
Cons:. The biggest cons for this device are more issues with Verizon business decisions but are all more than surmountable (and most already have been). Bing as a default search with no option or choice was a dumb decision by verizon.. 
Summary:. All in all the Fascinate is a great addition to the VZW line of phones. It's biggest flaw is that it ships with 2.1 instead of 2.2 however with an update promised before years end (if it happens) it could potentially remove the other biggest flaw. That is the phone is basically locked and defaulted to Bing!.... Stupid business move I'm sure they did for a myriad of reasons.. The phone itself even on 2.1 is very fast, the screen really is beyond compare. It is vibrant, accurate and just stunning. The phones processor chews through anything you can throw at it. The button placement has taken a little getting used to coming from a Droid 1.. The software so far has been the only real big fault I have seen with the device. As I said before these are surmountable. The Android community which if you carry the device you should really at least look into, has found various work arounds to full blown corrections. Some of course are more invasive than others.. The 2.2 update is said to help correct these issues by bringing google back to the phone and it be an option to choose which service is used. If that holds true then I'd say amends made and we can all move on.. Should the software quarks hold you back, no if you've been on the fence for a new model android phone then pull the trigger I think you'd be hard pressed to go wrong with this device.. 

$$;
Pros:. . it has all the pros of the iphone. To address the 'bing' issue. Its not. Set your browser homepage to google, bam google. The Voice search defaults to google. It is a fast and very light weight phone. Love the swype texting.. 
Cons:. Battery life runs out a little quickly. Disable the interactive wall paper and save battery.. 
Summary:. Bottom-line is this is the best phone on the android market, and quite frankly its better than an iphone.. 

$$;
Pros:. overall great qualities in every category. 
Cons:. i wish that bing would not be on this phone.. 
Summary:. bing sucks. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone is very easy to use and has many features.. 
Cons:. It is a great phone and you will love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. No lag, beautiful bright screen, easy to operate. It takes sharp, well-lit pictures. Internet and phone call quality are sharp. I wasn't that impressed by the screens of the X, and I did not like the heft of the Droid 2. I am glad I waited.. 
Cons:. The battery life is weak (must be that bright screen!).. Transferring contacts and calendar from my Blackberry has been time consuming. I have not figured out how to manage my numerous daily emails as easily as the Blackberry did (any tips?.. 
Summary:. After a day of getting to know it, I freaking love it. It has required more attention than my Blackberry during work hours, which isn't good. Gotta make that dollar, dollar bill yo.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use right out of the box. I'm a first-time Android user.. Gorgeous screen. Even makes pics taken with my crappy old phone look great.. I love the slim size. It will fit nicely in my pocket when I don't have a handbag with me.. 
Cons:. There's some kind of issue with my verizon.net email address, ironically.. 
Summary:. I went to the Verizon store to get a Droid X last night because my old Dare touchscreen stopped working(been waiting for this mistake to die for a long time). The Droid X was on a 10 day backorder., and I didn't want to be without a phone that long. I looked at the Fascinate, and I just fell in love. It's so easy to use. The touch screen is very responsive, and I absolutely adore the Swype texting. I like that it's big, but not humongous like the Droid X. It fits perfectly in my hands.. I'm not much of a techie, and I don't really understand what the big deal is about Bing. It's easy enough to get to Google. I wouldn't let these poor reviews of the phone just because it's locked to Bing influence my decision, even if I'd read them before I bought it. It's quick when online and emailing. I think I'm going to be very happy with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. The graphics are awesome, the speed terrific &#38; my browser..Google!! The phone is NOT rooted &#38; you can set your own preferences! Update to 2.2 the end of September, Awesome!. 
Cons:. Stuck with 2.1 at this time and thats still good with the Hummingbird, Bloatware that constantly runs on the background and cant be removed without rooting, skype, city id, etc. Never have like pushy people!!!!!!!. 
Summary:. Took the chance of getting rid of my Droid Inc. and Im not at all disappointed! The Fascinate truly fascinates, and Im not easliy swayed, as the prior owner of Moto Droid, Storm, HTC's and also living with an Iphone user, this phone is beautiful, full of potential, and not to mention there is fianlly a phone with Verizon that actually looks like it belongs with a woman!!! YAY. 

$$;
Pros:. great screen, amazing speed, nice aesthetics. 
Cons:. all plastic :-/ useless bing maps compared to google navigation, the widgets, touchwiz UI. 
Summary:. an excellent phone and its a bogo! tested it at work and ordered mine at 12:02! not crazy about the bing search defaults but its a search engine-as long as it finds my answer i'm good. speaker volume is great compared to some other models and the gaming support leaves little to be desired by any user! even youtube looks good on this thing! to top it all off its one a few android devices with drm support so your rhapsody subscription just became useful again.. downsides:. -bing maps. -touchwiz makes it look like just another samsung phone. -menu keys. -memory. so for all those who went to the store and reps who just got their training packets and read that one part and ran to the computer get a grip. you would be qualified to write a review if you would spend a little more time with the device and looked at it for what it is. really people-if it was so horrible you wouldnt have gone all the way to your local store, waited for those kids to move away before you got to touch the phone for 4-7 minutes. admit it-it you did all of that just to touch the phone which you really know you wanna buy then complain that it uses bing instead of google you're gonna be calling tech support quite a bit. you may want to look into getting a Pi phone.... :-D. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice Display, Has a flash unlike cousins, great for starting Androiders, Fast processer, Good Features.. 
Cons:. GPS Location, Boring design. 
Summary:. Great for Noobs who need to learn and in general good for most people. 

$$;
Pros:. form factor - perfect size in hand and screen is still big. screen - way brighter than any verizon phone, especially outdoors. speaker - sounds pretty nice - calls &#38; music. camera - takes a decent shot, haven't tried video yet. 
Cons:. bing - you can easily make a google shortcut which is the same 1-button click as you would use for a built in widget, but if people want to make a huge deal out of it, i'll be glad to be one of the few people sporting this phone. 
Summary:. This phone is the closest thing you get to the iphone in size, weight, and quality. if you don't mind a huge phone, and want a nice, big screen - droid x may be the way to go, but as far as small, functional smartphones, this makes the incredible look uncredible.. 

$$;
Pros:. easily set up, gmail contacts are instantly there, fast processor. 
Cons:. email sucks, needs an aftermarket app (k9 mail) works great. Groups set up for phone impossible. 
Summary:. Clean, well desinged, easy to manage. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size, touch screen.. 
Cons:. Can't save apps to SD card.. 
Summary:. Very happy with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous screen, perfectly sized for the front pocket, nice and light (for said pocket), rocking good cpu/gpu combination, loud speaker and earpiece volumes.. 
Cons:. GPS is beyond unreliable, locks sometime take as long as 7-10 minutes outdoors. "GPS Fix" from Verizon does nothing to alleviate the problem. The phone comes locked to Bing and VZ Navigator, but can easily be changed from both.. 
Summary:. I decided to make the leap to Android from WinMo (owned devices of every WinMo flavor from 3 to 6.5) and I picked the fascinate for two big reasons: It's not locked like the Droid X and Droid 2 so you can install cooked ROMS and the hardware rivals both droids for a significant discount provided you buy your phone somewhere that isn't Verizon. I have not been disappointed.. Initial learning curve was steep for me, since it is my first Android device, but after a day or so I've found the touch keyboard to be very intuitive and the performance to be, well, extraordinary. The phone never lags or hangs on websites or games and I consitently have 6-12 applications open at a time. My only complaint is the abysmal GPS reliability. While there have been promised fixes and patches, nothing has made my phone lock on with any speed, or really at all while indoors. I don't consider this a fatal flaw, but I do think it warrants mention, since so many reviews have glossed over this glaring issue. Other than that, it smokes my wife's Droid 2 in almost all respects other than GPS, including browsing speed and application load times.. Updated. on Oct 23, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything!. 
Cons:. Not really any. 
Summary:. I'm so happy with my new unlocked cell phones! This has an unbelievably fast processor, great feel and easy to text on. I used to own a unlocked htc phones, but I'm so much happier with my brand new unlocked samsung phones. This Samsung Fascinate is so much better for my business and pulls my email in so much faster. And I really couldn't be happier with it since it is an unlocked�tmobile phones and it's a unlocked 3g phones I can take it overseas. My family loves my new phone and can't get enough of the games. I'm going to purchase another one for my son for his birthday from gsmauthority.com. Definitely would recommend this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. sick screen, best ever..... 
Cons:. plastic parts, volume keys that rattle when you move the phone (ugh!!!). 
Summary:. Overall very impressive Iphone alternative.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is awesome, very easy to use touch screen, sounds great in headphones, a lot lighter and thinner than my old phone!. 
Cons:. Software does stutter a little bit. Nav buttons at the bottom dim after a few seconds!. 
Summary:. This is an upgrade from my Samsung Jack and I gotta tell ya, anything is an improvement! Watching videos is very nice. Too bad there is no a/v out to show on a big screen for presentations, etc. I like the big area to view websites and it doesn't feel too bulky or heavy to handle.. I am a little annoyed that the only instructions I got were a 10 page pamphlet, especially being new to using a touch screen phone. You can download the full manual online though. There were a few hiccups when going into programs. It wasn't a huge deal but something I could see giving me problems the more memory is used over time.. The one thing that really bums me out though is the nav buttons at the bottom dim after about 20 seconds. You cannot find the buttons when you're in the dark and have to guess where things are at. I couldn't find an option to increase the time on that but maybe that'll be in the update.. In all, I'd say it's a good phone for someone wanting to switch to sans-buttons. I have to overcome my OCD of seeing a smeary screen all the time, but its a good experience. Hopefully, this phone will last me a good 5 years and do better than what the Jack could do.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic user interface with Android 2.1, really looking forward to the 2.2 update as well as 3.0. The screen is just gorgeous. Very light-weight and a great size. Great camera. 
Cons:. Buttons on the bottom don't stay lit when the phone is in use (really, really frustrating in low-light). I can hear the reverberation of my voice on the internal parts when I talk on the phone. 
Summary:. I was getting extremely tired of AT&#38;T's service. So when it came time to add a line to my plan, I, sadly, broke up with my iPhone and headed over to Verizon. To be honest, if I was going to get a new phone I felt like upgrading to the iPhone 4 wasn't worth it, I should atleast try out something new. I think the Fascinate is a fantastic transition from the iPhone to Android. The interface is similar, but allows for so much more customization and it's super easy to use. My husband is quite technology illiterate and he was picking up the tricks of this interface faster than I was. He loves the phone.. Key features that I love:. As I said, the interface is great. The customization that it offers is face superior to IOS, and while I know I can get this same interface on other droid phones, the design of this phone is what really sold it for me. (Well, that and the buy one get one free offer, to be honest) The phone is very light-weight, and overall a fantastic size. Even with a pretty big case on it, it easily fits into my jeans pockets (not an easy feat if you've seen womens' pants lately). The screen is downright beautiful and large for the phone size. And the camera, both still and video, is great.. Some cons:. The biggest issue for me is the buttons on the bottom of the phone (menu, home, back and search). Even when you're actively using the phone, the backlight shuts off immediately, and since there are no raised indicators for the buttons, it's virtually impossible to find them right away in low light. It always takes me 2 or 3 hits to get the right button. They should remain lit while the phone is actively being used, or at the very least stay on for a full minute after they've been interacted with. Another issue I have is with the power button. It's probably the most-used button on the phone, you power the phone on/off with it and you lock/unlock the phone with it. But it's positioned directly on the opposite side of the phone as the volume toggle. So if you're operating the phone one-handed, you end up messing with the volume instead or fumbling awkwardly so that you don't hit the volume button. The case I got seems to have helped with this, but I still think it's quite an oversight on the product design side. The last issue I have is with the phone itself. When I'm talking I can hear my voice vibrating the internal parts of the phone which essentially creates a tinny echo when I'm talking. It may just be me, I can be a bit of a loud talker, but I have tested it on 3 different Fascinates and had the same problem on all of them. Slightly annoying, but I'm getting use to it.. Now to address the Bing complaints. Yes the entire reason most people get Android phones is for Google. That's why I got mine, and yes it is pretty irksome that Verizon went and preloaded it with Bing. But to come on here and crash the product's rating because of that is just ridiculous and immature. Five minutes of googling and taking an additional 5 minutes to follow a step-by-step tutorial and you can completely reconfigure the phone to default to all Google apps. Super simple and really a complete non-issue. I had my previously stated technology illiterate husband follow the tutorial and he figured it out just fine in under 10 minutes. And it should be noted that the upgrade to Android 2.2 will bring the choice to set your default search engine, problem solved again.. Overall I think this is a fantastic phone, and Verizon's network has proven to be the absolutely best way to go in my area (SF Bay Area). My service is great and my 3G speeds are way faster than they were on AT&#38;T. Android is a great OS and I don't see myself moving to something else anytime in the near future. I also think this is a great phone for those who are just coming into the smartphone world. It's easy to use and fun to customize. All in all, I don't think you can go wrong with this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is so clear and bright compared to the Blackberry I had. Love it. 
Cons:. So far nothing. Learning curve which is obvious in any new device.. 
Summary:. Bright, Clear, and everything you need in front screens. Touch screen is very similar to the iTouch I have also. So that was easy to jump right in. Setup all my appointments. Love the contacts Like I mentions, compared to the Blackberry which I loved, this has it all over the BB. Very nice phone. Would definately recommend to friends and family.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing screen. First time Android user and it's very simple. Very fast compared to my Blackberry. Easy to set up gmail accounts. Easy to customize. Comes with a 16 gb card. Great phone!. 
Cons:. GPS navigation and location can be unreliable, but worked well the few times I actually needed it. Email (not gmail) seems to have some kind of issue. Once you read your email in Outlook it removes it from the phone. Can't sort contacts by last name?. 
Summary:. After becoming very comfortable with my Blackberry's messaging and email capabilities I made a quick transition to the the Fascinate. Although, in my opinion it is not up to par as far as messaging and email go. But the other features of the phone make up for this. Super fast and graphics are amazing. Bing is not an issue unless you only rely on the quick search button, which I haven't used once and actually wish it wasn't even there. You can download all the Google apps easily and use them instead of VZ Navigator (which is the worst navigation system ever) and Bing. Since I am not a Bing hater I use both Bing and Google.. Call quality has been great, not dropped calls. Phone is very easy to navigate and change settings. Endless apps to download.. Overall, I like this phone is a winner. If I was going to use this phone strictly for business I don't think the email setup would be convenient. Since I don't rely on the email, I'm willing to deal with it because of the endless features this phone has.. Several iphone users have commented that they love my phone and its software (I never had an iphone), but seems to be the closest you will get on Verizon.. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is amazing. The Touch-Screen keyboard is very accurate for texting. The phone is very fast and pretty easy to use, even for a technically challenged individual such as myself. The camera is awesome as well.. 
Cons:. I don't like that I have to pay for VZ Nav, I got very used to that application with my last phone and was hoping it would be a free app. Battery life isn't great, but welcome to smart phones.. 
Summary:. The phone looks great, and is very lighweight. I am relatively new to smart phones, and I haven't even looked at the tips &#38; tricks book yet. The software is pretty self-explanitory.. People should reserve their reviews for phones that they have actually used. The Bing vs. Google thing is such a non-issue to me. Bing actually isn't a bad search engine for my needs, and if I want Google or Yahoo, I can simply make it my default browser page. Problem Solved. I think its a great phone, and something to finally shut rival the I-Phone.. So far , so good!. 

$$;
Pros:. It has an awesomely bright screen. High def video. So many widgets and apps It borders on ridiculousness. Pretty easy to use. 
Cons:. Drains battery like crazy. Virtual keyboard can be a bit inaccurate. Default is bing but you can remove it and replace it with a bookmarked google page so its not really a problem. A bit big for the average pocket. 
Summary:. This is a very good phone mainly due to the ease of use and awesome display. If you just can't stand Bing(which is completely illogical its a search engine same as google) then don't get this phone. Bottom line is, it's an all around good phone that is indeed better than a blackberry. 

$$;
Pros:. Display is awesome. Extremely intuitive. Swype. Light. Fast. Sleek. 
Cons:. Bing? Really? I have had Blackberrys, HTC Tytn, Incredible, etc...maybe used search 10 times in 8 years. This is not a deal breaker.... Occasionally slows while downloading from Android Marketplace. 
Summary:. This is actually my wife's phone...I have an Incredible. This is by far and away the "sexiest" of the Androids. The display and animation is amazing...the phone is really even more intuitive than my Incredible. If you have a Droid X, iPhone, Incredible, Evo, etc you have a great phone, stop slagging this phone because it's not what you own!! All PDAs have quirky software from time to time. 2.1 vs 2.2 is really not that noticeable for 80% of the prospective users...Verizon will update when they have the OS that is reliable enough for this phone. If someone had showed you this phone 5 years ago you would have been stunned...it makes me wonder what the heck is in the pipeline right now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen, blazing fast processor, sleek package.. 
Cons:. Yes, bing IS locked in as the "main" search engine however even before 2.2 comes out, you can still search just as easily with google. Also, it does come pre-programmed with a few too many annoying "buy-me-now" apps that cannot be removed.. 
Summary:. Ok, so first I want to say that so many people right off the bat are calling this phone trash because of the bing issue. This should NOT throw you off. I was concerned at first because the look of bing on IE is too cluttered for me however bing is practically IDENTICAL to google as far as phone search engines are concerned. Plus again, it's going to be a non-issue with Android 2.2. Second, I wonder if all those people would be as pissed if it was google locking in their search engine instead. Some of them are just pissed their google didn't get the Big Red nod. I should know; I still remember the good ol' Netscape vs. IE debate with Windows. People like a scandle, even if the two options are the same!. But back to the phone, since that's what you're here for. Here's how I break it down among Verizon's top 3 droid phones sans keyboard. Really, they are all ALMOST identical especially if you are upgrading from a non-droid, non-smart phone. For you nit-pickers: If you like a bigger screen that may not be as pretty, and the best camera, go with a Droid X. If you want a phone thats sexy with a fantastic screen, get a Fascinate. If you can't get past the bing issue, or want something between the two, go with the Incredible. I opt'ed for the Fascinate though I know people with all three and I doubt you'd be dissapointed with any of em!. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the screen, easy to use apps, the slim design.. 
Cons:. Battery life but from what I understand this is common with Android phones.. 
Summary:. This is my first android phone. My husband had one and initially I was looking at the Droid X. I didn't want to wait for that to come in and honestly wasnt too thrilled with the bulky design. The sales person showed me the Fascinate on the website and I fell in love with it. I made a shortcut to google.com on my homepage and that solved the search engine issue since I am not a fan of Bing. My husband likes the phone so much we are going to upgrade his Droid to the Fascinate next week.. 

$$;
Pros:. SuperAMOLED screen looks nothing short of amazing; good screen real estate makes up for lack of physical keyboard; responsive; better than expected battery life. 
Cons:. Software does stutter every now and then, nothing major though; did not ship with 2.2, but "promised" it will arrive by end of year; takes some getting used to for previous android users; GPS not always reliable (no biggie); background tasks.... 
Summary:. First: to those rating this with 1 star simply because it's "locked" to using Bing, news flash: it's a Verzion thing. All Verizon phones are subject to this agreement (though, not all of them have gone to this extent). Quit acting like it's the end of the world. Make a shortcut for google.com, or default your browser's home page to it if Bing is so unusable for you. You're rating the device, not Verizon's business decisions.. At any rate.... The screen is absolutely phenominal. I have difficulty taking my eyes away from it. Words simply do not do it justice. This is one you have to see to believe (in fact, find someone that has it loaded up with a hi-def or good quality video and prepare to be blown away).. I'm normally not a fan of phones without buttons. I'm not a big fan of touch screens. I need a keyboard. That being said, the screen is so massive compared to, say, my previous 'droid (Devour), making it very workable. The screen is responsive, and typing or texting is pretty smooth.. The interface does take some getting used to if you've owned an earlier Android phone. That being said, it's not rocket science. I could personally do without some of the widgets, but it's easy enough to not use them.. Haven't had a chance to really put the camera to use yet, but as with GPS, I really don't care. It's somewhat of a novelty, and it's nice to have. But if I'm looking to take some photos or shoot video, I've got a camera for that. Having said that, I'm sure it's great for quick point-and-shoot moments.. GPS isn't the best at times, but I've got Magellan for that. Not a biggie personally. Only really use it on the phone when looking to see what's near for a bite to eat or to waste time.. Disappointed it did not ship with 2.2 installed, but given the Android update track record, it's going to be a while before we see all phones ship with any new standard. Samsung promises the update by the year's end, and 2.1 definitely beats 1.6.. Call quality is solid, no dropped calls. I've yet to find a way to death-grip this one (by the way, if you have a Devour, wrap your bear paw around the bottom half, covering both sides and the speaker to kill the signal). Battery didn't completely drain after a day of some solid use (calling, txting, downloading and playing with apps), so it beat my expectation. As per all Android phones, make sure to grab a task killer app (really wish they'd make it standard, or find a way around this). If the battery life watching videos were a bit longer, I'd feel comfortable leaving the ZuneHD at home. At least it gets in a full movie and then some, so I'll forgive that (plus, that whole "phone" thing is nice to have).. All in all, I'm happy with it. The screen makes looking at almost anything enjoyable (or in some cases, tolerable with the volume off). Despite the lack of a physical keyboard (knew this before buying), typing is comfortable and responsive. The droid 2.1 software is not as smooth as 2.2, and I really wish it shipped with it, but the update is coming. Sure, default search isn't Google, but it's not that difficult to set the browser's home page to that (pretty much did that first thing). Once you figure out the TouchWiz interface, it's pretty smooth, though I do miss Motorola's MotoBlur (hey, I liked it). All in all, if you're looking for a new Android phone, and what to get those iSheep second guessing their new contracts (or in my case, Verizon is the only game in town), this is an excellent device and is definitely worth taking a look at.. 

$$;
Pros:. Voice turn by turn navigation (key for a salesperson with no sense of direction...me), great Google apps, easy to use User Interface, good battery life, but.... 
Cons:. POP email doesn't sync...huge problem....read the message boards and forums.. 
Summary:. I love this phone, but I really got it for two reasons: Internet browsing and work email. The work email (POP) doesn't sync regularly, forcing me to check manually. Then you're just a paranoid sales guy checking his phone every five minutes for the big email. That may not sounds like a big deal, but if you've had a blackberry then you've grown accustomed to a trustworthy email device. The fascinate also seems to tease me by showing messages in my inbox, then they disappear. I downloaded the K-9 mail app, but message just sit in the outbox. K-9 is also a space hog.. I'm not a tech geek. Just a guy who knows how to navigate and is computer literate. i wasn't expecting this problem. Three weeks to go before my 30 days is up.. 

$$;
Pros:. amoled screen fast swipe touchwiz sleek looks good features and the bottons. 
Cons:. confusing place for the power button no real keyboard locked into bing for search. 
Summary:. the galaxy s is great phone but not for me i like having a real keyboard and they need to get rid of being locked into bing for search it would be home run phone for verizion and samsung. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen is beautiful. Fun applications, seems to have a lot to offer.. 
Cons:. Every call made on this phone has an echo in the ear. As you speak, you can hear yourself in the earpeice. Highly annoying and not fixable. Went through two brand new devices in 2 days trying to resolve this issue.. 
Summary:. The bottom line with this phone is that although having a "fun" and high end phone is nice, the basic reason we have a phone is to make calls! If you can't make a call without hearing yourself echo (no matter where you are so its not just a service issue) then time to move on to another phone as sad as it is to let the fascinate go!. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim and fast. Browser is good, internet connection is quick when working properly. great app selection! Yes I have Google search!! Kool live wallpapers, gr8 swype feature! Don't fall for blackberry's phones, they are horrible! 8 storms in 2 years!!. 
Cons:. Needs more RAM! 3G doesn't always work even with full signal?!?! You need to download a memory booster widget to keep freeing up RAM or the phone gets sluggish. Battery life can go quickly if using alot of active apps. had to use help site alot?!. 
Summary:. As I said, much better than the 8 storms i had! still not perfect. hopefully they have a fix that will monitor and free up memory constanly or have an upgrade to use sd card for ram?? 325megs of ram is too small! Videos and pics are great! works very similar to an iphone. this is thin, light and easy to operate. better buy a silicone sleeve, cuz this is very slippery and hard to hold onto, could use an anti slip back like some of the Droid phones have?? If you don't mind waiting 3 days, order online from verizon and that way you don't have to wait for the wonderful rebate visa card!!!!! I do have to replace this phone already, have had it for about 3 weeks and screen won't stay on when I am trying to check my voicemail, and i have had several other glitches that i believe are verizon issues not the phone. Speaker is ok unless you set the phone down, then it gets muffled, especially if you have a silicone sleeve on the phone and if you have it in a leather holster foret about feeling the vibration and you better have a quiet room or you will not hear the ringer, no matter what ringer you have! All in all I would give this phone a 31/2 star rating?!?!. 

$$;
Pros:. display quality, ease of use. 
Cons:. no button on bottom of screen to unlock/wake up the phone. 
Summary:. I activated the phone a few days after getting an HTC Droid Incredible just to see the differences. I will start by saying I really really like the droid incredible! But my previous phone was a Samsung Rogue. The display quality on a samsung product is unmatched by other brands! This whole Bing thing was solved by removing everything that I could that said bing and adding google maps. I just put a shortcut to voice search (which is google) on my homepage and now I can use my phone to voice navigate with google maps! Also does google internet searches. That was a very easy fix, so if this whole bing thing makes you not want the phone do not worry about it! there are ways around it!. The phone operates fast. Just like the incredible. I have had a few instances on the fascinate where it has errors when I am on the web or using facebook. It was mostly when I was setting up the phone. But it has been a little annoying. The call quality is great. swype is amazing! I did download slide it on my incredible, which is very similar to swype. I do like that on the incredible it will put a 1, 2, 3 etc on your message shortcut when you have new messages, which I really like. Both phones can last a whole day on a full charge, but I do not play a lot of games and I use advanced task killer to shut things down when I am not using them.. all in all I will have trouble deciding which phone I am going to keep and which phone I am going to get rid of!. I will say you will be happy with either device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing Screen, slim design, excellent quality photos &#38; video. 
Cons:. Software is buggy, only plays well with gmail, GPS issues.. 
Summary:. First of all I have to say I have used this phone for a full 4 weeks, I'm on my 2nd unit in fact and that one is being returned today. I could care less about the BING issue, or that the GPS can't really lock in on my location and says that right now I'm in the middle of the East River (about a mile off.) But being that I expect my phone's features to actually work, I had my gripes with the Fascinate:. -The first unit would not send any text messages to a specific person on my contact list, after hours with tech support we figured out that it works if I typed her phone number by hand, every time. That problem was solved with the new unit, although I still question if everyone is getting my txts.. -Sometimes when I go to slide the "puzzle" to answer a call it simply would not move like the screen's sensor was not responding, and I can't answer the call. This happened a few times on both units. Probably the #1 reason why I'm returning the phone.. -I understand that this is a google phone, but I don't think I should have to be forced to use gmail. After a few days of the phone syncing my MSN mail just fine, it simply stopped downloading any new email. I was told by tech support this is a "known issue" with ANY email account other than gmail.. -Speaking of sync issues, both the feed and the buddies screens (which I LOVE) simply don't update on time and are hours if not days behind real time updates. When the buddies screen does finally sync with let's say Facebook, and grabs a friend's latest profile photo, it's a very low-res pixelated version of the online photo. For a phone with such an absolutely amazing screen, I prefer/expect to see clean clear photos (like the ones in the ads!) But maybe I'm just picky.. -No dedicated camera button, and calendar alert tone can't be controlled. I agree with previous reviewers, both issues are a nuisance.. -The screen sometimes goes dim for no good reason.. Bottom line is I'm going to miss a lot of things about this excellent phone, the beautiful big screen, swipe texting which took some getting used to, the ability to customize screens, the fast camera, awesome sound and video quality. But I just can't get over the features that just don't deliver..

Pros:. incredible hardware. 
Cons:. software needs help! see below for details .... 
Summary:. The hardware is spectacular. As for software, I'm not referring to Verizon's blunders adding bloatware or locking to Bing. That's been beaten already. The issues I see are more about user interface for core functionality.... My previous device was the Droid Eris. I thought I was upgrading by moving to this newer device, but there are some things that frustrate me. I've called Verizon support, and they have confirmed that these things are not available on the phone:. 1. The email and messaging icons don't display the number of unread messages in the icon on the desktop. Yes, I know you can look in the notification bar, but this seems so obvious to me, I don't know how it was missed.. 2. The Samsung widgets in general are limited.. 3. The contacts are ONLY stored by first name first, last name last. The older Eris allowed users to specify how to file a contact. In the days of the old fashioned paper phone book, how many people filed information by people's first names?! Come on.. 4. The phone dialer pad isn't as functional as the Eris. If I started typing "764" then I would see results of contacts that included those numbers as well as results that included "SMI" (as if I were beginning the last name "Smith".. 5. I'm not a fan of swype ... which is no big deal, but the predictive text is not nearly as good as what I had before. First, it takes up a lot of room on the screen. Second, it only adds each word to the document after you've finished it. The android keyboard does this better, but it doesn't handle numbers and symbols very well, so you can't get the best of both worlds. I hate to say it, but here again the HTC wins.. 6. I haven't figured out exactly what notifications show up on the lock screen (like missed calls), but it would be really nice if they did this for # of new voicemails, # of unread emails, and # of unread txt msgs. It would be great that you don't even have to enter the phone to be able to see if you have any new things to deal with.. If someone in Samsung wants to contact me for more feedback, I'd be happy to help improve on it. Since these are all software related, the good news is, they can all be addressed. I'll be interested to see if I get any reply. Note, apps on some of this are not applicable or very limited, because most of the other phones address these issues well in the software provided on the phone.. Hope this helps!. 

$$;
Pros:. The best part of the phone is the most obvious and that is the screen. What is displayed on the screen is gorgeous.. 
Cons:. Verizon blocking the ability to have video out via a cable. No way to delete the Verizon pre loaded programs. Inconsistent syncing of e-mail. No syncing with Outlook out of the box.. 
Summary:. I have had this phone for a week now. I got it to replace the blackberry storm so by comparison to that phone this one is light years ahead. While the phone has the expected android software and typical smartphone features, Verizon has found a way to nickel and dime you to spend more and more money on their services. It is unfathomable while any smartphone can not sync to outlook out of the box. My old blackberry had the blackberry desktop that allowed you to sync why can't this phone? The phone isn't even recognized by my Macbook. Another problem is syncing with my home e-mail account it works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. I have taken it back to Verizon three times and the company response was it was a Verizon network problem (hard to believe since the internet worked on it and so did SMS and the phone. I hope that the new Android software will solve some of these problems but Verizon may block some of the abilities in that software too.. 

$$;
Pros:. I am coming from the Droid Eris and am a fan of Droid. Some of the features that are on this phone is great and I love the phone for other things. 
Cons:. I just purchased a Samsung Fascinate on Thursday. I am already on my third phone. The first phone I could not download any apps from the market, the second I downloaded 2 apps and then no more.. 
Summary:. The third phone I believe that I have been able to download 6 apps and now I get download unsuccessful. I have hard reset the phone, formatted the sd card. I love the phone so would love any suggestions and would like if anyone else is having this problem to reply. I want to keep the phone but am frustrated about the issue that I am having. Can anyone help.. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone is OK - it does most of what I expect. 
Cons:. I have &gt;800 business contacts in my Outlook address book. The Fascinate imported and alphebetized by first name. Verizon tells me it is not possible to sort contacts by last name, despite the phone knows which is first &#38; which is the last name.. 
Summary:. First-name alphebetization is a major defect. I don't think of my clients as 'Bill' or 'Paul' which makes it very difficult to locate the person I want to call.. Being restricted to Bing is another major defect. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the phone, interface is great, very user friendly. 
Cons:. battery life is pathetic and does NOT work for corporate e-mail. I have called Verizon, they agreed, I am returning it and waiting for google to fix this- may try an IPhone instead. 
Summary:. If you do not have corporate e-mail it is great- if you do have it and your company uses EAS-forget it. 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous multimedia capabilities. I used the Samsung Captivate for 30 days. Would be fantastic after a root.. 
Cons:. 1. If its more Vibrant than Captivate, it would feel very plasticky.. 2. YOU ARE FORCED TO USE BING !!! No, you can not switch to Google or Yahoo!!. 3. Verizon has made the phone default to VZ navigator on every opportunity presented for navigation.. 
Summary:. This is more of a comment. I havent handles this particular device. If it is out of place, Mods, feel free to remove my testament.. 

$$;
Pros:. screen, screen, screen. 
Cons:. some but not all messages received from my POP account. The speaker, incoming calls varied in volume. Some were great, others were so loud they were garbled. Bluetooth functionality. Dates did not sync with google calendar.. 
Summary:. I had this phone 4 weeks and wanted to make it work, returning one unit, hoping a second would be better. I tried numerous "fixes" from forums but nothing worked.. Bluetooth voice prompts varied from good, to very low, to freezing with a visual prompt instead of audible. Speaker volume varied as well making some in coming calls garbled. I could not live with receiving only 2/3 of my emails.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen, good battery, very responsive and fast, good camera. 
Cons:. Locked to Bing search, which is awful on this device. GPS is worthless. Old version of Android that should've been updated months ago. Verizon-added bloatware that you can't uninstall. Scary reception issues.. 
Summary:. This has the potential to be the best Android, and best Verizon phone ever. It is fast, has an amazing display, and the battery life is very good for a screen this big. But there are some flaws that really bring this thing down. First, and most absurd, is that you are locked into Bing search. The Bing search app on this phone is very slow, and has poor results compared to Google on other Android devices. Beyond the fact it seems absurd to have a Google device without Google search, my real issue is that the Bing app is just no good here. Also, GPS is a known issue with this phone. It takes forever to find your location, and frequently never will. It is also frustrating that this still uses Android 2.1 when 2.2 has been out so long. The 2.2 update is supposed to fix a lot of the bugs on the phone, and the Bing issue, and let's hope it does. What it won't fix is all the Verizon bloatware. This is my fourth Verizon Android smartphone this year and every one of them comes loaded with bad Apps that you cannot remove. Many will also startup on their own, and even with an app killer, will restart automatically - unnecessarily decreasing battery life. I think it is unacceptable that despite owning this phone, Verizon won't let me remove Apps that I don't want or need. Perhaps that is why everyone 'roots' the Android phones.. Lastly, I have had some scary reception issues and dropped calls with this phone that I have never had with other Verizon phones. But that hasn't been a real deal breaker, especially compared to my experience with the iPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen. Responsive interface.. 
Cons:. Call quality not that great but the biggest thing is the GPS is horrible. IF the unit could actually find a satellite, the readings were literally thousands of feet off which basically renders the GPS functions useless.. 
Summary:. I work with media and this phone seems to do a nice job with that but compared to my Wife's HTC Incredible, the call quality is not as good. The GPS is just about useless because it can't pick up signals. Compared to a friends Incredible in the same wooden-roof building, my Fascinate couldn't find a signal where as his Incredible was pinpointed his position to the wall and window by which he was sitting. My iPod Touch was able to get better readings. Reluctantly, I'm probably going to take this back and get an Incredible. I really wanted to like this phone and it saddens me to have to exchange.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice design. flesh cam.. 
Cons:. No Google, No Video chat, bad GPS, expensive service from Verizon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Yes - this phone looks great! easy to use and the size is perfect. I was very excited to purchse this phone and charged the battery fully when receiving this phone.. 
Cons:. I used this phone for one full day and when i woke up the following morning the phone was fried. An Andriod update was showing on my screen saying that it was malfunctioning and basically you need technical service or a replacement phone.... 
Summary:. On my trip back to verizon they were kind enough to let me return this phone becuase i was not comfortable owning a phone that couldnt last more than a day...and i am anxiously awaiting my DRIOD X to come in the mail as my friends never had any problems with this phone...The Samsung is a newer phone and i am not comfortable that they have all the kinks out of it and i am not one to test it out on their behalf after spending all this money on it... I am not a review writer but i feel i need to let people know of the situation i encountered.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great looking phone, excellent screen, high resolution. 
Cons:. Disjointed: Bing for search, some parts are Google and who knows what else...Sheesh! What were they thinking?. 
Summary:. What's next Bing for Search, Yahoo for IM, and Google for Maps? Maybe WP7 will come preloaded with Google and they will break functionality with the Live ecosystem. You pay a price premium for Verizon, you hope they don't mess with things just for a few bucks more.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light weight, great screen, running android, good sound quality. 
Cons:. Plastic back scratches easily, has bing hard coded as search with no option. They stripped the TV out option and all you have is the DNLA which is a joke and I did confirm this with both Samsung and Verizon. Mine is going back.. 
Summary:. The Fascinate DOES NOT HAVE VIDEO OUT. I just confirmed it with them and they are calling the DNLA garbage video out which it is just streaming and is not video out. Finally I thought a phone worth buying and it is just another piece of stripped down garbage from the likes of Verizon. We need to boycott them until they understand it is about us and not their greedy stock holders and stupid decisions!!!!. Updated. on Sep 11, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Screen. 2. CPU/GPU. 3. Thin. 4. Light. 
Cons:. 1. BING only search--can NOT switch to google. All voice searches including maps and directions can only go through bing.. 2. VZ Navigator default--must download Googgle Maps and reset all defaults.. 3. GPS like on all Galaxy S phones is sub-par.. 
Summary:. Great gardware marred by a sub par GPS and Verizon's greed. Don't worry about Touch Wiz if you do not like it. It can be replaced with an advanced version of the stock interface by installing Launcher Pro or ADW Launcher.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super AMOLED screen blows the other displays away. 1GHz Hummingbird processor best to date.. 
Cons:. Bing is FORCED on an Android phone - totally unacceptable. What a rape.. 
Summary:. When you deny standard Google services out of the box, by definition you no longer have Android.. This forcing of Bing on this Android phone is a desperate, cowardly move by Microsoft, since they know their Windows Mobile/Windows Phone ecosystem is total crap. It also smacks of antitrust, and I smell a class action lawsuit and/or punitive actions coming from DOJ/FTC. They're doing an "Internet Explorer" all over again. Microsoft, put Bing all to your heart's content on your junk phones, but LEAVE ANDROID ALONE! Google, get some BALLS and set up some basic standard parameters and definitions of what Android shall be and shall not be, for the licensing agreement.. Unfortunately, Microsoft signed a five-year agreement with Verizon to put Bing as the default/only search engine on all future devices. That kind of forced exclusivity should be deemed as anti-competitive and illegal.. What Google should have done from the start, even before the T-Mobile G1, is to make one really killer phone, like the Nexus One on steroids, but instead of the mistakes they made, open up physical stands in shopping malls (not as expensive as building brick-and-mortar stores, especially for one product), and sell their phone separately, unsubsidized...but offer interest-free financing for two years. That way they'd have control over their phones and OS, not the carriers. No bloatware or forced "skins" on the OS. Actually, let me qualify what I said. I'd still advocate for open source, but the USER should have control, not Google, and not the carriers. The carriers should just carry the signal, period. Google makes a basic Android OS with certain key functionality and tie-in to Google services, but the user can download or sideload any software, skins, etc., he or she wants. That's the best of both worlds; that's how it should be.. 

$$;
Pros:. The processor is fast and the apps are great. Love the look too.. 
Cons:. Call quality is hideous. Calls to landlines sound like i'm screaming into a speaker phone.. Has an awful echo.. Bing search is worthless.. VZW customer service is horrendous.. 
Summary:. I've been a loyal Verizon customer for 7 years. Last year, I picked up a Droid and fell in love with the Android OS. However, I started to become frustrated with the high cost of the Verizon Wireless service. When my new every two contract came up this year, I decided to look at other services for the first time in 7 years. While demoing the T-Mobile service, I received a Samsung Vibrant as my demo phone. I fell in love with the Galaxy S platform and the amazing AMOLED screen. However, I found T-Mobile's service to be horrendous so I decided to stick with Verizon. Since Verizon just released the Samsung Fascinate, I decided to go with that phone based on my experience with the Samsung Vibrant. Wow...what a mistake that was.. I don't know what Verizon has done to this phone, but the call quality is absolutely abysmal. I've called landlines in perfect 3G coverage areas and was told that I sound like I'm screaming into a speaker phone. I've made calls in lower coverage areas with the T-Mobile phone, and found the call quality to be much better.. Now, on top of the poor call quality, i hear myself in the speaker of the phone. It sounds like I'm screaming at myself. It's horribly distorted and just sounds hideous. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH THE SAMSUNG VIBRANT which is essentially THE SAME PHONE.. Now onto the Bing Search shenanigans...just like everyone else, I thought this was strange. However, it was definitely not a deal breaker. I use Bing at work and have never really had any problems with it. However, being a prior Droid user, i was used to being able to click Voice Search and say "Navigate to..." and it would pull up the Google maps app and send me on my way. However, with the Bing search, if I click on voice search, say "navigate to...", and then click the Done button (what a pain that is) it brings me to a screen where it says "did you mean...?" and not the Bing maps. This effectively cripples the functionality of the phone. For me to navigate with my phone now, I have to open the Google (or Bing) maps app, click on the functions key, choose directions, click on the To: bar, click on voice search and then finally enter my destination.. Next up is the bloat ware that Verizon shoved on this phone. There's some kind of advanced caller ID feature which brings up the location of the person that you are calling...or is calling you. I thought this was kind of a cool feature that Samsung or Verizon must have added to the Fascinate. That is until about 6 hours after activating the phone, a pop-up screen shows up saying, "City ID displays the city &#38; state of an incoming call. You are receiving a free 15-day trial of this Enhanced Caller ID feature. Would you like City ID for $1.99 per month?" Then there are two buttons...Subscribe Now or Continue Free Trial.... What...am I on the WWWyzzerrdd episode of ATHF? I didn't sign up for any trial...where's the stop trial button? Where's the uninstall app button? Is this even legal???!!!. Now...all of this would be bad enough, but I went into the Verizon store tonight to find out if I was doing something wrong, only to be told that I was crazy. The call sounded perfect........WHOA ***??!! This is how you treat a 7 year customer that was already on the fence with your service???. Bottom line...if you're going Verizon, stick with the Droid X or Droid Incredible.. 

$$;
Pros:. Locked to Bing.. 
Cons:. Some people may not care that much, but being locked onto bing is a deal breaker for me. Someone might come up with a hack, but why bother when Verizon has so many other great Android phones. Shame, this could have been a good one.. 
Summary:. Too many other great phones to put up with stupid hamstringing of a capable device.. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is crystal clear and easily viewable in direct sunlight. Email accounts can be combined.. 
Cons:. First the group feature does not work at all even though the groups are established in gmail. Also the contacts are sorted in last name alphabetical order but if you have a pre fix such as Mr. those contacts will be sorted as M.. 
Summary:. Compounding this issue Verizon store technical support tells me this is a hybrid operating system that is not fully android. The default web browser is Bing and you can not change it. The phone doesn't inculde google maps as an installed application either.. On the group syncing issue you actually can't even work around it because if you manually re create the group on the phone and try to add a contact the only contacts that are available are the "not assigned" contacts which I think come from the Verizon automatic back up. Looks like if you want to use this as a business phone and you have a lot of contacts you need the HTC or Motorola phone. I just got off the phone with Samsung technical support and they advised me they don't intend to fix this problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best Screen on the market! Easy to use interface. That is about it.. 
Cons:. Bing search is default and you can't change it. If you can change the search engine to Google that would be OK but you can't! Verizon is charging you 9.99 monthly for VZ Nav which pales in comparison to google maps (You have to download it).. 
Summary:. The phone has an amazing screen and beautiful color. But there is no way I am buying a google phone without all of the google software. Comon Verizon and Samsung you guys really messed this up.. 

$$;
Pros:. Processor, display, (Verizon) skin build quality. 
Cons:. Defective Galaxy S GPS components. 
Summary:. Samsung shipped Galaxy S units for US carriers in the face of existing reports of defective GPS functionality from owners in Europe and Asia. Too bad Verizon didn't apply sufficient due diligence with Samsung Electronics (along with TMobile, ATT , etc).. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen is amazing,. 
Cons:. Bing- This should not have happened . Bing is sub par and was only developed to make money it is inferior to google in all aspects. VZ-navigator is a 9.99 joke this phone should have google nav standard.. 
Summary:. Really erked at verizon for this one. but hey iphone in january. 

$$;
Pros:. Great display with a great sleek look.. 
Cons:. No Google Search!. Not as easy to use as my sister's Nexus One. Software seems different. I dont like it.. 
Summary:. I was so excited to have my phone, but regret buying it! I will be selling it on Ebay.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super amoled screen. 
Cons:. 1. Bing is default search, NO choice as to changing it. The search is awful!. 2. Google navigation disabled.. 3. GPS does not work.. 4. Phone is laggy.. 5. Poor software support from Samsung. 
Summary:. Don't buy it. Get a Droid instead.. 

$$;
Pros:. Samsung humming bird processor ... camera flash as compared with other devices .... 
Cons:. 1) No google search engine ... default is bing and cannot be changed .. (no google search on android phone .. how stupid). 2) Verizon navigation is default navigation ... i feel comfortable with google navigation system .... 3) buggy software. 
Summary:. Updated. on Sep 7, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Fooled by the screen. Touch Wiz by Google was a intersting idea by Google to better maniuplate the Droid OS.. 
Cons:. Had two of these phones. Completely Worthless. Speaker Buzz at the upper speaker. Google: "Fascinate Call Quality" and check the Android Forums for same issues. I am dealing tieh Tech Support. You have two Returns. M1 (At Store) and M2 (Tech Support). 
Summary:. DO not buy this phone. It is really not worth anything even if it was free.... 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing is good on it. 
Cons:. Everything. Some time it works sometimes it freezes sometimes the internet doesn't work. 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous screen, the phone is very thin and light with nice ergonomics, very comfortable to hold, feels good in the hand. Fast processor and lots of memory. The camera (both still and video) take excellent photos.. 
Cons:. One word: Verizon. Being only pre-configured with Bing would have been little more than a minor inconvenience not even worth mention. But they actually programmed the OS to *disallow* the Google search engine from being added to the home screen.. 
Summary:. To fully De-Bing this phone, a user has to replace the launcher AND web browser, loosing functionality that they paid for in the process. 3rd party launchers have no access to the included library of Samsung widgets, some of which are actually quite nice. Likewise, 3rd party browsers lack some handy features of the stock browser such as the ability to re-flow text depending on zoom level.. Moving past Bing, Verizon saw fit to install more than a half dozen demos, trials and apps which nag the user to either purchase the full versions or sign up for subscriptions ranging from $3 to $10 a month. None of these apps can be disabled or uninstalled, so forever take up storage space and, for the apps running a service, consume processor cycles and therefore battery life.. Wrapping up the delightfully dreadful user experience are numerous software bugs that prevent the GPS from acquiring a position fix in under 10 minutes (if ever), an over driven earpiece causing distortion/crackling, weak sound and various other sporadic issues.. Bottom line, instead of ensuring the phone worked properly, Verizon dedicated their time and resources to maximizing the revenue they could generate from this phone through pre-installation deals with other corporations, even when that came at the expense of user experience and choice.. With this phone, Verizon treats their customers as little more than livestock to make a buck off of while feeding them garbage.. The biggest shame is that Samsung did a great job on the hardware, but Verizon's obsession with loading it down with nag-ware give the phone all the charm of an intrusive, panhandling bum.. Avoid.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android, Awesome screen.. 
Cons:. The biggest selling point for an Android phone is it's integration with google services(Search, Map, Voice Search, Navigation etc.) and if you don't have all of them on an Android phone, in that case there is no point buying one.. 
Summary:. In fact locked to bing is a shame, I don't have issues with a default choice of Bing but user should have an option to change to Google, locking the phone to Bing is totally unacceptable.. Totally agitated and disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Samsung Galaxy is available with all carriers.. 
Cons:. Verizon, Verizon, Verizon. 
Summary:. Verizon may have the best network but they abuse their status. I've been burned by them too many times, I'll never go back. This is a perfect example, a great product ruined.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen.. 
Cons:. Few customizations, does not suport all features of Android 2.2 (voice dial, bluetooth file transfer).. 
Summary:. Bing lock-in with no Google search is a killer. Opt for Samsung Capitivate, Galaxy or even Dell Streak.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim, ,Screen.. 
Cons:. Sense overlay, Bing lock, Verizon Navigator.. 
Summary:. I'm so tired of big red antics, this Bing lock in is a deal breaker, and if they continue on this path I'll take my family plan to Sprint!. I was planning to migrate my 4 phones to smart phones and eat the extra $120 data plan But I'll wait and see how this plays out. I may get a Virgin MYFI with an I pod touch and use Google phone/IM service for all my calls and texting. If someone designs and makes a skin case to the touch with MYFI it will be a big winner.. 

$$;
Pros:. The hardware is excellent.. 
Cons:. Only Bing. Okay to put it as the default. But need an easy way to change to Google.. 

$$;
Pros:. Loved the feel of the phone. Thin...responsive. The screen is immaculate. Sync-ed easily with Gmail Contacts which I've come to rely upon.. 
Cons:. What is up with DEFAULTING to Bing search engine? AND....you can't change the default??? Not just a red flag...for me it's a deal killer. Isn't the point of an Android to have as much flexibility as possible. THEY BLEW IT.. 
Summary:. Updated. on Sep 7, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Good screen.. 
Cons:. Search is locked by Verizon and Samsung to Bing. I'm not against defaulting to Bing, but it's unacceptable to lock users and not allow them to choose. This is a deal breaker.. 
Summary:. Crossed off the list of potential new phones..
