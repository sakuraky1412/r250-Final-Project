we had a quick 2-day / 1-night stay as a surprise birthday trip in an imperial club room .
it was nicely situated with a view of the arabian gulf with all the luxurious room trimmings one expects ( including a beach bag and flip flops ) .
they brought up a nice birthday cake and card .
other positives - compare the price of the included access to the aquaventure water park and lost chamber aquarium .
we opted for the additional `` behind the scenes '' aquarium tour and it was worth it .
very educational for kids and adults alike .
there are a lot of restaurants with many choices , but expect to pay a pretty penny for any of the proper sit-down restaurants .
it is worth trying out one of the specialty restaurants but sadly some like ossiano ( sp ?
) do not allow children : ) the imperial club check-in helped avoid the long check-in queues and would include an airport transfer ; remember it is a massive resort with a lot of rooms so expect lines everywhere - dinner lines , waits for the elevators , check-in lines and especially while waiting for your car if you are checking out on a saturday afternoon .
after a nice relaxing massage i had to wait 30 minutes for our car which should have taken 10-15 minutes in horrid humidity without any fans .
at one point the valet service said they did n't know where the car was .
they did apologize and promise action . . .
