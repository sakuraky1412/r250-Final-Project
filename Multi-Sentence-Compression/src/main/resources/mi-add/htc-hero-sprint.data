bottom line , phone is very good if you are a social networking person or a business person  .
i would recommend this phone to those kind of people  .
browser is slow and texting in landscape mode with text prediction and auto correction is extremely slow , but great when text prediction and auto correction is turned off  .
the htc hero also has a great camera with a 5mp's and auto    focus but lacking the flash  .
battery life isnt all that great , because cell standby or display takes up alot of the battery  .
i found out that my phone lasts longer on a wifi connection rather then the mobile connection  .
if the browser and battery life got improved this would be the ultimate phone for me .
i have used many of tmo's phones and after finally leaving them for sprint , i am truly satisfied  .
with the android 2  .
1 os , some of tmo's could have really benefited from the newer os .
it is very customizable with its 7 screens , widgets , and folders  .
it is a great value , now only $99  .
the battery life is not that good , but it can be increased by putting the power option widget on the home screen and turning off gps , bluetooth , wifi , and the data off using that widget  .
freeses data , in otherwords wo not connect to the network at times , this is due to having the wifi signal on and in use for about 48 hours or more and causes the phone to not be able to connect to the sprint network , this can be fixed by holding down the power button and selecting airplane mode on , then turning it back on .
found it to be freezing up until i downloaded the free advanced app killer  .
this is by far the best phone i've ever owned .
bottom line is this is the best phone ever  .
i have had mine for a month now  .
i had the instinct before and i hated it  .
i wanted a touch screen and at that time , the instinct is one of the better ones out for sprint  .
i could not text on it which frustrated me to all heck as all i do is text  .
the phone would freeze anyways i could go on and on about how i hated my previous phone  .
so i finally upgraded and it is between the hero and the moment  .
i is worried about having another touch screen for texting that is the only thing that had me torn  .
i fell in love with the hero just from playing around for a few min  .
i have owned it for a month now and have to say i love it  .
texting is so easy i just use the t9 feature and i am good to go  .
the phone is so organized and you can put apps where you like so they are easy access for you  .
i really could go on and on about how great this phone has been  .
i am truly truly happy with my choice  .
anyone worried about texting on this phone take it from me i am a huge text person and i have had no problems  .
i have also ready that the screen stays on while on a call which causes the phone to hang up for push buttons  .
i have not had that problem my phone goes to a black screen during a call  .
if you want a phone that does everything for you and then some and that you can make fun , this is the one for you  .
good luck to all of you in search of a great phone  .
one other thing if you are a facebook user all of your contacts that have facebook their profile pictures will be their contact photo  .
i found that very cool   )  .
works great for me and had it for a month and very happy  .
may get one for my daughter this week updated  .
on mar 19 , 2010  .
glad somebody finally built a smartphone worthy of the title  .
overall , i still love the phone updated  .
on jan 24 , 2010  .
i have used many phones    blackberry curve and palm treo pro for my smartphones  .
this phone is much better than both  .
i is deciding between this phone and the pre  .
the apps for andriod is a huge plus for the hero  .
plus , the pre did not offer a touchscreen keyboard when in landscape mode    very odd  .
i am very satisfied with my choice of phone  .
i am looking forward to andriod 2  .
ve had this phone for about 3 weeks now and i  .
m very impressed  .
s hard picking a new phone , especially when you  .
re the kind of person who doesn  .
t change phones every few months  .
i usually tend to keep my phone for 2    3 years ; hence the importance of making sure that this phone is the right phone  .
i do a lot of research and every phone has cons , the question then is   can you live with the cons of that phone  .
are they really cons for you or only for other people  .
this is my first smart phone or touch screen phone for that matter  .
m very efficient texting using numbers 1    9 , so i is worried that i would lose that efficiency with a touch screen keyboard  .
originally i is only looking at phones with a dedicated slide out keyboard for that reason , but considering how much bigger and bulkier those phones are , i really wanted something portable that would fit in my pocket without creating an uncomfortable dent  .
so i took the plunge and based on some good reviews and lots if in    store testing , bought the htc hero  .
to my surprise , the touch screen keyboard is fairly accurate  .
in addition , you are able to calibrate this keyboard for your fingers  .
there  .
s a wizard that prompts you to type a given sentence containing all alphabetic characters and depending on where you touch (between keys for example) , the keyboard will adjust accordingly , so that however you type , it knows what key you meant to hit  .
this is very useful and works well  .
it also features word completion and it seems like it recommends the words you use most , which i  .
ve noticed after a while and a lot of texting  .
so most of the time i can start a long word with only 3    4 characters and by hitting the space key , it fills in the recommended word  .
it does give you a pop    up list of words as you type , so you can choose any other word or even add your own  .
this saves you a lot of time talking about texting , it sort of presents your incoming and outgoing text messages like gmail does emails  .
it groups them by contact  .
this is very nice because it always keeps any incoming messages , even hours or days later , in context let  .
s talk about the built    in email client  .
i believe you can setup as many accounts as you want  .
i currently have three imap accounts setup  .
the email client allows you to delete multiple messages at once , sort them by date , subject , sender , and size  .
in addition , any one email can be opened , moved , deleted , marked as unread , replied to , replied to all , and forwarded  .
although by default it shows each message in its own line based on most recent date , you can tab over to the right and see them grouped based on conversation  .
just like the text messages mentioned earlier  .
another tab over to the right allows you to see any email attachments you have received  .
in the email settings you can adjust font size (smallest , small , medium , large , and largest) , you can choose to use a signature (just text) , choose where to save attachments (internal/microsd card) , and whether you want to confirm the deletion of an email  .
there are also some send and receive options where you can set the mail size limit , download frequency (manual or every x minute) , how many emails you want to retrieve (number of emails or by days) , whether you want to reply with original text and whether you always want to bcc yourself on any outgoing messages part 1 continued below .
i highly recommend this phone to any person of any age and carrir but it does work wonder on the sprint network and got to love sprint navigation and live tv   )  .
this is probably one of sprint's top 5 phones (perhaps top 3)  .
i have got to use a few of these , moment , tour , and hero in the last 2 months and my personal opinion is that this is the best device of those i started with the moment and my son with the tour  .
in the middle of the month we traded the tour in for the hero  .
the tour is a great phone but it is more business based , less fun after a month a half my son and i switched so he has the moment and i have the hero  .
he likes the moment better specifically for the keyboard  .
(he texts like the teen he is) the battery on the hero is about 60% better than the moment with the same apps running  .
i get through the day with the hero unless i am really doing some internet time  .
i had to really conserve to get through 12    14 hours on the moment cnet put down the rating of the hero after the droid eris from verizon came out but i think this is very wrong  .
they have the same software and interior hardware , except for the proximity sensor  .
this is not worth a 1/2 star  .
the moment has the proximity sensor and although i did like it , some people don't like the blacking out of the screen  .
also i have become very used to waiting the 15    30 seconds that it takes my phone to black out on its own , before tucking it under my ear  .
not a problem also cnet liked the touch keys of the eris even though it took several pushes of the menu button  .
i had this problem with the moments touch keys also , and it would drive me crazy  .
with the hero i know when i touch the menu , or search , etc and never have had response issues  .
when the eris came out my brother asked what i thought he should buy , droid or eris , and i suggested the moto droid because of the updated software and speeder processor  .
the eris has neither of these over the hero  .
and the touch keys are not the way to go i text between 150    300 text a month so i use the onscreen keyboard plenty  .
if you set the key board to compact qwerty , (this is similar to the suretype of blackberry perl) it will only set the keyboard to compact in portrait mode and in landscape it will still give you the normal qwerty keyboard  .
i find this takes care of most of my keyboard issues , which were mostly with the cramped portrait qwerty and hitting the wrong keys  .
the predictive text is really good and in landscape mode , i can punch out a pretty quick paragraph to come out of sleep , you can either push the menu button or the end button  .
i liked this much better than the moment where you always pushed end  .
i did get use to it but it felt like i is going to hang up on someone i finally found a stylus that works for this phone , the dagi stylus  .
i tried several types and this is the only one that worked well  .
i hope that others come out to compete and perhaps improve on design  .
taking gloves of in winter is the biggest reason for wanting a stylus though it is much more precise i probably would have given this phone a 9/10 but i am so mad that cnet brought it down as an after thought  .
the phone itself is really good with voice calls and even the speaker phone is great  .
i will set it down while getting dressed and leave it on speaker phone , i could not do this with my centro (my last treo)  .
i have used both wired headset (blackberry premium stereo) and bluetooth (plantroinics) both worked really well but the bluetooth drains the phone batter about twice as fast as normal  .
the wired headsets were definitely the better quality even with using only one earbud  .
(i won't drive with a headset in both ears) blackberry headsets work and are great , i like the premium in    ear eargel ones listening to music on the phone is really easy and great quality too  .
my son no longer brings his ipod video or mp3 but uses the moment and before that the hero  .
i have been using the pandora radio app to listen to music (very interesting) so phone sound quality is pretty impressive and really this is a phone (as well as a computer on the side) so should not it be best in the phone stuff  .
i have not heard of an android phone with poor voice quality yet but i am sure someone will invent one  .
the iphone gets bad marks on phone/voice quality  .
cnet did a iphone verses moto droid about a month back so their marks not mine anyway , i love the apps  .
my phone gets a little bogged down and i fine clearing them off helps  .
i love that all my phone numbers are in the clouds at one of my google accounts  .
it made it really easy to change phones around and you can edit at google i hope this helps some people  .
i also have played with the my touch , and iphone , through friends , so i have an idea of those  .
being a palm user , i almost upgraded to a pre but i think i am a android convert  .
i am trying to get my husband to go for the pre so i can check it out more throughly but from all the reviews , i think i still would like this better updated  .
on mar 2 , 2010  .
before you leave a negative comment , try to use the phone for other than talk and text  .
this phone does everything you need a phone to do  .
things that the normal phone user would not know is possible  .
this phone is highly customizable , phone book links to facebook with users photo albums in your phonebook  .
the phone cremates the iphone , and the so called appstore with 75 , 000 apps  .
(half of those are fart apps) , the android markets is the best i have seen , most are free and legit  .
if your looking for a reliable phone for business use or just looking for a toy , the hero is the phone to get on sprints cheap plans .
with the touch is better tho , you have to use ur skin  .
cannot use finger nails       (  .
i bought this phone yesterday at besy buy , and have had a hard time putting it down for one minute  .
the phone is a great alternative to that other competitor ( cough  , iphone)  .
i have played with an iphone (my cousin has one) and i have an ipod touch  .
i feel that this phone is on the same page , maybe even better  .
android is an awesome system and with htc's sense ui , it is amazing  .
if you are thinking about a new phone , get the htc hero  .
another issue that i want to clear up is the whole sprint sucks thing  .
people , get real  .
sprint's 3g coverage is great , and lost calls never happen  .
go get this phone  .
over all if you have verizon or t mobile i say drop your contract and get with sprint i highly recamend this phone i really do best choice i have made so far .
the best phone a must have  .
you can set up 7 different screens with all kinds of apps  .
i cannot believe all this phone can do and how fast it is  .
the instructions are not the greatest , but if you play around you can have the phone personalized the very first day  .
my blackberry tour is a good phone , but this one is smaller , the screen is bigger , and the browser is much faster  .
the best phone in my opinion sprint has come out with  .
i plan on purchasing this phone come december when it finally becomes available here in the u  .
i am also happy to have read today that they are soon releasing a firmware update to fix the sluggishness that had been reported in reviews i do have one major concern  .
i am switichin gover from windows mobile  .
i am a big microsoft supporter but i just could not deal with windows mobile anymore  .
i did like however how i could sync my contacts and live mail account with my phone effortlessly  .
is there any app available or in the works to support microsft live mail and contact sync  .
i do not really use my gmail account  .
and i have read about the forwarding option but i'd really just like to be able to put my preferred e    mail account on this lovely phone  .
come hang out at http  //www  .
htc    hero  .
com and thanks for reading .
im really happy that i got the hero .
bottom line , i would not trade this phone for anything  .
htc's sense ui is ultimately superior to any other bare    boned android phone  .
it's somewhat sluggish at times , but nothing that interfere's with loving the phone  .
it's not that bad of sluggishness it's a way superior phone to any out to date  .
once 2  .
0 hits , it'll be unstoppable .
great alternative to the iphone from sprint i is torn betwwen this and the htc touch pro2 and went with this under the reccomendation of the sprint sales rep , and im glad i did  .
just gotta keep a car charger with you  .
this is a great phone  .
i am soo happy i chose this phone over the iphone or blackberry .
i feel like i can make this phone do whatever i need it to its primary function is not phone its everything  .
(thanks sprint (and htc) now dan , about that tethering  .
this phone the best phone i've ever owned  .
coupled with sprint's awesome plans , this is a winner  .
iphone watch out  .
there is no such thing as an iphone killer 2  .
some people may want to start by understanding that the iphone is an mp3 player that became a phone  .
all other are phones that want to become mp3 players 3  .
until somebody (and google may do this) creates their own software such as itunes the iphone is going to be the best in this category only because of something very simple , support  .
itunes gives the best support there is for apple's devices 4  .
i had an ipod touch and i just wanted a device that would simplify my life so i could stop carrying too many things in my pockets , this phone did this and more 5  .
applications , one of the big things in the reviews  .
i don't know anybody that has every single application there is in the itunes marketplace , there are just too many  .
it has been 3  .
5 generations of iphone (that is what 3g s stand for right) of course they are going to have more apps than anybody else , but the android market place has just about the same most popular apps as in itunes 6  .
the keyboard is kind of laggy , but is bearable overall is a good phone which gives the people like me which do not like iphone's carrier a nice option to buy .
amazing phone overall , well built , feels solid , easy to get use to , very customizable  .
and for those blackberry fans out there , their is even a trackball on it  .
the screen is nice and large , and the multitouch function is a huge plus  .
extremely fun to use and works for both the fun phone user to the on the go need to keep organized user .
the only reason this phone lost half a star is because the htc droid eris is $80 less  .
they are the same exact phone with just different hardware and phone company  .
i have both the phones and the htc hero's hardware is definitely more responsive  .
sorry cnet but you are fools for lowering the rating of a phone because of a price issue .
i've now had this phone for just shy of a month  .
it is hands down the best mobile device i've ever seen  .
i currently also have an iphone 3g that has been my business phone for sometime now  .
i can say without any hesitation at all that the hero is by far the better phone  .
even if you set aside at t's terrible signal issues , the iphone is still pathetic in comparison  .
i've done a number of basic comparison tests , and in almost all of them the hero comes out on top  .
for example the hero is faster at loading it's browser and websites  .
and yes i made sure to make it a fair comparison  .
i cleared the cache of both phones , killed the browser from the background of the android , and tested multiple sites  .
the hero is always significantly faster  .
i did similar test with applications like shazzam , and pandora  .
the only thing the iphone is faster at is recovering between photos  .
but of course , speed is not everything  .
for me the ability of the phone to multitask is huge  .
i'm a big fan of pandora radio and would often listen to it on my iphone  .
this is ofter frustrating because everytime i need to check email , reply to a text , or use gps , i had to exit pandora  .
with the hero pandora can remain streaming in the background and i can continue to do anything else with the phone on top of everything else i love the way this phone seemlessly works with my gmail , google callendar , tasks (requires free app) , facebook , twitter , etc this thing is social networking swiss army knife  .
i would almost swear that htc has been listening to my personal gripes about every phone i've ever used  .
this phone fits like a glove  .
i'll leave you with one interesting experience my wife and i (we both have heros) were out with some friends getting drinks recently , one of our friends is a project manager for an it company , and is a bit of a tech junkie , and a big blackberry fan  .
she asked about my phone , so i just handed it to her to let her mess around with it  .
she seemed somewhat impressed , but was not really that thrilled with it  .
i then told her that she should perhaps look at my wife's phone , as she had done some different customization to hers  .
as soon as she picked up my wife's phone she is blown away  .
she went on and on about how cool it was  .
i think this really shows just how amazingly flexible this phone is  .
it just seems to work on so many levels simply put everyone owes it to themselves to at least take a look at this phone .
best phone i've used    hands down  .
note   i'm no phone guru updated  .
on nov 9 , 2009  .
good phone , if had slide out keyboard would be perfect .
bottom line change the rating back to what the phone deserves  .
4 stars  .
highly recommend  .
i sell real estate so you know we need something we truly can depend upon  .
it's there the moment i need it  .
whether it's an alarm to remind me of an important appointment , and update on my gmail  .
com email , a text from a client , my daytime agenda , switch to my weekend toy phone  .
i mean really this thing makes my life easier and my job more efficient  .
very user friendly , but do yourself a favor and read the instructions or the basics guide  .
if your with at t or verizon  .
why pay a ton more for service when you can call any mobile anytime , get unlimited internet , text messaging , free gps navigation with voice announcing turn by turn instructions  .
my last phone is the blackberry world addition 8830 the hero absolutely runs circles around it  .
and to think this is only the beginning folks for the android  .
love it  .
do yourself a favor and get it  .
you wo not regret purchasing this phone updated  .
on nov 6 , 2009  .
had a older blackberry , got another bb a curve  .
then got a htc touch pro , was not sure i liked it , but kept working at it and learning what it could do  .
lost that one and went back to the bb curve  .
thought i might even enjoy going back to it nope got an htc hero from bb i'll never buy another phone from sprint  .
got it on sale with the mail in rebate credit at the store  .
plus a $50  .
00 discount (sorry it is for 2 days only) plus my reward zone coupons and is out the door for $123  .
i have been going wow wow check this out oh for kool unbelievable ever since  .
the number of free android apps that are out there will take you weeks to go through the best part is this is google ready right out of the box  .
if you do not already own google stock buy some this phone is going to replace everything out there its that simple its a no brainer it can be as smart or as simple as you want it to be think of it as being a blank slate and you get to design the phone the way you want it to be  .
and not only that when you are done its compatible with everything else you use  .
your email , contacts , documents , photo albums , music , maps , etc , etc hey barack throw away that brick and get a kool phone lol  .
this phone is just great  .
very easy to use the touch screen is not sensitive like some phones i have seen  .
the key board that is on the screen is unlike my blackberry but i have found it to be very to use even though i have big fingers  .
its just a great overall phone  .
this is by far the best phone for sprint users , and is easily the iphone's biggest rival .
best android phone to date  .
i think it can only get better as htc and sprint fix some of the initial bugs and upgrade to 2  .
i think both apple and blackberry have a real competitor now and it's the hero  .
the hero's android software with sense ui will knock your socks off  .
finally we have winner here with the way you can customize the 7 screens to the way you want  .
the future is now here since the hero is born .
i have had my hero now for about a week and i'm loving sprint's network  .
it is so much better then at t  .
the phone itself is pretty good , everything from the sense ui , to the screen and android you cant help but just praise this phone on everything that it does right .
i've had about 4 days with the hero , migrating from an iphone 3g    loved the device , at t i didn't so much heart  .
that said , my initial impressions were that i'd given up something to go with sprint  .
however , over the last three days as i've had a chance to explore the phone , begin customizing , etc i now feel this is one fantastic phone out of the box i had my email accounts (gmail , work    exchange , yahoo) gmail contacts sync'd within 5 minutes or so  .
very easy to do , albeit not quite apple simple , but i believe anybody under 60 should not have a problem   )  .
i've found texting/typing to be a little more difficult on this device than an iphone simply because the dimensions of the hero are a little smaller  .
that said , take the time to calibrate typing to your own style through locale text under the settings options and your typing speed goes way up  .
after i took the 30 seconds to do that , it's been wonderful nice to be able to view some flash media while browsing the web flash apps/widgets on websites (such as audio players) do work   ) very cool  .
the text reflow feature is really cool to as it save your from having to pan to read articles/text of webpages  .
browsing speeds are about on par with my 3g , but i'd say the 3gs is faster than the hero battery life out of the box is poor    but only because of a known issue with the phone not sleeping after sending a text using the default sms app  .
there's a super easy workaround and since i did that i'm getting about 48 hours between charges 2x better than the 3g  .
connection to wireless is easy    no issues there gps works great , but note that it's not turned on by default  .
what's kinda cool is that with it off (to save a little battery life) the phone uses tower triangulation to approximate a location to about 1000 feet  .
with gps on , it has my location to about 10 feet or so   )  .
the phone comes with the usb cable/detachable wall plug    quality is good  .
note the phone does not come with headphones  .
i've been using the standard apple iphone ones with no issue    phone seems to understand call end , switch feature the camera is 5 mp    though this is likely the hero's worst feature  .
photo quality is only so so    but i am sure with an app or maybe an update from htc , photo/video quality should be greatly improved all in all    i'd recommend this device to anybody who has a little tech saavy  .
if you're seeking the simplist/cleanest interface i'd recommend the iphone palm pre over this guy    but if functionality customization are desires this thing wins hands down if you need a phone that makes email/web/texting easy , has good call quality , access to a robust app store , and with solid build quality    the hero is a great option at a really great price updated  .
on nov 3 , 2009  .
huge fan of this phone  .
had it for a little over 1 week and cannot stop using it  .
as a longtime sprint customer , i is considering buying either the pre or a blackberry curve that is , until i read about the hero on cnet  .
demo'd it in a store the next day and never looked back  .
it's like having the best of both the pre and a blackberry , but without all the drawbacks (narrow pre keyboard , lame blackberry non    touch os , etc  .
not sure why anyone would complain about the phone being sluggish or unresponsive  .
it's incredibly fast , almost never hangs , and is very responsive  .
once in a while it will lag for a moment , sure but by and large , it's an extremely fast and capable handheld os  .
i cannot get over all the different things it can do , switching from one app to another in seconds  .
unbelievably awesome it's true that the battery life is not great , but unless you're using the thing constantly all day , you likely wo not run your batter dead inside a day  .
especially if you download and run a free task manager app loads of background tasks chew through the battery  .
bottom line   as long as you charge it every night , you're golden  .
and since it charges over usb (also comes with a wall    outlet adapter) , you can charge it from any computer and i'm guessing you could even charge it through a ps3/xbox 360 console , or heck , even a tv , as many are now being built with usb ports  .
practically anywhere again , i cannot say enough about the integration of the hero's physical design and the os  .
between the well    thought    out touchscreen , the faceplate buttons and trackball the whole device is just super    smart and intuitive  .
i've spent this first week just learning the ins and outs of the phone , but practically any time i've tried to do something with it , thinking hey , this might work it has worked  .
that's the best way i can describe it  .
it's just brilliant , and it makes you feel as smart as the phone itself while you figure stuff out not much else to say really  .
the phone is just completely awesome  .
i love the iphone , but the cost of the data plan is just a bit too much (nearly $100 and no texting included  .
whaaa  .
also heard widespread grumblings of how terrible at ts service/coverage can be a lot of the time  .
i've been a longtime sprint customer , and can say with confidence that their service and coverage is excellent  .
their new $70 any    mobile data plan is hands    down the best value on the market    research it for yourself and see android's apps store is also packed with great stuff    more apps than you could ever scroll through    so why pay more for an iphone , or settle for less with the pre or a blackberry  .
trust me   demo a hero , and you'll be donning your cape in no time now back to detecting metal with my phone .
i've been on a smart phone binge this last summer   the pre , blackberry tour , the touch pro 2 , and now the hero  .
the hero wins hands    down  .
it is so smooth , and i do not even miss the real keyboard the way i thought i would  .
android is obviously the os of the future and it will only improve  .
i had hoped that the palm would make it , but there are too few apps and no real word of what's in the pipeline  .
htc did the best job anyone could with winmo , but it's slow and obsolete .
i love this phone  .
if is very durable  .
has already fallen of the hood of my car and has been run over in the street  .
still worked perfectly  .
i is very surprised  .
i watched a few reviews that showed it lagging at times  .
i have not noticed it  .
i run simple widgets .
i'm absolutely in love  .
i've had a million cellphones since i got my first one back in my senior year of high school (spring 2001) , and i've had lots of touchscreen phones  .
this is not the most powerful phone in terms of sheer processing speed compared to higher powered phones with faster speed chips , and even doing mutliple things , this phone is extremely responsive and quick  .
i keep reading on    line about the lag , but i've yet to see it  .
if the lag is waiting for 1    2 seconds for your e    mail to appear when you've opened the e    mail app or 1    2 seconds for the screen to change to landscape or to portrait mode , then you're asking too much because even the almighty iphone 3gs which i happily sold to pay my etf to get back to sprint to get this device (sprint's network is far more reliable than at t , i'm sorry  .
) would then be considered laggy too  .
even in full bars in 3g my iphone 3gs which is brand new would constantly drop calls , and opening the application store is a lesson in patience ; just took too freakin' long to do , and especially due to the limited nature and extent of reach into the os apps on iphone have , most were just pretty apps with next to no meaning  .
android is different  .
i'll admit   the standard ui on android (non withstanding htc sense) is very , very bland and dull , but it gets the job done , and my app market works everytime i open it  .
i have to be absolutely honest   i had a 16gb 3gs and there is lag with it , too , but no one seems to want to report it because it's the next best thing to sliced bread  .
i cannot say iphone sucks , because it doesn't , but it's not the perfect cellphone it's often portrayed to be  .
my htc hero is , to me at least , far superior to iphone in terms of sheer functionality , quality , reception , voice quality , and as good as 3g and 3gs in terms of speed when running through apps and using the phone  .
plus , this thing is actually customizable   all you can do on iphone is move around your apps  .
that's it  .
i mean , you still cannot , after 3 iterations , run more than 1 3d party app at a time  .
maybe the next one will  .
who knows  .
but then again , all apple might do is make it come in red , with a camera flash and a 5 mp camera , and then bam , it'll be the 2nd coming , but only this time , part 4  .
but in all honesty , i love this device , and for people looking to think outside the box , and give an open source smartphone with endless possibilities , you'll love android , you'll love the hero , and you'll love sprint , because you'll definitely love completing a phone call on your terms far more often than not , as well as falling in love with a much lower bill  .
i'm on the simply everything plan getting , well , simply everything for $99 a month , and on at t , the same thing , (adding at t's navigation software for an additional $10 per month) is bringing my bill to nearly $160    165 after taxes  .
i'm saving money , i'm on a better network , i have a better cellular telephone , i've got touch screen , navigation , multi    tasking , an app store with apps that actually change how the phone works , multi    touch i just could not be happier  .
hopefully the iphone will still do well and that the 4g or whatever it'll end up being will blow the socks off its competition   then the hero2 will be even more fantastic than it already is  .
why buy an iphone when you could walk around with a hero  .
do you want to impress your family and friends  .
buy this phone this is the first phone that has come along in which you can truly consider ditching your mp3 player , your good quality digital camera and your navigation device  .
to start with if you are a music junkie like me there are so many cool free apps to load i dont know where to start , pandora great internet based music site app , shazam    you here a song you dont know what is is , open shazam and in about 15 secs it tells you all the info artist , album even lets you buy the song right off the phone  .
tunewiki want to know the lyrics to a song  .
open tunewiki and it will rip the lyrics from the internet i could go on and on just buy the phone  .
i got the phone as an upgrade and have benn tinkering with it for the past two days prior to this posting  .
it is quite an enjoyable unit and have had not a single problem with it for anyone that is not a p  .
power user you will want to consult the 3 user manuals for operation specifics  .
make no mistake , this phone is all that and you will be rewarded for taking the time consulting the manuals this unit is definitely geared toward the corporate client and jet setter so , if you like new tech and also enjoy stability in the device this is your hero  .
heads up on the android o  .
side of this phone , get a free google mail account first so that you can properly activate your phone fully without a missed step i've had a gmail account since google started the service and have not one complaint  .
this is a win    win situational purchase and upgrade of service for me i enjow google , htc , and sprint so , go figure htc pumps out nothing but , releases solid , reliable products in a quality over quantity mind set and it shows without fail excellence , period .
i had an iphone for 3 days this summer and sent it back  .
att's plans are way too expensive for me  .
after getting the hero , i am convinced the hero is just as good if not better than the i    phone  .
apple you have some serious competition .
this is the best sprint phone to date  .
it feels great in the hand  .
the phone quality is great  .
the web browser is amazing  .
the trackball makes it extremely easy to navigate a web page  .
the ability to customize each scene is awesome the only negatives for me is that the camera has a little lag and it takes a lot of practice to get descent shots  .
i wish it had a flash as well  .
i wish the would have included a spare battery and offered more accessories at release i have found the battery life to be great compared to the samsung instinct  .
if you are a sprint customer this is the phone for you  .
updated  .
on oct 13 , 2009  .
this phone its better my touch .
it has everything the cliche i    phone has but its on the sprint network so it is much faster in a metro like houston  .
feels more durable than my old htc diamond  .
looks and feels solid  .
i've yet to have any issues everything functions flawlessly    the applications in the app store range from internet radio to metal detectors to barcode scanners the camera is a 5mp which worked just fine except in a dark setting it had trouble  .
its not marketed as a new digital camera    its a smart phone    spend $100 and buy a camera if you need a camera  .
good pictures in regular lighting though i havent been able to find bonnie chu's lag in the os  .
everything seems to be flawless    sprint really knocked this one out of the park in my opinion  .
there were people at best buy w i    phones druling over the slightly smaller size and slightly faster web speeds  .
once the 4g networks roll out those poor 3g's will be left in the hero's dust  .
i'm very very very happy with this phone .
if you need a phone buy it  .
the samsung moment comes out nov  .
1st and it comes with a faster processor , however i have absolutely no major problems with this phone , and compared to the iphone the hero triumphs in the aesthetics duel  .
with compact size , efficient ergonomics , and the sprint freebies (tv , nfl network , navi) , the only test i really need to put it through is whether it will run cs source smoothly  .
lol , thanks for your time  .
overall , it  .
s a great phone ; i would recommend it to all  .
i have experienced no lag and have no complaints , nothing but praise but i will inform all that there is a slight learning curve due to the fact that it may do much more than your last phone  .
i don  .
t know how some rated the phone before the 9th but i will say mine has been in my hand for two days , not in a video , or in a store or on a display where people don  .
t realize they have 30+ open apps in the background .
sprints arsenal of phones is great and this is the best andriod device on american soil .
this is an amazing phone  .
if you want an something with all the functionality , bells , and whistles of the iphone , and more , and dont wanna be another apple conformist , get this phone now  .
have been waiting for sprint to come out with a phone that would seriously compete with iphone  .
i think they have it  .
this phone is wonderful , i got it 2 days ago and i cant put it down  .
the display is brilliant , the pictures clear  .
extremely customizable , lots of apps to choose from  .
love it love it love it best $179 i've ever spent some advise , if you qualify for an upgrade buy from bestbuy the rebates are instant .
get it  .
love it .
my sprint store called me last night (10/8/2009) to let me know my hero is in stock and ready to pick up  .
i got the phone home around 8pm and spent about 4 hours playing around with it , and another 3 so far today  .
it has customization options i could only dream about on my iphone (edge and 3g owner , from day one of both)  .
the phone is smaller than the iphone , but fatter , which i am ok with , feels more comfortable in my hands than my 3g did notes   people have several complaints about the phone that are pretty weak    .
the hero wont sync with itunes  .
no phone does , other than the iphone  .
and any phone that hacks the way it talks to itunes apple immediately fixes  .
blame apple , not htc    additionally people complain about the keyboard size    its android , get on the app market place and download a new one , problem solved    it most certainly does support exchange sync  .
i'm using it right now to get corporate email , calendars , and tasks    solid feel  .
removable battery  .
decent camera/camcorder  .
feels much nicer in my hand than my iphone  .
microsd slot  .
great selection of apps (its no appstore , but i'm not complaining)  .
auto    brightness much more responsive than my iphone  .
can run multiple apps at once , background apps (not push notification , actual background apps)  .
does not sync with itunes (honestly , the worst feature of iphone is being tied to this behemoth)  .
turn    by    turn gps is free with a sprint 'everything' plan (although this is carrier specific and not phone specific)  .
much quicker than previous reviews have made it seem , definitely more responsive than my iphone (s)  .
can pull contact info from facebook right into phone contact (image , e    mail etc)  .
plenty of fantastic apps out of the box  .
can delete unwanted factory apps (apple weather , stocks , notes , and cal apps  .
pfft  .
can use standard mini    usb for charging/syncing  .
no $20 apple proprietary cable  .
im sure i will find plenty more as time goes on  .
i will probably miss the beauty and ease of use of the itunes player in my iphone  .
doesnt dim when you put it to your ear  .
apps run in the background and sometimes you forget them (this is easily resolved if you download a process manager application from the marketplace)  .
as i've said , i've only had the phone since last night , but i am already glad i terminated my att contract  .
i get better reception in my apartment , i havent dropped any calls (id average at least two on my iphone by this point in the day)  .
this phone is customizable like whoah , and feels fantastic  .
good call quality , visual voicemail , nice ichat inspired mms and sms chat timelines (definitely one of the best iphone features , and surely one to copy) definitely head and shoulders above the other iphone killers and definitely a worthy adversary to the iphones dominance  .
i've been using iphones since launch several years ago , and never thought i'd give it up  .
today i'm glad i did updated  .
on oct 12 , 2009  .
great device .
for anyone that has come to this site looking for a fair review of this product left by consumers , you should only read reviews left october 11th , 2009 and later  .
anything that is left prior to the oct 11th date should not be taken seriously  .
hopefully someone from cnet will read my post and delete all of the posts left prior to october 11th  .
any person that is given a beta model to test for website reviews should not be allowed to post here since the device is a beta model , and any kinks that may have been in their test devices are usually worked out via a firmware update before its released  i do not work for sprint/nextel , i do not work for htc , i do not work for google , i do not work in the cell phone industry  .
i am a techy person who is researching the htc hero and is puzzled on how consumer reviews of a device not even released could be posted on a website updated  .
on sep 26 , 2009  .
the bottom line as opposed to what that troll remo_williams is saying , htc hero is the best phone on an open    ish platform for people who do not like to be held down by a big corporation like the apple or microsoft sure , capacitive touch screens have its flaws , but that's what that troll's iphone is using too seriously , his review should be removed for all those idiotic statements capacitive touch screens could also be programmed on the software level to make it a bit more accurate , but on a handheld of this size , how accurate do you want it to be  .
it's supposed to be a phone and a casual pda where you can type and browse the web with media functions  .
it's not a drawing pad for engineers and architects  .
who wants a resistive screens only accurate with a stylus with no multi    touch on a phone such as this  .
there is an ui lag on this , but a firmware that utilizes the memory better should fix this problem  .
you can watch videos on youtube for a demo of how the firmware makes the ui smooth , definitely better than the iphone 3g  .
3gs , however , cannot really tell att's 3g service is also prone to disconnections  .
sprint's 3g network is much better , and only behind verizon in some locations  .
as a whole , sprint's 3g network is the best in the country  .
att is only number 3 because there's only 4 of them (sprint , verizon , att , and t    mo) and t    mo just started 3g last year another huge problem with the phone is the camera  .
despite its 5mp camera , the quality is just not good , but htc could fix this problem software side    if i could drop the picture in photoshop and adjust a few colors to make it look natural , htc could do this from the software side  .
but the let down is , with no flash , taking pictures with low lighting is not recommended p  .
real rating is 4 stars but i have to offset that troll updated  .
on oct 11 , 2010  .
almost perfect  .
i love this phone  .
it has more apps than one could ever use  .
i like everything from the design , the various customizable interfaces and 5 megapixel camera .
a great midrange android phone for sprint  .
cannot wait to see what the replacing legend does for sprint .
i took the plunge after a great deal of research and got the htc hero last week  .
so far i am very happy with it  .
this is my first smart phone , my last is a samsung rant  .
my renewal came up for sprint , and as much as i liked the thought of the getting the evo , i   a) did not want to pay the extra $10/m , b) 4g is not available anywhere near me , c) i think the phone is too big , and d) i didn't want to pay $200 for the phone , call me a cheap    o  .
the hero on the other hand is a bit more pocket size  .
for me the virtual keyboard has been difficult to adjust too coming from a physical , but so far i am doing pretty well with it  .
i have not encountered any issues with lag that to me would be in anyway bothersome , but after testing it , the evo is faster  .
as far as the battery life goes , i have been presently surprised compared after 9 of 10 reviews warn of the battery life  .
i have been using the phone fairly heavily and it still lasts me a full day without a charge  .
one thing that may separate me from other users is that i do not have my phone set to automatically check for myfacetwitters automatically  .
i just look at them when i'm bored basically now , as far as actual phone use  .
i am very happy with the reception and call quality of this phone  .
this phone gets 2x better reception than my samsung rant at my house and even in bad coverage areas , my call quality is still quite clear last thing is that i is very happy with the price  .
i am a techie , but seriously doubted my excessive use of the phone so i wanted to stay in the mix between quality vs price and i found this phone to be the best choice out of all the major carriers  .
otherwise i would have without a doubt got the htc droid incredible on a verizon contract updated  .
on jun 17 , 2010  .
good phone  .
great size , but of course it could be bigger for screen viewing of shows or internet , but cant really have that both ways  .
home button placement aint my favorite down there and they could ditch track ball and the search which i dont use much either  .
wish i could tap screen to bring the screen back instead of the red button  .
should b able to shake phone to bring light on  .
on contacts screen i wish they would separate the call and send message touches so that u dont hit one instead of the other  .
sprint tv aint bad  .
learning curve is quick and set up ims no problem  .
email had to b done manually cuz i have verizon  .
wish main screen had more room for icons  .
clock takes up most of screen  .
i guess i could customize that  .
havent figured it out  .
another thing , the metal part at bottom kind of seems loose , but it has tactile response so i guess that is ok  .
doesnt bother me much  .
bottom line is the pros way outweigh cons  .
i am only on day 3 with this and this is a keeper updated  .
on jul 16 , 2010  .
this phone does everything you would expect from an android phone  .
the fact that it runs htc sense makes it even better  .
the phone will occasionally lag , but it its not enough to make you scream in frustration  .
i mentioned before that the keyboard will lag if your a fast touchscreen typer  .
you can actually decrease the lag by turning off the haptic feedback  .
internet speed is definitely good when using 3g  .
the phone comes loaded with android 1  .
5 , but the official 2  .
1 update is released not too long ago , so make sure you download it  .
overall , it is a high quality phone that you will not regret getting .
i like the hero because it sticks to the best and basic features of a good smartphone like     .
mutlitasking  .
email  .
exchange support  .
sense ui makes the phone easy to use  .
a million times better than a windows phone ( i will only buy android phones from now on)  .
if your switch from a blackberry to this phone its a great transition  .
as stated before the battery life isnt the worst but its not the best  .
i'd by another htc product    the phone has never failed me  .
i is struck by lighting (no joke) with the phone in my hand summer of 2009 and the phone still works .
its an easy to use phone that you can personalize just how you like it  .
if you're like me and anti proprietary apple , then this phone is for you  .
don't be left out in the cold while all your pals are sporting their fancy touchscreen devices  .
the android os is linux    based , meaning tons of absolutely free apps and lightning    quick community support  .
another major advantage over a certain other phone   user    replaceable batteries  .
that's right don't worry about sending in your precious phone for service when your battery stops holding a charge  .
just do a few google searches , and you'll see that there is a vast ever    growing android community full of software developers and users ready and willing to help you out should you have any questions or problems with the phone at all  .
at the moment , it's fair to say that there is indeed something lacking in the games department when compared to the otherphone / otherpod touch and that is caused by a program size limit imposed by the os , which i hope will soon be addressed  .
it doesn't bug me though , since i did not buy a phone to be able to play games  .
i bought it to talk on the phone along with having constant net access , along with wifi capability , finally having a real mp3 player (no , i've never owned one 'til now) the list goes on and on  .
like i said in the cons field do go download a decent task killer app  .
it is absolutely a must    have for this phone due to the phone not fully closing apps running in the background  .
a slight disadvantage which only bothered me at first is the lack of a physical keyboard  .
within a couple days of use , though , i got quite used to the onscreen keyboard  .
if you make a typo (which i still do) , the auto correct / word guessing feature is quite snappy and intuitive , making messaging a breeze  .
on the battery life issue yes , the stock battery is pretty terrible for operation time  .
there are quite a few settings you can change to help fix this  .
the stock messaging app is mostly to blame here       there's apparently a bug in it which causes the cpu to not enter its sleep mode when the screen is off  .
solution   use a 3rd party messaging app  .
problem solved  .
all in all , the pros far outweigh the cons with this awesome phone  .
oh and the price is pretty nice , too which is sure to go down even further in the near future as newer phones hit the market  .
also , when coupled with sprint's very competitive unlimited data plans , it's almost a no    brainer bottom line   buy it .
former blackberry and iphone user and i prefer this  .
i have been trying to sync google on my iphone and bb effectively for the last two years and have been unsuccessful until now  .
the google integration on this device is remarkable  .
the keyboard is a little cramped compared to the iphone , but i am getting used to it after having the phone for three days  .
call quality is superb  .
the web browser is slightly better than the iphone  .
i have noticed that the 3gs didn't render some pages as well as the hero  .
there are a lot of tips and tricks to this device  .
they are not obvious , so you need to seek them out  .
the 2  .
1 update (coming soon) will be a great addition .
i held off writting a review on this phone till i had it a least a month  .
some of the issues i held off buying one because of the reviews on cnet and the sprint site , they seem to be 90% taken care of now  .
first the firmware upgrade to ver  .
651  .
2 is alreay installed on my phone out of the box , the phone is in fact a evdo rev  .
a , if your phone shows rev  .
o it is not a malfunction it is that you are in a rev  .
o area my phone shows rev  .
a 98% of the time  .
the htc sense ui is nice , but i believe that the sense ui is what is holding up the 2  .
0 or 2  .
1 andriod software upgrade  .
the people writting that their phones are awake a high percentage of time , might be looking at the status at the wrong time , if you turn on your phone and make a call , go online and check e    mail right away , and then look at awake time , it will be near 100% , it seems it updates the awake time all during the day , i use my phone quick a bit , set to check 2 different e    mail accounts every 30 min , make about 6    10 calls , check the weather online , text about 15 times a day , go online about 3 times a day  .
my phone is charged every night , it comes off the charger about 8  00am and is about one green bar at about 12  30am , and at the end of the day my awake time is about 16%  .
i am looking foward to see when sprint and htc will get the andriod 2  .
1 upgrade out , i hope that upgrade will go without a problem , but right now with 1  .
5 and the firmware upgrade to 1  .
56 the phone is working fine and doing what is was advertised to do .
android is the best , if they do not muck it up with carrier limitations great new google maps with earth overlays , voice directions and speech input are available , but  .
sprint is slow releasing them to customers overall best phone i've seen .
i am very satisfied with this phone , some of the apps are wonderful and they work well with the phone  .
i like how it keeps everything together for you from facebook accounts to emails photos and text messages they are all right there for you  .
just dont cheat on your girlfriend and you will be fine .
love this phone  .
htc got cheap with this product it only ships with home charger  .
in contrast my htc touch diamond came with a headset , carrying case , and screen protector  .
the phones os is much better than windows based phone , and  .
all the freezing up that is experienced with those phones appears to be a dead issue with this os  .
the availability of apps out the a$% makes this phone a must have  .
there's something for everyone in this phone  .
the phone syncs with my outlook as well as with my google profile  .
productivity with this phone is going to be up  .
web browsing is easy and effective upgraded to a 4gig micro sd for added storage capabilities  .
phones security with the pattern draw access makes it hard to get into for anyone that's not suppose to be in to your device .
let's be honest  .
the hero is still a very you piece of hardware  .
while we're at it android is a you os too  .
when the most recent update rolled (i think in september) it is like a whole new phone  .
before that , sever criticism is warranted  .
honestly , i'm having trouble finding bugs that are not app related  .
in my fiddling with an iphone friend , the hero compares favorably with the 3g  .
i don't know about the 3gs , it would probably be a little clunky in that comparison there are two things that just aren't intuitive  .
alarm volume is a separate setting from every other sound and it is not available in the phones settings  .
the one spot to change the alarm volume is in the pop    up where you set the alarm sound , just press the volume rocker  .
it's not bad once you know that , but it is not addressed in the manual  .
in the dialer , if you tap a name , it starts a call  .
you press and hold to open up the pop    up to select mms , edit contact , etc once you know this , you stop feeling like the phone is making calls by itself  .
i might ask for a little customization of the incoming call screen  .
the hierarchy of visual importance goes contact picture , phone number , name  .
i would prefer the name to be larger than the number i've read that the hero can be a little sluggish  .
this can be true  .
it does not really keep up very well with high bit    rate music and will chug along a little (128kps is good 256kps gets a little sketchy)  .
when you are running relatively heavy apps like the browser or a graphic intensive game , it does take a moment to wade through the program and start the ring tone to notify you of a call  .
this is not out of line with similar phones , definitely better than windows mobile and really not much slower than iphone there are some apps that kill phone performance , whether they are actively running in the background or not  .
if you keep tract of the last app you installed and what it does to your phone , you can uninstall an app that slows down your phone  .
the way android manages resources , app killers are largely superfluous (although they are nice for force quitting the occasional hung application)  .
i would just kill the app killer once killing the app you want to kill  .
programs are cached in the ram , but most are not actively taking clock cycles in the background (ones that do should appear in your notification drop down) , when a new app needs ram an unused program will be kicked out and the new app gets the ram it needs  .
for me , this is seamless , and android really does not need much babysitting to keep running smooth for such a young os , android is very strong and stable  .
my mother , who decides things are impossibly confusing before calming down and going step by step , has found this phone to be innately usable  .
with just a little coaching , she is buzzing right along using the entire phone  .
before that she is doing just fine making calls and sending texts  .
this phone is fully capable of running android , but it can be taken down by clunky apps  .
although i suspect those apps would shackle the more powerful moto droid and the nexus one updated  .
on jan 6 , 2010  .
i had the palm pre right before th e hero and loved the pre but i had way to many problems with it i went through three pre's since october  .
so far the hero has been a very good switch for me this does what my pre did but a little better smoother and faster  .
the hero is one of the best phone's i'v had from sprint so far hopefully this one will work out better than my pre .
i think it's a great phone with a lot of promise due to the availability of so many cool applications .
i've had the hero for a several weeks and i'm still customizing it  .
there are so many customization options that it borders on the ridiculous  .
this phone is truly my own  .
htc/google has done an astounding job with the hero/android and it makes my beloved palm centro look like it came from the stone age word to the wise   at first you'll only get 6    8hrs of battery life  .
i almost returned mine because of this  .
however , after letting the battery fully die and recharge a few times i is able to get the lifespan everyone raves about some problems   android 1  .
5 is not fully baked and is missing basic options such as the ability to close a program without a 3rd party app  .
apps run in the background without any prompting , draining battery life  .
why  .
the security is terrible  .
google has gone gimmicky instead of common sense  .
instead of a password to unlock the phone you have a connect 4 board that you swipe your finger across to connect circles in a pattern that you predefine  .
it wouldn't be too difficult for someone to break into the phone if you leave a tracking smudge  .
an actual password (or at least a numbered keypad) option would be nice  .
also , you cannot display owner info on the unlock screen ; so if you lose it you'd still have a chance of getting it back the htc pc sync software is pathetic and borders on the inept and useless  .
the newest version that is just released (2  .
08) still cannot install on win7 (xp/vista only)  .
fortunately i have a dual boot system with vista still installed  .
i spent 45mins trying to get it to sync with my phone  .
i finally gave up and started working on something else  .
about an hour later the phone inexplicably sync'd without any prompting from me  .
apparently i'm spoiled by palm's competent and robust desktop software there's a ton of great (and best of all   free) apps on the android market , but too many are worthless fartware apps  .
fortunately there are enough quality (reiterate   free  .
) apps to help you round out your phone  .
most useful (and necessary because of android's shortcomings) is task killer  .
also , ringdroid and where's my droid are must haves  .
where's my droid (and similar apps) allows you to find your phone if you lose it  .
this is a premium paid service with winmo and iphone , but with android it will set you back one mighty dollar a few minor gripes with the app market   it categorizes software into two categories (apps/games) but at the very least it should be four (apps/games/ringtones/novelty) to weed out the novelty apps from the useful  .
trying to pick out the good apps amongst a sea of fart apps would be easier  .
another is the star rating system  .
who picked the color scheme of light green stars sitting next to white stars  .
it's very difficult to determine the rating of an app with this color scheme  .
what's wrong with a simple numbered rating  .
another weak point for market is , ironically , the search function  .
if you're trying to search for a list program (or whatever) and accidentally type lis and hit enter , you'll get a message stating that there are no lis programs rather than return a result of programs that starts with lis  .
despite those gripes , i could not be happier with this phone  .
my biggest concern is how the unlock phone system works  .
the hero is a sleek , slick phone that has done nothing but surprise me with its power , usefulness and customization .
if you want a quality phone with a lot of great features that is easy to use and fun as well , you should get this phone also , compare how expensive the at t plan with the iphone is compared to all you get with sprints basic price    unlimited gps , sprint tv , unlimited messaging , browsing , email    its a no brainer  .
dont get me wrong    i love my ipod touch , but after all the stories about poor call quality , dropped calls and at t's 'al a carte' pricing for everything , i think sprint is the best deal around , and the htc hero is an excellent smartphone  .
the onlly reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because i think everything has room for improvement , but this phone is better than ll the ones i've tried over the past few weeks    go get one  .
there are some really great reviews out there so i don't want to repeat what's already been said  .
just want to add as a pro the ability to access and use the microsd card as a usb drive which makes file management simple and you do not have to take the phone apart to get to it also , included on the sd card (also available via the htc site) is the htc sync software which enables you to sync up with outlook contacts and calendar as well as other functions if you want a phone that does it all at the best bargain then this is the logical choice  .
htc and android 2  .
0 got it right  .
if you are a sprint customer or considering becoming one    this phone is it and becomes even more attractive when it comes time to select a plan  .
be sure to ask about discounts  .
military get 15% off of the plan price .
my experience so far has been outstanding  .
if i run into any problems i will update my comment anyone interested in knowing more about the phone (canadian version specifically) gimme a shout  .
mattprime86@hotmail  .
com  .
bottom line , i used to enjoy this site , but now i see how easily what i read is altered and how there is no real integrity behind it  .
i'll still visit , but far less .
i haven't had a contract in years , but i needed a new phone as my 1st generation samsung instinct went on the fritz and the wife needed a new one as well  .
i knew i didn't want at t and i'm not to crazy about apple products in general , though i will say at t is getting better in the atlanta area i'm in metro atlanta 99% of the time so wide network coverage was not much of an issue for me , but great 3g local coverage is  .
so it came down to my existing carrier , sprint , and verizon verizon is far superior for travel but b/c i don't travel much the sprint data plan easily trumps verizon  .
if i traveled alot , i would go get a eris from verizon but i needed to sign a contract b/c i didn't want to drop $1000 on phones  .
so my wife got the blackberry tour which she loves , and i got the hero , which is so sweet using the hero is a breeze and so intuitive , it just kinda glides if that makes sense  .
i also was not crazy about the track ball at first but i must say it's very handy i'm a software engineer by trade so i wanted something i could play with , and android filled the void i did not like the default keyboard at all , kind of a pita to use so i downloaded another which is much better  .
only use it in landscape mode  .
if i had to email all day via work , i'd get a blackberry , i  .
e physical keyboard also download a task manager so you can monitor/close programs not in use but open the other thing i might change , would be to switch the 'menu' button and the 'home' button , i just find i go 'home' more and the 'menu' button is better place for my thumb camera is decent at best , but i expect that from all phones battery life is not bad , but i take public transportation and use my phones more for multimedia than calls , and a full charge is done by the end of the day for me the phone itself is a nice form factor but i put a tough body glove case on it anyway so i do not break it , so it thickens it up quite a bit , but not enough to make a difference in my pocket also download 'pandora' for music  .
i downloaded some golf apps , yahoo finance stuff , new facebook app , wikipedia app , wi    fi app ,  .
have had the sprint hero now for a week  .
first , let me say that i am a medium    light user  .
this means that i need my phone for calling primarily folowed by   checking gmail and work outlook , occassionally surfing the web , streaming pandora , and checking football scores  .
i is torn between the palm pre and the hero , and in the end , decided on the hero mainly because of the form factor and the number of free apps available  .
i actually like the pre's os better , as it's easier to use  .
so , after a week , here's what i have found   first , the touchscreen keyboard is taking lot of getting used to  .
the screen is just small enough that i miss a lot of the keys and it has been rough typing texts  .
i have heard that you get used to it , so i am keeping my fingers crossed and not really knocking the phone b/c of that  .
second , i'm disappointed that during a call , you must first hit the hard menu button located at the bottom of the phone to bring up a menu , in which 'mute' is an option  .
while not a huge deal , it is a problem when you need to mute the phone quickly and have to go through 2 steps instead of just hitting a mute button on the screen  .
i'm in conference calls all the time so that is an issue for me  .
overall , call quality is awesome , warm and clear  .
at the top of the phone , the ear area boasts a nice and large speaker so that you do not have to have it exactly over a single spot on your ear to hear the caller , like my previous phones did  .
plus , the call sounds more like a landline then a cell phone  .
huge plus for me  .
as for contacts , i use gmail , so it imported all my contacts for for me into my phone  .
that is nice except gmail sucks for the way they handle contacts , meaning they add every single person you email into your contact list and brings it into your phone  .
you must manually go and delete all the non    favorites from your gmail account periodically  .
not a problem with the phone , but with gmail  .
however , there is a speed dial widget to add to a screen in which you can simply hit the person's face and it will dial , text , or email that person  .
very nice except it is not as easy as it should be  .
first , you must add a person to your 'favorites' folder in the 'people' application  .
after adding a person's number to that widget , you cannot add them again for their email or secondary number  .
the widget assumes that once you put them in there , that is it  .
lastly , you cannot edit those people or remove them from the widget  .
you must go into the 'people' app and edit or delete them from your favorites , and then they will disappear from your speed dialer app  .
very cumbersome and i find similar things in many of the apps  .
however , not a huge deal since once i got my phone setup , i rarely need to change it and i only call the same 5    6 people all the time next is the speed of the phone  .
i know a lot of discussion has focused on the speed of the processor , etc let me tell you the phone is very snappy and runs great  .
i have no lag , other than the short period it takes to open a new application  .
i compared it to my friend's iphone , and they both open apps at the same speed  .
the negative to this os is that while you can have multiple apps open at one time , there are no easy ways to toggle back and forth between open apps , nor is there really a way to see what is open or do you have the option of closing down an app  .
instead , you must download a taskkiller app to shut down apps  .
again , that is fine , except that i must run it many times per day and taskkiller always shows a bunch of apps open that i never opened  .
so , not sure what's going on there  .
the only way to switch between open apps is to either hit the 'home' key and hold down the 'home' key for a few seconds , which will bring up a task pane , or navigate all the way back to the application's launch icon and hit it again  .
this is where the palm pre really shines in that you flick through all the open applications and can actually close them  .
if palm comes out with a better form factor and larger screen , i will swith to it in the future  .
also , i must reboot my phone every few days in order to keep it running quickly  .
i noticed after 3 days the phone is getting really slow , and even after closing all open apps , it is still extremely sluggish  .
after rebooting , things were fine  .
again , not a huge deal and just something i plan to do every few days overall , very pleased , and i love sprint's service  .
the phone works great as a phone , internet looks awesome , and free apps are nice  .
it is not the iphone (yet) and definitely needs some more spit and polish , but i expect android to make up a lot of ground in 2010 and push the gap between it and the iphone very close battery   life is short , but after turning off some of the services that were connecting to internet constantly , battery is good now lasting through a full day no problem .
if your a sprint customer and do not want to leave , this phone will bring you as close as you can get to the iphone , hate to compare but the iphone has set the standard .
after coming from a palm pre , this phone does so many things well  .
my main complaints with the pre were poor reception (couldn't get a signal where other sprint phones had a strong signal) , poor battery life , no real app support , and limited customization (could not even change the text msg alert) the hero does all of those very well  .
even though it is a full touch screen device , the battery lasts close to two days almost double the pre  .
android marketplace is awesome as well as the reception  .
overall this is the top sprint phone in my opinion .
it's honestly made my life easier  .
i keeps me in touch with friends and it keeps me organized  .
it generally runs pretty smoothly  .
lots of great features and apps  .
having seven home screens is amazing  .
if you're considering buying this phone , i say do it  .
for sure .
my iphone friends could not stop jawing my ear off about how incredible their phone is  .
frankly it put me off as apple fan boys can do and i was not about to jump ship to at t which has notoriously bad phone service  .
i considered the pre for a little while but when the hero came out it is getting high marks from a lot of blogs including cnet so after alot of consideration i bought it  .
i've had it now only a day but it's such a jump up from my treo that i'm having a hard time getting a clear understanding of the phone's uses  .
from the apps to the customization of the phone's interface , it's gadget geek manna  .
the phone feels solid in my hand which i very much like but the first complaint for me is a lack of a physical keyboard  .
maybe it's because i'm used to a physical keyboard so i hope i'll adapt and get used to the virtual one  .
i'm burning through battery juice like crazy as i cannot seem to put the phone down playing with the apps and learning how to use all the options  .
i imagine as i settle down with it and have it dialed in to my personal style of use the battery will last longer for me  .
it really has alot of features that will take some getting used to before i feel i know this device  .
i'm sure i'll have alot more to say in a month's time but for now , i'll say that , perhaps the iphone is still considered tops , i have a hard time imagining this phone could be considered second fiddle to anything on the current market  .
definitely happy so far updated  .
on nov 12 , 2009  .
i've had this phone for about a week and have absolutely no plans to return it  .
i personally chose this over the iphone because sprint's network and data plan are way better than at t  .
i am so happy with my decision  .
i love how i can put anything on any one of the 7 homescreens to make all of my favorite programs/apps so easily accessible  .
i get great call quality even with 1 bar and have so far not come into any areas of no service and i am always on the go from city to city around the puget sound i've experienced 2 or 3 moments of lag but nothing major , just too much going on at once and me not wanting to wait for the phone before clicking buttons rapidly (much like when your computer's web browser does when you click too many buttons in a short period of time)  .
the only app that i experienced lag with is pandora and that's definitely the app , not the phone  .
i really wish this phone were already able to sync properly with some multimedia device on my pc as it would make for a lot less google searching for solutions but i'll just have to wait for possible updates in the future however i do hope they do something about this to make the hero more user friendly to people who are not too technically inclined i had taskkiller on my phone , but subsequently took it off as the hero actually kills the programs on it's own and doesn't need this  .
when you hold down the home key , it's not actually showing all of the running programs , just the last 6 programs that were accessed  .
also , the android market is great and has an app for absolutely everyone no matter age or interests  .
this is my first experience with a smartphone and i can say that it is well worth the switch the first few days , i is supremely disappointed with the battery life as i would charge my phone overnight , and struggle to keep it alive by 5 in the afternoon , but after disabling all notifications from the stock sms client , and pop up notifications from handcent , there is an incredibly significant difference  .
the battery now lasts me all day and i use this phone all day  .
i'm a student so i am online with this thing all day long , watching videos , listening to music , keeping in contact with friends , and just web surfing  .
the multi    touch zoom is great  .
it's not jerky for me unless i go too fast , although i like to do it slowly to have more control over the degree of zoom  .
the notifications system is great and fun to use for me personally thinging of going to a smartphone  .
do it whether it be this or any other phone it is well worth the money  .
just today , i is buying a new computer for my girlfriend and after the salesman gave me his little pitch , i had a few laptops that stood out to me as possible choices  .
one absolutely priceless ability that i is able to take advantage of is using the voice search program  .
i just said the name of the machine and model number into the phone and the phone pulled up a google search of that product for me and i is able to look up customer and editor reviews on the products before i bought one  .
d it is fantastic and a few customers actually came up behind me to check reviews with me and comment on the phone  .
it is pretty cool so in closing , i chose the htc hero over apple's iphone , verizon's env touch , t    mobile's mytouch (i just switched from tmobile) because tmobile and at t's networks are no good in my personal experience , verizon's phones are no good for me aesthetically and their plans are too pricey  .
i like the phone better than the iphone because i can take a picture of me and my family or girlfriend and put it on my background , or download the wallpapers app and choose from hundreds of different wallpapers whenever i get bored of mine  .
i can choose different themes to get new icons and i'm an artist so all of this stuff is important to me  .
i don't like apple's stranglehold on the services they provide and their interface  .
i love the iphone honestly , i really do but it's lack of personalization bothers me  .
however the main reason i chose sprint over at t is that it's pretty hard to beat their everything data plan at $70 a month for unlimited calling to any cell phone provider , unlimited internet , text , email , etc and 450 landline minutes  .
all of that together puts the hero at the top for me  .
(btw , i'm still within my 14 days and can leave for another phone/provider but i won't be  .
best phone out in my opinion  .
but if all you want to do is use it as a multimedia device more than anything , i'd say you'd be better off with an iphone    james  .
i didn't expect to write so much so if there are any errors in spelling/grammar just do not let it bother you too much updated  .
on nov 1 , 2009  .
it is the best phone i ever owed  .
the size is perfect  .
the phone doesn't feel cheap  .
it serves as a very good mp3 player  .
the keyboard takes a while to get used to , since i use to own a motorola q  .
after getting used to it , it is not an issue  .
one thing that is annoying is the calendar and contacts sync  .
the phone creates two calendars and contacts , one from google and another one from outlook for example  .
the phone gets updated from both sources but don not cross update them  .
therefore , if you update a google contact , it won't update in your outlook  .
if you create a meeting in outlook it won't show up in google  .
everything will be shown in the phone though  .
they definitely need to fix that  .
whatever the phone does not offer , there is an app that can do what you are looking for , i am still waiting for an app to fix the calendar/contacts sync  .
lots of very good free apps are available updated  .
on dec 4 , 2009  .
this phone works great , i cant complain about much anything at this point  .
i have had the phone 4 days and the battery is the only thing that isnt as great as the rest of the phone  .
but it really isnt bad when you turn all the bells and whistles off that most people dont use anyways  .
also with the amazing customization with this phone you can put shortcuts to any you might use sometimes and turn them on and off in a touch  .
i really like this phone  .
i owned the instinct and the touch pro before this one , but i cant say they where evrn in the same class as this phone .
i have been with sprint for ages now  .
i love this phone  .
im not a big htc fan (i had a htc touch which ran windows mobile and i got so frustrated with it that i threw it and cracked the screen)  .
i really love this phone  .
i love the android platform  .
the open    ended apps development  .
this is a really nice phone  .
it takes a little bit of time to learn all the features (i dont read manuals) i love the costumizable home screens  .
the widgets rock  .
i do wish it had a flash on the camera i find it really odd that htc didnt include one seeing as how lesser phones make them standard now  .
i also had one complaint as far as android and gmail  .
if you have multiple gmail accounts as i do make sure the one u sign into gmail with initially is the one u want to stay there b/c if not you will have to do a hard reset to remove it  .
unlike the mail application with htc which allows you to remove them  .
other than that i love this phone  .
the battery holds a charge all day and i'm constantly on the web or playing games  .
clear calls so no muffled or wierd calls  .
i have had it for 4 days now and i am quite impressed  .
i had so much trouble with little glitches with the instinct so i'm glad i finally got a customizable touchscreen phone that seems to work amazing  .
took a little bit getting used to the touchscreen keyboard but i'm getting there  .
would definitely recommend to everyone took me a little bit to figure everything out so just make sure you read the user book that comes with it it will help you out more than you know  .
the apps are amazing and you have loads of free ones to chose from  .
i have played with the apple i phones and this runs neck and neck only the hero is more customizable  .
definitely worth the money and i am overall very pleased with my purchase  .
despite the battery concerns , i have to say i am glad so far i got the phone  .
only on day 2 and a half now but the phone has been everything i hoped for and more  .
changing from a palm centro for comparison  .
own an ipod touch have never owned an iphone  .
i love my touch and have always considered switching to the iphone , but i hate at t customer service watched every review i could find online before i made the purchase  .
my concerns from any negatives i have seen have all been removed now that the phone is in my hands there has been no lag at all  .
the touch screen has required a few second touches , but it has been plenty responsive , but i would give my itouch a little advantage sprint video stuff is knocked on one review but all kinds have worked just fine for me so far  .
im in dfw area so plenty of towers around  .
not as good of a video quality as my touch , but plenty clear enough  .
by comparison , with my centro , i never could get the sprint tv to work portrait orientated keyboard is pretty narrow and sometimes frustrating , i have small hands and it works  .
landscape is much better my battery life is not good the first day  .
left my house and unplugged my phone at 6  30 am  .
by 10  00 pm it is done  .
made three phone calls through the day , spent a decent amount of time playing around with features , but worked all day also so i have to say this is worse than i had hoped  .
i will probably have to buy a second battery just to be safe the sense ui really is cool  .
while you can get more screens on the iphone , i think , there is plenty of ways to get just as much information on the scene that you are running  .
the folder feature alone would allow you to pack everything you could ever want all in one scene in watching so many reviews , i felt like i had a good idea of how the phone worked , and i spent a little time trying to get my sbcglobal email accounts set up ( had to call tech support for sprint) , but it really has been easier than i had anticipated to set things up  .
so i highly recommend you watch the demo videos that can be found at sprint all in all , i have to say that i am glad sprint came out with this phone  .
i have never been a google or android fan , only becuase i had never know anything about what they were doing in the cell phone market , but this phone comes really close to giving sprint customers a comparable option if you are a loyal sprint customer and considering the iphone , check this out as i think you will be more than happy .
stream of consciousness as a future developer , the android platform seemed like a good choice  .
i already have a htc 6700 (replaced by my hero) , and an ipod touch  .
i is looking at the pre , but didnt like the keyboard , and the screen is too small  .
palm also has does not do an open os i like the trackball , but got the sprint insurance because trackballs have a sketchy reliability rate i dont like that it goes to sleep sometimes while in use  .
i've only had it 4 days , so i need time to do all the setups  .
for a day or 2 , i is using both the hero and touch , but as i got a feel for the hero , i rarely use my touch anymore i wish the app site worked more like the ipod site why do apps only run in memory and not from the card  .
on my 6700 , i had plenty of apps on my card  .
speaking of i need to see if any of them can be loaded on the new phone  .
guessing not , though a mobile6 emulator would be nice .
while there is a learning curve to this device and some tweaking of settings required to deliver an optimal experience , this is an extremely well    designed phone with a broad set of genuinely useful features  .
it strikes a balance between business communication and social functionality , and allows the user to set boundaries between the two  .
for example , contacts from multiple sources (fscebook , exchange , flickr) can be linked , but this is not required or automatic  .
the interface can be changed at the touch of button , if , for example , you want you exchange information (calendar , email) front and center during the day , and your socail info (facebook , im , sms , footprints , etc  .
) at the fore after hours bottom line   this device has exceeded my expectations in almost every regard  .
as much as i would like to have access to the much broader range of applications currently available for the iphone , the most important consideration for me is the superior voice and data networks available in my area with sprint  .
at t's complete lack of coverage (or lower quality coverage) in areas only slightly off the beaten path is intolerable , despite the relatively high cost of their service .
there is too much to say about this phone go to a sprint store and try one out  .
the app market is in no way limited and i cannot think of a single app i'm missing  .
amazing phone which works great  .
this phone is a major seller for me because it integrates e    mail and texts into one kind of simultaneous messaging feed  .
contacts are also linked to facebook this sounds silly but gives your phone a professional look with pictures for every contact  .
all i can say is that this phone keeps me 100% connected to my job , friends , and family all at the same time  .
beyond that the phone covers every aspect of my life  .
i have not been to my computer in days except to type papers (updating from my phone)  .
this phone can read pdfs , word , excel , powerpoint , use flash content , and watch you tube videos straight from the page they're on  .
buy this phone and you wo not be disappointed worst that can happen is you returning the phone with in 30 days  .
(sorry it's not a great review but this phone really is amazing  .
check out the features)  .
pretty cliche heading , but i just had to add it there for the kicks anyways coming from an old tracfone , this phone is a giant leap to the modern world of communication  .
from the vibrant touchscreen display to the intuitive user interface to the durability , feel , and heft of this product , there should not be any surprise as to why this phone is considered the 'iphone killer' i mean , over the past couple of years the iphone has faced many challenges against other touchscreen phones to compete for that #1 spot  .
the palm pre  .
the env touch  .
the blackberry storm  .
so on  .
but the main question is   will the htc hero be able to rival    if not , overthrow    the iphone  .
i believe so the hero has many unlocked potential , given that it is the first android phone for sprint and it is the first phone commercialized with sense ui  .
as far as i can see , the only way this phone will lose the interest of american consumers is if sprint's advertising division fails its job in highlighting the hero as what it is   simply a great phone call quality is clear and precise  .
i haven't experienced any dropped calls , no delayed text messages , nothing  .
let's move on now , i know that many people emphasized over the lag that they experienced with this phone  .
in both the displayed hero in the sprint store and the purchased hero , i noticed very minimal lag  .
to clarify , the processor is able to handle everyday tasks efficiently  .
apply common sense when using this phone (in this case , any smartphone)  .
only use widgets or background applications that is necessary  .
use settings that will save battery life  .
download applications in the android market that can manage which apps you want running and which apps you don't want running  .
it should be able to get you through the day  .
no one is gonna die because of the  .
5 second it takes to switch from portrait mode to landscape mode  .
or because you aren't able to swipe fast enough to the next home screen  .
this doesn't mean that i don't support for a faster processor , i still believe that this phone would stand out even more if it has a speed boost , but hey , this is not a perfect world we live in originally , the wo major factors that made me get the hero is durability and customization of the phone  .
the hero is one of those phones that felt solid but not bulky , slim but not flimsy , not too tacky nor slippery  .
this phone can definitely survive a harsh life of abuse and downfall (pun intended) , but it feels too precious to do so , thus a case would definitely benefit you from protecting this investment  .
on the other hand , customization is definitely amusing  .
it took at least an hour to establish the perfect home screen , and at the same time it gives you a sense that this phone is built for you because it allows you to move things according to your schedule and personal preference given that with above average texts per day , casual websurfing , facebook , and emailing , listening to music , limited talking , etc  .
i am usually able to last through the whole day with a full charge of battery  .
it wouldn't hurt to buy a car charger or another battery if you plan on living with this phone 24/7 in my opinion , the keyboard is subjectively double    edged  .
some people just prefer a physical keyboard , while others are slowly adjusting to the advancement of touchscreen qwerty keyboards  .
so far , i am in the middle  .
coming from the last    century , numerical style keypad , i is pleased with the touchscreen qwerty keyboard  .
however , sometimes its nice being able to text without looking for a change though  .
this is probably a minor irritation to every new touchscreen phone users as the majority will learn to adapt to this type of keyboard as time progress i didn't go over the gist of the phone too much because of two reasons   1  .
there are search engines that will help you find more in    depth reviews about every nook and cranny of this phone ; and 2  .
anyone interested in getting a new phone should definitely look into the hero  .
imo , it is better to experience it hands    on rather than hearing it from us tech    savvy freaks (hope i do not offend anyone) ps  .
i still prefer the chinned hero .
i actually am selling my pre on ebay because i went out and bought this phone  .
i'll start with the bad before the good  .
i am coming from a pre so i is used to plugging in my phone whenever i saw an open socket  .
this phone , i do that out of habit but i can definitely tell the battery last longer than the pre battery  .
i haven't gone through the android marketplace for a replacement application now for the good , when i had the pre , i always had a weak signal in two of the three main places i am (my main office at work , our other office place , and my home) at both work places , i never could do much on the phone before i would have the no signal notification  .
on this phone , i have been able to stream music via pandora at a place where , on my pre , i couldn't even make phone calls  .
i love visual voicemail  .
also , when i bought the pre , i is aware that it is a first generation phone so i gave it the benefit of a doubt and worked with it  .
then the longer and longer i waited , the more i realized that the phone still was not getting any more business friendly  .
the calendar took forever to load (to the point that i did not even use it anymore)  .
the calendar on the hero nope  .
no problems  .
i use google for many of my day to day services , so it's great to use a phone that has so many services that i use native on the phone .
the phone does everything a smart    phone should do , plus way , way more  .
i'd even venture out to say that it can do more than the iphone the user interface is very nice ; htc has done an excellent job of taking android as the foundation and making it beautiful  .
their included widgets give the interface a very polished look though battery life could be improved , the phone lasts me ~10    12 hours of pretty frequent usage  .
battery life can easily be extended by dimming the screen , turning off wi    fi , gps , and bluetooth when not using them , disabling/restricting background syncing of email and social networks , and tapping the end button to turn the screen off when not in use  .
htc even includes widgets to easily toggle w    fi , gps , and bluetooth , making it a matter of a single touch to save battery the android market is awesome and i'm really glad sprint has chosen to include it and all its apps for use on the hero  .
it's getting to the point where apple's there's an app for that slogan really applies to the hero , and it just came out  .
compare that with the apps for the iphone when it first came out  .
oh , there weren't any aside from what is preinstalled camera quality is excellent , especially for a phone  .
the camcorder quality could use an improvement , but it's decent enough for facebook or youtube  .
the lack of a flash does not really strike me as odd since most camera phones' flash is hardly effective  .
low    light conditions were better than i expected fot both the camera and the camcorder music playback on the hero is a nice experience , though this is where i found the most instances of lag/glitches  .
playing music back through the phone [either the 3  .
5mm jack or through stereo bluetooth] is a nice experience with very good audio clarity , but the music would tend to 'skip' or stutter if played while doing anything else intensive on the phone the hero can interact with gmail , normal pop/imap servers , and microsoft's proprietary outlook//exchange email , which is a plus for business users  .
email retrieval can be set for every 5 minutes all the way up to an hour or even only on manual download  .
the amount of emails can also be chosen in terms of either days or emails the touch screen is extremely responsive and multi    touch is awesome  .
i would have liked to see it integrated into more of the apps , but this is an android issue and not specific to this phone  .
hopefully with more and more android phones coming out [more than likely with multi    touch capabilities] the app support will increase one of my favorite features so far is the re    flowing of text when zooming in the browser  .
when one zooms into a paragraph that would normally be multiple 'screens' wide the hero intelligently re    flows the text to eliminate horizontal scrolling  .
when one zooms back out the text re    flows to its original position , not effecting the layout of the page all in all the htc hero for sprint is an exceptional phone  .
it's great for the linux enthusiast , the business user , and the average joe  .
the hero has something for everyone ; of you want dead simple web browsing , you have it  .
if you want up    to    the    minute email , im , and news , go ahead  .
being able to customize the crap out of the hero is essential as it makes it your hero .
pros    battery life  .
sense ui  .
not apple  .
amazing qaulity  .
flash player  .
5m cam  .
awesome speaker qaulity  .
turn by turn gps  .
solid feels real nice and not like a toy like the g1 or iphone  .
light up trackball and buttons  .
very responsive auto backlight  .
htc and android widgets  .
best smartphone out in my opinion  .
cheap plan  .
fast network  .
visual voicemail and bookmarks  .
turn music you put on sdcard into ringtones and trim them with built in program instead of downloading an app  .
market is has a good selection  .
cons    ive noticed a little bit of lag but none that affects my phone nut next update should take that all away  .
its on android 1  .
5 but i know they are tweeking 1  .
6 to work with sence ui not phones fault but when it gets it wow i cant wait  .
no multitasking    ( lol but i dont care  .
bottom line     .
get this phone cheap plan i got it the day before release and have been following it for the past month  .
i have not had any problems no dropped calls always on evdo network once in awhile 1x but mostly evdo its so fast  .
beat my friend iphone by a mile and my other friends with the pre just got jealous of me when i whipped this bad boy out trying to say multitasking is the only reason they would stick with the pre but i cant stand that oreo affect it has  .
this hero unit is real solid feels nice in the hand  .
i cant wait for that firmware update real excited to see that  .
just get it if your want a smartphone forget all the others  .
coming from a treo 755 , the hero is from another world  .
so far i haven't missed the physical keyboard which is my biggest fear  .
i've had both palmos winmo and like them both  .
palm pre is an option but i could not dismiss the shiny plastic cheap feel even though webos is cool  .
so , yes , very happy with this purchase  .
lots of great apps for download and i'm sure android updates will only improve the experience  .
oh , big slider on would be great but would get filthy over time so no samsung moment for me  .
i've been waiting patiently for sprint to support an android phone  .
htc did a superb job with the hero  .
it's good that sprint carries this or i would've switched carriers   d  .
beautiful screen htc sense ui is very slick very good performance , rarely lagging standard headphone jack standard mini usb charge/data port (htc cord fits in the same port , adding audio) included htc and android apps are very good (the sprint gps navigator is terrific) lots of downloadable android apps  .
the phone is out idiot  .
we wouldn't do this if we did not know a little about the phone  .
great job htc  .
you really did a great job  .
love it overall  .
i hate that you cannot sync it to itunes  .
not cool .
i flipped through a hero at the local sprint store  .
they said they were not supposed to show customers , but they let me play around with it  .
bear in mind i am by no means a highly technical person  .
i just played around w/ some of the apps , sprint tv , and the virtual keyboard  .
i will definitely be choosing this over the palm pre    the pre's keyboard is terrible , feels plasticky in your hand , and the hero just seems more fun  .
again , sorry for the non    technical opinion .
this is an awesome phone and when i get these headsets it will be the best combination  .

if anyone could please tell me how to mass delete my text messages from the folder please contact me  .
i have been searching for anything to tell you how and have found nothing  .
please help  .
the battery life is low because of the g's i gess , i seen the evo at 1g with more battery life about an houre more , but it is worth it to me for extrea memory  .
the sprint plan is a bounus for alot of free services and a low price to use the mass amount of apps that are free as well  .
i feel it is better then evo .
great phone for the $  .
great phone , unbeatable price  .
if you're looking for a droid phone on a great network (sprint) but do not want to shell out the extra $10 a month for the 4g evo data plan , then this is a great phone for you .
the phone has everything you could want in a smartphone  .
it has almost all the same apps as the iphone (although there are some i would like to see added to android , such as justin  .
tv)  .
you will not be disappointed in the features , like navigation and sprint tv  .
however , the keyboard is not spaced out at all , like the iphone , so you are constantly hitting the wrong letters  .
the built in auto    text correcter is great , though  .
battery life is probably the worst of any phone i've ever had , but i also use it a lot bottom line , i am happy with my purchase  .
if you use google for email/contacts/calendar , this phone is fantastic .
overall i really like this phone but i might get a 3rd party battery for 35  .
00 to give it a bit more power  .
i've had my sprint htc hero for 6 months  .
i also own a t    mobile my touch 3g  .
pretty much the same phones i signed up with sprint because they have a better coverage in my area at first , i loved my phone  .
however , after using this phone for 6 months i have many complaints    .
the first issue , the battery doesn't last more than 6 hours (i replaced this battery 3 times with no improvement) i'm not sure if the problem is the phone or the sprint network  .
my t    mobile my touch 3g lasts 3 days  .
is gsm better than cdma  .
uhmm  .
once again , if t    mobile had a better coverage , i wouldn't have switched i use advanced task killer to extend the life to approx  .
8 hours (still not enough) fyi   i don't talk more than the average person (about 1200 minutes per month) and i send about 500 text messages per month  .
the second problem i have with this phone is the operating system  .
just like windows vista it slows down often  .
it hesitates when you needed the most  .
it does not freeze but the stuttering is annoying another problem with this phone is the lack of a dedicated button to lock/unlock the screen  .
htc should learn a thing or two from apple besides these 3 mayor issues , i still like this phone but would not recommend it to a friend .
this is a good phone from htc and google  .
i love the interface , still a few kinks but all in all a good solid phone .
i don't consider myself a techie by any means  .
i have gone through my fair share of phones  .
before this i had a blackberry curve 8900 on t    mobile and i sincerely thought that is it for me  .
then , i started to get the android itch  .
i had originally planned on going to at t but after i saw what they were doing with android , i changed my mind  .
after careful research and reading review after review , i decided on the hero with sprint i have to say , i'm beyond thrilled about my decision  .
i is very cautious after reading the cnet review and user reviews  .
(what made the review go down after the droid eris is released anyway  .
) most of the trepidation i is feeling is unfounded i have been reading about a huge lag on the phone  .
i wouldn't know because i've installed a task killer that virtually eliminates any lag i might encounter the keyboard is another common complaint i read  .
the phone has a calibration tool in order to tailor the keyboard to fit your typing style  .
after performing this calibration , typing is amazingly accurate  .
i is surprised the largest complaint has been battery life  .
i have that listed as my con , but i have to say , on most days , i don't have to charge it (for the record , i charge my phone every night)  .
sure , the battery life could be better , but it's not terrible  .
i have a feeling that when sprint finally does roll out the 2  .
1 update , battery life will improve over all the performance and interface have exceeded my expectations  .
i got the hero because of htc's sense ui and i'm glad i did  .
it is a very nice addition to android  .
i have to say , something is finally giving the iphone a run for its money and that thrills me i would definitely place the android os above blackberry's , as bb's has become very dated  .
i don't miss it in the least what stopped me from rating it as a 5 is that the hero is not perfect  .
i would have liked a flash on the camera , but i do not use cameras on phones all that often  .
and , as i mentioned before , the battery life is another issue  .
other than that , it's a solid touchscreen device that has exceeded almost all of my expectations  .
i recommend it to anyone considering android .
bottom line   if you can get this phone for a big discount , then you should be very pleased with it  .
there is really much to really love about it  .
my biggest concern getting this phone is using the viritual keyboard for texting , but after you get used to it , it really works well ; and the android market offers tons of apps (not as many as the apple store , but most apps are actually useful)  .
the biggest problem   the lack of internal memory  .
with only 512m of memory available , you will have to pick and choose what apps you want to install  .
it comes with a 2g micro sd card (expandable to 32g) , which is very helpful for storing photos , music , and video , but you cannot run apps off of the expansion card , like you can with windows mobile  .
i sincerely hope the 2  .
1 update addresses this  .
as long as you do not plan on downloading every app in the universe , then you should like this phone a lot , but there are better android phones for the money either out , or about to be released .
great phone  .
very smart features .
very nice lines , good screen , good battery economy , runs all the app's i've loaded onto it just fine  .
i'd buy it again if given the choice updated  .
on mar 15 , 2010  .
first i bought palm pre and returned it in one week in oct 09  .
i hated it so much  .
so not user friendly  .
lots of time wasted trying to get out of one browser to the other  .
i couldn't hear the alerts either  .
i'm a mom who needs a constant reminder all day  .
plus , the keyboard on palm pre is a little too big that i could not reach aa key when texting in hand w my right thumb  .
my hand is too small for it  .
balancing p pre in one hand is awkward since it is top    heavy when it slides and constantly re    gripping  .
so , this hero is my hero after the experience with palm pre  .
not hard to learn but still has a lot it can do for less money than iphone .
best phone i've ever owned , i would recommend it to anybody .
i used the the palm pre , samsung moment , but the htc hero did a better job with having all the contact info you need in one place  .
the paml pre has the best touch screen i have ever seen , but there's not as many aps for it as the andoid os  .
the other problem with the aps for the pre is most of them cost money  .
it will nical and dime you to death  .
the motarola love the big screen and keyboard the slides out , and it seems to be faster than the hero , but they did not put as much thought into the look and feel as htc did .
i picked this phone up at sprint a couple of weeks ago , not even intending to buy a touch screen phone (i is looking at black berries) but once i started playing around with it , i couldn't put it down  .
i'm not the most tech savvy person out there and i'm sure that i haven't even begun to use this phone to it's full extent , but it's a pretty cool little device the virtual keyboard does take some getting used to , but i'm definitely starting to get the hang of it  .
the call quality is pretty good imo , but i'm sure it will depend on the kind of coverage you have in your area  .
the battery life could be better , but it's nothing i cannot deal with personally overall , i really like this phone and it grows more on me every day ps   some reviewers complain about the lack of a physical keyboard why is that  .
there are other android devices out there that have physical keyboards (e  .
the samsung moment , motorola droid)  .
i'm not sure what the point is of knowingly buying a phone without a real keyboard and then complaining about it  .
if you cannot type (or learn to type) on the virtual one , then do not buy the phone  .
it's designed the way it is for a reason .
seems fragile and i worry one of these times i'm gonna drop it when getting it out of my pocket  .
still getting used to phone    as    an    app concept , battery life suffers when everything is on and checking for new content (facebook , twitter , email)  .
the hot phone calls are unsettling  .
am i being fried  .
i really enjoy the sense ui from htc , though the editor is correct that the phone can be sluggish sometimes  .
i came from an iphone 3gs , which is arguably the fastest smartphone on the market , and i'm still impressed with this device .
this is my first phone to have an actual plan  .
before this i use to have prepaid yuck  .
i really love the silly apps like steamy window , bubble wrap game and tetris  .
lol the fact that i can watch tv on the phone is just freakin awesome  .
i honestly would like more scenes because 7 just is not enough for me  .
i would also love a special attachable keyboard or something because i really have a hard time texting people with the virtual keyboard  .
overall i'm very satisfied with my phone .
i am really happy with the hero  .
i would like a better calendar interface  .
so far the speed seems good  .
it connects to my home network perfectly and the gps apps work well  .
so far i am happy with the switch from the palm 700p to the hero ; on sprint  .
also my phone service has improved  .
overall i give it a 90 out of a 100 .
COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE. LIGHTWEIGHT AND NOT BULKY. ACCESS TO SO MANY AMAZING APPS. LOVE THE SCREEN..IT'S BIG AND SOMEHOW DOESN'T SMUG LIKE OTHER PHONE SCREENS.. MAKE MP3'S YOUR RINGTONES. CAMERA IS GREAT; WISH YOU COULD CUSTOMIZE EACH CONTACTS TEXT TONE. OK BATTERY LIFE. TURNING KEYBOARD TO THE SIDE IS A LITTLE SLUGGISH. THAT'S IT SO FAR
ANDROID OS IS GREAT, IT'S VERY QUICK AND EASY TO CUSTOMIZE.. THE PHONE IS EASY TO OPERATE, AND HAS SUPER NICE SCREEN. I'M VERY VERY SATISFIED.. I HAVE PLAYED WITH MY WIFE'S IPHONE FOR A WHILE, AND THE HERO IS WAY NICER.; WISH IT CAME WITH A LARGER MIRO SD CARD. (BUT A TRIP TO FRY'S WILL FIX THAT). WISH THEY HAD A SIRIUS RADIO APP.. BATTERY LIFE COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER, BUT IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE AVERAGE USER, IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MANY HAVE POSTED.
sprint 3g. htc ui. excellent batterylife; its not better than the pre
HTC Sense, Android OS, Google Apps, Gmail, Maps.; Lack of Exchange sync support. Stereo Blutooth support is absent.
Android market: great free apps.. Fast Internet browsing. Great Design. Amazing Camera; Battery Life. Sprint network. Slows down or freezes constantly. End call &#38; Lock Screen is same button.
UI interface. Customizable,. 8000 apps.. New look, feels good in the hang. Love it!. Different; Can't sync with Itunes!!! Lame!!
Very customizable, good value.; Battery life in low, a little sluggish. Freez data.
Web Browser, Customizable Scenes, Widgets, Phone Quality, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Google Maps, Navigation, Trackball, ETC...; Lack of accessories at the get go!
Full of Features. Ease of use for Google users; Battery life. Complicated use. Keyboard. Android needs more/better apps
Andriod apps. Touchscreen accuracy. Size of device. Call quality. Speaker quality. Build quality; Battery life just ok even with apps tweaks
Love the Apps, Multitouch screen, already dropped my phone, seems pretty durable.; Want the 2.1 update already, phone didn't answer call (maybe 3 times), sometimes (but not often) phone gets really slow
features, apps, customization, bright screen, fun; lack of physical keyboard, a bit sluggish, battery life so-so
Nice Screen, good touch interaction, and not a bad price; Battery, but not that bad.
Configurable up the wa-zoo... sturdy. crisp. responsive.; I wanna tether--to my os x --easily. I want more apps. Also want to to be able to organize the programs list.
Everything a smart phone should be.; no flash light for the camera.
the amount of android apps; the phone is light
Touch Screen, Android Platform, camera; Wish it had a keyboard, phone dialing feature is at times complicated.
Pretty fast and easy to use and accustom to. Phone call clarity and reception. Android 2.1. Camera is amazing!; Nothing Yet.
Lets u do what u want, fast internet with wifi or 3g network.... beutiful pictures w 5mp camera must have phone; Little sluggish at times but it needs eclair to run at its max
Multitasks. Very customizable. Great widgets. Open source. Social Networking. Very responsive. Amazing search (thanks google). 5 megapixel camera. Fast downloads. Copy and paste out of the box (apparently iPhone users think thats impressive).; Wasn't released sooner.
Everything the iphone has, and more!; Occasionally doesnt recognize a button press, but rarely. Not annoying at all.
Good at multitasking, good interface, completely customizable. Good apps market; Doesn't handle switching calls (ie hanging up one call while in another) very well. Trackball doesn't light up for notifications as promised. Screen doesn't turn off automatically when in a call
slick operating system/user interface. battery performance. android marketplace is awesome. virtual keyboard works well. great screen; camera not up to par with other phones
Everything; battery life out of the box, but easy fix with certain downloads
Nice screen, very economical on battery usage. So far, all app's I've loaded up work fine.; It does get a bit sluggish occasionally, especially when trying to view large images.
UI, Google integration, responsive, packed with features.; Battery life could be better. I don't like the little green alien.
Beautiful display; brilliant integration with Google's Web-based tools as well as Facebook, Flickr, &#38; Twitter; great support for Exchange; well-engineered form factor &#38; input devices (multi touch + trackball for fine control); highly customizable; Relatively few applications, many of questionable quality; could use a faster processor
Sprint's network, customization options, the OS, the speakerphone, graphics, not a ton of buttons around the outside (just the volume rocker), all in all... everything about it.; haven't found one yet... really.
Using this phone and the OS is about 99% intuitive; What is not intuitive is also not addressed in manuals.
Perfect size... not too big, not too small. Does everything from Facebook, email, Twitter, texting and phone to maps, GPS navigation, music player, Youtube, Pandora, compass and so much more. Good clear phone calls.; Fragile, "phone-as-an-app" concept (still getting used to that), battery life under certain circumstances, ear gets "hot" during calls.
-Great keyboard. -Speedy UI. -Very strong signal. -Visual Voicemail. -Android Marketplace. -GPS is much better than my previous phone; -Battery life. -Music application is terrible. -Music app finds all music files (including files you may just want for your ringtones) so it's possible to have ringtones start playing when you just want your music on random.
Sense UI, responsive screen, lotsa apps, customizable, not that laggy, great battery life...eventually.; Pathetic PC sync software, Android 1.5 not fully baked, questionable security, App Market is frustrating and bloated with childish "FartWare."
It comes loaded w 1.6 NOT 1.5 as "tested" which from what i hear sped up all the lag bonnie discusses. I tested for myself my Hero against the new iphone- the sprint Hero beat the i-phone loading regular sites 3/4 times its smaller too!; slightly steeper learning curve if you dont like reading manuals like me but then its awesome! More alarm ringers would've been nice.
This phone exceed my expectation by a mile. Very easy to use and very quick on performance.; No phisicaly keyboard.
Convienent, mulit functional, easy to use; Lags a little bit some time and the battery drains fast.
Ease of use (if you have spent any time watching reviews and demo videos), features, widgets available, and customization options; Battery life was HORRIBLE the first day (with relatively minmal use)
iphone-like design awesomeness + huge apps store + microSD expansion + trackball + sprint's 3G/data plan = best phone on the market; apps save to internal memory; lackluster battery life (neither being a huge deal tho)
Quick &#38; snappy response to launch apps. Quick &#38; snappy resonse to send &#38; receive messages. True smartphone capabilities (email, Exchange support, downloading files, multitasking, etc.). Bright beautiful screen with response touch interface; Screen could've been a bit larger, scrolling a tad bit smoother, proximity sensor, flash on the camera, better aftermarket accessories, more in-box goodies from HTC, louder external speaker, different colors (at least a black one)
Does about everything my iPod Touch does... sometimes more. Most times, better.; Facebook app freezes up at times. To fix, I go to browser settings and clear data. Read in earlier review that I may need an app manager from Android site to fix. Will try that. Not as many apps available.
Tons of amazing and very useful apps, most of them FREE. Very fast. I like that I can set it up for Business, Weekend and Travel modes. 32 Gig micro sd slot. fantastic camera; Poor battery life, i bought another one
Screen, software, apps, android, google, service plans.; Sprint navigation could use some improvement. Firmware version stuck on the original 1.5 while neat apps only work with 1.6 or above. ver 2.1 is out but not yet availabe thru Sprint
price. features1000's of applications (same games and apps as Iphone). size and weight. bright and colorful screen. Sprint data packages are very affordable. Too many to list; a little sluggish at times
Android market is awesome.this phone is really fast opening and closing running apps. 3g is decent i compare it with t mobile g1 and the iphone way faster.; keyboard and that
Build quality, sense UI, its on Sprint, screen, call quality, upscale subdued looks, in hand feel and more; No outlook task or note sync yet, could be more UI customization (ie, colors , font size), had to change to an everything family data plan, video seems a little low color depth
Google hook up,easy to use,2g's,graphicss are great, free with plan, multiple emails, alot of apps, sprint navagations,no extra fees, Videos and internet all you want.; battery life is 2.5 hrs.
A very good example of an Android Based Phone, HTC's UI is nice, Seems Well built.; Battery life could be better, HTC could have sized the battery larger.
very nice phone...; They really need to update the Firmware to 2.0 or higher ASAP so we can use the Google GPS and it needs add voice text for anywhere it requires where you have to type...
- Feature rich.. - Extendable -- add shortcuts;etc. - Extremely comprehensive design.. - Professional market styling inside and out.. - Handles up to 32GBs (yes, 32 gigabytes) of microSD memory. woOt!; - Will be a little confusing at first without reading the manual.
Sense UI, good processor, excellent screen and picture, Android market, the customization is better than any other android phone, best phone Sprint has.; Video camera is sluggish but nothing android 2.0 can't fix
- feels very durable. - capacitive touchscreen. - 3.5mm headset jack. - sense ui. - widgets. - microsd card slot. - 5mp camera. - android + htc + sprint. - keyboard. - great coverage in my area; - battery life is average. - flash player is simple. - slow accelerometer, laggy when bogged down with running apps, (hardware (processor) is sub-par/ does not compliment the software (sense ui) very well. - no proximity sensor. - keyboard. - no chin
Size and feel are perfect; load, clear calls, Android software superb, lots of additional apps available (most for free), outstanding camera for a phone.; Voice dialing simply doesn't work, mp3 player software leaves lots to be desired; lack of antiquate internal memory is simply unacceptable for 2010.
Switched from a blackberry tour and the difference is unbelievable. this phone is fast, and does TONS of stuff! I love it.; Keyboard takes some getting used to.
Easy texting, so many shortcuts to your messages and phonebook, love all of the apps the android market has to offer.; Voicemail playback not very clear, Dialing calls kind of a pain
The 7 home screens are beautiful and easy to use. The Multi-touch works fine, and text automatically formats on webpages to fit so you don't have to scroll from side to side. Music player is good. Lots of great apps; Battery life is only average
Feels Solid, 5MP camera, camcorder, expandable memory, trackball, large screen, amazing interface, plenty of apps, and customizable to "YOU".; No Media sync software, during intense usage the battery gives you about 5.5 hours, Virtual keyboard kinda small (initially)[you get use to it in time, in landscape though its fine]
I love how you can cahnge the phases of the phone for work or home or whatever you want and you are able to save it different ways for different things.; Cant figure out how to mass delete text messages
Sprint's best device to date. I was so impressed by the phone I registered just to sing its praises. What makes this phone so great? In a word.. GOOGLE. In two words.. GOOGLE Android. It looks great and has tons a great and compelling free apps.; The phone feels cheap. It's too plastic-like.
Best OS yet to date, the size is also very nice. I also love the way HTC did the contacts. Then there?s all the free aps.; I wish i could have given it 5 stars but it does have one problem it can slow down a lot.
Android...enough said. HTC' Senor is nice as well.; cant believe the camera doesn't have a flash, a little larger screen and i would've been in heaven. Lag can be annoying but not frustratingly so
ANDROID, market and the apps, HTC Sense, ease of use, very intuitive, multiple scenes, trackball; virtual keyboard and the learning software, not too impressed, I think my old Samsung Instinct's virtual keyboard was better. I have to type in landscape mode to be some what efficient.
Pros:. -very fast. -great design. -very customizable. -fast browser. -ANDROID. -fast, responsive touchscreen. -so many more; Cons:. -Battery Life. -My only real complaint is that you get. nothing else in the box except phone,. charger, battery, and sd card. For $179,. I would of like to have had some goodies.
Android market, mutitasking, great web browser.; battery life was an issues but there are fixes available and I have made it 3 days now on a single charge with moderate use including phone calls, text messages, light web browsing and push email.
What is not to like? The phone is feature packed and blazing fast. Customization is great, wifi is great, and the web browser is awesome.I like how the virtual keypad predicts what you write and is very accurate; Having problems with Facebook on the web browser. The webpage turns up blank. Otherwise, no problems. There is no lag, no problem with processor speed.
Not Apple. Sense UI. Android (Open-ish and customizable). Flash-lite. Completely different look compared to the GSM version. -slightly better screen. -no chin. -bigger track ball. -better battery. -better camera. -includes a 2GB card; Ancient Processor. UI Lag (Firmware should be applied by the time of release to fix this issue). Completely different look compared to the GSM version! (Love/Hate relationship). -we luv chin!. No flash on camera
Multi-tasking, Wonderful customization, Great build and call quality, Multi-touch browser, Stylish (opinion obviously), Worthy iPhone alternative (again opinion), Sprint's EVDOREV is fast, Voice Search!; Battery life before switching to Handcent from stock messaging app, now battery life is fantastic. Lack of syncing capabilities can provide for a confusing transfer process, Learning curve for Android OS, Youtube quality is pretty bad unless it's HD
Very responsive touch screen! Smooth menu transitions.. Quick shutdown. Crisp clear display.. Great sound quality of built-in speaker AND earpiece! I'm also LOVING the FULL 3.5mm headphone jack!; Without any modding of settings, this thing is a HUGE BATTERY HOG! We're talking recharge every 8-10 hours - and that's with minimal use! Doesn't truly close apps after exiting to the home screen.. easily resolved with a "task killer" app.
No way you can cover the Pros of this phone with 250 characters.... Its that good.; I have big fingers so I have a little trouble using the touch screen keyboard. But I think its a learning curve thing... Because I'm getting better at it.
* Sense UI. * Physical Buttons. *Excellent call quality / signal strength - (side note: other sprint phones constantly roam @ my house, this one sticks on Sprint *most* of the time). *Common mini-usb port. *build quality. *Android OS; The music player could be better audio quality. Battery life could also be alittle better. Lasts a day.. Coming from Iphone, performance could be better. I haven't directly compared the two, but browsing web pages over wifi better on Iphone.
Very customizable. Easy to use once you put some time into learning the software. So many great features. Lots of apps.; Can be sluggish but it's not too bad. Some file management software would be nice. You can download an app but the software should've been a no brainer for the developers.
The Htc Hero is great I love using it with my bluetooth headphones and I am hoping to get these headsets (www.budsgoblue.com) and have the perfect combination for playing music.; I do not like how is still has buttons but hey it is worth it anways.
Solid build, Android market, great features, not clunky. HTC is awesome, they just released a firmware update which fixed the battery life issue and other bugs.; Initial bugs had me worried, but HTC is great and fixed the issues. You will not be disappointed with this phone!
htc I applaud you on your stellar new phone 5mp camera and andriod's operating system is the ultimate way to enjoy any pda I switched from my iphone and i'm never turning back!; I use the phone all day every day so i wear out the battery just before bed time
Excellent sense UI to customize to ones liking. Size and feel of the device, feels great in hand. Android market loaded with a lot of free applications. Great call quality and expandable storage up to 32gb.; Battery life
*Feature packed with plenty to do. *Good call quality and reception. *Now can run Android 2.1, which improves the phone in many aspects; *Battery life can use some improvement. *On screen keyboard cannot keep up with fast typing. *The phone will lag or temporarily freeze when ending a phone call
1. Sleek, firm feel - not "plasticky". 2. Highly customizable interface, but not as fun as WebOS and its "cards". 3. Sprint TV plays nicely. 4. Access to Android Market and its 8000 apps. 5. Sprint service and free navigation!; 1.Prob won't sink w/ iTunes. 2.The youtube app doesn't have a "search" option. 3.Adjusting to the virtual keyboard. I didn't see any autocorrect like in the iphone. However, I'd rather play w/ this virtual keyboard than the cramped Pre Qwerty keyboard.
The screen looks great, the operating system is really cool and customizable. The camera is a lot better than I expected. The social network integration is also a really nice touch.; It is a little tricky to use for the first hour or two. The on screen keyboard is a little weird to get used to.
The phone is small, fitting nicely in both the hand and pocket. It sports a nice and shiny UI. The Android Market is also a huge plus. Audio quality is excellent through both the 3.5 mm jack and stereo Bluetooth. Expandable memory is appreciated.; Battery life could be better. The phone is very occasionally laggy. HTC only includes sync software for Windows. Increased internal storage would be welcome.
The camera quality is wonderful! There are lots of FREE apps in the android market. This is my first touch screen phone &#38; it was so easy to figure out.; Back of the phone is hard to get off. If you need to take the battery out it is hard to do.
-Phone quality sound and speaker,. -smallish,. -battery is pretty good for this type of device(computer with phone). -very customizable,. -easy to use. -voice recognition. -multi touch (pinch/pull zoom). -can change the SD card without pulling battery.; -no dedicated camera button.. -Needs more RAM memory for running apps.. -would rather a proximate sensor,. -would like a task panel for turning off apps (all androids are like this)
*HTC Sense UI is pretty slick, you get 7 screens instead of 3. *Android OS is the future (imo). *Access to growing Android App market. * Improved performance if you root it (though this can be risky as well).; *Battery life is not the greatest. *There are still errors/bugs that need to be worked out with Android, although I'm sure this will come with time.
Good clarity &#38; color, bright screen. Excellent for handling documents on the move.. Decent battery life - very cool feature with MS Active Sync allows the phone to double as a modem for your laptop - anywhere internet; Screen has been replaced twice because it began to de-laminate; make sure you spend the $$ for insurance.. Speaker phone is weak
All of these consumer reviews are bogus. The ones that are compairing it to other Android devices are inaccurate since this device has its own UI that is unique to the Sprint Hero phone.; If CNET chooses to remain a credible site for CE reviews, they need to either remove reviews on devices that are not released yet or disable the consumer review section until the device has been released.
I do not own the phone yet, but to see CNET lower it's rating due to the release of another phone makes NO sense what-so-ever! Rate the phone based on the phone alone, not because another phone was released. That's ridiculous!; Clearly you can see that CNET's rating is now below the user rating of 4 stars and well below the ratings of Sprint Customers at 4.6 stars. This rating decrease is pathetic.
the phone is very customizable&#38; easily syncs contacts.&#38; has so many useful features such as google voice search 4 the web, ability 2 make anything audible a ringtone, easy organization of programs etc.easy 2 use.sound is clear 4 calls&#38; song pl; the battery life could be a little longer. a little over 10 hours on 1 charge &#38; moderate usage. the flash player from the web doesn't always play on the phone. &#38; no flash on the camera.
Very sturdy, weight in my palm feels evenly distributed without hollow points. Switched from a Blackberry Pearl, in which the trackball died after 14 months. Overall sleek and smaller than you would first imagine.; Startup form complete power off is very long, in addition the application loading has something to be desired of, but I am very confident with a few patch deployments the latter complaint should be rectified.
Not an iphone. great touch screen control. alot of options to make it your own personal device. so many great apps free. best wifi connection on a mobile device that I have tried yet; short battery life get the car charger to go with it
I found this phone to be full of features and highly customizable! I'm a competer tech so I can't imagine what more the average person would want in a cellphone.; I have experienced occassional sluggishness. It could use a flash for the 5 megapixel camera.
- Phone is very responsive (no lag). - Highly customizable screens (Sense UI and widgets). - Touch screen is very accurate. - Email synchronization (POP/IMAP/Exchange) is easy to setup. - App store has uncountable downloads to enhance the phone; - Battery life is OK, but can be greatly improved with some tweaking. - Pre-installed apps can not be uninstalled (e.a. Amazon MP3). - microSD card slot is not readily available (under battery cover). - Speaker volume could be louder
User friendly for people like me; not tech savvy. still does almost what iphone does for a lot less money. I pay 3 phones svc for less than $150 a month includ. unlimited everything; text, internet, Sprint TV, GPS, minutes, etc.; Keyboard is hard to get used to. Lots of typos at the first. It took me 3 months and finally got the hang of it horizontally.
Great size for those who don't want 4.3 inch evo screen. Good battery life. And 2.1 is great on this phone. Build quality is superb and the glass screen feels like glass unlike the evo which actually feels like plastic.; Need to download a task killer or the phone can get slow Wish screen was 3.5 in.
It has been a Great Phone and PC for what I am looking for in a smart phone. Internet and email fast and easy. I am a Happy Sprint user for years and I like how this works on the network.; I don't have any but know when the Nexus One comes to Sprint I will want that upgrade for sure just for I know it will be even better.
Phone looks and feels great. Android is awesome, lots of free useful apps. Sense looks sharp. Call quality and speaker phone are very good.; Battery life is a boomer. The camera is good for a cell phone but it still sucks. Cell phones cameras are still light years from a decent digital camera. Calendar and contacts Google/outlook sync is bad.
Responsive Interface, Ive had the phone about a week and haven't had to reset it at all. Learning curve from Windows OS phones is Smooth in transition. Haven't experienced a lot of so called lag.Phone is Sleek And an attractive buy. Better Battery.; Phone Ships With Nothing,. Lack of Extra battery availability. No integrated carrying case. Not even a belt clip. Screen gets smudged to death
-Amazing on screen keyboard (rarely ever have any typos). -The screen itself is crisp and vibrant and looks loads better then the iPhone's.. -Sense UI from HTC in general is great.. -Android = great customization of your phone.. -Battery life great.; -Because of the hardware you can suffer from serious bog down.. -Be careful of not running too many apps (download a task manager)
Love the phone. Nothing bad to report. Does everything I could want, and so much more, fore a very reasonable monthly fee.; The only negative is this website and their journalistic integrity. Their editor's note of lowering the score because a new phone came out is pretty ludicrous and just funny. Why not lower the score of every phone every time a new one comes out.
Very customizable phone. Seems pretty quick. Can upload tv shows or movies fast. Great Sound Quality. Excellent GPS (and on sprint you don't pay an extra $10 a month for the darn thing) nearly as good as any Garmin. The lag cnet mentions is gone; Really haven't found any. With soooooooo many options it takes a bit to get used to, but it is just brilliant. maybe battery drainage while watching movies, tv or surfing the internet. otherwise, keyboard I wasn't used to, but calibration fixes it
Best Android-based phone I've seen?. (see summary for Pros); Price (relatively cheap @ $179 w/contract, but that's rich for me :). Volume buttons on left side are too big; easy to inadvertently push them.. Battery is good but if you use alot of the web &#38; multimedia features, it can slurp down the power in a day.
Easy to use, smooth function, Great Apps for just about anything you need and than some. Call clarity is great. All of the Apps- work great. A must for anyone who is lookig for a phone that does a lot.; To be honest I can not find any!
Battery life is great. Very customizable, i had a suite of programs I would use on my windows phones to make it they way I want it. This does what i want and more out of the box.; None really...but i would like it even more customizable
How smooth sense UI makes each interaction &#38; syncs all aspects of the phone, ex. uses Facebook to automatically update my contacts ID photo, birthdates, photo albums, etc. voice to Google search, accelerometer, multi touch features, light sensor; Think about it, you can always find a negative to something, with that being said, I would love to have flash with my camera, ummm, and I wish the price of the phone was only $2 although it?s worth every penny sprint charges.
- The updated firmware and multitude of features really make this phone a steal (be careful as older reviews about sluggish performance are now obsolete). - Thin yet solid. - Great for GMail and Google users. - Easy to personalize. - Clear sound quality; - If you must have a physical keyboard this isn't the phone for you. - If you must have iTunes of course there are better alternatives, but you can easily load up the SD card with your songs.
Comes with nice applications and the 3G network is very responsive.; Battery life. Thankfully with couple of apps from the market is an easy fix and you can get some decent battery life but you still may wanna carry your USB cable just in case. Media player not so good as in iPhone.
Amazing customization.. App market full of truly useful apps, unlike the pages of endless garbage available on iPhone.. Very responsive. Far quicker than my iPhone.. Text prediction works great.. Good call quality.. Google voice integration is awesome.; Battery life has been a slight issue for me, but mainly because I can't seem to quit messing with it. I'm always doing something with it.. Camera is a little sluggish between shots.. Really can't think of anything else.
loaded with great features; wonderful screen; more customizable than the iphone; call quality is very high - crystal clear, too; nice solid feel to this phone...like the fact that I can use a micro sd card; after a couple days use, I think the iphones keyboard is easier to use - maybe its because I've been using it in portrait mode and the keys seem too small compared to the iphones keys, but i'll check back after using the keys in landscape mode
customizing is very nice, great camera, voice guided navigation, numerous apps. i switched from at&#38;t iphone to sprint and the hero and at first wasnt feeling it was as near as good a phone, but now i wouldnt trade back, sprints anything deal is great; short battery life, software designers 6 months behind iphone apps, have to store apps on internal memory instead of the sd card.
I love the look and feel of this phone. The app market has so many choices and the different programs all run so smoothly on this phone. The touchscreen is very user friendly and easier to use than I thought it would be. Good job HTC and Google!; The camera is a very nice 5 MP, but I wish it could take a pic faster than it does.
Love the phone. Love the customization. good size for pocket. Looks nice and works well. Speaker phone aint bad. Others think it is cool.; Only issue is when i do the screen that shows all home screens on one, sometimes i select one and it doesnt activate. no biggie. Would prob move the Home button to center of bottom and ditch the track ball. Rarely use it and gets in way a little.
Intuitive controls, interface, applications and ease of use.. I love this phone so far, and it is by far the best one ive purchased.; Not many problems to mention, sometimes i wonder if im actually logged out of web pages or apps when i hit the home button..because you cant tell for sure. However I hear there is an app to kill any app you dont want running...so ill give it a try.
Sense UI. SD Card. Volume is extremely loud ( I can always distinguish and hear my phone ). Look and feel of the phone( Solid but beautiful). Extremely Responsive Touch screen. Extremely Customizable. Android Phone. 5.0 Megapixel Camera; Even the having a hero is great here are some of its cons :. 512 Mb of memory. Battery Life ( its not the worst battery but if you talk and use all the features of the phone it will definitely di
love the style of the phone and the shape of it and love how it is very slick. its light weight and the touch screen is unbelieve able not like my verizon lg env touch. i actually dropped my contract and the env touch to get this great phone.; no real cons just the battery can be better and also hate that the apps get saved to the actual phone memory. makes the phone sluggish but besides that great great phone.
Love the interface, the form factor, and the customizability of the whole thing. Visual voicemail is superb, as is integration with email and outlook EAS. Call quality is excellent and sound into your ear is clear and 'warm' sounding, not tinny.; doesn't close down apps so phone can become sluggish, you must run taskkiller all the time, must reboot phone every +-3 days to keep it fast, mute button is burried under a menu key, some things not intuative or easy to setup...see more in summary
The speed of this phone is great compared to my Treo 700p. I like the ability to get apps and the ease of moving between screens. The gps work well and so does the e-mail.; The calendar is a little hard to use. I liked the Palm better. Also the screen keyboard takes some getting used to. However after I calibrated it the typing is much better. It has locked up on me once.
The smooth interface and the app store rocks. I find that this phone has soo much to offer. I work with a few people who have iPhones and they even like this phone.; I'm not a fan of the way the actual phones works, if your on the phone with someone long enough for the screen to blank out then you have to push the power button and then unlock the phone to hang up. The phone is not rooted.
I luv the on screen keyboard it takes a little getting used to after the pre but i can't complain. the phone is sturdy and sleek with a very solid design. I only had the phone for three days and i luv it so far.; cons so far i do not like the is the battery power but other than that so far i haven't found any other flaws
Very fast, very sleek and out performs the IPhone hands down (and yes, I've owned both). There are MANY apps available, most of them free. This phone is very user friendly; This phone can be your favorite phone, or you can hate it. The reason that I say this is, it does freeze up.....UNLESS you go to the app. store and download the Advanced app killer. It's expandable to 32gb with a micro sdhc card.
E-mail works great and show up about 20 secs after I truly receive the e-mail for me (astounding time) Calendar is synced with Outlook and Google Calendar for my business and personal life. Several apps at once, unlike iPhone only able to run 1 app.; Battery life last me from 7:00am to 6:00pm... this is with a full day of app using, texting, calls, emails, web browsing and setting calendar dates. Doesn't bother me because my work day ends at 5:00pm and I am home by the time this phone runs out.
The Andriod os makes for an enjoyable experience. I spend about a quarter of my day finding new apps i can use on the Market. I had to decide between a couple phones: TP2 Tour or the Hero and was happy that i chose the Hero. PS:THE CAMERA IS AMAZING!; If all the features are left on (GPS, E-mail pushing, facebook refresher, etc.) then the battery can be okay in my opinion, bad in others. But if you turn off those features and use them when you need them, the battery is great.
I love how the phone is feels solid in the palms, very touch sensitive, responsive. I also like how it pulls contact information from Facebook and Twitter. This is a very good phone for the social networking people/business oriented.; Sluggish on the browser, texting in landscape with text prediction and auto correction is super sluggish, but great when text prediction and auto correction is off. Zooming in and out on the browser isnt very smooth, lack of saving apps to sd card.
I love the scenes! The apps rock. Love the screen size. Love that I can have tv, music, pictures, weather channel, internet and more! Track ball is cool. 5.0 megapixel camera is much better than my 2.0 camera on the phone I had before.; I wish it had a better keyboard because the virtual one is hard to use. The sync between computer and device could be better. No flash on camera. Battery needs improvement, it goes quick with heavy use.
It is highly customizable. I do not regret waiting for this phone. I also do not envy those Droid users our there, as the HTC Hero is by far a much better competitor than any Motorola, even one packed with juicy technology upgrades. Hero still wins; It would be nice ot have Android 2.0, but that will be here soon hopefully. It does have a smaller battery life and can drain quickly, but with a bit of customization, stay away from the OEM messaging system (use Handcent), and you'll be fine.
What don't I like about this phone? It is a great phone. This is my first Android phone and it runs great. It's not too big or bulky. Fairly comfortable to carry in my pocket.; It can be a little slugish at times but not nearly as bad as other reviews have said. The battery does go pretty quickly, but I downloaded an app killer app which helps the problem tremendously.
The Hero is real easy to use, it replaced my blackberry Tour that had POOR reception. This phone has very good reception. I like the Apps and the feel of the phone, it is a good option if you want and IPhone but you are not with AT&#38;T.; The only down side to the phone is that the battery is weak. You may need to tweak it to get more life from the battery
