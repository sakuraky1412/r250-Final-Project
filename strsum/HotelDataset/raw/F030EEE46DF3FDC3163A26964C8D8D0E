upon my arrival at the hotel room , i noticed long black hairs in bathroom sink , ants on the bathroom floor .
then i noticed pubic black hairs in the bed !
i am not black haired , so they were not mine and it was obvious the room had not been 'cleaned ' as they keep referring to it as .
when the cleaners say 'clean ' all they meant was to replace towels and toilet roll , bed sheets ( even that did not get done for my arrival ) ! !
so , i was very perturbed and felt ill at -ease with the dirty room !
i was not allowed to bring any native person to my room at all , even though i had paid up full and i was always a pleasant guest and i never complained for anything .
the customer service level was poor and slow .
they only offer one type of tea , despite advertising 5 other flavours on the menu .
the overall experience here was just adequate but i would not stay again due to the limits i encountered with stubborn hotel policies .
the bathroom has no drainage system for the shower water to go down and so its a real inconvenience , as then the bedroom floor gets wet and dangerous too !
the prices for things like food , drinks and tourist trips were excellent , and i thought the selection of jordanian /middle eastern food was good value , and enjoyable !

the location was ideal for ancient roman remains exploration and the overall downtown experience was good for me.
