there were a few other similar experiences i encountered during my stay so i decided to check out a day early , it just was not worth the aggravation !
if one of the hotel owners reads this review my top three suggestions would be ( 1 ) fix the customer service issues , ( 2 ) update the hotel immediately to include good quality beds , new carpet and internet service ( 3 ) lower your prices until you have completed # 1 and # 2 !
because cell service and wireless is an issue ( as confirmed in previous reviews ) , having no phone or internet service in the rooms and inside the hotel was a problem .
if you do stay in an ocean front room to the far right or far left you will not have privacy as the balcony next to you extends out allowing your neighbors to see right into your room the entire hotel is old and stuffy .
on the day i arrived they only had one bartender that was responsible for taking orders and managing the pool area .
i do have to say that the concierge team was very friendly and helpful .
one front desk manager indicated that there were newer , firmer beds available and would look into moving me to a different room .
there were a few issues i encountered when i arrived including a very old wavy , soft , uncomfortable mattress and a phone that did n't work .
turns out that three of the front desk managers had absolutely no clue if there were newer mattresses .
so i suppose it 's my fault for not taking into consideration the negative reviews because they were accurate .
