the playstation 2 is really the best console from 2000    2006  .
this mighty console has had most 3rd party support , meaning they got the most games  .
the console has gotten mostly every major franchise in one way or another  .
the only con is that the online play is somewhat lacking compared to that of xbox live  .
the console is well planned and is one of the greatest consoles ever  .
20 years from now we will look at this console and compare it to the greatness of the nes .
considering the consumer backlash over the wii , the ps format is affordable quality  .
games for kids and dad  .
we're sending back our wii controllers , feb 4 and still cannot get a console , and upgrading to a ps2  .
alright , before i review ps2 , i'm not a huge supporter of sony in any way (i usually stick with panasonic , rca/ge , or pioneer for electronics)  .
i own and play nes , snes , sega genesis , sega saturn , sega dreamcast , playstation , playstation 2 , xbox , nintendo 64 , gamecube , and tomorrow i'll be getting the xbox 360  .
with that said , i'll get on with the review i is one of the lucky people to buy my first ps2 on october 26 , 2000  .
i remember it very well because it is my first year of high school and i my first job that year  .
i ended up buying the system with timesplitters and midnight club street racing with 2 months of paychecks  .
since then , i've accumulated 25 games and gone through 4 systems i'll admit , first run of the systems had their flaws (i remember that i had to reset the system to switch from dvd to cd games)  .
but they have definetly improved in quality  .
the first ps2 bought , i played the hell out of it  .
i also used it as my main dvd player (dvd players were expensive back then)  .
after 2 and a half years , i could barely get it to work  .
so i gave it away and bought a brand new one  .
i also owned 2 systems of the redesigned consoles  .
they're smaller , but they tend to overheat  .
also , the way the newer one has a flip top seems kind of cheap and would break over time  .
i would definetly go with the older system if you can find one in great shape , or brand new somewhere  .
i ended up buying a used old ps2 that is in great shape to replace the newly designed ones anyways , the graphics started off decent (just like every other every system) , but they have definetly gotten better over the years  .
back then , it is hard to believe that you would see nice graphics on a game like gran turismo 4 killzone when the system launched with only games like midnight club or smugglers run  .
i wouldn't say that the graphics are better than xbox or gamecube , but the graphics are great either way there has to be atleast 500 games to choose from now  .
there are rpg's , action , first person shooters , racing games , classic collections , fighting games , kiddie games , adventure , crime simulation , flying games , sports games , and rts games  .
like i said , there's many games to choose from  .
my personal favorite games include the gran turismo series , need for speed   hot pursuit 2 , metal gear solid series , midway arcade treasures series , dynasty warrior series , soul calibur series , killzone , gta series , midnight club series , timesplitters series , capcom classics , atv offroad fury series , god of war , simpsons hit and run , and many other great games to choose from regarding the newer console generation , i honestly would like to see how ps3 does before i spend money on it  .
the way sony is going with the ps3 , it could really go either way  .
xbox 360 won't live up to it's real potential for another 2    3 years atleast  .
the nintendo wii looks great , but it might not be for everybody  .
with that said , i can see ps2 lasting atleast another 3    4 years before sony stops supporting for it  .
ps3 costs alot to make (bluray , enough said) and they have to fix their losses somehow  .
ps2 can be a way to get them back on track in conclusion , ps2 is one of the best systems i've ever played  .
it's easily the best console of this generation  .
i would reccommend it to anyone who plays videogames and does not own one yet ps    i know i gave it a 10  .
to me the , ps2 is perfect  .
but if you look at any system , old or new , you will find flaws somewhere  .
plus , i want to help even out the moronic and extemely biased reviews .
ps2 rules the world  .
come on , this is the best gaming console ever for now anyways  .
large variety of games , awesome graphics , and a dvd player  .
awesome , just awesome .
i hate when people say xbox is better then ps2 cause it ain't  .
first off people forget the ps2 put dvd's on the map , yes dvd's would have eventually been where it is today day but would have taken alot longer  .
ps2 has a big user base , so a dvd player is in almost every household thanks to ps2's dvd playback function another thing people forget when they compare graphics is that the ps2 is made to go against the dreamcast which is the only next generation system out at the time  .
sony didn't know about the xbox specs , so how your gonna slam sony for something that they had no control over  .
the ps2 is backwards compatible which you can play all the classic ps1 games on it also it's a fact that xbox 2 won't have backwards compatibility , so if you want to play halo or halo 2 you need your old xbox  .
xbox has a hard drive but it took developers a while before they used it for something other then game saves  .
it's also a fact that by micorsoft putting the hard drive they lost millions of dollars on xbox another thing is that ps2 has all the best exclusive games while xbox has a few multiplatform games and halo where else can you play gta (first) , gran turismo , god of war game and also soul calibur 3  .
the last game on that list is a good example , soul calibur 2 came out on ps2 , xbox and gamecube , the reason why soul calibur 3 is a ps2 exclusive is because the other 2 systems didn't provide enough sales for it  .
everyone on xbox is just playing halo 2 and gamecube is a kiddie system xbox may have the better online service but you know what they charge for it and when the ps3 hits and has a new and improved online service for free everyone will hop to ps3  .
my point is the ps2 is a 10 not in graphics but in games and that's what counts  .
xbox can have halo but tell me what there gonna do when there's no more halo , they'll fall  .
you can ask any game reviewer and any real gamer and they will tell you the only thing keeping xbox afloat is halo so guys and gals don't get an xbox because it has better graphics but instead look at it's games and gameplay and you'll see there's nothing there  .
the ps2 is on top because of great games even though it does not have the power of a pc (xbox)  .
the fact is that xbox with all it's power is never able to top an inferior system , not because sony had a year jump (remember dreamcast had a 2 year jump and fell to ps2) but because it's the best gaming platform .
the non    slim design really does not change much  .
great console had it then stupidly sold it really want it back   \  .
very good games and a very good value  .
the most popular video game console ever made with over 115 , 000 , 000 (115 million) sales worldwide  .
system has a great selection of games and uses memory sticks so you can easily take one out and go to your friends house to play  .
no wireless headsets are supported for online play , only corded , usb headsets are  .
expansion bay will let you use a 40 gb hdd  .
system may also be used to run linux software but is rare overall this video game console is simple but highly upgradeable .
u can get a complete ps2 console , with 2 controllers , a memory card , a few games , a monster s video cable and even a carrying case for less than one hundred bucks  .

top of the line greatest baby  .
the playstation 2 console is ultmately the best console out with the addition of the slimline version this version lacks the network adapter  .
has huge game library .
i love this system , and as a bonus i connected it to a projecter for even more fun  .
but when playing ddr it sometimes freezes which is annoying because i play for hours at a time with my freinds and lose all my progress  .
any suggestions from all u ps2 users out there  .
playstation 2 is definitely the winner of this generation's console war  .
it has sold the most , is the most popular , and has the best third    party support  .
some people might view things differently and say that the xbox is , but the general audience has picked sony's playstation 2 to be the best  .
with a playstation 2 you don't have to buy a kit to play dvds , get a huge choice of games to play , and most of your friends with consoles have one  .
sure , the graphics are better with the xbox and it has more hard    drive  .
but graphics aren't everything and you really don't need all that hard    drive space  .
an 8mb graphics works fine  .
i have 12 games , and i have not even filled half of a card yet  .
plus , i have a friend who has an xbox , after one week of playing it , it started freezing and malfunctioned  .
my ps2 has never failed me before after five years of use , and no matter what others think , stat    wise , playstation 2 is the sure    fire winner of this generation's console war .
i've had this baby for 5 years now and i still love it  .
i've bought other systems but sold them after using them for a while  .
but the ps2 is something you keep  .
i love the large game selection and it always gives me something to do  .
the only thing i do not like is that there is only 2 controller ports  .
i feel there should be more for playings with multiple friends .
the only people that constantly try to bring down the ps2 are halo/halo 2 nerds the ps2 has great graphics  .
the people that go around saying differently cannot tell the difference between the xbox graphics and the ps2 graphics  .
they only repeat what they've heard i think the ps2 is wonderful  .
i've never had a problem with mine  .
i use mine more as a dvd player than a gaming console each person will have their own opinion as to which is better (i do not even consider gamecube to be competition)  .
to each their own .
i have had the playstation 2 ever since the month after its release  .
i have never found anything wrong with it and i am always supplied with a fresh batch of games  .
i love the design of the controller which come in all varieties now  .
all of the games i have bought are still in great condition and so is the ps2 itself  .
memory size is about my only problem  .
memory cards only have 8 mb on them which limits the amount of saves  .
i have about 10 different memory cards for all of my games which gets confusing at times  .
most games only allow 2 players because of the only 2 controller slots  .
this is alright most of the time , except when you are playing with a bunch of other people  .
aside from the cons (of which have little effect on the gaming experience) this is a great system to own and it will provide entertainment for years to come .
i bought my playstation 2 when it first came out in 2001  .
i is the first to have one of these and like the many other numerous idiots out there decided i needed it right then and shelled out five hundred dollars at toys n joys (local shop) however i have not regretted the purchase although i is a little salty when the price went down to $300 in a few weeks then down to 199 and then dropping to only 149  .
being that i is in sixth grade when i bought it i did not really care about the graphics and what not but the ps2 is really an amazing machine  .
the processor is reasonably fast and provides graphics that are crisp and clear  .
the one i bought has not given me any trouble at all over the past four years and even the original controller has not broken even though it has been thrown many times (i am an angry person)  .
my ps2 has had a few problems playing a few of the earlier games like midnight club and smuglers run , but i suspect that this is just a first release glitch  .
i have also heard that the new slim ones overheat but really who cares  .
in this modern age 150 bucks is nothing , hell it wont even buy you a new cell phone , however this will provide you endless amounts of amusement and gaming for a sliver of the price you would pay for a high end gaming rig like an alx  .
the only thing i would tell any one to wait for is the new ps3 .
this is really good  .
i love it  .
i play it all the time  .
the new games are awsome  .
the only bad part is you have to buy multi    tap for the four player games , but there arnet many of those out there and it isnt very expensive anyway  .
you can play original play station 1 and play station games on it  .
it comes with a pretty comfortable controler  .
the dvd player is so cool  .
you only need a controler to play a movie and you do not have to buy anything for it , unlike xbox  .
this is an awsome product by far .
i have owned my ps2 since it is the new thing and i have never regreted it  .
the graphics , while not as good as the xbox , are still quite amazing , especially in final fantasy games  .
the gaming library for the ps2 is outstanding (i've sunk 140 hours into dark cloud 2) and i've watched many a dvd movie on it  .
minorly annoying is needing the multitap for games with lots of players  .
also if you like online play you will need the internet adapter but on the new slim ps2 this is included so it's not really a problem  .
so , if you do not already own a ps2 , go out and get a slim ps2 and enjoy the cheaper price (around 150) and ethernet adapter and get to playing those great games  .
i know many friends that have xbox's but i'm more than happy with my ps2 and i highly recommend it .
$149  .
99 is not exactly chump change , but this is one system that will go places  .
for those of you who say the x    box has better graphics overall , which it does , remember that the ps2 is released 1 year earlier  .
like the controller and how familiar it is  .
(if it ain't broken do not fix it , but do add some new stuff if needed) and , unlike the x    box , it can play dvds right out the box  .
still , dvd remote highly recommended  .
as for the 2 controller port part , not really much of an issue for me as i'm pretty much a loner  .
overall , get it  .
graphics are still solid , as proven by games like mgs3 .
the ps2 is most definitly not the most powerful video game system out , nor does it have the best graphics , it simply has the best games  .
devil may cry 3 , grand theft auto  san adreas , metal gear solid 3 , kingdom hearts 2 , grand turismo 4 , are just to name a few must have titles for the system  .
not to mention the must have classics that u can now by for $20 dollars or cheaper  .
xbox has the power and online ability  .
gamecube has mario , metriod , resident evil and zelda (which are must haves also)  .
i love all 3 systems equally because all are great in their on way but , if i had to choose one , it would have to be the ps2 because it games are the games i play the most .
great system when i bought it and the kids and me still use to this day i'll get one of the new ones , ps3 , xbox360 or wii once the prices come down a little more , but until then , this still gets the job done .
i loved my ps2 while it worked but after years of use it gave out on me  .
it worked great for a while and i certainly got my money's worth  .
the ps2 controller is the best layout ever the contoller is what i miss the most .
ps2 is a a must have next gen console , featuring some classic titles and great single player experiences  .
however , there are alot of add ons that you need to purchase such as memory card for 15$ , multitap to enable 4 player for 30 to 50$ , brodaband live thinggy that enables live for 30$ , and depending on how many play at once almost 3 extra controlers for 30$ each  .
that adds up to around 300$ for the full system equiped to the max , it has many redimable features like the fantastic audio and great game selection almost over 500 different games for it  .
the built in dvd player helps alot for the movie lovers and can save the troulbe of having to buy a dvd player  .
so you may save 200$ easy  .
overall the system is classic and a must have  .
sony once again offers a great console that has the full package  .
the playstation 2 has a phenominal lineup of games that are bound to appeal to any gamer , core of mainstream  .
it offers many multimedia features along with online support , but these features just are not as well done as microsoft's xbox , which seemingly trumps all the ps2's features  .
but despite some harware issues , there is no doubt the playstation 2 will provide you with endless entertainment , which is what it's for .
hey grab a ps2 for better games than xbox  .
great , one of my favorite gaming consoles .
i'm buying an xbox to play games against my friends online since they all have one  .
otherwise it would not be worthwhile to switch to the xbox , and even then i'm still keeping my ps2  .
also like the look and ui of the xbox games better .
the ps2 , though not the console with the best hardware capabilities , it bring me countless hours of fun gaming time with the large amounts of games  .
metal gear solid series , devil may cry series , ace combat series , and those are just the few  .
when i got the ps2 , it is priced at $199  .
99 cdn , so the price is fair in my opinion  .
all in all , it's a good console  .
in fact , recently ps2 has sold over 120 million units world wide , pretty good achievement in my view .
when i want to by a game system , that is what i want  .
not something that can play dvd's , music , and something that can esentially become a mini computer  .
now thats not saying that it cannot play games , oh no this is an amazing gaming system with tons of games to choose from , but it's just a little bit computer    like  .
after one hour of playing the ps2 scratches valuable discs .
this is a bad system in terms of power , quality , and graphics .
i bought a sony playstation and it broke after only one year's use  .
i bought a sony ps2 and it broke after only 6 months  .
i have to send the console back to them to be repaired under the 1 year warranty and on top of it , i have to pay for the shipping charges  .
i'm sorry , but that is not a good product by anyone's standards  .
i should have stuck with the microsoft xbox .
im already on my fifth ps2 , all the other broke whithin a month and i do not know why i even bothered and when i sold my last one my room felt much lighter and more calm like some sort of evil presence had left the building .
hey dont buy this thing , it doesnt read ps2 disks and scratches new disks  .
so much for over 150  .
it murdered the dreamcast , so i hate it  .
this is just a traball system with a horibble lag , not much online suport as xbox , crappy know a lot of people who had to take theres back to get it repaird cause the dvd drive is a piece of junk  .
after a year with this garbage i gave it to my little brother an he still perfers the xbox over this anyday  .
great games. has the most support from game developers.; weakest graphics.
The controller was second to none; It died on me but I played it to death
Games, controller everything about it; nothing can be found with this system
value, games, simplicity; i guess the controller is merely mediocre?
wait to find the right deal on the internet; none - just dont pay more than a hundred
Huge Game selection, DVD Player, Controller easy to use; A little bit too computer-like, only two controller slots
Great game selection, great controller configuration, serves as dvd player; A bit bulky, graphically weaker than Xbox
Lots of good games to choose from; Consoles are unreliable
Fully Backwards compatible, plays dvds, awesome third party support.; only two controller slots, graphics aren't great compared to xbox's.
Great Selection of Games, only 2 contoller slots (if you like it); only 2 controller slots (if you hate it)
good controls,slightly smaller than the Xbox, more games; does not have a hard drive (but u can buy one on tha internet)
Great graphics, sleek, goodlooking, plays dvds, large selection of games; None in my book
Design, games, large collection of games; Low power, low quality, poor games except some, poor graphics, and many more...
massive amount of games; not the graphics power house from that generation.
Best Games, Great Controlles, Sleek Design, Online Play; Online Play, Weakest of the 3,
Great selection of games, reliable; not enough controller ports
Huge library of games, exclusives, the best period; Other than the online service it's perfect
Affordable Fun, good mix of available games.; Have to spend more time with the Kids.
dvd player, great new games, plays old games as well. Great controler; you have to buy multi-tap to play 4-player games
Loads of games, nice looks, DVD right out of the box, nice controller, backward compatibility (PS1), USB and Firewire, last true 128 bit system, CD/DVD tray, and price.; Reliability(the first generation systems), doesn't come with memory card, newer ones don't support the horizontal stand,.
Largest library of games, huge 3rd party support, DVD features right out the box, familiar controller; being the oldest means that X-Box and Gamecube have better graphics, heavily criticized for being released 1st
hundreds of games to choose from, great graphics, games for anyone, great controllers, dvd playback, reliable system; no hard drive, online gaming isn't the greatest
Doesn't freeze up like most games on PCs. Tons of games, games are cheap compared to new systems.; No built in memory and limited ability to save games, user interface for saving/editing games and info is not intuitive,
Now is cheap at $150 and still for sale by SONY, a massive selection of great games, memory sticks allow you to quickly get your memory stick, expansion bay allows for 40 GB HDD, built in DVD player.; Only supports up to 480i, needs an external online adaptor, disc tray might scratch reading lens.
Availability of various types of games keeps my girlfriend and I happy even though our gaming selection is very different. Sturdy (going on at least 3yrs) and doubles as a DVD player for me.; Games seem bland after playing the Xbox. Online gaming behaves like an add-on function rather than integrated like the Xbox.
amazing lineup of games; has best means of control; sleek design; backed by great marketing; very popular; appeals to every audience; online play; multimedia features; backward compatible; Hardware not very well built; visuals not on par with Xbox; hard to develop games for; supports only two players; online play not as good as Xbox's service;
Superb graphics, very sexy, nearly unlimited amounts of games and accessories, best controller design in the business, Sony reliability, multimedia compatibility, dvd support, online gaming; difficulty playing some games that were first released, graphics slightly less good than the xbox, no hard drive
Great games with good audio, ok live abilities, DVD player built in; the graphics on the games seem to be 50 50, not all games are great, alot of needed accsesories to get full experience
