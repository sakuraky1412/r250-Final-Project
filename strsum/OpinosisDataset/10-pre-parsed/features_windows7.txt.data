it's loaded with useful features .

smooth os with great little features .

it does have some nice features .

they're features i don't use .

,  many features are copied from mac os x

,  new features with better window and file managment

also in windows explorer, two new features .

runs well, but no stand out new features for my usage .

seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .

and i love all the new aero shake peek snap windows features, but i still prefer mac os x's expose .
