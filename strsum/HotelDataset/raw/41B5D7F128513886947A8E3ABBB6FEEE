we stayed here the night before visiting the george w bush presidential library and museum the next morning .
it is a nice property just across the freeway from smu 's main campus and is a quick , less than 5 minute drive to the museum .
there is free parking but the lot is spread out around the hotel and your spot may not be close to the lobby entrance .
the lobby is impressive and we were welcomed by a friendly , efficient fornt desk and a variety of freshly baked cookies along with choice of skin or whole milk .
i must confess that my daughter and i made a second trip down to the front desk before going to bed that night . . .
the room was decorated in a nice modern style with comfortable beds , normal sized pillows ( too many properties give you a pile of squarish pillows that are uncomfortably thick ) and nicely designed reading lights attached to the headboards .
there was a nice , large chair in the corner of the room that had a tray for snacks or a meal attached to it .
in the bathroom , shampoo , conditioner and lotion were generously sized - a nice touch .
breakfast was great .
first , the area to eat is huge with a variety of seating options .
there were several hot serving areas with choice of scrambled eggs , scrambled eggs with cheese , bacon , biscuits with gravy , breakfast potatoes , oatmeal , yogurt , muffins , toast and bagels ( with toaster . . .
