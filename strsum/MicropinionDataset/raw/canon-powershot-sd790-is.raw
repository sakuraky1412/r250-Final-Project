Cons:. asoulutley NOTHING!. 
Summary:. greatest point-and-shoot camera !!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. good size, great point and shoot, love all the features, good clear pictures. 
Cons:. battery life. 
Summary:. I searched everywhere for a camera that i wanted and i fell apon this one and i loved everything i was hearing about it, the main reviews that were bad was about the battery life, and i agree with that. If you have children or pets this camera is great. Its good for all events if you want a picture taken right away. Also it works great in the dark and light. This is the best best best little camera. i would recommend it to anyone. I bought mine refurbished and i still dont have any complaints!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic pictures, easy to use, and at a price point that is an outstanding value.. 
Cons:. Selector wheel has a sensitivity learning curve, but can be mastered quickly.. 
Summary:. This is a great point and shoot camera. In full auto mode the SD790IS takes outstanding images for the price.. What I was looking for in a digital camera:. Ease of use, sub 200 dollar price, and fantastic picture quality.. Why:. My last camera was a Nikon Coolpix 5700, which captures great images in the right conditions (IMHO), but is intimidating to many people due to the less than intuitive layout/design/controls for non-SLR users. My significant other was intimidated by this camera and as a result I end up on the other side of the lens all the time and rarely appear in pictures with my family.. What I got in the SD790IS:. The Cannon SD790IS very easy to operate in auto mode. The price is right and the images are, IMHO, amazing for this price range. It destroyed the comparable Nikons.. Beyond meeting all my initial criteria, the SD790IS has outstanding video and I have not experienced any problems with the placement of the microphone pinhole and wind noise, as suggested by the CNET review. The Color Accent feature is also interesting to play with.. Battery life is significant, though I purchased an additional battery for reserve when traveling out of country. Double AA battery cameras are great for this purpose, but the battery life of the SD790IS makes this a non-issue, at least for my purposes.. The display is big and beautiful, though I sometimes feel it is too forgiving with questionable images.. I thoroughly recommend this camera if it fits your needs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feature Rich. Easy to Use. Awesome Photo Quality. Tiny. 
Cons:. No View finder (had to nitpick). 
Summary:. I'm a point and shot kind of guy. I've used everything from high SLR to these little compact types. This is the easiest to use, takes a great photo, and meets my needs very well. I'd recommend this to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality, Easy to use, Big lcd. 
Cons:. Small memory card. 
Summary:. I have always been a big fan of the Canon Powershot series. The SD790IS is another great Canon camera in my opinion. So far all the pictures have turned out great. Camera seems like it is built/constructed very well. Very east to use controls. Button layout is a nice change in my opinion. Highly recommended !. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. Nothing at all. 

$$;
Pros:. Design, Price, quality of construction. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. Bought this camera hours before going to NYC and found it very easy to use and it took great pictures. We currently own to Sonys and after becoming frustrated with por pictures we decided to give Canon a chance. So far so good and for $179 at Costco a great deal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality. User interface doesn't make me want to melt my brain. The 3" screen is fairly reactive and is a good representative to what the picture will actually look like. Battery life is very good, especially since it's a rechargable. 
Cons:. the 32 MB SD card that comes with it is far beyond useless.. 
Summary:. I've been researching digital camera's for quite some time but couldn't quite make up my mind. But then my photographer buddy showed me what he uses when he isn't using pro cameras(like when he's on vacation). He had a SD750 and he loved the thing which brought me over to the Canon's.. I actually bought the SD790 thinking it was the 750 when I got it from Costco. Btw if you want a great price for these go to your local Costco. I couldn't be happier with the purchase.. The prices of SD cards are so cheap, just don't even think of having the pathetic 32MB as a con. Buy yourself whatever card size you think you need and be happy with the awesome quality of this camera. You won't regret it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I own 4 SD750s and am in the process of replacing junk Coolpix purchased for my family. The SD is so much faster, easier to use, better focus, better battery perf and has not broken down like 4 of my 8 Nikons with the same battery door failure.. 
Cons:. I wish I'd have chosen Canon from the start. I owned a few Canon AE1s but got caught up in the Nikon name which has caused me to waste thousands.. 
Summary:. Approx 1500 to 2200 photos per Canon so far- all loving family shots from across the country. Thanks Canon for making my family happy and able to share our family photos again. I'll be purchasing another 5 over the next couple of months. Thanks CNet for your accurate reviews and shopping assistance!!. PS- Not a griper but sent Nikon 4 cameras withy the same failure, battery door tabs broken, and they said not their problem. PErhaps nikon planned their name to anagram Nikon=NO KIN. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture clarity, quick refresh between shots. 
Cons:. Small buttons a bit difficult to use. 
Summary:. A really great camera. Just returned from 2 weeks in Seattle/Alaska. I am so pleased with the pictures - clear, balanced, no shake...all the things I need as an amateur photographer and parent on the move...highly recommend!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. picture quality is excellent. 
Cons:. i have no cons to report. 
Summary:. i upgraded from the SD550 canon there is not comparisent. The SD790IS far surpasses the SD550. I am very happy with my new SD790.. 

$$;
Pros:. Photo Quality, stlyish, LCD (3 inch). more than 300 shots in one charge. 
Cons:. Newbies found it difficult to operate the cam.. 
Summary:. Like this product due to unmatchable canon photo quality. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality, compactness, video quality, looks, screen, speed.. 
Cons:. The scroll wheel could be a little more accurate, I had a little trouble with my screen at first. 3x zoom is on the bottom end of optical zoom, but I don't mind.. 
Summary:. I bought this camera a couple months ago, and it has been really awesome. The pictures it takes are fantastic, and they have great quality. I love the angular look of the camera, and the video is amazing (the mic faces backwards, yet still gets all the sound. How is that possible?!). The big screen size is fantastic and doesn't seem to take a big hit off battery life. I have brightness maxed and rarely use flash, and get about 500+ shots per charge. As a little side-note: the picture files are pretty large (I shoot at the max quality), so I invested in an 8 GB SDHC card and get 1745 pictures before purging.. If you are wondering about the screen thing, I have put this camera through thick and thin (left in overnight in a 10-below 0 degrees F garage, dropped (in a small case), and it has been hit (through a 1/2 inch of neoprene...not much protection there), and I noticed some blue spots on my screen (not like dead pixels, but splotches). I brought it to best buy and the Geek Squad said it looked like moisture, but needless to say they sent it out to be repaired, free of charge (even though I bought the camera like 6 months ago). Decent service!. As for the scroll wheel, it also clicks in the four directions. It can be a little oversensitive but that is probably because I don't use the scroll wheel often vs. just pressing down in the four quadrants.. So overall, this camera is fantastic! Enjoy!. Updated. on Jun 5, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. very good quality, fast boot+shot and the rechargeable battery, i'm starting to think that never runs out.. 
Cons:. maybe that you have to bring out the battery everytime you need to recharge.. 

$$;
Pros:. good pictures, and Canon is the only digital camera still made in JAPAN!!!! it's solid!. 
Cons:. wheel has a sensitivity learning curve. 

$$;
Pros:. Full featured camera with many adjustable settings.. 
Cons:. None so far. 

$$;
Pros:. -Best Pics EVER, really sharp, and colors look very natural. -Very Simple to Use!l. -Video Quality not HD but surprisingly good. -Lots of features, and can control almost the slightest detail or just put on full auto!. 
Cons:. -Video control is bad. No optical zoom while recording. Video imaging bad in low light (can see lots of noise) and sound not the best.. -Scroll wheel is kool gimic and is easy to use but will over/under spin all the time.. -3x Optical zoom not enough!. 
Summary:. I just bought this camera and have been playing with it a few weeks now. I got is because it is soooooo cheep right now and cnet's great review of it.. So far, I haven't done anything serious with it yet but just take some pics of me and my friends during our music program and do some youtube videos. It is GREAT! I love almost every aspect of it! But video quality just kills it (note that if you want a camera for mainly video recording, you shouldn't even think about this camera and is not a video camera). When i record myself playing piano, it has a weird sound with it but normal recording is fine.. I'm about to go to Europe and can't wait to use this fully and take great pictures of landscape and castles.. BEST CAMERA FOR PRICE, USABILITY, AND PICTURE QUALITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. The camera is easy to use and takes great dark pictures when set to the evening setting. It has a great weight that feels well constructed. The large LCD works well for picture viewing. Snappy to when processing photos.. 
Cons:. The mic can stink when it is windy out. The buttons can be sorta hard to press.. 
Summary:. I am really happy with the operation of the camera. I am a point and shoot photographer and this fits the bill without hurting your pocket book. I would definitely recommend this camera to my friends.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is the best compact camera I have ever purchased. It has many features and excellent photo quality. It's very stylish and is also sturdy enough to survive drops.. 
Cons:. The scroll wheel is sometimes a little awkward to use, but for most selections you have the option of using it.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Great picture quality under adverse conditions. -Fast performance pic-to-pic without flash. -Durable - It's already survived a drop. -Simple, effective interface. -Image stab really works. -Lots of "fun" features. -Has manual mode. -Long battery life. 
Cons:. -Picture-to-picture performance extremely slow when flash is on. -No optical zoom when filming movies. -Doesn't charge with USB cable - power outlet require (can get a separate charger that utilizes USB). 
Summary:. I spent a lot of top shopping for cameras in the $200 range. I spent a lot of time reading reviews on multiple cameras and narrowed down the field to the SD790 IS, SD 1100 IS, and a Fujifilm FinePix 1000fd. I finally had to go to an electronics store to test them all out for myself.. The Fuji was nice, but unimpressive. After an hour of going back and forth between the 790 and the 1100, I chose the 790 for its much larger screen size (something that I have never really cared about). The image just looks so much clearer on the large screen.. I've been testing it for about a month now and I have been extremely impressed. I took it tunneling through a steam heating system and it came out on the other side fine, not to mention the pictures that it took in the dark were perfect.. I like the wide variety of "fun" features - I enjoy playing with them when bored.. My biggest complaint is the slow performance time when waiting for the flash to recharge. However, this seems to be the case with all point-and-shoot digitals in this price range.. Overall, it's a fantastic camera. I already have a few friends that have seen it and have since added it to their Christmas lists. I recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable digital camera. It's the best bang-for-your-buck you'll get in this price range.. 

$$;
Pros:. pictures are sharp and clear. they are best of same type of camera. video is clear with good sound.. 
Cons:. rotating wheel is hard to use, very annoy. also, 32MB SD card is a joke.. 
Summary:. this is my 5th digital camera. i have a canon SLR but not easy to carry around, esp. to catch outdoor pictures for kids. so i was looking for a easy point and shot camera. i did a careful reviewed and tested a few cameras, finally bought this one. I am very happy with my choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Better indoor shots than earlier versions, easy to use. 
Cons:. Rotating wheel to select modes is too loose and hard to use. 
Summary:. Forget megapixels and go for a camera w/ the features you need. All of these cameras have enough megapixels to print even big prints, and they all have tiny lenses that are incapable of performance beyond a certain point anyhow. I like this camera b/c of the big screen on the back and because it takes OK indoor pictures.. 

$$;
Pros:. small, fast, great picture quality.. 
Cons:. location of power button makes one handed operation prone to lens errors, and low light pictures are difficult to keep clear.. 
Summary:. Great camera. I carry it in my pocket all the time! Its fast and the battery life is awesome. I took over 600 pictures in 2 days and only had to recharge once.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stylish, easy to use, Image Stabilizer, huge 3" LCD. 
Cons:. Only 3x optical zoom, noisy at high ISO, no manual modes, pricey. 
Summary:. I choose this little camera because it is an ultra compact that is really easy to carry and to use, you can ask anyone to take a picture with excellent and consistent results. I loved the SD750 but I felt that the image stabilizer was missing.. The SD790IS is an all-metal (at least on the outside) camera. The 3" LCD is huge and superb for composing photos. I don't miss the optical viewfinder and I prefer to have this excellent screen than having a smaller 2.5" display with a tiny optical viewfinder.. I would like a manual mode, but the fully automatic exposure is pretty good as well as auto-focus. The face recognition is also both handy and accurate.. I feel the 3x zoom somewhat limited. The camera is noisy from ISO 200 and above (but it is not worst than any other competing ultra-compact camera) and yet the ISO 400 and even ISO 800 is good for smaller prints. At ISO 80 the resultas are very pleasant.. This little camera is more on the luxury look, feel and price, yet I think that the price is fair and the value for money is good.. All in all I am very happy with this camera and I take it with me all the time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well put together,. 
Cons:. No wi fi, 3 X ocptical. 
Summary:. This is the epitome of the ELPH class cameras. After owning this for some months it�"s my thought it does everything that is advertised. Remember this is only an ultra compact and not a full fledge take up a lot or room camera. It�"s perfect for traveling. At first the click wheel seemed a little awkward but after a couple of weeks the click wheel loosened up a little and it became a pleasure to use, I also like the Razor buttons, (very stream line.). The picture quality is very good, and with the on board cropping, well that�"s just plain neat. 10 mega pixels, durable, it�"s a good choice. All the ELPHS are good cameras but I chose this one. The 3in screen sold me. In short, fantastic photos, well built, good looking, and fun to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Crisp clear photos, easy and fun to use. Fast startup.. 
Cons:. A trick carrying case would of been nice and a larger SD card.. 
Summary:. This is my second ELPH, the first one was purchased over 8 years ago, and the darn thing is still working. It was a 2 mega pixel. After this I bought a Nikon and a Casio. Now, a few weeks ago I decided to buy the Canon �SSD 790 IS�� and WOW, these cameras have come a long way. After weeks of experimenting with the different settings, indoor and outside, this has to be the slickest ELPH made so far. Once you get used to the click wheel, your off and running. It encourages you to use all the functions, and its fun also. The pictures are crystal clear and not at all soft. The start up time is amazingly quick; Push the power button and it�"s ready (Really fast). Put this beside one of the older ELPH cameras and the SD 790 IS quite a bit smaller. But it still retains the same quality stainless steel, held together with tiny screws, just like the original. And lastly the 3inch LCD display is bright and clear, together with the flush mounted buttons this is what the ELPH should be. Small, well built, and durable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Pics in Various Lighting Conditions, Face Detection, Motion Stabilizer, Fast Startup, Fast Shot-to-Shot Cycling, Excellent 3" Screen, Ability to use SDHC Cards, Logical Menu System. 
Cons:. Slightly Large Compared to Certain Models, Absence of Optical Viewfinder, Not Shockproof or Waterproof, No HD Video. 
Summary:. Not going to get into all the technical nitty-gritty...I'll leave that for other reviewers.. Overall, I did a ton of research from the time of the 2008 CES show in Vegas. I was looking for something to replace my aging Canon SD500. Since that was a great camera overall, I had high expectations.. The contenders I narrowed it down to were basically the Canon SD790IS, Canon SD890IS, Canon SD1100IS, Panasonic DMC-FX35, Olympus 1030SW and the Fuji Finepix F100fd.. Each camera had its pluses and minuses. After testing each camera out at the store, I ended up feeling the Canon SD790IS had the best blend of features overall. In addition to this, the 3" Screen was far-and-away the most vivid &#38; clear of the bunch. Also, the excellent Canon menu system combined with the jog dial and recessed RAZR-like buttons provided the greatest ease of use in my opinion. I actually really wanted to like the Olympus 1030SW but the clumsy menu system and mandatory use of XD cards caused me to eliminate it as a contender.. Now that I've used the camera on a few occasions, I am really impressed so far. The startup time is lightning fast. Shot-to-shot cycle times are very fast. And there is also virtually no shutter lag...which is a big difference compared to my old SD500. The face detection technology with the Digic III processor is amazing. Little floating rectangular boxes on the screen always are able to locate each person's face and focus in on them. It however does not work for pets from my testing. Pictures in various lighting conditions (indoor/outdoor) have been awesome so far. We were in a dimly lit club and the pics we took came out perfectly. My old SD500 would have overexposed and bleached out everybody's faces. Though it is not capable of HD video, movie mode is still very good. Paired with a 16GB SDHC card, you can really take some long movies if needed. Other pluses include the truly awesome screen. It's so crisp and large that I really don't care about the missing optical viewfinder. It's also great for using it as a photo album with friends &#38; family. One really cool feature is that the screen has a tilt sensor much like an iPhone and will automatically tilt the picture for best viewing whether you are holding the camera horizontally or vertically.. Minor gripes are that I wish it was slightly more compact like some of the Casio Exilims out there. The inclusion of features like HD Video (like the Panasonic DMC-FX35) and being Waterproof and Shockproof (like the Olympus 1030SW) would have made this my dream camera...but c'est la vie...This already is pretty darn good overall. Really the best compact shooter as of April 2008.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim design, excellent styling and build quality, large crystal clear 3.0" display, easy to use controls, intuitive interface. 
Cons:. No widescreen movie mode, glossy screen collects fingerprints easily, included 32MB SD card is a waste. 
Summary:. Canon has hit a home run for me with the (as of yet pending) release of the Canon SD790 IS. My wife and purchased the SD 750 last year and it has worked very well. I spent some time recently underway on an aircraft carrier and wanted something portable to take with me and chose the Sony T2. Despite it's styling the camera (as submitted by editors and reviewers here) had a less-than-stellar interface and took soft photos.. Enter the brand-new Canon SD790 IS. Despite it's "late March" availability I was able to purchase one online from Circuitcity.com. (Only store that shows it as stocked and available pending the actual release date. If you're looking for this camera, they likely have it in your area and you can purchase it -- though only online with in store pickup or delivery) The camera has yet to be "officially released", so even though I had purchased online the store manager would not let me look at a box in the display case since it was not yet "available." (Talk about a lack of common sense on the store's part!). The packaging and included accessories are what you've come to expect if you've owned a Canon point and shoot in the past. Only downside is manufacturer's reluctance to include a memory card of any relevance - a 32 MB card is a waste of space. Are they trying to clear long-held inventory? With the price of a new Extreme III SanDisk SD card around $39, a 1GB should be the new standard.... though I'm sure there is some sort of collusion with the memory card manufacturers.. The camera, thankfully, operates in a very similar fashion to the SD750. Notable additions are the extremely nice (and glossy) 3.0-inch 4:3 display. Comparing both cameras side by side didn't prove the colors to be any "better", but it certainly looks nice the way it's integrated into the camera. The controls are similar as well, though now there is a dial that actually spins (albeit not well when brand-new) to toggle through menu or shooting options. At first glance the SD790 looked larger physically than the 750, but it's simply an illusion because of the single color design of the case (the black/silver combination of the 750 is quite slimming). Other than a style upgrade to the buttons, is operates largely the same.. Taking pictures at the highest resolution setting provided excellent quality (10M/superfine/autofocus). Photos from both the 790 and 750 were uploaded into iPhoto on a 17" glossy screen Macbook Pro for comparative purposes. The 790 shots were extremely crisp and showed few artifacts. The added IS (image stabilization) definitely helped in low light situations, where the 750 would occasionally inject a slight blur due to camera shake.. With an extremely solid build quality, the same retail price as the returned Sony T2 (which is 8.1MP btw), and above average feature set the Canon SD790 has already proven to be an excellent choice. Looking forward to taking it overseas for a more "in depth" review.. 

$$;
Pros:. I am not expert in cameras, so i judge only by quality of the image. Considering that it is a comparative inexpensive, it is a very good camera. I like the many automatic features it offers and yet it allows you to manually adjust.. 
Cons:. This camera can do better in certain areas of automatic exposure setup. I am talking about bad pictures it takes when filming in low light settings, or bright days. This is easily fixed by adjusting exposure setting.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent picture quality, good zoom features, multipule settings for day and night, compact design is easy to carry, battery life is long enough and LCD screen is big and bright.. 
Cons:. the memory card is only 32 megs and only holds about 10 pics, had to buy a 4 gig card ($20) The thumb wheel is confusing and difficult to manage, the settings menus are all over the place and difficult to remember.. 
Summary:. Overall this camera is a great buy if picture quality is your greatest selling point. I would recomend it to others for its price and quality. I am not crazy about the silver color though, it is dull and boring, I wish they made a red, blue or green model beacuse style is often overlooked as a quality feature. All in all a very good camera, my Barrett Jackson car auction pics were outstanding.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Picture Quality in good lighting situations.. Large Screen. Scroll wheel is a physical wheel that makes navigating easier. Slight learning curve. Large LCD made of scratch resistant glass. Good battery life.. 
Cons:. I found some red eye with people with nonbrown eyes. Weird. It's easily correctable with the camera's built in manual red-eye correction function. Pictures without flash may come out blurry.. 
Summary:. Solid construction. Feels heavy in a good way. Camera may be a bit large for some people. Stylish camera. flat buttons make camera more appealing but is somewhat unpractical. Sacrifying practicality for looks. Worth it in this case though.. Compared to the SD1100. This camera is slight larger and heavier than the sd1100. I prefer the weight of the sd790. The shutter button is smaller on the sd1100. There is a larger selection of scene modes on the sd790. Screen is larger on the sd790. I haven't compared the image quality on these cameras, but i'm sure theyre more or less similar. They both use the DIGIC III Processor. The megapixel difference is virtually negligible for me since I don't print extremely large pics. I own both the SD1100 and the SD790 and would recommend the latter overall for ease of use and screen size. I would recommend the sd1100 for people who want a simple point and shoot than compact and don't need any advanced functions that the sd790 has. CHECK THESE CAMERAS OUT IN PERSON.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent pictures and great pocket size. LCD size and focus check. Intuitive design. Camera does not have a view finder. You can cut, crop your image before printing directly from the camera. This camera has auto rotate and add date stamp.. 
Cons:. Short battery life. Sensitive center dial. No zoom in movie mode. Various descriptions indicate fill in flash, but No fill in flash in the user guide.. 
Summary:. Overall this is a great camera. I compared this camera with three others and found that the picture quality is my primary concern. I like the large LCD and never used the view finder on my previous canon cameras. I would like a better zoom and movie zoom in a similar size camera but the technology is not here yet. The camera feel solid and is easy to use since most of the functions are similar to previous canons.. 

$$;
Pros:. 10 megapixels for cropping and zooming, big 3-inch screen, great scene modes, great look, etc.. 
Cons:. Scroll wheel tough to get used to.. 
Summary:. I just go the camera about a week ago, and I love it. I've been waiting to actually see some footage of it and I saw a great video of the device over on Tiger.tv, and it is just super gorgeous. The picture quality is phenomenal with its 10 megapixels as well as being a Canon. The 3X zoom could be a little bigger (5X maybe), but is fine. The new scroll wheel navigations is a little tough to get used to, but gets easier over time. The curves on the camera are beautiful and everything about it screams great camera. You can find it on the web for less than the $349 price tag, I got it for $315 on Amazon and they had a discount on a 4GB memory card to bring the card to only $10. Overall, buy this camera - you'll love it. Canon just never disappoints. - http://blargkaboom.com. 

$$;
Pros:. simple to use, great picture and great price. 
Cons:. Nothing that I can think.. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding photos, very nice screen, nice style, quick start up and shot recovery.. 
Cons:. Buttons are cramped and I hit the review button accidently a few times. Wheel is too sensitive and I have changed the shot modes accidently.. 
Summary:. Nice clean design that shoot great photos. Playback button should be switched with print button and wheel should have a disconnect feature.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image quality. 
Cons:. Feature set lacks several essentials. 
Summary:. I have a two-year-old PowerShot A700, with 6 megapixels, 6X zoom, an optical viewfinder, and it runs on standard AA batteries; it can also zoom in movie mode. (Alas, no image stabilization.) I don't see ANY of these features in the 790 IS. I would love to upgrade to get IS, but most definitely not at the expense of all these essentials.. Canon has definitely blown it on this model. I'll upgrade as soon as one of the compact digital manufacturers stops futzing around with gimmicky features and gets serious about the basic feature set.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast, compact. 
Cons:. specific battery, external charger; compared to other fuji, poor picture. 

$$;
Pros:. It took great photo/video when it worked..... 
Cons:. Well, the lens stopped functioning abruptly after 9 months (wouldn't open). MANY other people have this same problem - google it! The camera is useless now - I never abused, never dropped, NOTHING.. 
Summary:. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. I am just one of many people who have had the lens functionality fail them in a 9 month period. It takes great photos and video but beware - it will stop working on you and without reason. It was fine one minute and then totally useless the next.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great camera that fits in your pocket and easy to use.. 
Cons:. Red Eye Constantly, I shoot a lot of pictures using flash and have to go into camera and take out all the red eye.. 
Summary:. I'm frustated removing red eye, I'm taking it back and trying out a Nikon. People tell me that it's common to have red eye with digital cameras, but this is too much.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was well rated here but has completely failed my test.. 
Cons:. There is no view finder, you have to rely on the screen which I find very hard to do especially when outdoors or in bright light conditions.. For a 10mp camera this takes the most grainy photos, my old Kodak easy share 3mp took clearer shots.. 
Summary:. Don't waste your money, for about $50 less you can get a better camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has many features like those in this class. 
Cons:. Blurry corners, barrel effect. 
Summary:. I bought this camera based on the reviews here. I returned it only after a few hours after seeing the pictures at full quality on my PC. There is a significant amount of barrel effect along with blurred corners on all pictures. This the worst quality of pictures of any camera I've seen. I had to research again, this time with more objective websites with reviews of corner sharpness, ISO and lens quality and low and behold, this camera was rated as the worst on corner sharpness. I also found out that the whole line up of these PowerShot cameras suffer from the same effects, barrel effect and very poor corner sharpness. After seeing many reviews of similar products in the same price range I found the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS20 $10.00 cheaper and it takes perfect pictures. Amazing clarity. Enough said..
