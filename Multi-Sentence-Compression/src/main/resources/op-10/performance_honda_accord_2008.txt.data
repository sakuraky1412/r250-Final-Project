No problem with quality, performance, etc .
t anywhere close to 3 series on many facets, namely performance, but sadly to say, in others, it surpasses .
Performance is outstanding, more like a sports car than a coupe .
Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .
Engine performance is very lacking .
It has room, performance, good MPG for its size and excellent reliability .
Overall performance is good but comfort level is poor .
If you want sports sedan handling and performance, then pay much more and buy a true sports sedan !
The performance is incredible !
I'm impressed with the performance as well as efficiency gains .
