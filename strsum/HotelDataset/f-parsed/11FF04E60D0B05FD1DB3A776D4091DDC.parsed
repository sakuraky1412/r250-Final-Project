i/LS usually/RB stay/VB in/IN hilton/NN hotels/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX was/VBD not/RB one/CD in/IN bahrain/NN so/RB i/FW opted/VBD for/IN the/DT sheraton/JJ brand/NN instead/RB ./.

the/DT hotel/NN was/VBD probably/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT first/JJ hotels/NNS to/TO be/VB built/VBN in/IN this/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT city/NN -/: the/DT diplomatic/JJ quarter/NN ./.

when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD first/JJ built/VBN it/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN quite/RB the/DT cutting/VBG edge/NN ./.

but/CC all/DT that/DT was/VBD a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ago/RB and/CC bahrain/RB now/RB has/VBZ many/JJ newer/JJR hotels/NNS ./.

the/DT sheraton/NN has/VBZ not/RB kept/VBN up/RP ./.

rooms/NNS were/VBD dated/VBN but/CC clean/JJ ./.

small/JJ windows/NNS meant/VBD the/DT rooms/NNS was/VBD too/RB bit/RB dark/JJ during/IN the/DT day/NN -LRB-/-LRB- this/DT might/MD be/VB a/DT positive/JJ given/VBN the/DT sunlight/NN ,/, but/CC air/NN cons/NNS keep/VBP the/DT rooms/NNS cool/VBP so/RB i/FW would/MD consider/VB it/PRP as/IN a/DT design/NN fault/NN -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC there/EX was/VBD direct/JJ view/NN out/IN of/IN the/DT room/NN possible/JJ when/WRB at/IN the/DT desk/NN or/CC on/IN the/DT bed/NN ./.

my/PRP$ room/NN was/VBD next/JJ to/TO the/DT lounge/NN on/IN the/DT 10th/JJ floor/NN -/: i/FW was/VBD woken/VBN up/IN both/DT mornings/NNS very/RB early/RB by/IN the/DT lounge/NN being/VBG prepared/VBN ./.

not/RB sure/JJ why/WRB i/FW was/VBD put/VBN next/JJ to/TO the/DT lounge/NN as/IN the/DT hotel/NN seemed/VBD empty/JJ -LRB-/-LRB- more/RBR on/IN that/DT below/IN -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC people/NNS must/MD have/VB complained/VBN about/IN the/DT noise/NN before/IN -LRB-/-LRB- it/PRP was/VBD not/RB just/RB the/DT noise/NN of/IN plates/NNS etc/FW it/PRP was/VBD loud/JJ voices/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

an/DT empty/JJ hotel/NN ,/, but/CC noisy/JJ rooms/NNS !/.

the/DT breakfast/NN buffet/NN was/VBD a/DT good/JJ spread/NN if/IN you/PRP wanted/VBD it/PRP -/: i/FW just/RB went/VBD for/IN coffee/NN and/CC porridge/NN -LRB-/-LRB- both/DT of/IN which/WDT were/VBD good/JJ -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

i/LS was/VBD booked/VBN into/IN a/DT club/NN room/NN which/WDT had/VBD access/NN to/TO the/DT lounge/NN ./.

not/RB sure/RB this/DT was/VBD worth/IN the/DT cost/benefit/NN as/IN the/DT lounge/NN was/VBD small/JJ and/CC the/DT breakfast/NN offerings/NNS were/VBD poor/JJ ./.

i/LS did/VBD not/RB use/VB the/DT lounge/NN after/IN checking/VBG it/PRP out/RP once/RB and/CC having/VBG a/DT coffee/NN ./.

the/DT strangest/JJ thing/NN was/VBD the/DT hotel/NN seemed/VBD very/RB empty/JJ -/: the/DT reception/NN was/VBD not/RB the/DT normal/JJ hive/NN of/IN activity/NN and/CC the/DT staff/NN seemed/VBD somewhat/RB surprised/VBN to/TO see/VB guests/NNS ./.

after/IN the/DT shock/NN of/IN seeing/VBG a/DT guest/NN the/DT staff/NN were/VBD polite/JJ and/CC friendly/JJ though/RB ./.

sitting/VBG alone/RB in/IN the/DT evening/NN buffet/NN was/VBD odd/JJ ./.

a/DT group/NN of/IN american/JJ youth/NN did/VBD join/VB the/DT buffet/NN for/IN about/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS -/: they/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB roaming/VBG the/DT hotel/NN being/VBG loud/JJ and/CC out/IN of/IN control/NN ./.

they/PRP were/VBD the/DT only/JJ other/JJ guests/NNS i/FW saw/NN ./.

rooms/NNS service/NN was/VBD efficient/JJ ./.

but/CC all/DT in/IN all/DT i/FW would/MD describe/VB this/DT hotel/NN experience/NN as/IN an/DT odd/JJ one/CD and/CC i/FW was/VBD pleased/VBN to/TO leave/VB ./.
