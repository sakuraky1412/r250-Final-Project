Pros:. I had SIX Lacie "Big Disks" over the past 2-3 years. They all still worked perfectly fine. Very reliable!. I also love that you can stack them.. 
Cons:. A little on the heavy, but then again its not as flimsy as a plastic Book.. 
Summary:. Perfect external storage for professionals that don't need to extra speed of a Raid.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price for a 500GB drive compatible with Firewire (800 &#38; 400) and USB2. Looks good on desktop too. LaCie online tech support is great, friendly fast and accommodating (see below). 
Cons:. Power supply adapter failed after 1 year causing computer (iMac) to fail to recognize the drive. Lacie tech support diagnosed problem and replaced defective equipment. Drive works like a champ, again.. 
Summary:. I'll buy LaCie again. I positive experience with tech support is big thing. Who care's what kind of hardware you buy when it works, but when the thing breaks down a good warranty and competent tech support is worth it's weight in gold.. 

$$;
Pros:. The multiple interface options allows the drive to work with any computer. The firewire connection allows for one cable to run between the drives and the computer. The rack mount option keeps the drives off the desk and allows for adequate cooling.. 
Cons:. none to think of. 
Summary:. Excellent drive for the money. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, multiplicity of interfaces, heat dissipation. 
Cons:. Reliability is hit and miss.. 
Summary:. I run a lab supporting a number of film students, and I take really good care of all equipment that I own and oversee.. It has been my experience that LaCie d2 hard drives work wonderfully when they work. You get excellent connection speeds, and they offer a great multiplicity of connection options.. However, if the drive doesn't work you will know it. I have seen many drives come through my labs, and the fact is that brand new LaCie drives fail. Not all. I'd say about 1 in 10 or 15 will fail within the first 2 weeks of use.. For that reason I feel that I can no longer recommend them to the students and staff because often they will lose all of their project data after getting the drive and using it to capture, or as a primary data source.. But when they work, they work really well.. 

$$;
Pros:. when it worked it was quiet and unassuming.. 
Cons:. 2 year and two crashes, too often. I had to pay to ship it to LACIE the first time to get it fixed.. 
Summary:. a friend of mine owns a cheaper WD for longer than I had the LACIE, the WD is still working even after being shipped cross country a year ago.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well when it works.. 
Cons:. Fails without warning. Widespread problems with power supply that fails after time. Mine failed after 1 year. Raised support ticket and no response after 5 days. Support totally inadequate.. 
Summary:. When the drive works its wonderful. Fast backup. Installs on Mac without a hitch. Power supply problem causes drive to fail to mount after time and mine cannot be used with the power supply. Useless if this is your main backup drive. LaCie UK offer online support which is extremely poor. Raised support ticket for replacement power unit and no response after 5 days. Still waiting for response. LaCie drives are not cheap and the support should be much better.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was easy to set up and it is a fast drive.. 
Cons:. It would sometimes just not be accessible. I would have to disconnect it, power it back up, wait 15 seconds, then plug the drive back in for it to be seen by the PC. The slightest jolt caused it to crash.. 
Summary:. I have had it for 2.5 years, and it has crashed multiple times. When it crashed I didn't lose the data on it, but it was a pain to have to go through the reboot/reconnect process over and over again. Finally, the last time it would never connect again. It is officially dead, and I won't be buying a LaCie to replace it.. 

$$;
Pros:. When this drive actually mounted, it was great. Fast. I used it to backup my design files and store 200gb of music, which I streamed flawlessly to my work computer.. 
Cons:. After just over a year, my iTunes couldn't locate the music files. I restarted my machine and my drive, it remounted. iTunes played music for about 10 minutes, then drive beeped a few times and it was done.. 
Summary:. It seems like I need a backup drive for the backup drive of my backup drive.. Our IT took the failed drive out of its case and mounted it directly into my machine. Its holding up for now as I back up all of my design files to our server and another harddrive. Not sure if I'd buy another LaCie drive again. This is the second drive that has failed me personally.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks great. Solid metal casing. Easy-to-use backup software.. 
Cons:. Other than the fact that the Quadra failed without warning after one year of service, it worked fine. Fortunately, I was diligent with my paperwork and have warranty coverage.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well finished case, good performance. 
Cons:. Failed after 1.5 year of use, useless software. 
Summary:. I would buy another for me, but surely I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks great. Solid metal casing. Easy-to-use backup software.. 
Cons:. Other than the fact that the Quadra failed without warning after one year of service, it worked fine. Unfortunately, I was not diligent with my paperwork and I do not have warranty coverage.. 
Summary:. I don't believe this is a good product and will not buy LaCie again as a result.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well when it works, speedy and great performance, again, when it performs.. 
Cons:. More often then not it just stops being recognized by my pc. I have traced the problem to the power connector at the drive. Something inside fails.. 
Summary:. I'm still under the 2 manufacturers warranty and I'm going to see if they'll replace it, but from what I've read now, a replacement will just do the same thing. I won't buy another LaCie. I have a 250G LaCie drive and it's worked fine since I got it in early 2006. It still works like a champ. But not the Quadra. Once I get this worked out with LaCie(and believe me I'm sure I'm in for a long haul), I won't buy their stuff again. I just don't need the headache.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was fast and compatible with Mac Time machine.. 
Cons:. Not reliable. I missed the warranty because i was lax.. 
Summary:. I paid a good buck for this d2 quadra but it was a waste of money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good looking unit, feels solid.. 
Cons:. This 500 Gig drive crashed within 3 weeks, started to make clunking sounds and then it stoped all together.Lacie Tech Service contradicted themselves several times. I have the emails to back this up. The product was more expensive than other units.. 
Summary:. Sometimes the higher priced units are not worth the money. In this case the unit was at a premium price compared to other 500 Gig units and still failed miserably within three weeks (probably 8-12 hours of actual use). I could elaborate on the poor Tech Services but this summary is intended for the product itself.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing positve. 
Cons:. Complete Junk. Lost all data on drive.. 
Summary:. Lost all data. lacie is junk!!! do not buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Seagate drives inside are solid SATA 2. unit construction feel great. Nice design.. 
Cons:. Large and unreliable power supply. Interface is sub-par. Enclosure is tight fit that can heat up lowering lifespan of drives. no fan. Aluminum acts as sound amplifier making drives very loud for not having a fun.. 
Summary:. Don't buy these. The interface &#38; power supply fail rate is way too high. I have feeling many users hear the first sign of trouble - clicking - and assume drive is bad. Not true. Get it out of enclosure and connect directly via sata and solid power supply. Drive shoot boot right up. The drives are not the problem, it is design and quality control issue that Lacie is quickly becoming known for ? in the past, Lacie stood for quality, but these drives are wrecking havoc on that reputation. I will still vouche for the Rugged. Possibly the best FW drive I have ever purchased but it not intended for desktop file serving or back-up like the D2 line. In my personal experience I have owned three of these and two have failed. I have recently switched to a Netgear ReadyNAS NV+ unit with raid for file serving and a free agent for Time Machine back-up. The free agent has the same drives as the Lacie and is whisper quiet and came with superior software/support.. 

$$;
Pros:. When the drive worked it was quick.. 
Cons:. Very loud when the drive spun up, about every 15 minutes. The drive just stopped working one day. Just clicks and does nothing else.. 

$$;
Pros:. Flexible interface.. 
Cons:. Unreliable. Terrible quality. Unacceptable customer service. Useless tech support.. 
Summary:. Do not buy LaCie. You will regret it! They have very poor tech support. They do not support their products. After your drive fails, and it will, they will make you pay to ship the drive in and then they will send you a remanufactured unit. Do not buy LaCie!. 

$$;
Pros:. worked great for a a year.No problems quick and easy to use.. 
Cons:. stopped working with no warning. warranty is expired.. 
Summary:. I'm gonna have to gut the unit and attach the hard drive to my PC to retrieve all my files and records for my business. Thanks Lacie I won't be buying any of your products again and will advise associates and friends to do the same.. 

$$;
Pros:. Zip!! Absolutely nothing!!. 
Cons:. noisy, slow, awful software, disconnects, power cord burns out often. very large and clumsy. 
Summary:. Purchased 2 - What a mistake!! After a few months blue light kept searching and computer wouldn't make it to the desktop, often. I thought it was my computer. I finally contacted tech support after about a year who told me the power pack had to be replaced and it was past warrantee. I purchased a heavy duty one. 6 months later I had to purchase another. I now have to purchase another power pack. I recently found the second drive and tried to connect it after 2 years - completely dead! Tech support told me it's beyond warrantee. Never ever purchase a LaCie product!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks Pretty. 
Cons:. Failed in less than two years.. 
Summary:. I bought this drive when another LaCie started to show signs of failure. I transferred all my data to it.. Yesterday it failed without warning. Since the two drives that failed are the newest of four that I own, I can only surmise that the quality of LaCie's product has declined.. Trust your user reviews! Don't buy this product.. Updated. on Jun 30, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Stands vertically for better shelf space. 
Cons:. Poor construction and horrible support.. 
Summary:. After mechanical failure and complete data loss, LaCie effectively said "that's too bad." I'll never buy another LaCie product!!.
