Pros:. Very easy to use. Bluetooth feature is great. With the built in list feature of addresses and phone numbers of so many needs, places, shopping, restaurants and sites made driving to find car dealerships in area to buy my sons car this weekend a snap.. 
Cons:. My wife and son and rest of family all now need to have one. I guess their B-Day gifts are down for this year coming.. 
Summary:. I researched the heck out of this Garmin 660 and many GPS's including Tom Tom prior to buying myself fior Christmas. This is an awesome GPS. Anyone not happy probably is not happy with life and always lQQking to point out the sky is falling evrytime there is a cloud about. This unit has so many features theres not enough room to list. Tow buddies received Tom Tom and were off 500' from a 56 mile test destination we did today. This Garmin put me right in front. I never needed direction before, now I don't know how I lived without one for so mnay years. Also, being a hunter this will always be packed with my gear. The bluetooth feature is awesome. My phone list on my blackberry actually is shown on this unit. I don't need to wear those annoying ear pieces anymore. Thankyou Garmin..

Pros:. 4.3 screen, bluetooth, SD card, MP3 player, photo viewer, text messages sync to your phone, sync with Motorola KRZR k1, custom maps through google or mapquest download to your gps.. 
Cons:. some text message names appeared as ascii characters before resetting.. 
Summary:. Love the auto recalculating when you miss your exit. Text messages appear and you're prompted to listen,review or ignore, custom POIs from google or mapquest, updates from Garmin.com easy to do. Photos can autoplay, album covers appear as song plays.. Updated. on Aug 10, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Screen, Bluetooth functions, speed of map drawing upon changing course. 
Cons:. If there is a perfect GPS, this is it.. 
Summary:. For all of those who had any trouble at all with this and put a review here, I have to say this was simple to set up and use. I've never owned a portable GPS until this one. I've had it about 6 weeks and used it both locally and on an out of state trip and it works beautifully. I'm especially pleased with the bluetooth functions. My phone rings and I have hands-free cell phone usage now! An added benefit to bluetooth is that I can look up food, lodging, gas, etc with it and change course to any of those locations on the fly.. Finally, I am impressed with how fast the Nuvi 660 re-calculates a change when you deviate from your set course. Amazing.. I love the wide touch screen and price of around $550 seems very fair for all the features this baby packs in.. Kudos to Garmin for this product. If you had trouble with this, I have to wonder if you are using it correctly.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. Expensive but reliable. 
Summary:. I am a business owner. We have numerous trucks. Our first GPS was the magellan 700 then the 6000T. If it wasn't for the 4 year extented warrenty we purchased, we would have been out a lot of money. the magellans were trash. always crashing and losing memory. constint repairs. We replaced them with the Garman 660. After a year we couldn't be happier. the FM tuner is great so the employees can answer their phones in the truck while driving and the sound is very clear. It is nice to listen to a good book while traveling and listing to mp3's. I no longer listen to my cd player in our car. To me, I don't mind paying extra for quality. Garman is quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Garmin Nuvi 660 has everything you need so whats not to w. 
Cons:. nothing really only with the fm transmitter it is scratchy. 

$$;
Pros:. Super bright Widescreen, ACCURATE directions, Excellent Reception. 
Cons:. Maybe just a louder speaker. 
Summary:. I origionally purchased a Magellan Maestro. It was not that great, Directions were not that good and the screen was unreadable in sunlight.. So I did my research and got the Garmin NUVI. It's Fantastic. Its one of the best Navigtion systems I've had so far. I love the Widescreen you get alot more viewing area and the Nuvi's Screen is Super-Bright and the colors are superb.. It has a SIRFIII Chipset for accurate satellite reception in the city and under trees. Also very accurate directions. Text To Speach is great feature to have and just overall a great unit. COuld not live without it I would definatly recomend purchasing this unit. I got mine on Walmart for $650.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy, versatile GPS unit.... 
Cons:. price tag.. A bit Hefty...... 
Summary:. A great unit! Other than the price, I'm extremely happy with the purchase. It seems that the negatives that the "Tech Savy people" are writting about have to do with price &#38; what your getting for it. Apparently they need more?. I agree, it's not a cheap GPS unit by any means. But for me it does everything I need- It gives me directions ACCURATELY, bluetooth capabilities &#38; traffic updates. It's got a good screen, nice and thin unit &#38; volume on the unit is plenty loud for me. Start time &#38; recalculating directions are quick... I would highly recommend if price is no object.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate Navigation, Bluetooth Phone Sync, Easy to use. 
Cons:. A little expensive. 
Summary:. This is quite simply a remarkable product. It is easy to use, portable, clear bright LCD. It even has options like, Pedestrian mode if youre walking. I rarely have found a product to be nearly flawless but after using it for over a month I cant seem to find a downside.. 

$$;
Pros:. Razor sharp 4.3" display and all the extras.. 
Cons:. No remote and window mount too far from driver. Price $749.00. 
Summary:. After test driving a Magellan and Tom Tom I decided to try the 660 due to the Garmin reputation and the large high resolution screen. I was not disappointed. The 660 does everything well and more.. It is faster, more accurate, and easier to use than the others. The bluetooth phone feature works great and seamlessly works with your phone to put all of your phone info onscreen. Incoming calls flash on screen like a large caller ID display.. The FM transmitter puts the 660 on your cars radio easily. I still have the traffic and MP3 player to try out, but I am sure they will work well like the other features.. The 660 is very light and well designed for installing and removing from your dash. There is a lock feature that uses a code or location to unlock the unit.. The GPS part of the unit is fantastic. It locks on quickly and reroutes fast. Loading destinations is easy and fast. The only problem I had with the menus is there are so many features it is confusing with all the selections at first.. The best part of the 660 is the 4.3" crystal clear high res display. It burns through the brightest glare with ease. There are no problems with glare at all with this screen. The display is enough to pick the 660 even without all the extra toys. All the side streets and script are easily readable.. Garmin keeps its lead and continues to bury the competition with the 660.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Navigational tool.. 
Cons:. Small Screen. 
Summary:. After owning several GPS systems, and I would say, almost all of them do their job well, I finally found a gem of a GPS. Here in Las Vegas, sometimes the road take very tricky twists and turns; but this little marvel of technology finds the route in a jiffy. Add to that MP3, a wonderful Language Guide with words and phrases, a bilngual dictionary; a travel guide that tells you where to find gas stations, restaurants, hotels, etc. near your location, and so many extras deserve this GPS a place in a time capsule.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Easy to use and has all the EXTRAS.. 
Cons:. Have had no problems with it yet.. 
Summary:. I purchased mine the day that they were released and have had a great time learning how to use it,the GPS tracking is spot on and shows the map well,the FM transmitter works great with my car stereo and the voice comes through loud and clear,it is easy to program and when it recalculates routes it is done very fast.. There are so many different things that it does well it would take pages to cover it all and all I can say is that I was going to first get the C550 but am glad I waited for this to come out.As for price well if you look on the web you can find it at a good price like I did for $764.00 and free shipping not the $999.00 like most places want for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Terrific screen clarity and color. 
Cons:. I have not experienced any cons with the unit. 
Summary:. The Garmin 660 does everything I could have hoped or expected. Have taken it on 2 trips and it performed perfectly. Used it in my hometown where I know the best routes and the Garmin 660 took me exactly where it should have every time. Great GPS.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great maps w/ understandable txt to speech. 
Cons:. No aux jack on window mount. 
Summary:. I've used this GPS device on long trips and have never had a problem. It does all of the basics really well while allowing me to listen to MP3s in my car. My only gripe is that there is no Aux jack on the mount so I have to plug it in every time I snap it in place inside my car.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, no downloading maps, nice easy to see screen.. 
Cons:. none as of yet.. 
Summary:. I have had the product for about three months and love it. I work in the city and travel a great deal so it was perfect for me. All the maps are preloaded and very easy to navigate.. 

$$;
Pros:. Theres an excellent database of points-of-interest here.. 
Cons:. There are occasional point-of-interest problems.. 
Summary:. Garmin nuvi 660: **** (4 Stars). A GPS unit makes road trips more enjoyable, more safe, and more fun. In the annals of useful inventions, it ranks up there with the wheel, the bread slicer, and the washing machine. If you are in the market for a GPS  and if you own an RV, you should be  then the Garmin nuvi 660 is a brilliant choice..

$$;
Pros:. Very accurate navatigating.. 
Cons:. Price. Although it has gone down since I bought it.. 
Summary:. I bought this a year ago and paid $900. The price has come down substantially since I purchased this navigation system. I'm shocked to read bad reviews. I've been on a few vacations with this navigation system, and it has been right on. New York, DC, Miami Beach, Tennessee, Santa Fe, Grand Canyon to name a few and whether I'm just using it walking or driving this navigation system has been right on the money - turn by turn naming the streets with total accuracy. The display &#38; voice clarity is wonderful. The restaurant feature and shopping feature I use on the weekends and have discovered restaurants that are hidden away in the nearby suburbs that I didn't even know were there. You can indicate Italian and a list will appear along with the address and phone number. I don't use the bluetooth feature because I have an iPhone, but I love this navigation system and I would buy it again in a heartbeat!. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive bright 3d maps, traffic alerts, FM audio out, hands free cell phone,sexy female voice. 
Cons:. Traffic mode requires 12v cord plug in, no weather. 
Summary:. In 2005 I paid twice as much for a Garmin 2610 that was big heavy had to be attached to a 12v power source and you had to download the maps you wanted with limited standard memory. My Nuvi 660 has a very bright 3D easy to scan display maps preloaded and traffic alerts. I tested it using my OnStar GPS and found it to be more intuitive and versatile, you can play the audio on your car FM stereo and quickly navigate around traffic while talking hands free on your cell. The unit has a much smaller foot print on my dash with fast acquire times for satellites. With the Nuvi internal battery it will also replace my handheld GPS and MP3 player on backpacking trips.. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use, screen and menu layouts, useful features for me, great price now vs. other models, solid reputation and reliability, nav. performance, mounting system, garmin updates and service.. 
Cons:. I would like some upscale features like voice activated navigation, more route options, personalized map updates as per TomTom.. 
Summary:. I bought a Nuvi 670 on sale for $479CDN. vs a TomTom GO920($449). Why, well it's like this. Garmin has the rep and the 670(660) has the reviews in a now time tested package and debugged vs. GO920(720) that are loaded with features but have questionable reliability and company service. Of 3 top consumer magazine reviews the 670 came out on top of the TomToms, mostly on navigating performance. Even so I might never have noticed myself, but there were other reasons. I have no preference for brand, only a best value.. 1. My personal preference for the screen display was Garmin. It was in my opinion that it was clean, bright, unclutterd, and provided just the right info for me. The short cuts on the map and main menu give me quick access to my most important funtions, and side by side it takes up to half the button presses to do the same operation as the TomTom.. 2. Customizing my Garmin to perform how I like it is a breeze. I can change my vehicle settings to give me more warning time for when I'm towing a rig, and set up blue tooth to do most everything hands free and over the vehicle sound system. Things it will do that TomTom won't: Broadcast phone calls from bluetooth phone over car FM radio. Adjust separate MP3 volume and navigation volume so you can balance them out for a pleasant experience instead of volume adjusting all the time. The phone over the FM stereo is a big one, as you need the extra volume if you use the phone as I am to replace the Onstar system.. 3. All phones I've seen tried have worked with the 670, not so with the GO920. My LG muzik and LG shine hook up and work 100%. I use the Nuvi 670 as my main system in my 2008 GMC sierra 3500hd, replacing the expensive onstar calling and navigation. As soon as I get in my truck and place the Nuvi in the holder( no power cable fiddling is nice) it hooks up bluetooth and gives me directions, hands free calling(using the LG's voice dial via bluetooth, which is awesome thru the Nuvi), and my MP3 music all at once, automatically pause one to allow the more important funtion to broadcast over vehicle's stereo. A cost effective and highly enjoyable alternative to mimic Onstar features. One year subscription to onstar pays for my Nuvi, and phone calls are free on my cell plan vs. Onstars $0.47/min. TomTom will not give me phone over the FM transmitter, but will do music and navigation.(OOPS?). 4. I was nervous about the weak Garmin FM transmitter, but with my setup it works great. I use the dash mount adesive pad that the suction cup sticks to and mounted the unit on the dash right above my stereo controls of my 2008 GMC truck. Touching the unit is as easy as touching the stereo for both driver and front passenger, and the flip up antennae has a clear view out the sloping windsheild. I also believe that the 600 series nuvis have better reception than the 700/800 integrated antennae units, but only by reviews I've seen.. 5. Mounting hardware is night and day better on the Garmin, suction cup performance isn,t even in the same league. Period. Same with FM traffic antennae, and Garmin came with case and all ac/dc/usb hookups.. 6.I did mention the seperate volume controls, which had me almost taking the Garmin back before I found them and improved the balance so one volume setting on car stereo was balanced between the MP3 and navigation voice. Not on the TomTom that I nor any one else could find.. 7. Garmin updates from their website was easy and instant, and free new 2008/2009 updates for maps of Europe and North America on the way.. 8. I was really, really tempted by the user updated maps on the TomTom. I was really tempted by the extra routing capacity and some of it's more modern features. I was drooling to have voice activated navigation of the GO920, but after using the nuvi paired to the phones voice controls and phone book, I am happier with what I have now.. In summary, it's what you want, what you will pay for, for features and performance, I went with proven tech, multiple award winning reviews,easiest use, proven navigation, and stayed away from the unproven new product that generates a 'perceived' excessive amount of problems( TomTom Go series). A few features on the Garmin made my personal preference the Nuvi 670, but on a price to feature ratio I would not hesitate to tell a friend about the GO920, depending on how they were going to use it.. If any one has info on these two devices that may shed more light on which is more suitable for use in other situations please feel free to respond.. 

$$;
Pros:. good directions, large screen, simple interface, fast load. 
Cons:. imperfect accuracy, wierd power button functions, slow POI. 
Summary:. Overall, I am very satisfied with the Nuvi.. Some nice functionality are:. -Directions are for the most part good. I did have several instances where I disagreed with GPS, but really if you know where youre going its better not to be dependent on a machine.. -I really like the accuracy  it leaves enough time before a turn by indication that a change of direction is coming yet indicates a turn just at the right time. There is of course always room of improvement  once I was traveling along a highway and GPS indicated that I was right on it. I cannot really blame it since it was so close. But the next GPS better understand it.. -It is quiet fast to acquire satellites. Turn it on while you wait for the car to warm up and it will be ready by the time you need it.. -Large screen really makes a difference  more map is visible, large buttons &beauty. -Sound quality is pretty good, English pronunciations is pretty good, a few errors here and there but manageable.. -Security by location feature is nice  you go to a location and pick a pin code. Every time you turn on the device you enter your pin. To have GPS unlocked without a pin youll need to go to the security location.. -Bluetooth feature is great. My cell phones speaker phone is quiet weak so I connect it to GPS while in the car and make very clear phone calls.. -Large easy to use button. Excellent interface. -500 Megs of free space, you clean up unneeded files (like voice files to get another few megs) for additional stuff like MP3.. Some of the not-so-nice features that Ive noticed are:. -Battery not replaceable  if youre only going to use it in the car, its no big deal since you can always use a charger.. -Power button is whacky  it does too many things: toggles FM transmitter, provides screen to adjust volume, and yes it is used to turn device on/off. I would have really preferred if volume had a separate button/wheel.. -While using the GPS as a speaker phone for the phone, GPS does not announce directions. Hence you need to check the screen for the directions. I found it not great as I did expect at least some kind of indication.. -Search of Points of Interest is tedious  I tried to use it several times to search of POI (like a mountain resort, or a store chain) it took so long that I gave up and found the address online.. -Seems like the time does not change. I have it set to Daylight Savings Time and it is still one hour off. Weird.. -Night/Day screen is nice  this makes sure that the screen is in contrast to surrounding. However, the device does not actually sense that it became dark, it is purely driven by the current time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Connects fact, bluetooth, MP3 player. 
Cons:. Speaker not great for Playing MP3's. 
Summary:. I can't believe some people rate this unit poorly. They must work for the competition. For the price with the features it has it can't be beat, plus, it's a Garmin. I tried other cheaper brands of GPS devices and always ended up returning them because they had some querks. Finally after my son bought a Garmin and loved it, I decided to try them out. I'm glad I did. The 660 does just about everything I want. I can listen to MP3's while traveling and the GPS cuts in with directions when they are needed. The unit acquires a signal very fast and keeps me locked on. It re-calcs directions fast if you take a wrong turn, and does a real good job picking the right route. The only complaint is the speaker isn't great for playing MP3's, so either get headphones or attach to you car's audio through the FM transmitter or an AUX jack. The Bluetooth connected to my Samsung U740 and downloaded my address book into the unit. To make a call is as simple as point and touch. It also lets me use the name dial feature on my phone. I haven't used the traffic feature yet, because it is not available in parts of my area, so I can't comment on that yet. All in all the unit works just great. You can check for software updates by downloading and using the WEBUPDATER software from the Garmin site. It will make sure you always have the latest software patches, voices etc. I like that it has many different English speaking voices that use the Text-To-Speach functionality. (I personally like the female Australian English voice. For LOST fans she sounds like Claire). All in all with the current price and all the features, this is a great buy. I had it narrowed down between the nuvi 360 and the 660 and for the difference in price the 4.3 screen and the traffic capability pushed me to the 660. To add the traffic feaure to the 360 was at least $120 more. The price difference in the models when when I purchased was less than $70. So I purchased the 660 and I'm glad I did!.

Pros:. Fast , clear accurate directions, easy to read. 
Cons:. Master manual on CD. 
Summary:. My new Garmin is fantastic! It packs a lot of punch for the money ($449). I am an entertainer and producer and do a lot of traveling around the country. I have experience using a variety of makes and models from numerous car rental agencies. I also borrowed and /or bought and returned current models that were of interest to me. The Garmin 660 was the clear winner.. The most important thing of any GPS is how well it gets you to your destination in unfamiliar territory. So lets talk about that first. It took only a few seconds for the Garmin 660 to latch on to satellite signals! Even when surrounded by tall buildings it was extremely quick! Faster than any other brand I have used. If I missed an exit or street, I was amazed with the speed it recalculated an accurate re-route (Magellan took more time and always wanted me to take a u-turn)! Mapped routes were accurate, and voice prompts were very clear and easy to follow. The included FM option for voice worked well but is not needed. Upon entering highways, the Garmin 660 voice prompt advised me to keep left or right. A nice feature. If the next turn was not visible on the main map you just make a light tap on the right icon. A split the screen opens allowing you to view the actual exit and turn! I often made several unplanned stops and the Garmin accurately resumed my course. The traffic alert worked and was a blessing! Alternate rerouting was good but it cant match local knowledge. POI were very good and as up to date as can be expected. Finding gas stations and other POI was easy but not as easy as those GPS units that finish your spelling after several letters ,but I like the fact that it ranks nearby locations by distance. Sometimes it easier to turn around and go back 4 miles for gas instead of waiting 30 miles to get to the next station. The simulated route is a great pre-planner as well as the scroll feature. Whatever brand you select, that is a good feature to get.. The screen is superb! Large easy to read maps and icons, and it responds to a normal touch. Very similar to a Tom Tom I tried. On the other hand, Magellans fonts were small, cluttered, and difficult to read, and its screen didnt respond well to my touch. I do like Magellans concept of having active forks, gas pumps, hotels and similar icons. Tap the icons and the screen tells you what restaurants or gas stations, etc. are located ahead. The problem is that it is difficult to get the icons to respond to your touch and they were so close together that the wrong information often came up. Due to my occupation, the estimated time of arrival is a nice feature for me. It saved me from losing a hotel reservation. But that may not apply to everyone. Some users might prefer distance left, so you just tap on the ETA icon and it gives you the distance left and lots of other information. It would have been nice if Garmin included a turn arrow with the turn distance window, but as mentioned before one touch and you get a split screen that actually gives a view of the turn. Voice prompts will also gave you plenty of warning.. The Bluetooth capability is a nice feature if it will pair up with your phone. I didnt buy it because it had an MP3 playback, and audio books, or picture playback all via SD cards but I have already used the picture feature to look at pictures. I was anxious to see them on something larger than my camera screen. As stated earlier both the FM Voice and Traffic Receiver worked fine for me but not everyone may need it or have traffic alerts available in their area.. My only major gripe is that the master manual is on a CD so you must download it and print it out. The quick reference guide that comes with it is written well but there will be times you need to refer the full manual. There should also be a LARGE reminder to register for updates. The dealer told me that Garmin has done a fine job with updates and adjustments via the web. He actually preferred it over the new 760!. In summary, the Garmin 660 does what a GPS should to best; get you to a destination without unit, map, satellite, or directional problems and do at a sensible price. You cant go wrong with this one!. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth, MP3 player, Large display. 
Cons:. On-line support. 
Summary:. The Nuvi 660 is ready to go right out of the box. It is an amazing device that is incredibly easy to use. Large touch screen display, millions of points of interest, Even an MP3 player that I thought I would never use actually came in handy. The interface is very user friendly. However online support from Garmin is rather weak. An example of this is that I am traveling to San Diego and wanted to load up my GPS with maps for Tiajuana Mexico. Let's just say I am still trying to figure out how that is done. 

$$;
Pros:. This device is a gem and I've taken many a GPS for a test drive. User friendly Bluetooth, FM reciever, Audiobooks, Music, photo's. Too many pros to list.. 
Cons:. Suction cup mounting failure. $800.00 device entrusted to 10 cent suction cup.. 
Summary:. . My only suggestion would be that the Nuvi 660 be protected from harm by creating a base similar to a charging dock for a digital camera which could be adhered to a horizontal surface and allow the audio output to be accessed, while the device is mounted, preventing the GPS from being TOP HEAVY. Even on horizontal surfaces, the suction cup consistently fails. I wouldn't trust my digital camera to a suction cup and my Nuvi cost more than 3x the camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything MP3, Traffic Alerts, Auto Vision, Portable, Accurate,FM Modulator, Voice dial, Blue tooth &#38; SD card slot. 
Cons:. A little on the Expensive side. 
Summary:. Well what I can say about the Garmin 660 besides its great! Garmin Nuvi 660 covers just about everything you can't get lost even if the roads are under construction it will still get you there. The only people who I've seen personally get lost with this is the people who don't listen like my boyfriend.(LOL) I havent' been lost since I've purchased it. The battery last for a long time listen to MP3 and use the Navigation for at least 6 hours before it needs charging. It finds all the stores, banks, restaurants or what ever youre looking for its like 411 mobile it will even makes calls for you. Its great; all of my friends even went to purchase them one. I took it on vacation with me to a place I've never been before, I was everywhere I needed to be and on time thanks to my new GARMIN Nuvi. The FM Modulator works pretty good, but it sounds better when its direct. If you have one of those tape adapters it works great, but it takes away the reason youre spending the extra money for the 660.. It just depends on how many FM stations are in your area interfering with the signal. The external speaker sounds great, I even use it when Im out in the garage its like a portable boom box. There really isn't anything to complain about except for the price, but its well worth it to me.. 

$$;
Pros:. screen display, design, easy of use, mp3, bluetooth, street names and favorites read out, traffic alert. 
Cons:. voice guidance, fm transmiter. 
Summary:. Here is how I was able to "pair" my samsung phone SCH u540 with the nuvi 660.. The key is to simultaneously connect your phone and the GPS. In other words; set your phone to connect to the GPS after it has discover it and at the same time set the gps unit to connect to the phone. Both units at the same time. That worked for me, however the voice command does not work.. On the other hand, I found a big advantage to receive traffic alerts through the fm transmitter rather than through your phone, but as for playing the music in your car speakers I was expecting a clearer reception and the navigation voice I just don't like it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, set up and download updates. 
Cons:. none at this time....... 
Summary:. Bought the Nuvi 660 on Friday, Updated the software to 3.8 right off the garmin website it was easy. Spent the last two days putting it through the paces.. Sound quality was fine no complaints. I missed turns on purpose to see how quickly it would reroute me, very fast. Tried using it through the FM radio and it worked great.. Mounting it on the windshield or the dash mount is easy and sturdy. So far very pleased with the purchase. Got it at SAM's Club on special for $499.00 regularly $599.00. I can't wait to take it on some longer trips.. Everything so far has worked as stated in the documentation. I would recomend it to anyone looking for an outstanding GPS navigation System. Rating it a 9 because I do not give 10's out... 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, easy to see, clear voice turns, took us around a traffic jam.. 
Cons:. I have trouble sometimes with small road destinations.. 
Summary:. We would definitely buy the Garmin Nuvi 660 again and would recommend it to everyone!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, large display. 
Cons:. Charging Options. 
Summary:. I've had this for about a month now and am very impressed. this is my first GPS, so am learning to use it for the first time. It's been simple to figure out the menus. It took a couple of times to figure out how to enter addresses, but now am familiar so the learning curve is pretty much over. Saving addresses as favorites is very useful.. I travel to different cities for my work. So, when I start it up after flying into a different city, it takes a couple of minutes to find the satellites. Once it does, though, it's up and running.. One fun idiocyncracy: the default voice says the word "recalculating" in a very disapproving voice; the subtext of which says, "You Moron!" My friends get a kick out of it, and so do I.. The charging options are a bit dissapointing. You can't charge the battery from a USB cable. This is hard on me, because I carry enough adaptors as it is and one more AC adaptor, no matter how small, is too big. And the cigarette lighter adaptor plugs into the suction cup mount instead of directly into the unit. That means I have to pack the mount, too!. If you're going to buy a Nuvi 660, SHOP. I found mine @ Costco.com for $500.. Good luck to you all!. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate, large bright screen, simple to use, solid feeling and loud. 
Cons:. No on screen off button, can't save tracks. 
Summary:. Got it to drive cross country in my car, but mostly to use on my motorcycle. With medium loud pipes I can still hear it. The Screen washed out about 50% in direct sun light while riding, but with my sun glasses on I can still see the screen. Which I would consider great. Major wish is that it saved tracks so when I'm on one of those rides to no where I can follow the tracks back.. 

$$;
Pros:. Should have bought one sooner.. 
Cons:. Can't bypass roads that I don't want to use.. 
Summary:. I have had my first Nuvi 660 for about four months. I say first because I ordered a second unit for my wife today. I didn't think we would use it as much as we do. It has been very handy to get us to locations without a hitch. My only dislike about the unit is that it won't elminate certain roads. I have it set to "highways only" and it picks up one road that is a dirt road on a reguarly traveled route. The graphics are great and the voice directions are an added dimension. The bluetooth works great and connects to my phone when I power on the GPS. The MP3's are a nice addition although it works better in some vehicles than others. I bought antennas for two of my cars thinking that I would need them where I wanted to mount the unit. I don't need them! I have almost a full signal and the antenna is within one inch of the metal roof of my car and a couple of inches back from the windshield. It will even work inside my home almost all of the time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen, very light weight, accurate, wind shield mount.. 
Cons:. Blue tooth does not work with all phones. 
Summary:. I am about to move to Dallas and start a new job that has 20 something different locations. I was terrified to start a new job and in new city. This device has taken a large weight off my shoulders. It is extemely easy to use. Just turn it on and go. I will never get lost again. It mounts securely to the windshield and is removed from the mount is one second. You can also remove the suction cup just as fast. The traffic program works well, although I currently live in Houston and it seems the entire city is gride-locked. The screen is beautiful and very responsive. Audio is loud, but not good enough to listen to music through. The only problem I have is with the bluetooth. I have the LG CU-500. It was easy to pair the phone with the Nuvi, but it does not transfer the phonebook. There is no way to manually put the phone numbers in the Nuvi. So when I get a phone call, it just displays the number. Despite that, it is really cool to make a phone call via the Nuvi, especially if you have the audio through the FM transmitter. The FM transmitter is weak, but I live in forth largest city in america so there is some channel on every setting. I have found every location I have looked for in POI database. The 3D view of the map is amazing. It looks exactly like the roads that are ahead of you, plus it displays the next street name long before you can see the signs. I bought it from one of the websites listed on c-net for 560. That's 300 dollars cheaper than the store. I can't wait to use this in Dallas!. 

$$;
Pros:. Form-factor, display size, bluetooth. 
Cons:. Routing not great as Magellan. 
Summary:. I've played with several GPSs and also researched the net and though it's not a perfect unit (but what is?) it's a great unit available. And I got it at a bargain from Costco as their father's day sale for $499 which is $100 below what you can get it anywhere. Plus their return policy allow me to return it anytime for a full refund including S/H so I'm actually getting no-questions asked extended warranty which you usually end up paying another $100 or so.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen, bluetooth, robust GPS, light weight. 
Cons:. Slow update on next turn screen. 
Summary:. Very easy to use and lightweight and slim. Nice packaging and eash to use interface. I found the Bluetooth to my phone eash to establish and it works well. The screen is big and bright and easy to read. Are there a few things I would change? Yes, but nothing major. Some have complained about the lack of a "next turn" direction - and I agree it would be nice. But it tells you which way you will be turning and you can hit the next turn icon to get more info if required. I have never found this to be much of a problem.. Sattelite acquistion is pretty fast and robust. Never lost signal. I even tried it on a recent flight and was able to track the flight by holding it near the window. Fun to watch the "ground speed" and see where we where flying.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, great phone clarity through bluetooth, accuracy of directives/rerouting great.. 
Cons:. None that I've found.. 
Summary:. Honestly, I don't see anything wrong with this GPS device. What exactly are people looking for in these? Do they want their GPS to talk back to them too? I read thousands of reviews before choosing, and it took a long time to commit because I couldn't figure out which options I definitely wanted and those I could do without. Then, once I figured that out, which review do I agree with? These negative reviews on high rated products like this one must be the competition. It seems made up.. So, I broke down what I wanted based on a high rating by CNET. Then, I took those and decided what options I wanted in a newer model. A bigger screen size, text to speech functionality, bluetooth capability, and accessories should include AC adapter, car charger, USB cable and good windshield/dash mount. Those are hard to find in one package. The Nuvi 660 fit the bill and it hasn't let me down. I searched online for a reliable website/good price and I feel it was well worth the money I spent.. Hope this helped people having a hard time choosing like I did.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1] Compact and light; 2] Vibrant colors; 3] 4.3 inch screen; 4] User-friendly interface; 5] Clear and loud voice commands; 6] Screen does not wash-out in sunlight. 
Cons:. 1] Battery life was disappointing. Fully charged, the unit lasted for about an hour. However, I was constantly interrogating the various functions in this unit at the time; 2] continued below..... 
Summary:. Cons continued: 2] Bluetooth doesn't work with my Verizon Wireless LG VX 8300. In fact, the Nuvi bluetooth works with only certain cellphone models; 3] FM tuner is highly overrated. Lot's of static comes through the car's stereo even if you are able to find an unused FM station. This should not be the selling-point for potential buyers.. I must admit that I am a novice in the world of GPS. I did my homework prior to buying the Nuvi 660 and I have to say that I am very pleased. I live in Fairbanks, Alaska and even in a remote place like this I found the map and Point of Interests (POI's) very accurate. Maps of Europe is available for purchase from Garmin; but I was disappointed to hear that it costs $299! However, this doesn't take away from the fact that this is a great GPS unit. Finally, I purchased the bean-bag dashboard mount (aka friction mount). I was skeptical at first, but sure enough this bean-bag holds the Nuvi in place even during sharp turns. I would like to give the Nuvi 660 a 10 but the short battery life and inadequate bluetooth forces me to give it a 9.. 

$$;
Pros:. User Friendly, Accurate, Great Display, Clarity of instructions. 
Cons:. Doesn't support multi stop trips very well, but there are work arounds.. 
Summary:. Some of the negatives I have read here on this site must be from competitors or people who are from another planet and have tried to use it there. Here on the Earth, and in the good old U.S.A. portables don't get any better, nor do most built ins.. I have owned mine for two months and have been all over Southern, Central and Northern California. This has yet to fail to get me where I want to go.. The accuracy varies, depending on the area and the specific destination. Garmin and Magellan use Nav Teq as the Navigation engine which is the best one for the U.S. Nav Teq is not 100% consistent in its accuracy. It is more like 98%. If your destination is in a parking lot, over 100 yards from the street, it may conclude that you have arrived about 200 feet before you have. If the destination is on the street, you can expect accuracy withing 10 - 20 feet in most areas. Remote areas will be less on the spot. Keeping current with upgrades is important, since our country is a work in progress, with new homes and streets being built every day.. The user interface is very intuitive. Even if you don't read the user manual, you can probably fully utilize it.. Clarity of instructions is important. It is the most important thing besides accuracy. This device has text to voice, with a human voice and it mentions street names. Not only does it mention street names, it also will give you multiple instructions if you are to make a left and then a quick right. It will say "Turn right on Main Street and then left". When you have turned right on Main street it will immediately say "Turn left on Pine Street". When you are on Freeway interchanges, it gives you specific and detailed instructions on where to be ("Bear right to Interstate 5". If you follow the voice and the display you won't go wrong.. It has a 3D view and you can zoom out to a point where you get a graphic of several miles in every direction, but when you approach a decision point it will zoom in and show you exactly where to go, using a white arrow superimposed on the route.. The bluetooth works with virtually all bluetooth enabled phones. I have not used the MP3 or books on tape yet.. Traffic is free for the first three months and then it costs about $60. It is worth it even though it is not perfect. There are some false alarms, but that is not the fault of the Nuvi 660. It is the fault of the traffic service. But it is still worth having.. Routing: You can choose the fastest route, the shortest route or off road. You can elect to avoid highways and toll roads. That's it.. I gave it a 9, instead of a 10 because it isn't perfect. I wish it showed parking, gas stations and banks on the display. It has plenty of points of interest but these are menu accessible. It does break down restaurants by type which makes it easier.. Over all, this is probably the best unit on the market at this time. This market is constantly changing, but as newer better devices are available, the price of existing ones drops. This unit is currently selling as low as $700 at some places.. There it is.. 

$$;
Pros:. Where do I start?. 
Cons:. None thus far. 
Summary:. Bought 2 weeks ago and I couldn't be happier with it. The GPS movement seems simless when navigating. Love the voice prompts-they are also very accurate with only 2 mistakes that I can remember so far. I was a little nervous because of the price but that is no longer the issue. A great investment that I do not regret. I bought my 660 at www.triggerandreel.com because it was a reasonable price plus atthe time 10% off and i did not have to pay shipping costs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. The Cost Price is kind of High. 
Summary:. Easy to use, the content and the way the information is presented on the device make it simple enough for any on to use. 

$$;
Pros:. Locks in GPS in 15-30 sec's....suction cup sturdy...accurate map's and POI's.... 
Cons:. No remote, FM transmitter is ok. 
Summary:. Bought the unit from BJ's Wholesale Club a month ago for $749.00. It's had solid performance. I was able to pair up my Spirt A-900 Samsung cell phone and my Cingular 7920 Blackberry. The FM transmittor is OK but when i use it in my wife's car w/ the fm attenea integrated w/in the glass the quality greatly improves...The MP3, Language translator, and FM traffic service are pretty cool. Overall I'm happy wi/ the unit...Just wish it came w/ a remote.... 

$$;
Pros:. Everything is intuitive, navigation is intelligent and works without flaw. 
Cons:. Nothing yet. 
Summary:. OK, so 3.5 years ago my wife bought me a Magellan 500 with a 4 year warranty. Two weeks ago it died and Best Buy simply said "go ahead and pick any replacement for the equal value I paid for the Magellan". Well, 3.5 years ago the Magellan cost $900 and the Garmin cost $899 so I just went ahead and bought it. I, of course, did some quick research on my Treo web browser at Best Buy and just went ahead and bought it.. Well, I was and am absolutely delighted! It's amazing how easy and full-featured this GPS is. The Magellan was a nightmare, took forever to locate, and really wasn't user-friendly. This Garmin does everything it says it does and all well.. Good luck. Hope this helps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large, bright screen; FM transmitter to listen through car stereo. 
Cons:. Expensive; need to use power adapter to enable FM transmitter so you can listen through your car speakers. 
Summary:. This is my fourth Garmin GPS, and easily the best. I travel extensively throughout the US in my job, and I rely on the Nuvi to get me where I'm going. It just never lets me down.. The screen is large, bright and very readable. The map information is excellent with very good graphics quality.. The included FM transmitter is better than I would have thought, although the cord needs to be fully extended for it to work well: a bit sloppy but not a show stopper. The FM transmitter is important because the speakers on the 350, 360 and 660 are very tinny. They're OK for navigation instructions, but pretty bad for books on tape, and especially music.. When I rent cars I usually try to get one with an axillary jack. That way I can use the headphone jack on the Nuvi that pumps everything through the car stereo without the need for the power adapter. Absolutely awesome! I've got everything I want on a couple SD cards and no longer need to carry my Nano and Griffin Roadtrip in order to listen to books or music!. The Nuvi automatically stops whatever content I'm listening to in order to give navigation directions. It also backs up the content a couple seconds so you can come back to whatever you were listening to without getting lost.. The Bluetooth paired effortlessly with my Verizon 8703e Blackberry. I set the phone to automatically accept the Nuvi's request to connect, so every time I get into the car, the phone is ready to use. According to callers, the quality is excellent. I wish I could upload my phone book and enable voice dialing, but those are issues with the Blackberry, not the Nuvi. If those features existed on the phone, they'd be usable on the 660.. This unit isn't inexpensive, but I think it's worth the money. A good GPS alone is in the $400-$500 range. Add in the MP3 and Audible Books player, along with the currency converter and FM transmitter, and I actually think it's fairly priced. I found that a simple CNET search can get this unit for $700.. Lest you think I threw my Quest, Nuvi 350, and Nuvi 360 in the trash, I have found there is a pretty active after market in Garmin GPS'. I never had to do anything but let the word out in my office that I was trading up to a newer unit and my older unit was gone within the day.. If you are someone who travels a lot and is looking for a really full featured GPS, this one comes highly recommended from an experienced GPS user.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, 3D view, bluetooth, mp3 player. 
Cons:. battery life, can't save routes. 
Summary:. This is my 5th GPS and 2nd auto GPS. I had a Magellan 700 which was stolen from my car at Christmas. I started to just get another Magellan but after researching, I decided on the Garmin Nuvi 660 and I am glad I did. First of all, the larger screen is great. The names and lables are much easier to read and the 3D map mode is much easier for me to follow. A friend got a new Magellan 2000 and it is a nice basic unit, but the NUVI is much nicer. I think the Garmin has newer map and POI info than the Magellan. I had just updated my Magellan and even so, the Nuvi lists resturants, highway exits, and other POIs that the Magellan did not have.. I did not think I would care about the Bluetooth phone link, as I already had a bluetooth hands free kit for my phone, but the Nuvi is much better and easier to use. I bought the microphone and it works great. People I call do not know I am using a speakerphone.. I put a 2 GB SD card in it and have been using it as an MP3 player in my car. This works great, but if you have a good stereo system, just keep in mind that low bit rate MP3s will not sound good.. The unit will not operate long on the battery so keep it plugged in..

Pros:. LARGE SCREEN, EASY FOR BABY BOOMERS TO SEE. 
Cons:. EXPENSIVE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;& gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. 
Summary:. I HAD THE 350 SOLD IT ( BECAUSE IT WAS HARD TO SEE AT NIGHT), AND GOT THE 660. ITS WONDERFUL FOR US AGEING PEOPLE THAT NEED READING GLASSES, IT MAKES FOLLOWING A ROUTE A PIECE OF CAKE, I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT...... 

$$;
Pros:. My non-techie wife learned to use it quickly and now.."won't leave home without it!". 
Cons:. A bit pricey if you don't need or use all the extra features.. 
Summary:. I checked out several brands and sizes and the 660 was my favorite. Bought it for $750 from BJ's and the big electronics store right next door had it for $900.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very responsive interface. Nice display. Nice integration of features such as bluetooth, and traffic monitoring. 
Cons:. Sometimes suffers from a case of stupid. 
Summary:. I love this GPS. The tracking is accurate, and can I get a strong signal even in bad weather, and going through short tunnels. The 3D view is handy. The traffic monitoring is a life saver! You have to judge for yourself though. Sometimes the Nuvi notifies me of traffic along my route which isn't at all severe enough for me to want to route around it. You have to get use to how it reports traffic, and why. Nuvi has saved me a lot of time by finding genuinely bad traffic jams and routing me around them (or notifying me of them, and I re-route myself). But a couple of times when routeing me around traffice the Nuvi has sent me on ridiculous routes that actually took longer to go through than it would have taken me to sit in the traffic jam. Mind you, I live in NYC and travel in Brooklyn and Queens where the streets are screwy to begin with. Navigating them is complicated even for a human. You may have a better, or worse experience depending on where you use it. The moral of the story is know your roads. Nuvi will help, but don't trust it to always send you along the best route. That's true when it routes you around traffic, and when it's just routeing you from point-a to point-b. If it weren't for those occasional stupid (and we're talkin' STUPID) routes, I would have given the Nuvi a rating of 10. However, Nuvi has always gotten me to where I want to go; and usually does so over a pretty good route.. I like that it can display pictures. Sometimes I will download sattelite images of my destination (if it's a place I'm not familiar with), load it onto the memory card, and bring it with my GPS. It's good backup if you're going somewhere complicated and unfamiliar because it can be helpful to see the lay of the land. I don't use the Nuvi for MP3 playing very often, but when I have it works pretty well. There's intermittent static using the FM transmitter, but not bad enough to ruin the experience for me. Another reason I like the Nuvi is it allows me to insert a "via" point. If I want to get from point A to point B via a particular bridge rather than the interstate Nuvi wants to send me on, I'm able to do that.. Finally, I dig the bluetooth integration. It works very well, and it's incredibly handy. I don't know how I lived without it. I've been able to pair the Nuvi with my Blackberry, my Treo, and 2 of my friend's Motorola phones. Pairing always worked without a hitch.. If you've got the money you should get the Nuvi 660. The price tag may look crazy, but this is a really high quality GPS; not just because of its features, but because of how well the device works, and how reliably all of its features work.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very sophisticated, yet very easy to handle. 
Cons:. No cons yet. 
Summary:. We are happy with our Nuvi. Suddenly our world got bigger when you see what is around. Today mi wife does not simply leaves the house for shopping, without consulting her Nuvi. She took ownership of the thing, so I may have to purchase a second one.. Advise: Do not share with your wife, else you'll loose it!. 

$$;
Pros:. User Friendly, Big screen, great directions,. 
Cons:. Doesn't include maps for europe. Available for buying but very very expansive. You will need subscriptions for any extras garmin offers.. 
Summary:. Best GPS in the market. I love all the features.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large Screen size, easy to use, and everything you need. 
Cons:. A little pricy, bluetooth connectivity. 
Summary:. Great maps, and very easy to use. This is the GPS on steriods! If you want the best personal travel assistant gps advailable, look no further. I have never gotten a complaint from this GPS ever. And i can not count how many i have sold. All i have gotten is Rave Reviews. One little thing i have gotten a complaint on is the Bluetooth integration, but once you learn how to use it, it is simple!. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. 
Cons:. battery life a little short. 
Summary:. It took a while for me to part with the $$$ for this unit. I figured I would put it on ebay if I did not like it. After the first day of use I decided it is a keeper, no way is it going on ebay. It is extremely accurate calculating arrival time, it is great for picking up traffic problems and suggesting alternate routes. I would highly recommend this unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Portable, EZ to read, EZ to use. Nice big buttons. Bluetooth handsfree that can be used through car speakers!. 
Cons:. I found the price to be high, but fair.. 
Summary:. First and foremost, I wanted a GPS. The fact that it has a nice handsfree bluetooth is an exceptional benefit.. The GPS is easy to use, large screen with ability to see up coming turns and maps at same time.. There are but a few negative reviews, I read them all and found them poor reviews. One did have solid CONS in reference to a remote. In deference to the negative reviewer I did not give this product a 10. But one would be justified. 800 dollars is peanuts is a fair price. I bought mine at Sams. Oh, and if the display freezes, try the reset button, mine froze out of the box. But fortunately, I always read manuals completely before touching the electronic gizmos...... 

$$;
Pros:. Clarity, Screen Size, Portability, FM transmitter, Integrated Traffic Receiver, Bluetooth Capable, Spoken Streets, Great Design. 
Cons:. Price, Battery Life, May Obstruct Visual Field, Minor Map Inconsistencies. 
Summary:. Seeing past the price tag of this unit is the beginning of seeing its true potential. I will honestly say though that if you dont care for the FM transmitter, never use traffic implications, and dont even know what Bluetooth is, youd probably be better fit with a steal-of-a-deal Nuvi 350. However, for those that strive off of the advancements in technology, make no mistake&this is your GPS unit. It incorporates almost everything into it that I could even fathom to ever want while on the road...ever. The slightly larger screen is a nice addition as well, assuming that its not going to be a visually blocking distraction. I have a feeling that its price is about to level off for a good amount of time though, sitting pretty steady at about $700. Pricey? Maybe a little...but look at its competition. Considering that most factory GPS systems can easily be 2-3 times that much, it makes me wonder why they arent taking lessons from Garmin yet. Id still take this GPS over all factory systems Ive seen to date (Lincoln, BMW and Lexus). Id recommend the 660 to anyone looking for the ride of your life&and how to get there too. If you'd like to read a much more detailed review i've written on the 660, check it out &lt;a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_294340693636"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use A 10, Great Color Screen. 
Cons:. None at this time. 
Summary:. I have purchased many electronic gadgets over the years. This product delivers the goods, very pleased.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size, Ease of Use, Worked right out of box, Light and easy to transport. 
Cons:. Price, No multi-segment route planning, Sometimes it doesn't recognize that you really have arrived at your destination and wants you to go another few feet instead of automaticaly figuring this out. 
Summary:. My wife has a 2005 Acura with Navi and the Nuvi 660 blows away the Acura system when it comes to ease of use. I haven't found anything that would make me regret buying the 660. It is a great little machine.. 

$$;
Pros:. very easy to use. 
Cons:. The only thing I disliked about the unit is it didn't always give the best route and the map for some areas are inaccurate.. 

$$;
Pros:. size, features. 
Cons:. battery life. 
Summary:. I planned on buying the 350 last summer and I am glad I waited. I was concerned that the larger size wouldn't be as portable but I can't imagine the device being any smaller!. I LOVE the ability to scroll through the directions turn by turn in advance to starting the drive. In response to the reviewer that said it doesn't show the next turn on the map 1) it tells you which direction the next turn is and 2) by touching the bottom right corner of the screen you can see the next turn info.. The only flaw I have found so far is the suction cup mount won't stay attached to the window.... 

$$;
Pros:. Great user interface, Love the FM traffic reports and rerouting.. 
Cons:. A bit pricey.. 
Summary:. I have been a Garmin GPS user for many years. I still have my Vista and don't plan on getting rid of it. The Nuvi line is excellent, my dad bought the 350, however I wanted the bluetooth, and FM traffic reports so I went with the 660. This unit has EXCELLENT satelite reception. You won't be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wide screen, audio quality, nighttime visibility. 
Cons:. None significant. 
Summary:. Found this online the first week it came out while looking for the Nuvi 360. Was fortunate enough to find it at a sale price lower than the 360 so I purchased it. After 4 weeks the unit has worked flawlessly in providing directions. Bluetooth connection paired seamlessly to both my Nokia E61 and Cingular 3125. A great GPS unit. 

$$;
Pros:. Portability, Ease of Use. 
Cons:. Some excessive direction prompts. 
Summary:. The review seemed off on a couple of points. buy.com sold it for $720 and this model includes the traffic receiver with a 90-day subscription included.. The boot up time could be faster.. Several times, it asks you to stay left or right on the same interstate you are on for say 30 miles, just because the name or classification of that portion of the interstate changes.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Display, Feature Set, Power. 
Cons:. Little Pricey, Nav options are not quite as flexible as more singularly focused units, battery life could be better, FM transmitter could be more powerful. 
Summary:. This is my third Garmin (GPS V, Quest) and certainly the most advanced, feature-rich unit I've owned to date. Its manufacture is very high quality, beautiful display day or night and very fast computational power.. I really like the features wrapped around the FM transmitter (bluetooth speakerphone, MP3 Player) but I do wish the transmitter was stronger. Relative to the Sirius radio that sits right next to it in my car, its weak but acceptable.. Overall - it really is a tremendously useful unit. The few times Ive left it out of the car I felt like I had lost a part of the dashboard itself. One particularly nice feature is the Traffic Info and Rerouting - simply put...it works and Im a big fan!. If you're interested in the best unit out there for your car....you've found it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great unit, compact, user-friendly, useful outside of the car, good screen.. 
Cons:. It's expensive.. 
Summary:. After having tried the Magellan 3050T, I returned it for this model. My primary reason for returning the Magellan was because of a design flaw with the buttons (as I documented in another review), however once I discovered the importance of size, I wouldnt purchase another GPS larger than the Nuvi 660. After having experienced the joys of riding with me and seeing how small this unit is in the dash or window compared to their bulkier models, several of my friends have resorted to selling their own units to purchase either a 660 or the even smaller 350 or 360 models. I think the greatest rating of all a product could receive is when all your friends start trading in their own models for yours after seeing it in action. I would have preferred the size of the 360, but I have large fingers and was worried about trying to press the tinier interface screen buttons on the smaller model.. The 660 is extremely easy to use, has a perfect screen, and catches the satellites in seconds after turn on. The voice commands are a bit robotic, but it uses text to speech conversion (announces street names on guidance instead of feet/miles), so I doubt at this point there is anything better on the market. I tried a GPS that did not use the text to speech conversion, and was occasionally missing turns when two turn offs were so close together that the GPS announcement was worthless. This isnt an issue with the 660 because the street names are announced.. I havent had a great deal of luck with the FM transmitter, but I believe this is because I have a rear mount antenna on my car. Ive read other reviews that the FM transmitter wasnt worth using, and yet other reviews that claim perfect reception. I think it is an issue of antenna proximity and the availability of clear frequencies.. The 660 comes with both a 110 adapter and a 12V vehicle adapter, however the 12V vehicle power adapter does not plug directly into the unit, but rather the suction cup vehicle mount. The mount has a small power interface connector that links to the 660 when the unit is placed into the mount. This might be ideal for certain situations, such as when the power and mount are permanently affixed in the vehicle, but I find it to be a bit of a nuisance because I have to stick the GPS in the mount even when I am just trying to charge it on the passenger seat. Its a very small issue. I wouldnt image leaving the mount in view even if the 660 was not in the car, because thieves could assume a gps unit is hidden in the glove compartment or under the seat when noticing the mount, and might break your window to find out.. Battery life could be a little better, but 3 hours is fair considering it charges quickly, and comes with a 110 adapter for use at home. One thing I really like about the unit is that the GPS automatically turns off when the antenna is folded back, so you can play with the unit (add addresses, browse maps, etc) while at home. Ive tried other models that wouldnt quit prompting for gps coverage, which made them useless for indoor use. The Points of Interest menu is very comprehensive, and includes phone numbers with addresses. While traveling, twice now I have chosen to search closest, and Pizza, to grab a phone number to the closest pizza delivery guys from my hotel room, which makes the 660 a bit of a virtual yellow pages as well. I think Garmin hit it on the mark by calling this a travel assistant, because it is small enough to take with you while walking or riding public transportation, and this model fits comfortably in a jacket pocket. Ive been able to use it to find bus routes and predict the closest stops in unfamiliar areas to tourist spots while on vacation.. You can purchase this unit for $750.00 or less as of 17Oct06 at several online vendors. You pay for quality, but this one has it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tiny form factor, intuitive interface, responsive satellite tracking, gorgeous bright wide screen display, includes integrated FM traffic receiver, excellent Bluetooth integration. 
Cons:. Tinny speakers, lackluster battery life, **expensive**,. 
Summary:. HINT: Thieves LOVE this. Be sure to remove it from your window (inluding the suction mount) and take it with you or hide it in your vehicle when parked. I've had TWO Garmin Nuvi units stolen from my car this year.. Based on what is out there, this is the ROLLS ROYCE of portable GPS units, with a price tag to match. That being said, don't pay more than $750 for it new, anywhere. Many places on the web, including eBay, sell this item new for that price often with free shipping.. I've owned the Garmin Nuvi 350, and had it stolen twice. It was my favorite gadget of all time, hands down. When Garmin announced the upcoming widescreen Nuvi 660 with integrated Bluetooth, FM transmitter, and included FM traffic reciver, I ordered one. I have not regretted it. The overall appearance, design, form factor, and usability of this device is only rivaled by Apple's iPod, in my opinion.. To be blunt, I prefer the smaller form factor of the Nuvi 350 and 360 units. The 660 is a widescreen unit and is slightly thicker as well, which goes against the industry-leadnig portability established by its predecessors. However, the screen seems to have been revamped and is VERY bright and easy to see. As a matter of fact, it handles direct sunlight without washing out any of the display. At night, I keep it at only 20% brightness. This makes it less visible in my peripheral vision as I am driving, as well as saving the short battery life. So far the unit averages about three hours of battery life after a full charge, with the WAAS/Egnos feature turned off and the display dimmed somewhat to conserve on power.. The user interface is the best out there: simple, robust, and responsive. The mapping is excellent, and the Google Map-style drawings are both beautiful and functional. It powers up and very quickly picks up the GPS satellites. You can load your custom points of interest as well. One of the neatest features I have seen is that it will display your Bluetooth-enabled phone's contacts right on the Nuvi display screen as if you were looking at your own phone.. As far as durability and quality, there are no concerns. Garmin makes excellent, well-tested products and the Nuvi is no exception. I've dropped my device several times already without any damage to it.. BOTTOM LINE: Very highly recommended.. HINT: If you want to avoid highways, you can go into the Navigation options under "avoidances" and tell the unit to avoid major highways. I do wish that Garmin would make this option easier to set instead of having it embedded in three levels of menus, but at least it has it.. 

$$;
Pros:. slim design, bright touchpad screen, sd card slot for extra storage, easy menu guide, sensitve gps antenna, mp3 playback, fm transmitter. 
Cons:. mp3 playback has limited settings (no playlists or eq setting, etc), suction cup for windshield mount comes loose once a month, car charger plug too long because of traffic receiver that i have no use for. 
Summary:. i do love my 660 though it does have some flaws. a good aspect is it always has signal and always gets me to where i'm going. my wife has an invion 3v4 which is always searching for signal which is very frustrating untill i grab my 660 from my truck and off we go with no worries of signal or the long lasting battery. it is absolutely a gps first and foremost but some of the add on features are nice, just need some improvements.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good features, user friendly. 
Cons:. haven't noticed. 
Summary:. For the short time I used it, I was happy. When you're in Orlando, FL, this is a must have!. Angel. http://www.FearlessIncome.com. 

$$;
Pros:. great display, accurate. 
Cons:. downloads, speakers, power sucker, and satellite. 
Summary:. Great for occasional usage, but don't count on it for everyday use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Top Value for amenities. 
Cons:. Sometimes slow w/ directions. 
Summary:. Used around the SF bay area mostly though used throughout NorCal and SoCal occasionally. Pretty much perfect in NorCal. In SoCal it's another story. It would sometimes give confusing multi directions and at the last moment clarify direction and almost cause a missed exit or merge. And yes, I listen carefully and even travel w/ co-pilot. All and all, very pleased. I let the traffic feature expire, but if I lived in SoCal I would have this feature!. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Ease of Use, Great Display in All Lighting. 
Cons:. Map Updates Too Infrequent. 
Summary:. After owning this unit for nearly a year, I have only one issue with it and that issue is with Garmin. They only update the maps once a year. I have also found major streets that I know have been in existence for over 5 years and they do not show them. Come on Garmin, even Google updates their maps more often than once a year!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice large screen. Overall good directions.. 
Cons:. Garmin needs to work on the liguistics a little more. Searching for store locations over 100 miles away and not finding the same store 1 mile away occurs on a regular basis.. 
Summary:. Good overall GPS Unit. As with all vehicle GPS Unit technology today, the next generation will be better and get the bugs out. Price is a little steep, however the only alternative is a Megellan. The others are not worth looking at for what this unit offers for its accuracy and features.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pretty Good. 
Cons:. Pretty Good. 
Summary:. My friend got this at an after christmas sale. It's pretty much the same as the 350,just more voice options and more maps and better views, not worth the $1000. I'd say $660, hehe.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has bluetooth for phone support, Nice easy to read bright screen, Voice guided directions, MP3/Audio book, Very good satellite signal most of the time. 
Cons:. Expensive, doesnt work with all cell phones, built in destination database limited, sometimes the GPS gets "lost". 
Summary:. This is a very solid unit with tons of extra features. The main problem with this unit is sure, it has tons of extra features like bluetooth support for cell phones and MP3 music playback BUT most owners of this device who shell out $800 for it are likely not to use these "average" features. I have yet to use the MP3 playback feature because I have a deck that hooks up directly to my 80GB Ipod, and the limited space on SD cards just doesnt give me a reason to dump the ipod for the GPS playback. Also I have owner 3 phones since I've had this GPS, an iphone, blackjack and a cheap Sony Ericcson. Surprisingly enough the only phone that worked with all the features on this unit was the Sony, the blackjack only supported phone calls and not text messages and I have yet to try the iphone. Personally I prefer my bluetooth headset when I'm driving. So I like many owners of this device bought it only for the GPS function. It does a fair job at it, I'd say 3/5 of the time when I punch in an address it leads me to my destination correctly but there is those times that I end up somewhere completely different. When looking for nearby gas stations, restraunts and other businesses it finds them about half the time. The other half of the time it leads me to an empty parking lot or simply cannot find it at all. For the money I personally expect a much better GPS unit, the other features are nice and there might be some people out there who use them but I personally do not and I expect the GPS feature to work much better. I took the unit from where I live (Oklahoma) to Boston and on that trip it was great. We set major cities we planned on stopping in as destinations then plotted in side stops such as fast food and gas stations. It got us there and did a fair job at finding locations but for the price I expect much better than a "fair job".. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, tiny, great features. 
Cons:. Satellites slow to be found occasionally. 
Summary:. Well, this is my first GPS device. So it's hard to rate it. I should really give it a 10 I guess, but I have nothing to compare it to. I LOVE the thing! Works great. Tells me where to go when I travel. One funny thing it does is in the state of Washington, when I'm on a WA highway using the female Australian voice, it thinks WA is "Western Australia." So I'll be on maybe highway 520, and it will be referred to as "Western Australia 520." Gotta love that! Put in the name of a business you are looking for, and it will find it. Amazing little machine.. 

$$;
Pros:. mapping software. 
Cons:. bluetooth, poi. 
Summary:. i never got the blue tooth to work with myiphone. the poi's are not up to date as my tomtom 720 has almost twice as many. 

$$;
Pros:. Large clear display. mpg, mp3 and aa players w/ FM transmitter. 
Cons:. Added non-navi functionalities not robust enough to replace other devices. 
Summary:. The 660 is the first GPS unit Ive used or owned.. A month ago I found out that there are no subscription fees for reading from the GPSs that support these devices (Duh). This knowledge, coupled with my life-long inability to recognize up from down, let alone north from south, convinced me to immediately buy.. I looked up the specs and read both professional and user reviews on a dozen or so models.. It quickly became apparent that many of the units had features unrelated to navigation. I wondered if any of them incorporated telephone, music and video capabilities. I sat down and made a list of what my ultimate all-in-one unit should have. Here is that list:. 1)	Large screen with clear display. 2)	Spoken directions, including route names like, Turn right onto Maple Street.. 3)	Western Europe as well as USA maps. 4)	Hands free cell phone. 5)	MP3 player. 6)	Expandable memory via SD or similar cards. 7)	DIVX, AVI support. 8)	Long life (10 hour) rechargeable battery. 9)	AC / DC / USB chargers. The user guide is something like 75 pages and does not ship with the unit. It is available on-line in .pdf format. It would have been much nicer if Garmin shipped a right-sized and bound manual. A bit low-rent on their part.. The 660 has a decent-sized clean display in an easy to carry package, complete with a leather carrying sleeve and pocket, an AC charger, USB cable, auto power take-off and windshield suction mount.. There are 3 levels of map detail that can be set  basically, city names, rivers, route numbers, etc. detail. The more detail the longer the unit takes to draw the screen. For me, the more map detail the greater my comfort level. The draw-rate was not so slow that I was frustrated. It never crossed my mind to reduce the detail to increase the drawing speed, so a non-issue for me.. The display can be zoomed in and out and there is a 3D rendition setting. You can touch the screen and drag the display up, down and around pulling what had been off the screen into view - instead of having to zoom out to see what had been off-screen.. WAAS is available and was spot-on accurate when in use while on a two week vacation in the Bad Lands/ Mr. Rushmore/ Deadwood/ Devils Tower area (upper Mid-West of USA). We made a game out of how accurately the 660 positioned us. Kind of fun but this level of accuracy has not been necessary to date (vacation in Bad Lands, 2 weeks in the greater Charlotte, NC area and a trip from Houston to Brownsville, TX).. The time to destination is displayed on the map page but distance to destination requires use of the touch screen.. The map is displayed with either a white background or a black (night) background.. A nice feature, especially after the sun sets.. You can only create two stops on a planned trip  the final destination and one intermediate stop.. There is a trip simulation that can be optioned and run without having to acquire the satellites.. The unit can recalculate a route on demand and will recalculate if a turn is missed.. It does not allow the user to make  to my knowledge  up-front route exclusions.. Fastest, shortest and off-road settings are available. I used the off-road setting when at 30,000ft. Pretty cool being able to identify the geographic features we were flying over and in knowing the current speed and average speed. (Fastest speed reached between Charlotte and Houston was 405 mph). You can load a Favorites list using post office addresses (USA), or long. and lat. in both hours and minutes or in decimals.. There are optional ($) services that provide language translations, traffic alerts (first 3 months free) and special discounts.. The spoken directions are available in something like 20 or so languages with 2 male and 2 female voices in English (UK and American English). TTS is available, which provides for route names to be spoken like, Turn right on Maple Street as opposed to just, Turn right. This is the normal TTS so the sentences sound robotic. Think of the computer in War Games  Hello professor Faulken, do you want to play a game? The non-TTS voices are more natural sounding but again I prefer the warm and fuzzy of having the route names called out as I go.. The 660 has a built in FM transmitter, so if there is an FM frequency not in use the Nuvi can be set to that frequency and the vehicles FM radio can pick up the signal and play it through the vehicles stereo system. Otherwise the built in speaker can be turned on. I prefer using the cars stereo but it was a bit problematic in both the greater Charlotte and greater Houston, TX areas - as what were originally station-less frequencies picked up broadcast stations 5 or 10 miles down the road. I also found that the closer the unit was placed to the cars antenna the better the reception. Just a couple of inches made a significant difference. Ive experimented using several rental cars and have found that antennas incorporated right into the windshield worked the best with this Nuvi.. There are two volume settings  one in configuration and the second a quick option, accessed by pressing the power button twice and then pressing a + or - on the screen  each tap adjusts the volume up or down by 10%. To achieve an adequate volume level, I found that I needed to option the configuration volume setting at 100% and then, depending on the ambient noise, option the quick setting somewhere between 70% and 100%. This quick option would be better if there were a physical wheel/dial on the unit that controlled the volume.. The unit is Bluetooth capable and supports Blackberry products, at least the model I have, calling in my phonebook, displaying last number called and received. It also allows me to switch from hands free to my Blackberry if I need to, like when I park at my destination and leave the car.. I believe I read that there are over 6M Points Of Interest included in the USA maps. At first I thought a feature Id never use. To the contrary, Ive found gas stations, hotels, restaurants, national and state parks - most of them complete with telephone numbers. A simple push of an icon and the number is dialed.. The built in microphone worked well from the front seats (too much external noise to be effective at 65mph from the back seats).. The 660 supports custom POI files with a free loader available on Garmins site. Ive also seen a couple of self-guided-tours on the web with freeware creation software. Basically, you drive to the coordinates and the POI file kicks off, complete with audio and .mpg files. Ive looked at a file created for the battles at Little Round Top (Gettysburg, PA, July 2-4, 1863). The 660 is also an MP3 player, supporting .mp3 (and only .mp3) and .aa files. Since Im a subscriber to Audible, the support of .aa files is a great feature. The unit supports external memory (SDs). I purchased a 2GB card and loaded it with music and audio books. Windows XP, via a USB connection, sees the 660 as two drives if you have installed an SD card. You simply create an MP3 and AUDIBLE folder on each drive, if not already there. The Nuvi software will look across both drives. Here is where the FM transmitter and use of the vehicles stereo system is a big plus over the Nuvis internal speaker. And as stated above, a physical volume dial would have made more sense than software navigation and setting. Because of the awkwardness (and the potential danger) of re-setting volume levels (taking your eye off the road) you should probably normalize the volumes of your music files before moving them onto the 660. The mp3 player does not have an equalizer which it certainly needs  especially if you are trying to leave your portable mp3 player at home. And it only scrolls in ascending alpha sequence, though it does read the file tags and hi-level sorts by title, artist, album and genre. It is just not quite robust enough  though with a bit of software development it could be - to replace my existing mp3 player. Im not sure how long a battery life it has if using it solely as a player. Ive yet to take it across the Atlantic (9.5 to 10 hours for me). I had no power issues on a 3 hour trip from Charlotte to Houston and this with the navi system turned on the entire way.. The .mp3/.aa file that is being played will be suspended when navigational directions are given and then resume at the point of suspension once the directions are complete.. There is a headphone jack. When it is used both the FM broadcast and the internal speakers are cut off.. The 660 supports .mpg files and has slideshow software. The software supports zooming, rotation and touch and drag.. The unit does not support video (DVD, DIVX, AVI or any of the other movie formats). I hope that a future release of the software will have a built in video player if possible, as the screen resolution seems to support it - evidenced by the clarity of the .mpg files. Storage doesnt seem to be a problem with the use of SD card.. -- a feature rich device that could be a whole lot more.. 

$$;
Pros:. does the fm transmitter allow phone service through the car stereo?. 
Cons:. cannot find answer to this, guy at best buy had no clue.. 

$$;
Pros:. Portable &#38; easy to use, form factor. 
Cons:. Can not plan a route with waypoints. FM transmitter not strong enough for some applications.. 
Summary:. Picked mine up from Costco when they were on sale for $499. I have used my 660 all over the country and it has not steered me wrong yet. I enjoy the bluetooth and the FM transmitter for playing mp3's a lot more than I thought I would. While not perfect (as you can read in others reviews)it is a wonderful unit that will serve my needs for a long time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent form factor, and interface. Fast recalculations. 
Cons:. Missing track logs, improving/editing of lat/lons, fragile plug, infrequent data updates.. 
Summary:. The Nuvi 660 is a fantastic product but it is missing a few essentials. First, it does not record a track log; therefore, you cannot see where you have been. A track log is very handy when youre on roads that are not in the Nuvis database such as jeep trails in the national forests. If you make more turns on these roads than you can remember, youll not get any help from your Nuvi to find your way out. Another example is looking for real estate or cruising a new subdivision where its nice to know where youve been, or to upload your traveled path into another product such as GoogleEarth or other mapping products. Second, the Nuvis address lookup and geo-referencing does not always produce an accurate locationnot Garmins fault as buildings are not always built where geo-referencing rules say they shouldour office plots .2 miles from its actual location. The shortcoming here is that once you save the location to your favorites, there is no way to improve or edit the lat/lon, so for those addresses that do not plot accurately then theyll always be wrong in your favorites. My third observation is that the tip of the 12v plug on the charger is made of plastic which can break (Ive broken one). Its important to insert the plug directly into the receptacle and remove it the same way. Any lateral force during insertion or extraction can break the tip leaving you with whats left of your batterys life. Last, is that more frequent updates of map data and points of interest are needed. These data are well out of date by the time Garmin provides updates. Overall a great product and I'd buy one again even with these omissions.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to navigate once you get used to it. 
Cons:. Costly updates and add on's. 
Summary:. I would however suggest all consider this one above most others. 

$$;
Pros:. Thin, light, loaded with features, great signal strength. 
Cons:. No auto sort for multi-destination trips. 
Summary:. I did a bit of research before deciding to get a TomTom 910. Then, after the TomTom failed to even work once, I decided to research a little more. Turns out that the Garmins cost a lot more if you just run out and buy them from the major retailers, but if you search websites like Froogle.com and BizRate.com, ect. you can find them for around the same price as the competitors.. I personally paid $570 for my Nuvi 660 delivered overnight, and love it.. Anyone can read the fact sheets about it on garmin.com and see if it has what they're looking for; it's the minor issues I've had that I think you want to hear about.. Most glaring issue to date is that this unit even with the up-to-date 2008 map set did not have a large section of major highway in Raleigh, NC (Rt 540). But I did a look around web based mapping sites like maps.google.com and noticed that they didn't have this section on their maps, either. Weird, since according to the locals the highway has been open at least a year.. And, again in the Raleigh area, there is a lot of development going on, but some stores and restaurants that have been in business over a year still aren't listed by the device. These businesses are on the google map site. But from what I understand this is a problem all GPS's face in one form or another.. I would have really liked to see Garmin put the auto sort feature in this unit. It would stand to reason that their new premier unit should offer this. At least the 670, and 680 versions, anyway. Hopefully this is a simple software fix that can be added in the future.. Another small annoyance I have encountered with this unit is that as you spell cities and streets, ect. the unit doesn't darken the letters that you won't need to finish what ever you're typing. This unit does jump to a list of possibles as soon as you've typed sufficient letters for it to narrow down to no more than 3 (at least that's the most I've ever seen) choices. I'm not sure what this missing feature is called, but I have seen it on other Garmins, specifically the StreetPilots. Something else I hope they will fix with the next update.. I've noticed that I either don't know how, or you just can't view your route and destination once you've started it. This can be annoying. And it seems that the "Arrival Time" in the bottom left corner of the display can not be changed to display another facet of your trip such as distance, or time left to go. But if you touch it, it shows you the virtual dash board, which can be handy.. The food/lodging ect. folder could use a Misc. category for things like hair salons, and electronics stores (I.E. Radio Shack, or Best Buy), or anything that doesn't fit into any of the other categories. I have to type them in (however, typing in the type of business you want usually results in acceptable results so you don't necessarily need to know the name of where you want to go). And if you hit done after only typing some of the name or type it will show a list of possibilities saving you some typing.. So far these are the few gripes I have with this unit. Not enough for me to consider them a deal breaker.. The good things about this unit are that it is so slim and light that taking it with you when you get out of your car is actually an option with out having to carry a bag. It fits in my pocket perfectly.. The user interface is pretty straight forward, and easy to learn.. I have noticed very little glare even in the brightest sunlight.. Putting it on, and taking it off of the base is very simple unless you continue to forget the antenna must be raised to do this, like I do. At first I thought the antenna was unsightly, but after using it a few times I decided to push the antenna down against the base after installing it, and it works perfectly fine and you can't see the antenna.. The RF transmitter and MP3 player come together beautifully to play my music (I bought a few 1gb SD cards and made up some play lists) over my car stereo, and then pause the music to let me know when my next turn is coming up. This way I can play the music as load as I want without worrying I'll miss my next turn. There's also a headphone jack (3.5mm) on the side of the unit for you to hook it into your stereo physically if you have an Aux input.. Over all I am glad I bought this unit. I think I would have been slightly disappointed if I had paid the full MSRP, or Best Buys even higher price for this unit, but for what I did pay I got a lot for the money.. I have been recommending the Nuvi 360 to friends and family due to it's similar feature set (it ONLY lacks the FM transmitter) and it's slightly lower price. The major reason I choose the 660 over the 360 was screen size.. The best lesson I took from this experience is DO YOUR RESEARCH. And, be willing to wait for it to be delivered vice purchasing from the major retailers to save a lot of money! These two rules apply to most major purchases, I've found.. 

$$;
Pros:. Portablility and large bright screen. 
Cons:. Battery could last longer. 
Summary:. I just started a job that is about 75% travel and recently got this model, even though there are newer ones out now. I didn't need the msn features of the newer ones when I can check those things with my smart phone. I took it out to Brunswick, FL and an Island community just East of there and it worked like a charm and got me everywhere I needed to go. So far I can say that I like it a lot. I'm a beginner at GPS's.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large, clear display, decent voice instructions. 
Cons:. Doesn't always select best route. 
Summary:. First let me explain that this is the first GPS unit I've ever used, so I am not familiar with GPS capabilities in general. So, some of what I consider its shortcomings might be the same for other systems as well.. I read these reviews and was thoroughly confused by the wide disparity in user ratings. However, I ended up buying this because of the high review from the CNET editors and the many high opinions expressed here, plus I felt I couldn't pass up the deal at Costco.com -- $499. This is absolutely the cheapest price I've seen this unit.. The good: The 660 is easy to set up. The small start-up brochure works fine and there is a pretty decent user manual on the CD. The large display is bright and intuitive. I was also delighted to find out that the Bluetooth works great with my LG VX5300, even though that was NOT one of the compatible phones listed. I was pleasantly surprised to see how well it paired and that the address book was automatically downloaded to the nuvi -- a feature I didn't know about. I was also able to successfully hook the nuvi up to the FM stereo as well as load MP3 and jpeg files and download free custom POIs from POI-factory.com. The voice (I am currently using the British male) isn't bad at all -- except he pronounces "West Edmonston" as "Wes Ed Monster".. The disapointing: While I set my preferences to fastest route and to avoid traffic, Mr. Wes Ed Monster always seems to find the route with the shortest distance but usually the one most traffic lights, instead of the highways. They are routes I would never choose. He also directs me to left turns that either have no light, which makes it too difficult to turn, or not allowed. He doesn't seem to know that you can't turn left on certain roads.. I would like to be able to tell him to get to a certain point by taking a specific route which I know to be faster or more scenic, but there is no easy way to do this. While I can program in one stop as a via point, I can't just say use Route x instead of Route y -- I have to specify a specific location -- which is not always easy to do.. I wish one could do the following:. -Specify a specific road/route you want it to take.. -Manually enter the route to get from A to B (for example, if someone tells you the best way to get to his house) and save it -- then let Mr. Ed read me the directions instead of calculate it his way.. -Record the route one is taking.. -Save the calculated routes.. -It would also be nice to be able to enter more than one destination with one vua oiubt, However, I have figured out that I can save multiple destinations as via points and then just select the next one when I arrive at a destination.. Allow you to "pause" the directions -- for example, if you decide on the way to your destination to make a detour to see an attraction -- without it getting all upset and trying to get you back to the road he wants you to be on.. I don't know whether any other GPS unit handles any of these functions.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth works great. 
Cons:. None that I could find. 
Summary:. The best one out there by far. Customer service is a-1.. 

$$;
Pros:. I can instantly find the nearest Walmart all across USA. 
Cons:. does not give reliable directions.... 
Summary:. I can't decide whether I should love my Nuvi 660 or think I got cheated. I drive a semi and have always used Microsoft Streets and Trips for finding my way to my shippers and recievers. It was generally trustworthy (only one egregious error have I found) but it was impossible to do routing work while on the move and there was never a way to say "take me from my current location to where I just told you I want to go." Thus I bought the Garmin Nuvi 660. It does several things well like allowing me to find the nearest Walmart and it takes me right there after I hit the green GO soft key. But it does not allow me to search for an interstate exit number and set it as my destination as would be needed to say get me to the next Flying J fuel stop.. Also, when searching for a city as my desired destination, the normal drill down routine of selecting a state and then spelling a city is not used. Instead I have to spell the city in almost its entirety ( and I have no choice between querty and alpa key pads) (please add this Garmin!!!) because the program is looking at the entire USA and then searching through all like named cities until I find the state I want. So for example, I'm driving across texas and I search for Houston. The choices that pop up are 1)Houston, AL 2)Houston, CO 3)Houston, FL, 4)Houston, GA, 5)Houston, ID 6)Houston, IL 7)Houston, IN 7)Houston, KY 8)Houston, NE 9)Houston, NC 10)Houston OH, 11)Houston, TN 12)(and finally)Houston TX ...the list goes on. Since Nuvi 660 displays these four search results to a page I have to go through four pages to get to my desired result even when I'm sitting in a parking lot in New Caney, TX. Now Nuvi 660 knows where I am because when I first hit the cities soft key it searches for the closest cities and number one search result is Woodbranch, TX 0.4miles South.. I expect more from a $850 dollar unit.. I drive with both Streets and Trips and Nuvi 660 on all the time. I use 660 for instant on the move directions and they are generally reliable with major exceptions. But I always use the big picture map on my laptop from Streets and Trips to double check that Nuvi 660 isn't sending me up a river without a paddle.. Example. Going through San Antonio, TX yesterday to get to Houston, Nuvi 660 sends me along I-10 through the heart of downtown but mysteriously tells me to do a U-turn and go back the other way. Now, after years of reading paper maps I'm smart enough to look at the big picture on Streets and Trips and continue on eastward on I-10. Eventually, when Nuvi 660 runs out of ways to recalculate how to get me back to that U-turn by taking the next exit and then the next exit, etc. It finally figures out that we actually can get to Houston by staying on I-10 and correctly recalculates a good set of directions.. This kind of directions error would be merely inconvenient in a car but is unacceptably dangerous in an 80 foot long tractor trailer combination.. I think the Nuvi could be a fantastic tool if Garmin would let me take one of their programmers over the road for a week to show them what works and what needs refining. Call on me PLEASE Mr. Garmin.. Robert.

Pros:. Crisp widescreen, pretty good directions, easy BT setup. 
Cons:. Not thrilled about traffic receiver, Daniel (my navigator) can't pronounce things right, no video playback. 
Summary:. I paid $799.00 for this thing at Christmas 2006. I should let you know that as a result of an old court case where I was owed restitution (long story) and 1 day before I went to buy this I received a final. payment of $587.60 + a $150 happy holidays gift card from work, I only shelled out 'out of pocket' about $110 at Best Buy, including tax.. I use this thing a lot. I use it in New Jersey, New York City, and driving to and from D.C. In terms of navigating, I give it a 8.5. No matter what, a person will know the local roads and shortcuts better than any navigation system. The best route to the closest interstate is not the one the system. recommends and there is no way to tell it "Hey, if you are ever going to send me to the interstate from my apartment, send me MY WAY not the way you like." It should be able to do that.. The BlueTooth setup was non-existent. You literally turn the BlueTooth on the nuvi and on your phone and boom, the address book, call logs, connection is there immediately. This worked with my BlackBerry Pearl (greatest phone ever).. It isn't customizable enough. It should allow you to run a wizard of personal things. For example, it should ask questions like: Which bank(s) do you belong to? Then, when you click 'Where To', you can say, MY BANK. What is your preferred gas station? I have a Shell MasterCard and I want to go to Shell if I. can. And as mentioned before, it should allow you to program preferred routes to certain things.. The traffic receiver is good, not great. There are a lot of highways here and a lot of bloody traffic. The updates are generally late, not accurate of the level of traffic, or just plain wrong. The updates rely on Clear Channel and they aren't fast enough. So, I use 1010 WINS traffic to tell me where the clogs are, then use the device's detour function to get around the traffic. Else, the "Bail" method when seeing traffic is also great. I ues this a lot when on local routes that have exits every half mile or so. Just get off as soon as there is traffic ahead and the nuvi will reroute you in front of the. traffic 95% of the time.. MP3 player, photo viewer, calculator, translator = Worthless so far. I haven't used these outside of peeking at them, nor do I really find a good use for them. If this thing played videos, it would be awesome because it takes external SD cards and it would be SO easy to load up a movie, TV show or whatever to watch on the nice bright widescreen while on a flight, train, or while driving to your impending doom (not recommended).. City driving with this thing is ok, but in NYC, knowing the lay of the land is way better. When driving on an avenue there is no way for the device to keep up with the rapidly arriving streets. What I mean is. that streets come so quickly that the device struggles, when driving 30+ mph, to keep up and you often miss the turn. The good thing is that the device does do text to speech, which lets you know that you will have to turn at "Forty Second Street" instead of "Turn in 300 feet" so you don't have to mind the device and can instead look at the street sign. Also, in the urban jungle, it may lose signal which is bad when 38 Bangladeshi cabbies are honking non-stop for you to move your butt.. There are a few very, very annoying things about this device. I frequently turn on 'John F. Kennedy Dr.North' which Daniel so eloquently pronounces, "Turn right on John F. Kennedy DOCTOR North." IDIOT! An $800 device that can't recognize 'DRIVE' instead of 'DOCTOR'. I wrote Garmin a concerned email about this, they replied "Duly noted" or some other cookie cutter reply. He also does it with "Turn right at Canal St" where. he will say 'SAINT' instead of 'Street'. I mean, are you kidding me here? And I'll tell you what, paying that much and not having him be able to pronounce things right really chaps my behind.. The suction cup mount is noted as a pro because it isn't bulky, it is very solid, and doesn't require the power cord to be plugged into the device, but instead into the mount. This is better than other devices that require a power cord to go into the device, which means that each time you enter the car (assuming you put the thing in your glovebox when not in the car) you have to plug the power in. This thing allows you to plug the power into the mount and then quickly click the device into the mount. I like it a lot.. In summary, I really like this thing. I don't ever want to be without it again as I hate driving out here a lot of the time. It's been a blessing on the way to and from work getting around major traffic headaches and also for finding new an interesting ways to get around. I would mention that I would not pay full price for the 660 when the Garmin Nuvi 360 is far less money and does basically everything the 660 does except the built in traffic (which I don't really like that much anyway) and the widescreen. I think the 360 was a couple hundred dollars less at the time I bought the 660.. 

$$;
Pros:. Boots very fast, Clear screen, better sound, never lets me down, ever.. 
Cons:. low battery life, cant get a clear sound out of the FM radio, $999 and no remote cntr for. Traffic info not always accurate. usless extra fanctions like photo, mp3 and all that. gives me about 15 met. 
Summary:. dont get me wrong. it's a great unit and there are many good things about it but i wish they improved a bit as the price i paid i would expect more from it.. again, wouldnt buy anything else.. 

$$;
Pros:. Idiot-simple to use. 
Cons:. POI's are often outdated. 
Summary:. It's fascinating how after a boatload of positive reviews, someone comes up with a 1, 2 or 3 and REALLY detailed reasons why. As if the others' experience is somehow invalid because theirs was poor.. One could say it's a common tactic of someone working for a less-than-ethical competitor; but often, someone working for a less-than-ethical competitor will stack the reviews in favor of the product, too.. As is, much of reasons for the negativity presented so far does not represent the typical user of this product at all. Some seem to expect the machine to think for them.. It can't. Common sense will always prevail over technology.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen; good text-to-speech; intuitive design. 
Cons:. Routes not always the best, or the most logical. 
Summary:. The Nuvi 660 has a nice touch screen and is loaded with information: you can find restaurants, hotels, etc. easily, and it has nice features for getting you where you want to go. No twiddling with dials, and nice clear maps. Do you need an mp3 player with a tinny speaker? Probably not. I doubt that many people will use the audio book option as well. As for the picture viewer, it loads the pictures so slowly that you wouldn't be able to hold the attention of anyone long enough to show off your dog, kids, etc.. One feature I have used is bluetooth: it connects seamlessly to my cell phone, and has even downloaded my entire phonebook. It also has an fm transmitter, making it possible to send all audio to your car's fm radio. Of course you buy a unit like this for navigation and the Nuvi will always take you Home. It may, however, do this in a suprising way--here in Boston, for instance, it seems unaware that the way home to Cambridge from the airport is via the very fast turnpike, and instead suggests you go a circuitous route through town. (Yes we have it set right.) It is not so good at planning a long trip, either: you get only one intermediate stop, so you need to plan shorter hops, and that makes it harder to use some of the other nice features, such as a total time meter, average speed, etc. That being said, the Nuvi 660 is easy and fun to use, and it feels like good insurance that will make sure we will never get lost. If they got rid of some of the extraneous things and lowered the price it would be even more attractive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple, intuitive interface. 
Cons:. Poor mounting options;. 
Summary:. The design of this device is incredible -- it is so easy to use, unlike so many tech products today (they clearly kept the programmers locked and chained in the basement, and let the product designers control design of the interface.). However as others have mentioned, the Points of Interest database may not be the most stellar. The first two things I looked for were not there: one of the most popular and longstanding fastfood Chinese restaurants in Boulder, and the University of Denver arena.. The suction-cup window mount is just scary though -- how can that hold in cold weather, etc.? And will you have an accident if it suddenly falls off while you are driving? (They are illegal in California.) The only supplied alternative is a permanent-stick disk that still requires using the suction cup. Car Toys told me there is no alternative mount available, and that I'd have to commission a custom one. This needs to have a suitable detachable mounting option that does not involve a suction cup. But apart from the mounting issue, the device itself is awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen Size, Brightness, Ease of Use. 
Cons:. Fastest Way Are Not Fastest. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS, I came to buy this product by researching for weeks for best on the market for price ($350)and technology. First off I bought this for my motorcycle. Even though it's not made for motorcycle riding due to out door elements like rain, I bought it anyway thinking I won't be riding during rain days.. The PROS -. (1) Screen 4.3 pretty descent than the motorcycle Zumo 550.. (2) Ease of use, wasn't very hard at all to learn this, didn't even use the manual very much at all.. (3) Gets you to your location very well. (3) Can insert one P.O.I after calculating a route.. (4) Bluetooth is cool, I can see whos calling (I can't pickup call on my Harley it's to loud for me to listen or for them to hear me unless your in a car. LOL). The CONS -. (1) Can use custom routing. the fastest routes are not always the fastest. I say that because in my own area (NYC) I sometimes like to see which way it would take me and I know they are not the best, cause it can take you on some street roads with to many lights. I over come this on long rides by knowing which direction I prefer to go then use GPS for exact location.(This can depend on your settings FASTEST, FAST, SLOWEST). (2)Points of interst are outdated, I tried 2 or 3 gas stations the GPS told me are near by and they were out of business (This is pretty much a complaint on all GPS). (3) Need to change screens to see your distance and data while traveling.(which I toggle back and forth, no big deal). (4) Estimated time changes when stop happens on the way (GPS does't know really, but a good guess). 

$$;
Pros:. Size, geographic accuracy, features. 
Cons:. Loose use in city, not able to designate route. 
Summary:. This GPS has made a big difference in my ability to find remote addresses and relieve the stress that Mapquest caused if a route detour. But, use it in a big city with tall buildings and it cannot track the satellite - NYC is a disaster. Also, no easy way to designate a route e.g. Tappan Zee Bridge. Don't know of a better unit, but there are technology flaws - for now.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was great a year ago.. 
Cons:. It came out a year ago.. 
Summary:. Hasn't anyone heard about the 700 Series?. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to view, loud audible voice, well built. 
Cons:. No Volume control, Bluetooth only works with certain cel phones.. 
Summary:. This is a great unit. Very easy to operate and gives great performance. I purchased this 660 for the Bluetooth function instead of the lesser model with all the other same features. The Bluetooth is very limited as to what cel phones it will work with, my expensive Samsung SPH-a920 does not work with the 660. This was very dissapointing and I could have saved close to $200 by buying the lesser unit without the Bluetooth feature.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, Total Traffic Network (sometimes) accuracy when puttting in address. 
Cons:. Data base (where a store is) and some nic picking navation things. 
Summary:. This is my 3rd 660. To be honest I owned a 350 before and I liked it and it got stolen. There were things I liked about the 350 better. When you got off the road with the 350 it knew you were off the road and displayed it. The 660 map still positions you on the road going in the direction you were going in before you got off. Let's suppose when you were on the road you were heading north on main st. You pulled off into a gas station in the gas station you turned south the navagation still has you heading north on main st. (not such a big deal but when you have no idea where you are it can get confusing. when you still need to navagate. The 350 was better in that area.. Another feature which is weird and this happened with both units and I think with the 350 as well. is let's suppose you were travling along a highway. and you decide you want to travel on the service road. unless it's far enough the gps will still think you are on the highway when you are on the service road. Basicly in time it will figure out you switched roads (going in the same direction) but not for a while unless the distance is far enough in between. If your not a complete idiot it's not such a big deal again. You can turn it off and back on while driving or program it again and it will re position it's self.. The Data base is not perfect. While I was in Orlando on vacation I wanted to go to sears the data base took me to an outlet mall and there was no sears. The number it told me to call was the main corporate office in chicago. If anything frustrates me is the Data base and I had this in the 660 and the 350.However in Tennessee (near nashville the Data base was great. In Florida it's ok. So it depends where you are.. TMC Total Messaging Center.(traffic notifcation) WELL I'M STILL LOOKING TO HIT A TRAFFIC JAM DURING OFF PEEK HOURS. It says traffic jam but i never hit one and i'm very disapointed. I hate traffic but now I'm dying to hit some to proove that I was correct in buying this. I think I should of went with another model with Satalite traffic. There is another network out there that is compatable with the 680 called MSN direct But I read nothing but complaints about it. ( but thats no suprise it's Microsoft). If you are not an obessive complusive like myself that owned 3 of these units plus went to walmart to test another 350 while I had the 660 all in all if you are normal it does the job getting you place to place. The accuracy where to turn right and left and how to get to (an address) is great) The Data Base should be improoved for the money but there are some correct things on there and it did help me find some of the places.. I did not compare this to other manufatures execpt one I had in the 1999 when I had an alpine unit built in that acually took disks and didn't have a tough screen but did have a remote. That unit I turly loved. That was acurate to the T and I really want that type of unit back. But I don't want to spend the money right now. For my work (a comptuer Tech that travels everyday to peoples houses and businesses to fix the comptuer) this does the job and would recomend if you are not a nicky picky like I am.. Thank you all. Greg. 

$$;
Pros:. Readability, Handsfree, Traffic. 
Cons:. Price, FM transmitter, Route Control, POI Database. 
Summary:. The unit is good for what I wanted the most. It has a large easy to read screen, some amount of traffic info, and hands free cell capability. But it is less than wanted in less important areas. The POI database is missing a lot of stuff. I have found out that this is a money making thing with Navteq where if a store does not pay then it does not make the map. I also use a Garmin 60csx where with mapsource you can set up compicated routing. I would think that could be an easy sofware fix. The FM transmitter is about what you would hear with an IPOD FM transmitter. Maybe it works great in some cars but not in my volvo. Lots of background noise. So I will probably keep the unit but I would have felt a lot better about it if it had all of those features or was about $200 cheaper.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to setup, easy to use, clear screen, calculates (and recalculates) directions very quickly. 
Cons:. Internal speaker stopped working after a few months, wish it had more disk space, traffic indicators could be better, included car charger doesn't fit. 
Summary:. The Nuvi 660 is generally great.. I was able to use it for a road trip from NY to Boston within a couple of days of receiving it. Riding with friends who knew the Boston area, the Nuvi 660 steered us towards the exact same roads my friends had known and would have also used.. Startup of the device is fast, and it picks up satellites very quickly. Once you enter the destination, it calculates very quickly. When taking detours or trying to avoid traffic, it also recalculates very quickly. It did try to take me down the wrong way on a 1-way street one time though. But that has only happened once. I was also looking for a nearby McDonald's once, and it took me to someone's house instead. It didn't look like it was (nor would it ever have been) a prime McD's location. But again, it's been pretty good with other POI's. Directions have otherwise been very accurate.. Downloading music to the device and other custom POI's was very easy. But, I wish there was more storage available. I was only able to get a few dozen MP3's on to it before running out of space.. The free traffic trial was nice, but not always accurate. Using color coding to indicate if traffic was heavy (yellow - moderate, red - slow, heavy traffic), it would often show red on the current road when traffic was moving okay. Then again, it is the Long Island Expressway and NYC roads it has to deal with which are packed 90% of the time anyway. But, I wouldn't recommend subscribing to that service.. For some inexplicable reason, the car charger they included doesn't fit the device. I called customer service, and they had no explanation, and they didn't offer to send me a replacement one.. The sound directions from the internal speaker are clear. Sound from the car speaker was so-so, but I don't really blame that on the Nuvi as it's tough to find a channel with zero interference.. For some reason, after a few months, the internal speaker stopped working. Customer support had me try all kinds of resets, but we couldn't get it working again. I had to return it to Garmin in KS, and they had it back to me within a week (but I lost all of my MP3's, POI's, and favorites) and it's working again, but I still don't know why the speaker stopped working. I'm just hoping it doesn't happen again outside of my warranty period.. I'm generally happy with having chosen this model, but be weary of subscribing to the traffic service, make sure your car charger actually fits, and keep an ear out on the speaker.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright screen, good directions, bluetooth works well. 
Cons:. Cannot get POIs to show on map. 
Summary:. The 660 seems perfect out of the box. Simple effective navigation, bright easy to see day or night screen, easy bluetooth connection with my Motorola Q. It even gives you access to the address book on your phone via the unit. Also, the cigarette lighter adapter has a FM modulator on it that allow you to route the audio through the car stereo. Great for listen to mp3s that you put on there, but more importantly, gives you better sound when making hands-free calls.. I like the unit...don't love it. Here's why:. 1) POIs are not displayed on the map. This is a problem because sometimes you want to know where something is in relation to where you are. I maybe spoiled by in-dash navigation units. In an in-dash unit, if I looked up macDonalds it would just plop icons for all the Micky D's in sight on the map.. Imagine you only shop at a certain grocery store. You go to a different city and you want to go that grocery store. On this GPS you search the name and you get a list of the stores, each with an arrow pointing it's direction and the distance it is away. That's fine if you know where you are but if you are on say Interstate 40 in NC, the fact that exit ramps have you doing u-turns, wraparounds, and such, distorts perception of how to get to the place if you can't see it on the map. Also, you have no quick way of deciding which of two places to go, since you can't see them on the map in relation to where you are. On the way home from work, I would never turn around and go 1.5 miles to the store just cause it is the closest according to the list (traffic backs up pretty bad). I'd rather go 3 miles to the next one if it doesn't make me back track.. 2) Adding "Waypoints", favorites or whatever you want to call them is SUPER EASY on the unit. However, this whole business of using Mapsource to create points to show up on the map hasn't worked for me. I installed the version from the Garmin website, and it gives me a message that "MapSource could not find any istalled MapSouce map products" and doesn't open. Any help with that would be appreciated.. 3) The last thing is that you have to hit "back" way too much. There should be a "view map" and "home" icon on every screen so that if you are 7 clicks in, you don't have to hit back 7 times to get back where you started.. Overall, I still like it and it beats the pants off the Magellan 4040 I took back and exchanged for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. good on simpler routes. 
Cons:. bad routing sometimes. 
Summary:. I had a iterny, where the GPS gave an option of 17 miles, 18 minutes for the shortest path. and 12 miles and 21 minutes for the longer path.. It would have made me travelled 40% extra for the shortest time.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice size screen. 
Cons:. doesn't show clock and speed while in use. 
Summary:. after intering favorite or address, too many steps getting back to main screen. 

$$;
Pros:. Many features included. 
Cons:. Many features included some mediocre. 
Summary:. While this GPS unit is overall very good, it is not such a performer that it should be considered great considering its high cost.. Some deficits I found are: low audio output on the internal speaker; Traffic data coverage range not as advertised by provider; Low/fair audio output and quality from the SD drive when using FM radio transmitter; Sometimes it seems the unit does not give enough notice when to make a driving decision, ie when to exit, etc., especially in heavy traffic unit give only 0.8mile notice may not be enough time to act on directions.. 

$$;
Pros:. NIce layout, great size and screen. 
Cons:. Why only A-Z keyboard -- not on any computer or smartphone. 
Summary:. This is a really nice unit but how can anyone in this "modern" age not provide an interface that is inline with what is the standard for data entry - a QWERTY keyboard. Tomtom does in all its models. It offers you a choice of A-Z, QWERTY or AZERTY in the preferences menu. I am sure there is not one employee of GARMIN that has an A-Z keyboard, at their computer or on their smartphone, so how could they make such a grave error in judgement. If your out in the field holding the nuvi in your hands thumbing is the most common method for entry like on your Blackberry, Treo or smartphone. Using an A-Z keyboard is a tedious non-intuitive task. It is as though Garmin had no idea who the end user was going to be. The solution to this problem is to have the software team code in these other keyboard choices in the preferences section and provide it in a downloadable software patch. As this is only a virtual keypad on the screen anything can be accomplished with software. Seemless evolution of a product is vital to its utility and success.. 

$$;
Pros:. compact,easy to use and read.. 
Cons:. not flexible, hard to navigate, hard to update maps. 
Summary:. Got it from costco for $550. Up and run after few minutes. Easy to setup. Does not take street names well, unless it mapped to its data base. Adding new destination along the way is confusing. No "back" button once you are at that menu. No external mute button. Map updates 1 a year and has quite a few old info. Very confuse and hard to update map. Voice prompt is slow, need to look at the unit to track for turns.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big bright display, multiple viewing options, good voice directions.. 
Cons:. User documentation and on-line support is the worst I've experienced from any major vendor.. 
Summary:. Tried to download a map update using my "Lifetime" card. The Garmin website reported (1) the updated is already downloaded-- it wasn't, and (2) The ability to download expired March 17-- some "lifetime". Two hours into phone support finally revealed that Garmin arbitrarily is enforcing expiration dates because of issues with server capacity-- without giving any indication that that's what they're doing.. 

$$;
Pros:. good display / good features. 
Cons:. too slow to alert befor turns. 
Summary:. This is the best review you will read about this GPS, one year use. This GPS is a safety risk beause it sometimes announces turns while you are halfway into the intersection. You either have to pass by and come back, or try to make a dangerous turns. Yes, an accident waiting to happen. The Cnet review is total crap, and doesn't address this serious flaw. The maps are ok, but the best gps manufacture is Magellan. Better options for routs, much quicker voice promps, better rerout info if you miss a turn. The nuvi is poor to fair at rerouting destination. I short, if you really need to depend on a gps don't buy this, but it is a nice toy if you want to dress up your vehical. Please don't buy this for your kids. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size. 
Cons:. Read the review. 
Summary:. I am comparing the Nuvi 660 to Garmin's c550. The c550 retails for about $350. The Nuvi series of GPS has only one speaker built-in. The volume of spoken directions is not loud enough and the voice is scratchy. The c550 has stereo speakers built-in, the voice is smooth and there is ample volume. The volume control in Nuvi series is via touch screen. In c550, the volume control is on the side.. The touch screen accuracy in Nuvi series is lacking particularly when pressing the keys towards the right hand edge of the screen. In c550, I never registered an incorrect key. If I pressed 'p', I got a 'p'. In Nuvi, I press 'p' and get an 'o'. Though it is not advisable to do so, sometimes, I used to enter addresses in c550 while driving the car. In Nuvi, this is impossible because the keys strokes keep getting messed up.. The bluetooth in Nuvi series is not good. It keeps losing connection with my mobile phone. The c550 had a solid connection with the same phone.. There is one common problem in all Garmin GPS units. The POI locations are incorrect. Whenever I program a POI, the GPS will tell me that the location is to the right of the road whereas actually it is on the left or vice versa. I have used POI function three times and the same thing happened. Now I use the street address of the POI instead of POI by name.. The sensitivity of c550 is as good as maybe even better than the Nuvi. The Nuvi lost satellite connection for about a minute in open air during bad weather. The c550 never lost the connection.. Some Nuvi series GPS have FM transmitter built-in. This is a useless feature since with the FM transmitter activated, the built-in speaker is turned off. The FM channel is so crowded that it is impossible to find a free channel. If you are traveling through several cities, the FM channel free in one city may have a very strong signal in other city.. The c550 is very much thicker than the Nuvi. It has SD card slot, mp3 player with album art support, external speaker connection, microphone input.. Bottom line, if you want to save money and still get a good GPS, go for c550 instead of Nuvi.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, ease of storage and bright screen.. 
Cons:. Can't learn your driving preference, Doesn't always take the best route.. 
Summary:. I first purchased the Nuvi 350. After never owning a GPS system before, I thought that the 350 was fantastic, but had a small screen. I really wanted the bigger screen, so I returned the 350 for the 660 since it hgad the traffic receiver built in. After reading all the negative reviews, I was hesitant on buying the 660, but I did it anyway. I like the wide screen, the brightness and traffic receiver. I didn't need the Bluetooth since I have "hands free" built into my Charger. I really think the Nuvi 350 was more accurate. I wish there were more personalized screen for trip preferences. Shortest route or fastest route doesn't mean the best route. I came down the NJ Turnpike and it kept telling me to go through Trenton, NJ instead of taking me on the PA Turnpike. I just learned to ignore and the 660 would eventually recalculate. I prefer major interstate highway and prefer to avoid local roads while traveling long distance. I believe the maps are about two years out of date too. I didn't need the traffic receiver which put about 150.00 on the price tag. If the simple Nuvi 350 was available in wide screen and less money without the traffic receiver, I would have bought that.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, touchscreen options. 
Cons:. Too expensive $$$; NOT weatherproof; doesn't support mutiple destination routing.. 
Summary:. If like to hike or use GPS with your bicycle or motorcycle, or you are a delivery man looking to create the most efficient routes for multiple destinations, this isn't the GPS for you. You would be better off getting the Garmin Quest or Quest 2.. Garmin would rrrreally have a HOT item if they could combine the long battery life, waterproof exterior, multiple destination routing, and overall versatility of the Quest with the touch screen, and enhanced navigation capabilities of this device in an affordable package (&lt; $500) similar in appearance to the Nuvi 660. Until such time this happens, I'll continue to use my Quest and hope Garmin [or someone else] can develop a product with those features.... 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful, high-res display. Easy to use interface. Great menu system for finding POIs.. 
Cons:. Flimsy case. Lousy speaker. Pointless Mp3 player. POI database is at least 3 years behind even after recent update. Very few navigation preference options.. 
Summary:. I was given a TomTom One for Christmas and I thought I loved it. Navigation was clear and direct. However, I quickly discovered that it lacked a database for common stores such as Wal-mart or Best Buy. I could find the shopping center they were in but of course that would be useless if you're visiting a new area you're unfamiliar with and just wanted to find the nearest Wal-Mart. So, I decided to "upgrade" to the "latest" and "greatest" which is what the Nuvi 660 was supposed to be.. I went into its POI menu and found that restaurants, shops, gas stations, and even golf courses, were all organized into very well designed menus and submenus; something the TomTom was lacking. Everything looked great until I discovered that any store built as recently as 3 years ago wasn't to be found. This, mind you, is after a very recent update. You can load custom POI's in but it's a VERY cumbersome process that only very computer savy folks could do. Consumers beware: There is no way to update your POI database. You must wait for the updates that come out only once a year or every two years for $150+.. In addition, you have very few options for navigation preferences. The TomTom seemed much more intelligent in chosing routes. For instance, I live in Hayward, CA. My parents live in Sacramento. When I go up to visit, the Garmin wants me to take I-680 because it's slightly faster by maybe 15 minutes overall. I hate going through 680 because of traffic and so I take 80 all the way. When I'm driving though, and pass the turnoff to go to 680, the Garmin recalculates and tries to take me off onto sideroads for the next 9 exits so I can backtrack and get back to 680. With the TomTom, it simply recalculates and has me continue on 80 because that's the next logical route.. In short, the TomTom wasn't the complete package and neither was the Garmin. They both have major drawbacks, and when you're spending more than $500 (or $899 in the case of the Garmin) you should expect it to be full featured. Especially when these are the only products your company makes. So, as for me, I took mine back. I expect these companies to make a more well thought out product before I spend the loads of money their asking.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. I can route for faster time better than the Nuvi 660. The "Fastest Time" means city streets and stop lights instead of highways.. 
Summary:. Even in the "Fastest Time" mode, the GPS takes me through city streets and stop-lights. Even when I drive on a highway, it will take me out of the highway to city streets and back to the highway. All additional features do not count if the routing is not efficient. I upgraded the firmware, and it become worst. When I ignore the driving instructions and select other direction, the arriving time is improving. I do not know if other GPS vendors have a better routing alghorithm; all what I know is that Garmin is not too good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great for city driving. 
Cons:. terible for cross country driving. 
Summary:. I purchased it, drove to SD and asked to drive shortest route, it had me driving off the highway then back on, from my hotel in Mount Rushmore, I was 4 mile away, it took me the opposite way, 12 miles later we arrived, it really does not know the diference of shortest or using best route, terrible as to best route, it also during trip a to b I added to find startbucks alonf the way, it found one 11 miles away, and I took the exit, when I arrived at Starbucks, I saw the highway 1 mile from the main road, so again it does not know how to take the least resitance, bad design as to roads, also many missing streets in SD, Nebrasca, Iowa, don't know why but the roads were there and old, I don't recomend this unit to anyone, Mio fared better as to multy destinations in one setting.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great cust service, nice screen, fast calculation, good routing. 
Cons:. Can't change dislayed data fields, TMC worse than useless, Can't override map information, Hefty charge for map updates. 
Summary:. All and all this is a good unit. This is my 6th Garmin GPS and probably my last. I've seen a big decrease in user control in the newer models. Compared with my previous, the Quest, there is no ability to control the displayed fields. You can't have the unit show speed and distance to destination routing. It shows arrival time and distance to next and this can't be changed. The maps tend to ignore the fact that traffic lights slow you down. This and many other map shortcomings could potentially be fixed if only it were possible to enter overrides. It isn't. The TMC traffic seems completely random around NYC. It's wrong far more often then right. Routing with traffic can be turned off but the unit always calculates arrival time considering the traffic info. Garmin charges a hefty $70 for the annual map update. I don't think it's right for Garmin to charge to keep your Nuvi operating at its peak potential. Next it will charge for software updates.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright screen. 
Cons:. Poor audio, poor navigation, outdated maps. 
Summary:. This is the first GPS unit for me. I paired it with a Palm Treo 700p phone and have struggled with the audio pickup. I even purchased a microphone and attached it just behind the steering wheel. I still sound to my caller as though I am in the bottom of a well. I can hear the caller fine though over the FM connection. I am going to have to clip the microphone to my shirt to have it pick up clearly. While I like playing mp3's on it, and even though I live in a rural area, the audio is fuzzy through the FM on the emptiest channel I can find.. I get NO traffic reports where I live, also a surprise.. The maps indicate a capricious and lively sense of humor. There are mysterious signs popping up with numbers on them in vacant fields, roads shown which are not there, and roads not shown that are there. On a trip to Memphis, even though I had good directions from a local resident, I allowed the unit to direct me, which took me the long way to the address, through a construction zone.. The technology is there to keep the maps updated.. I don't know what to say about the poor mic.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim, large touch screen and easy to use.. 
Cons:. Innacurate map, mis-names streets, improper destination given. 
Summary:. For a high end GPS the Nuvi 660's map is not accurate. While testing it in my home town it has told me to turn where no turn was available, destination was given for wrong side of street and maybe a block off in distance. It also has shown me driving on no road when I was definitely on a paved street. It should be noted that I tried two units and both did exactly the same. I also have a Garmin StreetPilot i5 that is far more accurate but not as easy to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen for a stand alone unit, respond fast. map is relatively up-to-date.. 
Cons:. Lack of street detail. 
Summary:. I've used Garmin GPS 18, the one connects to a laptop, it is far more batter than this unit. The only reason I bought this is my wife hate me for carrying a computer. 3D view is nice tough, but it wasted more than a half of the screen on area you will past. In crowed metro area, especially at some place that 5-6 intersections together, which I saw in DC/VA this weekend, it is hard to manage because there is no small street name on the map even I select most detail. Somehow I feel the 4.3 inch screen doesn't contain 20% information than a 3.5 inch that you will find on a less expensive mode.. 

$$;
Pros:. reliability, size, display, memory. 
Cons:. difficult to configure, slow navigation commands. 
Summary:. I just spent 30 minutes performing a task that should have taken 5 seconds. In order to renew my traffic subscription, I had to go my car to connect the device to the receive get a 10 digit code (there are 3 different 10 digit codes that are called the UNIT ID). I had to do this 3 times before I got the right one. Then I could enter the code into the website to pay for my subscription. Once I did that I had to go back out to my car and enter a very long code which turned out to take forever because the code includes letters and numbers and you have to switch keyboard modes several times to type. Once I got the code entered, the device told me it was an invalid code. It will not take several days, since I cannot contact customer service until Monday. CUSOTMER SERVICE IS ONLY AVAILABLE 8-5 M-F!!!. Even more infuriating is that I alreay subscribe to XM radio. Since I already have an XM receiver in the car, you'd think I'd be able to get the XMNav service without having to pay for another XM receiver, but this device cannot communicate with the other.... Furthermore, the maps are slightly outdated and there have not been any updates since April 2006, this is May 2007!! Many of the roads in my area have changed completely in the last year. It gets many of the exits wrong, thus defeating the purpose of the system for me. Also, it is too slow and does not give me enough notice before exits or turns in heavy traffic. I've often passed an exit when it tells me to take the exit. I have all of he currently available software updates for the device.. I will never use some of the the other features such as bluetooth (since I carpool, I do not want to talk on my cell phone through this device). I will also not use the photos, audiobooks, or music capabilities of the device. These seem to be the only difference between this device and smaller less expensive models. If you don't have a use for these things, you are just as well off buying a device for $300 rather than $600+ for this one.. I'm happy with the normal day to day use,but I'm not happy with the keyboard layout or the configuration options which tend to be counterintuitive and difficult to manage.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Features, Larger Screen than Nuvi 350. 
Cons:. Low Sound Volume, Slow Start-up, Outdated Maps/Data. 
Summary:. Cannot adjust sound volume high enough (Nuvi 350 was fine), very slow start-up (well on your way before GPS functional), out-dated maps/database, directing you on roads that have been changed for 2-3 yrs, to businesses gone 2+ yrs, and cannot find new businesses already present 2-3 yrs; often directs you to turn or go inaccurate places (ie, into a guard rail, where there was an entrance ramp 2-3 yrs ago; enter a roadway that you are already on and has been finished for 2-3 yrs; or to exit when you are not suppose to) whether on "faster time" or "shorter distance", is frustrating and time wasting. Doesn't adequately indicate which direction you will be turning (so you can get in correct lane). Online reporting of errors is time-consuming, cumbersome (apparently designed for Garmin's ease of use) which deters accurate updating/reporting of errors. (Perhaps, a dedicated 800# just for this with specially trained "updaters" before large monitors to quickly identify and verify problem area/data with ability to receive email digital photos from cell phones/cameras, illustrating "at-location" map/database errors. It is CRUCIAL, potentially life-saving, to have up-to-date mapping/data! Nuvi 660 needs more timely info, rather than at 12-18mo stretches, another 6+ mos to disseminate to end-users. Could be continuously updated, for ready accessability online. I waivered about taking it back; Garmin needs to pay close attention to consumer feedback/imput, to improve the Nuvi 660. Good features, but in light of high cost and time wasting, not quite worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feature packed, light/portibility, bright screen, fast reroute, simplicity in use, clear voice, secure and easy mounting. 
Cons:. questionable traffic monitoring function, some illogical function design, expensive, no video play,. 
Summary:. Initially I was drawn to the tidy packaging and sleek design, bright screen, and its features. However, after several uses, I started to question some of its ill design and wonder if the engineers has play around with other systems like my Honda OEM.. 1) Traffic monitoring is not that accurate and rerouting often took longer(I haveh a coworker who live 5 min closer to work and we get off at the same time; only to find out it took me 15 min longer to get home) quite embarrassing especially I kinda show off this unit to him.. 2) Some illogical functions. Favorite are listed by distance and no alphabitically which is annoying when there is a lot of address. Only list on turn at a time. Had to clear entire memory just to re enter my my call home number. Does not list miles to desination while driving and estimated time is slow to adjust with traffic condition.. 3) FM Tranmitter works ok, but its kinda tortune playing MP3 on it knowing that you can just burn cd that sounds much better.. 4)Nevertheless, love how well the bluetooth works and how fast the reroute and satellite pick up is. But is have problem picking up in down town LA or in parking garages. The screen is brighter than anything I could remember. The 3D view is new to me, it's fun except I think the display is a bit rough.. Overall, I do not think the price premium justify this feature packed unit because some are almost useless. The mount is compact but secure except the arm is not long enough so I have to mount higher up in the windshield which distract me from driving. I am contemplating wether to pay for restocking/shipping fee to return it or not. I was considering the Cobra unit with real time traffic monitoring and Costco's Plenio 7000 which has 7' screen that plays videos and games. I had to have the Nuvi simply because I thought I would love the bluetooth function but now I don't know if I made the right decision.. 

$$;
Pros:. Read lots of reviews and this was the best value at the time. Easy to use. Could not get FM transmitter to work to listen to it via car. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. Slow satellite acquisition. Between 1 min to 10 mins.. 
Summary:. Not sure if this is a common problem with Garmins or if I have a lemon just by chance. My Garmin is about 1.5 years old. I've used it probably 12 times and already the screen will either lock up after power on or when I make an entry, where I tap, does not match with the selection so I routinely have to recalibrate the display every time I turn it on. Toms Toms have better satellite acquisitions but they are not intuitive or easy to use. Don't know much about the other brands (magellan, etc). Will stick with Garmins but if the next unit is not durable either, I don't know what to say. Oh, and yes, I did update the latest firmware and maps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to navigate. 
Cons:. few 660 add ons. 
Summary:. To add scenic maps to the 660 from the Garmin website, is not going to happen. We'll be updating for sure, but it will be to the Tomcat.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to use and has all the basics. 
Cons:. Fragile case, Map errors, Direction sometimes make you turn the wrong way, and first map upgrade has to be paid for even if present one is out dated when purchased.. 
Summary:. I originally bought this because it had a higher rating the tomtom go 720. After taking it out I noticed how fragile the plastic case looked. I use it to get directions home and it told me to turn right on a corner I needed to turn left to go home. Also many street names were out dated. The old names were being used. Some as old as 5 years ago had be changed. So I went to upgrade the map believing garmin would be like TomTom and bring a recently purchased GPS up to date with their latest map. Nope you have to buy upgrades even if you just purchased a GPS with an old map from last year. returned it. 

$$;
Pros:. Small and portable. 
Cons:. Adapters, poor mounting options, and numerous mistakes.. 
Summary:. How excited I was to get this new device for my work as a real estate appraiser. I have to get to 6-10 addresses in an afternoon, and really needed a GPS. First, the bad....1) Mounting kit is terrible. I mounted to the dash board, but the adhesive lasted only 2 weeks and it fell off. I special ordered from The Mount Guys a vent mounting system that didn't work either since the clips didn't fit the vent (not made by Garmin, though), and can't find another reasonable kind of mounting sytem. 2) Small black adapter is a pain and must be attached each time in order to hook up the cigarette adapter. It doesn't attach and detach easily and is only designed for the dash board ball mount. I popped it off one time when getting out of my car and it dropped between the seats and couldn't find for a week. Can't turn off the antenna with this little black adapter attached either. The cigarette adapter should plug right into the unit without having more small parts to lose. 3) Directions are sometimes ok, mostly out of date or wrong. I used the Garmin to help me find my way to a funeral in Georgetown, in the hill country north of Austin. From Austin, everyone else took I-35 to get to the funeral and Garmin told me to take Hwy 183, which was slower. I've also experienced being told to exit 3 exits early, thinking the device was trying to get me around traffic, only to be told to get back on the freeway again. Trying to find a suggested restaurant resulted in an embarrassing number of U turns with my family laughing at the device. Overall, it usuallly gets you eventually to your destination, although in a round-about way many times. Info as to where to find drugstores, restaurants, etc. is such a life-saver, although very incomplete listing of course. 4) Traffic information is terrible too (just says "Traffic Ahead" and nothing more. 5) Always routes me through dangerous neighborhoods instead of around them, such as through the Potrero Housing Project in San Francisco, where people stood in front of my car and once threw a bottle at the car (redlining is probably illegal even for Garmin). 6) Should have built in XM radio which actually does provide traffic reports. 7)Get tired of hearing "Recalcalculating" when miss a turn because not enough notice was given. 8) Cheap plastic casing. I know someday this unit will hit the ground and break. For $900 paid, I think it should have a titanium or magnesium housing with rubberized corners. Overall, I would say bypass this particular model, save some money and perhaps buy the earlier model Garmin Nuvi 350 which is half the price. The 350 has expansion SD slot for data upgrades, etc, without the useless extra features of the 660 (built in battery, traffic alerts, etc). Still I'm glad to have one, but they really should think through some of the design features before production, but hopefully they will improve the problems with future models.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice looking screen. 
Cons:. POI database outdated, slow processor. 
Summary:. I was quite jazzed to recieve my new Nuvi. We took it on a trip to San Francisco the next day and were suprised at how badly it performed. First thing I noticed is you cannot hear the voice prompts over ambient noise in a new Honda Accord, the FM transmitter is noisey, the turn indications come too late and it frequently takes you to the wrong spot. A resturaunt we selected was found 4 blocks away from Nuvi's directions. This happens about 1 out of 3 times. I'll be asking for a RMA on Monday. 

$$;
Pros:. Satellite reception, screen size. 
Cons:. Multi-point navigation capability, Remote control, Dash mounting bean bag. 
Summary:. This is a detailed review of the Garmin Nuvi 660, which i bought because my Garmin 2720 broke down after two years of rigourous use.. I would recommend a replacement plan to any one who buys this GPS. you never know when these things break down.. Cons :. 1&gt; It doesnt have a dash mount bean bag. i find window mounts too difficult to operate even when you are driving even at slow speeds.. 2&gt; At the price i paid i expect Garmin to provide with a CD of the Mapsource NT Navigator preloaded maps. How is one supposed to enter the waypoints ???. 3&gt; No multi-point routing a very important feature i miss about the Garmin 2720. When i planned a trip to Death Valley national park, i had the entire route programmed into my 2720 and it worked like a charm.. Unfortunately no such feature in Nuvi 660. 4&gt; No remote control with this unit. i found it extremely useful to zoom in and zoom out of the street level and the increase and decrease the volume. 5&gt; One desirable feature which is missing from all Garmin GPS models is the smart detour functionalilty available even in the cheapest Magellan models. You dont need to look around in the GPS maps to navigate around bumper 2 bumper traffic.. Pros:. 1&gt; Fodors North America preloaded on this makes it easier to see POI's. 2&gt; Bluetooth, MP3 and Picture viewing capabilities although i would rather listen to mp3 in my car audio system rather than on this tiny GPS speaker. i wouldnt encourage anyone buying the GPS because of these 3 features.. 

$$;
Pros:. compact size. 
Cons:. Traffic does not calculate anything but the faster route disregarding the traffic on the route. You could have a freeway closure and it would still pick that route.. 
Summary:. The traffic option need better programming. It doesn't factor traffic on the routes when it deciedes which freeways to take. I have three options that I can use. It only looks at the faster route if there were no traffic on it. The other freeways may get you there 30 minutes faster but it never checks. Don't buy this if you want to avoid traffic. I email garmin but never got a response.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen copes well with sunlight, the mount works well and is easy to use.. 
Cons:. Slow processor, disjointed spoken instructions, can't pre-plan routes, no 'qwerty' keyboard facility, maps out of date.. 
Summary:. I purchased the Garmin Nuvi 660 in May 2007 to use on a holiday in France during July. In the past I have used a TomTom GO 710 and was reasonably happy with it however the reviews I had read about the 660 influenced me to buy it. Thankfully I did not pay full price for it as I bought it duty free.. The problems I found were:. 1. Inability to preplan routes. If you are on a tight time frame as I often am, a few hours late one night inputting routes that you wish to use the next day can be a tremendous time saver - not so with the Nuvi 660.. 2. Poor voice instructions. The voice quality was so poor that the directional instructions were almost unintelligible. Unfortunately I discovered this trying to leave central Paris in peak hour.. 3. Incomplete instructions - "Turn ahead" No kidding - the world is full of roads and turns... I would like to know in advance which direction I will be turning in, especially when the traffic is heavy and fast.. 4. No 'qwerty' input. Given the amount of time people spend using keyboards, a selection of the most used keyboard layouts would be helpful.. 5. Out of date maps. I spent two weeks driving over roads which appear to have been in place for many years. A significant number of motorway slip roads and roundabouts did not appear in the database which caused some lost time. Given that I paid $700USD for the thing, I object to having to pay more money to update the maps so soon after purchase.. 6. Incredibly slow recalculation time. The shortest route recalculation time was 45 seconds, the longest was just over two minutes - completely unacceptable.. 7. No possibility of changing the map colours. For me, the map colours are pale and washed out and unfortunately they will stay that way without the means to change them.. 8. Lack of information on the main screen. Unfortunately the ancilliary information which I find important is not displayed on the main screen. Direction of the next turn, distance to destination, time to destination are either unavailable or on another screen. However I can go to the worlds most appalling mp3 player straight from the main screen though.... In the end, the older TomTom device that I have proved to be way better in almost every circumstance. If I can find someone willing to buy the Garmin, I might try the new TomTom GO 720.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice screen, Solid MP3 Player. 
Cons:. Slow screen refresh small 700 MB disk space. 
Summary:. I work as a Sales Engineer and having a fast reliable GPS is critical. I shelled out $900.00 at radio shack for my 660 and I am very dissapointed. So much so that I felt it neccessary to write this. I bought a TOM TOM 910 before this one and had problems with both(see that review).. The Garmine Nuvi 660 has a great screen, easy to set Favorites, great Point Of Interest database and good routing.. Everywhere else it fails to deliver. The useability compared to a TomTom is abyssmal. It's very difficut to control the volume, the FM radio transmitter is very weak and can't fully lock to the car stereo with majot static., in this case a 2007 Chevy Impala or a 2004 Landrover discovery.. When in route to a destination the screen is so slow and only refreshes every two seconds or so and when driving this is bad news. You can easily pass your turn without seeing your current position updated on the screen and the View of the route is much better on the Tom Tom.. 

$$;
Pros:. good entertainment system. 
Cons:. poor GPS system. 
Summary:. Not able to program or store routes! The unit will take only the current location as a starting point. You can enter only a single waypoint. Cannot store or even reverse current route. No bread crumbs or track back.. It does not always give the best route,although this is a problem common to all GPS units.. The unit zooms in and out at random and is beyond user control.. Cannot edit the data fields on the map screen--always your speed on the non-route function, and ETA when in the route mode.. It is OK as bluetooth and media device, but very limited in its GPS funtion. Other than the larger touch screen, it is not nearly the GPS unit of my 1st generation Quest!. When I made my feelings known to Garmin the reply was that they were giving the buying public all they wanted. If that is all you want then it is an OK unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. definately the best around. 
Cons:. not reliable and not worth the price. 
Summary:. i purchased my first nuvi 660 just about 6 months ago at a price of 630.00 euro`s.so far it has been replaced twice due to no sat signal,and after nearly 3 months hastle free use the speaker decided to pack in today,its absolutely great apart from its reliability. 

$$;
Pros:. crystal clear screen, POI features work well. 
Cons:. Way too many to list here. 
Summary:. This is a detailed review of the Garmin Nuvi 660, which I'm returning after 2 weeks of light use for the following reasons, in rank order, with most flaws exposing a shocking lack of thoughtfulness in Garmin hardware and process flow design. I hope it saves people time if they value their time and money.. 1) Inferior routing algorithm that makes the types of errors that none of my other 3 on-board car gps systems make. Silly things like getting off the highway 3 exits early to take local roads filled with stoplights. And yes, I'm sure the route preference setting is on "quick" not "short".. 2) On the map, it doesn't show the direction of the next turn. This omission is a deal-killer, too. I cannot believe Garmin does not have this because it's so basic a need. You HAVE to know which way to turn next, especially if the mapview is compressed along the vertical axis and you can't see which way the route meanders.. 3) The mp3 capability is a complete waste of hard disk space because the sound coming out of it totally, totally stinks. It's beyond bad. It's good enough for the nav voice guide, but horrible for music. Do NOT consider this a selling point at all because you will never use it, except for the expensive audiobook capability, perhaps.. 4) The system does not automatically shut off when you turn the ignition off. The Garmin stays on!!! Maybe this is to encourage you to remove the device and put it in the glove compartment for security reasons, but I park only in secured garages, so this is a pain.. 5) Even when you remove the unit and it turns off, if the power cord is still in the car's power outlet (unattached to the actual gps unit), the green light on the cord shows that power is still being fed through the cord -- EVEN WHEN THE CAR IS OFF!! This is a fatal error because if I park at the airport for a week, I'm going to be a bit annoyed when I find after a midnight arrival that the battery has been drained.. 6) When a user enters addresses, most good systems will show a first default screen listing the last cities entered so that you can select them. In this NUVI 660, you have to spell out the city name each time. Annoying and shows a lack of thoughtfulness in the workflow design.. 7) On mapview, it tells you the estimated arrival time, but I care more about distance to destination. Why not show both or if Garmin wants, it should let me choose which one I want. Or it should tell you BOTH. What makes this more maddening is that the mapview screen doesn't tell you what time it is, so then, you have to look at the estimated time of arrival and look at your watch or console clock and subtract the time to get estimated minutes to arrival. This is moronic.. In summary, for around $850 of hard-earned cash, this thing is barely acceptable in my opinion. People who rave about this system have obviously never used the Acura, Lexus, or BMW console navigation systems, which all have their own quirks, but are much better than this 3rd party outboard unit. I would have expected better, given that Garmin's sole focus is nav systems.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well when it works.. 
Cons:. Twice in less than a year and a half the unit has stopped working.. 
Summary:. I purchased this unit in late 2006. It worked very well for 9 months and then could only locate satellites on a very sporadic basis. I returned it to my local repair company who 3 weeks later sent me a new replacement unit. This worked for 5 months and then again the replacement unit was unable to locate satellites. 5 weeks ago I returned it to the same repair company (Raytech in Quebec) who have still not looked at it. They did inform me though that on replacement units the warranty is only 3 months and I will have to pay to have it repaired. The bottom line is based upon my experience I would strongly recommond potential buyers to not buy a Garmin GPS. In 1 and a half years the unit has failed twice, has been "in the shop" for 7 weeks and I will have to pay at least $250.00 to have it repaired. VERY disappointing!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Width of screen, windscreen mount &#38; protective case.. 
Cons:. When you search for POI they are not listed by distance, they are listed by distance to next turn. No Qwerty keyboard! When you enter new address you have to respell city everytime!. 
Summary:. I sold my TomTom One b/c I thought it had poor usability, now I wish I still have it and $400.00 I paid for this.. I just can't imagine this unit went through any usability testing before sent to market. The process involved to control the units volume is deep in the menu but the volume control for the MP3 player is a touch away. Why ALL volume controls are not in one location is beyond me.. The key board is alphabetical instead of Qwerty.... what a PAIN!. You can't enter an address using ZIP, you have to enter State &#38; city.. And you can't keep a compass indication on the primary map view.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice clear icons, widescreen was nice, screen was bright, bluetooth worked with my Blackberry. 
Cons:. Wrong or round about directions even with WAAS turned on, mapping issues, very limited Fodor travel info. 
Summary:. Kudos's to Garmin's marketing department but there are mapping issues. Had this unit for 3 weeks. I travel a lot as a pre sales tech engineer. I tested going to client sites that I knew how to get too. I know, "where's the trust". The unit's mapping was inaccurate. The had an easy way to update the code which I did. I updated to latest code from Oct 31, 2007. I turned on WAAS which was to be accurate to 3 meters or less and it still gave inaccurate directions or couldn't pick up where I was accurately for at times several miles. Called tech support, which was very nice, and they placed me in the engineering queue who admitted they had issues with mapping but being I downloaded the latest code it should work better - it didn't and I returned it. Partnership with Fodor didn't impress me as travel info was highly limited and the unit couldn't pick up restaurants or other places of interest in my town unless I typed them in myself. Not very helpful when on a trip and you don't know what is available. I returned the unit. The interface was very nice and people complain about no external audio controls but this wasn't a problem for me. There is a easy enough to use mute feature.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size. 
Cons:. Everything else. 
Summary:. I wish that I had read the reviews here first.... The mapping and routing software is first generation at best. Bells &#38; whistles abound, but basic function is not there.. No multi-hop routing - wow, didn't we figure that out back in the 90s?. No NMEA interface- forget hooking up your PC to this thing and feeding position data into a more sophisticated program like Streets &#38; trips. It's a big, dumb mass storage device. That's it. You can store your wedding pictures on there, MP3s, your favorite recipe for chicken tetrazzini... but forget doing anything useful with the USB link... like uploading a route plan or waypoints... or getting real time position information out of the unit. It's a glorified memory stick.. Sound quality is fine for voice directions, but horrible for anything else. So MP3 function is truly a waste.. I wish I could take this back, but Costco won't budge... at least it was on sale @ $500.. May be my first and last Garmin - I feel totally missled.. j.

Pros:. larger screen. 
Cons:. Navigation features very very weak when compared to other cheaper units. 
Summary:. For $850-900 Garmin has left too many navigation features out. For this price you can't even save a route on the unit, you can only enter a single destination, you can't plan routes, no ability to roadblock out roads or bad neighborhoods, etc. Garmin has dumbed the nuvi line too much. I agree with some of the other posts that only those that haven't used better units are impressed. Thats what Garmin is banking on.. 

$$;
Pros:. As at GPS I would rate it a 4. It does make occasional routing errors, particularly WRT shortest time routes.. 
Cons:. Internal non-replaceable battery fails at 2 years. Suction cups fail at 9 months.. 
Summary:. Garmin is a customer un-friendly company. At 9 mo. the first suction cup failed - they replaced it under warranty. Another 9 mo. later the second failed and they wanted $32.95 for a third one - which would have lasted 9 mo. Fortunately, eBay has great ones for $10 that last forever. Garmin could too if they wanted to. At two years the internal battery failed - this is a common occurrence. Garmin says the batteries will last 7 years which is the life of the product. This is simply a bald faced lie. Garmin also advertised the internal battery would run the GPS for 2 hours. They admitted over the phone this was false advertising and the real number is about 45 minutes. Garmin wants a $250 service fee to change out the battery! In other words: "go buy a new GPS after two years." Its a standard cell phone battery and could have easily had a door for user replacement. You can also buy a replacement battery and the tools you need to DIY - if you are handy - on eBay for $15 and hack it open yourself. My last Garmin product - they get you in the end and the products are not low cost at the time of purchase..

Pros:. Great when it can pick up satellites.....I guess ask too much for it to actually be able to get me somewhere. 
Cons:. My unit worked fine for several months and now is a piece of garbage....I rely on this for work and am disappointed it can not pick up satelites.....it was updated and this is my third Garmin (755, 660) and they all crapped out after several months.. 
Summary:. I will never spend another penny for any Garmin product and I strongly advise anyone that would listen to please spend your hard earned money with some other company.. 

$$;
Pros:. When working it is the best of gps. Great interface, great link to car and phone (blackberry bluetooth) Great screan and software. Would buy again but for antenna issue.. 
Cons:. Won't buy again. Web search shows that it is a common failure or design flaw. In contact with Garmin and will see how they respond.. 
Summary:. 800 dollars for a mp3 player, not happy! Rely on it for work and now without gps. Will amend if Customer Service is quick.. 

$$;
Pros:. holds sd card w/ photos &#38; mps. 
Cons:. illogical user interface. 
Summary:. poor. you're better getting the cheapo version gps vs. this expensive and semi useless device. after you input the information you constantly have to hit the "back" key to get back to the main menu. half of the features are not worth the bother and useless. sure it can hold mps but the speaker is not so great. photos are better if you want a slide show. blue tooth is okay. as for directions, it once told me to get off the high way just to get back on again in the same direction. true. after a while you get tired of it telling you to make a u-turn. the bigger screen is not worth the cost. you pay for the bells and whistles and will never use them. trust me. the raj.. 

$$;
Pros:. LOOKS NICE. 
Cons:. VERY POOR MAPPING (DIRECTIONS). 
Summary:. I bought this from Buydig as a recommended seller by CNET to replace an older Garmin GPS. I received it right before I was heading out on a trip and need the GPS. I thought great, perfect timiming. I set it up and input the address. I had to get to the highway which was straight and then left. It told me to turn right, drive out of the way then left and another left passing where I would been a couple of minutes earlier. On the way home, about half way, it was telling me to get off the highway and take local streets. When I ignored it and continued to the next highway that I had to take east, it was telling me to go west. I have been using GPS for about six years and have enough experience with them. This thing is a joke. My old Garmin works better. Garmin you suck. It seems like instead of improving your products, your making them worst. And I just found out Buydig charges a 10% return fee regardless of why you are returning something. I should have read their return policy before buying.. 

$$;
Pros:. None I can think of. 
Cons:. Almost everything. 
Summary:. For a hefty tab of 800 dollars, I expected something much better. I am very disappointed by the reviews from CNET and Consumer Reports - this product is rated #1 and I am yet to figure out why.. 1. Navigation is horrible - it picks the worst routes imaginable, both between cities/towns and within the city.. 2. I have tried this unit for 2 weeks now, and only a moron would take the routes it suggests. I have played around with all options, but the routes it suggests make no sense at all. Worse yet, it will suggest completely different routes if you program it 2 different times. And this has nothing to do with traffic data etc. or navigation options.. 3. The last straw was what it did in Philadephia. Between the same 2 points it gave me 3 different routes at 3 different times on a Saturday morning (read no traffic at all). It even sent me off on a bizarre route which essentially involved meaningless U-turns.. 4. Worse yet, it does not allow me to force a route because it allows only one intermediate point, and even for that point it does bizarre things when it comes to routing (including looping back).. 5. Yesterday, it completely lost orientation in Philadelphia. Realized what was happening when it was asking me to take the next turn on a street that I had just passed. Had to turn off the unit and restart it 2 times before it came back to its senses. Even then, the routes it was suggesting made absolutely no sense - no sane driver would choose them.. 6. Someone like me who drives a lot is likely to spot these gross errors. I bought it for my wife who does like to drive to unknown locations and would have really benefited from a GPS system. Clearly, this unit is not of much help to her.. Bottom line, the company and the reviewers need to do some real tests before they shoot their mouths off about how good this device is. It SUCKS!!!! I give it a rating of 0 (if that were possible).. I would love to hear a recommendation from someone who is satisfied with their unit (not Garmin Nuvi 660)..

Pros:. Small size, bluetooth, FM traffic alerts, FM transmitter, large screen size, battery powered. 
Cons:. No remote, FM transmitter is unusable for me with antennae in front on my 2006 Tacoma, limited Bluetooth, built in speaker strained at full volume. 
Summary:. I wanted to make this GPS work so bad. I have been using Garmin for a long time now and was between the 2820 and the Uvi 660. Due to the size and the built ins I went for the Nuvi 660. Sams Club was having a sale on them and I could not resist.. So I bring home my new 660 and charge it up. I then try to turn it on and it locks up. So I call Garmin, which has the best customer service, and they told me to take it back and get an exchange. This stuff happens so I went back and got a new one.. This one started up thank goodness but I was unable to find a FM channel to use so I can have handsfree over the radio. Even then I was OK, the 2820 can't go through the radio either so there is no reason to get that one instead. I use my cell phone a lot so I was looking forward to the handsfree feature. The problem is that the speaker is a little weak and I had complaints from people I was talking to about noise and them hearing themselves talk. Then I found out that you can't use a bluetooth earpiece with this system but you can on the 2820.. Since I drive a lot I use my GPS more than most people. When you frive that often you find that there are certain roads or areas that you NEVER want to drive on and avoid forever. The 2820 and the 2720 allow you to make cutom avoidances so the GPS always makes your route around that area. For example, I live in Houston, and if I wanted to go to North Houston the GPA will take me through the center of Downtown Houston to get there. If you do that you will wan to drive your vehicle off a bridge after sitting through that nightmare of a route. I would rather take one of the loops that goes around instead. With my 2720 it would avoid that area and just route me around it without me having to detour every time.. The other thing is the lack of remote. The remotes come in so handy when driving. If you haven't used a remote you don't know what you are missing. Volume control is easier and bluetooth functions are easier.. Another feature lacking is the categories under "favorites" This way you can have diferent categories for finding fanorites easier, like: restaurants, work, personal, vacation, etc. For this price of unit it should have better if not as good of options as the same priced 2820. I do like the battery powered function and how small the unit is but those pluses don't make up for all the minuses!!!!. I returned mine yesterday and now have a 2820 on order. The 660 is sexy but it is more of an entry level unit at a upper end price level..
