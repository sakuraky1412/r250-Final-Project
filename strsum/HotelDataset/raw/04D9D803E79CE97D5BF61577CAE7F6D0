stayed 3 nights from 23/10/10 .
small , no frills , motel with very pleasant , knowledgeable and chatty owners who very kindly picked us up from the station .
very good sleeping experience in clean , comfortable , relatively spacious room , good bed and extremely good bed linen , towels .
all in all it was a pleasant stay but let down by the bathroom shower , the water from which created a tent-like effect and tv reception which was terrible and the 4 channels unwatchable .
only cooking facility in the room is a microwave ( the owners kindly lent us a coffee plunger and a teapot ) and it is quite a stretch down into the town ( cold in october ) to find a reasonably priced meal , although there is an “up market” restaurant ( white morph ) not far down the road .
we had breakfast each day at cafe encounter which is almost next door , starts early around 7 a. m .
and can provide free wi-fi when you buy something .
there are no laundry facilities at sails which is a real nuisance for travellers and you have to walk 2+km to the town laundry .
kaikoura is not really a place for anyone without a car as the town stretches around the bay and is at least 3 km long .
deb & ted can advise on the town 's carhire company .
pretty much everything is a drive away and i would say that kaikoura only survives in these austere times because of the whale watching . . .

there is not much to do here otherwise.
