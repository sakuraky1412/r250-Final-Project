this hotel is in a great position , 5 mins walk from the guggenheim and 15 mins walk from the old town and lots of tapas bars .
it is on he river , and has a tram stop opposite across the foot bridge , and plenty of buses pass by too .
the hotel looks fantastic - it is fronted by an array of glass cubes coloured green , blue , purple , red .
orange and yellow - it really looks like a piece of architectural art , and tourists photograph it all the time .
it is a bit like a hotel made of glass lego .
make sure you pay the bite extra for a superior/deluxe room with a river view - these are the rooms in the boxes , and while there is no balcony , there are two doors with open up in each coloured cube which let you relax and take in the sun .
in summer you can not sea the guggenheim as the trees block the view , but i imagine in winter the view is great .
you can also sit at their tables on the street , and the food was good ( but over priced ) .
the cheaper rooms have no such view or `` box '' , and some of suites also have a horrible view on the back , but we saw that some suites on the top floor also have balconies - these would have a great view ( 7 stories high ) .
the hotel is a bit expensive , but the rooms were . . .

the hotel is a bit expensive , but the rooms were great , really good bath rooms , its is a stylish boutique-style hotel , and it is worth it just to see fellow tourists look up jealously while taking photos !
