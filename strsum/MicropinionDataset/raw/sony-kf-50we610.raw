Cons:. None to speak of..

Pros:. Many HDTVs I have seen have a great picture on HD channels and when playing DVDs, but have a terrible picture on regualar cable channels. This TV has a great picture on regular channels!!! In fact it has by far the best picture on regular cable channels. 
Cons:. a little pricey, but defineltely worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have had my 50" set now for 1 year and no problems to date. I do not get HDTV through my cable but picture still out does any projection TV and DVD's look absolutely astounding!. 
Cons:. Wished I had gotten the 60".

Pros:. Picture quality - and you can tell when the HiDef progamming kicks in...and DVD's look outstanding. Run, don't walk to get one of these - football, baseball...and the Travel channel all rock on this beauty. Although pricey, it's light, stylish and worth t.

Pros:. Easy to use. Picture quality is outstanding, so far. Stylish design, it looks good!! DVD movies are crystal clear. Makes you want to watch it over &#38; over &#38; over...again &#38; again. 
Cons:. No instant turnon, about a 15-20 second warmup (big deal!?) We'll be back with further updates..as time goes on...it's only 3 weeks old..

Pros:. The picture quality is incredible. I have a friend who bought a Samsung DLP at the same time I bought the Sony LCD. He has been complaining endlessly about pixelation on fast-moving scenes and the greenish hue on the Samsung. I, on the other hand, am t. 
Cons:. None..

Pros:. bought the 60" model locally in Madison, WI at a store called American TV. They operate in several midwestern Cities. About twice a year they have a sale on virtually all of there products.... it is a great time to buy the big ticket items as they are n. 
Cons:. none.

Pros:. I had been waiting to jump into the HDTV market, but was not impressed with the traditional big box projection sets. When the price dropped on this unit I could not resist. I was going to get the RCA DLP unit, or the Samsung DLP. But the store I went t. 
Cons:. none. 

$$;
Pros:. Initially I looked at Plasma and LCD direct view (DV) TVs, but Plasma has burn-in problems and LCD DV is still very expensive. Then I turned to LCD rear projection (RP), evaluated the Sony KF50WE610, the Hitachi HIT 50V500 and the Panasonic PAN PT50L. 
Cons:. First TV had two blue streaks down the left side. Returned it in Jan 2004. The stand is too expensive. Extended warranty also way out of line (that's how they make their money, I guess). Haven't had any problems with my second (Jan 2004 manufactured da. 

$$;
Pros:. What a great system -- I replaced my 28" tube with the 50" Sony. The Sony even weighs less. It is stylish and has a great picture. Definitely reccomend.. 

$$;
Pros:. everything about the tv is wonderful. check out some RPTV forums to learn tweaks to really getting this tv to shine.. 
Cons:. i wish it had Optical Sound out.. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding picture with lots of options. 7 inputs with 1 in front for video camera or digital camera or PS2 or whatever. Better than regular projection, just as good as dlp, lcd and plasma without having to spend the big$$$. Lightweight 82.2 lbs. Awesome. 
Cons:. NONE. 

$$;
Pros:. Its an LCD. Since the new thing is DLP, I guess that is the only drawback.. 
Cons:. I saw this side by side with the New Samsung DLP and the Panasonic LCD and the Sony Still sets the standard. The Samsung has a noticeable green tint to it while the Panasonic was too bright causing the details to be washed out. The Sony was as close to. 

$$;
Pros:. picture quality, field of view. 
Cons:. remote, menu. 
Summary:. I've had it a year and a half, and the picture is still excellent in HD, so-so in regular cable. I watch DVD movies, and sports a lot, and LOVE the HD broadcasts. Although the internal speakers are good, with decent seperation, they are no match for a great home theater surround sound system. The set is an perfect base for home theater, because no matter where you sit, you get an excellent picture, with striking clarity. At the time I bought it, the picture was the best, by far. I like that it is only about 17 inches deep. I shopped for 6 months before the purchase. Would buy again.. 

$$;
Pros:. I just watched the Super Bowl in HD and the picture was the absolute best. Beautiful bright picture in vivid mode. No malfunction yet. TV was manufactured August 2004.. 
Cons:. Non HD TV looks poor in full mode but acceptable in standard picture mode.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super TV. Already have a Sony 34" Grand Wega HDTV and this one does not disappoint especially at this price. We have a Sears surplus store here in Mpls. and I stopped in nearly every day and this one popped up one day. Some one returned it and it was in. 
Cons:. The remote is not as nice on my 34" Grand Wega but I just programmed the cable remote for tv, dvd and reciever.. 

$$;
Pros:. great value, can even watch your digital pictures from a chip on it.... 
Cons:. learning the split screen. 

$$;
Pros:. The integrated digital HD tuner allows you to get HD programming without an external box. I used the Comcast "cable card" which allows the tuner to decode the digital cable signal, which means all of the picture in a picture, favorites, and other built i. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb picture in High Def. DVD equally fine.. 
Cons:. A little slow at start up. Quality of set brings out the imperfections in cable. Can't wait for more HDTV channels. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright alive realism, with HD and progressive scan DVD. Even the DRC Multifunction makes STD 480i stuff look great. I have it hooked up to Cablevision iO digital cable using the SA4200HD STB. INCREDIBLE TV. 
Cons:. Weak options on the NON illuminated remote. Both things I can live with for the picture quality delivered by this baby.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and easy setup. Like the DVI input so I can connect my computer (using it now).. 
Cons:. Had lamp problem, but Tweeter was incredibly responsive. After initial visit, replaced TV and have not had a problem since. Wish set had two DVI inputs; One for the computer and one for the set top box.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unbelievable HD picture Good sound No risk of burn-in A lot of TV for a lot less money than plasma. 
Cons:. Remote only handles TV, VCR and cable. Wish it was more functional..

Pros:. Screen quality outstanding. Many inputs to conect various video equipment. Picture through DVD is awesome.. 
Cons:. Takes a few seconds to see picture. Worth the wait..

Pros:. Watching HD is amazing. If you can find a hockey game in HD, watch it, this TV will blow your mind. Its like your there.. 
Cons:. Not many, only thing is that regular television isnt as great as HD. Digital cable looks good though.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have had the 42" model since early March '04. Brightness, clarity, off-angle viewing are all excellent. I'm happy, my wife is thrilled, and our friends are amazed. HD broadcasts via Cox cable are outstanding, and even standard analog or digital braad. 
Cons:. Lack of deep black tone is noticeable on rare occasions.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good picture quality Value for the money No noise from the fan Very good sound. 
Cons:. Can not save picture adjustments Remote needs a one button closed caption on/off.

Pros:. For a 50 inch screen this set takes up no room at all, only 18 inches deep 80 lbs! Outstanding picture quality. REMEMBER big screen tvs only look as good as the signal you feed them i.e garbage in garbage out. Spend some money to get a decent quality s. 
Cons:. Where can you buy one? Sony cannot make enough sets. I work in the industry and we cannot keep them in stock. That goes for all sizes of the LCD. Wish it had another component input.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have had this set for almost a month now, and I couldn't be more pleased with the buy. I must admit that I was really hesitant to buy it, as the feedback and comments form earlier buyers alarmed me. My set was manufactured in March, so the problems expe.

Pros:. I've had this TV for almost a month. It is a great TV. I received a March 04 build. This TV really excels with DVDs and of course a HD signal looks great. I've had the opportunity to see a couple of NBA, MLB, NCAA Tournament games, and the Masters and my.

Pros:. Awesome picture, especially on HD (really unbelievable). Picture by picture an awesome feature - you can adjust the sizes of the screens. Regular digital signal is not such a great picture - you get spoiled on the HD..

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is fantastic, particularly with HD stations.. 
Cons:. To take full advantage of this set, I need Time Warner to add more HD stations (e.g. ESPN, MSG) in NYC.

Pros:. This set offers a very high quality picture. In my opinion the best I have seen including high end plasmas. It is also the best priced HDTV for it's size. Has a good remote with a good set of inputs (3 separate HDTV capable inputs and 4 others). There are. 
Cons:. The blacks are not as deep as the DLP but they are still very good. On regular TV it does tend to look worse than your old CRT TV but it really depends on the quality of signal. If you get a good clean cable signal the picture looks good. As I mentioned a. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality (sharp and bright), lots of features and settings to alter.. 
Cons:. No PIP. Had a problem with the buzzing sound as with all Sony Grand Wegas but issues has been fixed now. Those who have it and still have a problem, Sony has released a new fix that remedies the problem completely.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent image quality when you get Digital Cable. It looks even more beautiful in design when display with the stand that was design for the TV. I love the fact that it is very thin, and the double channel play. Sound also is excellent with good strong. 
Cons:. The TV stand that came witht the TV is a little pricy and could be a little wider to match with the TV exactly demension size. However, if you own this TV you must buy the stand also, it looks beautiful together.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome picture, great size, easy to use.. 
Cons:. Sets made in late 2003 have circuitry problem, so MAKE SURE you buy a set made in 2004. 

$$;
Pros:. They ALL look good on HD or DVD but what seperates this TV from all the rest is the basic cable picture. You can watch 4:3 or 16:9 without the worry of burn-in. Sowhat if the bulb goes out in a year. I found it on e-bay for 105.00. It is worth 105. per ye. 
Cons:. Finest picture I have ever seen! No burn-in. Good looks My only complaint: WEAK remote. 

$$;
Pros:. you'll think your at the movie theater, except you can get beer! DVD;s and HDTV will spoil you for anything else ever. Wide zoom mode takes out any distortion when viewing 4:3 aspect television with very little lose of viewing area. AWESOME!.

Cons:. The Sony stand is pretty but not useful. If you have a surround speaker system and a decent sized centre channel speaker - there is no space to put the speaker below the TV. I ended up getting an alternative stand for the Sony TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is good out of the box and improves considerably after tuning (I used Avia suggested in CNET). Good price - I paid 2700 (after rebate and discounts) at local Circuit City. Picture quality is superb, specially when watching DVDs. I still ha. 
Cons:. The 4:3 transmission in wide-zoom is still a bit streached out (as expected). I like to turn close captions on when my kids are making tons of noise in the living room. However, to turn it on, I have to go to menu, move to the right-most menu box, scroll. 

$$;
Pros:. Quality, picture, ease of use.. 
Cons:. Last year's models had manufacturing defect, so be sure to purchase from a reputable retailer and make sure your set was manufactured in 2004. 

$$;
Pros:. Ok, I've only got the 42" version so I'm commenting on it. I think CNet's review is incorrect. I'm able to save picture settings for each individual input. I can't believe that you can't do it on the 50" model. The picture quality is excellent. During. 
Cons:. Actually nothing related to the TV. Can't get HD hooked up because Cox (Orange County) only lets you rent one HD cable box per household and this is my bedroom TV. Didn't find that out until after I bought the TV to be able to have HD in my bedroom too.. 

$$;
Pros:. got it from best buy for $2820 and 4 year warranty for $249 fit pretty well on a $149 BUSH stand(for 36 inch,also from best buy) every body likes it. best picture quality on DVD havn't tryed HD program but still looks good in analog signal this TV set wit. 
Cons:. can't be turned on couple of times but recovered soon.and I know many people have this problem too.so buy a longer term warranty if you decide to buy this one. 

$$;
Pros:. I've had this set for three weeks now and the picture is simply outstanding. Cable HD broadcasts are stunning on this set. DVD's are awesome. After w week of having this TV I had to go out and buy a home theater system to go along with the great picture. 
Cons:. None to date.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just got hooked up to HDTV and it is awesome! Football is sooo much better on HD!I was able to buy this TV for 2700. Plus another $150 rebate from Circut City. It can't compare to a 42" Plasma that's only EDTV. 
Cons:. It's such a hot selling TV that many stores are having a hard time keeping them in stock. Sony had no idea they'd be selling this great and will take a while for production to meet the demand.. 

$$;
Pros:. Like may others, I'ved been researching for the perfect HDTV monitor. When I saw this beauty I know I got to have it. But I have to wait for 3 weeks to get it on our local CC store its out of stock everywhere. So I pre-ordered it and got a good deal the T. 
Cons:. Waiting for it to arrive =(. 

$$;
Pros:. I am confused as at my locat Best Buy, 50" DLP (Samsung) looked clearly superior to 50" LCD (Sony). Then I went to Circuit City and I would give slight edge to the Sony LCD... I played with the settings at Circuit City and got the DLP to look nearly id. 
Cons:. Finally, I went to my local 'Good Guys' (a CompUSA subsidiary in California) and they only sell SONY. The Sony set looked stunning. I finally decided to buy the SONY but of course, it is sold out. It is sold out at Best Buy, Circuit City and Good Guys.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Picture quality is outstanding when playing DVDs or Video Games. I have it hooked up to my Directv. The picture quality is not as great from the Directv system from some channels.. 
Cons:. I need HDTV to take full advantage of the picture quality!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Memory card features, 1080i resolution, smaller in size compared to other rear projectors. 
Cons:. Takes a little time to warm up, speakers aren't that great, and using home theater system with the audio out signal distorts badly. 
Summary:. I have always been a fan of Sony TV's so my opinion is not very objective because I believe Sony is the best brand. The only problem I have in general is the advancement of technology with the TV's. I am use to it with computers but I just bought this model a year ago and the best resolution it can get is 1080i with component cables. Now with the HDMI cable with 1080p resolution on the newer TV's makes me mad since I should of waited.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture is great, once our cable company upgraded our wiring.. 
Cons:. The lamp burned out after only 18 months. We have the TV on only in the evenings for a couple of hours and a maybe 8 hours on the weekend, TOPS.. 
Summary:. Our viewing time is not excessive, as we have a plasma that shares our viewing time. We may not have bought this TV had we known that the life of the lamp was so short.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic picture quality. 
Cons:. Bad PC display. 
Summary:. I love this TV. The picture quality is incomparable, IMO. The only problem I have is that I bought this along with a SONY Media Center Edition PC at COMPUSA and now Sony tell sme that the two aren't compatible. What the?!!? How can they sell this TV RIGHT NEXT to their Media Center PCs and tell me that they don't work together? I feel ripped off.. Well, the good news is that it does work halfway decent, although you really have to fiddle with the display controls in MCE to make it work. I get overscanning with my PC (a small border is cut around the edges), but otherwise it's a great way to sit on your couch and do some internet surfing, get some work done, and do all the Media Center things, like listen to music, look at photos, play DVDs, etc.. But all that's in relation to one feature. As far as its HD display, this TV is better than any TV I've ever seen. And it's a relative bargain, too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture!. 
Cons:. Had to replace bulb after 14 months (two days before superbowl party!) Each bulb costs $200 and sony csr said average life is 12months (seller told me 3 years).. 

$$;
Pros:. great size,screen setting that allows you to avoid stretch the screen but keep a good pictureby cutting off top and bottom (a good trade off that was easy to get used to). 
Cons:. Had one of the two we bought crash within a week but store (Cambridge Soundworks) immediately replaced it.

Pros:. Great Hi-Def Picture and decent non Hi-Def picture. Great sound and vibrant color.. 
Cons:. The non Hi-Def picture is OK, but a little distorted in full wide view..

Pros:. Plenty of Input options including DVI. Great Picture. Very good sound.. 
Cons:. No built-in HD Tuner or Cable Card. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim cabinet, ultra crisp picture w/dvds and cable comes in pretty clear if you've got digital cable.. 
Cons:. I have a 27 in wega that kicks better bass out the speakers but it's not bad at all. You prob have a good surround system if you're buying this anyway..

Pros:. Great picture out of the box. Hard to imagine it getting much better when I get my HDTV tuner this weekend. Outstanding, easy to use features (picture-and-picture, favorite channel preview, etc.). This TV is all its cracked up to be and more. Happy to. 
Cons:. The picture gets stretched a bit on some cable channels. Primarily noticeable when trying to read sports tickers. Black-level performance is a little suspect..

Pros:. Great picture with a DVD progressive scan. Gamers will love the view, especially if you have a surround sound system.. 
Cons:. Regular cable tv doesn't look that great, a bit grainy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very clear picture and vivid colors for a non-plasma TV. Very stylish TV compared to other LCD RPTVs.. 
Cons:. Lamps may be an issue, but as long as it was manufactured after Jan. 2004, the TV should work fine!. 

$$;
Pros:. Only picture adjustment that I needed to perform out of the box was a color adjustment. Took all of 20 seconds. Had none of the big screen setup ritual many have to go through, no need whatever for a pro to come and calibrate. Wonderful picture, not too h. 
Cons:. Large screen HDTV's really brings the flaws in cable broadcasts to the fore. I have HDTV Digital Cable but I also have it connected to a Tivo unit. Tivo doesnt yet do HDTV so I havent seen what the TV can really display via the HDTV cable channels. Obviou. 

$$;
Pros:. Best value for the pic. Lets face it, HD programming all looks GREAT, either LCD or DLP. And all SD programming on these sets, DLP and LCD REAR, will not look that great..Nature of the beast. My opinion is that for the savings of $1,000, LCD is the way. 
Cons:. SD programming not sharp, but then agian, it never really is with DLP or LCD rears either.. 

$$;
Pros:. awesome picture, image and audio features, lightweight.. 
Cons:. cost. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Colors and Clarity. Worth the money and the wait....... 
Cons:. No HD programming, as with any HDTV, looks poor due to flaws in the broadcast not the TV. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture quality for high definition and DVD's. User friendly, and luckily, no bulb problems like many sets from my model month. Considering the cost difference to buy an equivelant plasma, this is a very good deal.. 
Cons:. Some non-HD stations are pretty bad, with most others good to average. Some minor "clicks" in the speakers once in awhile.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim RPTV More than 720p pixels Gorgeous picture and case. 
Cons:. Some typical RPTV compaints (black levels, viewing angles, etc).

Pros:. Amazing screen with HD input. Colors, picture, etc. look better than anything else out there. Sound is incredible for a TV of a this size. Ours was manufactured on March 2004 so we're assuming that the light problems have been resolved. Lightweight, unobt. 
Cons:. If you have anything less than 720p, you might as well forget it. DVD's look pretty good but they only come in at 480p which is not bad. When we had analog input in, we had to sit farther back as the screen became very rough at edges. This will make you w.

Pros:. Thanks everyone for your Pros and cons posted here. After reading, researchign and looking at various sets in stores i decided that for the price this was the set to get, and I don't regret it one second. And there are no bulb problems with 42" set.. 
Cons:. Lack of independent inputs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light weight and a great picture. Fantastic DVD picture. Mine has been performing beautifully.. 
Cons:. Needs more ajustable picture sizes. Some dark scenes (like the alley way fight scene in SPIDER-MAN) are too muddy. Black for the most part is ok..

Cons:. Black level not as true as CRT displays. Took over 5 weeks to get the TV because of back order.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great HD picture with my Comcast HD box. I use this TV in my family room which get a lot of light, no problems with glare or screen reflection watching during the day with the shades open. This one benefit makes it worth it. The light weight is a big help. 
Cons:. Problem with the lamp, good response time from Sony, purchased in NOV 03. Can only use it as a computer monitor using a mini jack which gives a poor picture. Other wise money well spent.. 

$$;
Pros:. fantastic picture, beats out DLP TV's in my book. 
Cons:. history of lamp failures unnerving, but purchased with a sticker date of manufacture after jan 2004 have the bugs worked out.

Pros:. This is a hot TV. Picure looks great and blacks look darher than other LCDs. I am recommending to all my friends.. 
Cons:. A bit pricey, but hey it is a Sony.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim, light, will have better picture than some less expensive plasma's. Lots of connections. Very good sounding speakers. HDTV lives up to its expectations.. 
Cons:. While watching hockey on HD, the white ice shows imperfections in the screen. The anti-glare make-up takes some of the picture away. A 46" would have been perfect. 42" is too small, the 50" too large. Should drop the 42, make a 45-46" then raise the 50 to. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good picture with DVDs (even with 480i signal): great color saturation and crisp detail. Wider viewing angle and brighter picture than traditional RPTVs. Slim design. Wow factor.. 
Cons:. Black levels (I'm nitpicking here: they are very good, just not excellent). Standard TV picture looks blocky (then again, what would you expect from watching 300 lines of resolution on a 50-inch screen?).

Pros:. I have the 60 inch version and have been amazed by the picture on HD and DVD signals. So far no problems! I highly recommend this for the price compared to other plasma's and lcd's. PS2 looks nice too!. 
Cons:. Picture is a little blocky when watching non DVD or HDTV sources..

Pros:. great color and contrast for price. easily beats out any edtv plasma products, and almost on par with Sony's own top of the line hdtv plasma. sound quality is good.. 
Cons:. case around product is too large. the depth is extremely attractive, but the width and height are much larger then a plasma set. i'm wondering what was sony's aim to slimline one dimension, and increase the other two? the lcd lamp has a live of about 2.

Cons:. Like buying a new computer, who sleeps at night or works during the day. HA HA. Cable box which is not in HD widesreen do fatten the subjects a bit. Wide/zoom mode fixes problem but cable will not let it work as you can only get the full screen mode... 

$$;
Pros:. After nearly a year of research, this is the TV I went with. DLP does in fact have noticable problems, whether it's small green pixels (watch a very dark movie on DLP, you'll see them here and there), or a rainbow effect after watching for a half-hour.. 
Cons:. Some models made in 2003 were made with a flaw in the lamp that causes them to burn out. Mine was one of those models. The item would have been repaired faster, but Circuit City kind of dropped the ball - it's a pretty easy upgrade, and Sony offers "kit. 

$$;
Pros:. Great HDTV and Other features. We just love viewing HDTV this set is very thin considering it is an LCD rear projector. We love Sony products. 
Cons:. Our first set (42") was purchased from Circuit City. We took the extended warranty and after two weeks it would not turn on as documented many times on this site. We called Circuit City and they brought out a new one an it works perfectly (3 months now). 

$$;
Pros:. Features, pic quality, design, etc...It's the best TV I've ever owned.

Pros:. Fantastic picture with HDTV and DVDs. It is fine for Cable TV even if it is a bit streched in FULL MODE. HDTV spoils you for all other TV watching. Love the Twin View. Plenty of inputs for all your audio video equipment. I bought it to watch sports in. 
Cons:. I am not getting enough sleep as I can't take my eyes off this beauty!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good picture for a projection, but thats because its LCD projection. No image burning, unlike plasma. User replaceable bulb. Great expected life-span. HDTV will look marvelous on this TV. Twin Veiw is the best feature ever. You can watch the equival. 
Cons:. Without HDTV picture gets streched pretty wide, so picture quality decreases a bit. Especially with live broadcasts, but cable looks good.. 

$$;
Pros:. very good deal if you can still find a june+ 2005 model.. 
Cons:. do not buy without a warenty, buy a HDTV dvd player.. 
Summary:. great TV, really good picture quallity on HDTV Cable, had the cable company put a dirrect line to the TV, full 100% signal,. bought the tv refurbed 2000$ canadian plus tax, when i got home, there was a lighter spot on the bottom right hand coner, an then next, all these blue lines, went all over the screen, i found out though, if i hit the tv, they go away, anyone have these issue's? good thing i got the 5 year warenty from FutureShop..

Pros:. Was originally looking at the RCA Scenium line DLPs. Went into hhgregg (similar to BestBuy) to buy the RCA and noticed something I hadn't previously - GLARE! The RCA and the 610 were both moved to a new area on the showroom floor and exposed them to more. 
Cons:. Can't preset color and such for each of the video inputs independently. Uses same settings across the board for each input. But more importantly, NO built-in HDTV tuner! That sux. Luckily my cable company just recently started providing local HD content v. 

$$;
Pros:. I read a lot of negative reviews about bulb and bad pixels !!!!Ignore them!!!! I spent 2 months playing detective and made my purchase I am as happy as a pig in you know what. The picture (with Voom Sat service) is very very good in fact better then some. 
Cons:. The stand was way too expensive and to small to put all my stuff in. Reicevers, DVD,xbox, PS2 and ETC. Go a different path for a stand. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up, very light and shallow. Picture is amazingly sharp and clear and beautiful when viewing an HD source, like the Olympics.. 
Cons:. Front AV/Input cover was broken on arrival. You'd think a TV at this price would be made from better materials. Picture looks fantastic with an HD source--okay with analog. If you aren't buying this while planning to invest in an HD antenna or a satellite. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful sharp image from DVD and HD channels.. 
Cons:. Speakers on side lead to increase dimensions.

$$;
Pros:. I tried to do a lot research prior to purchase. An excellent web site for product reviews is ecoustics.com. I was looking for a 42" tv that could be placed in an entertainment center, this narrowed my search down to the Sony LCD projection and the Samsung. 
Cons:. My main concern at the time of purchase was regarding the lamp problems that were being reported. I don't normally buy an extended warranty, but because of my concerns I did in this case. I bought my TV at the first of Feb. and by the last of April I did. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture adjustment, nice PIP, numerous input choices, awsome picture.. 
Cons:. Some pixelation noticeable, could be a little clearer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous picture. Good color. Bright even in a sunny room.. 
Cons:. First one had a bad power supply and several stuck pixels, but second is perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Vivid colrs and clarity. HD channels look amazing. Wide variety of configuration options and inputs. Setting the new standard for affordable HD sets. Plasmas are not going to last I bet.. 
Cons:. Beware, all 3 models in this series are known to have lamp (bulb) issues. Sony may have resolved this by now for new ones. My lamp blew after only 3 months. Luckily, its covered under warranty and has worked fine since. Speakers not so great. Big screen c. 

$$;
Pros:. Small width Good Picture Great Price Memory Stick Feature. 
Cons:. Picture Detail; Black Levels; No built in HDTV Tuner If you can Afford it, Go with the 60 or 70 inch Sony XBR LCD. Fantastic Black Levels; Great Picture; Very good built in speakers; Protective Screen Cover; better build quality. Looks Awesome. The XBR's. 

$$;
Pros:. Great price per performance. Wonderful picture. Slim and lightweight.. 
Cons:. Initial batches of sets suffered from bulb failures. Buyer beware - ask questions!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture. In a side by side comparison, i felt it was much more vivid than the Samsung DLP (at roughly $600 less).. 
Cons:. I too have experienced the VERY FRUSTRATING problem of the TV not turning on intermitantly. Talked to Sony today as well as had a technician out today. Sony has finally acknowledged there is a design problem and has identified the root cause. There is a. 

$$;
Pros:. Great HD Pic, love the size!. 
Cons:. won't turn on! It will just not turn on sometimes. 
Summary:. If I could find the answer to the powering on problem, this would be a superb buy. I bought it online for about $2100 and it was a steal!! I just cannot get this to turn on sometimes. The green light comes on and then nothing...... 

$$;
Pros:. Otherwise good product. 
Cons:. Had exactly the same problems as Noel L did, problem never appeared reliably enough to get a serviceman in. Intermittently made what sounded like an arcing noise but the lamp showed no signs of damage to the pins or connectors. Finally the lamp died, ab. 

$$;
Pros:. After using the unit for some time I have to repost my experiences, this is my replacement unit (manufactured in 2004) and the Lamp problem is gone (at least for now, fingers crossed). Picture quality is stunning, specially when the format is progressive. 
Cons:. I have a cable box, a home theater system and my Xbox (HD pack) and the 3 of them use component outputs, the TV only have 2 component inputs and 1 dvi, this is a major drawback now I have to buy a DVI cable to use with my cable box; bottom line is that th.

Pros:. Great while it lasted. Refurbished price.. 
Cons:. Lamp and Lamp power source blew out after 3 weeks. Took them a week to come check it out, and it's been in the shop for two weeks now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stunning picture. 
Cons:. Starting second day, wouldn't turn on half the time... only a buzzing sound and flashing light. Returned to Good Guys and was told that other models on the showroom floor were having the same problem. BestBuy sales person reported the same thing. I ret. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture - great price. We have satellite HDTV and everyone who sees it can't get over how great the picture is. I like having 7 video inputs too. 
Cons:. We have trouble with the set not turning on and off and we're waiting for a replacement set. Best Buy told us that they won't sell this set anymore because it is being recalled by Sony because of that problem. Sony has not answered by inquiry about that. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the picture - we have satellite HDTV and the picture is really beautiful. Everyone who's seen it is amazed at the clarity and color. 
Cons:. We're still waiting for a replacement TV because the one that was delivered doesn't shut off. The screen glows and we have to pull the plug to turn it off completely. Then if you try to turn it on again, it won't work. I know it's a defect so we're wai. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks great. Price is right. When it works its got an excellent DVD / HDTV picture. SD leaves something to be desired.. 
Cons:. Be sure you get the OSRAM bulb. The reason the TV's are not in stock is beacuse Sony is replacing all of the Phillips bulbs. The new batch that should be here by April will have the OSRAM bulb and will last more than 40 hours! Check some of the AV foru. 

$$;
Pros:. Sweet T.V. for the price, great display. Matches DLP perfomance for less money, No burn-in.. 
Cons:. I bought the Sony wega LCD projection TV model # F-42WE610 and only after 4 days it had problems turning on because the lamp light was flashing indicating that the bulb was bad. I had Best Buy swap it out for another one and worked great for a couple of m. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture. 
Cons:. If the set would turn on then it might be worth the $3000 I paid for it. I had it for 2 days and it will not turn on. All I get is blinking lights.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent set unfortunately denigrated by absolutely awful Sony service. 
Cons:. For some reason Sony does not take customer service seriously for any of its products, whethe TV's, digital cameras or cell phones. The wait is in the weeks, call backs often don't occur, and warranty service essentially doesn't occur. It is a shame sin. 

$$;
Pros:. Great TV when it works. 
Cons:. THis model has a major problem: sometimes it will come on sometimes it want! The service person from Best Buy said they are no longer selling them because of the problem. Most are being returned.. 

$$;
Pros:. DLP: stronger blacks, more depth LCD: Cheaper by $700, close picture quality. 
Cons:. LCD: PIXELS DIE AND GET STUCK ON GREEN AND BLUE&lt; LOOK CLOSE YOUR SET HAS THEM AND THEY WILL GET WORSE DLP: Mirrors go out but do not show in form of neon blue dots.

Pros:. Great picture and features.. 
Cons:. Problems as noted: 50" Wega Sony LCD Projection TV Model KF-60WE610 Bought first unit on Oct. 3, 2003. We were gone from Oct. 7 through Oct. 24. On Oct. 31 the unit did not turn on (the replace lamp light started flashing). It had operated earlier in t.

Pros:. Great picture; good viewing angle; very lite package.. 
Cons:. Also having problems getting the set to come on. Need to turn on and off several times - then will come on. Our area is also sold out of the units.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture. 
Cons:. Broke after 2.5 years. 
Summary:. Fortunately I had a 4 year warranty. After 2.5 years, I had blue lines and a large blue tint permanently appear on the screen. Repair says it's a problem with the light motor which they are shipping to me and they will ultimately replace. Says it does happen to LCD TV's from time to time. It's about a $1200 repair. The blue tint can be orange or other colors. I discovered other Sony KF-50WE610 owners have complained about this same problem as well.. If you do buy this tv, max out the warranty.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice Picture. 
Cons:. Bulb, Ballast, Lamp-Driver problems. 
Summary:. Owners who've had trouble with Sony GWIII's bulbs, lamp drivers, ballasts, circuit boards, buzz/no starts, optical blocks, etc., can review information regarding a potential class action lawsuit at http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/sony_rear_projection_lcd_tv. 

$$;
Pros:. Bought this TV for my husband for his birthday. He loved it until.....(now read the con part). 
Cons:. After just a couple months of use, the lamp blew, and I mean shattered. I read on this site about this problem before purchasing it but understood it had been fixed in the later manufactured units. Not so. after much effort, i finally was able to talk. 

$$;
Pros:. HD and DVD's look very good. 
Cons:. Just make sure that before you buy any HD TV, you see the regular channels in it, because they look bad, (the salesman will not show them to you) and that's what you'll be watching most of the time. In the regular channels, everything is pixelated.. speci. 

$$;
Pros:. HD output excellent, on par with some of the plasma and DLP's I've seen.. 
Cons:. Two months old (June 2004 mfg date) now its powering itself down, and all I have is a blinking (4x) power led. Anyone contemplating purchasing one of these sets, reconsider. What I'm experiencing is not a lamp problem, but a circuitry problem of some sort. 

$$;
Pros:. If you must own an LCD at this price, then get this set. If you are open to more possibilities then read on. This LCD RPTY places a distant 3rd when compared to the Samsung DLP (2nd) and any other CRT RPTV (1st place) If space is a limiting factor, then. 
Cons:. 3 pixels dead in 3 weeks. GHOSTING! This is my single biggest issue with any LCD TV, it makes it absolutely horrible to watch sports! Pushes reds by about 25%. Poor black levels (when compared to other technologies). Green Hues in blacks. Blue Hues in wh. 

$$;
Pros:. O.K. black level and looks better on cable than the samsung DLP. user changable bulb isnt bad.. 
Cons:. unlike DLP there is no detail in your darker images. yes, looks like a nice dark black on the proper picture setting but still no detail. tv is great if your not a videophile.

Pros:. Picture quality is a lot better than those CRT projection TV.. 
Cons:. Over-Priced. Picture quality is a lot lower than DLP &#38; LCoS projection TV. Very expensive projection bulb...need to replace the short life projection bulb regularly. Prices will drop like a rock when the new generation LCoS projection TV flood the mar. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice picture for the cost.. 
Cons:. Widely experienced failures of the bulb/light engine assembly..

Cons:. If I cannot turn it on after only 2 weeks of using - this TV is no good. Looks like a common problem with this model.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good size, not too heavy, looks great in a condo..

Pros:. Great picture quality, above average sound. 
Cons:. Will not turn on, only gives buzzing sound after 5 days and less than 5 hours of use. 

$$;
Pros:. the picture is great once the set turns on.... 
Cons:. we have had the TV for about 1 month and in that time we have had nothing but problems. The TV turns on about half the time, the other half of the time it makes a buzzing noise and then the lamp light starts blinking and no picture. We have had the techni. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice coloring especially on HD. 
Cons:. Components don't seem to last.. 
Summary:. I had this set and within 7 months the lamp had to be replaced and now the light engine has gone out and the repair charges are over $1200......Sony could have offered the engine and I would have paid for the repair.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture! Like Twin View and Other Features!. 
Cons:. Two (2) Lamps replaced in less than one (1) year from date of purchase. (Replacement required because the TV would not turn on.) Light motor needs replacement as of 8/05.. 
Summary:. We purchased the LCD TV 11/03, manufactured on 10/03. We are very disappointed in the operation of this very expensive product. As of 8/05, service repair men have replaced the lamps twice (01/04 &#38; 09/04) because the TV would not turn on which was apparently due to defective lamps. As of 8/05 we are waiting for Sony to send a replacement light/motor part to local service repair company for the "New" problem. Information gathered from various repair service personnel and on-line sources seem to insinuate that this type of lamp is damaged more quickly if the TV is turned "off" and "on" in rapid succession. Interesting that this point is not mentioned in the Operating Instructions manual. Best of luck to all current and future owners.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice picture, I got this one over the Samsung DLP because mainly 3 reasons: 1- It looked better in definition(pixels separation) and had no-noise (Samsung DLPs have noise, it can be noted on a still or nearly-still picture), 2- It was a Sony, Sony at my. 
Cons:. Had to replace it once, after 5 days of use, lamp went off (i had no blinking Lamp light) and never againg turned on. Sony customer service was responsive and fine, but the schedule in-home service was for forteen days wait, I decided to return it, no pro. 

$$;
Pros:. Look, from what I remember the picture is great.. 
Cons:. Same song, different singer. We also have the lamp problem. Best Buy service jacked me around. Sony told me to return it to Best Buy. I talked to BB manager and they are picking up this one and bringing another one in the morning. Word of advice here... 

$$;
Pros:. design,looks ease of moving as location etc. picture quality ok easy on the eyes. 
Cons:. failed to turn on at the second week of use. the circuit city 2nd. string.mgr. a real 'ape' could not help. after a week of calls to circuit city repair dept. was able to get help from sony also sony should provide a better remote control unit for $3000. 

$$;
Pros:. Bought this TV in February 2004, mnaufactured date of February 2004. Beautiful picture for the first 11 days, thn it died -- same bulb problem.. 
Cons:. Clearly Sony would prefer to make money selling TVs above all esle. Do not be swayed by people saying "TVs manufactured in 2004 are OK" -- it's not true. Now we're stuck -- we really like the design, but I'm sure if we get a replacement TV it will have. 

$$;
Pros:. This is a great set. Not perfect but none of the major types of sets are perfect. They all have certain limitations and you simply have to weigh which set of limitations you are willing to live with. Direct View sets are great but don't go above 40 inc. 
Cons:. Now, a prior poster - DjBret - stated that this set looks bad on nearly all current non-high definition tv stations. He goes on to say that you shouldn't worry because by May of 2006 (a full two years from now by the way) all stations will be "required t. 

$$;
Pros:. Great looking picture when it's on.. 
Cons:. Set won't turn on; red indicator signals burnt out bulb. After 3 levels of management, Sony finally agreed to pay for in-home visit. Very poor customer service for a $3000+ TV. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen.. 
Cons:. Very short life of unit. Picture quality poor.. 
Summary:. You will be lucky if the unit last within its 90 day warrantee. Product is very inferior and subject to several lawsuits. Poor customer support.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture looked good for almost 2 weeks!. 
Cons:. Bought TV in February (built in Feb. 2004) and had it die shortly thereafter. Tried repair first -- Best Buy repairman said he's working on 2 of these *per day* including some repeat customers. I asked him about the Panasonic, Hitachi and Samsung LCD p. 

$$;
Pros:. At first I thought it looked great and it had a great reputation because it was made by Sony but I was WRONG!. 
Cons:. Optical block defect (yellow stains on the screen) and Sony's unwillingness to correct a known defect unless required by law.. 
Summary:. After about 1 and a half years and hardly using the TV, a big yellow pixilated stain measuring about 4 or 5 inches wide ran down the right side of the screen along with 2 crisscrossing lines in the middle near the bottom of the screen. Over time the crisscrossing lines disappeared but the big fat yellow patch remains. Sony customer service is absolutely useless and has absolutely no concept on how to treat their once loyal customers that put their faith in the Sony name. $3 k is way too much money to drop onto a piece of crap. Don't buy Sony otherwise you will be utterly disappointed if you end up with a lemon that shows its true colors right after the warranty expires. They have become extremely lame. There already exists some class action lawsuits on some of their other models. They need to include this one in on it too because there are a lot of buyer reviews on Amazon regarding blue hazes, blue spots and yellow stains. So disappointing :(. 

$$;
Pros:. Very attractive set.. 
Cons:. Expensive and poor customer service.. 
Summary:. Do a simple internet search on all of the known issues with this model and there will be no question why this tv should not be purchased. We paid $3k for ours and they now want us to spend another $1200 to replace the optimal block. There was an extended warranty due to a class action lawsuit but our problem didn't begin until two months after the expiration. So basically, too bad even though it is a known default in the product.. I called customer service and Sony's customer service reps told me I have no options but to pay to have it repaired. I expressed my dissatifaction with the situation as this is a known issue of Sony's and they now expect me to pay $1200 to fix a tv when I can spend $900 and get a new one..... I then asked the Customer Service rep whether it was Sony's wish to lose customers over something they knew was wrong and she said I can continue to ask for help but I will never receive it. So, in essence, buy another brand.. :( I am so disappointed!!!.
