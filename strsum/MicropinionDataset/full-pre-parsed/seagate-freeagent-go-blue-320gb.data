so much better than the wd my passport  .

it has no virtual cd so you can use it any way you like .

i bought this product a year ago  .

i am thrilled to have it for back ups and to put all my large projects , movies , and music on  .

it really is built to last  .

i think this is the best piece of equipment i have ever bought for my computer  .

bar    none  .

what a price  .

silent , doesn't over    heat  .

weighs less than my 1st gen iphone  .

would definitely recommend , as long as it does not crash or die      )  .

if you're on an serious budget and need an nice external drive for your mac , buy this  .

if you need or want extra memory , i highly recommend this drive  .

i still own the seagate freeagent go that i bought two years ago , so i've had a good experience with seagate products in the past  .

recently , i needed more memory for my music and video files , so i did not hesitate to buy the latest freeagent go model  .

the new design is gorgeous and small  .

the performance and speed is fantastic , and the software is very handy (though i rarely use it)  .

you can customize the drive to auto    play music or video , auto    load your picture    viewing software , or open windows explorer to view the files , etc  .

you cannot go wrong with this external hard drive  .

do not hesitate to email or post any questions .

if you're looking for an excellent portable drive to have your drive file backups on the go , this is it  .

the optional dock accessory is a nice touch as well one thing to note    the usb cord that came with my drive (500gb) is not short like the cnet reviewer pointed out  .

the cord that shipped with my drive is at least a foot long , if not longer  .

for a portable drive , i do not see why you'd want anything longer than that .

i like this product simply because it works , and it works well  .

the 5 year product coverage is also nice .

this is a great drive that is mac compatible (with disk utility reformat)  .

works with time machine and is fast enough for large video/audio transfers  .

best of all its very thin and light .

even though the software is not the best and the short usb can be aggravating at times i would still recommend this to everyone  .

i love my freeagent go and never leave home without it  .

i happened to have some extra room in my freeagent so decided to put some of my favorite portable apps including firefox portable , portable sudoku and a mobile media player (for the media on the drive)  .

so i really suggest giving this drive a try   ) happy researching  .

review the detailed capabilities of the software that allows you to control your data storage and control automaticbackup and built in security  .

street price for 160 gb model is 59 dollars  .

cnet evaluators only considered hw capability did not explain sw in their valulatio  .

poor job .

looks/form   9/10  .

perhaps the greatest reason to buy this particular hard drive  .

it's slim and small , barely bigger in any dimension compared to an iphone  .

it is nice for sg to keep the same curves that the original go had , while updating the style with apple's ideologies in mind  .

the dock just makes it look that much better  .

the lights are a nice sight , especially in the dark  .

they can be turned off performance   8/10  .

speed is on par with my buddy's 320gb wd passport and 250gb simpletech wedge thing  .

transports things fast enough for a 2  .

5in drive , but i've seen better  .

however , what sets this drive apart from the passport is how bloody silent it is , not a single peep from this drive the case is also stone cold after a few hours of transferring large files back and forth  .

while they may be a nice sight to look at , the activity lights are a bit hard to read  .

they go from dim to slightly brighter  .

the threshold between these two states of activity are too subtle to tell what's going on ; but no matter , not a deal breaker for me  .

it's ntfs , so format it mac owners , don't go buying that more expensive mac version (  is up with that , 30 dollars extra to format it in fat32  .

packaged software   4/10  .

honestly , you can make a nice simple looking interface just like the one that this drive comes with , but what good is it if it misses a bunch of files  .

even after updating the software , it still dropped files like it had butterfingers  .

if i hadn't checked the log , i probably would have lost about 500mb of songs and a few sensitive documents the next time i do a clean wipe of my computer  .

get another backup utility , this is rubbish optional accessories   7  .

5/10  .

i got my drive at costco , which meant it also came with the case and optional dock  .

nice deal imo  .

these accessories won't factor into my score  .

the dock makes the hd look awfully nice while the case is a nice and cushy (p)leather material  .

while the dock is just simply a usb2  .

0 a to b connector attached to an aluminum platform , i still like it and think it's a worthy accessory to own  .

the hd is not a finger magnet like the passport , but it can still scratch up  .

the case looks up to the task for protecting the drive  .

you do not need these accessories at all overall   8/10  .

great drive , seagate really delivered with this portable external  .

by far the sleekest looking drive outside of building your own enclosure of course  .

performance is above average when factoring in heat and sound  .

it would definitely make a good stocking stuffer  .

just make sure to replace that weak bundled software that comes with it  .

recommended .

dear experts ,  .

during the data copy , system (external hard disk) abruptly stopped  .

then i removed the hard disk and plug in then system (laptop) say unable to find the software for the usb device even though i had loaded the segate manage software , system unable to find the software for the segate please help me out and s there any way to recover my data from it .

i bought this external hard drive for a backup hard drive when i had computer troubles about 7 months ago  .

last week it wouldn't work  .

i plugged it in and it would not do anything but beep  .

i contacted seagate and they told me i should have backed it up  .

let me repeat  .

back up my back up hard drive  .

this seems like a vicious circle to me  .

so i contacted their sister company that does recovery and they want anywhere from $1000 to $3000 to recover it  .

i could have bought a backup computer for that kind of money  .

i am a college student and a composer and all of my scores and music were on that drive  .

so now because of some cheapskate company i am out all of my compositions and possibly my career as a composer  .

if you think you need something backed up just buy a new computer .

i would not recommend this drive if you want to actually use it as a portable drive  .

if you want to sit it on your desk and never move it it would be perfect  .

but , is not the point of an external hard drive to be able to take it places and take your data with you  .

it just does not stand up to that kind of use  .

i brought mine back after 2 days , because the casing is delaminating  .

i just felt that it is a poorly constructed device and not worth my 70 dollars .

do not buy this drive if you value your data  .

like playing russian roulette .

this drive is seldom used , never dropped and rarely moved , nevertheless after three months of use , the drive abruptly stopped worked  .

seagate could offer little assistance and had no explanation for this error  .

my product is still under warranty so they will replace the drive , however , i must pay for data recovery  .

seagate  .

s response ,  .

next time , backup your data  .

i have seen numerous accounts on the internet account detailing this type of crash , however , seagate will not acknowledge this problem  .

i cannot recommend this product note   seagate refers users to i365 for data recovery  .

expect to pay at least $1200 for this service  .

if your product is under warranty and you would like to make use of another licensed data recovery service , you must provide written proof that the drive case is opened for this purpose in order to receive a replacement product from seagate .

the drive used for nearly one month for regular use  .

the essential data is backed up onto this drive before formating my computer's hdd  .

suddenly one day after connecting it to the desktop it did not show under the explorer , however , the drive name as seagate freeagent is shown in usb connections  .

i have ten different softwares developed on it and suddenly i am in a fix  .

very unreliable usb external drive  .

i am wary of replacing the drive as i will forego the data and labour on developing the same and at the same time will not be compensated by seagate for the same  .

how to recover all the data of almost 100 gb  .

that will cost me a huge amount of money , and surely much much more than what the drive costs  .

one more interesting thing , the drive shows a size of 2  .

2 tb without any free space in seagate manager  .

i am really in a fix because the entire softwares were used in my organisation where i work  .

funny thing is that , if it is being used as a backup tell me do i need to procure another one for backing the data i had on this one and so on please someone tell me what went wrong with this drive and is there any means to recover it  .

i loved this product until a few days ago  .

the drive died and when i contacted seagate i figured out why they can sell them so cheaply  .

they make up their money in support  .

i first tried to reach them through their preferred method , live chat with technical support on their site  .

after waiting 30 minutes for a response (during business hours) i disconnected and called them i explained to the woman on the phone what had happened and she asked if i'd like to try to see if someone in technical support could help retrieve my data  .

i said , yes  .

she then explained that the cost would be $15 to speak to technical support  .

i told her no thank you  .

just replace my drive  .

she then gives me the option of returning the drive using my own packing materials and waiting 2    4 weeks for a new drive or spending $19  .

95 to have them ship me a new drive first and use their materials to return it i'm seeing my story repeated on reviews all over the net and i do not want another seagate drive  .

can someone tell me who makes a reliable portable drive  .

product stopped working after less than 2 months  .

limited warranty does not cover them helping me get my data back off it and if i try to have someone recover the data , my warranty is completely void  .

piece of crap product .

worked fine for 3 months , used it for music storage used maybe a dozen times putting new music on it or using to put new songs on mp3 player  .

all of a sudden started getting messages that it is not working , not being recognized by the pc  .

sometimes not recognized at all , then would see it as an e drive , but no folders , then other times could see folders but no files within i researched seagate's website for hours they need to have a website just for this product/issue  .

i finally had enough and opened a 'ticket' with their support group  .

i asked one single , simple question i had seen so many posts for same issue , but several different solutions i asked if use of a y cable could very well solve the problem i got an email giving me links to the same self tshooting website and of course , i365 link in case i wanted to spend upto $4500/day for them to recover my files seems the desire to offer a good product to the market place is not the intent here , but rather the creation of a whle new profit center within seagate , i365 data recovery no i would not recommend this product and no it is not dropped and no it is never opened .

i cannot reccomend this product to anyone  .

i bought it at the university bookstore and believed the packaging that it is a quality product planned obsolecense  .

this is blantant disreguard for customer satasfaction that is suprising even for a hardware company  .

do not purchase anything from seagate  .

this product sucks and i droped it while i is sitting and it never worked again and the warranty is do not really work .

i shall not buy a seagate again .

after 3 months of use , the hd unexpectedly crashed/died , and now i'm left with a $100 paperweight , and seagate won't even acknowledge there is a problem (even though this is far from an isolated incident    there are endless forum posts with people with the same exact problem)  .

seagate won't replace it since the case is opened , and they wo not pay for data recovery (though , they will provide it for a $500    3000 fee) bottom line , this product is great until it crashed  .

but the fact is , it did crash , and i'm not the only one to have this problem , and seagate is unwilling to admit that there is something defective with this product  .

you're better off spending your money on a more reliable product , and losing out on the design and aesthetic advantages .

it is great , until it fell from the desk  .

the drives are simply to delicate to be used as a portable device  .

the housing in minimized to make the product smaller but it is not enough to protect it from damage  .

using them as portable almost insures they will be vulnerable to some bumps and bruises  .

do not rely on this product as a backup  .

one small drop and they die  .

mine lasted 2 weeks .

i am very very dissatisfied with this product  .

i bought this product less than a year ago to use as extra storage  .

so i stored data on their that i did not store anywhere else  .

i tried all the troubleshooting methods and none of them worked  .

i talked to a seagate agent about the issue and they took forever to respond  .

all in all , they forwarded me to the data recovery website where i contacted another agent  .

the base cost of data recovery is $399 and can go up to as much as $2500  .

i think it's ridiculous to even charge that much  .

i'm very upset about how unreliable this product is  .

i do not recommend it at all .

if you are going to get one you better go ahead and get 5  .

so that you can back up the backup the backup etc .

it suddenly died in just 7 months without any reason at all  .

it is never dropped nor exposed t any heat and humidity  .

i can no longer trust this product and therefore wouldn't recommend at all  .

it's cheaper compared to others however i do not think it would be practical if it fails sooner than expected .

i've had a seagate free agent pro for about a year and have experienced complete meltdown for the second time now  .

i woke this morning to the computer telling me it could not read the external hard drive and would like to know if i want to initialize it  .

the last time this happened , the rep asked me if i shook the hard drive  .

what  .

why would i shake the thing  .

better yet , why do they this sell crap on the shelves that potentially will destroy all your data  .

the guy said there is a possibility that the data can be recovered at my cost  .

why should i have to pay for the poor performance of this crappy device  .

i realize , again , that i should not rely on an external hard drive for storage , but i will never buy a seagate again  .

this is ridiculous  .

stop selling us crap seagate  .

i bought two drives  .

stored office data , software downloads etc on one (critical) , and music and videos on the other the one with the music and videos has stopped working within a month of purchase  .

do not know the trigger / cause  .

just stopped working one day seems like a power failure as the drive light keeps flashing on and off  .

lost all data  .

also lost trust in the product  .

have backed the other drive up onto a wd drive  .

unlikely to use it again  .

lost all data  .

also lost trust in the product  .

have backed the other drive up onto a wd drive  .

unlikely to buy seagate products in the future .

a waste of money i'm glad we can return it .
