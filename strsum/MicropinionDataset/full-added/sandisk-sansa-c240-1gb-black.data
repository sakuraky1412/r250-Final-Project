para los que buscan el mejor negocio , de un fabricante de reputacion sinceramente lo puedo recomendar .
this mp3 player is the best i've owned for what is was made to do and that's why i rated it 10  .
the picture quality did not quite make it , compared to my 8gb insignia pilot (2  .
4 in screen) , but it's still okay  .
also unlike the insignia , i'm not afraid of breaking this mp3 player  .
it's built sturdy and strong  .
i totally recommend this mp3 player to you .
sorry cnet , you missed the target on your review  .
i am an audio technician/sound engineer , so i hope my opinion helps those looking for the most bang for the buck first off , through the included headphones out the window , they are worthless  .
not uncommon in this price range  .
grab a decent pair right from the start  .
i recomnemd jvc ha    fx33  .
the have soft foam rubber inserts that fit and stay put  .
the sound competes with bose earbuds , which i have in my studio , and cost more than they were worth the features of this little player are fantastic  .
yes , it does support album art  .
seems many reviewers don't realize this for some strange reason  .
the eq has presets , but better yet , it has a custom setting for getting the sound just right  .
perfect for serious listeners playlist support , listing by groups , such as artist , song , etc , make it simple to use  .
the screen is plenty bright and easy to read  .
let's face it , screens this small are not good for viewing photos , i do not care what brand you buy  .
what it is good for , is easy to read menus and album art the fm radio works well , and has presets  .
it records from the radio if desired  .
the built in mike records voice  .
the built in rechargable battery charges when it is connectred to a usb port  .
works for 15 hours on a single charge  .
there is an external memory card slot for mini sd cards i love this little player , and use it often  .
i own a music studio with over 200 , 000 dollars of audio equipment , and i chose this little player for personal iistening , after trying about 20 different players , from the cheapest to the most expensive  .
this is my recommended player mike shillow  .
bigmike studios  .
lincoln , ne  .
i thought this mp3 player is perfect for me  .
many features for the price  .
better than new ipod shuffle for less price  .
it has a screen , which is what i wanted  .
if i wanted a larger , more clear screen , to play videos , i would have bought a higher priced mp3 player  .
i got just what i wanted in this player , something to play music with a screen .
i love this mp3 player  .
it plays well and even supports anr headsets  .
light weight and inconspicuous  .
it's nice to find a product that doesn't draw attention to itself making you a target for theives this mp3 player is definitely worth the price  .
my only gripe is , it is easily scratched and there are not many accessories such as sleeve available for it yet .
startup like anything takes a few seconds and depending on the memcard size can take a few extra  .
what is the cnet reveiwer smoking when rating this  .
why should i pay twice as much for an ipod tha doesn't have nearly have the fetures  .
the battery life is outstanding as well  .
i've forgot to turn it off a few times and used only half the life in just under 24hrs  .
can ipod users say the same  .
my bother has an ipod and it does not hold a charge as well with the c240 you have a voice recorderor can recode fm  .
make a playlist of songs you listen to more often on the unit  .
sure be nice to videos but can wait til get home to watch them  .
comes with usb cable and sansa media converter  .
uses windows media player to transfer  .
took me approx 2 minutes to fill with 196 (mp3) songs depending on size (wma will allow more storage  .
this player deserves respect  .
i use it in my car along w/ a tape adapter  .
it's easy to switch to the next song with out taking my eyes off the road  .
it's small enough to slide into my jean pocket and go for a walk  .
the storage capacity is expandable by adding a micro sd card  .
it's easy to preset favorite fm stations w/ the digital tuner  .
this is a great device for music but the small screen makes it impracticable as a photo viewer .
the fm tuner is great  .
i work in a cold storage area and the tuner gets reception evenwhere my samsung sync with 3g wo not sound quality is really good many levels of volume control with a normal and high feature  .
compact size is small but not oh how cute the one gig is not bad the expandable sdmicro is sweet if you want a no fuss mp3 player to listen to music you found it .
this little mp3 is great  .
we use media player to download the songs and pictures to the mp3 player  .
it's easy to use  .
the headphone jack quit working and the company replaced the player  .
get value for the price .
this unit has a lot of potential  .
i added a 2 gb sd card and use it primarily for audio books  .
therefore controlling the order the tracks are played is most important  .
with this , and i suspect most mp3 players that need software to load them , the order is very difficult to control  .
i finally mastered it after about 20 hr working with media player 10  .
the audio recorder is far better than the dmp    100 i previously used , however that unit is very easy to set up the files to play sequentially in the correct order  .
it is no exaduration to say that the display is almost unreadable in sunlight  .
the tech support from sandisk is very good  .
they provide an automatic firmware updater that will check for updates and install them  .
it is totally painless and works very well  .
the version that came with the player did not recognize my unit , however , i downloaded one from the web site and it worked just fine .
i got this player and it has worked great  .
the only regret i had is when i try to navigate through a song you have to hold in the button and it moves in incremets of 20 seconds  .
this is annoying if you are trying to find a point in a song  .
cnet is off the mark here .
i bought this player because i really don't like to search for music on a player and i perfer random shuffling of the music that i am currently interested in  .
the player is nice because you can wear the necklace strap and listen to your music from there without having to worry about it getting crushed in your pocket  .
i really do not have any complaints about it because it is a wonderful value for only a little over $70  .
if you want an alternative to shuffle , with a screen  .
this is the one to go with  .
i don't know where the c    net reviewer got the idea into her head about no album art viewing  .
all you have to do us push the silver square button in the middle of the control pad when the song is playing to view the album art (that's saying that you downloaded the album art file with your mp3's)  .
i have found nothing wrong with this player so far  .
what you get for the money far exceeds my expectations  .
like another reviewer said on here it does not matter if the screen is washed out it's not like your are going to be checking your email or surfing the web on this thing  .
i have found nothing wrong with the audio quality on this either  .
it sounds crystal clear and the included headphones are better than i expected they would be  .
i like the fact that you charge the unit straight through the included usb sync cable  .
if you are in the market for a mp3 player under $100 , this is definately the unit i recommend .
when my ipod shuffle bit the dust (it is treated rough , and lasted a very long time , before i finaly broke it) , i decided i wanted to ditch ipod and itunes and go for a monthly go music plan  .
i am not a ipod hater i loved mine , i just wanted to try something new  .
the sansa works great with napster go  .
i use my mp3 player for tredmil or dog walking time , so i have no need for video , album art , or anything else  .
it is a great little player and has many more options then i thought it would (i got mine at walmart for $49) , it has the normal settings for brightness , contrast , power options , equalizer , ect plus it can store photo's , has a fm radio , and can record voice  .
mine is the 1 gb , but also has the sd slot to expand the memory  .
if you just need a basic mp3 player for music then the sansa c240 is a great choice .
speaking in the realm of mp3 players (not to dilute the term with expensive multimedia features) , i think potential buyers will get more than their money's worth out of the sansa c240  .
even though the panel might not do your photos justice , it's still sleek , cheaper than apple's equally equipped ipods , and the potential 1gb of songs is more than enough for everyday use outside the comfort of your home or on short vacations  .
i have not found any reason yet not to invest in one for light use while you're on the go .
cnet editors are all bias or , they are all bought by apple if it is not apple , it is no good i have listen to many podcast of cnet's editors many of them have similar attitude apple stuff is good  .
go buy it  .
this is my first mp3 player  .
the reason i got it is because i could not find the one i wanted and thought i might have made a mistake  .
after getting it going i tell you this thing is nice  .
to me anyway the sound is very good and gets very very loud  .
the user controls get a little getting used to but is fine , you should be good at them in about the first hour or so  .
the look is nice , not to big but not to small  .
i got the 1 gig , why get the 2gig when it has a port for a micro sd card  .
yes that is very nice  .
the screen is not a plasma but looks fine  .
i can see how it could scratch easy but i think most are like this okay the manual does not tell you everything you need to know though so you need to play with it  .
i had it all down in less than an hour but i read a lot on it things you need to do    .
go to sandisk  .
com and download the sansa firmware updater (http  //sandisk  .
com/retail/default  .
aspx  .
catid  1376) you will need an update , then it will update it when you plug it in when needed 2  .
after you play with the songs that it comes with (3    4) and before you start to put your own on format it in the setting  .
this will get rid of all the stuff you do not want 3  .
you just copy and paste songs to the sandisk player , you do not need to put them in any file  .
what i did is made files for each band then just copied the whole file (10 songs or what ever in the files) to the player  .
this will keep things neat and you will not have to go through everything to delete things i would suggest this in a heart beat  .
i'm not here to make up your mind for you but for the money it very nice  .
i like it over the ipod shuffle i hope this helps you  .
vince  .
the review cnet posted on this player shows me they are biased against almost anything other than apple  .
you are 100% correct soup in saying cnet's review is useless  .
it should be trashed  .
jasmine , wake up please  .
how does cnet give the ipod shuffle a 6  .
3 and the sansa c240 a 6  .
bias , that is how  .
the ipod shuffle has no screen , no fm radio , no fm recorder , no voice recorder , no micro sd slot , no user replaceable battery and it is 79  .
99 the sansa c240 has a screen , a fm radio , fm recorder , voice recorder , micro sd slot , and a user replaceable battery  .
it is also 79  .
the only thing the ipod shuffle has out of the box , the sansa c240 doesn't , is the built on clip  .
the sansa does have a lanyard out of the box though jasmine france , you are biased  .
you say the c240 has a boring user interface  .
at least it has an interface  .
do you expect fireworks when you press play  .
you also say it has no video playback neither does the shuffle  .
oh yea , the shuffle does not have a screen  .
this review is 100% biased  .
cnet's review should be taken down immediately  .
the c200 series is a great improvement from the sandisk m200 series with better user interface , recharchable battery and a fm radio function that allows the player to record live radio  .
the c200 series is one of the better low cost mp3 player in todays market  .
it even looks stylish when hangged on around the neck with a provided sandisk linyard best regards ,  .
dan maldonado  .
cnet's review is useless  .
this is a small mp3    player , that you put in your pocket and listen to the music  .
talking about how boring the display is , is stupid , since this is something you only look at while changin song or settings  .
then it goes to your pocket and with this tiny screen , who would want to use it for watching pictures anyways  .
what a completely useless review  .
well as i stated in the summary , this is very basic and not for advanced users , as it doesnt support video , or any other advanced features  .
it has all the features a first time user would need and with some nice controls  .
i think that sandisk did a good job with the layout and controls , and if you have the companion mp3 player the e200 you can use the same usb connector  .
the picture quality is very poor , not clear and very bright  .
i wouldnt use this player as a multimedia player , just for music  .
the buttons lite up blue when the player is on so its easy to see in dark areas  .
the outside buttons are rubber so they are easy to feel and press  .
it has a clear glossy finish on the front as it attracts fingerprints  .
the micro sd slot is a nice touch as it only comes in 1 and 2 gb configurations  .
the battery life is ok , not great , as i got about 14    17 hours of life out of it  .
it sync easily with the computer with wmp 10 , i havent tried out wmp 11 but i suppose it would work overall i would get this as a substitute to a ipod video or ipod nano  .
i think that sandisk did a good job as this is a good entry level mp3 player  .
i would maybe consider it over a ipod shuffle , but that is what you think  .
if you want a better mp3 at about the same price , save up 20 dollars to get the creative zen v or v plus much better build and better sound quality  .
i got this at best buy , for about 69  .
99 (on sale for 10 off) .
i bought myself one of these and installed rockbox to use in place of the built    in firmware  .
i can still boot to the original firmware , but i never do because rockbox provides so many features , including support of high capacity micro    sd cards  .
with the built in firmware , only 2gb cards can be used  .
rockbox has many features including on    the    go playlist generation , text    file reader , customizable while    playing    screen , bookmarking , voice menus , video playback , games , tuner and metronome  .
to see if the sansa is rockbox compatible check the firmware version  .
the v1 hardware uses firmware named 01  .
xx , while the v2 hardware uses firmware beginning with 03 .
it's amazing the dichotomy between editor reviews and user opinions ; not just on this product , but many others  .
cnet editors do not seem to have a clue what people are looking for in these products and they often give high ratings to cheaply made , over    priced junk  .
about all cnet is good for is the user ratings , which give shoppers an idea of what the real    world experience will be like the sandisk sansa works well , has great features , and is durable  .
that , cnet , is what customers are looking for  .
i just bought this player and it is my first  .
i do not care about great color screens and such just music  .
hey cnet  .
about the sound quality your right but it is not the player it's the earphones that suck  .
i plugged in my mb quart headphones and although not meant for mp3 players volume is low but the sound quality is great for the$$  .
i am ordering eaphones from ebay for $5  .
98 including shipping from a seller that has great stuff for next to nothing  .
that will solve the sound quality issue  .
i believe cnet is apple    bought also  .
this is a great player for cheap  .
i am very pleased with this player  .
i did alot of research before making my purchase and for the price this is the best product by far  .
i paid a little extra and purchased the 2 gig player and it holds more than enough songs for me  .
i am also very impressed with the battery life  .
the only complaints that i have is it should have come with a carrying case and software that will help organize your music  .
i have used yahoo music but feel i'm limited on what i can do as opposed to if there is software for this particular player available  .
i would also say that the customer service department is horrible  .
i called them regarding a couple of questions and just gave up  .
they were not helpful at all  .
anyway i is able to figure out the questions myself after messing with the player for awhile  .
overall i would highly recommend this player to anyone just wanted a good quality product that will be used for music downloading purposes .
got this player for christmas , and the cnet review is off in a few places 1  .
the player does display album art , but this functionality will only work through the sync feature on windows media player version 10 and above  .
you access the art by pushing the play button when the song is playing 2  .
yes the fm presets are not numbered , but without a keypad on the player , you might not miss it have to agree with the other reviewers that the documentation is pretty bad  .
the instructions are for a very old version of media player , but you need wmp 10 or above to get the album , album art , and file management features to work properly  .
tying battery charging to the usb cable is not documented .
i do not understand the 6  .
0 from the cnet editors  .
the main complain is about the screen but who cares  .
nobody will use it to display pictures from the last vacations the sound quality is a lot better than my old iriver ifp    790 i added a 1 gigabytes microsd and i am a very happy camper .
we got this unit as an ipod mini replacement for our teenage daughter (actually got the 2 gig model)  .
the unit is easy to use and to transfer music to using yahoo music (where she gets most of her tunes) or by 'drag and drop' while in the msc mode  .
it charges quickly from the usb port and we've picked up an ac charger for this and my e280 (btw , igo has just announced a 'tip' for the unit so you don't have to carry a whole charger while on the road) it's not in competition with the nano , i leave that to the e280 which outshines that unit , imho , but is clearly better than the shuffle  .
the screen , for all it's small size , it a great plus over the shuffle in that you can select the music you want to hear and the increased capacity , up to 4 gigs if you want to add a microsd card , is also an advantage for the price it's a fine unit for teens who do not insist on the ipod mystique as well as a second player for the gym , jogging , etc .
this review by cnet blew me away  .
after spending a great deal looking at many mp3 players , i definitely do not find this one to be unusually boring  .
in fact , it's pretty cute  .
and the sound is not bad , either we bought this for a young relative (she's 9) and in no time , with very little help , she had songs loaded and is having a great time with it if you do not need video or lots of storage , this is definitely worth looking at  .
i bought this for my wife after she brought my discman and studio headphones to go work out , and we decided it is time to enter the 21st century i had our music stored on our computer in mp3 format , but changed it to wma so i could cram her beatles collection onto the device  .
i used mediamonkey to convert the mp3s and sync the wma files to the computer , and thought it went relatively quickly (a little more than a second per song) cnet gave this player poor marks for sound quality  .
while i'm not blown away by the sound , i do not notice its limitations my wife is a big am radio listener , so although it's not hip , it would be nice to have a player that can do am radio the player is light enough to have it suspended from its headphone cable when the earbuds are in my ears , yet it does not feel cheap or lightly made for $60 , i cannot think of a better player .
my husband got me this player so i could listen to audiobooks from netlibrary  .
within 2 weeks i gave it to my son and got a creative zen v plus instead  .
the sandisk does play the audiobooks , but unless you're going to listen to an entire book in one sitting , it's better not to  .
the fast forward works in increments of 20 sec , so when i lost my place in hour #6 of the boleyn inheritance , i had to press ff for 20 minutes to find my place  .
then i hit the wrong button , and whammo , it is gone again this player is fine if you want a basic music player at a low price , but if you want to listen to audiobooks , go for the creative zen  .
with the zen , you can hit a button and put a bookmark in your book  .
also , the ff feature speeds up the longer you hold it down .
the c240 is good little player small but useable and it has the photo viewer and it has an easy to replace battery  .
my main complaint is that it is not compatible with several subscription servces like audible or real even though the models below and above it are .
it does support album art cover  .
this players great if your looking for a good inexpensive quality mp3 player  .
the battery's life is shortened if you use it too often .
i purchased 2 , one for my wife and another for myself  .
this is my first player , and so far i like it a lot  .
getting started is a little difficult , loaded songs would not show up or play , solution is to update firmware  .
one bit of advice for anyone buying one , go to the scandisk website and download the automatic firmware upgrade program , then check for updates  .
(even though ours were purchased at the same time from the same store , they each had different f/w versions  .
) do this first because anything you loaded into the player will be lost with the new f/w  .
overall , we are happy with them .
this is my first mp3 and i wanted something to take on planes or trips  .
it would be nice to have large high quatlity pictures but then you need to spend over a hundred $ and they get pretty big  .
this unit is very small , light and seems to be very well made  .
i got the 1 gb unit (the c250 is 2 gb) but since i won't need more than 500 songs and since the screen is pretty small i wo not be viewing movies or pictures  .
the unit has added slot for a micro chip if i need more songs  .
the back slides off to replace the battery but i see that sandisk only carries the battery for the e200 series  .
i assume they will offer more accessories later  .
great unit for only $70  .
my husband bought this for me about a year ago  .
i always take it out when i am walking or doing outside chores  .
my only complaints are    .
locks up on a song from time to time  .
you end up having to take the battery out for it to shut off and restart  .
thats the only way to get it unlocked 2  .
display is very hard to see  .
i have a protective cover made by sansa that i put my mp3 player in  .
for some reason its hard to see the graphics (when you are scrolling through the songs) there should be a contrast button or menu option 3  .
when holding and trying to adjust volume , its too easy to hit the record button  .
i have done this several times other than that i really do like it  .
it is cheap and does what it says it does .
actually this is pretty good for the money , cos i just bought it 2 days ago on sale at fry's for only 49  .
99 so yeah cannot complain it has the radio , even with it's recorder , and built    in mic to record the voice , and this other feature which i'm about to say is sooo useless pic viewer , cos the screen is sooo impossible , lo res and all washed out but the biggest lackness that pisses me off is that it has a very terrible sound quality  .
this is so vital  .
even my small panasonic sv    mp010 has the amazingly great quality of sound and so loud  .
but it died few days ago so forget about it hmm i wouldn't reccomend this to you all , but for the sake of the money i mean 49  .
c'mon who wouldn't get lured for it  .
and dang  .
now i'm trapped between so    so player and the great deal damn so as i told you cannot complain it's up to you now , want a many features in a small price and do not really mind the sound quality  .
go for it  .
otherwise you'd rather spend your money for the sansa m240 for almost likely comes with the same features but very basic screen for 39  .
99 at circuit city (i've heard many ppl satisfied with the sound quality)  .
good luck  .
sandisk sansa c240 (1gb) is a better buy than the ipod shuffle becuase it has a screen , fm tuner , voice recorder , micro sd slot , picture gallery (even though quality is poor)  .
for both mp3 players @ a price of $80 the sansa is a better buy with the features under its belt .
when i first bought this i thought it is terrible  .
now that i have had it for a few weeks i have found it is useful for music and podcasts but has a useless technical manual  .
good display for its size  .
(it does show album art in spite of what the review says  .
) handles wma up to 320 but not lossless .
personally , i cant stand ipod or zune  .
i wanted a player that doesn't lock me into a particular media format , and i do not want to pay for a name  .
i think ipods are terribly overrated and zune is too new  .
after some research i decided on the sansa c240 because i currently have a rhapsody    to    go (ehh so so) subscription , and the player is compatible  .
overall , its a decent player for the price , sound is ok , but you will need to play with the custom eq to get a decent sound  .
fm tuner is nice , voice recorder a good bonus  .
the ipod shuffle does not even offer a screen so the sansa has the shuffle beat hands down the bad several times , songs have quit playing after 50 or 60 seconds and started playing the next track  .
shuffle is not engaged , and i cant seem to get an answer as to why some tracks are cut short  .
the display , while nice that it is included has terrible contrast , so much so that i cannot even see which track is highlighted when selecting music  .
if you turn it way on its side and look at it from an extreme angle , you can just see what's selected  .
other than these issues this is a good player for the price .
this is not a very good mp3 player if you're looking for quality that will last for a while  .
i got mine for christmas , and by march i had to replace it already  .
by the middle of jan  .
i had to replace the headphones , because the left one blew out  .
also , i've only had this one since march and it already is not working  .
my computer won't read it and even if the the usb cord is plugged in , it won't respond and sometimes wo not even turn on without having to do it a few times  .
this did work well though for a period of time  .
just be careful .
my experience is bad , so i'd say do not buy it , but keep in mind that every single mp3 player out there has a billion such stories  .
the system needs to change (planned obsolescence anyone  .
when i click on the samba c240 icon in windows explorer , it literally takes 2 minutes for it to respond  .
when it does , and i click on one of the other folders ( music ) , it takes another 2 minutes  .
it's totally unusable  .
i've rebooted and installed the software that came with it , still the same problems  .
i'm returning it .
i've had this mp3 player for about 6 months and at first is very impressed with its versatility and battery life and its easy , straightforward playing of the mp3s i fed it  .
later i discovered its extreme sensivity to heat (do not dare let it sit in the sun if you want to use it) as it will freeze after becoming anything more than warm in your hand  .
this is its greatest fault and downfall  .
if files are corrupted , you'll have to use the internal format command to wipe its internal memory and refill it with files  .
it now no longer will boot past the splash screen after the latest overheating incident in which i tried to transfer files to it while it sat in a ~90 degree room when overheating is not an issue , it is a breeze to use with my computer to transfer files  .
the battery life is very nice on the internal rechargeable (i hate replacing aaas) as long as you're willing to keep it refrigerated while using it , you should have no problems  .
i find it unacceptable .
i bought 3 for xmas  .
i could not get the first two to work with my music service  .
i called sandisk at least 8 times over 2 days  .
i had a case number , but each time i called the person had no idea of what is already done  .
after we had exhausted all chances of a fix (they never admitted the devices were defective) , i asked that they insure i get a full refund for the opened ones  .
they refused  .
i will never go back to sandisk for any product .
purchased thru dell , missing parts , 3    4 week wait to receive missing parts from sandisk .

Expandable Memory with MicroSD Slot, Customizable EQ, Simple Interface with Windows Media Player, Screen at the price of a shuffle, Replaceable battery; Bad Screen, Cheap Plastic Feel.
The price, not cheap, micro SD card, size, screen; Manual is not to good, no clip
Compact, friendly GUI, a novel FM and voice recorder, micro-SD slot for more memory, rechargeable via USB port; Poor display for photos, no protective carriers made for this model yet
Great if you need a player for music only, rechargable battery, sd slot; not for a user that wants video, or album art with songs
Packed full of features for the$$; No the screen is not great who cares??? View photos on your other toys!
Simple to use, has a sufficient amount of storage, and has fm tuner +fm and voice recording.; Controlls are a bit rough, small screen.
The e200 lil Brother, Ability to add Playlist, Nice on-screen navigation, FM Radio, and photo viewer; can do everything the e200 series does except play Video
Small, very good sound quality, easy to use; Need software for product, customer service stinks, need case
clear screen, good volume control, lots of different features.; mine broke upon having it for less than 6 months, some of the songs don't show up with names, just numbers and or letters, turns off whenever it wants to, headphones break within months of having it.
Simple interface, versatile, internal battery (good battery life), SD memory expansion slot; Crashes/freezes up when it gets hot (or even moderately warm), leading to file corruption or nonbootable player if it freezes during transfers, proprietary USB cable, does not support SDHC memory cards
It has all the features one would need and a MicroSD slot. I was surprised by the good sound quality. Best bang for the buck.; Screen is far from perfect.
Ability to Run RockBox (v1 models only). Nice small size. Low Price; If it is version 2.0 you can not run RockBox (don't go by what is printed on the case, check the firmware version). Small display
Blue backlight, easy to navigate, Micro SD slot for future expansion.; No video support, but hey... what can you expect from an MP3 player that is so inexpensive?
Screen, User Replaceable Battery, Micro SD slot, FM radio, FM Recorder, Voice Recorder, and you can download pictures to it...ALL FOR LESS than $80!!; Comes with a lanyard, but no belt clip...again, this isn't negative on the player, just the accessory...player seems great! IGNORE CNET's REVIEW!
Bought just over 2 years ago to replace my portable cd player. Was the best choice I made. Very worth the cost. Has an additional micro memory slot. Though specs of product at time said 1GB mem card expandable I added a larger 2GB. NO FLAWS; The only 2 minor conflict I have with it is that when you play a slide show with music, if you stop the slide show then the music stops. Would have been nice if they gave an option of continuous music after exiting slideshow.
It was easy to use, small, and the sound quality was passable.; It stopepd working after a month or two. It was great while it lasted, but now it is a $60 case for my spare microSD card.
replacable battery, can add micro SD chip, pretty simple, good sound and lots of features such as FM radio, instant record, nice and small, works great; instruction manual very poor for a first time user, have trouble safe disconnect from computer if not done correctly it won't turn on after disconnect., requires software program to store pics
