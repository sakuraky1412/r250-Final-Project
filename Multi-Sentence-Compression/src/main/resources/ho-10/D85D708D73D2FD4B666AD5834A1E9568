we actually preferred the breakfast downstairs but if you want a less busy breakfast it 's fine to have breakfast in the executive lounge .

it had a city view and while it was the level expected in a 5* hotel i could n't help but think it lacked the wow factor of other 5* hotels we have frequented .

having booked a standard room we opted to upgrade to the executive floors for $ 40 per night per room this included several benefits most notably access to the lounge for evening cocktails/appetisers and refreshments throughout the day .

this upgrade also included breakfast for the rooms occupants ( 2 persons ) in my opinion this was great value if you make use of these benefits !
