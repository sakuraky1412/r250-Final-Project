there was a relatively cheap remodel about 5-6 years ago , they even had staff doing the painting !
• the valet guys , coffee shop ladies and mavis in the gym are still here and delivering a great service .
• i stayed in sept with my family were supposed to be here for 2 weeks as we’ve been coming here for a number of years , but hurricane irma came along a few days after we arrived unfortunately .
• you’re attending a conference , possibly !
so a professional hotel could not even be bothered to write a specific note to their guests instead a generic staff announcement , how lazy are they here , seriously ?
• we kept asking for information and got almost nothing but we had the feeling the hotel would suddenly decide they would close and provide us with limited warning .
the hotel wasn’t that busy and instead of really helping international guests we were provided with zero help from the hotel which is actually both shocking and shameful .
• sadly they’ve also closed the john craig clothing store in the lobby also now which was a great little shop .
no not really !
luckily , we took our own initiative and checked out ahead of time and made our way up to washington over the next 48 hrs by car before the hurricane hit but with zero help and communication from the rc naples management team .
