so if you are traveling with dogs and on a budget , then this is the spot for you !
i was unaware of the dog possibility ( must not have done my homework carefully ) and upon arrival , dogs on leashes everywhere including a great dane across the hall - thought it was a horse , as i herded two young grandsons age 2 and 3 into the room .
we arrived at 2:00pm and just went to the pool with the kids til check in .
two of the front desk staff were pleasant and smiled , the third was a bit surly .
seems the hotel staff ( from europe with little command of the english language ) takes their lunch break around 2:00pm as they were all having lunch in the breakfast room when we arrived .
i understand now why rooms were not always ready or why housekeeping was slow to respond .
however , our room was nice and clean and we had 2 queen beds .
wifi , tv , lights and fridge all worked which is always a plus .
this la quinta i 'm sure takes a serious beating during spring break and the summer months as it is so convenient to moody gardens and schlitterbahn and across from the rocky portion of the beach .
with that in mind it is probably not in the best shape overall as spring breakers use and abuse .
there are newer properties behind and next door but may be more expensive and less pet friendly .
the breakfast was just fine but it was crowded every morning with guests jostling for the waffle makers .
patience is required .
my one request would be that they offered some rooms for only humans .
i prefer not sharing a room with umpteen previous dog guests as i 'm not a dog lover .
now give me a cat and i 'm just fine !
also , might be nice if the human rooms were all on one floor - human guests left their dog next door and all he did was bark while they were out to dinner .
very inconsiderate and annoying !
you know who you are !
for the right guest , this hotel is perfect .
me , not so much , even though we are lq members and stay frequently at much nicer la quinta properties .
