GLOSSY SCREENS ARE THE STUPIDEST INVENTION OF THIS MILLENIUM .
4 DO NOT GET WAX ON YOUR SCREEN .
0 out of 5 stars Bad LCD Screen, October 7, 2009
Screen brightness is very satisfactory .
Hard to see full web pages on small screen, resolution inadequate .
only 10, inch screen, small keyboard and no CD, ROM .
1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several toolbars have been turned on .
Long battery life, sharp looking machine, fingerprint magnet,glossy screen=glare,ease of use and portability .
pretty decent screen quality .
Blue screen crashed several times .
Very nice, in fact, though I strongly dislike glossy screens ,  no matter, I knew it would have one when I ordered it .
9  screens, but felt that was too much of a sacrifice .
Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .
1 inch screens, Windows XP operating systems, a plethora of USB ports, a card reader, WiFi and most have a few color choices .
I began by considering netbooks with screens smaller than the now, standard 10 .
just a big dark, screen paperweight .
Also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the DVD .
5 PASS ,  Screen is bright and large enough .
The screen size works just fine for me .
It's small with a very clear screen .
