this/DT hotel/NN has/VBZ a/DT few/JJ good/JJ assetts/NNS and/CC could/MD so/RB easily/RB be/VB transormed/VBN into/IN a/DT great/JJ hotel/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT little/JJ competent/JJ management/NN ./.

firstly/RB ,/, location/NN ./.

this/DT is/VBZ a/DT a/DT real/JJ breath/NN of/IN fresh/JJ air/NN compared/VBN to/TO the/DT crowded/JJ tourist/NN traps/NNS of/IN bowness/NN and/CC ambleside/NN ./.

there/EX is/VBZ good/JJ walking/NN in/IN every/DT direction/NN from/IN the/DT swan/NN ./.

the/DT second/JJ assett/NN is/VBZ the/DT food/NN ./.

if/IN you/PRP want/VBP basic/JJ ,/, then/RB the/DT battered/VBN fish/NN and/CC chips/NNS is/VBZ above/IN the/DT average/NN ,/, but/CC other/JJ dishes/NNS on/IN then/RB menu/NN are/VBP to/TO a/DT good/JJ restaurant/NN standard/NN ./.

the/DT special/JJ on/IN one/CD night/NN was/VBD a/DT delicious/JJ duo/NN of/IN salmon/NN and/CC haddock/NN ,/, with/IN lemon/JJ sauce/NN ,/, served/VBD with/IN herb/NN mash/NN ./.

at/IN breakfast/NN ,/, the/DT high/JJ standard/NN continues/VBZ ,/, with/IN teh/NN best/JJS ingredients/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- eg/FW the/DT king/NN of/IN black/JJ pudding/NN sourced/VBD from/IN stornoway/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, all/DT well/RB cooked/VBN ,/, without/IN the/DT greasiness/NN of/IN so/RB many/JJ full/JJ breakfasts/NNS ./.

the/DT management/NN of/IN the/DT swan/NN is/VBZ however/RB appalling/JJ ./.

checkin/NN was/VBD in/IN theory/NN from/IN 4:00/CD pm/NN ,/, later/RB than/IN the/DT average/JJ hotel/NN ,/, yet/RB there/EX were/VBD still/RB people/NNS waiting/VBG in/IN reception/NN for/IN their/PRP$ rooms/NNS to/TO be/VB ready/JJ at/IN 4:30/CD ./.

in/IN our/PRP$ case/NN ,/, during/IN checkin/VBG the/DT staff/NN lost/VBD our/PRP$ registration/NN card/NN -LRB-/-LRB- the/DT bit/NN you/PRP normally/RB use/VBP as/IN proof/NN of/IN signature/NN for/IN extras/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, but/CC we/PRP managed/VBD without/IN ./.

at/IN dinner/NN ,/, time/NN and/CC again/RB ,/, the/DT waitresses/NNS wandered/VBD around/RP with/IN dishes/NNS asking/VBG each/DT table/NN in/IN turn/NN if/IN they/PRP were/VBD what/WP the/DT guests/NNS had/VBD ordered/VBN ./.

breakfast/NN was/VBD much/RB the/DT same/JJ ,/, with/IN guests/NNS waiting/VBG a/DT long/JJ time/NN to/TO order/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB watching/VBG dishes/NNS arrive/VBP in/IN an/DT ad/NN hoc/FW fashion/NN ,/, in/IN no/DT particular/JJ order/NN ,/, and/CC again/RB with/IN little/JJ knowledge/NN by/IN the/DT staff/NN of/IN who/WP had/VBD ordered/VBN what/WDT ./.

to/TO be/VB fair/JJ ,/, the/DT staff/NN worked/VBD hard/RB ./.

top/JJ marks/NNS went/VBD to/TO the/DT barman/NN ,/, who/WP wrestled/VBD with/IN taking/VBG drinks/NNS orders/NNS ,/, and/CC serving/VBG food/NN to/TO 3/CD different/JJ lounge/NN areas/NNS ,/, while/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT staff/NN focussed/VBN on/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.

on/IN decor/NN and/CC cleanliness/NN ,/, suffice/VBP it/PRP to/TO say/VB that/IN some/DT areas/NNS of/IN the/DT hotel/NN are/VBP very/RB tired/JJ ./.

the/DT common/JJ theme/NN then/RB ,/, is/VBZ a/DT bunch/NN of/IN hard/JJ working/VBG staff/NN ,/, in/IN a/DT hotel/NN in/IN a/DT great/JJ location/NN ,/, and/CC serving/VBG great/JJ food/NN ,/, who/WP just/RB need/VBP a/DT bit/NN of/IN common/JJ sense/NN management/NN to/TO organise/VB them/PRP properly/RB ./.

final/JJ point/NN ,/, i/FW noticed/VBD one/CD reviewer/NN who/WP complained/VBD of/IN dogs/NNS in/IN the/DT bar/NN ./.

we/PRP stayed/VBD at/IN the/DT swan/NN because/IN we/PRP were/VBD travelling/VBG with/IN our/PRP$ dog/NN ,/, but/CC i/FW can/MD appreciate/VB that/IN for/IN people/NNS who/WP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB dogs/NNS ,/, the/DT swan/NN may/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT best/JJS place/NN ,/, as/IN there/EX are/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN them/PRP ,/, although/IN to/TO be/VB fair/JJ dogs/NNS are/VBP not/RB allowed/VBN in/IN the/DT main/JJ restaurant/NN ./.

in/IN fact/NN ,/, grasmere/NN is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT most/RBS dog/NN friendly/JJ place/NN i/FW have/VBP visited/VBN in/IN the/DT uk/NN ,/, with/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT shops/NNS bearing/VBG ``/`` dogs/NNS welcome/JJ ''/'' stickers/NNS ./.

for/IN non-dog/JJ lovers/NNS ,/, its/PRP$ safer/JJR to/TO ask/VB when/WRB booking/VBG whether/IN dogs/NNS are/VBP allowed/VBN or/CC not/RB ./.

the/DT opposite/NN of/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ago/RB when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD difficult/JJ for/IN those/DT of/IN us/PRP with/IN canine/JJ friends/NNS to/TO find/VB hotels/NNS !/.
