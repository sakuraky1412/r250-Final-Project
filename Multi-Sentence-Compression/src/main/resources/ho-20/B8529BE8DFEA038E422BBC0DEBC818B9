then on top of that , no breakfast included , $ 20 a day for valet parking ( which is about 20 yards around the back of the hotel ) and $ 75 dollars each night for the extra person , which was in the small print - so by far the most expensive stay on our road trip , and we stayed at great places .

final little moan is that the room was not cleaned until 5pm , and as we were only there two days it did n't give us any chance to relax in the room , we ended up hovering outside in the communal area while the maids did their work .
the room was fine for two , but we were a party of three and it was quite cramped when the sofa bed was up .
