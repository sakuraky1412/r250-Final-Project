breakfastincluded in the room rate , it was largely a self-service affair – staff did not appear unless you rang the bell for service .
given the hotel’s size , room rate – and compared with other leading european boutique hotels – i expected a far greater level of service .
public areasthese are definitely the primary selling point – a garden with outdoor seating area , and two beautiful lounges and a reading room charmingly decorated with ( i assumed ) family photographs .
a lack of attention-to-detail let the overall ( otherwise old world ) room appearance down – most notably a modern cupboard and wardrobe , large wall-mounted television , a transparent plastic side table , and numerous notices covering the bureau ( see photos ) .
unfortunately the service let it down – staff were illusive , and turndown service was forgotten on both evenings .
although a few items in the guest room didn’t seem quite in keeping , the rooms are pleasant and the hotel’s public areas are beautiful and evoke a bygone era .
the bathroom was of a high standard , with extra large towels , luxurious bathrobes and ren toiletries .
* a few notable omissions from the guest rooms were : - tea/coffee making facilities – noting room service incurs a 15 euro surcharge to any order .
with a mere twelve rooms , this beautiful villa in the heart of rome is a unique property .
* the guest room was decorated with old world charm , including original art works .
