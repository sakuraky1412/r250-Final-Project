nette lage aber durchschnittlicher service !

excellent service ,  great location

phenominal service, great room, great location ,  couldn't have asked for more .

service was spotty  front desk was marginally helpful .

service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .

wonderful service friendly people

, provide service like high end hotels .

nice place but service could be better

split a fare w a private service i .

worst bw we've ever stayed in as far as service goes .

very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .

excellent service great location good value

the adjacent cafe pescatero was handy for breakfast but had some hiccups in service, but it was okay overall .

will store your luggage in separate room on your check out day if you have late flight, want to spend more time,oldest italian restaurant in the country w in walking distance, back east service, integrity, etc .

maid service was prompt, too .

the concierge service is excellent .

overall we had a nice stay but just had some minor service issues .

there is simply not the service, oriented feeling one is used to in this hotel group .

they state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .

housekeeping service was very inadequate, though .
