this hotel is so old and worn out , it should be torn down and rebuilt .
rooms decor is over 30 years old , bedspreads are disgusting and old , old style tv sets , very close to airport and can be quite loud .
checked in after 2pm , and was in a rush to get into atlanta for business purposes , he allowed me to use his computer to print some documents , and i advised him i would be coming back much later , and he agreed that i could use the compyer again .
but to my dismay at 730pm , i attempt to go into front lobby , whereby 2 chairs are blocking the door , i knock on the front door trying to get female clerks attention sitting in the back office working on the computer oblivious of anything going on around her .
i mouth to her i `` need to use the computer '' , refused to open the door .
i walk around to a window , and she starts immediately screaming at me , after i ask her `` where is a sign posted you close after dark '' , as she so said to me .
she continues to scream with her bugged out ugly eyes , and pointing her finger in my face , telling me `` you need to go back to your room . . .
and come back in the morning . . .
'' stay away from this dump ! ! !
old disgusting clearly evening clerk does n't care whatsover about the guest at this property , and if i could i would . . .
