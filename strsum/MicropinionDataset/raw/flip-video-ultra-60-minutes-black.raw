Pros:. Have only used it for a short time, easy to use, good in low light, able to take pictures of fireworks at night without auto light adjustment over compensating. Nice video camera for the price. Flip share software easy to use after a test run.. 
Cons:. suggest default names for videos loaded into pc or notebook instead of "untitled" could ease confusion and overwriting.. 
Summary:. I've taken pictures for over 40 years and have had numerous cameras and video cameras. This would not be my only camera, but one I wouldn't mind carrying with me all the time, for ease of use, portability and fun.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Video. Great Sound. Super Easy to use and install. Editing software is great. Battery life is good. Startup time for quick point and shoot is awesome!. 
Cons:. Unless you have rechargeable batteries I would recommend the Mino which has a rechargeable lithium battery installed.. You should buy the USB extender cable and use that in case the flip arm breaks ? it seems a little fragile.. 
Summary:. I could not be happier with product. I am amazed at the video and sound quality. It is easy to send videos by email and upload to your favorite websites. I upload to facebook and the quality is excellent. The other great feature is the start up time. 3 seconds and you are shooting film, which is great if you have kids or animals. I watched on my 17" LCD TV and the picture and sound were perfect. I have not watched on my 58" yet and I not expecting the picture to be good. This is perfect if you want to upload to websites to share your movies with friends and family. I would highly recommend you pay the extra few bucks and get this one. Don't buy it if you are expecting HD quality on a big screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is the SIMPLEST thing in the world to hand someone to record with. Very good quality to price ratio. AA batteries in Ultra GREAT for travelers. Underwater case is affordable and great protection from rain etc for using at games/outdoors.. 
Cons:. Yes, the software works, but you do have to know a little about getting around on the computer to use it. Rechargeable batteries in HD are a bad move. Needs a slot for memory for those traveling away from home (without computer).. 
Summary:. How can you not like this thing? It's so simple to use, you can hand it to any school aged child to film with. It takes slightly more knowledge to save the videos, but my 6th grader was able to do that after one 10 minute lesson. The bang for the buck is VERY high with this product. The video quality with the ULTRA is fine for most simple web applications. I can't wait to see the new HD model to see what it brings to the table! I only wish that they would go back to AA batteries or even 3V lithium batteries that I could replace (have a spare ready to go when traveling) and add a slot for memory for traveling. These two things would put this device in the near perfect catagory for a low end video recording device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set-up, use and download. 
Cons:. Didn't find any yet. 
Summary:. The whole concept of Flip Video is simplicity. Open the box, drop in the included (regular) batteries, shoot, review, download, done! The camera works great!! If you're looking to become the next Spielberg, or you want to film an 8-hour epic that you plan on boring your family and friends with, this camera is NOT for you. But if you want a fun and easy to use device that fits in your pocket, you'll love this. The video quality is very good and makes great videos in a normally lit room, with no need for one of those spotlights that blind the subject. Also simple is downloading. Flip out the USB connector, plug it into your computer and voila! The software begins to download on your computer and you're watching your videos in a matter of minutes. There is no software disk or manual needed. Cables are also included so you can watch them on your TV. Even the product registration is simple. All you do is send an email to the company with your particulars and it's done. No surveys and boxes to click and unclick. I rated this product a "10". I don't see any reason why I would need additional memory, but again, I don't plan on filming the next Hollywood blockbuster.. 

$$;
Pros:. small easy simple to use. relativley inexpensive. decent quality video. can use AA batteries. 
Cons:. optical zoom. Too much like a 'toy'. arm band could snap off. clickable buttons as opposed to touch screen.. 
Summary:. Overall simple pocket video camera good for people on the go or people with hobbies of vloging or short film productions.. My video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wa49Q7Q79Q. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, lightweight, very easy to use. Fast powerup. Better video and audio quality.than any comparable portable ram chip recorders. AVI format very compatible. Reasonable software, works easily with Windows XP SP2.. 
Cons:. Flip out usb port seems fragile. Buttons not all that sensitive, sometimes takes several button pushes to work. Batteries not removable. Bright record light on front discourages stealth recording. No lens cap or recess, concerns over scratching.. 
Summary:. This is a state of the art product. Better video and sound quality than all other mini portable ram chip recorders. Software is very simple but effecitve and the AVI format is so universal that it is editable by many other programs. Good capacity - 60 min. Works well with Windows XP Service Pack 2 but you will need a decently powerful computer to use their software for editing and downloading to YouTube, etc. Can be used without their software by dragging and dropping AVI files directly off the device to your hard disk. They should have included a USB extension cable, the flip out port seems fragile for the long haul. The buttons are kind of quirky and can take several pushes to work sometimes. The record light on the front discourages stealth recording and seems unneccessary. It comes with a small thin bag, but best to purchase the sturdier carrying case. I dont know if it will survive a drop otherwise. Plastic over lens is not recessed and may be subject to scratches. Having to recharge thru computer port can be inconvenient, but an expternal USB charger accessory is available.. Overall a remarkable product for the price and one that other manufacterers will seek to copy.. 

$$;
Pros:. portable, pocket-sized, user friendly - great quality!. 
Cons:. not great for macs. 
Summary:. we love this camera - the non-profit i work for - Christopher Coppola's (nephew of Francis Ford, brother of Nicolas Cage) PROJECT ACCESSIBLE HOLLYWOOD - has fallen in love with this product - we are now using them for our traveling new media film festivals - we empower the everyday person to tell their story - so these cameras are perfect - easy to use and can go anywhere! great for video bloggers!.

$$;
Pros:. SMALL CHEAP GOOD LOOKING QUALITY. 
Cons:. audio, small screen, no rewind on it. 
Summary:. I love this camera and although the new Mino came out recently I opted for this for a couple reasons. One it's cheaper. Two is that the underwatercase is only available for the the ultra and thats a large reason I got this in the first place is for when I go snorkeling in the Carribean. Three - it has a soft to touch finish not the shiny leave fingerprint one that the Mino offers. ALthough there are some downsides - I cant use the built in software to its full advantage with my mac and the audio isnt the greatest but for 150 bucks its well worth it and I am not worrying about taking thousands of dollars of eqipment into the water. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Good Quality, Super Easy to use.. 
Cons:. No memory Expansion or extra features on camera. 
Summary:. This camera is the easiest i've ever worked with. 3 members of my family have one (including myself) and I was delighted to not have to show them how to use it longer than 30 seconds of training. The quality is good, the optional underwater housing is a great feature. The camera interface only has a few buttons, hopefully they will add some special effects to the next model. I myself would love it to have tons of buttons and features if it didn't take away from the functionality of the camera. Remember you will need to get aquainted with a video editor like MS movie maker if you want to upload a movie to youtube that is longer than 3 min or so due to the native file size.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sturdy design &#38; easy to set up and use. The audio &#38; visual was excellent, the quality actually surprised me at 1st, as it was so good.. It came S.America with me in '09. Used in rainforests, beaches, jungles, cities, it paid for itself many times o. 
Cons:. 8gb is not near enough &#38; problem with getting a 2nd card tho is that a full battery charge will (barely) get you 8GBs of filming. Extra battery &#38; card wouldnt be worth the cost Software good for file transf &#38; mang, little else. V Basic features. 
Summary:. Considering the size, price and video quality, this camera is hard beaten. Im sure for the price there are cameras out there with as good and better quality and with more features but theres none that fit comfortably in your pocket and are tough &#38; flexible enough to use in almost any environment.. I also bought an adjustable tripod ('Gorilla tripod')and it was the perfect accessory at the time as I was going travelling. I had this camera with me everywhere and apart from actually in water, I had this with me at all times.. Used it as a 'helmet-cam' when we went ziplining, caving and even rafting. This really is where the Flip comes into its own, its ideal for spur of the moment filming and outdoors activity.. Unfortunately mine was since stolen but Ive no hesitation in buying a flip again (hopefully with more memory). 

$$;
Pros:. Low priced, no fuss, good quality for documentation and making memories.. 
Cons:. Flipshare needs to be improved to be user friendly. It opens another window and covers the main page. It keeps me from seeing what I need to do in the main page. 

$$;
Pros:. The size &#38; ease of use. they have upgraded the software since I first got my flip. It makes the process much easier.. 
Cons:. They did not inform me of the software upgrade &#38; I wasn't able to upload video to utube for months. Thank goodness I kept trying. I wish you could rotate the picture sometimes.. 
Summary:. It's great for what it is. A starter video camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely portable and easy to use. Easily replaceable battery-operated. Easy to download and get snapshots. Nice design.. 
Cons:. Could be easier to read keys in the middle. They are the same color as the background. Not excellent quality video, but then again, I didn't pay for excellent. I got a deal. More memory would be nice to have.. 
Summary:. This is a good value for the money paid. Of course, you can't expect top quality video if you paid such a low price. I had very little trouble downloading. Used the Flip software, even got good snapshots off the video. I like to save my videos elsewhere anyway. What if the camera gets lost of stolen? One should always back-up any video of value anyway. I wouldn't use it as a primary video for a wedding and expect professional quality, but it's a good general purpose, fun camera. It's one of those 'pass it around at the wedding' or 'use it at the kid's birthday party' types.. It's well on it's way in the next few versions if these improvements keep up. And, while I quite like Macs...anyone who owns one knows that given to Microsoft marketing over the 20 years, pc software tends to rule. Hopefully, FLIP will address the Mac in an upcoming version.. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use, cust. service &#38; support excellent!. 
Cons:. Audio lacking a bit-one tiny condenser mike. memory not expandable.. 
Summary:. Great for the price! ($149 Wal-Mart.com; shipped to local store for free.) The one I received had a defect w/software communication via USB. Emailed online support, and got a call within a day. Tech(who was fantastic!!!) determined it was product defect, and sent replacement via 2-day UPS, with RMA return label. new one works great. The tiny condenser microphone is good close range, without lots of extra background noise, but it would be nice if I could plug in a hand-held or shotgun mic. With no removable or expandable memory, if filming a 1 hour meeting, you may lose the end if the meeting runs long. I also bought Flip Video tripod and Action-Mount, very pleased with both of those. MU-VEE software lacks fade/ title functions, so I need to find alternative editing software, but I figured that I would.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light weight and convenient , film isn't bad for what it is -- a good value.. 
Cons:. It takes forever to compress for sharing. Editing software is limited.. 
Summary:. Okay, so it's not exactly the quality of my Panasonic, but for filming the grandkids carrying on or the puppy getting into trouble, it beats the heck out of getting out the camera bag and finding an unused minidv cassette so that by the time I'm ready to film the fun is over and the kids have moved on. My husband surprised me with this for Christmas and I had the camera up and running so fast I was able to get some great film of the family while they were still opening their gifts. Later I plugged it into my laptop to email the video to friends and family out of state and it took about ten minutes. Pretty cool.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, compact, easy to use, user friendly, convenient, generally good results.. 
Cons:. Combined USB/power connector needs to be on a flex mount. Entire weight of camera can bear down on it and it can snap off in a machine if you're not careful.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, good quality images, can capture still photo off video, durable - can carry it in a pocket like a cell phone.. 
Cons:. The software is set up so that you can only import videos from your camera, and if you store them on an external drive the flipshare program can't find them. Once you've moved them, you'll have to use another program to edit.. 
Summary:. good camera, but storage and editing problems persist even with the updated software. In this day and age when everyone stores on external drives, they ought to have an import feature that allows you to import from other drives. Even windows movie-maker is better in this regard.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video quality, small size, built-in software for sharing. 
Cons:. Record button is difficult to press. 
Summary:. I received the 1 GB version of this product (30 minutes of recording time) for Christmas, and it is great. Having small children means wishing you had the camcorder available at all times, and this product makes it possible. It is convenient to carry around and takes very good quality video as long as you don't plan to watch in full-screen mode. The file size is very large since there is very little compression of the video. So, emailing a video as an attachment is not really an option. Thankfully, the built-in software makes it easy to send someone an email with a link to view the video. Some users complain that deleting a video from the camcorder results in it also being deleted from their library on their computer, but I have not experienced that issue. All of my videos are saved on my computer using the one-click option in the software, and my camcorder is empty right now with the full capacity available. My only complaint is that the "Record" button is difficult to press and requires a couple attempts to start/stop recording, so it is possible to miss the first few seconds of your intended video. All in all, I am really pleasantly surprised by the capabilities of this small and inexpensive camcorder.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size - good video for the price. 
Cons:. not much range with zoom and sound quality could be improved. 
Summary:. For me, a complete novice in the digital video field, this device is great for me to practice with. The price was right, and I was able to learn a few tricks. I captured my bus ride to work, but the voices were drowned out by the diesel sound. A bargain for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is satisfactory. 
Cons:. Pushing the start button doesn't always start or stop the video. 
Summary:. The instructions say that once the Ready sign appears, you just need to push the red start/stop button to initiate the video. On my unit, this doesn't happen right away. I have to push the button over and over and then all of a sudden the video starts. By the time it starts the "spontaneous" video moment has gone.. 

$$;
Pros:. good price!. 
Cons:. little functionality. 
Summary:. When I first read about the ultra in this comparison: besthdcamcorderreview.com/flip-ultra-hd-vs-aiptek-action-hd-gvs-1080p-2/, I thought it was underrated and i think i am write, the price is great.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Size (It's very portable). - HD is cool. - Ergonomic. - Super easy to use. - MP4 video format is good. 
Cons:. - Slow to charge. - Sub par video quality. - Software is extremely limited. - It doesn't feel too sturdy. - No lens cover. - Zoom is no good. - It can't capture directly to a computer. 
Summary:. I've purchased several camcorders over the past years. I still think that the future of filming for the average user will be with a hand held flash memory product like this. Right now most of what I use are MiniDV camcorders and I think it would be unfair to compare them to this Flip camera since their video quality is definitely better.. In comparing this to my Canon PowerShot, I still would pick the PowerShot but they are comparable in many aspects.. Here are some highlights that I've come up with in regards to this camera:. - The battery charges via USB. That's good and bad. It's good because it's convenient. It's bad since it takes a long time to fully charge and you can't use your camera while it's charging.. - Transfer could be faster. If for some reason you're interested in filming an event that is a bit longer than the capacity on your camera it's not a quick process to transfer the video to your computer. I own the 120 min HD version and to transfer a full 120 min to my computer takes about 20 min. The transfer rate that I get is around 4MB/Sec. When I transfer using external HDs I usually get somewhere from 13MB/sec to 25MB/sec.. - It doesn't take pictures. I guess the people at Flip were trying to make this simple and straight forward, but I still think that the ability to take a quick picture is a good feature to have.. - The software that comes with the camera is pretty useless IMO. If you've used any video software you will not be interested in using this one.. - The picture while filming in the LCD looks better than what it does for real. When I was filming for the first times in low light, I was looking in the LCD and I was super impressed thinking that it was filming great because things still seems bright and defined. When I transfered the videos to my computer, I noticed that this wasn't the case and that the videos were actually pretty dark and very grainy.. - No instant capture. Again, I know this was intentional, but it really would be convenient if you could hook this up to your computer and have it be recognized as a video device. It would allow you to use other applications to record your video and it wouldn't have disk space or battery life limitations like it does.. - The mic is pretty good. It's very directional so it will really pick up well what's in front of it, and the sounds behind it will be much fainter. So if you are used to narrating while you are filming something, take that into consideration since your voice will be very faint since you're behind the mic.. - Does it really need a "Flip" usb device? I'd be happy with just a mini usb slot on it. The flip out usb stick is attractive but does take up a lot of space for a device which is trying to be as portable as possible. The flip out usb stick is short and if you are trying to plug it into your laptop for example, and you have something else plugged in, you're not going to have an easy time. I already have started taking around an extension usbchord with me to make sure I don't have problems with plugging it in harder to get to places.. - I bought a black Flip that had a rubbery type finish on it. Grease marks from your fingers will quickly appear all over your camera. I don't know really how to solve this one, but I don't feel like I have this problem with any of my other small electronics.. - FYI on the video size: 1.5 hours of very basic filming (I just left it filming the wall) took up about 3.2 GB. I'm not sure if the battery gave out or not, but it did just stop filming on it's own after 1.5 hours even though it still had enough space on it to film another full hour at least. (when filming motionless targets, you'll get more footage than advertised).. - There are NO VIDEO SETTINGS. The only settings you have are the date, if you want it to beep or not, and if you want the red light to come on when you are recording. I just assumed that I could film in something like 800X600 or something less than the full HD mode, but that's not an option.. - The Zoom was very weak. I'm guessing it's about a 2 times digital zoom. So you'll need to make sure that you're right up close to whatever you want to film with this camera.. - It only has HMDI out. If you like HDMI, than that's great, if you like other video formats, you'll need a converter and those aren't cheap.. - I wish it had a lens cover.. So those are my thoughts for now at least. In the end I wouldn't recommend this product and I'd probably suggest a real camcorder or even a digital camera like a Canon power shot that had HD if that's what you wanted.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, works well with Intel Macs and iMovie. 
Cons:. Image quality is disappointing.. 
Summary:. The quality of the video is no better then one shot on a cellphone, which is fine for the money, but don't expect your videos to look anything like the clips they show in the on-line ads or on the website. The focus is soft and the images are low contrast and low resolution.. 

$$;
Pros:. Truly amazing ease of recording and flexibility in the image sensor to adapt to light levels. Simple interface... my 9 yr old is a huge fan as well. I LOVE THE PRODUCT, and that is worth 5 stars.. BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; READ MY CONS. 
Cons:. SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT - Guess what Pure Digital, CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE PROBLEMS. Offer SOMETHING to allow us to use your product we love. Am still emailing w/ their support group &#38; 5 messages in, just getting... NO, Sorry for your inconvience.. 
Summary:. I LOVE AND MISS MY FLIP. I am trying to get it repaired, BUT FLIP support is BLOWING ME OFF. I am a huge fan, and been recommending these to everyone I know that travels. But regardless, still being blown off by their support. ?Loyal customers/advocates, pshhh don?t need em.? I am more than happy to share the chat logs with any interested, but the short is, I have cracked LCD screen in back and nearly 2/3 of it is black as a result. THEY DON'T CARE &#38; NO OPTIONS to get it repaired. RIDICULOUS!. Unfortunately, this poor experience with the support contact has take a product that I love and boast about and dropped it below some equipment that I had and hated.. It feels like when your favorite toy as a kid was broken by a neighbor or sibling(in my case with the FLIP, an airline) and then you ask your dad to fix it, and told NO. Not that it can't be done, just NO.. Unfortunately, the experience with FLIP support is turning me from a true fan of the product to the complete opposite side of the fence.. &gt;&gt;&gt;SIDE NOTE&lt;&lt;&lt; (I have chosen to include the email log so far.. Subject:::. Replacement screen for my FLIP. Discussion Thread:::. Customer (Dusty ######)	09/21/2009 04:34 PM. unfortunately my screen was cracked an aircraft storage overhead bin recently and has turned half the screen(right as facing the screen) black...

$$;
Pros:. Great size. Decent video. 
Cons:. The warranty, see below. 
Summary:. If your camcorder develops a problem within the 90 day warranty period:. My flip video developed lines on the screen (you could not see the video) after trouble shooting with technical they had me return it. A few weeks later I get it back with a letter saying it could not be repaired so it was replaced. The problem was that I sent a camera in that was in "Like New" condition without a scratch or a fingerprint on it and what I got back was a camera with many scratches including one on the screen itself. After numerous phone calls and promises that someone will get back to me no one has. I find it ironic that they will allow you to return your camera to them within 90 days of purchase for a full refund if you are not completely satisfied (you have to have purchased it from them directly)yet mine was defective and was returned within 90 days and I get a uses one back. I guess I now know what they are doing with returns from the unsatisfied customers. I have posted the warranty information below.. Please submit a request to customer support detailing the nature of the problem. We will attempt to resolve this issue for you and if not resolved, provide you with further direction to have your camcorder repaired or replaced with a refurbished unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use, great clarity, YOU CAN ERASE THE VIDEOS FROM THE FLIP TO USE IT AGAIN BUT HAVE TO ERASE THEM FROM THE DCIM FOLDER FIRST. ONCE THEY ARE GONE FROM THERE THEY ARE GONE FOR GOOD.. 
Cons:. Cant "make movies" longer than a couple minutes due to constant error messages that customer support is unable to help with. Customer support via email is absolutely useless. To make movie mixes you have to go into movie maker. 
Summary:. This camera is a great idea/ product from a company who lacks the customer support (unlike the old days) to make it truly great. My camera has worked but not to the ability the company says it can. They won't send me a new one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, portable, good for kids, good software. 
Cons:. Horrible close-ups, bad zoom, cheap video quality. 
Summary:. It's not a very good product, even though I'm a kid and I don't expect much, I should say that other camcorders like the Sony Bloggie. Don't buy it, I'm selling it on Ebay to get a Bloggie.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. Can't do anything with the video clips because iLife '09 does not recognize them.. 
Summary:. If you have an Apple computer do not purchase the Flip Video. 

$$;
Pros:. cheap and dirt-simple. 
Cons:. video is ok but most digital cameras have better quality and autoexposure, especially compensation for backlighting. BUT. THE WORST part is when you send an .avi file to a friend or relative and they tell you they can only hear the audio - NO VIDEO. 
Summary:. flip's requirement that you download software to view the video or have a flip connected is just nonsense. Buy a nice Canon camera, PowerShot SD1200 IS like I have, about the same price, takes HD stills, no-nonsense avi files, you'll be much happier.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good quality pictures, convenient size.. 
Cons:. When using a different flip camera, your previous files/movies will be overwritten; different serial number. Also, the "red" button does not work as it should, (I've used 3 FLIPS) and will not start and stop recordings without multiple touches.. 
Summary:. FLIP should include some instructions and information which will warn people about loosing all of their precious, unique footage when all files are overwritten automatically if the user plus in a second/different FLIP.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to take video and play back on the computer.. 
Cons:. Never able to send videos via email. Response from customer services was terrible!!!!!!!!. 
Summary:. The concept is good and I was really excited to receive my Flip as a gift from my parents that live across the country. They were also excited to be able to see video of their 1 yr old grandchild. Unfortunately, the device never worked correctly and I was only able to send 2 videos before it broke. I spent an endless amount of time corresponding with the Flip customer service both via email and over the phone. I was asked the same questions over and over again and told on numberous occassions that the problem would need to elevated to their Teir 2 customer service. After 3 months of trying everything they suggested they finally agreed that I should send the Flip back to them and they would replace it. I shipped it back to them (on my dime) and received the same device back in the mail about 2 weeks later. The outcome, it still had the same exact problem it did before it was shipped. I left a not so nice vm with their corporate office but never received a call back from them.. I don't suggest purchasing one of these!. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to operate and relatively inexpensive. 
Cons:. 1. Low resolution video; 2. No removable memory. After 60 minutes you either must download or delete. 3. Lousy software with major bugs.. 4. Support is worse than a joke. Endless delay by requests for more information - never any useful response. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to operate -- even my 4 year old niece can film videos, play them back, and delete those she doesn't want; cheap; small.. 
Cons:. Software bugs are devastating....check the blogs on this one. the only way to save videos is to go to a pure digital service provider. 
Summary:. 3 problems, 2 big ones:. 1) If you only want to have 60 minutes of video forever, this is for you. However, if you want to download videos and save them, you can't save more than 60 minutes worth. You can "save" them to your desktop, but your camcorder will still show as full. You can delete the files you've saved in the library or delete them in the camcorder, but then they are permanently gone. Really. The intended use is taking vidoes, posting them, then deleting them....hmmmmm. Customer Service is also pretty lame...of course you can't speak with anyone, you only get an email response that is unclear.. 2) Software bugs....Now my videos automatically close after 1 second of play time...quick time says it's encountered a problem...this is even with the firmware update. Please don't frustrate yourself and buy this...it's deceptive...it sounds like a great product -- I was one of the first to buy one -- and you will love the videos you shoot, but you may never be able to access them or to shoot more than 60 minutes worth. I don't know about you...but I don't like some souless corporation messing with my videos.... 3) Customer support is lame...but what do you expect?.

Pros:. Compact, good battery life, ultra-easy to operate, nice frame resolution. 
Cons:. 1) Does not have image stabilization - tough to get smooth video. 2) appears processor is not capable to keep-up with streaming HD frame rates, resulting in sound/video FRAME loss. 3) Exporting to WMV or AVI CODEX not supported after ver 4.5.. 
Summary:. 1) Does not have image stabilization and is extremely tough to get smooth video. 2) Although frame resolution is nice, the camera appears not capable to keep-up with streaming frame rates necessary for HD, therefore sound and video frames are clearly LOST, resulting in very brief lapses which is a BIG problem to me. 3) I'm really unhappy that their software version 4.5 supported (at minimum) export to WMV but version 5 doesn't output anything except their proprietary MP4 format. Why not output it in something that major consumer/pro editor suites can utilize (import) like AVI? Technical Services Department at Flip-video were not very helpful either. This looks like a flash-in-the-pan. Sorry....

Pros:. There are no pros. 
Cons:. Firmware update erases all video.. 
Summary:. Posters who criticize "non-tech" users completely miss the point. I wouldn't be surprised if they were Pure Digital shills. Especially in that they seem to have knowledge way beyond what is included in the software package or attainable on the LAME support site. The whole point and advertising representation of this product is that it is SUPPOSED TO BE EASY, which it is clearly not if you must be tech savy. Thank you Flip, for erasing my daughters birthday videos with your forced firmware update which said all video would be safe. halley'scomet is dead on. This product is terrible and certainly not what it represents itself to be. 2 THUMBS DOWN..

Pros:. Easy to use, well designed. 
Cons:. Product not built to last, unmotivated customer service. 
Summary:. I purchased the Flip Video and was instantly amazed by the simplicy and intuitive engineering of the device. I was an extremely happy customer until I needed support. Every once in a while I would turn on the camera and instead of getting a video image, I got a black screen. Restarting the unit usually took care of the issue.. Now after a year, I only get this black screen and nothing else, the camera will no longer function. I contacted Pure Digital Technologies for assistance and we began the troubleshooting process. I was told to take out the batteries for 2 days and put in fresh ones and try again. This did not work. Pure Digitals response? They informed me I was past my 90 day warranty and sorry for the inconvenience. Case closed and marked solved. They have chosen not to respond to any further requests for help.. A quick search on the net showed me that I am not alone with this problem... This appears to be occuring rather often with their product and they are unwilling to stand behind their quality if your purchase happened more than 90 days ago. This is by far the weakest link in Pure Didgital technologies flip video chain. My advice... Spend the extra $ and get another manufacturer's product that is built to last. As cool as this video camera was, consumer electronics should not be a crap shoot..

Pros:. Video is great. 
Cons:. Now you can not use basic MOV or WMV conversion and it took me two weeks to get this info from the Flip Video team. Now I have to buy a video conversion product to use my Mobile Me or MAC Quicktime. And they call it an easy alternative. See below:.

Response (Flip Video Support)	01/02/2010 06:10 PM. Thank you for contacting us.. The FAQ you erad on our site is addressing an older version of the FlipShare application (versions 4.1 and 4.5). The most recent version of FlipShare (5.0.5) does not include a file converter, you are welcome to try third-party applications to convert the file from AVI or MP4.. A Google search recovered the following which you may wish to try:. http://pack.google.com/intl/en/pack_installer.html?brand=GPMA&#38;utm_campaign=en&#38;utm_source=en-ha-na-us-google&#38;utm_medium=ha&#38;utm_term=software. http://www.nchsoftware.com/software/converters.html?gclid=CJLT_7b0v54CFSReagodFXnCpw. http://pervasivedatatools.com/solutions/databases?src=google&#38;grp=oracle&#38;gclid=CJixsb30v54CFSWjagodtHthog.

I am confused by your answer to this query ?Although the most recent version of FlipShare does not include a file converter, you are welcome to try third-party applications to convert the file from AVI or MP4?. According to your online web page Flip software does convert to .MOV on the Mac (See below) just not how it is accomplished. That is my question.. Question. If I want to convert my videos into a video format other than H.264/MP4, how do I do that?. Answer. The videos recorded with your Flip UltraHD camcorder are captured using H.264 video compression and AAC audio compression, saved as an MP4 file. Using the FlipShare program that runs from your camcorder, you can convert your videos into a more compact size and format for emailing or uploading (WMV on Windows and MOV on Macintosh). Once your videos are converted, they are saved in folders on your Desktop. For more information on using these features, review the section on Saving Videos.. Regards,. Tom Smith.

Pros:. Portability.. 
Cons:. Poor video quality. Lousy software. DVD files are .wmv, so not playable on DVD players.. 
Summary:. This cam does not replace a standard digital recorder. This product is basically a child's toy. Save your money and buy a real "handycam".. Updated. on May 18, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Seems like a good value. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. Annoying background noise. 
Summary:. I purchased this for my teenaged daughter. She loved it for its ease of use and uploading to You Tub. But! - and this is a BIG BUT - replaying videos always resulted in a humming, buzzing, and or mechanical type noise in the background. Regardless of where the recording took place.. A visit to the Amazon forum on this device was crowded with similar experiences.. I have no choice but to return it. A great disappointment given all of the positive reviews I read before purchasing it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great toy for kids. 
Cons:. Good luck when the USB connector snaps off. 
Summary:. Most decent digital photo cameras already come with this same video feature incorporated into the camera. The resolution it very low compared to true digital and all you need to do is add $50 and you have any number of digital camera on the market to choose from.True it is easy to use but it appears marketed to the mentally challenged who have to use velcro on their shoes and still think the 3 Stooges are funny. Spend the extra few dollars and get a decent name brand camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. great price, great design, works good with a dvd recorder. 
Cons:. A family member and myself purchased 2 of the cameras, we are having to return both of them. both cameras would not update the firmware and 1 camera could not be recognized by windows.. 
Summary:. This was a great idea for a camera however, I think it needs some work. I feel Pure Digital needed to do some more beta testing before this camera hit the shelves. I do think Pure Digital is heading in the right direction.. 

$$;
Pros:. No information. 
Cons:. We purchased the design your own flip and have never been able to use it. The USB connection doesn't fit into our PC and Mac computers. Apparently, this is an issue that affects a massive number of flip camcorders.. 
Summary:. Don't buy until they figure out their sign problems. Customer service is friendly but they don't know how to process returns. Let them work out their problems before buying.. 

$$;
Pros:. UNTIL THEY GET IT RIGHT NONE. 
Cons:. READ PREVIOUS REVIEWS AND WISE UP. 
Summary:. I WAS ALMOST ON THE POINT OF BUYING ONE OF THESE,WARRENTY AND SUPPORT IS POOR OR LIMITED TOO MANY ARE GOING FAULTY SO ITS DESIGN FAULT OR QUALITY CONTROL YOU SHOULD ALL QUALIFY FOR A FREE EXCHANGE OR REFUND.

Pros:. the thing was priced right. 
Cons:. I got to use mine twice. before it stopped functioning. 
Summary:. Customer service:. Customer 07/07/2009 0527 PM. Flip Staff,. I have tried to go through customer service tech help, but the site always. seems to be down (go figure). My Flip camcorder looks like new, because I have been able to use it only. twice. I received it through Dell with the purchase of a PC.. The model is "Flip Video".. It has ceased to move past the initial start up screen, I called your tech. line and stayed on terminal ignore forever, then left. a message, which was real tricky to do (it doesn?t work well either). I have now waited over a week and a half for a call back, nothing.. I have tried new batteries, leaving them out for 72 hours,. even did all the other hokey - pokey type crap talked about all over the. Internet to no avail.. I have come to the conclusion after reading everything I can about this. thing that it is junk.. The fact that you supply not nearly enough tech help exasperates the. problem.. I have contacted Dell and told them they need to check their vendors out. better and left a complaint with them about you're complete lack of customer. support.. Response (Flip Video Support) 07/07/2009 07:50 PM. Hi Xxxxx,. Thank you for contacting us.. We apologize for any confusion on our part.. Can you please tell us when you purchased your PC and camcorder? Also, have you had any results when leaving the batteries out for 72 hours?. Thank You,. Flip Video Support. Customer 07/07/2009 11:32 PM. Yeah, after the 72 hour rest the camera needed to work it loaded up fine, but as soon as I turned it off, it wouldn't reload again.. I didn't buy the camera to sit on the shelf with the batteries out.. 12/01/2008 so I guess I should feel lucky it lasted this long?. Response (Flip Video Support) 07/10/2009 12:05 AM. Dear Xxxxx,. Thank you for your continued patience as we work to resolve your issue.. Pure Digital warrants Flip Video camcorders for a period of 90 days from the date of purchase.. As you are beyond the warranty period and our troubleshooting efforts have not allowed us to regain power on your camcorder, we are unable to further offer or suggest any means by which we can repair the camcorder or retrieve the videos; and our warranty policy does not allow for replacement of the camcorder after the 90 day warranty period.. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.. Thank you,. Flip Video Support. Customer 07/10/2009 12:30 PM. As I said, It is Junk. 90 days pfft.. I have a Sony camcorder that is 10 years old, no problems.. I will be sure to pass on all over the internet just what a low quality piece of crap you sell, so others will not repeat my mistake in trying you're products.. Updated. on Jul 12, 2009.

Pros:. ease of use for a while..(!) convienent .. 
Cons:. Sticky buttons (press hard) camera decided to stop workin 1 day and that was it. Flip tech supp wasn't any help. Aperently I'm not the only victim of this electronic marvel. a comon prob? grainy pic on t.v pixel size best if used on a uter scren.. 
Summary:. Good concept...I 'll try someone elses version to see if they got it right or at least better.... 

$$;
Pros:. It was very easy for my 12 year old to use when it worked!! It worked great for one whole day!! It's alot of money to pay for something you can only use just once!. 
Cons:. Bad customer service, if you have one that is defected, you have to ship it to the company and wait 4 to 5 weeks. 
Summary:. It was great the first day she used it, however on the second day, it completely shut down. We thought it was the batteries, we went out and bought new rechargeable batteries and that wasn't the cause. We just happened to buy one that is a defect!! It's nice to know that we weren't the only ones who bought one that is defective. My daughter had saved up all of her allowance and went with the Flip b/c of the Media and advertisements. She wishes she went with a lesser known and cheaper camera. We have never been so dissatisfied with a product and for the campany to not back up their product is unnacceptable!. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works it's good.. 
Cons:. There is a known defect with the product in which it just stops working - see forums on the web. The company kept blowing me off - saying they would call me back when I called support but they never did.. 
Summary:. If you get a defective one, you're screwed. This company believes that saving the money on one unit isn't worth the bad pr of just ignoring problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. cheapest I ever saw in camcordeers.. 
Cons:. not even good as a door stop. 
Summary:. couldn't even get to see the video at all.
