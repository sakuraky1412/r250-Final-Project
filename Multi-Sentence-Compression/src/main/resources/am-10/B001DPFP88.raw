This is one of the cheaper parts so I could see getting this one (and maybe the lid switch or motor couplings).
great price I keep one in stock.
If you're having problems with your motor/clutch/timer or other electrical part, you might want to think about getting another top loader like an Amana before they stop carrying them in stores in about a year or so.
Just what I needed.
Worked great thank you.
Consider the wisdom of spending a lot of money on replacement parts for a 10+ year old washer that you originally bought for $400.
Great product.
as advertised.
Great.
Good  Job.
