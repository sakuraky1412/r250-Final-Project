this is a very convenient location for the ferry ( to be honest , nowhere in calais is very far from it ) , but in quite a dodgy area and given that there are no other eateries or bars in the vicinity ( and it would be a 25+ minute walk to any ) you are left with little choice other than to drive if there is nothing you fancy on the limited menu or if you do n't fancy paying a rather steep 9 euros for breakfast which was ok but not worth that price .

it was very hot , and there was some noise from sirens and traffic during the night , but too warm to close the window .

free wifi is good , beds were very comfortable and it was very clean .

all in all it was ok for a night , but i probably would n't stay here again , would try the campanile or a different location.
also there are no kettles in the room ( some are apparently available to borrow , but none left when we arrived at 7pm ) .

parking is plentiful and free , but does n't feel that secure , the security fence is high but not closed .
