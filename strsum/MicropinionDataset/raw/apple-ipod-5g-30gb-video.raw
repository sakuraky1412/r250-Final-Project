$$;
Pros:. Beautiful Screen, Great sound quality, excelent video quality, and syncs with the best music player of all time. 
Cons:. Can't think of any!. 
Summary:. Apple has once again put out a great music player. I owned a 20gb ipod before this, and I can say after using both the video capability is an excellent extra. Sound and video quality on the player are excellent. The screen quality is incredible for such a small device. It is much thiner that my previous ipod, and it has 10 more gigabytes. The battery life on the video could be slightly better, but the music battery life is great. The music quality is very good, and I love that the player shows the album art when you are playing a song. There is also new ipod games for download. The itunes software works seamlessly with ipod, and it is very easy to sync music and movies. I was a little disappointed to see that itunes doesn't offer a video conversion software, but there is multiple free softwares out there for converting videos to the h.264 format.. Other than a few problem with itunes, this music player has very few flaws and I would recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video, Music, Games, Books, post its, updates, phone book, only thing it doesn't do is make phone calls. 
Cons:. only one is that the headphones and screen aren't too sturdy. 
Summary:. Ya know, the ability to put more songs than you could listen to in a year isn't all that bad. It is a lot of memory, and you can fill it up with just about anything. The only way it could be better is if it was a cell phoen too, hint hint apple. 

$$;
Pros:. wicked sound quality and so sexy. 
Cons:. nothing bad about it. 
Summary:. i dont know who is in charge of making the decisions at cnet but come on the gigabeat(or whatever its called)better than the ipod.never in amillion years.a friend recently bought the gigabet and i tried it out for a few hours.thats all it took for me to understand that the ipod is the true GOD.as for toshiba,sony and the rest keep on trying maybe one day(ha ha ha). 

$$;
Pros:. Very nice video quality; endless amount of space for good quality audio; I can take my entire audio collection everywhere I go!. 
Cons:. No accessories accompany the iPod except earbuds and a cheap carrying case.. 
Summary:. This is the second MP3 player I've owned and it was well worth the money (first MP3 player was an iAudio U2, which is excellent for using while exercising).. I bought the 30gig 5G iPod about a week before I went on vacation. I was tired of carrying around a boatload of CDs and wanted something that could hold my entire CD collection AND be easy to FIND albums and songs without having to do a lot of shuttling. Once I converted everything to the iTunes format, it quickly synced my iPod and kept the tunes organized. With just a couple clicks on the iPod, I could see all my albums. One more click into my album of choice and there were my songs ready to be played. Truly excellent!. I searched the internet for an DVD converter for the iPod. I tried Handbrake but couldn't get it to work for my Windows formatted computer so I bought a converter which worked with no problem. I converted a movie and some series episodes. They worked fine on the iPod. Very good quality. I was going to buy a DVD player for my vacation, but bought another iPod instead and just converted some movies for the trip. I had a 15 hour flight to contend with.. The iPod battery seemed to be very good. The iPod I used just for music lasted the entire flight and more. The iPod using the video was good for a few hours into the flight, then I had to use the extra battery. I bought an iLuv battery and case that the iPod fits in. The iLuv/iPod combination lasted for days before needing to be recharged.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not Available. 
Cons:. Not Available. 
Summary:. Are you looking for an MP3? This iPod is what you are looking for.. I bought it for Christmas and it's wonderful, no problems at all with it, I have the Logitech mm50 speakers and I use it at home to listen to my music, when they say it's kind of scratch attractive, they are not lying, I bought a transparent plastic protector, and it's well protected. Don't get obsessed with it, enjoy it! You bought it to use it. I know it's cute but don't worry to touch it, you're not going to break it.. Hope it has been useful!. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything else. Great LCD, good storage space. 
Cons:. Apple software but you can use your own. 
Summary:. The video IPod is a portable entertainment powerhouse! if you want get a real Ipod and a real deal to match, then you can sign up yourself and a 5 buddies and you can get a freebie. No kidding! I did it, my neighbor did it, and I see no reason you can't. I use to always ignore the free ipod offers until my neighbor told me he got his free through their service. You see the way it works is they count on the fact that most people aren't going to have the little bit of "sticktuitivness" that it will take to sign up 5 people. It really isn't hard however if you just put a little effort. You can get your free video or nano ipod at http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=16498848. Click or cut and paste the linko and you'll be on your way to a real fresh freebie. And remember to stick to it. Let me reiterate go for the video pod the thing is awesome. You can watch movies and they look great. I use a nifty little piece of software for converting dvds and watch stuff in class, on planes, and in waiting rooms. Really sweet!. 

$$;
Pros:. Design, Easy to use navigate, Video, 30GB!!.

Pros:. 7500 songs, videos, photos.. 
Cons:. low battery life for videos, scratches easily, video must be specific format.. 
Summary:. the best mp3 player yet, every time i buy an electronic i find my self hardly using it after a while, not this. with incredibly large storage you can fit more then enough songs. i'm pretty sure that i wont get tired of this within the next 3 years. i cant wait to see next years ipod's. must get item..

Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Bad Battery Life for Video. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound quality, great price, large space. 
Cons:. low batter life on video. 
Summary:. I think this is by far the BEST mp3 player. I have owned a Jukebox, a creative player, and a Samsung Yepp, an Ipod 3, 4 Gen, and also a Mini Ipod before. All cannot measure up to the new 5G Video Ipod! The screen is amazingly bright and easy to read. The features are nice. I know, other mp3 players usually have line-in, FM, voice recorder and all those crap, I owned the Creative and Yepp before and both have all the other functions, but the Samsung Yepp are really hard to netvigate.. I got that mp3 player for my mom and the fonts are so small and it's so hard to use that we finally give up on it. Basically now we only use it as a recording pen. and the creative just feel cheap in hand, though is user friendly and the price is decent. but the Ipod is superb! The sound quality, the easy netvigation of the manul, is just SO NICE! Everything is so easy to use, so self-explanatory, no hassle! And now with the bright screen, is perfect for anyone! Also, now, i can read some notes on there and sync my i-cal onto it and see it in color! and my pictures can be stored there and also viewed on the nice color screen. Some users have problem with transfering the videos onto the ipod. but since i use a powerbook. I found it very easy... even easier then the PSP. I use handbrake, and just one click, a dvd can be convert to Ipod format. However, i do not find the video function too useful and it drains the battery too quickly. But oh well, I get an mp3 player, not a big PMP that epson sells. So i just take that as an extra features of a very very nice Mp3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. It works and I know because i already recieved one. 
Cons:. absolutely none, why not try it out. 
Summary:. Copy and paste this url into your browser and all you have to do is complete one offer. They you recieve your ipod free. No Shipping cost or any other costs.. http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=25775530. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays video, great sound quality, pictures are crisp right down to the last detail, battery life is great. 
Cons:. ummm...can. get. scratched easily?. 
Summary:. If you are looking to buy an mp3 player. keep this ipod on your mind. Sound quality is great. Sounds just like any cd. The new feature in this ipod is of course, video. at first i was mad because i had a bunch of videos i wanted to put in my ipod, but i found a program called videora ipod. That program will convert any old video file that you have on your computer and convert it to an ipod friendly format. So now i can watch anything i want and not be limited to buying videos from itunes. ANother feature the ipod has is photo-nothing new. You can look at any photo that you have on your computer and import it to your ipod. Those pictures look perfect.. i cannot think of any con that would stop you from buying an ipod except for the price..

$$;
Pros:. Video and color screen at no extra cost.

$$;
Pros:. Video, Great battery life, Incredible display. 
Cons:. Video battery life not so hot. 
Summary:. THis is awesome, I love it. THe display is amazingly crisp and detailed. I love the battery life for audio playback, even though the during video it drains the battery pretty quick. I love being able to take clips from home videos to show them to other people. It is very slim and light. AWESOME is all I can say. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Nothing at all. 
Summary:. I used to hate apple products, after getting this player, I love them. That says it all. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything is outstanding. 
Cons:. Doesn't play most non ITunes music Videos. I need to convert them. 
Summary:. Been fooling with it tonight and love it. Was shipped Wednesday and was suppose to be delivered Friday but got it today Thursday. Ordered from Apple Store. 

$$;
Pros:. Video Support, Larger LCD, 41% Thinner. 
Cons:. Video playback is only 2hours, due to the thicknest of the unit.. 
Summary:. Over all, I just got it in yesterday on Oct 19th, 2005, shipped in from China. None of the stores have this unit yet. I have added videos, photos and music. Over all my experience so far has proved well worth the cost of the unit. It's thin, lightweight, and easy to use. The video is as sharp as can be, and you can process your own videos as long as you have Quicktime Pro 7.0.3. Which is free to download on Apple's website, or you can opt to buy the professional version which in turn lets you do more with the video. The battery life on the 30gb model is great for the music side. 14hours of music can be played, but if your going to use video, you might want to bring a charger with you, when you play video it only lasts about 2 hours. This is due because of the size of the battery and how thin the unit is. If you opt for the 60 GB model, your battery life increases. Music can go for 20 hours, and video is 3hours. But you can use 3rd party extended external life batteries, if you want to watch more video. Most older accessories will work, even the photo dock, and older docks you might have. The only issue you will have is, that you'll have a space in front and in the back of the unit, where it is docked. I have tested this with a photo dock and it works just fine. I would highly recommend this unit. Even though video has been out forever on MP3 players and same with photo abilites, it's just nice to have video finally on an iPod. Plus, Apple has 75 percent of the market sales for MP3 players, if they weren't doing something right, that number wouldn't be like that. The next major company that has a chunk of the market is Creative Labs, and they only have about 3-4 percent of the market area. If numbers don't speak for themselves, I don't know what will.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best toy of the year. 
Cons:. Not soo good battery life... 
Summary:. this should be this years best mp3 player hit with the thin apple design this is for sure the best product that will fly of the store shelfs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Thinner, more storage, enhanced features, bigger screen, lighter.... 
Cons:. Umm - battery length isn't great. 
Summary:. First - to address the haters. This is not the Archos - it's thinner, wieghs less than half as much, can be used in one hand, has the simplicity of the scroll wheel and, well, it's pretty! On top of all of those comparative pluses it's cheaper and it has more storage - hello upgrade! To the whiners about paying for video - you don't have to buy it but if you're downloading the video and putting it on your player for free you might want to realize that's actually illegal!!!! Ok - so on to the pluses compared to the past iPod. Screen is bigger and more vivid. The storage capacity increased, the size got thinner, increased functionality with the new little apps. Overall it's a great update/upgrade and the only issue might be battery length but it's still good - keep an adapter at work if you're going to listen to it all day.... 

$$;
Pros:. Small, lightweit, fits anywhere, easy to use, big color screen, clickwheel and packed with features.. 
Cons:. Bad service from iTunes Music/Video Store. 
Summary:. This is a great product, it can fit anywhere easily and has lots of space for music and videos. It has a big color screen for its' size. Yes, there are other products out there like the Archos AV 480 with a bigger screen etc... But will they fit in your pocket? I don't think so. Also, they are about three times more expensive than this iPod! That's why I think this gets the job done better than any other portable "media center" for a much cheaper price.. The bad thing about it though is that music videos cost 2$. Who would buy a music video for 2$?? The price for the shows are reasonable though (also 2$), but its still money going out of you pocket. I get them free.. What I did was this: Using a T.V. Tuner I record every show I know I am going to miss, and keep it on my iPod.. Overall, I think the product itself is perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great High rseolution display, Good Sound Quailiy, Comfertable to hold, Pleanty of storage space, sleek, great games and movie selections, tons of features like contacts calender and stopwatch, and a video output, you can order and replace a battery. 
Cons:. 2 Hours and 30 minutes approx. video play time. easily scratches (unless you buy a case). 
Summary:. Overall this is a great product. it has so many great features. I was impressed by the high resolution desplay and the fast load time. the click wheel has no delay. i personally love that i can have all my music on this device and still have room to install games and a couple movies. there are over 20 games to chose from and all of them are easy to control that you can purchase on itunes. So the Bottom line is, its easy to control, its seek, easy and fun to hold, strong and sturdy and has a great audio and video quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice screen, classic apple, large amount of storage space, great color on videos. 
Cons:. short battery life. 
Summary:. Out of all the iPods and MP3 players that i own, this is my all time favorite. It has a traditional Apple design, a great screen resolution, &#38; huge amounts of storage. I like to watch my favorite Television episodes, but after I watch two the battery is already drained. Also when I watch full length movies, the battery is drained at the end of the movie, and i pretty much have to stop using the iPod or else it would turn off. My opinion is to get the iPod, but also get some portable/car chargers because you'll need them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice screen and awesome interface. 
Cons:. Headphones are crap. 
Summary:. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. nothing so far. 
Summary:. I just got the 30GB IPod video yesterday and so far all I can say is that is awsome. I haven't uploaded any video files yet so I couln't tell you how that works but that's not the reason why I bought it I bought it for the music. It sounds great and looks great as well. As a first time IPod owner I would recommend this product to any one looking for an MP3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. very thin, seamless with itunes, lots of shows to buy.. 
Cons:. only plays mp3's and acc's.no fm radio.doesnt come with itunes disk.. 
Summary:. well I was always an apple hater, but I decided. to get a ipod as a backup to my zen vision m. I really like that you can put lyrics on the ipod.and look at a larger image of the artwork.. I hate the fact that every on buys these,but now that i own one I can see why.. I would suggest it if you have alot of mp3's.. its not like it matters though cause people will buy them, cause there cool to have or whatever.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good screen, super easy menu, iTunes is very intuitive!. 
Cons:. Back of the player is easy scratched, when full the menus do get laggy. 
Summary:. I have had my iPod 30gb now for nearly a year and I could not recommend it anymore! The player itself is very solid and has a lovely feel to it when you hold it in your hand. The iTunes software included will quickly become your no.1 music playing software because it is so intuitive to use and music, video and photos transfer to your iPod with no problem. Once turned on the menu system is so easy a 3 year old could use it. Anyone who is nervous about using technology should have no fears after using an iPod for more than about a minute! Videos, music and photos play beautifully on the large screen. One think to look out for is the lag if buttons are pushed too quickly. Apart from this using the player is a dream! My only criticisms of this player are:. -Shiny back gets marked if you look at it. -Menu lag when iPod becomes rather full. -Lack of "stuff" included in the price, it really should come with a better case or something!. Overall this is a fantastic player with excellent features and beats any player in the price field.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. Nothing is bad about it.. 
Cons:. Nothing. Everything is good!!!. 
Summary:. I am VERY HAPPY with my 5G iPod Video. I have been babying it for a LONG TIME!!!! This iPod outbeats all the other MP3 players out there!!! No doubt!!! It is a solid device by Apple Inc. I just love it and will love it forever!!! The resolution on the color screen is Phenomenal!!! The battery life is NICE! EVERYTHING IS NICE!!! Another awesome Apple product!!! I will be very happy with Apple for a long time. In fact, I bought a 4G 20gig iPod and a 3G 10gig iPod to add to my collection. With that, I own a Powerbook G4 which is AMAZING!!!!!! ONCE YOU GO MAC, U'LL NEVER GO BACK!!!! I will buy anything Apple now!!!. -Sachin. Portage, MI. 

$$;
Pros:. slim, portable, colour display, large storage. 
Cons:. display kills the battery. 
Summary:. I love this model, great price for amount of storage, I was very impressed with the quality of the videos once put on the ipod super clear, One precaution the backs of these ipods scratch very easily so does the screen, purchasing a cover is worth the investment. 

$$;
Pros:. click wheel, video capability, huge memory, stopwatch... list goes on and on.... 
Cons:. still scratches. no fm radio or voice recording. not really 30GB its 27.8GB. 
Summary:. I bought the 5G a year ago for $300 (which is now $250) and now a year goes by and it still works as if i just got it on day 1. I loved the fact that im free from CD's and can finally drag my collection in a size that can fit my pocket. You can also add them in playlists so you can add a playlist as (new hits) or (the good stuff). and you can also sort them by artist, album, title of song (all in a-z). you can also watch movies on it which is a great plus when you get tired of listening to your music. the negatives that i have with the ipod is that it still has no fm radio or voice recording or fm recording. it still scratches like if youre holding a CD. I put my ipod in protective overlays and a case to keep it having that fresh and brand new look. If only apple can fix these problems they would probably have SOLD OUT signs everywhere all the time like they did last year when the nano and video came out. But i still love my ipod and im still gonna keep mine forever and ever (until it breaks because nothing in the world we make can last forever). Updated. on Aug 20, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. loads music quick nice screen size for videos. 
Cons:. creats to many screen scratches. 

$$;
Pros:. Wonderful screen, good sound quality. 
Cons:. Battery life a little short, scratches. 
Summary:. The first thing I noticed when I pulled it out of the box was that it already had some little scratches. It didn't really bother me but I found it odd.. The screen is very bright and the sound quality sounds fine to my ear.. The battery life is a little bit short but with the firmware update that came out in September 06' (you can now ajust the brightness) it seems better when the brightness is lower.. I love this and it is a really nice player. Highly reccomended. Zbetta. 

$$;
Pros:. thin and pretty light. 
Cons:. video is hard to see in the sun and is expensive!!. 
Summary:. the video ipod is on of the best PVP in the market, and with it's compadability with the itunes music store it is even better.. 

$$;
Pros:. good sound quality,good video quality,good pic slide show,lots of memory. 
Cons:. easily scratches,gets lots of smudges,gets dents,bad battery life,no extra acessories. 
Summary:. This is a really good ipod.It has all the functions you need it to have this is a good quality ipod.Its video function is real awsome.but it takes up a lot of your battery.If you play with it too much the battery will die.It has good programs in there like a stop watch,world clock,calender,games and more.In itunes theres a lot of videos,music,music videos and podcast to choose from.I really recommend getting this ipod.Probably sold ot still by now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredible sound quality, extremely easy to use, build quality is better than any other portable media device I have used, great accessory line up, podcasts/videos are easy to manage. 
Cons:. Reliance on iTunes (which is a great program, but restricting), not the best screen or feature set on the market. 
Summary:. I have owned and used many MP3 players and have been blown away with the sound and build quality of the iPod.. I have never really liked the Apple company or products, but decided to finally give the iPod a try after owning many subpar players, including the new Gigabeat S.. I am extremely happy with my 30gb iPod and now see why they have such a large share of the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, iTunes intergration and sound quality.. 
Cons:. Just a little better battery life.. 
Summary:. The 5th generation (5G) iPod is a great device. It doesn't seem to be getting much praise here on CNET because people people seem to think this is a portable video player.. Lets get some things straight.... The 5G iPod (30 and 60GB models) are portable MUSIC players that have the capability of playing limited video. If you use your iPod to listen to music then you will not be disapointed. If you think you can go and download a bunch of video files and use your iPod to watch hours of video then you won't be happy.. The 5G iPod can play video really well and for a small screen, it looks really good. I think Apple ment for the video capabilities to be used for watching a short video clip or two while you're passing time at the airport or on your otherwise boring commute to work riding a bus or train. That's how I use my iPod and I have had no complaints.. The iPod is a great device if you are using it with any computer. It's 100 times better if you're using it with a Mac. It's so easy to put all of your contacts from your address book and all of the things in your iCal calendar onto your iPod. It's really cool when you're wondering what appointment you have tomorrow or something like that and you're on your way to or from the office and you don't want to (or can't) pull your laptop out. It's all on your iPod.. For another issue concerning the whole iPod line is lack of a AM/FM tuner built in. I think that might be a cool addition to an iPod but I'm ok without it. The music that I've put on my iPod is what I want to hear and I have control over it. I can live without the radio for now.. I hear a lot of complaints about the iTunes Music Store on CNET too. I've got to agree that getting something for free is very appealing. The reason I just don't even bother with trying to find some third party service to get free music is because I'd rather pay the small fee and know that I can just load the song or video to iPod without even thinking about it. I don't have to "figure out" how to get the file to my iPod, iTunes has already done the dirty work. I just click "Update iPod" and it's done.. iTunes Music Store is also briliant for importing CD's that you already own. The way that the music is organized and the amount of info about a song or album that your playlists are organized by is great. I think people need to stop complainng about iTunes music store and realize that it is the best out there for many reasons.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic appearance and performance, iTunes soo easy to sync with, added extras. 
Cons:. battery life which can easily be solved by purchasing a battery pack. 
Summary:. I simply cannot understand why the people at cnet.com are suddenly starting to hate the extremely successful iPod. It is simply so nice and easy to use; just think about iTunes and organise that and you can forget about your iPod as it takes it all in without worries. Why does Molly Wood and James Kim brag against it so much in their podcasts? I used to like Ms. Wood but now her comments are getting to me especially now that I actually have a iPod.. She gawps at the fact that you can connect your digital camera to the Toshiba gigabeat S as if it's some exclusive feature when you can easily do the same thing on an iPod using the camera connector. The gigabeat s has similar battery life to the iPod but they just make fun of the iPod's short one. Come on don't be like that!! Apparently they all have iPods but they still make fun of them. And apart from all that why is not having all the accessories included with the iPod seen as a con? I think it's more of a pro thing coz like you don't have to pay for an accessory which you might not necessarily want to use such as the power adapter so that simply keeps the final cost of the iPod down. If you need it, just buy it! I like Apple's way of not forcing them out to everyone who wants an iPod! I really used to like CNET's commentaries and podcasts but they are getting rather biased and annoying... bashing continually at the most successful mp3 player and coming up with alternatives which they themselves say aren't really up par with the iPod in appearance for example. Just accept that they're massively successful and quit your moans and groans.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simplicity, functionality, design. 
Cons:. Dock and power connectors are extra. 
Summary:. I've been thinking over getting music player for almost two years. I finally took the plunge and got the 30g 5g. I own an iMac and a Powerbook but even so I was still surprised by the ease of use and quality of the iPod. Now my wife wants one!. I decided on the 5g 30g because at just $50 more you get almost 8 times the storage of the nano. I have A LOT of music. I did not really care about the photo and video aspects but while setting it up and transferring my music I loaded some of my photos and one of my home videos. I was astonished at the quality of the video.. I realize that Apple has its fan boys and its haters. The simple fact is that from Macs to OSX to iLife to the iPod, they create a simple intuitive user interface that is second to none. Yes, they are proprietary and not the cheapest in any category, but the get how people interface with technology.. I highly recommend the iPod 5g.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek design, ease of use. 
Cons:. No dedicated volume rocker, slow sometimes, scratches easy. 
Summary:. I've had this device for almost 3 months now, and I love it. Both the device itself and iTunes are very easy to use. I choose this over the Cowon X5 because of the ease of hotsyncing this to my PC. With the X5 you apparently have to manually put everything in, with the iPod you just plug it in and iTunes does the rest. The X5's method is good if you want all your music in a certain organization, but I much perfer just scrolling through artists/genres.. My only gripes are simple ones that you don't really think about much. The first is that there isnt a dedicated volume rocker. If your listening to music while playing a game or such, you must navigate back to the now playing screen to adjust the volume, though the pause and play buttons work wherever you are in the menus. I've also noticed that when you want to get back to the main menu, you have to press the menu button several times. If you do this fast like I do, the iPod will experience a small bit of lag. No big deal, but it would be nice to have a way to imediately access the main menu. The device also scratches easily (hardly noticeable on the white version though), and the chrome backing and the black version collect and show fingerprints like you wouldn't believe. Easily polished with a shirt though. The included sleeve is pretty wimpy, mine came apart.. 

$$;
Pros:. great music and good video. 
Cons:. come with no extras. 
Summary:. I really like my ipod and i think it is woth buying. the video is very good if you have a proper videro converter. i have 10 full sized movies, 15 half houir show and about 50 music videos and 1400 songs and my ipod is only half full. 

$$;
Pros:. Great design, user interface, large screen, couldnt be easier to use, great sound quality dispite rumors apple haters like to throw around, its got the aplleness. 
Cons:. Suspect battery life for video playback, screen could have more color. 
Summary:. THeres not much to dislike when it comes to this iPod. Looks great, feels great, works great, its just great all together.. But there are some minor hangups. The biggest one being the video playback only last a little over two hours, which is enough for most cases, but still could be longer.. Ans while its a nice screan, watching it near a creative zen vision m, is one the few things the vesion has over the iPod.. And it scratches easily. but due to its extreme slim design, i cant put my iSkin on (iSkin.com) and its still thinner than the creative..

Pros:. It's actually free. I received mine now I am working on my gilrfriends. 
Cons:. none. Well, you have to wait for 5 people to sign up!.

Pros:. Sound quality, design, Screen resolution. 
Cons:. poor battery life for video. 
Summary:. I just got my white 30gig one from costco couple of weeks back. It was just 289.00 with costco full refund policy for members even after one year. I have put my entire music collection on it just over the weekend with Itunes. Getting photos was not very easy as my Kodak software is not compatible with Ipod. I had to copy desired pictures to another folder and then sync up.. I was really amazed at its ability to play photo slideshow and play music seemlessly that it never even skipped once.. I was also able to put some of my video captured thru my digi camera as it was already in .mov format. Videos look really cool. I read somewhere that Creative Zen vision M can display more colors that Ipod but i was not able to make out the difference. I am not a photo expert but to me it looked good.. I was also able to output my pictures and video to a tv yesterday using standard Camcorder A/V cables (no need to buy apple cables for this). Switch the red and yellow RCA jacks when you connect to the TV or Home theatre reciever. Ipod sends video signal thru red instead of yellow. This trick worked and the looked awesome.. Frankly speaking I don't care about a FM tuner as I have a large collection of music. WHo wants to listen to FM when you have your entire music collection with you???. My next project is to put a DVD on my Ipod. I have downloaded all needed software. I will update this post when I do it.. 

$$;
Pros:. so easy to use, to sync, has games, plays video, is perfect!. 
Cons:. no FM tuner, slight lag on video. 
Summary:. Absolutely wonderful product. i love the iPod and use it all the time. The only thing is that sometimes there is a slight lag when i press play for a video, but otherwise the iPod is perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim and sleek design. No noise although i can feel the technical movements of the hard disk when watching videos. Good price for a 30Gb Ipod hard disk. Great audio and video.. 
Cons:. Unlike Creative Vision M, Ipod Video can only play MP3, AAC and mpeg4 videos.. 
Summary:. DESIGN. Ipod has again surfaced itself to be the fashionable MP3 gadget of the century with its new slimer, wider screen version. Abslolutely sleek and of chromed back.. AUDIO &#38; VIDEO. Audio wise, the clarity of the sound can be heard and experienced (compared to other MP3s) but to a minimum. Perhaps i need to get the earphones replaced with a better one. I did not expect myself to give 2 thumbs up for its video clarity until I played some of the video podcasts and i went "wows". It is clear and absolutely sharp. Imagine you are squeezing your desktop video onto a small screen (2.5 inch). Perfect!. CLICKWHEEL. Same as previous models. Sensitve. Definitely have to lock the Ipod when placed inside my bag.. OTHER EXTRAS. I would say people getting Ipod is not really into its calendar/ notes/ games/ screenlock functions. It is just too troublesome to sync my calendar with outlook intentionally. The games are old except for these times they come in color (Ipod Photo). Screenlock to me is judged by something redundant unless i have some contacts that need very very discreet handling. But in this case, i think my handphone will be perform this function better.. PHOTOS. Clear and sharp photos. But the limitations is it has no zoom function. On the otherhand, it has great slide transitions with accompanying music of my own. I do all the settings myself.. PODCASTS. Alot of podcast can be downloaded from the Internet. Simply easy. Just go iTunes and download or search via Googles.. NO ADAPTOR &#38; CHARGER. There is no adaptor for charging. I charge my Ipod thru my PC via the USB sync wire supplied. But this does not pose as a big problem as there are many third parties chargers selling everywhere.. MY VIEW. Get an Ipod only if you like its design, its beauty and its brand. Buy without hesitations if you prefer its audio and superb clear video capability. But do think twice if you want a multi-tasking MP3.. Consider these b4 getting an Ipod video,. 1) No FM/ AM (but the radio remote earpiece can be purchease easliy) Money money.. 2) No bundled software that converts the video (Videora has the converter to do that just for Ipod and it's free!)(Quicktime is provided, enabled me to convert my MP3s to ACC). 3) Limited types of files; ACC, MP3 and Mpeg4 compared to its rival- Creative Vision M.(avi, mpeg, mp3, wma etc)(Well, ACC's quality of sound is better, Mpeg 4 video is sharper). 4) Short battery life (Battery's life is short if the screen backlight is on simultaneously) (Was rumored that for video viewing, it's up to a 2hr max.) The problem will be easier if a charger is purchased.. 5) No card reader (unlike Creative Vision), but card reader can be purchaed. Money OUT again.. 6) No recorder. If you are in an urgent meeting/ lecture, a recorder would be your life-saving gadget when there is no pen or paper available. But once again, that can be purchased, so money again.. I cant really list out all for the review. I bought Ipod video for it is an Ipod. I remember once my colleague went into an Apple shop, the staff emphasized to my friend "Ipod is a lifestyle gadget, you have to pay for its other accessories". From my usage, i only need a music, video and a photo player and that is why i buy an Ipod video. And i do not have regrets as to now. Maybe perhaps after i bought the card reader , and realised the transfer rate or high battery absorption rate etc, i will come back to give negative remarks? Who knows....... 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen for videos, endless possabilities for music. (playlists, etc.), and cool extras. Works seemlessly with iTunes. 
Cons:. iPod scratches easily, extra skin a must. Hard to transfer movies to iPod for Windows users. Get no extras except for headphones. 
Summary:. Best MP3 player ever. It works well, easy to use, and videos are a nice touch. Plus, at this price, you cant beat the value. Spend the extra 50 bucks to upgrade from 4GB Nano to 30GB Video.... 

$$;
Pros:. video output was better that expected. 
Cons:. screen is too small. 
Summary:. I agreed with Steve Jobs for the longest time that no one would want to watch video on an iPod. But I never watch the iPod videos on the iPod it self, I watch it on a monitor or a video projector in the smart rooms where I work. The addition of video makes this more than just a person music player, I use it as a presentation tool in the class room. If fact I've been putting my power point presentations on it so I don't have to depend on the installed computes anymore. This is the future.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound. Organizes songs very well. Easy to operate.. 
Cons:. They could have included power adapter. Battery life.. 
Summary:. This review is based on use for music. I have not used it for videos very much (not interested enough, I guess), but was very impressed so far.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great produc in general. 
Cons:. Poor video life, need a actual charger, rather than trough the usb cable. 
Summary:. In general, I like this product. Slim design. But I dont like the case they give us. It gets dirty real fast. One serious problem that I have about the product,is the chargine method they want us to use. They want us to use the USB to charge, that requires the computer to b on while chaargine... Very inconviencient(spelling is bad). 

$$;
Pros:. Video is actually watchable--can you believe it?. 
Cons:. Can't put any other vendor's locked music on it. Erratic iTunes interface. 
Summary:. Just two key things I want to say here.. 1. To my surprise, the video is actually pretty watchable on that tiny screen. Reason: The way US TV works, you get exactly the same pixel count on any display, whether two inches or 56 inches across. So a tiny display is more crisp, which is actually a fair tradeoff for the size. Heck, let's face it--regular TV has very poor quality image--thus the interest in HDTV.. 2. Apple has a higher reputation for interface than it actually deserves--thank you, Microsoft! It will take you a while to figure out how iTunes works, how it gets stuff onto the iPod, how you delete stuff from the iPod--hint: you have to set updates to Manual, if you can believe it--and most of all, why it adds files to your iPod sometimes, and sometimes not, according to no obvious pattern. You upload stuff, and can't figure out where it is--Apple's autofiling &#38; categorizing system is just plain nuts.. Of course, there's no documentation--because this is Apple, we don't need no stinkin' documentation! Yeah, right. First thing, go to the iPod area of Apple and download the PDF docs. They are somewhat incomplete, but it's better than trying to guess your way through a system they clearly think is too obvious to need explanation.. A final comment; As of mid-January 2006, you simply can't get stuff like cases and peripherals for this machine. They aren't out yet. So your screen will get very scratched while you're waiting. A. nd Apple's weird naming conventions--this is, by the wway, a 5th Generation iPod, and that's how add-ons are labeled for compatibility, but you'll hunt forever for any reference to generations on the iPod packaging or docs or Apple site. (CNET is the only site that correctly and completely labels this the "Apple iPod 5G (30GB, video)." To Apple, it's an "iPod 30GB." No mention of the most OBVIOUS distinction--"video"! How lame is that??. 

$$;
Pros:. great music quality, good battery, brilliant display for videos. 
Cons:. kinda hard to see without backlight. 
Summary:. it's been said before, great product that now plays videos. Not sure why anyone would want to watch more than 15-20 minutes of video on such a small screen, but for videos and short tv shows, it's excellent. couldn't believe how clear and sharp the video quality is for such a small device.. I've got an ipod mini, the screen on which I can see in normal light without the backlight. wish this were the case with this ipod.. what makes ipod king is ease of use (what makes apple great is the same).. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use interface, iTunes compatibility, easy to use click wheel, good sound quality, able to play videos, podcast and video podcast capibilities, etc. 
Cons:. Poor battery life for video playback, scraches easily but not as the nano, video may not be able to transfer because bad conversion. 
Summary:. It's the best iPod I have seen, but there are still some flaws that needs to be fixed like video playback battery life and those bloody scratches. I got a few on my screen already. Otherwise, it's the best iPod I have ever seen.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, small, thousands of accessories, well made. 
Cons:. Short battery life for video. 
Summary:. I did the research and this is the mp3 player to get. It integrates with your car radio, and home entertainment system.. If you get one, get the extended warranty it is worth it. The other MP3 players that I looked at did not have extended warranties. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen resolutiion, capacity, scroll wheel. 
Cons:. Battery life could be better. 
Summary:. I've owned the 5G iPod for about a week now and I'm very impressed with the product so far. Some of the reviewers of this item are forgetting that the iPod is an mp3 player first and a video player second, therefore, it does lack some of the more advanced video features of some video players. I think the iPod with video does a great job of mixing music, video and photos, the color screen is one of the best parts of the whole package. I'm definitely an Apple fan for life now!!. 

$$;
Pros:. music, video, photo, podcast, everything... 
Cons:. really expensive. 
Summary:. i am 13 years old... and i have owned over 10 mp3 players. when i first pulled this thing out of the package i thought it was not very sturdy and would last long. so far it has held up fine. you can get a slim and sleek ipod with the cabilities of video, music, photos, and more. even play games and more. the battery life is great for music and viewing photos and the battery life for videos is just okay. the screen is pretty nice and big but yet stays portable. this ipod has the greatest sound and video quality i have ever seen- it works seamlessly with itunes, and you can have your whole multi-media collection at the palm of your hand. i highly recommend this ipod video over anything else. i think they did great with the nano, but the video ipod os just breathtaking. a sleek, slim package with the ability to stay in good condition, look cool, and store all of your multi-media with great quality. i love it. 

$$;
Pros:. colour screen, good sound quality, big storage, video. 
Cons:. battery life is no way 14 hours, screen scratches easily, no wall charger. 
Summary:. Ok iv'e read alot of reviews of this item on this site and there seems to be alot of complaints about the video feature. Well the screen might be small but it wouldn't get any bigger. Just think if this item's size was designed any bigger, then everyone would complain about it being too chunky, 2.5" screen is the perfect size for this product and the video feature is exellent. Good picture quality and everything! other mp3 players that have video feature are not as good as the ipod's video feature. Other mp3s. with the video feature tend to use motion jpeg quality videos to play that are fairly pixelated whereas the ipod plays 30 fps quality videos that is in very good quality. Now why worry about the fact it can't play mpeg1 videos? just simply convert mpeg into mp4 using software such as cucusoft. Now would you rather have the video feature than not have the video feature? and why buy music and videos off Apple's online store? ever heared of P2P file sharing programs such as limewire?? you don't need to buy music and videos from it because whats the point when you just download all this stuff for free? try downloading limewire and its free. Then you would never have to worry on spending money on songs and vids after spending all that money on the actual product. Now what really annoyed me is the fact that it didn't come with a wall charger, and you have to charge it up through the USB 2.0 to the computer, but this isn't stopping me from going out there buying one. The ipod video is the perfect MP3 player full of features that have evolved from all of the previous versions of the ipod. The thing i have to warn you about is how much care and pressure you put on the front display. This item is abit dodgy when it comes to fingers and thumbs. Scratching this product's screen aint impossible and it can even. ruin some of the imagery when watching videos, Although i personally have taken extra care of mine and that the screen has minor scratches but not noticable when viewing videos, etc. The. metal mirror at the back of the ipod can get. smothered with finger prints but are easy to clean with a cloth. The headphones that come with the. ipod are good compared to other MP3 players.. these headphones can play the music rather louder than most MP3s and higher quality.. The ipod is meant to play songs in near CD quality which ive noticed other MP3 players don't as my old one played tracks in crap quality and sounds "out of tune". What will amaze you the most about this product (30 gb and 60 gb) is the amount of information it can store for you on something fairly small and thin. Its a must buy if you wan't the future to be held in the palm of hands. This product really is incredible!. 

$$;
Pros:. nice bright screen. 
Cons:. really bad battery life, videos are expensive. 
Summary:. The ipod is pretty nice but the videos are too expensive to be 1.99. In order to convert the videos you have to convert videos which can take hours. All in all i give this a ten since you can get it for free at http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=19844790. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen, thin yet comfortable to hold, excellent wquality build. 
Cons:. Obviously videos aren't the big thing here, it only supports two types and you need to do a buncha converting to watch them.. 
Summary:. I wrote a negative review about maily the video part of the player. I did not purchase this player for video. I purchased it for photos and audio, which it does very well, and at great quality. For all the ipod-haters out there, I used to be one of you. I figured ipods were merely purchased either due to cnet's obvious bias, or their fashionable appearance. I purchased in June '05 an olympus M:Robe (for $199, read review), because it was a nice alternative to the ipod mini. What i didn't realize is that there was an Ipod available with a color screen, and 4 times the memory for merely 100 bucks more. The price on the ipod videos is just amazing. They are solid, and feel great in your hand. I am telling you, don't buy one because they look nice, buy one because they work, and do a great job at what they are meant to do. I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound, good video play back, slimmer, new great features, awesome looks, easy to use, seelessly integration with itunes.. 
Cons:. Bad battery life for video, decreased audio life by an hour, new plastic front easy to scratch, all current top mounting accessories no longer work.. 
Summary:. The new ipod is the best one to date. it sounds great, it looks great, its slimmer, 30gigs and 60gigs for the same price as the older one ad its easy to use. But apple keeps surprising us with every ipod release, maybe next year there will be an ipod thats half the thinness of the 30gig. Thats one of the reasons its the best ipod yet, not as found on the video "must have mp3 player: ipod", which james kim refers to it as the best ipod ever.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful Screen, Great Sound, Great for watching last nights missed tv shows on the bus, and its DEAD SEXY!. 
Cons:. Batter Life could be better. 
Summary:. This is a great product I've had mine now for a couple weeks and i love it. I highly recomend this product, buy this ipod for me was quite a step up from my 256 iriver player, now i can hold my whole collection of music instead of a max of 50 songs. Many people are complaining that the ipod still has no radio or voice recorder, but i had those on my previous player and i only used them ones or twice when i first got the player. So for me this was not a problem. So 9/10. 

$$;
Pros:. Great easy to use design, sound and video are outstanding, the lovely choice of 30 and 60 gigs. 
Cons:. Only con is the scratch factor....and gettin videos on it. 
Summary:. Ok lets get one thing clear right off the beginning of my review....i was never a crazy fan of apple and i was leaning on this one but i decided to jump at it...This is not a biaists review..... Apple has continued to shock us with alot of their gagets starting with the macintosh computer and now into the big and popular iPod stoop.... remember i was never crazy about apple..... I bought my iPod video the other day at my local bestbuy...Right out of the box i was impressed. The sleek design with its shiny glow and the same ease to use click wheel. I tested its iTunes capability and the ease of use there was outstanding...let me tell you, if you want an easy to use top notch MP3 player go with this...I automatically put some songs on the device...then i attemped to input a video onto the iPod....not to easy...as we all kno now, iTunes is charging for their videos...$1.99 each...well i searched and searched for a software that was freeware and finally found one...Videora iPod Converter....this freeware allows you to convert the videos into iPod format...it worked...this converter worked very simply.... Overall this product is an excellent audio player with video on the side...THIS IS NOT A PVP...the video quality is good and the audio is excellent...steve jobs called it an added bonus...thats excatly what it is...If you are looking for a PVP that is for mainly videos i would go with somthing like the Archos or the iRiver...those are good PVP's..... Well apple surprised me...i Love my beautiful, easy to use iPod...its and audio player with the video as icing on the cake...go for it...its a great product...the scratch factor is a problem but make sure u buy a tough skin protective case...thats it...hope i helped everyone out with this review.... plz comment i would like to hear what you have to say.... iPod video...9 out of 10. -MG...none biased reviews.... 

$$;
Pros:. too many to list. people who bought other mp3 players wish they had waited for this.. 
Cons:. video battery life.. 
Summary:. Im tired of seeing all of these reviews people wrote before the product was even released. This is an amazing mp3 player and I love using it. Its hard for me to believe some one would actally haul around one of those bricks made by other companies. I give apple another year or so, thats when they will have 100 % marketshare.. 

$$;
Pros:. video capability, smaller, better sound quality, larger screen, longer battery life. 
Cons:. have to use itunes. 
Summary:. This is the best Ipod they have made yet. Many websites have given it 5 stars. Now you can get 30 gig video ipods for free. Its really easy all you have to do is type all of the link into your address bar and go to the site and they will guide you through the quick process step by step.. www.ipods.freepay.com/?r=23762675. This is completely legitimate! Their site is backed by CNN, Wired Magazine, G4TECH TV, MSNBC and Fox News!!! They have already shipped over 20,000 absolutely free. Don't miss out!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound and controls. 
Cons:. Some minor glitches and expensive videos.. 
Summary:. I have never owned a ipod nor any other hard drive mp3 player. I searched for at least 4 weeks through all the reviews on Cnet to find the best possible mp3 player. I had decided to get the Creative labs zen micro 6gb for 199.99 until I found out that the headphone jack broke. Which I found out that it did when I went to a store and started listing to it as soon as I jiggled the headphone jack it broke.. Well I have always been a advocate for any type of mp3 player except for apple. But after much hesitation I decided that for the price you cant get anything better.. 1st of all its a 30gb player which holds 7500 songs, second it plays the music nice and loud not soft like some of the lower end mp3 players. But most of all everyone is complaining about the video and how small it is. REMEMBER THIS IS NOT A VIDEO PLAYER FIRST. This iPod was designed to play music. Watching a podcast video or downloading an ABC episode is just a perk.. Over all the iPod 30gb for 300 bucks is a great deal, plays the music great and thats what it was designed for. Forget the FM tuners that others offer because you can get talk radio through podcasts and if you really want to mix up the music just use the iPods shuffle feature. And remember it has the longest warranty out of all mp3 player companies and you know what since its the most sold mp3 player ever theres not to many complaints about it. Except from the idoits that think its water proof or something.. I give the iPod video a 9 out of 10 forget the rest and come on over. Its eniveatable that you will eventually own one. I thought I wouldnt but here I am.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sounds for music and movies; Incredible screen; Great list of features. 
Cons:. Battery life for video; not a lot of accessories comes with it. 
Summary:. I bought the iPOD 5G (30 GB) about two weeks ago. It has been great! I was able to get all my music uploaded and playing within an hour. Video was a different story. You have to get a software that would convert DVD to MP4 and at first I tried a few demos and they did not work but when I finally found one, it has been nothing but a dream. True the screen is small but it is very bright and has been great to show off. Battery life is my only gripe. It would last close to two hours and that is barely enough to watch a full movie. So if you got a long commute on a train or light rail, you might drain out the battery if you are watching movies. I have been able to rip Stars Wars III and The Transporter and I am so impress with the sound and clarity of the screen. Video has played flawlessly. I have really tested this product to its fullest and it has been everything that I thought it could be and more. I even got my sister to buy one! Oh, only reason I did not give it a perfect score was because of the battery life. If it could double its life to like 4 hours, this product is for sure perfect. Thanks. 

$$;
Pros:. bright screen, easy user controls. 
Cons:. short battery life. 
Summary:. After owning a Creative MP3 player and getting the new Ipod, I must say it is easier to use. I like the way videos play.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek, Great mp3 player, Decent video. 
Cons:. Minimal delay in processing, scratches, low battery with video. 
Summary:. Overall, this is a great ipod... I upgraded from the 3G version. The 5G is MUCH sleeker! The screen is beautiful and you CAN actually watch video without size being problematic. There is some delay when scrolling/selecting... must have comprimised some processing speed for size (a fair trade if you ask me). Scratches easy!. 

$$;
Pros:. small, sleek, great looks, massive storage space, great screen. 
Cons:. limited support for videos at iTunes Music Store, scratch prone. 
Summary:. Just got this and I must say, I am most impressed! I never was a huge fan of the iPod; never got used to the click wheel, it always seemed big compared to other MP3 players and I never needed more than 1 GB worth of songs. But all of that changed with the iPod video! It's just amazing!. The screen is suprisingly good. The picture's crisp and videos are very watchable. It looks great with all the glossy finish and sheer sleekness. Now I see a proper use of all the storage space: I can use it to store videos and movies, and I'll probably be able to fit almost anything on this with the large capactiy, something that the PSP does not offer.. On the downside, I think iTunes should put up more videos on their website. But even if they do, purchasing videos regularly is not my peice of cake. I'd rather convert my DVD collection to .mov format and watch them while commuting to work. The player is also scratch prone, so remember not to take off the protective filming that the player comes packed in. I am also concerned with the battery life. Haven't been able to test that really well, but judging by previous iPods, playing videos could get really heavy on an already short-lived battery.. On the whole, I think this player is worth every penny. If you're looking for having a portable video and audio player in your pocket whenever you go to work, this is definitely your cup of tea. It fits in your pocket easily enough and it's most convenient to take almost any where.. 

$$;
Pros:. big screen, storage, everything else. 
Cons:. Does scratch more eassily than other ipods. 
Summary:. I got my 30Gb black ipod about two weeks ago and it is great. This is my first ipod; I have owned three zen micros in the past and all have had the same problem, headphone jack issues. Any way all my freinds think it is the best thing ever and people always want to hold and touch it. On top of great looks the ipod has great sound quality and it holds pictures and video. It comes with a nice case to prevent cuts and scrapes on the body but i still got one smaall but deep scratch on the screen. Over all this is an awsome player that everone should buy. PS: i found this web site that with customize any ipod for $94. Heres the link, check this out:. http://www.colorwarepc.com/. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Price, Amazingly Detailing and Colorful Screen, Easy iPod controls. 
Cons:. Video Battery Life, scratches easily i've heard but i keep mine in the nifty free case included. 
Summary:. I've been reading a lot of reviews of people dissing the iPod video. Firstly I'd like to say who the hell would want to listen to a FM radio when they have a whole 2 days worth of high quality songs. Also what's all this hype about the Archos. These players may have superior video capabilities but they're massive. You can't pop one in your pocket and walk around listening to music which is mostly what your iPod should be used for. Also videos for iPod are easy to get. Just put all your Dvds on your harddrive (temperarily) or gather all your downloads and get a video type convertor. You don't need to pay 2 bucks for videos. I strongly recommend Videora FREE iPod video convertor. Search for it on google. It provides quick idiot proof conversion of your videos into Mpeg-4's that can be put directly on your iPod.. Note: if you use this Videora know that it sends the converted videos to a file noted in setup: Video Output. Go to this file and simply drag the videos into itunes. (I had a bit of trouble finding my converted videos for a while. The Bottom Line:. The best MP3 player out there with an new extra video feature. You'll be listening to more music than watching videos so don't panic about the video battery life.. Get Videora for puting video on your iPod, works like a charm.. *If you're a student be sure to check out the student discounts on apple.com/ca. Saved me a bundle!. 

$$;
Pros:. Best image i have seen on similar products.. 
Cons:. Can only play .mov's and battery life when playing video. 
Summary:. First the good...a clear 9. I really didn't know what I was missing. I seriously did not see the value in owning another MP3 player, after owning multiple models and makes I just didn't see shelling out that much money for an over hyped product, I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. Even when the G5 came out I thought the same thing as before...Why? That was until I received one for my birthday 3 days ago. I was floored when started to play around. Yes it is my first iPod and I'm sure anyone who owns a G4 might not see the value in buying another iPod I would agree. Sounds is rich and clear, even with the standard ear buds, but if you really want to experience it try using the Bose noise canceling headsets, youre in for a treat. Slimmer and lighter than previous models. Now the bad news:. Yes the back is chromed and shows the slightest smudge and scratches so dont even think about not getting a real case for it. Look for the hard case with the clear face and the opening for the click wheel made by Contour. Other cases will cut off the screen and are useless.. Even though it's the video iPod don't expect to start putting your movies and video on it right away, you're going to first need Quick Time Pro and convert and compress them to .mov. Apple wants to make it as hard as possible for you to start ripping your massive DVD collection and putting it on their product. I'm sure their worried about piracy as annoyingly noted on the plastic cover "Don't Steal Music." Battery life could be an issue while playing video however in my book it is not a concern considering my portable dvd players battery only last for about the same amount of time so this isnt an issue for me, just make sure you buy your power adapter.. All in all I am very satisfied and am planning to have a very long relationship with iPod and apple.. 

$$;
Pros:. Color screen, music/video quality, video capability. 
Cons:. no belt clip included, no dock, or nice case. 
Summary:. I had been looking at upgrading from a mini to a ipod, and as I was looking, all of a sudden Apple introduced this ipod, so I decided I had to get that one. I have had it for a week now have explored all the capabilities. I upgraded from a mini, and I must say I'm glad I did. The color screen is great, and the video playback is pretty good. And unlike all the reviews, I get very good battery time for my playback of videos, TV shows, and music videos. Oh and although most of the older accessories don't have video ipod as being capatable with, MOST are (NOT ALL!), car charger and players, cable for stereo, etc. Oh and if you are a student at a college and have a college id (which these days what college doesn't require one?), use it!!! Online or in the apple store you can get a discount. You get 10% off, which is $40 for the 30gb. Oh and putting your own videos on aren't to hard. They say you have to use quicktime pro ($30), but if you are a college student (like me), PSP video is a great app that converts the video into the right file so it can be put on the ipod (ipods and psp both use same format). I definately recommend this!. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, sound quality, video capibilities, extended battery time. 
Cons:. Low battery time when playing videos. 
Summary:. I've had my ipod for about a week now and I'm very happy with it. I bought it primarily as an mp3 player but the video capabilities is a nice add on. I was actually more impressed with the quality of the video than I expected. I love the color screen and find the menus easy to read. Also very happy with itunes 6. This is a well designed player. Apple does it again!. 

$$;
Pros:. Super thin, photo and video, great screen, many features, great value!. 
Cons:. No extras at all, video battery life is poor, lengthy video conversion times.. 
Summary:. Finally thinner... Finally cheaper... Finally time to buy! I almost bought the Nano, good thing it was sold out.. This is not that much bigger yet the storage is over 7 times that of the Nano 4gb and only $50 more, wow. I do not see this as a pvp, I would not recommend someone to buy it as one. Although the screen is big enough and very clear, the battery life is very poor (2 hours if lucky). Since I wanted the Nano anyway, I figured I would buy this simply for the 26 extra gb for only $50. If you want a pvp then buy an Archos. But if you want music only, this is by far the best mp3 out there. There is no extras at all but all you really need is the usb power adapter, and you can buy a generic one for about 10 bucks. Bottom line is buy this for the audio and amazing portability.. 

$$;
Pros:. quite thin, clear screen, looks great. 
Cons:. my click wheel is off centre, short battery life for videos, lags a bit (12gb of data loaded). 
Summary:. After reading through heaps of reviews for the ipod 5g i finally decided to buy it. I placed an order on Friday and received on Wednesday which i thought was quite fast.. This is my first ipod, my RCA lyra actually just broke down 3 weeks ago. I'm so happy i didnt rush and buy the nano.. Its quite a bit larger than my previous mp3 player but the sound quality and picture quality is awesome! ... The only issues i have with it so far is that when scrolling through the menus it lags a bit (is this normal?) and my ipod's click wheel is a little off centre (barely but quite annoying).. 

$$;
Pros:. Large Display, nice and thin, good video quality, classic (and much loved) ipod controls, great software (iTunes). 
Cons:. Little included accessories, Scratches fairly easily (no worse than any previous iPod though), Screen Isn't quite big enough for confortable video viewing. 
Summary:. The iPod is, and has been for a number of years, the epitome of a great music player. It has great sound quality, great controls, and the sexyness that no other music player can compare to.. The newest edition to the iPod family is no different. It has great sound quality, and an incredible display.. And now, it plays video. The new iPod is a great device. Let's talk first about the newest feature, which is video of course. Something that really bothers me about other reviews is that all of them are judging the iPod soley on it's video quality. Keep in mind that Steve Jobs said, "The iPod is all about the music." He also said when he announced the new iPod that video was "a bonus", not a main focus. So, as you can expect, video isn't exactly great. The quality is fantastic, mind you, but the screen is really to small to watch a large amount of videos comfortably. The good thing is, you can store your videos, and then watch them on a TV via the A/V cables (not included). I've tested the video myself. The quality is quite nice, and for short films, it is rather enjoyable. But I'de suggest not buying it as your only means of bringing video on the go. So make sure you don't base your purchase on how good video looks on this thing. Remember, it's "all about the music".. Speaking of music, lets get down to the main focus: the audio. This thing has amazing sound quality. It sounds just as good as a CD. Imagine being able to bring about 700 CD's with ou wherever you go. That's about what you get with the 30GB iPod. Now, couple that with the generous display (generous among audio players), and you've got yourself an amazing device. Oh, and did I mention that it's thin? Well, look at it this way, it's over 30% thinner than it's 20GB predecessor. The 60GB model is actually 12% thinner than the old 20GB model. It' truely a thing of beauty. By the way, if you think it looks wider than previous iPods, your wrong. It's the same width, but the larger screen creates the illusion that it's wider. It really does look beautiful when you actually hold it yourself.. The iPod is a beautiful audio player. And with video as a bonus, it's definitely a good buy. You may think that $299 is pricey, but believe me, it's well worth it. This is definatly the best iPod yet, and I garuntee that if you buy one, you'll not be dissapointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent graphics, nice screen size for what it is, beautiful design, and classic iPod standards. 
Cons:. Short battery life, videos take too long to display, new click wheel doesn't always work. 
Summary:. It's an iPod for sure. Despite the fact that it doesn't have the charger, a dock, or any of the other extras, it is the best out of all three iPod's I've had (3G, 4G photo, 5G.). The H.264 feature makes videos look great (it made everyone's jaw dropped when I showed them the one I had from 2Advanced Studios. The navigation, as usual, is simple and lets you do more with less effort. Music is a joy to look and watch, as are pictures. Although many complain about the size of the screen, I believe that it is a nice improvement from where the iPod has come.. The 5G iPod certainly meets my standards, and lives up to the Apple iPod name.. 

$$;
Pros:. large screen, resolution, 30 gb is enough for me. 
Cons:. battery-life, dont no how to convert videos, a bit of a delay. 
Summary:. this is an absolutly awsome product! i love it i got it the second day it came out at the store by me. i was just wondering if anyone was having a screen delay. i know with my mini and nano whenever i push menu it goes to the previous page really fast. im noticing on my video one that its a bit slower. anyone else have this problem?. 

$$;
Pros:. 30Gb, 2.5 inch screen, unbeatable navigation, thinner, two color choices - all for the price of the 20Gb color iPod.. 
Cons:. Lack of accessories, but they are to come shortly, I'm sure.. 
Summary:. I'm honestly shocked at the lack of enthusiasm in these reviews. This iPod is by far the coolest gadget I've ever owned.. Background - I was finally in the market (meaning that I finally had $300 to plunk down) and searched endlessly for the "right" one. I have never owned an MP3 player of my own, though I have played with the older iPod's and a few other brands.. I purchased this iPod within hours of it going public (I almost settled for the color 20Gb until I heard the rumors about the video one coming soon) and I have been playing with it for one week, today.. Present - although I'm disappointed with the lack of accessories (specifically a case to keep my beautiful black iPod in pristine shape, but I'm very careful with it and so far so good) I would have to say that this iPod far exceeded my expectations. The sound on the included earbuds are great. I'm no audiophile, but I know what sounds good, and these things have wonderful clear low and high tones, and crisp and clear during acoustics. Album art...simply awesome! After you spend many hours (my MP3 collection is somewhere around 50Gb or so) jamming the album art into the tags, the iPod shows a pic of the CD cover right on the screen when the songs are playing.. So let's recap, so far...amazing sound, amazing storage capability, amazing navigation (honestly, who does it better?) and album art during the songs. Even if it didn't do pics and vid, I'm sold...but wait!. The color screen is amazing for pics...I'm always feeling guilty about not carrying around current pics of my little guy, but now I get to carry around as many as I want and play an awesome slide show on my new iPod.. Honestly, I could care less about the video capability at this point, a couple of the videos that I've downloaded were grainy, but they were free...so I wasn't expecting much. I don't ever expect to pay to download TV shows, but I will figure out how to convert my home movies and dump them on...as well as how to put other movies of mine on there.. So, a quick recap...Awesome (tried and true) music player with a huge screen for displaying pics, and it does video as well, in case you ever wanted to.. It's worth the money, if you can afford it (and your wife won't kill you for it) go and buy one right now!. Oh, and Steve J., in case you're wondering why not a 10 on this...how 'bout next time offering a case during a product launch...the little sleeve it comes with is nice, but I want leather. Nice job though!. 

$$;
Pros:. Best audio player ever, itunes, sleek, sexy, black and white, lots of accesories, also photo and video. 
Cons:. doesnt include an power adapter or anything extra.... 
Summary:. when will people understand that this is not a personal video player, you cant set this like a tivo like those archos things, this is just and ipod, remember last month! there wasnt even an Mp3 player this size that is mainly audio that also supported video, just like a 4gb flash player, apple came up with all this stuff and its really inovative so if u dont like all this new stuff that probably would take a while to exist if it wasnt for apple, you apple haters should go somewhere else!!... peace. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Sound, Ample Library, Great Design. 
Cons:. Battery Life for Video, Video Output Resolution. 
Summary:. I just love it when people rate things they've never used (see above comments). Take it from a "real" user...this thing rocks! Great video, great music, great photos...all completely integrated with my software...plus it looks great and is the easiest to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video adds alot; nice to hold; great sound. 
Cons:. video battery life; scratches easily. 
Summary:. I love this iPod the best-- I have a white 60GB and it's a geat value because of its added battery life. I swear this one sounds better than the 4G.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful, incredible screen, video, almost perfect in every way.. 
Cons:. Still want a radio tuner. Earbuds don't do the sound justice.. 
Summary:. Just got my black one today. Let's do the music player first.. As expected.. everything you love about the iPod is here.. best-in-class interface, great sound (though those earbuds still aren't up to par). The new screen is a stunner. Bright and big. Photos are better than ever. It's the best small-format screen I've seen.. But let's face it.. the sell here is the video component. Here's what nay-sayers are missing: quality, content, and ease-of-use. No other player delivers on quality the way this player does. It plays at 30 frames-per-second. Many other players will only do 15. The codec is clean and playback smooth. Desperate Housewives looks fantastic on the screen. It's not blocky or blotchy at all. Motion is fluid. Compare with other players before you think you know what you're talking about.. Now.. the most important point that everyone who dislikes this iPod is missing: CONTENT. Yes, $2 bucks for a music video is silly, unless it's a concert performance. But Apple has put together a delivery system that makes sense, and the implications should not be missed.. Imagine missing your team's ball game or a favorite T.V. show and downloading it the next day for $2 bucks for playback on a T.V. or checking out over a lunch break. That's the future. And you do all of this legally, and you own the video. The long-term implications of all of this are pretty amazing. How about downloading a video of the Green Day concert you went to last night.. again.. they have a delivery path that makes sense.. The last part of my argument is ease-of-use. Ever try and encode/decode/compress a video for a music player? Not simple even in it's kindest form. The Apple way? Push a button and it's yours. Just copy it to the iPod. Simple, easy and fun. You can't do this with other players. This is an impressive display of technology. Kudos.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its elegant design, it's light, easy to use. 
Cons:. Maybe too later than others in. 
Summary:. Apple has done always perfect designs for all of its products and i particularly like the design of iPod. I currently own an iPod shuffle and an iPod Photo and i would like to use i cant wait till i get one of these iPod video. It's so elegant, light, easy to use as every Apple's product.. 

$$;
Pros:. MPEG format, 75-150hrs video, the apple remote that works with the iMac works with the iPod. 
Cons:. FM Radio and thats it i think. 
Summary:. GO GET YOURS I'M GETTING MINE WITH THE NEW IMAC LOL. 

$$;
Pros:. Smaller Size, More features, Better Battery life, TV out. 
Cons:. 3 hrs of battery w/ video, only plays MP4. 
Summary:. This is a great product for anyone who wants the latest and greatest (even though most of you already went out to buy the nano). If your not looking for the newest gadgets i would wait to buy this one. Its a great product but its just a small step to what is to come for the next ipod. Right now there is only 5 TV shows available on iTunes 6 but comeon, give apple a break. It took years to build up the music library so dont expect all your favorite shows to be available right away. Right now there is a large music video library but the price for them ($1.99) compared to the price of tv shows ($1.99) doesnt really seem reasonable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge screen, beautiful, thin; music, videos, photos, podcasts, ect.... 
Cons:. Video for 30GB is only 2 hours. Low res.. 
Summary:. Its nothing new, thats a given, but so what? better late then never. I'm glad they released it, its beautiful, and has a great apple touch. I love the iTunes movie integration.. 

$$;
Pros:. the best screen on the market,. 
Cons:. questionable on whether you can put your dvd's on it. 
Summary:. I find it funny people all ready hate the video ipod so soon. NEWS FLASH nobody has it yet. Obviously this won't appeal to everyone because of the hassle of buying tv programs or music videos. So my response to the people who are rating the ipod video so low is, don't hate the video ipod just because you were over anxious and bought the color ipod. If you want an honest opinion on the video Ipod here it is. If you love the ability to carry all your picture and be able to listen to quality music and don't mind paying a little more I think video Ipod is for you. My question is why wouldn't they make it so you can put your dvd collection on it?. 

$$;
Pros:. Video capable, slim and has a big screen.. 
Cons:. No FM radio or voice recorder.. 
Summary:. Every body is jealous because they bought there crappy irock last month and they wont be able to buy this one! Everbody is just bad mouthing this one because they don't have it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video, Music, Larger Screen, 2 Colours. 
Cons:. Too Pricey!. 
Summary:. The new iPod Vidoe looks great! I won't buy one (too much $$$), but I definitely recommend it! Great job Apple!. 

$$;
Pros:. sound quality is better than previous models. it,s slim and it,s play videos.. 
Cons:. Average battery life.. 
Summary:. it,s an amazing ipod in ipod history. which is full with the features and larger color screen. overall sound Quality is realy clean. Bass is deep and clean. anybody who will own it. who will realy enjoy it,s sound quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. Larger screen, same intuitive design. 
Cons:. USB Only, no longer has a top port for the remote. 
Summary:. Well, since it's so easy to write a review BEFORE the product has been released, I'll give it a go.. So far, everything seems to be another great iPod. The expanded features, including the newest iTunes, is the start of a new way of thinking. I've had other MP3 players from other comapnies and NOTHING is even close to the iPod (and the universe of peripherals).. See how easy that was.. making a review before I actually have one in my hand !. Bottom line.. I'm getting the 60 gig.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tinner, and more functions, not to mention a good price. 
Cons:. maybe battery life since its not tested yet. 
Summary:. Looks great, added bonuses to previous models, I haven't but an Ipod for the main reason of having no Video Capability, now I have no Excuse, does anyone know if you already have TV shows and movies on your desktop if there is any conversion software to make it capabile to play on the IPOD?. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, great HD size, video, form factor, almost bargain price. 
Cons:. Non-replaceable battery, NO FM tuner, no included accesories. 
Summary:. Want an iPod worth the cost of admission? Take a very good gen4 ipod, make the screen bigger and add video support and 10GB of space. I think I'm on board for this one.. I've used other players and the bottom line is this: iTunes is better than anything else out there at keeping you organized and syncing your files seamlessly.. The only thing that would make this deal sweeter is an included all-in-one a/v adapter, charger, dock; but I have a feeling that you'll be able to find a pretty good aftermarket one before too long.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, music, photo AND video playback, sleek design, user interface. 
Cons:. battery life is likely to be disappointing, screen may be too small to watch videos on. 
Summary:. from the minute i heard about the new ipod, i was blown away with the all-round greatness it seems to offer. Video playback is a massive plus but the screen just dosen't seem to be big enough to watch videos on, which i will really decide on when i see the thing out in the wild. And the shows that are being offered are only being offered in the US at the moment, as i live in europe, the video content on iTunes leaves much to be desired with music videos and movie shorts on offer.. Overall, this ipod looks like its going to become the best ever. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Video quality. 
Cons:. Poor battery life. 
Summary:. CNET does a great job with reviews, but the specs are not right on this one. The iPod Video (5G) support video rates of up to 1,000 kbps not the 768 kbs that CNET said. The 30 fps and video formats are correct. Although if you do go up to 1,000, in my experience I've lost the sight of the volume and the seeking, but you can still skip and change the volume.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great audio, games and tv shows are a nice touch. 
Cons:. Not the best video player, iTunes video is expensive. 
Summary:. The iPod is a great mp3 player. Perfect for audio with good extras such as games, utilities, and locking.. By the way, what is up with all the Microsoft fan boys coming here to mess up the score of the iPod. I'm no Microsoft hater (I'm running the platform now), but it's getting out of hand. If you wanna talk about how great the Archos player is, go and review the Archos. People who come to mess up product scores truly don't have a life.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video Playback, nice screen, good battery life, nice pocket external HDD. 
Cons:. Slow at times, froze up a few times for hours, easy to scratch. 
Summary:. Christmas 2005, i finally gave in and asked for an iPod. Sure, I was about 5 generations LATE but I like to get things when I think they're at their best.. I loved this thing from the moment I recieved it!! It was my first MP3 player so I went to the top from the very start.. It did everything I thought it would do and more and I basically used it about every day.. A few times, slowness and freezing did occur which got pretty damn annoying and made me want to chuck this thing into a nice hard cement wall...but I held back.. I no longer own this iPod because I bought got fed up with carrying a lot of technology in my pockets so i bought a nice music/video capable PDA phone and sold this iPod. I still loved the thing though and actually DO plan on buying the 6G iPod when it hits the streets!. Either that or the iPhone. Apple has done an amazing job with the iPod line and I doubt they will disappoint in the future!. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek and Stylish Design, Crystal Clear Video Playback, Great Audio, Intuitive Scrollwheel, Tons of Accessories. 
Cons:. Short Lifespan, 2 Hour Battery Life (video), 4 Hour Battery Life (audio), Somewhat Delicate, Poor Apple Support. 
Summary:. Here's the lowdown. I've had 2 Apple iPods. A 20 Gig 4th Gen and a 30 Gig 5th Gen. Both died within a month after the warranty expired. On my first, the battery died and the battery replacement fee is $69. So I said "nah" and sold it on eBay. Then I purchased my sleek new 5th Gen last April. My 2nd iPod died exactly 2 weeks after the Apple Warranty expired. Don't get me wrong! It's an amazing MP3 Player when it works. Incredibly simple controls although the scroll wheel can overshoot files when looking through a large songlist. It has tons of aftermarket accessories like cases, skins, cables etc. The screen is super-scratchable, same with the back plate. I was disappointed with the battery life. I rushed out to the store and I was saying to myself "Whoa! 12 Hour battery! That's half a dayy!!" When I tried it for the first time, it might have been a max of 5 hours. Personally, I love Macs and Apple products but the iPod was the first product that made me think of what else I could buy instead of a 3rd classy new iPod.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great video quality, easy to use, like the navigation, great size. 
Cons:. Click wheel sometimes seems too sensitive, hate the earbuds. 
Summary:. Very nice product! Holds ton of music and video. However, I do wish I had bought the 60bg model. I like the quality of the audio and video playback. Also displays pictures sharply but wish I could zoom in on them. Great integration with iTunes. My dad thinks mine is so good he wants his own. Wish the price was lower (dont we all?). Overall, love the product!. 

$$;
Pros:. size, memory, ease of use, looks. 
Cons:. battery life, cannot convery most video for use. 
Summary:. love my ipod, works great as always.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen, easy to use controls, its an ipod. 
Cons:. battery life, will freeze on occasion. 
Summary:. I got my 30gig white iPod video for Christmas. I have used iPods before and they have always been easy to use. iTunes only makes it easier. It froze for 4 hours until i could get home to check the forums to fix it. I held down select and menu and it started up again and went on working. I have videos, pictures, music, and podcasts and it works great. I highly recommend. Support Apple, not Microsoft! lol.. I also recommend the AC charger. Not being able to charge an iPod away from your computer is unacceptable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Screen is kind of small, battery life is low. 
Summary:. The 5th generation iPod is clearly one of the best ones. As me owning a 30GB white iPod Video, I have experienced no problems yet. Although I am just a novice consumer for this product from Apple, I seem to know a lot about this mini handheld mp3 player. I really enjoy taking this around, but I have noticed that my friend's iPod has gotten lots of scratches on the screen, so I bought a screen protector from Apple. It works fine, and it protects the iPod. The iPod can hold 7,500 songs, lots of photos, and numerous hours of video. I love this mp3 player, and it is great in my opinion, there isn't much to talk about, but the screen for this is kind of small, and it is hard to focus on videos. Also the battery life is low, it runs out in a matter of hours. Other than that, this is a really good piece of machinery.. 

$$;
Pros:. alarm, stopwatch, sleep timer, wide array of accesories, have had no problem with videos, itunes easy to use, the list goes on. 
Cons:. lack of package contents, scratches easily, no fm or voice recording. 
Summary:. After looking around for a month I decided to get the ipod. After I got the Zen Vision M which I wasn't able to get to work on my computer, something to do with WMP. I was going to get a Gigabeat but I couldn't find it anywhere and where I could it was an extra 50 bucks which I didn't want to pay. The ipod may have some minor errors that people make to much of a big deal out of but overall I think it's outstanding.. 

$$;
Pros:. better picture than expected, substantial upgrade over previous player, extensive list of accessories and cases available almost ANYWHERE. 
Cons:. very sensitive click wheel, smudges and scratches LOVE the finish, requires a lot of clicking and scrolling to get from one menu to the next, THE STUPID EARBUDS DON'T STAY IN MY EARS. 
Summary:. I've had my iPod for about three days now. And to ensure that I find out if there is something SERIOUSLY wrong w/ it before my 14 day return period, I've taken it EVERYWHERE. The screen on this machine is a lot bigger than I expected - I was shocked at the clarity and detail that is provided. Perhaps my opinion of the screen size and image is favorable because I have no basis to compare it.. I just recently purchased an 20'' iMac w/ the Core Duo processor. My Dell PocketDJ would not work on the new machine. I avoided the iPod in the past, because only the snob-like kids around campus seemed to own them. Now, the iPod is ubiquitous here. Anyway, the iPod outshines my previous player by leaps and bounds.. The main problem I have with this player are the stupid ear-buds: when walking to class, I must keep my head in the forward position, or the earbuds begin to slip out of my ears. This is an easy fix, however...just buy new headgear.. Overall, I'm satisfied (so far) with the machine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great audio and visual- beautiful color screen.. 
Cons:. Hard to convert stuff to the right format sometimes.. 
Summary:. I really like my ipod.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of operation, song capacity, look and feel, size, sound quality (with decent headphones). 
Cons:. The earplugs that come with it are garbage.. 
Summary:. I finally broke down and got one of these things to put my music into to listen while riding the bus to work. And it lives up to the challenge. I use it strictly for music...I don't need to watch videos or photos on such a small screen. Everything on it so far has been great. But...I use a pair of Sony Studio Monitor headphones...because the earplugs that come with the thing are crap. No bass, no balance to the sound, and you have to turn the thing way up to hear the music good. And if you play it like that too long, your ears will be ringing for hours.. So...I say, get one. Just use some different headphones.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large capacity, extra video feature, big screen. 
Cons:. problems with video. 
Summary:. I had this before my Nano. It was good but I had many problems with video. So for those who are looking to watch movies and shows regularly, the iPod Video is not for you. But as always, it is an awesome music player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Display quality, ease of use. 
Cons:. Short battery life, scratches easily. 
Summary:. First the pros: I'm not sure why people complain about itunes. A lot of them do so there must be something to it but I love it. It's easy to use, easy to update the ipod. I like the tight integration of itunes and the ipod. The itunes music store is another positive.. Sound quality is very good, I like the included earbud headphones. Ipod navigation is so incredibly easy.. Cons: Apple rates battery life at 14 hours. This is a joke. Maybe if you lay it there with no volume and no backlight and just let it play you'd get some battery life. But I don't listen to music that way, I skip around sometimes within my playlists.. You MUST get some kind of screen protector and/or case. Apple should keep the included one, it's useless. The ipod scratches easily and shows smudges. I got a nice leather case for mine and I'm very satisfied.. I don't personally mind not having a wall charger, the usb charger is not inconvenient for me but I can see where it would be for some. I did buy a car charger which I use once in a while, due to the very short battery life.. Bottom line: This is not my first mp3 player but it is my first ipod. I highly recommend it. I like the quality and ease of use very much. The cons I've listed here are not to steer anyone away, but just to point out some areas of concern. Get an ipod, it's worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large display screen, can play video. 
Cons:. Average battery life for playing videos, doesnt support all video formats. 
Summary:. This is the best iPod todate! However, most previous ipod accesories have now become obsolete which really sucks. Also battery life is not that great when it comes to playing videos. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays videos, 30 gigs space, plays audiobooks, podcasts, great extra features. 
Cons:. poor battery life, no radio. 
Summary:. I absolutely love this iPod. I got it for my birthday about 3 months ago and I'm very pleased. Only a couple of things it can improve. Apple should make it more of a video iPod instead of just having video capabilities because the battery only lasts for 2 hours. Also there's no radio instead you have to by an attachment plus o voice recorder unlike the iRiver. But the content in iTunes is excellent. The variety is too good infact I bought a language audiobook in Hebrew. That's how vast it is. Overall, a great gift to have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful slim design, great colour LCD display (especially when viewing photos and playing videos) and easy interface. 
Cons:. No FM tuner and poor battery life for video playback. 
Summary:. Had this neat product for nearly 2 months and I can honestly say I love this little babe.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great intuitive music and video player; sleek style, nice screen. 
Cons:. Battery life is not as advertised, accessories are way overpriced. 
Summary:. I bought the black version of this right when it came out and for the most part I am very pleased with it. I bought it to replace a Dell DJ that I owned that was good in its own right, but just looked dated and didn't have a color display. The Gen5 ipod is beautiful to look at and works great as a music player and video player. I can also say that the way itunes integrates with it makes me wish I traded in for my dj long ago.. There are only two problems with the player but they are big enough that it could make some reconsider buying it. Number one is the high price of accessories. For instance, the ipod comes with a usb charger that you use to sync AND charge the ipod. It's neat that it can charge through usb, however, since it is very likely that you will need to charge this when a computer is not available you pretty much HAVE to buy the power adapter if you want to ever take the ipod with you on a trip. The power adapter is $30.00!!!! I mean come on apple! Now lets say you buy a dock kit so you can play it on your stereo while it's charging in the dock, etc. Well, the dock is $39.00 but comes with absolutely no cables. So, if you want it to charge while it's playing you'd need to spend an additional $30.00 for the power adapter, another $19.00 for an additional usb cable (unless you want to unplug it from your computer all the time) and say $5 for a y adapter to plug into your stereo. Oh yeah, and if you want to be able to control your dock remotely, the remote is another $29.00. Total, $122.. The second negative is the battery life is not as advertised. The battery life apple quotes is assuming you were to turn it on with a play list and NEVER hit anymore buttons. But who really does that? If you play and fast forward to other the songs, the battery will usually be out in 4 hrs or less. OK, if you are listening it to it on your commute; bad if you're listening to it on an overseas flight. And if you play video, battery time is 2hrs tops.. Don't get me wrong, if I had to make the purchase over again I would. But the price of accessories is infuriating and the battery life can be a serious issue depending on how you use the ipod..

Pros:. Amazing sound quality, many extra features. 
Cons:. company are not the nicest of people (botha pro and a con). 
Summary:. First off, like they say buy this rpoduct for is audio, not video. When i opend the box i was excited, it was so shiny and new lol. i couldnt wait to turn it on, and add all my songs,a nd check out what the video looked like. (Flaw when trasfering video to ipod format with quicktunes, i found it very slow with a measly 5 minuite music video). but this is an amazing device, i dont think i will use the video on it i mean thats what my laptop is for! but it is nice to know its there. and you will most lilkly come to the same conclusion. if you thinking of buying a mps player with aroudn 20-30 gigs, then also check out the icowon, and any other, you will find that others will ahve longer battery life, but there will not be as many acceseries for it then there is for the ipod. Now i know that every mac thing is over priced, its just a smart comapny. but that does not mean you can get descent priced gadgets for it, if you look at other brand names not on the ipod store then you will probally be happier.. When it comes to reviewing a product you have to think of it more then wow it has flaws because nothing is perfect. this device to me is perfect in many ways, and if you want a sexy and sleek mp3 player, which has nice features and is simple to use to a certin extent then this is perefect (of you have the money for it, that is). oh and i forgot the thing i dont like is that with itunes you cant do certin things, but there are ways around them, but unless you overthink things like me its fine. GOOD JOB apple, you doubled your stocks and made a good product, i no i lvoe mine. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim, sexy, same easy interface. 
Cons:. Just about featureless. 
Summary:. Everyone who complains about the iPod "Video" having no battery life to support the video usage is forgetting that this is actually the 5th generation of iPod. Which means, it's still music first people. 15 hours of music isn't bad. I own the Archos Gmini 400(same as 402 just has a compact flash) and the biggest annoyances about it are the short battery life, 10 hours and that in order to use it you need to use two hands. iPod is still supposed to be an MP3 player. In other words, it's made to make listening to MP3s as smooth as possible. For those who would rather use a MP3 player to listen to the radio, just go buy a satalite radio. Though I would like to see line in recording on iPods because i believe that's a great feature, the rest really don't matter. This player still does what it's supposed to do, play MP3s. Those who say this isn't a video player, you're right it isn't. It's just a MP3 player. If you want a video player go get the Creative Zen Vision or an Archos. Those are probably still the best two PVP choices out there. iPod obviously isn't listed under that title for a reason. It's still just a MP3 player, through and through. I recently ordered my own after testing out a nano and video of my friends. I should be adding more to this review after I get it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen, better bass, decent video quality, photo capabilities, slimmer than previous generations. 
Cons:. Terrible battery life, smaller clickwheel, slower than past iPods (playing music, loading music to ipod), extremely prone to scatches, had dead pixels on my screen (exchanged). 
Summary:. The new 5G iPod is an awesome music player and video is also a neat addition though it was never to replace PVP's (Portable Video Players)!!! I don't have any huge complaints except that my first iPod Video had a couple dead pixels and the battery life is horrible.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy transfer, holds lots of songs. 
Cons:. poor battery life, limited accessories, proprietary video. 
Summary:. I bought this for my daughter, who has been resisting mp3 players because of the hassle for years. On the plus side, she has been able to transfer photos and videos easily and very quickly - and it does pass the "cool" test.. Negatives - Apple has nerfed this thing. There are no accessories to fit it out on the market anywhere. It is the wrong size for current cases. They have done away with the extra intelligent circuit at the headphone attachement, so none of the current accesories (FM tuners, FM transmitters, etc.) will work with it. It doesn't even come with a charger - you have to leave your computer on all night to recharge the battery (which runs down in maybe six hours on just audio using the equalizer and dimmed album cover pictures). As far as video - without special software (not included), you can't even make your own. You have to buy from Apple at $1.99 a pop.. I did give it an "8" because my daughter is having a good time with it - although the battery issue and horrible scratches (even babying it) might change her mind when the newness wears off.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen, thin, black color option, video capabilities. 
Cons:. Scratches easily, not so good battery life, same crappy headphones as old gens, expensive accessories. 
Summary:. Well when my 5G ipod arrived at my door, I was very excited to open it and immediately installed itunes to test it out.. Aesthetics: If you have an older gen ipod the size is about the same but significantly thinner. I have the black verison and it looks amazing, but is prone to scratches and fingerprints.(I will probably invest in an Agent18 case or the Invisibleshield) The screen is magnificient with vibrant colors, but this easily drains the battery (more info about that later on). Oh yeah apple included a soft sleeve/pouch thing to cover the ipod, but it doesn't exactly prevent it from scratches because you need to take it out to use it.. Functions: Well you probably already know about the ipods mp3 capabilities and the click wheel, so I'll just get on to the video features. First of all, I should let you know I bought my ipod for its music features, and video was just an extra. I think if you have the same mindset as me, then this ipod will have a higher rating for you. Those looking for a portable video player should look elsewhere. Although the screen is great and movies/TV shows look great on it, the battery life basically kills this feature. I was able to watch Anchorman, but the battery was at red by the end of the movie. (Knights of Columbus!) People complain about $1.99 for a music video, but there are many ways to get videos on to your ipod easily without using Quicktime Pro. One program you can use is the Videora Ipod Converter, which is free (search for it!) and it converts all your videos to the correct format (mpeg-4). All you have to do with Videora is click convert, choose the video you want, select the resolution if you wish to change it (you will need to change the resolution if you want widescreen movies to look good; checkout ilounge.com if you need help on what resolution to use) In about 45-50 min, I was able to convert the full movie, Anchorman.(cartoons like family guy take 15-25 min on my Athlon 64 3500+ w/ 1GB RAM computer; not too long of a wait) From there, you can just locate the converted file and add it to your playlist in itunes. Then just drag and drop to your ipod as you would with songs (only takes approx a minute to transfer). The files you converted and transfered will be under the videos-&gt;movies section on the ipod menu and all you have to do now is click play and enjoy!. Well now you know how to get the videos on your ipod, but how does it actually perform you ask? Well the first problem is the slight lag that cnet mentioned. When you press play, it doesnt just play right away, but actually takes about 3 seconds. This not that a major problem, but it can be annoying at times (especially if you press play and your not sure if its the lag or that you didnt press the button hard enough :P )Once you get the movie playing though, I think you will enjoy the screen quality. I did not expect it to be that good, but the movies I loaded looked great, and so did the Family Guy episode. (The video has to be good quality to look good obviously)You can scroll through different parts of the movies by clicking on the center button, which brings up the scroll bar with the length of the movies (just like on quicktime\iTunes) and you can just use the wheel to scroll forwards or backwards. The slight lag will also occur when switching through different parts of the movie.. Battery Life: Um not much to say about it besides that it is not good when watching videos. I am used to using AA batteries in a CD player that last for months, so maybe that also contributes to why I think it sucks, but really..screen drains a lot of the battery fast. I would suggest switching the backlight to 2 seconds (default is 10 sec.) because you won't need the backlight on that long if you are just scrolling through songs, and it will definately help save battery. The backlight stays on the whole time if you are watching a movie so you wont' have to worry about that.. Final Thoughts: Ok it was a pretty long review, but I hope it helped some of you who are contemplating on buying the 5G ipod. Do I think its good? Definately. Could it use improvements? Yes but every product can be improved. I use my 5G ipod for music mainly, but I like having the video features and it is something I actually use occasionally. I don't see a time where I really need to watch a movie on the go other than on long trips, but as I said before, If you're looking for a video player this is probably not your best option because of battery life. Still, being able to watch Family Guy during class is cool or when you have to wait somewhere. Do I think it was worth my money? Yes I love my ipod, especially because of the 30GB space and it still does what it was intended for: Play music! Now to save up for those outragiously overpriced accessories!. 

$$;
Pros:. Design, connectability, very intuitive player, iTunes, good sound. 
Cons:. Scratches way too easily, no custom EQ option, poor headphones, menu somewhat clumsy, no easy way to edit existing playlists, no wall charger included. 
Summary:. This player is great for bringing your whole music library and some videos with you. I've encoded home videos and music videos into it, and the new, slimmer size rocks! I also ponied up extra cash to get the wall charger, the new dock and an infrared remote control. I love the setup, except that the remote will not allow you to move around in the menu, even though it has a separate "Menu" button on it. I'm hoping for a flash update, Apple!. The video looks good, as I've connected the dock via an S-Video cable to my tv. I'm also getting the media cable, so I'll be able to carry my home videos with me to friends' houses and hook up easily into their tv-sets. Encoding video for the iPod requires another $30 for QuickTime Pro, so they sure know how to squeeze juice from an orange.... My main beef with the iPod is the stupidly soft plastic surface. Mine has gotten scratches in a couple weeks, even though I'm paranoid about it!!! I always use the included case or have it on the dock, so how the heck does it get scratched up??? Apple???. Even though the EQ presets are pretty good, I'm still missing the ability to fully customize a setting to total perfection. The supplied headphones don't help. I've replaced mine with a $12 Sony button headset, and it sounds ten times better!. Another beef I have is that once you get music from a couple of different computers, like I do at home, you can't edit the existing playlists in manual control mode. The only way to manage them is to have iTunes automatically update the song library, which would erase half of my songs! This is a little too simplistic.. Even though I list a lot of issues, I'm still very happy with the iPod video and chose it over other similar players - over the media players because of size, and over other mp3 players because of the great sounding encoding, video support and great design..

$$;
Pros:. decent screen, video capable, thinner than previous generation. 
Cons:. video battery life, sometimes resets after hitting skip forward a few times, click wheel on the small side. 

$$;
Pros:. Vivid Color Screen, Extremely Trim. 
Cons:. Scratches Easily, No Wall Charger included, Minimal Battery life with video-watching. 
Summary:. This is definately a great upgrade to the iPod with color, now it has a bigger screen, hard drive and video capability. Minor things that aren't a big deal are that it scratches and that it doesn't include accessories like a FireWire cable or a wall-charger. I left the protective film on front, so that it won't scratch until they release a "Skin" for this model.. 

$$;
Pros:. 30fps does have good quality video. Easy interface and operation. iTunes and such, as well as the store makes for easy music to obtain. 
Cons:. Hard to import videos that are NOT from iTunes/Quicktime. Battery drains pretty fast for video and a little slower for audio (depends on how often you use the screen).. 
Summary:. I like the weight and size. The larger screen is nice. Great video quality. I've downloaded my own music videos from my collection and they showed up GREAT (anime music videos). I tried using QuickTime Pro to convert. THAT failed miserably - just loading a XviD file crashed Quicktime. www.videora.com! Videora has made a OPEN SOURCE, FREE converter JUST for converting XviD, DivX and more specifically to a G5 iPod!! Worked GREAT and loaded just fine. You can even queue jobs and whatnot. BTW, I bought this as a replacement for my mini that was stolen. About the same price ($50 diff) but better storage, vid capability. Personally I set the screen dimming to 2 seconds to cut down the screen drain on the battery.. 

$$;
Pros:. PLays video, music, crisp screen. 
Cons:. Battery life, no fm or line in recording, though aftermakret products are available. 
Summary:. Everone keeps talking about the archos av420. IF you haven't noticed, it's considerably more expensive. I've been researching mp3 players for agess now, and have even looked into the new sony walkman coming out (same price as ipod nano except teh sony is 20gb W/O colour screen). I can't poossibly see a reasonably priced alternative. The archos 402 in the UK atleast is around £30 more expensive, and it doesn't seem to fofer anything extra. The ipod has a whole 10GB over the archos, and neither can play fm.. If you think about the archos doesn't look as nice, the interface isn't as easy, and doesn't hace software that works seamlessly like quicktime.. In all honesty, it is one of the cheapest players which has such a reputation for quality behind it and plays video. No one can name me an alternative to it for the same price or price range.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video capability. Size is 45% smaller than previous models. Same price as previous iPod models, but more space on the "smaller capacity.". 
Cons:. Propietary use of Videos. iPod only works with iTunes + Quicktime. Polycarbonate face scratches easily.. 
Summary:. Apple once again has announced a new generation of iPod's. We started with the shuffle to answer the question, "where's the 'budget' iPod?" Then we saw the light with iPod nano, a "petite" version of the 2005 release of the iPod Photo. Along with the small space came a smaller price and smaller capacity. Now we are delighted to see the iPod recieve video capability.. Using Apple's well developed Quicktime Movie format (.mov) and other popular formats such as MPEG-4 the iPod can now provide video playback of movies, music video, home movies or what ever your heart's desire. Transfering the movies or video is easy as transferring your music, with Apple's Quicktime Pro 7. Along with that you can use Apple's iTunes to access the music store, which should now be deemed Media Store, to download TV shows, Music videos from your favorite Artist and other short films such as Pixar's CG Animations. The videos, priced at $1.99 are limited now but are likely to expand to many mediums come the end of 2005. So what are the key features of the new iPod? And what are the bad sides?. Apple's iPod has always been designed for style. It's a simple device that has a nice interface and a reasonable size. These features are most important to consumers. A lot of other products don't offer the same line of features the iPod has, therefore, most people cannot "see" themselves owning a device like that. Apple has won on this level over many years. But the downsides are still there.. Only links with iTunes. If you use Winamp, WMP (Windows Media Player) or another third-party media application you can't sync it with your iPod. iTunes does lack some subtle features that other players offer but the iPod still falls under that "ease and finesse" category for usability. We also hear users talk of poor sound quality from it's headphones and lack of bass. This is slightly true, but also consider the quality of the MP3 plays a big part in this situation. So before jumping to that conclusion a little more investigation on your part maybe needed.. So overall the new Apple iPod is a winner. And students you can still use your student discount. Also check to see if your school has purchased an iTunes license, like mine has (Drexel U) which allows you to download music right from the iTunes store, for free*.. -mo.Ose-. 

$$;
Pros:. Bigger screen, 10more gigs for same $, record in higher stereo, video.. 
Cons:. No FM, scratches easily,. 
Summary:. Im just curious if anyone actually owns one of these yet, I would like to get one but im poor and want to make sure that its worth the buy ive looked into the archos and ya they have more feature but there $100-$200 more then this product if someone out there has some real info on this product whether it is worth spending the money on lets hear it rather than bad mouth the product before it sits in your hand.... 

$$;
Pros:. Bonus 10 GB, thinner design. 
Cons:. Nothing, design is very strange, probably as scratchable as nano... 
Summary:. Everyone is either complaining about how stupid it is to have video; its just a freaking extra. It doesnt affect any sort of music playback capability. It has an extra 10 gb, and a larger screen.. MY POINT IS VIDEO IS JUST AN EXTRA.. 

$$;
Pros:. video larger hardrive. 
Cons:. no inovation. 
Summary:. It isn't that apple being inovative its that they are setting the bar.Also they are offering it cheaper. The ipod is what all mp3 players want to be, this causes a flood of very cheap mp3 players and apple had to upgrade the hard drive and functionalty of the ipod to justify a $300 price tag.That is why they still call it the IPOD.. 

$$;
Pros:. video, price, thin, itunes 6 episode prices. 
Cons:. how wide it is, screen size, bad timing on putting ipod out. 
Summary:. I like this new ipod and all, but i do not like the fact they put it out like a month after the nano, i feel sorry for all the people that went to go out and buy that tiny little flash player. Also, its a super small screen, they couldve went sideways and made a new design and made use of its rectangle shape. All in all, i like this new ipod, i just dont like the timing and the small screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally can do video.. 
Cons:. The true video iPod will be out sometime next year (ThinkSeceret). 
Summary:. ThinkSeceret stated that this is not the "killer app" that Apple has planed to come out in 2006. Steve Jobs said that the iPod will succeed because its primary app is still music, and the market is still not ready for video, acording to NY Times. I agree with ThinkSeceret in that they are working on a true video iPod, and that this is just a really cool iPod with video capablilty. When the "real thing" comes out it will have a widescreen, and the next "iTunes" will have full length movies.. 

$$;
Pros:. Thinner, Bigger Screen, Good Resolution, Same MP3 player. 
Cons:. FM Tuner would be great. Battery could be better.. 
Summary:. I was verrrry close to ordering the cowan iaudio x5l a few days ago until Apple unveiled this piece. I knew I didn't want the old photo ipod b/c cowan and sony nw5 were better 20gb+ options. The cowan x5l has video, 30hr+ battery, and I personally like the file tree system they sport. Plus the FM radio and voice recordings would be great.. But now.... Apple's video ipod no doubt has a bigger, sharper screen for video, plus it is much thinner than the cowan xl5. aghhh...makes for a tough decision. I guess it all depends on your personal preferences. I'm torn between cowans battery life and fm tuner to apple's smaller design and better video.. So I ask to you...is there a best of both worlds?. 

$$;
Pros:. Video, earbuds, click wheel.. 
Cons:. Software updates, synching can be annoying.. 
Summary:. I bought this a while back... so my review is late.... Perfect for what it's intended purpose is. I was very leery about trading my CDs in for a sleek mp3 player, but when I found out how reliable Apple was when it came to the iPod I thought it would be worth a shot. I wasn't disappointed. If I had reviewed this after I bought it (immediately after), you would've seen a perfect 10.. I can't give it a perfect ten though just because... well... the video is great but .mp4 is hard to come across unless you look for what's being pirated or you're buying from the iTunes Store. That's not a huge problem but a lot of my library is from CDs so I don't get to use it as a video player because I just don't want to PAY for the shows or the music videos... especially when I might already have them, just not in the proper format.. I also ran into issues when I would synch said iPod. Not that I was having REAL issues it's just that the connector is tempermental and did not like me one bit. It liked to jiggle and reset itself on my computer and then it would sync all over again. Was very frustrating. As for the software updates, there were two times when to install them I had to restore my iPod and then put all 9 GBs of my music library back on it.. But ultimately... I don't think that I'd be happier without the iPod and it's still too perfect as a sleek, small, and very potent mp3 player for me to feel that it's nonessential to my life.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen, click wheel, nice interface. 
Cons:. Lacks a shuffle playlist, hard to make playlists on the go. 
Summary:. I used to have a Creative Zen, and I loved it. It was bulky, sure, but held up to anything. I ended up dropping it and only broke the headphone jack. But it was 2 years old and I didnt know how to fix it. My boyfriend ended up getting me the iPod 30g Video for Xmas.. It has good sound, and I really like the large screen and the nice click wheel, easy interface. However features on my Zen that I was used to - making playlists on the go, being able to rearrange and delete/add songs at my whim - either arent useable on the iPod or arent easily explained. I also find it annoying that I only seem to be able to shuffle ALL the songs on the iPod, and not a specific playlist or album. I have a lot of music on my iPod that I may not listen to a lot, but I'd rather it have it on there than not.. Overall I enjoy my iPod, but things like playlist editing on the go and shuffling songs really annoy me.. 

$$;
Pros:. plays videos at great resolution. 
Cons:. short battery time. 
Summary:. it is a very cool product that lets u watch video and play music but the only things wrong with it is no bluetooth or wire less lan and a very short battery time. 

$$;
Pros:. Storage capacities, light weight, accessories. 
Cons:. Screen scatch easy, no external charger include with the 30G version. 
Summary:. I have been using this 5G Ipod for about 3 months. Music quality is good. Volume is adequate but at max volume, it may still be inadequate in noisy environment. The included ear buds easily falls out if not inserted properly. The screen is great but can get wash out in bright outdoor environment. I am having fun with all the accesories that is available with the Ipod.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large memory, same price. 
Cons:. Low battary life, fragle. 
Summary:. Though much better then old ipods, the battary life is very short unless you buy the 60GB model. You MUST have a case so add another $30+ to the real price.. Also you must use itunes, bad software.. Overall try and wait until other companies sumbit competing products, you will get more for your money.. 

$$;
Pros:. hard drive space, large display, compact, clever controls. 
Cons:. battery life, not many extras included in package, just a bit pricy. 
Summary:. My 2nd music carrier, I'm pretty satisfied with my decision. Warrenty is worth purchasing as an extra. Battery life is my only concern. Word to the wise: A good case is a must when purchansing this item. The videos are overrated, but everything else is adaquate.. 

$$;
Pros:. Still the sexiest audio player. 
Cons:. Whats the use of 3 minute videos. 
Summary:. If you want a legit video player, this is not for you. I'm a happy owner of a 3G. Was not convinced to buy a 4G just because of a better display. Still not convinced to buy a 5G until it allows me to watch DVD quality and hook it up to a monitor. I have instead a portable DVD player with a monitor for my travels.. 

$$;
Pros:. user friendly, bright screen, slim, good sound. 
Cons:. i suppose the lack of radio and recoding capabilities, mediocre battery life, comes with bare bone accessories. 
Summary:. alright, there are way too many whiners, complainers and idiots that have reviewed this item. and you know what? it gives no friggin useful information to anyone...so let a wise guy give the definitive review here to silence the squables.. audio...excellent. no big suprise here. all of the ipod series have produced good quality music even with so-so head phones/earphones/earbuds on. there are plenty of EQ settings to keep people happy, i know there are a few that want manual EQ settings...but seriously, the amount of people that can hear the difference between the "Rock" setting and if i eased the treble up one notch are few and far between. if you can, you should probably go work at Bose or something.. battery life...the biggie here. its not great, if left running continously, according to CNET it will run 14 hours. with the way i listen to, changing songs about ever 7 min or so, it lasted me....i'm guessing 12 hours (i had to recharge it after day 3 with about 3-4 hours of listening per session). that was achieved with close to the loudest setting and no backlight. your mileage may vary, but whichever way you cut it you can always use more battery life... video...the culprit of the whole bash sessions i read here. i tried the video, and honestly, i'll go with steve jobs here. its just an extra damn bonus...nothing more, nothing less. before y'all get your knickers in a twist, watching a tv show on a 2.5 inch screen was already tedious...lets not even get into watching a full length feature film. yes i know there are other PVP players out there, or MP3 players with video capability and i'll still say the same thing. you're nuts if you're gonna watch Lord of the Rings on a screen, any screen, maximum size of your hand. i let my friends try to watch videos on it and we all eventually held the ipod closer and closer to our faces. so did it matter to me that with video the battery life gets cut down to 2 hours? nope. for those who posted on here saying how great some other PVP or MP3 player with video capabilities has made their life...seriously, you're watching a tv show/movie on a screen smaller than the size of sliced bread. how comfortable is that anyway? i agree it makes for pleasant distraction for those who utilize mass transit systems frequently but for those who got the ipod for jogging/studying/easy listening/or drive their car to work...i doubt they will give a bunny fart about watching some tv show they missed. that being said, watching a music video on it...ok. watching an episode of sex and the city...err do-able. watching a ripped dvd/vcd/whatever...your eyes will die long before the ipod's battery dies.. user interface...if my tech challenged parents could use it so can you. if you can't, then my friend, you and i need to have a serious talk about your scholastic/academic/mental capabilities. jesting aside, it's hopelessly easy. you either scroll up or down, press the button (the big fat white thing in the middle) to select the option/menu you want and press back to get back out.. things i don't understand...why can't apple stick a radio on their? i see how it maybe ironic to have 30 gigs of music and still need a radio but who knows right? bare bones acessories? what the hell is going on here? i shell out 300 bucks the least they can do is give me a decent case, dock and charger to go along with it.. as for the rest who complain about how apple is a great big evil company...well get over it cafone. either you never took a course in business or your just too stupid to realize the most basic rule of business...to make money. if you have lots of shareholders, then you must make lots of money. of course they are going to change the ipod around at some point forcing other companies to either renew their contract or something. of course they are going to pump countless millions in PR to get their product out in the open. of course they will charge you money to buy video/music to go along with their products. and if they are really competitive they will limit their products to be only compatible with the videos/music they offer.. you don't like that? well tough luck. i'm not saying this because i like/dislike apple. to quote the Godfather on this, "it's nothing personal, it's just business" whether you folks out there like it or not, microsoft, apple, creative, iriver, samsung...are all about making money first. do you not think, that given the chance, creative or anyother company would kill to do exactly the same thing? but sadly apple was the one company that beat all others to the step.. and finally, to quote a previous reviewer...most people want to be able to plug their mp3 players to their computers and have it sync without extra configuration. ipod does that. most people want to get videos on their ipod by just plugging it in. apple does that. most people don't care whether it has video streaming, bluetooth, wifi, infra-red, manual equalizer, dolby digital, PIM tools, mpeg 1,2,3,4,....1098354 support, wma, ogg, rma and God knows what else. all they care about is that its easy to use and it works. apple does that. yes you can smirk with your all knowing smile thinking that 75% of the people out there are idiots for buying an ipod. you can smirk till you're blue in the face and it won't change the fact that the ipod, as hated as it may be, is still a very good MP3 player. but the truth is, in the end, will your superior wonder gadget be obsolete within 2 years, most definitely. will the ipod? yes. so whats the difference really?. this is the best and most freaking complete review so far that is UNBIASED. so i better not see anymore of you pezzanovantes come up with another smart remark about this subject. that's it boys, watch your backs and keep your noses clean..

Pros:. Audio,click wheel invention.... 
Cons:. Video+battery. 
Summary:. I have been an ardent fan of cnet reading almost every other available and trusting them blindly if i want to buy something new...but i dint really udnerstand how cnet rated ipod video as 8.3 with 2 hr battery life.!!!! you say battery life is sick and u rate is 8.3..thats almost flawless in most of the other reviews..... Cmon James Kim...are you listening?. Moreover..apple is tyiing up everything to its popular product and trying to make money much like DEFAMED MICROSOFT. People comlained about MS as they are shipping IE with windows. But apple has taken a step ahead...its asking customers to buy quicktime to dump videos...and itunes is only thing that can be used to interact with ipod...why not WMP???. Apples going down one days...

Pros:. Thinner than previous models, Now available in Black. 
Cons:. Difficult to transfer non iTunes video ??. 
Summary:. I will start by saying I do NOT own this model (yet?). I own a G4 ipod. Also I am NOT a sheep who has blindly jumped aboard the Apple-cart. I actually did ALOT of research into mp3 players before purchasing my G4 iPod. Sony, Dell, Rio etc all had some good qualities and some (battery life) better than ipod. But for ME and MY purposes the ipod was the best choice and I love it. As for the new ipod (and notice I didn't call it the Video ipod since that is not what apple is calling it either)it is just that - a NEW ipod. An ipod with a new feature - the ability to play video. When you go to buy an ipod you won't choose between video or non-video - its just THE ipod. Yes perhaps the Archos is better as a PVP since it has a bigger screen. But it is also bigger all around, twice as thick and twice as heavy. If you want a PVP get a PSP or an Archos, but if you want a device that you can really carry with you all the time that plays all your music (and also happens to show photos and video) then the ipod is great. Instead of everyone complaining about how Apples marketing have forced people to buy ipods - why don't you go buy some Apple stock and take advantage of their brilliant marketing..

Pros:. nice screen. 
Cons:. battery life sucks for audio and video. no accessories. 
Summary:. i dont really like it much at all. the 30 gig for $300 looks good but in reality all the stuff you want and need to make it a more functional mp3 player costs alot. And i dont like the smaller click wheel or the incredibly weak battery life.. i would go with the archos or the zen vision if you want a video player. They offer better battery life and more features.. Archos even offers a battery that lasts 15 HOURS FOR VIDEO and creative offers one that lasts nine. and that my good friends, is amazing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, sound quality. 
Cons:. won't play tracks sometimes!. 
Summary:. I was very excited about this product. I couldn't wait to watch shows on this unit. But after downloading one episode of "The Office", I was disappointed. The video playback doesn't "flow" very well. It almost has a split second lag at times. Forget about watching content with lots of fast-moving action.. Music player is great. It's easy to navigate, the equalizer is nice to have, and of course, there's itunes. There are times however, that a track won't play unless you shut off the unit and turn it back on after a minute or so.. It's nice to see that they're offering games on itunes now.. 30 gig is enough for me. I did a quick calculation, and figured that it will take about $6,000 dollars to fill-up the balance of my memory, with 99 cent itunes songs.. Overall, I think you'll be happy with this product..

Pros:. Good size, holds my entire music collection. 
Cons:. Buttons seem to stick. 
Summary:. This is my first Ipod and I'm a fan. However, I have had problems with buttons sticking/not working. At one point I had to let my Ipod completely drain itself because I couldn't get it to turn off. I don't know if this is an issue with newer versions. Overall, I am happy with the unit..
