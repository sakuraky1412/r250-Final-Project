though this place is titled `` guesthouse '' , it is actually quite like an hotel - our room was big and spacious , clean , very nice and modern bathroom , flat-screen tv , desk , couch and everything else an `` hotel '' would have - except breakfast .
there 's a very nice kitchen where you can make free coffee ( from a nice , swiss machine ) and tea , plus a dining area where you can eat food you bring in .
the heating was very good also ( almost too good according to the humidity on the windows . . .
) .
the place is very central - just outside the main street of akureyri ( though the center is really small , so do n't expect a metropolis . . .
) .
the only possible problem is related to parking - the parking lot near the hotel is limited in hours .
you do n't have to pay , but you have to present a card with the time the parking began between 10:00 and 16:00 on weekdays - and the maximum time is not long .
we were there on a sunday and on the next day we went out early , so for us it was not a problem .
the owner told us of a place you can park without it , but it is a bit remote .
so if you wan na sleep late - consider this . . .
fyi : there is no elevator , so if you 'll be in the higher floor like us you 'll have to carry your luggage there ( the stairs from the parking lot level . . .
