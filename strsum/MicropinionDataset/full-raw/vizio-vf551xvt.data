this is my 4th vizio product 22 , 32 , 37 , and now a 55 i bought vizo for my kids rooms/ college and the basement for my tv room with a big l shape couch samsung 52 b750  .
just like cnet told me to do  .
enjoy this big 55 inch with a play station 3  .
i have had this tv for almost 3 months  .
i have been trying to find a better value and have had a very tough time  .
after using the cnet recommended adjustments , but increasing the backlighting to 50/55 makes the picture that much better  .
standard is pretty good for sports as well  .
the matted screen is a must near my bay window and white walls  .
it makes the picture viewable during the daytime , which i had problems with with my old tube tv i have compared this tv vs  .
the samsung 55b6000 and lg 55lh90  .
the samsung picture did not seem as realistic , and the glossy screen is an issue , as well as off    angle viewing  .
the lg's picture is virtually identical to the vizio's , but the form    factor is much more bulky and bulbus vs  .
the vizio's the sound is good for a tv  .
obviously , a sound system will sound better , but for a stand    alone unit , it is actually pretty good occasional color    bleeding , but it is rare  .
smooth motion does occasionally look video    camera like , and sometimes it is neccessary with action movies , such as the matrix reloaded i like that the menus do not take over the entire screen like most tvs  .
it is relatively easy to navigate .
for your money , if you're looking for a 55 set , you'll be hard pressed to find a set of this quality i own a sony 32 hdtv and a samsung 40 hdtv as well i paid for the names  .
the vizio is far and away a much better picture vizio offer much , much more in the way of options for adjustment to picture and sound i say go now , buy a vizio  .
they prove their claim to be 'america's #1 tv'  .
i purchased this tv about one month ago and haven't looked at any others  .
after setting everything up i changed the picture settings to those used by cnet's reviewers and i'm very happy  .
i would recommend though to turn up the backlight setting to around 45    50 because cnet's recommendation is a bit dim for my viewing preferences  .
in reference to the vga port , there does not appear to be a local or smart dimming option for this port  .
my xbox360 uses the vga port for 1080p display and its a shame i cannot take advantage of the local dimming  .
other than that , i love this tv and would recommend it to anyone .
for the price , this seems to be the best 55 on the market  .
i've found the blacks to be amazing , the colors very vibrant , the sound is surprisingly good  .
i'm very impressed with the 4 hdmi ports plus all the others  .
very , very flexible we got it from costco for $1899 , which seems to be a very good price for this model  .
i waited about two weeks for the north austin , texas costco to get them in stock  .
i called saturday morning and they finally got eight of them  .
i wound up not getting to the store until about 5 and i got the last one on the shelf  .
these things seem to be selling like hotcakes  .
the only odd thing is that when we were setting the tv up , my dad popped the batteries into the remote and set it aside  .
about 15    20 minutes later when i is ready to use the remote to set the tv up , i grabbed the remote and it is very hot to the touch  .
the front of the remote had melted and it didn't work  .
i popped the batteries out but they were so hot i dropped them  .
my dad worked in the cable and satellite tv industry for about 35 years , and he is positive that he put the batteries in the right way  .
even if he did not    no modern battery    powered electronic device should be susceptible to damage from reversed batteries , especially to the point where the device melts  .
the good news is that vizio tech support gave me zero problems and are shipping me a new one  .
they also talked me through configuration without the remote  .
i am very happy with the resolution of this problem bottom line is that i am very happy with this tv so far  .
ignoring the low    cost attribute , it's a stellar tv  .
add in the fact that it's about half the price of some competitive tvs , and it's a no    brainer  .
this tv rocks  .
i don't find the physical appearance of the set to be an issue  .
the icons that light up on the lower left side are a distraction at first , but since they light up when the set is on , if it is sitting in the on position with no video source , it actually helps me tell that it is indeed on  .
so that's useful  .
i waited over 5 months for this set to be available and i've not been disappointed  .
i decided not to wait for the next version with widgits  .
no problem , turns out that we can plug my son's macbook pro into the set and show all kinds of internet content , and it looks great  .
i'm not going to put down competing products , other than to say that i really do not know why someone would want to pay $7    800 more , for similar or even less technology .
i bought a panny 54 inch plasma from costco that i was not very happy with , so i took it back and bought this vf551xvt instead  .
the tv is breathtaking  .
the picture is one of the very best i've ever seen , it looked better than the 1080p sony that it is displayed next to  .
with the panny , the picture looked decent when connected to directtv hd receiver , but it didn't have that 3d look when watching my bluray player  .
i is really dissappointed , even though i've always liked panasonic plasmas  .
i won't be returning this vizio , that's for sure  .
when watching hd tv , the picture is even better than the plasma  .
super sharp , like you're looking through a window  .
the colors look great , the blacks look as dark as the panny (thanks to led backlighting , or truled as vizio calls it) , and the sound is far superior to the plasma as well  .
bluray is like a whole new experience on this tv  .
even my wife couldn't believe how sharp and defined the movies look  .
definately has that 3d effect that the panny did not have the only dislikes  .
it's pretty thick , and the vizio symbol that lights white under the screen cannot be turned off  .
small price to pay for such a great tv at a previously unattainable price overall , i highly recommend this tv .
i'd been waiting awhile for this tv to be available to be purchased locally  .
it arrived in my local costco in clearwater , florida and i is immediately convinced this is my next tv as soon as i saw it  .
i bought it and had it delivered  .
i got it out of the box and connected to my devices  .
the 2m  1 contrast ratio and 240hz refresh rate are delivered as advertised  .
i am equally impressed with its performance with blu ray movies , directv hd , and video games  .
i is considering the samsung 8500 , but i am very satisfied with my decision to purchase this set instead .
finally a led 55 inch 240hz for less than two grand  .
it has a silver color sound bar at the bottom of the display  .
cannot wait to purchase one , although my wife tells me to wait for the vf552xvt coming out in december that has internet content updated  .
on nov 14 , 2009  .
i would buy set providing speaker bar if fixed  .
wife will not allow it i the house in red or chrome  .
oh well  .
until i go to ces next january , this will be without question the best under $2000 tv i will see this year  .
i do not even think the traditional black friday tv's can top this value  .
we installed this model today for a customer and it is awesome  .
they used this service www  .

ok , on to the picture quality of my 551 vs my 550 , , , in a nutshell , the 551 is a big jump in pq and in my opinion very much worth the upgrade , , , , , or , if your between getting the 550 or a 551 , , spend the extra money and get the 551  .
i put on the coraline bd to see how it compared with the samsung 8000 i watched it on the day before and the 551 held it's own in comparrison to the sammy 8000 , , , , the 3d look , the colors , the black's , everything looks great on the 551 and without the glossy screen of the samsung 8000 so far i have spent the entire night playing my favorite bd's on the vizio 551 and i gota say i am really knocked out  .
i is kinda thinkin i would wait and check out the vizio 552 with all the widgets and internet stuff , but then i got to thinkin , am i really going to use any of that stuff  .
perhaps not  .
i have a computer 10' away from my tv , if im watching a movie im watching a movie , not doing facebook or emails , , , beside's , i have a dvr and video on demand , and not to mention all the bd players that are out and coming out that all have those features as those features grow and change and expand i figure its alott cheaper to buy a new bd player than a new tv , , , that's another reason i figured it is a stupid idea (for me) to wait for the 552 anyhow , in closing i just gota say i am so very glad i decided to get the vizio 551 , for me , to my eye's and in my opinion the pq of the 551 blows away the 550  .
i gave them 4 stars only that while my tv is working it had a great almost 3d effect picture  .
there service is wanting  .
as half way thru the second day i still have not been able to acess thier fax machine still trying  .
just received this tv as ur first hdtv in the house and overall i am pleased with the performance  .
the picture is great on hd and blueray programming  .
pretty fuzzy/blury when viewing analog stations , but i guess that is expected  .
on the downside i is not able to program any of the other components we have to the vizio remote , which is disappointing , but we have other remotes  .
i have also been very disappointed on the audio level stability  .
this tv is rated very good on audio and the ability to keep the sound at one level (with the option turned on) , but this is not my experience with the tv , it seems to vary quite a bit between regular programming and commercials (we have directv)  .
overall a great hdtv , only disappointed in the audio hate having to turn the volume up and down all the time  .
need to fix that vizio .
over all i'm very pleased with this tv set  .
before i installed my directv hd dvr i is watching all my shows in standard def , and is quite surprised at how good it looked  .
now that i am on 1080p wow  .
i am planning on waiting until this comes out to buy a new tv  .
if the red bar is on it i will most likely not purchase  .
if anyone from vizio is reading this please save this tv  .
take the red bar off  .
everything i have read thus far is great about the tv except for the red bar  .
this could be something great  .

my neighbor has samsung ln55b650 (120 hz and not led)  .
her set looks better  .
the picture on her set has that deep black and saturated colors feel to it  .
we both viewed my set and thought it is not as good on hd , and way worse on sd  .
wii works fine on hers we both have charter cable  .
we both have hdtv receivers from charter , but different models , mine receiver is 2 years old not sure if an updated model would help  .
we both have hdmi cable from receiver to tv i am still not ruling out something on my side  .
i have my cable going to a splitter , so maybe a weak signal is the issue  .
i played with all the settings and improved the picture somewhat but still seems to be missing that crystal clear 3    d pop that i see in my neighbors set  .
i'll try plugging the coax directly in to the tv (i think charter does not encrypt local hd) and see if the picture improves (ruling out the receiver as an issue) updated  .
on jan 29 , 2010  .
pretty much just wait for a real led tv or the prices on the lcd backlit with led's comes down  .
check out the dropping prices on the vf550xvt not the same tv , i grant you , but the projections of may/june seem to have fallen by the wayside  .
good values to be had right now updated  .
on oct 11 , 2009  .
most features and benefits for the money  .
i watch a lot of sports and contemplated this set , the samsung 8000 series , and even a panasonic plasma  .
when costco knocked an additional $300 off , i could not justify the $1 , 200 price difference with the samsung  .
picture is phenominal , remote is easy to manipulate , and with my surround sound system , blue ray dvd's are awesome  .
i read dozens of customer and expert reviews and comparisons to the samsung and other than a few aesthetics , the reviews were pretty similar  .
also , costco gives an additional two year warranty  .
updated  .
on mar 21 , 2010  .
great quality on hd channels , poor quaility and a thin line at the top on standard channels  .
and poor response time on repair .
