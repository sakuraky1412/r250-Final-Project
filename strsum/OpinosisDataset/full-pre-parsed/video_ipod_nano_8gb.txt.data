i bought the 8, gig ipod nano that has the built, in video camera .

  itunes has an on, line store, where you may purchase and download music and videos which will install onto the ipod .

i have lots of music cd's and dvd's, so currently i'm just interested in storing some of my music and videos on the ipod so i can enjoy them on my vacation, and while at work .

there's a right way and wrong way to store music and videos onto the ipod .

 audio and video recording are a step above the competition .

 as always, the video screen is sharp and bright .

ipod nano even better with video camera !

 this time around, apple is branching out of its ipod formula in a small, but not insignificant way by gracing the back of the nano with its own video camera .

 still, video fans should consider stepping up to a product with a larger screen, such as the zune hd   or ipod touch .

the user interface of the 5g nano remains almost entirely unchanged with the exception of a few new menu items for the video camera, fm radio, and fitness features .

i can listen to it without headphones, i can record video .

 it looks nicer than my other one, love the video and everything else this one can do

 wish bb could engrave them too  announcer for songs is kind of annoying  haven't yet tried the video, but very pleased with the size and quality of my music on this nano .

 hard to delete videos from the nano device .

 the video design allow you to take different types of vidoe like x, ray, monochrome, and twist making it enjoyable to play .

 the video quality is actually fairly good, my friend toook a video with it and she uploaded it to facebook and it came out great !

 it eve ncame out better than a video she took with an actual camera camera !

 the video quality is perfect .

great for music, just ok for video

 video recorder only, cannot take just photos .

 the video, voice and pedometer recorder is one great addition to it .

 as for the video camera it's a nice addition considering it's an mp3 player first and foremost, i think people are going to go into this and think maybe i can replace my old video, no .

 it just a solid low quality video camera some of the lighting or your fingers may get in the way of the actual recording but once you get use to it, it can become fun .

 i find it weird that it will take video but not still pics .

 it looks just like the 4th generation, except on the back, there's a camera to take video clips or whatever it is you want to .

 i hate itunes, but it seems to be a necessary evil in order to tag say a video as music and not a movie, so though i originally started with 3rd party apps for syncing i have since switched to itunes .

this time around, apple is branching out of its ipod formula in a small, but not insignificant way by gracing the back of the nano with its own video camera .

 the video works very well for such a small sensor and it is so easy and convenient to use .

  we have had portable video players for our children as our cars are not equipped with these devices .

 video camera quality and sound are also surprising for such a small unit .

 not a tremendous surprise here, as we believed the sixth, generation  true video ipod  would not be announced until later in the year or even early in 2007 .

5g lies a more mature ipod, many steps wiser and more able than its one, year, old  the ipod gains many incremental improvements, including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing price points of $249 for the 30gb version and $349 for the huge 80gb version   .

 the 80gb is enticing for video addicts both for the capacity itunes movies are about 1 .

 the video camera is nice, just wish it could take stills .

 the one problem with the video camera is it is not the easiest thing to use .

 i also like that videos can be watched on it as well as listening to it without the ear phones that is a really great feature .

 the only odd thing is that is has a video camera but doesn't have a single shot camera .

 easy to use, video camera, radio, size, sound quality  .

 the battery doesn't last a long time especially when you're recording or watching a video but i just listen to music most of the time and it lasts me a good length of time doing that .

 the video quality is great and has different settings .

 definitely easier to use than the ipod touch, and the video camera feature is awesome .

 that way you will have enough storage to add music, video and pictures !

 i haven't found anything that is not so great  this is a multi use mp3 player with the ability to make videos, music and videos .

 great new features in this ipod generation include voice recording, listening to radio, and even filming video .

 has video camera and voice memo .

 the video looks great and it's easy to use .

 no  off  switch  compared to gen 4 the ability to listen without speakers and the video camera is great .

 as easy to use as any other ipod, and the video is good .

 she loves to make her own videos and play them back .

 the videos are so clear i just love it .

 however, the way it is designed, it is clumsy to hold while recording a video .

 camera does only video, not pictures  way better than 2nd gen nano .

 love the camera, but wish it had photo capabilities, rather than just video .

 it's got radio, video, camera, video camera, small  .

 love the pedometer feature on the nano and the video camea  .

 the color, the video, overall the item is great  .

 the size is very nice and compact and the videos are beautiful !

 it would be nice to delete songs when they get old  the video camera is the best, i use it all the time .

 it was fine quality sounds for  roof, raising  music and also insane levels of clearity for music videos or movies on the go !

 the video camera feature is awesome enough, but all of the special effects are incredible .

 he loves shooting video and then viewing it in  cyborg  mode or in sepia tones .

our 12 year old loves the ipod ,  especially the video camera feature .

 lots of features  i got this for my son because he wanted an mp3 player and a video camera for christmas .

 like the extra features ,  pedometer, video camera, radio, speakers .

haven't quite mastered the video camera yet, but i'm okay with that !

 movies, videos, music, music, music .

 plenty of memory to add all your favorte music and videos .

 the 16g holds a lot of music and video .

video, motion sensing, screen size and sllek look  i recently upgraded from the 2nd generation nano and love the new features of the newest model .

 can't believe the picture quality and ease of video use !

 it will take video, but not pictures  ?

 secondly, the thing has the capability to record video, but won't take pictures .

 yeah, that's typed correctly ,  video, but not pictures .

 seems kinda silly that they would go right to video and completely neglect photography .

 my daughter loves taking video, as well as the music & pics !

 she takes videos and pics with it all the time .

 i decided to get this ipod cause of the memory and the video cam in the back .

 the video camera and the graphics is so cool !

 easy to use and cool video camera !

 comes in different colors, make videos, and holds alot of music .

 small, holds lots of songs, video, easy to use  .

 can't figure out how to review the video clips i record .

  this is an easy to use item, but is slightly confusing to use when trying to review video clips .

 it takes video and has a really cool radio feature on it, according to the kids .

 easy to use, cool helpful features, video camera, voice over  .

 the video camera is great   and the different effects are fun to mess around with .

 it would be nice if the video camera zoomed in a little and if there was a regular camera as well, but those are pretty minor complaints .

  my daughter thinks that the video clarity is amazing and finds the built in speakers awesome .

 the camera and video feature are wonderful .

 holds tons of music, video, pics .

 i wish the video camera had a pause on it, but you can't pause .

 it can hold tons of music, video, pics and watching movies on the plane is nice .

 i also wish the video camera had a pause on it, but it doesn't pause and starts with a new video everytime you stop it .

 she didn't want the touch, she wanted the nano because you can video, it has the radio that she can play back the songs and she likes the size .

 the video camera is great and the screen size is a nice size

 we haven't tried the video yet, so i can't comment on that .

 great video quality, no ear buds required internal sound system sounds great  .

 still to new to we'll see  great product, video feature is awesome and i love how there is now internal sound and you don't have to use ear buds with it .

 don't really need video camera  eventhough we don't use the video that much the rest of the features are great .

 it does so many things,  wow, nav, video, mp3, and more !

 i love how easy it is to download from itunes and the fact i can also do video  .

 i am learning to navigate the menu better that at first and love that fact that i can take a video .

 its easy to use and love the new video feature .

 it does have some nice features such as the video camera and the radio .

 he has been using it consistently ever since and has nothing but praise for it and it's many options  loves the video cam and the music player recorder especially

 watching any videos drains the battery very quickly .

 glad you listen to the radio, play games and take video  .

 none of my old nano asseccories work with this one  fun new ipod, the video feature is fun but difficult to learn how to use .

 i've downloaded a lot of cds and music from itunes, also a few music videos,which are great fun to watch and hear .

 great for spot video if you do not have a camera availabe on hand .

 some changes such as video camera and bigger screean, but it was just ok .

great video camera and the funcionality is awesome

 video camera function and the blending of songs at the end and beginning  .

 nothing  the functionality and video camera were great innovations added to the newest generation of ipod !

 it's very easy to use and its video camera is very nice and it doesn't ghost .

 and the video quality is very good, and the sound quality is very good as well .

 sound quality, video quality, easy to use, space, customizable  .

 the colors are awesome, the sound is great and it hold tons of songs and videos !

 it has great video quality for such a small device .

 the video recorder, sound, look  .

 has bigger screen, video camera  .

 the picture for the video is awesome its very clear and easy to see .

 features, look and feel, video  .

 video, even in low light, is impressive .

 even the built, in video camera is very good .

 i'm really disappointed that apple is so proprietary that you can't use anything but itunes to add music and videos to an ipod .

 it has a built in video camera, and it shoots in high quality, which i was surprised at .

 n you can put music videos pictures .

 the video camera is cool, but i don't know that i would use it much .

 this can record videos and it is also very very light weight !

 i couldnt think of a single thing  this ipod is reallly great you can shoot videos listen to the radio plus you have 16 gigs of memory it is aweosme i really love it because its still as small as the last one only with a bigger screen and great color

 the video and external speaker components were a surprise on the 5th gen ipod .

 i love the video camera it has on it, the pedometor is awesome to use and best of all i can listen to music on it when i'm doing other stuff on my computer when it might be slowed down when listening to music on it .

 awesome features fm radio, video camara, pedometer and more  .

 nothing  what will apple think of next for their nano, the video camara records awesome video even in dim lighting .

 all the neat little features and surprisingly good video camera !

 i took it to class and decided to test it out and everyone was surprised by how good the video quality was .

 i'm planning on hiking half, dome next year and this is much much more lightweight than the video camera i have so it will definitely be accompanying me !

 fm radio lots of storage for music, videos and pictures alarm clock to your tunes blue color lock button so you don't accidentally turn it off on ease of use cons :

 hard to get videos onto computer  this was a purchase i made after i returned my sony walkman .

 a must, buy for everybody who loves music and video .

 video camera built in and music plays without head phones  .

 need a video program on your computer to obtain video  great product for the price .

 i had the ipod video but it did not work with my new nike

 chip so i bought the newest ipod video the day it came out .

 i cannot figure out how to get the video i record off of the ipod .

 ,  i cannot figure out how to get the video i recorded on my nano off to upload it to facebook or you tube .

shoes if using vid cam for long time, it kills battery  standard def video recording, but still sharp !

 only things i wish they added is measuring distance [not just steps] on the pedometer, better sound on the speaker, and a  capturing still images  with the video recording feature .

 the video recording feature is the best part .

7 out of 10 have not used video yet but the pixels would be just the same .

 the product is very useful if you want to go out for a jog and listen to your music or watch some videos if you stuck on a bus or subway .

 video camera, fm turner, speaker, pedometer  .

 location of the video camera, and the gap between the click wheel and ipod  the best ipod ever and has the best features ever .

 easy to use video camera, big screen, fun color  .

 which i am sure all nano's are like that  lol the video camera is so much fun !

 new look, shape and video cam feature  .

 smudgy finger prints  i like the video voice over color, purple i like hearing the ipod w out the ear plugs .

 light weight, radio, video camera  .

 i have an old 60gb ipod video that i use in my car and now i use this ipod for walking around campus and such .

 the video camera is a great feature to have, however its not that high of a quality when you transfer it onto your computer .

 camera has great video effects   .

 the videos you record do not show up on itunes though, you have to go to my computer and find the ipod drive, then open the folder named dcim, and the video files are in  .

 when you're not in a game or watching a video, if you turn it on the side, coverflow displays, however you can turn this feature off .

 i mean i do have my cell that takes pics and videos but i just love the picture video the nano records .

 and i just foundout you don't need the head phones in the ipod to listen to your music or videos !

 video camera with fun special effects, fm radio  .

 the glossy fingerprint attracting finish compared to last year's beautiful matte finish  great improvements with the video camera, really fun special effects, easy to use ,  also great fm radio with pause feature .

then it would be perfect oh and make a 32 or 64gb version so i can fit all my music and have lots of room for video ,  thanks !

 but overall i love it ,  between the radio, speaker, microphone, video camera, effects, there are enough new features to justify buying a new nano .

it's great to have a decent video camera with you at all times if you don't have an iphone .

 had the original itouch but i was burglarized andwas waiting for the itouch with video but can't wait any longer .

 video is impressive, speaker sound is good for size, easy menus, screen is big enough to watch movies .

 the videos are very crisp and clean, the video camera is nice, i was very surprised with the quality .

 small size and color, gettin your money's worth, nice screen, and video camera  .

 i do like the video camera on it .

 the mic and camera are great, speaker is great for video playback or bedtime movie watching, the screen is now even bigger and the device is the same size but lighter than the 4th gen nano !

 the video recording quality, price, size, weight, radio, pedometer, voice over  .

 video camera, radio, great price for a 16 gig, not a fingerprint magnet, small .

 cant take pictures just videos, and u need the headphones given for the radio  good for just listening to music and for your car .

 easy to set up, has a video camera and a radio built in .

 the video camera is not as good as i thought it was going to be .

 nothing  ipod nano has a video camera it is so cool, rock

 the video is very clear, the built in speaker is pretty good, the radio is very useful and overall it's just great !

 he was delighted as it had a video and camera which his original one did not have .

 it has plenty of room for her music and she loves taking pictures and making short videos with it .

 while the nano allows for video and audio, the ipod touch has interactivity and

 while the nano allows for video and audio, the ipod touch has interactivity and

its really good up to apples usual standard sound quality and video quality is brillant and is ideal for anyone !

the video camera feature is nice but i don't understand why they didn't allow for picture taking ?

 it's small and lightweight, it looks amazing, the video quality is way better than i ever imagined it would be, and the screen is huge .

the seller advertised it as the newest model which should be able to take pictures and video .

it is of the best buys i've done, sound quality, video and radio is excellent

 great sound quality, love the video recording too  :

 it's just a shame it only takes video and not still photos .

 it has a cool video recorder, but i could've done without it .

 the video camera works great and the battery

 if you had other ipods with the feauture of puting videos, when you synch them, they don't appear

 video option is easy to use .

 i have the 5th gen ipod video, and this thing blows it away !

the video is surprisingly good !

 i do wish that it also took pictures as well as video though .

so, the only thing about the ipod nano that i don't like   is the placement of the video camera .

 video quality is better than i expected .

amazing amount of music photos videos can be stored .

 video taking feature is interesting .

 it plays music, videos, radio, records

 the video capability is incredible, and so easy to use .

my wife and i are really pleased with our nano ipods that we purchased from you so easy to use and good to have a camera as well as a video john coleman

 it's a nice little gadget, i've put some songs on it and the video camera is good

 the video camera is crystal clear and the memory space is more than ideal for all your needs .
