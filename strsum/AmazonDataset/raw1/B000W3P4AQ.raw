i cook only once in a blue moon.  i was shocked to see with as little use as this range has had that the grates look like they were under heavy use for years!!!  i called Jenn air and spoke with Adam A.  and they wouldn't exchange them or fix them.  they only offered my 25% off ( which was the same price anyway from the internet).  i can't really compare much else on the range since i haven't used it much and i am  not much of a cook!  the stainless steel does tend to rust and stain.  i got a stainless steel fridge and dishwasher  at the same time  by other brands and those seem to not have the same stainless steel issues.
