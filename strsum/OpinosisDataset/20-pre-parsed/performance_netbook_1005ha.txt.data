performance reduction here is much less than superpi would suggest .

in super performance mode cpu, z shows the bus speed to increase up to 169 .

it enhances performance, but is not absolutely necessary because this unit is a full featured machine .

no noticeable performance reduction

performance is good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous usb ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .

battery performance couldn't be more nice, as well as performance .

0 out of 5 stars excellant portability and performance, august 14, 2009

faster overall performance, and shorter charge life on the battery .

very acceptable performance for what netbooks are designed to do .

the wireless performance is great .

0 out of 5 stars good ergonomics, exceptional battery, performance meets expectations .

it freaked me out since i wasn't running anything high performance .

1 light weight, 2 long battery life, and 3 reasonable performance .

otherwise its performance has been bug, free and met all expectations .

i expect to get 6, 7 hours in high performance mode .

the eee super hybrid engine utility lets users overclock or underclock their eee pc's to boost performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements .

i have the super hybrid engine set to auto mode, which i'm guessing is less than high or super performance   .

overall though, i am happy with the performance .

asus' center of excellance is in very reliable, very stable, high performance circuitry, mainly motherboards .

comes with unusually well, written documentation, though i'm still a little fuzzy on the different power, saving performance modes :
