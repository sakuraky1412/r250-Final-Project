room 610 is a `` penthouse '' large room with sitting area and with a terrace that maybe you are n't supposed to be on ( because it is really the hotel roof and we could n't tell ) , but the sliding doors in the room open onto it and you can almost touch the palais des papes which is feet away .
room is large with nice amenities like free beverages in the fridge , a nespresso machine and capsules , separate wc from the shower/ sink , both of which are off a little foyer where you enter ( we are so sick of hotels . . .
reserve the `` privilege '' room 610 if you have a little money for a splurge in a mid-range hotel or if you usually stay in 5-star hotels and want to save a little but still be comfortable .
however , getting back to the hotel with the car to pack up your bags is n't convenient and is a sort of round about pain to drive .
here , with the privilege room 610 , you get the best room in this hotel for €145-18o -- at least in shoulder season of may .
if money is no object , the mirande or hotel d'europe are top drawer , but they 'll run €400 and much further up .
check in , and the staff will draw a route on a map directing you to a public lot beneath the plaza .
best you just drag your luggage to 20 meters to the garage foot traffic entrance and just load up in the garage itself .
the hotel validates your ticket and you get a discount at the garage when you retrieve your car .
once you park , you exit the garage about 20 meters from the hotel entrance .
