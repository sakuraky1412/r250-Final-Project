as a mom with three little kids , this camera is my best friend  .

i never miss a shot  .

this camera has no delay when taking pictures , and the pictures are amazing quality  .

when i started taking pictures of my kids up close (about two feet away) , i noticed the camera is having trouble focusing , but when i turned on the macro mode , it focused perfectly so try that if you run into trouble  .

the macro mode is amazing on this camera  .

it has a macro mode , and a super macro mode  .

both take incredible close up shots  .

this camera is larger than your average compact point    and    shoot , but much smaller than a dslr  .

i bought a finepix camera case from ebay , and i have no trouble taking it with me everywhere  .

i usually drop it down into my diaper bag there are much more advanced cameras out on the market today with hd video and face detection and blink/smile features if you need all those bells and whistles this camera is not for you  .

if you're a mom , and all you need is a great quality camera that's point    and    shoot at a decent price , then this camera is definitely for you  .

i bought mine on ebay in march 2009 for less than $100  .

i've had seven different digital cameras in the past five years because i'm so picky and i'm never happy , but when i got this camera it is love at first sight  .

i'm completely satisfied with it and i know you will be too  .

i definatly recommend this camera both as a photographer and as father with kids always moving  .

havnt had any blurred shots so far and can even catch water droplets from rain very clearly .

this is my fourth digital camera  .

i dropped my canon powershot s2 (5mp) and while fixable , it seemed better to buy this fuji (7mp) at walmart on closeout (newer fuji had just come out) for $120  .

i'm glad i did , while i loved the canon i liked the fuji , but at first didn't like it as much  .

but i've grown to love the fuji , it works as a point and shoot really well  .

the 7 megapixel shots are so much better/larger (for cropping) than the canon  .

i wrote this review as some of the negative reviews of this camera are due to people who don't read the manual  .

the camera has a bias toward using it's high iso instead for blasting the flash  .

i have a panasonic that blasts the flash at low iso settings , you get nice pictures of the people , but the background is black (due to the low iso)  .

with the fuji you get a slightly grainy picture , but you get the people and background  .

often you cannot tell that the flash even fired from looking at the photo (you can always tell with the panasonic)  .

i can force the fuji to do what the panasonic does in p mode , or manual  .

but i've come to like the more complete coverage of the fuji in auto mode for $120 this is an amazing camera , i mainly take pictures of cars at car shows (thousands of them) and the fuji pictures are awsome outside in sunlight  .

the auto mode uses a low iso for smooth pictures of paint jobs (if you use flash it will automaticly go to iso 800 , this makes for grainy pics)  .

so read the manual , and get to understand the camera i've shot over 300 pictures in a day and i've never changed the batteries  .

i fully charge two sets of nicad's before i go and i've never put in the second set  .

i even carry a set of alkilines as plan c for batteries (as my canon would use two sets in a day of shooting) another feature is the lens cap , canon owners constantly complain about the cap , the fuji lens doesn't extend , so the cap fits firmly  .

also the lens doesn't move , no opportunities for dust or water to get into the mechanism  .

so i think this fuji will last a long time due to this  .

also i believe that the fuji would have survived the fall that killed my canon , it fell on the extended lens from knee height while shooting a picture of a motorcycle  .

afterwards the lens looked like the leaning tower of piza  .

the fuji design may have survived that fall , but that is just a guess you can still find this camera under $160 , so for that money you get an slr look and great pictures in auto mode  .

i have read the manual so i understand the limitations of the auto mode  .

however i seldom used p mode , and have not really ever used the manual mode  .

you can limit how high the iso goes (auto 400 mode) however this will darken the pictures , or increase the flash  .

since i view the photo's on a computer and rarely print , my trick for 'grainy pictures is make them one half the size , they are still bigger than the computer screen , but when you make them smaller the grainyness is minimized when looking at them full size (yes i know they are /2 size)  .

they never look grainy on the computer , only when viewing a piece of the picture on the screen , or a really small crop of a large photo  .

if you shoot outside in the sun you will be amazed the detail  .

combined with the optical zoom you'll be amazed i seldom use the video , but it seems to work fine  .

like my canon the zoom is useable with the zoom , which is nice  .

no stereo sound (canon had it) , but at $120 vs  .

$350 for a canon s5is i've gotten along just fine without it  .

with the $230 i saved i can now go get a fuji 10 mp camera , and still have the s    700 as a backup  .

however i am thinking about the canon sx10 at $399 , but that discussion is for another forum .

just got s700 3 days ago  .

it take excellent  .

pictures in all modes  .

would recommend this  .

camera to anyone .

despite the expected digital noise you find when zoomed in on your picture , the s700 is a wonderful camera  .

with 10x optical zoom , it reaches even the farthest points  .

with no lag in the evf or lcd , thanks to the 60fps technology , you know what you're shooting exactly when you shoot it  .

fujifilm's s700 also offers video mode in both 60fps (320x240) and 30fps (640x480) with accompanying audio  .

one important factor within the camera is the ability to choose a scene  .

this option allows the camera to make the necessary adjustments for you according to the preset scene  .

one scene you will be sure to use is flower  .

flower allows you to shoot in macro mode  .

macro mode is also available in auto as is super macro mode  .

super macro allows you to come within 1 cm of the object and still maintain focus  .

overall , this camera is one marvelous little point and shoot  .

digital noise aside , the only thing that could be better would be a manual focus ring  .

anyone wanting professional looking photographs and numerous options need look no further  .

you've struck gold .

perhaps not as great as a typical slr , but the fujifilm finepix s700 certainly throws compact digital camera's in the dust  .

this is the best digital camera i have ever owned the stability control allows for hand movement and still produces a clear , crisp , perfect picture  .

i highly recommend this camera .

buy it if you are interested in photography and would like to learn more to become a professional , or even if you want to just shoot good pics  .

my second camera , all most the best one ever  .

sorry for the bad grammar  .

imho , this is a great camera , we take alot of in motion pictures and it works perfectly we also shoot many nature pictures and they are by far the best we have taken  .

we upgraded from a hp to the s700 and are very glad we did  .

the camera so far has paid for its self thru ease of use and outstanding picture quality a friend of ours has a high end nikon ( she paid over $1200) and it takes just as good pictures as hers , she is very impressed with it .

i love this camera and in exactly one year i have taken 2500 photos with this camera  .

if youre looking for a digital slr and dont want to pay the price , this is your camera  .

i sold consumer electronics for a major retail store for 3 years and this is the best camera i found for the price  .

one year ago i paid $230 for it  .

it is worth every penny  .

read this  .

purchasing a new camera will not make better pictures  .

you can take good pictures on a 35mm 20 year old camera  .

the fact of the matter is not megapixels  .

6mp's is the same as a 35mm camera  .

the s700/ s5700 (europe) is 7  .

1 mega pixels , more than enough for an 11 x 18 photo , which i print all the time do not use the finepix software  .

it is slow and complicated  .

there is no mac support for it use a sd card reader , (or at least purchase one) you will eventually loose the cable or it will break just like every other point and shoot camera  .

i reccomended this to every customer that bought a camera at my store  .

they are only $10    $14 at best buy or amazon back to the camera itself  .

sorry for the rant  .

steps off soap    box  .

the fujifilm s700 handels great long term photo shoots  .

if you are at the kids soccer game or photographing a weekend event , it never get uncomfortable the battery life however is a small issue  .

it does run through the batteries fairly quickly  .

this can be fixed by using the eye    viewer or having an extra set of 4 aa battries  .

i uesd three sets of batries over three days averaging 200+ photos a day and 10    15 3 minute movies again per day  .

so if this will be an every now and again camera you will not have any problem also , if you shoot in very low light frequently (night , dark/large rooms eg  .

) this may not be the camera for you it produces significant noise during night time with and with out flash at 1600iso which is the high setting bottom line    .

if you are going to buy this camera and leave it in auto mode , do not buy it , you can find a cheaper camera that is more portable that does the same thing the s700 will do in auto for 50    70 dollars less  .

however , if you want many options and are willing to learn a little bit about how to take a better picture , this is the one for you  .

read the manual , it has too many features that you will miss just jumping into it my next camera will be a nikon dslr d40 (the entry level dslr) that i will purchase for 600 plus 300 for a lens and 200 for accessories for a total of $1100 usd  .

i will still own the fujifilm s700 (s5700) for my running    out    the    door camera great camera josh wilson  .

i really love this camera  .

i bought it for my husband's birthday , but i use it frequently took it to the zoo for a school trip and got some really great shots of the animals  .

i am by no means a good photographer and i is impressed at how great all the pictures look  .

i is torn between thin camera and cannons s5 , and i am now convinced i made the right choice with this one  .

so easy to navigate controls , i love it .

i just upgraded digital cameras from an entry level point and shoot digital camera  .

this is a good choice for someone who does not want to spend huge cash on an slr  .

it feels like an slr but much lighter , somewhat easier to use  .

there are a ton of settings , and being a novice photographer i have had to look up what all that stuff means , but it helps you take better pictures .

having just spent two weeks on the road during which time i shot close to a thousand pictures , most out of the window of a truck flying down the highway 55    70 mph , kept 650 of those , and after review and editing have over 550 very nice images , many of which are of professional quality , i am very much impressed with this camera  .

all images were shot on auto setting as conditions varied to greatly in my travels to attempt manual setting every time  .

likewise took several low light shots that are great , and a number of macro shots that are excellent although the s700 does have a few minor flaws , overall this is one great camera for the money  .

priority in features that sold me on this camera is the optical zoom lens is completely sealed so no dust or dirt enters the camera body around the lens have not begun to explore all the features , but from what i've seen thus far , this one is much better than the c    net review leads you to believe  .

total package camera , memory card , carrying case , and rechargeable camera batteries came to less than $250 at walmart .

i like this camera  .

optical zoom is great , shutter lag is excellent , and picture quality is great .

this camera outperforms many more expensive models  .

it works great in all light conditions  .

the flash is very powerful  .

the battery life is awesome  .

the zoom is unbelievably powerful  .

it takes great photos of children , animals ; moving objects are no problem for this camera the only con of this camera is the door over the card slot does pop open some times when you are holding the camera  .

when it opens the camera immediately shuts down  .

that is a small problem in my opinion on an otherwise great camera  .

i bought a $200  .

00 camera and got a $300  .

00 camera instead  .

i did not expect to get a $500  .

00 one for the price  .

for any action shots , i still refer to my old cannon a    1  .

i bought it for the zoom and still quality  .

it is weak in some parts but good in others  .

this is a good camera  .

it is hard to getting used to using only the right hand to use the camera  .

using the left can block or lock the flash .

i have this camera for two weeks , already took over a hundered shots  .

this is very good camera for the price , i dont know what cnet is testing , i have canon a570is powershot sd850is  .

i do not see a diffrence between these and highly reated other cameras over fuji s700  .

buy this camera and you wont be dissapointed one last thing , gret battery life .

good all round camera , easy to use and advanced features and good video quality  .

i shot my first professional photo in 1963 , so i've had about all of them   pentex sp1000 , nikon ftn , fa , fm , olympus om1 , om2 , om10 , canon ae1 f85 , f95  .

i think i is probably one of the last to finally go digital  .

i started with a canon power shot a310 and later a nikon coolpix l10 to throw into my camera bag as back up and fun shootings when i really did not care  .

but they got me hooked on digital so i thought i'd try this fuji as a step up  .

it feels good to an old 35mm photog like me , the fact that it takes 4 aa batteries to keep going when you have batteries go too soon is a great plus  .

i have no problems with learning the controls , i had fits going from an old nikon with the speed control on the barrel to the upper right where most other camera manufactors put it  .

going from a film camera to this is a dream  .

i took it out of the box , went out side and fired off a few shots on auto  .

a neighbor and her daughter (fresh from playing in the dirt) came by and the little girl smiled up at me dirty face , missing baby teeth and all , i took her photo , the second one on this camera  .

i showed the result to her mother and she ordered copies on the spot  .

like any camera you go out and shoot it , grab all the photos you can until the thing is second nature to you , that's how us old timers shot great photos with less that great equiptment (in comparison to to day's cameras)  .

i feel this is a winner  .

once you really get to know this unit , you will impress your friends .

how in the world does cnet describe this camera with mediocre performance and frustrating design  .

i could not be happier with its performance and its ease of use , especially at this price point  .

it effortlessly gives me awesome results in both photos and videos  .

this camera uses either xd cards (not very common and about twice as expensive as sd) or sd cards  .

the manual , not surprisingly , encourages using xd , so that is what i am using  .

xd works great  .

i have not tested sd  .

the only negative thing i have to say about this camera is that the videos have low but noticeable sounds in the background  .

the manual states that these noises come from camera operation  .

i would not say that this ruins the videos , but i certainly would prefer not to have these noises , and i do find their presence strange , as there are plenty of cameras that do not have camera operation noises in the video  .

this is a great zoom camera for the price  .

battery life is supurb and i love the fact that i can still use a sd card in it  .

i get great pictures from it but it takes a little getting used to  .

(only downfall) i think this is a solid quality camera for it feals stable and i took it to the beach and it got soaked in a rain storm  .

it performed just like new the next time i used it , just a few hours later  .

i have wanted a digital video camera for some time , but the video quality on this camera is far what i expected from a still camera  .

you can watch it on a standard tv and it looks like a vhs video  .

plus , you can zoom in during video recording , something i have never been able to do with my last 3 cameras with video capability  .

i will put off my digital video camera search for a while  .

in my opinion , if you want a good zoom camera with good video capability also , at a very low price , this is the way to go .

for the above average photographer this is a really nice camera  .

the 10x zoom will get thoes long shots that you have been wanting to capture , and the easy menus will let you set the camera for any condition fast  .

read the manual  .

i have made some really nice 8x10 prints  .

the recharabel batteries last a long time  .

the camera takes 4 batteries and all i need to carry is one set in the camera and one extra in the bag  .

for the money , it is a great little camera  .

i have had this camera a week and what a camera i find it simple to use  .

and a choice replacement for my konica t2n  .

i used to have to carry around 30~35 lbs of gear and film now a handful of ni    mh and my 15 minute charger good to go a pocket full of 2 gig sd cards weighs less than 10 rolls of kodachrome or tri    x film and instant results  .

digital camera with a very nice sized lcd screen  .

my usb card reader allows me to access my photo's on any tower or laptop i find all the controls and active buttons easy to reach and use with my big clumsy paws i really enjoy the grip and weight of the camera the flash is pretty darn good , though i will be purchasing a slave i do enjoy the viewfinder and that i can make adjustments without taking my eye of the subject 46 mm screw thread is great  .

the plethora of filters in this size is a photographers dream  .

a uv to protect the front element is a must a green for beautiful b w skin tones and a red for that extra contrast and hardness for photo    journalism i like the control offered in both the shutter priority and manual modes i have used the museum mode  .

with the camera not firing the flash or making any noise is perfect for inside a cathedral at a wedding ceremony for 2 1/2 bills , this camera is a wonderful joy to carry and use .

come on cnet  .

give this camera more credit than you gave it , it's easy to handle imho , batteries do not drain as quick as most digitals , has more features than cameras costing twice as much  .

i might even buy a second one as back up  .

my pictures look better than my canon f1 35mm ever did .

i have now owned this camera for a few weeks and have taken all kinds of pictures  .

i am absolutely amazed  .

i love this camera  .

i did my grandson's baseball game and gave the pictures out on cd to all the players  .

they loved the pictures and wanted to know what kind of camera i is using  .

they thought to get those quality of shots the camera would of had to cost in $800    $1000 range  .

from super macro to far away and action shots so far it has done it all in great quality  .

i have an expensive slr and i prefer this camera  .

it is easy to hod in your hand without being clumsy  .

i would recommend this camera to anyone .

, here is the deal  .

i haven't purchased a new digital camera in about 8 years and i have been doing quite a bit of reading on other models out there  .

i had thought about the s6000fd , then the s5600 , just about every camera in the nikon d series and the canon rebels and it seems like no matter where i looked , just about every digital camera has its flaws  .

this was not helping my decision making  .

then i saw this camera on amazon for a little over two hundred bucks  .

i like the long zoom , the variety of scene modes , the fact that i have full manual control (when i actually learn to use it) and the fact that you can use 4aa batteries which is nice if you need to get up and shooting again quickly without spending the money on an expensive camera    specific rechargeable battery i also saw this camera as a way to learn how to take full manual shots playing around with lens speed , aperture , iso speed , etc , without throwing down $400 or more on a dslr , which i may or may not like i know that many of the point and shoots out there also offer full manual control , too , but i wanted something somewhat with the feel and look of a dslr i see myself as being in a position that lots of other people might also be in when they want something better  .

do you throw down the cash on something that might be a bit overwhelming and expensive (i  .

dslr) or do you go a step up from a basic point and shoot  .

out of the box , the camera takes decent indoor photos with the flash  .

indoors , without a flash , without appropriate light , the camera images show some pretty noticeable noise  .

for portraits of people indoors however , auto mode with a flash is fine outdoors , whether it is people , nature , buildings , houses , etc  .

is where this camera shines  .

macro images look awesome  .

i am taking shots of plants and flowers , without a tripod , using the super macro mode that look like they came out of a nature magazine  .

so that might be over    doing it but they look pretty darn good considering my lack of shooting experience i like this camera because you can really learn to use the manual settings on it in yes , as cnet says , a somewhat clunky or slow way  .

but for a person just learning how to dabble with manual settings , would find themselves pretty comfortable  .

yes , i have played around with several of the nikon d series cameras and to an amateur such as myself , i find them a bit daunting and a bit much to heft around for simple family shots or the occasional landscape shot  .

yeah , i know that the d40 and d50 are out there , and they are considerably smaller than the d70 and d80 , but they are way out of my budget i do not mind the menus this camera has as i play around with each of the shooting modes and i guess that i would rather have a menu to read then a small button and symbol to decipher on the back of my camera for each setting on the camera i want to change , as you would see on a full    size dslr  .

i see the s700 design as being an excellent model to train on before stepping up to the dslr  .

also , the price is pretty enticing although the s5600 and s6000fd will be dropping down to the price of the s700 as time goes on in terms of actual usage , if you are willing to learn to use the scene modes and pre    programmed modes , and not be afraid to venture away from the auto setting once in a while , this camera produces some pretty spectacular shots , not to mention the handiness of the zoom lens  .

i know that most dslr's right out of the box will take great shots while using auto mode but the fact that the s700 offers full manual control , a pretty simple interface and a price around $300 to $400 less than a dslr makes this camera an enticing option  .

i see this camera as one i can grow with as i learn to take better pictures as i eventually move on to a dslr .

this camera has everything that a novice to an intermediate would want  .

the image stabilaztion program is vey nice as well  .

it allow's you to take nice crisp pictures  .

with the 10x zoom , you are getting a bargin at the current price  .

just yesterday i shot well over 200 pictures without even a hiccup  .

the ease of use is very good as well as the layout on the camera itself  .

it is just a tad bulky but the picture quality i get is well worth the trade  .

i would encourage those who are looking for a good point and shoot to purchase this camera .

i like the ease of setup and mode changes  .

i have also found that if you connect to a a/v input you can view the image during the capture mode just like the lcd  .

i am looking to purchase a in/out video card so that i can do some photo shoots .

for the price you can not beat this camera period  .

the extras this camera has is equal to cameras i have priced costing $500 and i bought mine for less than $200 and now they sell them for around $100  .

i have bought 5 of these cameras for friends doing ebay and youtube videos you cannot beat it i promise  .

an absolutely fantastic point and shoot for the beginner  .

if you are more advanced then you should invest in something more in your range of expertise .

this is a very good camera to start out with , easy to use , lots of new features and functions compared to a point and shoot  .

very good price  .

i've owned it for half a year now and have had no problems whatsoever  .

it has a threaded lens which you can attach 46mm filters to .

i own this camera and everyone that does gave it a higher score than c    net's score of 6  .

what's up with that  .

it's a great camera and the price (under $200) is stupendous for what you get  .

picture quality is great  .

really great  .

true , it's slow in between shots but unless you are willing to shell out $500+ for a nikon , the other cameras in this price range aren't much faster and they don't offer same features and manual controls  .

i find the menu design highly intuitive so i don't agree with c    net's review  .

it has some really useful features       like using playback mode without turning camera completely on  .

it is solidly built and it's a pleasure to hold  .

do not even think twice       nothing comes close in this price range .

i have had this camera for some time now and i have taken great pictures that have won photography contests  .

you are able to notice a great difference in the pixels compared to most other cameras  .

it has brought me great joy in capturing the clear colors and beauty of our land and so many smiles .

only problem i have with this camera is the pop up flash sometimes when shooting , my finger gets in the way of the flash and as a result , i lose a good picture also , like other poorly designed cameras , theres no place to put your left hand to hold onto the camera the old slr cameras had better body designs i find that alkaline batteries lasted me almost 80    100 shots  .

not bad for a digital camera  .

i also find that when a picture is taken , the display shows a well exposed picture , but when downloading to the computer , they come out a little under exposed , which can lead to a darker picture the higher iso with manuel adjustments will give a better exposed picture the instruction manuel isnt too user friendly either , resulting in confusion when looking for certain needed information for the money , this is not a bad camera , but you have to learn how to deal wih these problems .

sorry cnet ,  .

look around the internet , and you'll soon see that cnet missed the mark on this one here whatever the reason (bad day) , they have a significantly different opinion than professional camera reviewers this camera produces pictures that compare to camera costing $150 more  .

though it does not have fuji's super ccd , it is a top quality , next generation ccd take advantage of my 15+ hours of research on digital cameras  .

information is only as good as it is current (see earth being flat) p  .

go to fuji usa and get the firmware update (1  .

01) that further improves function , and adds sdhc (high capacity memory cards 4gb and up) support .

love this camera  .

bought it as a second camera for a trip to italy  .

found that the battery life is twice as long as my wifes canon powershot and the pictures are as good as , if not better most of the time  .

thanks fuji  .

i could get 36 good shots on my old ae1 because i knew the camera with digital you can take hundreds and throw away most of them , which seems to be the way most people shoot , however , as with film the more you use it the digital the it's training of you begins to take effect and you find that more pics are acceptable while no one making a living would use this camera you could become a pretty good amateur at weddings and such if you understand it and have the ability to compose good shots you will have to stay away from action shots and multi    (burst) this camera meets my needs in that i think first    compose , and try to get stuff that needs little or no editing if you don't have the inclination to learn to use it's features you would not be happy with a $1000 dslr either look upon it as an art form and you can do wonders , otherwise , buy a really good $200  .

a type  .

photometry is what exposure systems are called  .

panasonic lumix  .

you've got to be kidding  .

sure , it looks good on paper , but as soon as you take a few photos you realize how awful the noise and distortion are , even at low iso  .

since the reviewer is obviously not a photographer she does not understand the concept of higher shutter speeds and higher lense opening numbers are used to decrease the exposure (hence the down arrow  .

the focus limiting range feature is similar to those found on expensive nikon and canon professional lenses to reduce the hunting range  .

it is not a gimmick yes , the s700 is slow and the slow shutter respone times especially in low light are definite drawbacks  .

when compared to the competition , though , the lens quality , the low image noise all the way up to iso 800 and beyond and the fantastic skin tone are amazing  .

sony and panasonic could learn a great deal from fuji about color and image processing  .

and it's time that cnet reviewers actually have some expertise in the products they review or just admit that they are reviewing .

i think this camera is excellent  .

it has really been working great for me  .

i especially like the super macro , because you can get incredibly fine detail , even when you are mere centimeters away  .

and the auto focus , it's not a huge problem , but most of the times , you will find that it is your mistake for leaving macro on or something like that  .

the noise is not to troublesome , and i almost always keep my iso low , because i have steady hands  .

so , overall , this is a great camera , for a great price , and it rivals cameras like the canon s3 , and i think it would be great for anybody .

i find this camera to be very good  .

i researched seven other comparable cameras before choosing this one [ finepix s700 , olympus stylus 780 , canon powershot a710 is , powershot s3 is , panasonic lumix dmc    f28 , sony cybershot dsc    h2 , and the nikon coolpix p5000 ]  .

i really liked the nikon , but the finepix s700 gave me everything that i wanted for a much cheaper price  .

this unit uses both the xd and sd memory card  .

continuous shooting is at 1  .

4 fps , iso is up to 1600 , picture stabilization is solid , and it is lightweight  .

shutter speed is at 1/1000 vs  .

1/2000 there is a dual shot mode that will take two consecutive pictures , with one press of the button  .

one will be without a flash , and the other will have a flash  .

you can then either keep them both or just the best one the iflash is awesome  .

the camera can sense the surrounding light , and will flash if necessary with only the intensity needed to get a great picture  .

the pictures are beautiful  .

if you only point and shoot , you will like 90% to 95% of your pictures i would say that this camera is at the low end of the scale with regards to price (from free up to $1 , 000) , and near the high end of the scale with regards to photography technology (powder flash up to u2 spy plane camera) .

i is looking at some canons recently (sd870 , sd1100 , sd1000) as an upgrade but after comparing their user experience with the ones of this fuji and my own experience , i think i'll just go for better rechargeable batteries stick with my fuji .

i went to the camera store to purchase a nikon l14 that i saw in christmas ad at a very good price  .

i like cameras that are simple , but at the same time , i like performance and great picture quality i have always liked nikon and canon because i think they have the best all around performance when i walked into the store , the finepix s700 is on display and it is being strongly pushed by the sales people  .

i have worked in sales for many years and i know that when something is being pushed by the sales team , it means one of two things or both ; either management is forcing them to push the camera because of its extremely high profit margin , or there is a very substantial commission to be earned by selling it  .

as far as i'm concerned , what a salesperson earns in commission is not an issue for me as long as i get great service , and leave the store with a great product i started asking questions about the s700 because the price is very inviting for a camera of this type body    style  .

(professional look) i asked the salesperson if i could take a look at it so that i could play with the controls  .

the camera actually felt better in my hands than i thought  .

since it looked like a professional style camera , i is expecting it to weigh quite a bit  .

wow , is i wrong  .

the camera's weight actually comes from the four aa batteries that it runs on  .

the s700 runs quietly while zooming the lens in and out  .

what really impressed me and helped me narrow down my buying decision is the fact that the lens is self    contained ; meaning it does not protrude in and out while zooming in and out , (as most cameras do the lcd screen is exceptional  .

it is 2  .

5 inches which renders its viewfinder useless  .

the pop    up flash is great except for the fact that you have to be sure to let another user know to keep their left index finger off the top of it while shooting because it will keep it from popping up i used the manual setting a few times , and they seem to really enhance my photos and correct a lot of amateur shooting mistakes  .

the problem is   this camera is far beyond point and shoot , so using the manual setting has a learning curve that is not so simple , but it can be fun to try to master shooting in daylight is awesome  .

the camera is virtually flawless when it comes to this  .

low light shooting leaves a bit to be desired  .

the average user will be quite satisfied with the low    light photos , but as they progress , their distinguishing eye will start to be more critical of the slight graininess that the photos contain  .

again , it's not a deal breaker , unless you are well beyond advanced photographer status the camera has two different color modes ; one is standard , which is pretty good  .

the other is chrome , which is more like a vivid setting on other cameras  .

the chrome settings saturates the photos quite a bit , so you may really want to experiment with this setting before going with it for extended periods of time the camera uses xd and sd cards which is convenient  .

i have not noticed a big difference , but i have been sticking with the sd format since i have other gadgets that use the same format overall , this is a great camera , and if i had to pick one flaw that makes me a bit uneasy ; i would have to say that it is the purple haze problem that i experience in very bright sunlight from time to time  .

i have learned to adjust my shooting angle to minimize it , but sometimes , the shooting situation does not allow this the fuji s700 is an awesome camera , and price    wise , it will have a strangle hold on the digital point    and    shoot market for the time being  .

it is definitely worth a shot (no pun intended) if you are an amateur or advanced photographer looking to get a little more experience before plopping down the big bucks for a camera that makes a living for you instead of you making a living for it .

this camera is not on par with some others in its class , although it is not a bad camera  .

taking photos of people from a short distance often produces images that are slightly exaggerated , and the flash need to be controlled or it will distort the colors in picture with washout  .

easy way to store shots is with a sd card , not included ; otherwise you will need to use the cord to download from internal storage i honestly do not think i would buy this camera again  .

i own one of these and i keep getting problems closing the battery lid , now it won't close completly , and the camera wo not work  .

can i get my money back please  .

this camera is a great first    time camera for an aspiring photographer  .

it takes amazing pictures with great color quality , and even though the learning curve is pretty steep , it's easy and fun to use once you master it however , my main issue with this camera is that my flash won't pop up anymore  .

i have barely owned it a year  .

i've read that a few other people have had this problem with the camera , and that it is not fixable  .

i just had to get creative and ball up some duct tape and wedge it under the flash which looks tacky and unprofessional the camera is also very heavy , and it is not very compact , so i do get pretty annoyed with carrying it around all day at big events  .

the user interface is pretty complicated , and the camera looks very intimidating because of all the buttons even though i enjoy the quality of its photographs and the functions , i probably would not recommend this camera to an aspiring photographer , simply because i know there are many other good cameras out there just like this one for an amateur aspiring photographer , i'd recommend a canon or nikon , because i just prefer the lens quality of those overall , it's an amazing lens stuck in a poorly designed body .

this is a point and shoot with a zoom  .

nothing more  .

pictures look fuzzy with the 10x optical zoom and 4x digital zoom  .

most look fuzzy in low light conditions without using the zoom on all iso settings  .

white balance is terrible if not deplorable pictures on all settings lose color  .

blues and purples look grey  .

the unit is cheap plastic and the battery housing is so cheap you feel in is going to break whenever you change batteries images become cropped  .

that is , the actual picture comes out far different than it originally looked in the viewfinder or on the 2  .

5 screen  .

the result is you lose a lot of what you intended to get in the picture now the good   red eye reduction is very good  .

the menu is easy to use , the price is cheap and the flash works well  .

really , i want to write more , but am at a loss for words i recommend people pony    up a few more dollars for a sony or a casio with the same features before buying this .

my husband and i jumped through hoops last summer to get ourselves this camera  .

it looked good , had lots of options and decent reviews  .

well i nearly cried when i saw the quality of the photos it took  .

my 4 year old canon powershot 3 mega    pixel camera kicks the fuji finepix s700's butt  .

if you still want to buy it you can find mine on ebay  .

my camera broke in less than a month  .

it is a poorly designed piece of junk .

this camera takes fairly nice pictures outdoors , but unless you manually set the lens speed , etc  .

, it takes absolutely terrible pictures indoors  .

they are all too grainy or too blurry  .

please stay away from this camera  .

we have been horribly disappointed .

i have bought fugi cameras all of my adult life and have never had one complaint til now  .

i am very disappointed to find out that they will not stand behind thier name on this camera , it has not been used much and in mint condition with no damage  .

it is not possible for anyone to damage the battery circuit , that is a malfunction on their part .
