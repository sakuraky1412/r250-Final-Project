this is a great location , when we visit bangkok we always stay on silom road as we find it really convenient for everything .
this hotel is really great - we had an executive suite which was pretty huge - a big living area with study area in one corner , a separate bedroom with huge en suite and a further separate toilet off the living room .
the value for money is excellent as you can regularly book these suites for under £100 a night which is great .
one of the fantastic things about south east asia is that , generally you can stay in absolute luxury for a fraction of what you would pay in the uk .
i have never had to pay over £100 a night for 5 star hotels in bankgkok .
anyway , back to this hotel - the bar and restaurant which i think are on the 37th floor is really lovely - with seating both inside and out .
mt partner said that i had to mention their pad thai . . . . .
it was the best has had during our entire 2 week trip ! ! ! . . . . .
one other thing before i sign off - with the rooms - there are 2 very different styles that you can book - one is a more traditional look with lots of wood ( which we had ) . . . . . .
and a more loft apartment style with a lot of white and painted bricks etc .
hopefully this should please most tastes .
we would recommend this . . .
