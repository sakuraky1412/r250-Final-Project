Summary:. I bought this while out of town for MY wedding when my Sony TVR-11 died. I didn't have time to do my homework and trusted the bib box retail salesman who said it was a great replacement for my TVR. I found out later that my TVR had TWICE the video quality and didnt break until after four years. This piece of garbage DVD-101 broke after 6 hours and right before my wedding! (We didn't buy the out rageously priced extended warranty.) The store swapped it out with another one and it has now broke. A different problem this time. The first was a jammed disc door and this one's toggle switch that controls EVERYTHING has stopped working. The camera was never abused and rarely used. STAY AWAY from the DVD-101!!! I saw one in the store yesterday and went ahead and let the salesman make his pitch. He was clueless as he went on about how great it was. BTW: Anybody wanna buy a DVD-DOOR STOP?. 

$$;
Pros:. It records on DVD!. 
Cons:. Buy the Hitachi they are on there like 4th generation model, It has better specs and takes still images to DVD disc or SD cards..
