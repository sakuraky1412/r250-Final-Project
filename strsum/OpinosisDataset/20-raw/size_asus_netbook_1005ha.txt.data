0 out of 5 stars PERFECT SIZE NETBOOK, September 23, 2009
His full sized laptop dies after about 2 hours of use .
Smaller size videos   play even smoother .
Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .
The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .
If I were looking to get work done quickly, I would pay the extra money to go full, sized, even if it's slower .
The screen size works just fine for me .
It's 90% size keyboard doesn't take too long to get used to .
Surprisingly readable screen for the size .
The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .
Someone else suggested going to the store first to check out the size .
Like how they made keyboard as large as possible unlike Qosmio 17  which is almost same size .
The power adapter is a nice small size
Some reviewers have complained about the physical size of the battery extrusion from the bottom of the netbook .
Ended up with this one based on smaller size, lighter weight and the overwhelming number of positive reviews .
,  don't know why they use the screen size most do ,  1024 x 600 seems cramped
Light weight and small size ,  This was highly important during my travels .
The overall size seems right on target, small enough to easily travel, but large enough to be usable .
It runs quietly and operates Windows efficiently, staying incredibly cool compared to the instant burn, your, lap sauna of my full, sized HP Pavillion .
This netbook is just the right size, great for travel and the 10 .
