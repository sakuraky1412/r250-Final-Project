during a recent trip to the alton area , i needed a hotel for a night .
i found this hotel on the motel 6 website , but could n't book it either on the website or on the national reservations number due to a system outage .
this was not an issue to the desk clerk who got me the room with no problems .
the rooms are the newer `` refreshed '' motel 6 rooms , with the faux wood floors and the flat screen television , which was clear to see and had many channels .
all of the other amenities in the room worked as they should and i did not see any insects or anything out of the ordinary .
now to the staff : the staff members i encountered were nothing short of friendly .
they always had smiles on their faces , and were very helpful when my friend had a medical emergency , calling 911 to get ems to the hotel .
when so checked out on sunday morning , the manager bud showed great concern and the first words out of his mouth to my friend were `` how are you feeling ?
'' there are several places to eat in the general area and more within a 29 minute drive of the hotel .
however , it should be noted that gps will send you more than a block away from their entrance ; their entrance is right where the small sign is .
if you 're looking for a luxury hotel with 300 count linen . . .

if you 're looking for a reasonable place to stay for a night or two , and want excellent customer service , you will enjoy this hotel .
