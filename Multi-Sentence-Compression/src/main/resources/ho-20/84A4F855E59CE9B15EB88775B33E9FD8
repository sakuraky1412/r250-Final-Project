as a platinum for life starwood member , a fairmonth platinum and gold hilton ( probably diamond this year ) , i have seen the best and the worst hotels have to offer and let me tell you this is by far and away one of the best !
marc trully has a gift in social interaction and this hotel is so very lucky to have him as i am certain many guests come back because of his contribution the theri stay. .
he cam over to me and i then recognized him ( from a previous stay ) as marc bauman , executive manager of the hotel .
while awaiting check in , i noticed a man in a black suit walking around and greeting everyone with a sincere desire to ensure the guests were absolutely taken care of and having a good time .
on check in , i was greeted by sarah and amanda , both outstanding , friendly and very helpful indivuals backed by a team of others at the front desk equally as impressive .
to have a senior manager out and about greeeting guests and with the professionalism and sincerity most frequent travels all too often do n't see , was such a pleasent surprise .
it trully is heaven on earth and i ca n't wait to go back .
the caprese omellet is to die for and with servers like paul taken caer of your every wish . . .
they sharp , recognize that you want top get to your room asap and magically transform an otherwise mundane check in experience to a very warm and welcoming one .
the property is stunning , the facilities very high end , the food absolutely first class but what really kick this place up to the `` excellence '' class is the staff .
i can go on and on but trust me when i say . . .
i know it does for me !
you just got ta try this place and live the dream .
it makes the day start off with such a great feeling .
oh wait , i 'm going back next week . . .
have i said enough ?
what a touch of class .
see you pool side !
breakfast at terrazzo is amazing .
yayyyyyy ! ! ! ! !
