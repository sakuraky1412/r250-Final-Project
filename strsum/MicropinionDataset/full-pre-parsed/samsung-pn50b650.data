i is able to find this plasma for $934 at frys electornics before christmas '09  .

their everyday price is $1400  .

if you are in the market for a large flat panel television that has tons of great features , excellent picture quality , and won't break the bank , look no further  .

i have not noticed a big problem with glare either  .

it is in a fairly well lit room with two big picture windows , and i only close the blinds on the closest one at certain points in the day  .

i have the same issue with my lcd in the other room  .

don't be fooled by all the gimmicky catch phrases like 240hz and 80 , 000 mp dynamic contrast with the lcd/led tvs  .

plasmas are 600hz and 2 , 000 , 000 megapixels dymanic contrast by default  .

and the average cost difference in power usage is $1 a month  .

woopdeedoo  .

$12 a year  .

as an added bonus , if you have certain types of samsung cellphones , you can send messages directly to the tv  .

do not ask me how it works , but that is pretty sweet  .

this is an exceptionally well designed tv and the price is exceptional  .

people tend to forget about plasmas  .

they have the best picture quality available right now  .

led still suffers from ghosting and motion blur which are incredibly distracting  .

this plasma has a very natural look and movies look exactly how they should in the theater especially with 24p on blu    ray (no artifical plastic looking images and artificial frame rate bumping)  .

another plus is you can get this for very cheap compared to others  .

i got this for less then 1000  .

you cannot find any comparable tv across any brand for that amount including samsungs own lcd models  .

i own a 42 inch plasma tv from samsung from year 2006  .

this 50 inch plasma is lighter , better quality , and uses less energy and produces less heat  .

my old tv had some burn in in the first 100    200 hours but it seems more prone to it  .

this plasma gets rid of it quickly and it doesn't stay around very long  .

additionally , my 42 inch had a buzz that is significantly louder then this 50  .

yes this tv is almost 10 inches bigger and it weighs less and it's quieter  .

it's also thinner  .

this looks great on the wall  .

it's just a bit thicker then the pn50b850 series  .

it's thinner then lcd tvs (exception of led's) i play games , watch movies , and watch tv  .

i do it all  .

i do not have any fear of image retention  .

they reccomend you take it easy in the first 400 hours of life  .

i did this by watching the static images and change channel every now and then on 4  3 ratio programming  .

i hardly went easy on the set though i'd reccomend this tv to anyone that wants true blacks , no motion blur , and a very versatile set for the money  .

it's the best bang for your buck right now  .

i've owned a 50 panasonic plasma since 2005 , it is cnet's editors choice  .

gave it to my son  .

i wanted to check out the 1080p , cinema smooth , internet widgets and i was not disappointed i've been building computers since 1988 and i do my homework when it comes to electronics and attention to detail  .

i've read all the reviews by customers , cnet , consumer report on all three brands  .

they all have their issues , but in my opinion , samsung wins out in every respect and for the money , panasonic does not have a chance first issue i want to address is buzzing  .

no buzzing at all  .

once again , no buzzing at all  .

i know samsung addresses the issue on their website , but it's a non    issue  .

if you put your ear to the top of the vent , you can hear the fan  .

the folks who have complained about the loud buzzing , you need to return the unit for another , you have a lemon  .

but if you check , there are a heck of a lot of people with not issue compared to those who have now to another issue , burn    in  .

the first thing you do with any plasma set is turn down the contrast  .

no matter what mode you select the contrast is in the 90s  .

i cut the contrast down to 45/55 , brightness 55/65 , color 45 , and turn on burn protection  .

you can brings those up as hours accumalate  .

the other tweaks to your liking  .

after the burn    in period , knock yourself out  .

the cinema smooth 1080p/24 , no glitches i have noticed  .

blu    ray is outstanding and sd is very good  .

the internet feature works great with plenty of widgets , etc  .

what you do need , unless you hardwire is the samsung wis    08bg2x wireless link stick , plug it in the usb port on the side , go to the internet option , select wireless , type in the wep id off your modem and your are ready to surf  .

but if you are looking for some serious surfing , use your computer/laptop  .

believe me , you will love this plasma  .

hope this helps in your decision , take care .

i don't mind that they chose to give the frame a touch of color with the red tint , but i wish they didnt need to tint the screen itself  .

this doesnt really effect the colors when watching tv but you can definitely notice it during the day in the reflections  .

daytime viewing can be difficult if you do not darken the room  .

i got a great deal on this set , sub 1k tag w/ free delivery so i cant complain too much  .

i expect the tv to last me 10    15 years until i decide to jump into a more affordable led backlit lcd or possibly oled .

i compared this tv side by side with the tc    p50g10 and there is no doubt the samsung is superior  .

it is less expensive , delivered better colors , and i thought it's black were darker  .

i'll admit i is concerned with all the talk about buzzing , but i haven't heard a thing  .

save yourselves some money , skip over the skinny 850's and the panisonics and buy a 650 you wo not be sorry .

after looking for months for a 50 + tv i went plasma and chose the samsung pn50b650  .

picture quality is outstanding  .

great for sports and gaming  .

lots of display options allow you to set it up for different lighting scenarios there can be a slight glare during some scenes but it's not to bad  .

the sound is ok  .

i use 5  .

1 so it's not a problem  .

i do not hear any buzz coming from mine like i read in other reviews  .

i havent seen any burn    in or image retention watching espn networks for hours upon hours for the price this tv is outstanding  .

picked up at best buy for a little over $1000  .

it is as cheap as the pn50b550 that day .

i only wi .
