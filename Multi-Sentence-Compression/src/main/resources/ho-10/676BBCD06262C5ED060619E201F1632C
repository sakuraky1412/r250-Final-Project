the riad is at the end of a maze of alleyways , as are a lot of the riads but , with instructions from the owner , you soon learn to find your way back .
the only negative point here is that although the riad has a beautiful calm atmosphere , this is somewhat disturbed momentarily at around 6am in the morning when the nearby mosque blasts out itâ€™s call to prayer .
dominique arranged for a man with a cart to collect our luggage in the morning who took the cases to a waiting taxi at the end of the alley , which took us to the airport .
if you were staying for a week , you would probably be better with one of the other rooms .
the bathroom was clean and modern with a large , walk-in shower , however , no shower door , so be careful not to flood the bathroom .
it is located very close to the main sights in the city , which are all very walkable .
there was a delightful roof terrace with table , chairs and loungers and views over the rooftops of surrounding area .
our room was on the ground floor and was very roomy and comfortable however , not much room for hanging your clothes .
it is very stylish and tastefully furnished and has an air of calm in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the medina .
this is a very elegant riad and the service is great .
