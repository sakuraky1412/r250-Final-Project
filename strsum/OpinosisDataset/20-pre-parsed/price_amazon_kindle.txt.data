books are retardedly pricey .

lower overall price, with nice leather cover .

should have been priced at $250  .

4 delivery and prices for austrian user

non, best seller book prices should be lower, just like some magazine subscriptions are .

of course they won't be priced at $9 .

disappointing given the prices .

books are priced in us$ for oversea consumers .

savings trump purchase price with kindle's low book price advantages .

one, for what you get it is over priced .

the subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .

of the 20, several were priced higher on b&n then amazon, significantly so, while 5 were not available on b&n at all .

it was obviously out of my price range .

if amazon reduces their prices back to the $9 .

konrath are offering novels at prices ranging from $1 to $2 dollars, as a way to find new readers .

99 price and credits those who've paid more, i'll once again recommend kindle .

i did see a few big price differences eg .

the price, tag for this item is quite steep when you first look at it .

as to price, i usually purchase books on a weekly basis .

amazons book are priced significantly lower and easier to find in my opinion .
