well/RB ,/, this/DT particular/JJ embassy/NN suites/NNS was/VBD not/RB near/IN a/DT highway/NN as/IN most/JJS of/IN them/PRP are/VBP ,/, so/RB i/FW could/MD escape/VB to/TO my/PRP$ bedroom/NN to/TO eliminate/VB the/DT noise/NN coming/VBG from/IN the/DT central/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN during/IN the/DT noisy/JJ happy/JJ hour/NN ./.

the/DT running/VBG water/NN in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN the/DT place/NN with/IN the/DT swans/NNS made/VBD up/RP for/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN i/FW do/VBP n't/RB usually/RB like/IN embassy/NN suites/NNS all/PDT that/DT much/JJ ./.

regarding/VBG that/DT happy/JJ ,/, hour/NN ,/, it/PRP sounded/VBD like/IN great/JJ fun/NN when/WRB i/FW was/VBD in/IN my/PRP$ room/NN ,/, but/CC going/VBG down/RB there/RB to/TO spy/VB it/PRP out/RP in/IN person/NN gave/VBD me/PRP some/DT average/JJ hummus/NN and/CC popcorn/NN ,/, etc/FW ./.

first/RB of/IN all/DT ,/, if/IN you/PRP have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN to/TO an/DT embassy/NN suites/NNS ,/, the/DT set/VBN up/RP is/VBZ everything/NN ./.

they/PRP are/VBP all/DT suite/NN rooms/NNS ,/, some/DT bigger/JJR and/CC some/DT smaller/JJR ,/, but/CC they/PRP each/DT have/VBP a/DT sitting/VBG area/NN in/IN the/DT ``/`` front/NN ''/'' of/IN the/DT room/NN on/IN the/DT inside/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN and/CC the/DT bedroom/NN in/IN the/DT back/JJ facing/VBG the/DT outside/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN ./.

but/CC ,/, if/IN the/DT building/NN is/VBZ on/IN a/DT highway/NN ,/, then/RB the/DT highway/NN noise/NN is/VBZ in/IN that/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT room/NN ./.

what/WP was/VBD a/DT delight/NN though/RB ,/, was/VBD that/IN smack/VBP dab/NN in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN it/PRP all/DT ,/, they/PRP had/VBD two/CD live/JJ swans/NNS in/IN a/DT running/VBG pond/NN there/RB ./.

your/PRP$ opinion/NN may/MD vary/VB though/RB ,/, so/RB if/IN you/PRP like/IN embassy/NN suites/NNS ,/, then/RB this/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT better/JJR ones/NNS ./.

beautiful/JJ to/TO look/VB at/IN ,/, i/FW just/RB lingered/VBN near/IN them/PRP for/IN a/DT while/NN which/WDT gave/VBD me/PRP a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT time-out/NN in/IN my/PRP$ busy/JJ day/NN ./.

i/LS tend/VB to/TO be/VB in/IN the/DT camp/NN who/WP does/VBZ n't/RB care/VB for/IN them/PRP all/DT that/DT much/JJ ./.
