still no dead pixels .
perfect for movies and games .
one of the best 17inch monitors .
have had no problems in two years .
this lcd screen has been wonderful to me .
if you can find it , get it .
i choose nec because of my experience with them in my line of work .
not even a little that i could tell .
bought this just over a year ago .
the inflexible stand and crummy osd button interface .
