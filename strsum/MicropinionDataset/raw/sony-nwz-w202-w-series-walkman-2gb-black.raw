$$;
Pros:. the miniature size of such an awesome thing with their features. 
Cons:. nothing!!!! their aint any flaws. 

$$;
Pros:. compact,super stylish. 
Cons:. absence of screen, nt water resistant. 
Summary:. its pretty gd. 

$$;
Pros:. sound system , sound division system. 
Cons:. nothing there to tell. 

$$;
Pros:. Long battery life.. Very light.. Small.. Good fit (comes with three sizes of interchangeable rubber ear bubs).. Cheap!!. 
Cons:. No LCD screen.. 
Summary:. I used these jogging and when I train aquarunning in the pool. They are super-light, have good battery life and very good sound. But they also make a perfect mp3 player to throw in the bag for short trips or commuting. Excellent build quality too.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love this Sony.It does everything they say at a great price and sound. 
Cons:. My only gripe is no options on the music order so it's hard to partition the different styles of music I like.. 
Summary:. One thing I don't get is people saying things like "It doesn't have a screen"Neither does nano,I mean it's only 2 GBs.My biggest problem with any MP3 has been the bloody cords.Sony NWZ-W202 is the cure........... 

$$;
Pros:. small. doesn't look as dorky as you would think. amazing battery life. includes a plastic cover for the front half. 
Cons:. the jog dial doesn't always respond, some times it takes a second try. puts pressure on the back part of your ear. juts out quite a bit. its a bad idea to put it in your pocket, since it can adjust the cord preeminently. 
Summary:. This may be my favorite mp3 player of all time. I've broken nearly all of my earlier electronics, so having a player this cheap is great. the sound quality is surprisingly good, but there isn't much bass, but thats probably because i can't get a good seal.. I also think its suprisingly cool looking.. FYI i found mine at my local Target on clearance, and I've seen them on clearance for other targets.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, convenient, good sound quality, no wires to get tangled with or deal with. Stays snug in ears even when running.. 
Cons:. I wish there was more internal memory with provision of a micoSD card for added memory so you could add more songs. An FM tuner would have been good too but I guess there is only so much you can accomodate in the small device.. 
Summary:. By far the best little electronnic device I bought/own.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sounds amazing with a great fit. Super easy to put songs on. Zappin' in feature both makes me feel awesome and make me feel futuristic. Easy to adjust and use while active. Why did it take so long for companies to make this? Buy it!. 
Cons:. I think it would be cooler if this didn't have a stand and only plugged straight cord-to-computer, but it's no big deal. I haven't had it long enough to know, but I hope it stands up to rain/sweat/other moisture.. 
Summary:. I have had this for about a week now, and its every bit as awesome as I expected it to be. Lightweight, easy to use- was anyone else sick of armbands? Headphones that didn't stay in? This thing rocks and is my favorite purchase of the year! Seriously, it rocks. If you run or exercise to music, get this.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek, solid build. Attention to detail. Great implementation of Zappin. Nice looking dock. Snug fit. 
Cons:. No problems so far.. 
Summary:. Sony has created an amazing product that they should do more to capitalize on. The device is sleek, solidly built, with great attention to detail. I especially love the way the two sides snap together and turns off in respond.. The Zappin feature is surprisingly well-implemented. Annoucements of "Zappin in", "Zappin out" and sound effects enhances the experience and makes sure you feel in control. Compared to Apple's speaking shuffle solution, this solution is much simpler and works much better in practice. It is so much easier to recognize a song by hearing it compared to listening to a robot say its title.. Some reviewers have the cheek to complain there's no display. That's precisely the point of this player. It's meant to be worn on the head. This player is about how to solve the problem of headphone cords and still providing a reasonable interface.. 

$$;
Pros:. i have been waiting for this since the invention of the mp3 player.no cords to tangle.comes w/ 3 sizes of ear pieces to accomodate all.sound is great.battery life is great.comes with 14 day trial of napster.could not be any easier to navigate.buy it.. 
Cons:. none. am sure apple will be right behind this player.. 
Summary:. was so tired of the cords on headphones.now i am free. you will not be disappointed.sony scores big with this unit.i have various ipods,but this is fantastic.no muss,no fuss.downloads are simple and quick.once in your ears,comfortable and no movement.they stay put.buy and you will will put your ipod away.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sound quality A+. Comfort A+. Workout-proof A. PC intergration A+. Battery life A+. 
Cons:. No delete button. USB port does need a cover. Maybe "rubberised" rather than" metal" would make it feel more gym-proof, but I think that's psychological.. 
Summary:. Disagree with "not sweat proof" reviews. Worn correctly (natural not complicated) the set fits great and I don't see how it can fall off. Vigorous cardio+weights on hottest Seattle day ever (104f/40c) - no problem. Sound quality A+ Agree the usb port should be rubberised but it hasn't caused me a problem. Blue-tak could fix this for current owners. I would love a delete button - then you can upload all the songs you want and delete the ones you don't.. 

$$;
Pros:. You can carry it easily.. no worry of wires to fall off. 
Cons:. No video but only music.. 
Summary:. I recently bought this, its just goes inot your ears, no wires , no hassels.. Fit while driving, in gym, while playing with my kid. Perfect fit for me. Memory is 2 GB ( its available in 4 gb as well) sufficient to store MP3's . Zappin function to hear &#38; shuffle music. its gives 4 sec playback of all songs , I can easily select te song. 3 min charge and 90 min playback is there.Its hassel free, time saving entertainment.. 

$$;
Pros:. What a mp3 player in this category should be! So ahead of Apple in this segment; Sony really hit the nail on this one!. 
Cons:. None so far. Two gigs of memory is more than enough for any work out, and the supplied ear pieces should suffice most users.. 
Summary:. There's nothing else better that this out there! If you work out and are tired of your headphones falling out or getting tangled get these!! If these can handle sweat, rain, and general moisture effectively then Sony just hit a home run!!. 

$$;
Pros:. An all-in-one mp3 player that stays in place and doesn't hurt. I take it running and cycling. It is very inovative. 
Cons:. Their updated model should have an am/fm radio. It could have more memory and Sony should have a itunes type software program that integrates with their players.. 
Summary:. I like it and wear it all day without discomfort. A content transfer program comes with the player which makes it easy to drag from itunes and drop into the player. I listen to podcasts.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very small and subtle. Cool design. Good sound quality (not much bass). Stick on your head greatly. Awesome battery life. Easy controls. Zappin. 
Cons:. Not waterproof. Content Transfer only analyzes AAC files. Earbuds may not fit you at first. No rewind/fast forward. Only 2GB. 
Summary:. Probably the best sport-friendly MP3 player out there. Waiting for third-party protect case and firmware upgrade.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light, Durable, good sound, easy to use, and quick charging. 
Cons:. 2gb needs more like 4 or 8 at the same price. 
Summary:. I just got this a few days ago and I will never go back to wired this are going to start a new generation of mp3headphone combinations I just hope sony markets them right cause if they did they could change the market or at least grab a big chuck of it.. These work perfect for anyone whos actime I've been mountain bike riding and wieght lifting and there perfect they never shift or move at all and the sound is always so clear and loud. I dont ever miss the whole screen thing no more casue its not needed when you working out the jog dail is really usefull for skipping tracks and the zappin feature isn't that bad after you get use to it. I recomend these to anyone who wants something to work out with or just dosnt want to deal with earbuds no more I would say this thing is well worth the money even is the storage is limited a bit. Plus at least it has controls you can use unlike the new ipod I think its a waste of money and I should know I retured it with in the first week of owning it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well designed, simple and compact. No screen is no big deal. It works like a dream, and if you used a nano this is just as easy. Best thing is not dealing with headphone cords or weighing down pockets w/ peripherals.. 
Cons:. Doesn't fit my ears perfectly. I run to the smaller end of ears and it gets really uncomfortable if I wear it too long.. 
Summary:. I don't know about the sweaty guy or the water resistance or lack there of. It doesn't really have the look of a device that was meant for the hard core exercisers. Its great to wear around when you want your hands free to do things. Its got a decent amount of on board memory and the battery life is ok too.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1&gt;Stylish,ultracompact,unique design.. 2&gt;Good build Quality. 3&gt;Good Sound Quality. 4&gt;3 pairs of earbuds provided as per your liking.. 
Cons:. 1&gt;Not resistance to water or sweat.. 2&gt;Lack of FM Radio. 3&gt;Lack of Sound Recorder and other features. 
Summary:. I purchased this product about 2 months ago.I am relieved that it is working fine till now.Many people have experienced problems with this player,mainly because it is not waterproof.Sony has looked into this problem and is providing free service to those who have experienced problems related to sweat.If you are having a similar problem related to sweat then you can go to the nearest Sony service centre and get your walkman repaired for free.For more details,visit the official site of Sony.. Now about this device, i love the unique design which is the only reason why I purchased it.Sound Quality is relative.The player is able to pump out smooth highs and clear mids.But Bass is unimpressive.It is tight but lacks punch.. If you listen Accoustic Pop,Electronica,Trance,Bollywood Pop then you will love the sound quality.But if listen Hip-Hop,Hard Rock or Normal Pop you will be disaapointed because of its bass.OVERALL,The sound quality is good for casual listeners.But if you are a audio purist look somewhere else.Honestly,I listen to my SONY 5.1 Home Theatre(Rs 50,000)and in comparison to that the player just sounds faded.. 

$$;
Pros:. light weight, acceptable sound quality, great turn-off feature, good battery life. 
Cons:. The ear pieces are angled at a funny angle for my ears. I have tried all 3 sets of ear pieces and also bought a double flange ear piece and just cannot get a lasting seal. No seal, no bass!!! Wish this sealed like Etymotics!. 
Summary:. If the ear pieces would consistently seal, this would have been a great device. But because of the design and also when doing active exercising, the seal is always broken and the sound quality nose dives.. Updated. on Sep 14, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the ease of use, wear and operation. Ideal for workouts.. 
Cons:. I have purchased TWO on these walkmans...both stopped working after 3-4 uses while exercising. If the moisture from sweat is the cause of the malfunction, this needs to be addressed by Sony. Exercisers, beware!. 

$$;
Pros:. Styling, Zappin In feature, features, price point. 
Cons:. Performance at the gym - earbuds WILL come out when you start sweating.. 
Summary:. I really wanted to like this player. Really, I did. As soon as i saw it was available I bought it. I was a little nervous that it would not fit into my ear canals as I have tiny ears and it would not be the first time ear buds did not fit. But alas, the product came and they fit! They actually felt great. I'm not going to talk much about the MP3 features- everything is fine or up to the level i expected. The zappin in feature is awesome. I think the jog dial could be a little more sensitive so you don't have to spin it so hard to change the song.. Then i brought it to the gym. It works great the first five minutes, but after you start sweating....the ear buds WILL fall out. I tried everything. I switched the ear bud sizes, I even covered them with foam pieces from other earbuds to absorb the sweat...they do not stay in place. Which is sad, considering this is where the product was marketed - to gym users.. So unless you don't sweat, I would stay away from this product.. Anyway, i decided to give this mp3 player away to my father since i already own other Mp3 players. Good idea, bad execution. If they could fix this i would be head over heels for this MP3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. very good sound and easy to use. 
Cons:. not sweat resistant , i have had the device replaced twice by sony ..the last one didn't even last for a month.Very disappointed by the product due to this problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent design, form factor and usability. Loved the zappin feature.. 
Cons:. Not resistant to sweat! The player conked out within 2 months of purchase.. 
Summary:. This product, with all its beauty, is useless. I've been trying to get my 5k rupees back since two weeks now. The player conked out because sweat entered the system through the Mini USB port. The service centre employees actually told me not to use it for workout or jogging.. The wheel on the thing is called JOG DIAL, for crying out loud! Sony is misleading people by saying it has produced a player for workout since this aint it. I am deeply disappointed with this purchase and strongly recommend people to buy something else if they want to listen to music while running.. They have used the excuse of a workout player for many drawbacks:. 1. No playlist support,. 2. only 2gb of space,. 3. no screen,. 4. no seeking in songs,. 5. no 3.5 mm jack and hence, no direct output to speakers to listen to music on some other speaker system.. I'd have pardoned ALL these drawbacks - had it really been a workout player. Its NOT. Now these drawbacks are really looming large.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great idea. Concept is perfect for Gym or road work - usual Sony sound quaity and ease of use if it worked.. 
Cons:. I have tried 3 of these over a period of 5 months (I am a real Sony fan and thats why I persevered) but I have now given up due to its inability to cope with perspiration.. 
Summary:. If your a serious Gym user i.e. you do it properly and work up a sweat then dont even consider this product. If you go there to chat, then its fine but then there are far cheaper products that can serve this puprose Oh dear, Sony - youve really shot yousely in the foot with this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. NWZ-202 is a wireless MP3 player, which eliminates irritating wires around your neck. It is very useful gym and outdoor activities such as jogging, cycling, etc. It has reasonable audio quality to enjoy the music.. 
Cons:. Surprise for you! Follow this procedure. -	Play 4,5 songs. -	?Zappin-in? and ?Zappin-out?. -	Increase the volume. -	Continue listening songs. Now decrease the volume? you have a surprise! It works as ?Zappin-switch? instead of volume control!!! LOL!!. 
Summary:. If you?re ready to give a try what this new product all about, go ahead. In case you?re looking for a typical, simple MP3 player easy data transfer and without solving puzzles when you use the MP3 player look some other model/brand. NWZ202 is not for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. First off, I SOOO want this to work for my. I love the way it feels. It fits great, no wires. I don't care about not having a display. It's just perfect for working out. When it works, it works great.. 
Cons:. I've turned one in already, and I'm getting ready to send my second one back. It goes into Zappin mode on its own, It shuts off on its own. turns on on its own. I don't know what causes it, but it's identical in rpoblems to the first one.. 
Summary:. Just don''t sweat on it. The charge connection is open and vulnerable to sweat. Funny for a piece that is advertised for working out with. It seems real sensitive to that. They need to put a plug over that port. The design is great, but consistent performance needs to be more hardy. Sometimes in the cradle, it doesn't take a charge. Sometimes it loses battery life very quickly. I think the 12 hr time is all the time it's off the charger, not just operating time. Make sure you charge it before each use, and don't get sweat on it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Too few to mention.. 
Cons:. Just had the first unit replaced after 3 uses. Wish I had read "BEWARE! NOT SWEAT RESISTANT!" before I bought it. Don't waste your money if it's for use while exercising!. Zappin is a pain (always comes on when you don't wan ti) and no fast forward.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Great design concept. - User controls are easy to use and great for intended use. - Great for use during activities that will not make you sweat. - Charging/Docking station is well designed and attractive. 
Cons:. - Once you start to sweat, the unit nnedsconstant position adjustment to maintain good audio quality.. - Needs adjustment after turning your head from side to side.. - Impact activities, such as running, make the unit sag to an uncomfortable position. 
Summary:. Cons Cont:. - earpieces lay across your face.. - Not suitable to use during any activity that causes you to sweat. I am a huge fan of Sony, so this poor review is hard to write. In my opinion, this product was not thought through, or tested properly before being released. All the reviews referring to problems with sweat and malfunction are accurate. My unit completely died on my third work-out. I was running for 27 minutes, when all the sudden the unit said, "Zappin", which I did not activate. It started playing the short clips of songs, the jog dial stopped responding completely, and now the unit will not work at all; not even light or respond on the docking station.. I would recommend this product for someone to use on a plane, while gardening, working around the house etc, any activity that will not make you work up a sweat. It is absolutely not suitable for more active applications. There are other design improvements I wish they incorporated, but I'll worry about that when a reliable product is released.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Fit, Battery life, Ease of use. 
Cons:. NOT SWEAT RESISTANT! Won't work with playlists.. 
Summary:. I got these for my wife who is a runner, and initially she loved them. She had previously been using her Palm Treo 755P with a Motorola S9 stereo bluetooth headset, but she never really liked the fit of the Motorola headset, and she hated carrying her phone, and lastly, probably more the phone's problem, but the stereo bluetooth connection was unreliable at best. I saw these on "First Look" from CES, and knew I had her solution. I waited and waited for them to come out, they were taking a while to show up on amazon.com, but I saw them one day in a Target (for only $55 I might add). Well I snapped them up right then and there (they were the last pair). Got them home. put some of my wife's music on them, and she was off to the races. Well, needless to say, they didn't last long. After a few weeks, I noticed rust forming around the magnet part that holds the unit together when it is charging, as well as mineral deposits (or perhaps sunscreen) in the mini-USB connector. I told her that I had seen a few complaints about sweat, and to make sure to keep them clean after she ran. Well, she went to use them later that day, and they were dead. I reset them, and was able to get them to turn ot, but no luck getting them to charge or even recognize on the USB dock. Moreover, the unit got very warm when I attempted to charge it. Worst of all, I had bought them with a gift card, and can't find the recipt, so I guess I am just out that $55. I am really tempted to get another pair, but this time from amazon, but I think I might wait untill the Palm Pre comes out and try going back to the old solution of the bluetooth headphones.. The other wank (minor in comparison to the sweat issue) is that there is no playlist support. They could have put in a tiny LED display just to select a playlist, say before a run. I would have prefered this feature by leaps and bounds over the Zappin' feature, which I didn't fine very useful. OK, rant over.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sexy design, ultra comfortable as you lose completely the wires. Good sound quality. Pretty good idea, as it could have been the best mp3 player for working out.. 
Cons:. NOT SWEAT / MOISTURE RESISTANT. Kind of a joke since its market is focused on people who will use it mainly for working out, jogging, etc. Volume will max out, and the song-skipping-wheel will not function at all.. 
Summary:. I?m highly disappointed with this product. The whole idea of working out without hassling with wires made me want this mp3 player since it was announced a while back at CES. Couldn?t wait for it to hit stores, so I ordered from the sonystyle store. When I finally got it, I went to the gym and after jogging for 30 minutes with it, the controls become irresponsive. Volume maxes out and it didn?t lower if I pressed it. Can?t skip songs nor get zappin to work. I am so pissed off that a product like this that it will be used by people for working out can?t get sweat on it. I guess the testing team is a bunch of nerds who just tested it jumping or walking around their cubicles for about 2 minutes.. If you are thinking of buying this and you are planning on using it to run or for working out, I would advise you to wait and see if Sony can address this big issue. If you workout without sweating, then go ahead. I guess that?s the way Sony thinks people do exercise, without sweating.. 

$$;
Pros:. None. Last slightly longer then a 3rd gen shuffle under normla jogign conditions.. 
Cons:. Will stop working in a few weeks of normal jogging - not sweat resistant. The volume control stopped on mine. The controls are difficult to operate whilst jogging. Unformtabe headset. takes some adjusting to stop ear piece popping out.. 
Summary:. This, like the 3rd gen iPod Shuffle, is a waste of money for joggers as both devices completely fail after being exposed to sweat. A waste of money if you intention is to use them for exercise.. 

$$;
Pros:. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT - when it works... the zappin feature is AWESOME.. 
Cons:. I FRAKKING HATE HOW IT DOESN'T WORK.. I bought this four days ago... used it for cycling, going to the gym and general walking around etc.. As of this morning it has frozen 6 times in the middle of songs and i have had to reset it more than 10 times. 
Summary:. Pros - Zappin, sound is good, light weight design, the LED decorative light is pretty, pretty looking mp3 in general, love the docking stand, reminds me of a holoband used in caprica.. CONS - un-reliable, freezes up in the middle of songs or before using it, no playlist function, lack of general support from sony, memory could use a couple of extra gb.. Buy at own risk.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, good sound quality, ample storage, convenient to wear. This should have been THE gym junkies mp3.. 
Cons:. This product does not function in the sports/fitness environment. Get sweat on it and it WILL let you down.. 
Summary:. The fatal flaw with this product is its total lack of ability to cope with sweat. This is inexcusable given that it was initially advertised (at least in my gym) as a way to work out without the inconvenience of wires. I notice that Sony has since (quietly) declared it unsuitable for this purpose: not good enough I'm afraid because that was the sole reason for my purchase. Mine lasted about 6 weeks incidentally, which seems to actually be above average in terms of life span.. Sony need to address this pronto or risk losing its long-standing reputation for reliability and quality control. I have been buying Sony products since the very first Walkmans of the early 80s, but recently the company seems to have lost its way, particularly in its focus on the customer. I will be demanding my money back and looking elsewhere for a conventional mp3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks great, good sound, light, easy to use - what more could you possibly need on the run. 
Cons:. First one failed after one week, replacement last two weeks and I desperately tried to keep the sweat off - I made a real effort. But they failed and failed totally. I'm extremely disappointed.. 
Summary:. I got a refund and went and bought a new one from a different retailer in the hope it was the batch... and this one came with a note saying it wasn't sweat resistant.... SONY that is a weak cop out and crap. Is that the action you took to ensure the units wouldn't fail.... adding paperwork stating not to use it near sweat. I'm taking this one back unused because I require to work out with my player. Very sloppy work SONY.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightweight, not wire tangling issues which is the reason i got it the moment i saw it. Cool, all the world will think that it's a bluetooth device when it's not.. 
Cons:. NOT SWEATPROOF. Dont get fooled into using it while working out. Old models had issues, new models had their circuitboard coated with sealant against sweat, but USB port isn't, so sweat WILL STILL enter into the player and ruin it.. 
Summary:. Don't buy it for its purpose, use it while lazing around only. and strictly not for sports, i just wasted 60GBP in 2 months of using this rubbish mp3 player from SONY. i wonder did they ever do any testing on its parts against sweat. NOt too much to ask isn't it?. 

$$;
Pros:. No wires but not else good to say because it doesn't work. 
Cons:. Any moisture causes the forward to stop working; it doesn't charge; volume escalates to a point of causing hearing loss and you can't turn it down. 
Summary:. I returned the first one because it just stopped working. I am now on a second unit and it is doing the same thing. Moisture has caused the forward song dial to stop working and now it won't accept a charge.. Definitely don't purchase this if you do any exercise.. 

$$;
Pros:. only pro - is great sound and comfort.. 
Cons:. unreliable. On my second unit (replaced first thru warranty). Guessing both have stopped working due to sweat or heat. Called sony about replacing second unit, they told to let it dry out for a couple a days and call back! awful customer service. 
Summary:. don't buy it!. 

$$;
Pros:. I see no pros in this MP3. 
Cons:. You can not used them in the GYM, exercise, and in Summer. 
Summary:. Don't Buy This Usless Product, I would thought Sony is better than this. Worst product I ever buy in my life. you cannot used them in Summer if you sweat a lot, and for sure cannot used in the gym, the sweat will kill it. They will ask you to pay for the repair even when I was told that this is design so I can go running with it. And they ask me to pay for the repair.. 

$$;
Pros:. Integrated features, good sound, lovely design and colours. 
Cons:. It does not have bass booster, what is available in the inferior models of sony. Could have come with an lcd helpful for selecting songs. Playlist cannot be worked out. The USB port has a direct contact with sweat.. 
Summary:. After my purchase, i came to know that sony walkman w202 is facing many problems due to sweat and the company has put a notice of changing the same from the service centers. My first concern is why, a brand like Sony would manufacture such a faulty product, which is meant to be used during activities like gym, sports and other stuffs. After 3 days of purchase, i found the piece to be dead. Not charging, not being recognosed by PC, Keys not functionink, became warm when the connection was on, I have taken it to the company, they replaced the piece, but, again the similar thing is happening with the changed piece. This is not at all expected from a company like Sony. I think since i have waisted my 5 k for this piece of crap, i would never go for sony again in my life. Pathetic product of a pathetic brand with pathetic service. Shame on them....... 

$$;
Pros:. I bought this product to use while running. The unit is comfortable and ergonomic and sound clarity is nice.. 
Cons:. It died 30 minutes into my run. After reading all the reviews I believe it is sweat related. That's a ridiculous statement considering it is supposed to be designed for active use.. 
Summary:. I would recommend waiting to buy this product until Sony issues a corrected version that is not a failure in the field.. 

$$;
Pros:. great concept. lightweight. easy to use when you get used to the Jog dial. 
Cons:. Bad user guide. Does to fit in properly, hurts after an hour of use. Died - possibly due to sweat after a single workout!!!. 
Summary:. The concept from Sony is great. I am a Sony fan and was waiting to get my hands on this. But was totally disappointed after first use.. First of all, not a lot of features for playing music, but that's ok for the size.. I used this in the Gym for a couple of hours and my workouts are pretty intense. I did about 45 min of cardio and then weightlifting.. First off, my ears started hurting since the buds did not fit in well.. Next the player just died the next day. It just did not start up and refused to work. Not happy! I do sweat a lot (and who dosent in an intense cardio session) and maybe thats got something to do with this?. I feel robbed. I am going to turn this in and get a replacement of something else.. 

$$;
Pros:. If this device were remotely reliable, it would be the perfect answer for those of us who spend endless hours in the gym. Very comfortable, good ergonomics... innovative shuttle feature.... 
Cons:. After seeing the review here on CNET, I promptly ordered the W202 thru the SonyStyle store... and was thrilled with both the form factor and sound when it arrived. It lasted three days in the gym. The replacement broke two days later. Stay away!. 
Summary:. I've now spent two hours on the phone trying to get a reasonable response from Sony regarding expedited replacement of my second NWZ - W202. I was told by their tech support that these are being returned by the dozen. My intuition is that the open mini-usb port on the headset allows sweat to wick into the unit... not a very slick design element for something specifically designed for the gym. Please heed my advice - this is a no go....
