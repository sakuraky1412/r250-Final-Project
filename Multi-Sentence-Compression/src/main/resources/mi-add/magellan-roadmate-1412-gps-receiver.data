i wish i had bought this years ago  .
it saved my marriage  .
my wife and i are always lost and always balme each other  .
i am useless with a map  .
it is so easy to use , setup and navigate  .
i is up and running in minutes  .
the best thing is the points of interest  .
you can type in swim and it will find all the indoor and outdoor pools nearby and direct you  .
we discovered beaches and parks nearby that we did not even know existed  .
i tried the tom tom and this beats it hands down .
i would definitely feel comfortable recommending this one to a friend or loved one  .
it's a nice one for the price .
wife purchased the magellan roadmate 1412 for a gift for father's day  .
we live in ontario canada , and she purchased the unit at our local canadian tire , which had them marked down from $299  .
00 to $149  .
($150  .
00 off)  .
so far i just love this gps  .
the screen is a wopping 4  .
3 and the color and clarity of the touch screen is easy to see someone mentioned in one of these reviews , that the roadmate 1412 doesn't tell you what side of the street your destination is on mine does loud and clear , when i am about 5 or 600 feet from my destination  .
the ladies voice tells on which side , so maybe they've added this feature to the newer models i is disappointed to see that my new unit did not come with an a/c power chord to charge the unit in my home , as well as the unit not having a usb chord to up/download maps from my home pc  .
however , i found these accessories on e    bay for a mere $7  .
95 each , with $2  .
00 shipping , so no big deal really all in all , i'm very happy with this unit , and all it's simple to use capabilities  .
the only thing to see now , is how long it will last on a level of 1 to 10 , i'd have to rate this unit a very strong 9  .
if you find the magellan road mate 1412 on sale like my wife did , buy it , cause i truly feel it is the best bang for your buck hope this helps ,  .
i bought this from costco on father's day , and after instant rebate i got it for 150 bucks  .
it's the best at this price  .
immediately after that i did use in newyork , and i have already recovered investment  .
great for startes , no hassles , easy to use and clear instructions  .
if you are in us and speak english , then why to worry about other languages .
my lowrance gps died so i is looking for a new one  .
it's a simplistic gps in which you don't need extras such as blue    tooth , fm transmitter , picture viewer , or traffic updates  .
one thing i like about the 1412 is that it does not have a hard drive (less to break down)  .
the whole map is in an sd card  .
it's light and durable  .
i once dropped it and it still worked  .
the enunciation is better than other gps i tested and that's important because i live in hawaii where street names can be a tongue twister  .
also , inputting an address is easy as pie  .
some gps units cannot input an address if there is a dash involved in the street number (mio moov 300)  .
overall i'm happy with the unit  .
you can buy a more expensive one but if you're not going to use the extra features then it's money down the drain .
a good low end model , and well worth getting on sale if you want a device that will get you around with a minimum of hassle  .
if you want more , spend more .
i bought this unit 2 weeks ago from costco for $150 w/ the coupon regular price @ costco is $199 which still is not bad compared to $299 most other stores want  .
despite what others have said , this is a fantastic unit , especially for the $  .
i had a garmin c330 previously and this thing smokes it  .
i also have a garmin nuvi 200 i bought for my ball and chain  .
the mrs saw this unit in action and is immediately jealous  .
widescreen  .
the text to speech works great , doesn't sound like a robot like most others  .
this unit had by far the strongest gps signal lock out of any gps ive ever used  .
i turned the mount upside down and i keep the unit in my cup holder , and it works great ive even used this in my house try doing that with another unit my garmin will ask if im inside a building and it doesn't work until i go outside  .
the touch screen is very responsive and the unit processes button selections very quickly  .
this has navtech maps which have always seemed best in my opinion  .
the maps seem up to date i live in the phoenix area and there are many new roads and freeways not on my other units that are on this one  .
(someone complained about not being able to download new map updates this is because this is a brand new model and there are no updates available  .
) the minor gripes i have with this unit are as follows 1  .
who in their right mind would use an abc keyboard layout in place of the qwerty that were all familiar with  .
(at least it automatically greys out letters that arent possible to use)  .
it is fancy enough to say you are now arriving at best buy  .
but it does not say what side of the street the destination is on  .
this is not the end of the world , but most other inexpensive units have this  .
these are really the only cons i can think of at the moment i is hesitant to buy a magellan since ive always used garmin but i like this unit so much i just bought a magellan maestro 3200 for my parents  .
(i stole it from best buy today  .
it came w/ a $30 bag/case and the whole bundle only cost me $129  .
(same interface , smaller screen , no text to speech but still a solid deal  .
) there are alot of people complaining about gps systems not having bluetooth or mp3 players or picture viewers  .
who cares  .
you get what you pay for  .
talk about wanting a filet mignon on a big mac budget  .
there is no such thing as a perfect gps unit non of them are completely accurate all of the time but if you want a great unit at a great price , check out the 1412  .
be thankful that its only $199 instead of $499 like a similar gps would have cost just 1 year ago  .
happy travels  .
great product    i'd buy it again if i is in the market  .
however , like i said , the street names and exit numbers are quite garbled   instead of saying exit eighteen , the prompter says , exitoneeight  .
this is not , however , a big deal  .
i had either a first or second generation magellan and my brother has always had tomtom    and i must say that my magellans have always out    performed his tomtoms .
updated  .
on jan 12 , 2009  .
have had the magellan 1412 for two weeks  .
returned a tomtom xl    s (poor signal , could not pronounce names correctly)  .
magellan works great  .
nice big , clear screen and pronounces names clearly and correctly  .
can also receive signal inside house when programing  .
also has six million poi  .
you also have the ability to create your own poi  .
i would recommend this gps as a good value for the price .
this is my first gps and it has more than i am looking for  .
real time traffic , who cares  .
i live in reno  .
too much traffic in your city move  .
would like the map to update a bit quicker but i do not speed and you should be looking at the road in front of you not the gps  .
and it says that when you start up the gps  .
the map location is about 50 to 100 feet off but if you are not speeding it gives you a good update  .
i hate the way the entry of names/streets are  .
it goes exactly abcdef it would be better if it is a standard keyboard layout  .
even my blackberry has a keyboard layout  .
waiting to see if i can load trails for my atv ; it has a sd slot so it should work and i would not need anything else  .
just because they make funny tv adds got a uni    brow jonjon does not mean they are better  .
higher price to pay for advertising .
i have only had this unit for about a week , but it is a solid gps  .
it gives plenty of warning (much better than my older garmin c340)for each turn starting at two miles out and then a bell when you approach the turn  .
the text    to    speech is as good as can be expected and the screen is easy to see and read the windshield mount is solid and it finds satellites very quickly this gps does not have all the completely unnecessary gadgets like mp3 or video viewer , nor does it have a traffic receiver , but it's very easy to use and a great unit for the money .
great 1st gps  .
still too new for a complete review , but so far , i love it .
i'd purchased a magellan maestro from costco , it worked well , but the screen is too small  .
the 1412 is exchanged for the maestro  .
the screen is more legible , the instructional voice is clear with text to speech , the split screen helps at an exit ramp with multiple branches  .
i've run it almost two hours off of its own battery versus the car charger i now use it locally to save gas , because it will find routes shorter than i usually norm the only bad things and they are minor , is that when you ignore its route selection , it does not say 'recalculating' like some of the others  .
it just does it and gives you new instructions  .
plus it does not have a home charger  .
with instant rebate , i got it for $150  .
i think it great  .
overall , i think this unit is better than the garmin nuvi 260w i just returned backt o the store  .
the features are comparable , but the nuvi had wider selection is voices to choose from  .
the nuvi did not freeze up  .
the 1412 , however , locks in in satelites alot quicker than the nuvi  .
both systems have outdated maps , at least for the area i live in  .
the 1412 showed some streets that do not exist anymore  .
i think the map is at least 3 years old  .
some pois are outdated as well  .
during a search of my area , it came up with stores that have been out of business for years  .
for example , it showed a wal mart that has been clopsed for 5 years  .
overall , i think this is a better value than the garmin  .
side by side , the garmin looks better  .
but i give the magellan the edge in performance and value .
all in all it's a good gps system that has served me well these past few years just like any other system it'll route you the long way once in a while , but my main beefs is the cost of a map upgrade , and the fact that there's nothing yet available for 2010 what's the point now in purchasing the cable , and older 2009 map for when i can get a new tomtom , or garmin from new egg for less  .
so far , i like it  .
my first gps  .
and , have a garmin 205 operating side    by    side with the 1412 in 'real    time' sure let me experience some things i might not have realized , otherise like the garmin keeps telling you (kinda too soon) about an upcoming turn  .
the 1412 gave me plenty of time , and goes into 'split    screen' mode at critical locations intersections  .
i've got a decent amount of hearing    loss (legally hearing    inpaired) and i can hear the 1412 better than the nuvi 205 (and the 1412's speaker seems to be larger , too) and , even though you have only that female voice it's easy to hear and understand  .
the 'simulator' mode let's you actually 'run    thru' a simulation of your destination (3    choices of speed) to see if that's what you want to do , or not  .
i have both units right here with me on and running as i am doing this review i entered    in a nearby gas station the garmin is having trouble aquiring the sat  .
s and , if it has trouble doing that it's like 'the blind leading the blind'  .
as , i'm sure , you are all aware there's nothing quite like that feeling you get when you're in complete unfamiliar territory it's dark 2    3 people have all given you just enough directions to totally confound you and very few people have good enough communication skills to even give good , concise , directions (there should be a licensing proceedure) and the 1412 got me to where i needed to go , without misleading me , or loosing it's sat    com signal or , it getting confused , too  .
the garmin allows you to enter a new destination as a 'new' destination , or , as a 'via' point (on the way to the original)  .
it also allows you to touch a point on the map for a reference (to add a note , or name , or other) , where the 1412 doesn't seem to wanna let me do that but then again i've not had this an entire day yet have not connected to the internet to check for updates nor have i become 100% on the 'operator    scale' just yet  .
but    since i have done a side    by    side 'real    time' comparison of the 205 1412 the 1412 is much easier to understand and the screen is wider , making it look bigger , and easier to view  .
and walmart had the 1412 for $140 + change  .
if i run across any additional pros or cons , i'll try to give an update i'm not gonna say it's the best thing since 'paid    vacation' but , there were a few times i only had the garmin 205 with me (prior to buying the 1412) , and i was not a 'cappy    hamper' alone in the dark lost vehicles wizzin' past at 90+ and no where to even stop and ask .
as an entry level unit , the 1412 is just okay  .
even with clear skies above , the unit just seems slow to me  .
the only other gps unit i've had is vz navigator from verizon for my cell phone  .
the vz is much quicker to give directions  .
there are several times that i've passed my turn because the unit is simply too slow to give me directions  .
the set up , the screens , and the functionality of it all is just okay  .
if you're searching for an entry level gps unit , i'd go with a garmin nuvi       i've heard much better things about those units  .
still , the magellen is not terrible .
the only purpose a a baseline gps is routing  .
i unfortunately dropped and broke my garmin c330 so i had to replace  .
i decided to try the garmin , found a great price on a refurb  .
wish i had spent the extra $ on a new/refurb garmin  .
garmin routing is much and in a model like this , that's all that counts  .
and the touchscreen , it does not work to the touch , it needs a stylus major bummer , especially when driving  .
updated  .
on oct 16 , 2009  .
main problem is getting genuine replacement part and getting a quick resolution from magellan .
love it when it works but will not buy another magellan because of this  .
our cheap mio never froze .
not recommend to buy magellan gps due to poor service and non    updated products without satisfied support no map sd card as mentioned in the web specification found in the package after bought  .
calling customer service to complain and the feedback is the map of 2 years ago has been install in the gps and therefore no sd card given  .
however , updated map is not available for download  .
it has to pay an extra delivery cost around $25    $30 to get a free updated map sd card for the new map  .
also , you have to buy your own sd (if you are not going to pay for the new map sd) for backup of the address/poing of interest stored in the gps  .
also , there is no ac adapter for battery charging  .
compare with tomtom xl , this gps is more expensive and not worth to buy it  .
complaint for the extra cost of the sd card reaching their superior level has no solution too  .
helpless .
i got a great deal on this gps at costco and loved it at first  .
it is great to find all kinds of locations in new cities  .
the rerouting could be improved  .
instead of having me do a u    turn when possible , it often took me several miles out of the way to turn around  .
sometimes the directions were wrong    but that is not the norm  .
the worst part about this gps is that sometimes when i is typing in my destination , it would completely freeze up and i had to unplug it , turn it off , and start all over  .
it is a little slow at times announcing turns after you took them  .
i returned it after 2 weeks .
costco had a great deal on this unit for only $149  .
with such a deal , how could i lose well , the unit is slow since day one and after just one week , the screen died  .
i thought of getting another one , but is just dissapointed with the whole experience  .
so , i bought a garmin instead and am much happier  .
do not buy a magellan gps unless you want to roll the dice  .
they offer defective products and no customer service .
never again will i buy a magellan device  .
support and design left much to be desired .
by the time it took to load the cd and find the topic i wanted to read i is already turned off , this is stupid , why not a booklet  .
the one i have now , a garmin 200 does everything well and yes it has a book  .
is a good product as long it works fine , if something goes wrong and you need costumer service good luck updated  .
on nov 6 , 2009  .
finally it started smoking and now it is past warrantee  .
magellan asked if i used another charger that didnt come with it  .
(i didnt)  .
they said i can turn in for another newer discounted refurbished one it is on fire  .
i will not go with magellen .
i can not express how unhappy i am with this product  .
i received it as a mother's day present last year  .
my husband purchased it for $230  .
it worked ok for the first few months  .
it occasionally gave you the wrong directions which is ridiculous  .
then the screen started to freeze up and the unit would just turn off  .
now it will not charge and is not working at all  .
there is no way to check or change the battery  .
calling magellan is a complete waste of time  .
i is placed on hold for 30 minutes only to be told that there is nothing we can do but offer you a discount on a new one  .
asking for a supervisor does not help either  .
i is put on hold again for another 10 minutes only to have to retell the story over to some supervisor  .
not helpful at all  .
i is told that electronics sometimes just crash and the only thing they could do is offer me a refurb  .
one for $87 or a new one for $130  .
please do not waste your money on this piece of junk  .
there are others out there for less money that work much better  .
i will never buy another magellan product again  .
i got this at costco for my brother for $135 (including tax) literally less than an hour ago  .
the text    to    speech capability , big screen and the price convinced us it is a good buy  .
unfortunately , this is one of the things that's too good to be true  .
i have a mio c220 myself and i love it , not to say that it does not have it's quirks , but it's definitely better  .
the magellan is not intuitive , took me a while to figure out which end is up , so to speak  .
there are definitely less options available ; no choice in voice , only 3 languages available , 30 poi maximum search at a time , cannot add via points , screen has frozen 3 times , no access to sd card , just to name a few  .
the pois are outdated and there is not even an option to update them  .
maybe i would warm up to it after a couple more uses , but i doubt it  .
this is definitely going back tomorrow updated  .
on may 2 , 2009  .
i am very disappointed about this gps  .
this gps loses signals and sometimes it will mislead you  .
there are many more gps that are so much better  .
there are some fees that you have to pay to get the whole thing to work  .
i bought another gps after this one which is a garmin and let me tell you garmin is perhaps the best  .
no hidden fees or loss of signals  .
do not get this gps what so ever even in a life or death situation .
if you believe in god then you will believe in me  .
this cheap peace of plastic is not worth the money  .
i bought this brand new from best buy  .
i charged it , then tried to turn it on but it wouldn't  .
i thought i did not know how to turn it on  .
so i called the company  .
after a long talk they told me it is broken  .
so i went back to best buy and got it exchanged  .
so my new one worked  .
this gps does not have aaa support  .
this gps is not smart enough to guide a stupid person nor a smart person  .
after keeping it for 4 weeks it broke again  .
best buys return policy is 30 days  .
it broke again after 32 days please trust me , not worth the money i went out and bought a tomtom gps and it works spectacularly lessoned learned    if it is a cheaped price item do not buy it because it wont work .
NONE. I DON'T HAVE 1 GOOD THING TO SAY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT EXCEPT SAVE YOUR MONEY!; SCREEN FREEZES,POOR QUALITY INTERNAL BATTERY,GIVES WRONG DIRECTIONS, TAKES LONG TIME TO FIND YOUR LOCATION,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,NO OWNER'S MANUAL,OUTDATED POINTS OF INTEREST,OUTDATED MAPS,NO WAY TO UPGRADE MAPS,NO WAY TO CHANGE BATTERY
Got me to where I wanted to go.... when it worked; Freezes up. Unplug. Reset. Freeze.
Have not got lost get.; Did not get my free upgrade for maps, mistake from costumer service. Have been going in circles for about 3 weeks and won' receive service for ti, since battery ain't working also.
there are no pros for the peace of plastic; every thing in the gps is horriblle
STRONG GPS Signal, LOTS of POI's, Text to Speech, Widescreen, etc; ABC keyboard instead of qwerty, doesnt say what side destination is on
6 million points of interest is probably the only god thing; every thing else is bad in this gps device
Price, size, screen, look and feel, graphics.; Freezes, needs more features, voice is hard to understand at times, touchscreen is slow to react to taps.
Small, light weight, easy to see/read screen; Finger prints on touch screen and street entry screen
Price is good ($150) at Costco with coupon; Good feature set; Too slow; No home charging unit; battery life is very low; inability to download updates; The Magellen web site is challenging to navigate
Text-to-speech capability; big screen; light-weight; loud; ability to avoid routes easily; Not intuitive; no hard copy of manual; no ac adapter or USB cable; screen freezes; difficult touchscreen; limited POI search; outdated POIs....
Accurate, gives plenty of warning, understandable TTS; No traffic receiver, no external volume, only one voice, limited languages, POI's difficult to find with spell feature
Voice is clear, easy to set up, works fine out of the box.. PRice was $89$.00 from Tigerdirect.ca; no ac charger, no Qwerty keyboard.
Large Screen, super clear voice, huge POI database, bell chimes when approaching a corner, up to date maps, great satelite reception; for $199 at Best Buy.CA I can not complain about anything for that price
I have been using Magllen 1412 for two months and it works good, shows a small panel while taking turns, which avoids confusion on taking exits.; Arrow (car) on the map is little misleading, it is always few meters back from the original car location.
Comfortable 4.3" screen with its slim size.; Price not compatitive when hidden cost is counted. No Map SD card included as mentioned in the web spec. Map is not updated in the GPS. No Map for download.  No AC Adapter for battery charge. Screen freeze sometimes.
easy to use and read.; Problems with getting replacement part that works with unit.  Sometimes gives wrong directions or the directions are far out of the way to get to a place.
Worked ok while it worked.; 1412 usb plug also broke on me just after the 1 year warranty was up and they gave no customer service except they offered to let me but another unit from them at a discounted price, then when I asked to speak to a supervisor they hung up on me.
I liked the Roadmate 1412 although not as much as my Garmin.; The low rating is due to the product design. The GPS has a USB connector for power. The USB has twice broken off the circuit board and broken off on the auto charger. More time spent in repair than in use. Support sent out non-working devices as RMA.
I love the way it tells you a turn is coming up. Much better than the Omnitech that I returned to Staples. Tons of POI's. Good fast signal compared to Omnitech. Right before a turn, it reminds you with a chime.; Doesn't tell me if I'm speeding! The Omnitech did but I guess I can watch for signs the old fashioned way!
Beautiful large clear colored screen. Voice instructions very loud and clear, with plenty of verbal warning when approaching intersections or exits. Very user friendly, an ape could figure it out. Option of 3D or 2D screen. Thousands of POI.to choose; Unit doesn't come with USB chord for up/downloading to and from PC, or wall mounting electrical charger. (only cigarette lighter type of charger).. Battery life doesn't last the 3 hours Magellan state they do.. No carrying case
at $147.00 at walmart it sounded like a good deal, it was'nt, luckly they took it back. it did look pretty HA!!!; the touch screen was more like push, did'nt work well. it comes with a cd you have to run in your computer to get information and help topics, no booklet to put in your glovebox and take with you on the road, hated that. to hard to use
Fairly easy to use...Gives more than adequate time for lane changes/exit ramps...Sound is decent, and screen is easy to see/read...Got it for $150 on the 2008 Black Friday weekend when it was normally $240.; May take a few minutes to give current location.Some touch screen issues.Old 2009 map (Jan 2009 or Dec 2009?) is all that's available for $80.Need a USB cable for the few updates/downloads via the Magellan web site that'll cost ya another $15.
Small &#38; light-weight; wide, bright screen; clarity of the voice prompts (see cons, too, thought :( ); lots of poi's; The only con I really have is that the voice prompts are difficult to understand when they're not defaults: i.e. street names and even exit numbers can sound garbled.
Was able to correctly locate and guide me thru unfamiliar area that the Garmin 205 couldn't find or show. A friend loaned her 205 to me on a trip to Canada, Ky., and my inlaws have the same unit. Both 205's get/got 'lost', but not the 1412.; I haven't as yet, found any sort of 'security' in the 1412... which the 205's have. Think about it. If someone did rip-off your GPS... would you want them know where your home is, or that of your family/friends, etc.? I just bought it today, though.
Love the interface.  It is a basic GPS that does all I need.; Screen will not respond to touch when hot.  magellan just kept telling me to reset it, but it always does it again and now I have to hold it in front of the AC to get it to work at all on hot days.  It's a GPS......It is supposed to be in the sun!
I've had this GPS for about a year- easy to use, volume adjusts (I have hearing loss), large screen,plenty of warning before a turn-off. It doesn't have some of the fancy extras, but is also much less expensive.; The plug in the side of the GPS is almost broken off. No paper manual. Sometimes, it gives me a route that is much longer. Before a long trip, I usually confirm the directions on mapquest, and then check my GPS for the same general directions.
