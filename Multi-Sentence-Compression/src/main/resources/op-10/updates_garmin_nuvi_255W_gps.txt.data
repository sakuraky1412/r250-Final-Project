> Links up flawlessly to my Mac using Garmin RoadTrip, WebUpdates, etc .
The maps seem to be fairly updated .
,  Speed of map updates is awesome .
easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .
More often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .
The map update was about 2GB in size .
it's a curiousity for most of us, traffic and content updates   .
This clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .
update and reroute much _more_ quickly than my other GPS   .
