i used it with the firewire 400 interface , and there were no problems .
worked right out of the box , powered up and formatted .
there is a need for the software to work .
but i used it for time machine purposes , so no worries i have always used seagate for my exteranals and internals .
i have had two lacies fail in the time i have owned one of my seagates .
always liked their product , and their strong warranty keeps me coming back overall , great product .
after trying to get the my book drives that would not work on vista .
the seagate drive worked perfect , what a relief .
so easy to use and a great looking product perfect .
thanks for this product .
very good storage backup .
supplied backup software is worthless .
-LRB- i 've tried several other brands of hard drives and their software is not any better .
do n't believe in disaster recovery . -RRB-
for total system backup use norton ghost .
i 've had to restore my system twice , drive failure and virus attack .
yes i do have an anti virus program .
used freeagent drive and ghost , had absolutely no problems and did not even have to reload operating system before restore great warranty seagate , put an off/on switch on drive .
i purchased 2 of these 750gb esata drives at best buy for $ 199 each .
i have had drives in the past , but these have a 5 year warrenty , and are quiet as thye use a heat sink .
in addition i am getting a 182mb p/s with esata vs a 20mb p/s burst rate via usb .
so backups and media copies are fast .
the bad news is that i have contacted seagate and they have no way to use the drive utilities for 64bit os 's .
i cant disable the lights , or adjust the sleep state unless i hook the drive up to a non 64 bit os .
but once the power is lost , the settings revert back .
this is the only downside .
in your test opinion it is written but in the models that include firewire 400 connectivity , you can remove the usb/esata module from the bottom of the base and replace it with the dual connector firewire module thats outdated .
today all connections is the one and only module .
let me preface this by saying i 've only owned this drive for about a day .
therefore i can not fairly review its performance .
this review only covers my out of the box issues with it .
i might give a performance review once i 've owned it for over a month the issues i have with the drive are pretty minor , but they are really irritating because they could have been easily avoided and are just lame and a bit ridiculous on seagate 's part first of all , it does not come with an esata cable .
i do n't understand this .
it 's an esata drive , and it comes with a usb cable and a firewire cable .
so why not an esata cable .
thanks seagate , now i have to go out and spend $ 25 on an esata cable .
so those of you hoping to use this feature might as well tack on $ 25 to whatever you are paying for this drive second in order to use the firewire port , you have to unscrew the usb/esata port module and screw in the firewire one .
i did n't see any reviews that mentioned this , and it 's pretty impossible to tell from most pictures .
i do n't see why they did not just have a firewire port along with the other two on the same module .
that would 've made a lot more sense .
especially since you are essentially paying $ 30 more to have firewire capability included .
i 'm pretty sure i could 've gone out and got some cheapo firewire adapter for less than that if i had really wanted to use it with just the usb/esata version third , and this one 's also a pisser .
the included software and backup apps -LRB- freeagent tools -RRB- will not install on a 64 bit os .
i 'm running windows xp pro .
64 bit , and it told me it basically supports everything else .
thanks a lot .
i 'm pretty sure the actual program would work fine if they just let it install , as plenty of other 32bit apps work without issue on this machine .
there 's probably just some dumb line of code in the installer package that wont let it .
whatever the reason get with the times seagate .
so 64 bit users can also go ahead and tack on the price of a drive backup program they will want to go buy one other minor annoyance the power plug is an odd rectangle shape horizontally , not vertically .
imo , this is even worse than a regular fat plug , because even on fat plug specific sockets , you have to use up 2 spaces unless you put it on the end slot .
also something that could 've been easily avoided i 'm sure finally , i 'm not sure if this is an actual issue or not .
this drive is cooled by a heatsink as opposed to a fan .
i have no issue with this theoretically .
just so you know though , because of this , the base gets very hot , even when not in use .
when in use , it begins to smell like burning metal .
i 'm not sure if this is the standard for heatsinks on drives , or if it 's just due to cheapness .
if you format this drive and use it as a hard drive without the supplied software youve got a useful drive .
the backup utility is really hit miss .
still i would recommend this product .
hi , .
i gave this a 5 because the product price included the online backup , but that service is useless .
i recommend not to buy the pro version but buy the normal version instead i bought the pro 500 gb , so i could back up my files online and have local storage .
seagate offers a free 6 month trial for online storage , but get this its only for 500 mb .
500 mb .
my hardrive holds 500 gb .
they do not even have a pricing for online storage of that size , and i did not even order the 750 gb drive while most free emails are giving 1gb to 5 gb of storage for free , 5 gb of storage costs $ 12 a month .
i would guess that most people buying a 500 gb hardrive have online storage needs of greater than 5 gb i 'm not sure what their marketing department is thinking when it made this decision .
i would question the use case that they based their online storage on .
for the cost and features consider simple tech .
i have subsequently got 1 of the signature drives and it runs cool compared to this drive .
footprint is not substantially larger than that of the segate .
the other seagate is now starting to make noises so i am only using it as an external drive and not as a backup .
the only way to hook it to the desktop is by a usb and when the system -LRB- computer -RRB- is fired up it gets stuck on the boot up and will not pass go or collect $ 200 .
i tried to find a cure and the only response is to unplug the power cord then plug it back in after booting up .
i have a pro tools studio and bought this drive to use as a streaming disk for the audio files .
well , the drive does in fact work .
although it goes to sleep within one minute after inactivity -LRB- a stupid idea by seagate to conserve energy and go green or whatever their logic -RRB- it still streams the data very fast .
it just sucks that under mac you can not change the sleep interval at all .
in windows , you can even change it to never go to sleep .
that 's helpful if you 're going to use it all the time .
it takes about 30 seconds to spin up and get going once it is in sleep mode , but it 's too much trouble to worry about .
for a product that says that it 's mac/windows compatible , i sure have not been convinced yet .
i 'd go with a lacie or a maxtor , honestly .
seagate internal hdd 's are great , though .
thought this would compare .
i think that seagate 's failure to support 64 bit operating systems is pathetic and backwards at best .
if you want the support for the latest and greatest , do not buy seagate .
the power supply is clumsy and impractical .
sometimes it turns on , sometime not .
if you want to still keep it , open the enclosure and purchance an external enclosure to use with the hard drive because it 'll still work .
i bought this drive because cnet rated it well and i liked the esata option .
the problem is the drive is not reliable .
after a month of use it does n't mount .
i had another external drive -LRB- lacie -RRB- with a seagate drive inside of it that did the same thing .
steer clear of these external usb drives and find another solution for storing your media if you can not afford to lose it .
i have been burned in a big way by seagate .
or order two drives , mirror them , and expect one to fail .
if you just get one drive and put your media on it , do not be surprised when all of a sudden you 've lost everything and are facing an $ 800 data recovery service cost .
i do not understand this drive and tech support can not explain it .
the number of files stored keep increasing daily when i only check e mail .
i wanted a drive to back up serious files , not to fill up with temporary files .
tech support trys and is very nice but can not explain how to fix .
need help wish i could just manually back up or at least get direction from tech support .
i bought this based on the cnet rating , but missed the paragraph that mentions they did not test the e sata .
what the hell .
how can you rate it an 8 and not test the single most important feature anyway , i had to go through a lot of hoops to get some secret firware update that stops the e sata from crashing the computer , but data transfer is still barely faster than the usb i think anyone would be better to buy an encloser and hard drive separate .
i bought this external hard drive less than a year ago and the other day when i plugged it in i came to the cold realization that it had overheated .
there is a known problem with the design of the product and seagate refuses to acknowledge it or take responsability .
this is a serious issue and i need help finding resolve .
let me start by saying i sell enterprise storage and backup solutions for a living i .
e netapp , emc , hds , etc i purchased this to provide backup and additional storage for my home system .
the backup software is included but it 's only a trial version something seagate does not clearly state anywhere .
so , if you plan on using it to run backups you better budget another $ 30 into the cost the drive has been quirky from the beginning .
it would be on but would stop showing to my computer so i had to constantly restart it by powering off and back on 1 3 times monthly .
finally , within the first year it completely failed and will not power up .
while it is under warranty , it is exchange only .
seagate , in their infinite wisdom states -LRB- a true response from seagate . -RRB- .
it may be returned for exchange .
you will not receive your original drive in return please back up all data before returning the drive .
are you kidding .
if i need the warranty is not there a better than average chance the drive is broken and not responding .
how do you propose i backup my broken backup drive .
you would think seagate is new to the disk industry with a stupid request like that .
i would take a look at hitachi or western digital before ever buying a seagate for home use again .
if i buy a disk for backup i do not need it to fail like these seem to be doing all over the country .
also it is not 500gb as advertised its like 450 or less , they also use false advertising .
waste of time , money and resources .
more over lost my precious back up data within 2 months please do not buy this drive .
i would highly recommend maxtor or lacie quadro -LRB- though it iis bit more expensive -RRB- .
dud wasted tons of time and money trying to make this work for me .
should have known better than to load data on this lemon .
power would go off for no apparent reason .
still loaded over 35gig of data on the device when it completely failed contacted seagate who were happy to tell me they will replace the equipment as it has a five year warranty .
i owned it for two months and loaded data for about one month when it failed .
they were also happy to tell me if i wanted them to try and retrieve my data the minimum cost will be $ 700 .
thanks , but this boat anchor is not worth any investment , especially when they said it is very unlikely i will get anything back never had an experience like this before and will never buy seagate again stay away .
i had this drive for more than half a year only and from the start i knew it is trouble .
the autobackup software is buggy and had installation issues .
when i solved that problem , it then started to over heat and the aluminium is extremely hot to the touch .
even when it is not hot , for some unknown reason it will disconnect and my pc can not read the drive i had to go buy another half terabyte drive just to back it up -LRB- and having huge problems because it keeps turning off by itself -RRB- so that i can send the thing for repair or replacement by seagate btw i did not mention earlier the on/off sensor touch switch does not work i had huge problems with a maxtor drive a year ago and now a seagate .
this is probably the last time i will get product from this company .
the e sata did not work from the start .
gradually after two weeks file can not be read .
seagate replaced -LRB- under warrenty -RRB- with a freeagent -LRB- not pro -RRB- a cheaper version and no e sata .
did not give code for memeo -LRB- backup software -RRB- registration with the original drive , and had to pay for it memeo backup missed many files programmed to be backup up .
memeo tech support read all log files and instances and had no idea of a fix an unreliable backup is as bad as no backup .
we bought the hard drive -LRB- 750gb version -RRB- in august 2007 .
by september , it had burned up .
we called for warranty service , after which they gladly sent us a spare .
one problem , all of our digital pictures and home videos for the last 15 years is on the drive we sent the failed drive into seagate 's data recovery service to get the data off of it .
after two weeks , seagate charged us $ 300 for the warranty replacement without any notification .
it took several hour long yelling matches with warranty support to finally get them to recognize that they actually had the failed drive and to refund our money -LRB- we had to threaten them with reporting a fraudulent transaction to the credit card company before they finally confessed -RRB- after $ 1900 to their data recovery services department , they sent us both the replacement drive and the failed drive -LRB- we had made explicitly clear that they should send it directly to their warranty department -RRB- .
while we have our digital life back -LRB- literally -RRB- , i would n't wish this experience on anyone run , do not walk , away from any seagate freeagent products .
they 're record in taking care of their customers is less than abysmal .
i filled up this drive with dvd 's and it kept coming up with crc errors and i got so pissed that i ripped it apart and hooked it up to sata in my desktop and no problems what so ever so im guessing there adapter in the base of the is faulty but thank god i do not have to back up my dvd 's again .
bottem line i feel seagate owes me the difference in price from the hard drive and the freeagent drive but i 'll never see a dime .
wish i never bought it .
the drive failed the second time i used it .
it wiped all the original information on my laptop ; waited 3 months for them to send an apparent faulty power cord which they never did , i ended up buying a second drive to in fact see if it is the power cord -LRB- it was not .
is told any replacement drice would be a refurbished one , not new , and that data recovery to see if any data can be saved -LRB- which i doubt -RRB- starts at $ 750 to $ 2500 .
i have yet to wait for customer service to respond to my initial complaint about a power cord -LRB- which it is not .
that has been on backorder for the last 3 months i is always told they were a great company but i will never buy seagate again .
this unit 's first problem is that it would not turn off .
it is supposed to turn off and on when the computer does , however , my seagate turned itself back on immediately after the computer is shut down .
seagate support had all sorts of different reasons for this , including instructions to rub the underside of the unit .
main problem is that the full backup did not work .
i did a spot check of my files in the seagate after a full backup and everything appeared to be there , however , when i actually did re format my computer , i could not find the picture files anywhere on the seagate backup .
thank god i had a 2nd backup on dvd .
this unit is unreliable and does not power down with the computer as stated in the minimal user instructions .
also , seagate support is not good as everytime i told an agent that i could not find the pictures , they hung up on me .
i am returning this unit to the store and buying another brand .
lots of space ; ca n't rely on it Nice design ; Power supply is clumsy and unpredictable Easy to set-up ; Backs up temporary internet files ?
Excellent build quality ; Fails to support Windows XP Pro x64 or 64 bit Vista Esata is 5x faster than USB - Quiet HeatSink ; Cant turn off light or use utilities for Vista 64bit absolutely no redeeming virtue save for its design ; overheating , hangs and disconnects , buggy software fast transfer and burst rates ; sleeps WAAAAY too quickly , hard to wake Sleek , quiet ; No 64-bit software support , akward power plug , no eSATA cable included , must swap out USB/eSata to use FireWire Impossible to find anything good about it ; Stay away from it Lots of space , when it works ; Where to begin ?
lightweight and easy to throw ; it overheats !
I do n't have any except maybe that it looks cool when it is working. ; 1 -RRB- Very quirky 2 -RRB- Unreliable 3 -RRB- Backup software included but only a trial version 4 -RRB- Seagate 's customer service A lot of stoage for the price , Simple to use ; Online storage is useless Looks nice ; This unit failed to back up all my files .
After restoring my PC to original factory state -LRB- all my files were wiped out -RRB- ; Seagate restore failed to backup my pictures .
Thank god for DVD backup I had .
You get free ability to loose your precious data in about two months of use !!!!!! ; Failed with `` delayed write '' in about 2 months .
I have to pay $ 20.00 for replacement with refurbished !!
Firewire &#38; ESATA connectivity pretty quiet .
Automatic Sleep mode. ; Inconsistent performance .
Freezes and wo n't power down .
Me and Spouse each got one for our own PC 's .
Spouses crashed after 3 months .
Units run very hot , poor air circulation , vertical footprint makes it easy to tip over .
It 's Sick looking and has pretty lights .
It has plunty of space for my pictures -LRB- of the kids and Hot Rod -RRB- ; Read below , I said to much and as a Army guy with a basic Dell and Seagate EHDD and basic computer capabilities I believe the summary will say it all .
I like the look , but it 's a piece of electronics so that means NOTHING !
; It overheats to such high degree it melts things it sits on and burns my fingers , then it stops working until it cools off .
Then only works periodically .
You can not access any files and most of the time the drive does not get recognized
