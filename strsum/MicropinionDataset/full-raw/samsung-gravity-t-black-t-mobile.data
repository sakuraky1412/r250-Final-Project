i really like this phone  .
it's fast , and if you are patient , it will work with you  .
it's great for texting and social buzz is a good way to keep in touch with your friends  .
it's browser is not that good however .
even though this is not a 'smart' phone , for me it has plenty of features that suite me just fine  .
the build quality it great ; slider feels solid , keyboard is easy to view/use and the button feel is good  .
the speaker phone is loud and clear , and reception quality is superior to my old phone , especially on the other end where people have told me i'm very clear when they talk to me  .
i've never had a touch screen phone before , but i've found the touch screen on the gravity t to be very easy to use and responsive once i got the hang of how to scroll and tap propperly  .
i've rarely used any of my camera phones , thought the 2mp camera on this phone is nice  .
the only thing i would have liked is a built in light for the camera , but i can live withou it  .
and the micro sd slot is great for extra memory for music and video  .
all in all this is , for me , the best phone i've owned so far .
good phone for texting  .
good touch screen  .
this phone is awesome , if you buy it , i highly doubt you will have any regrets , very good for its price , overall , a very good , functional phone  .
i would recommend this phone for people who aren't willing to spend a lot of money on smartphones , blackberries , or iphones  .
this is a nice touch screen phone with a slide    out qwerty keyboard  .
it also has a decent camera , although there is no flash , you can edit pictures  .
there is also a night time mode on it which is nice  .
the keyboard is a little flat but it doesn't give me any problems , i find it very nice  .
the widgets are a nice feature  .
it's very easy to use and fun to play around with  .
i've dropped it about 8 times so far and it's only got 2    3 scratches on it very sturdy  .
(i dropped in a cement and from quite a high distance , too) overall the texting is great and it's one of the main reasons i wanted to get this phone  .
the interface is really nice and personally i like this phone better than the lg xenon , which is similar  .
i know many people with the xenon and i like the features on this phone better  .
this phone didn't come with a usb cord or sd card but lucky for me i already had an sd card from my previous phone and when i want to transfer stuff onto my gravity touch i just insert the sd card into my old phone and plug that in  .
it sounds like a long and annoying process but it really is not that bad  .
i don't transfer much on and from the sd card anyways so this did not pose any major problems for me  .
you can always buy these accessories seperately i've had this phone for approx  .
3 months .
i have had mine less than a week and i am pleased with the performance and features  .
the sound quality is better than most phones i have owned  .
display is better than expected also  .
2 mega pixel camera takes decent pictures and video if you are on a budget and want a touch screen without being roped into a data plan , this is a great choice  .
after getting through he learning curve , a very useful , versatile , quality device  .
samsung and t mobile have packed some great features into this phone at reasonable cost .
this phone is great  .
it makes keeping in touch a breeze , and has great widgets  .
a bit slow at times , but you wo not notice it too much  .
does not work with gmail  .
bottom line , great phone for beginners and people who are just looking for a non    smart phone , touch screen keyboard phone  .
it's a great bang for your buck  .
buy it at costco , it's free  .
excellent phone  .
i upgraded to the gravity    t after own the t    mobile tap which in it's sell is a decent phone but felt more as a starter for those just getting use to a touch phone  .
the gravity    t has pretty good reception , little to no static , stylish , great battery life , cool features and way cheaper than the other smart phones (moto cliq , my touch slide , google g1 ect  .
) on the market today  .
great phone , especially when coming from a plain old bar phone with no text/web (nokia 5310)  .
calls are clear and easy to understand  .
email setup (for gmail , hotmail at least) is very easy  .
i have not found a way to download emails only when i want to receive them , not at a specified interval  .
touchscreen seems to work well though sometimes i need to hit a link a couple times on websites  .
processor is pretty quick , though sometimes it does lag but not too long  .
the phone is well built , solid  .
overall great phone with a few minor annoyances , but i expect that with every new phone .
the phone works great and has a very nice feel to it  .
yet i like the use of extension dialing , i hope this gets added , or maybe i'm missing the process of using it  .
small inconvenience for such a great phone .
the bottom line is that this phone is worth the money and will not disapoint you  .
however if you wanted a smartphone capable of everything this is not for you  .
i would definitely recommend the gravity .
we did not want to pay for a data plan because i am home most of the time with access to the computer and dh has a company phone with data , but we wanted a full qwerty keyboard for texting  .
we also wanted a phone that could go overseas and accept a sim card from another country  .
we were formerly with att but all of their full    keyboard phones required a $20+/month data/text plan  .
we got this phone at costco for free with the two year plan (had to pay the tax on $200 each)  .
we are able to turn on and off a data plan if we travel and want to get our email  .
so far we are very happy with the call quality and the features of the phone .
good phone , needs a few improvements  .
hardware     .
the phone is equipped with a full qwery keyboard and the slider has a very good feel and click to it  .
the design is clean , and while it is a bit uninspired , it looks fine and i would not be reluctant to use it in public  .
it is not particularly heavy or thick , but a happy medium of both  .
the touchscreen is very colorful at 262 , 000 colors and is fairly usable in sunlight  .
s only resistive and lacks the accuracy of say , an ipod touch  .
but it is very good and among the better resistive screens i  .
ve used  .
there is no 3  .
5mm headphone jack which is a little annoying seeing how most new phones today have them , but this isn  .
t meant to a multimedia device so it  .
s not too major  .
the phone is equipped with an accelerometer , but it is used in very few applications , such as the video and image viewer  .
finally , the phone is equipped with a 184 mhz processor which doesn  .
t sound too great on paper compared with all the new 1ghz snapdragons out there , but the phone chugged along fine  .
at some times , the phone did stop to think and i did experience horrendous lag while using the music player but shutting down the phone and restarting it fixed the problem and i experienced next to no problems after that  .
if it  .
s a big deal for you , try it out at the store , but it  .
s not an extremely big problem keyboard     .
the virtual keyboard is nothing special , but i did like the haptic vibration and the very big keys  .
it has a fairly accurate t9 and i did not mind typing out short messages on it  .
there is no virtual qwerty keyboard , but seeing as there is a full physical keyboard , i can see why samsung did not include one  .
the physical keyboard is nicely spaced and i made few mistakes on it  .
i wish the buttons were raised a big higher , but it is fine  .
the keyboard is backlighted and has directional buttons software     .
the phone is using the newest touchwiz software which allows you to customize three homescreens with various widgets  .
unlike other phones , such as the samsung behold , the screen is not too cramped as widgets can be placed on more screens , creating a far less cluttered look  .
it ran nicely and the menus are very finger friendly with big icons  .
the processor did hamper things from time to time , but only if i crammed the screen with 5+ widgets just for fun  .
there's a nifty smart unlock feature which lets you draw shapes to access certain features , such as the music player  .
there is one application named social buzz for social networking and while i have not used it yet , i have seen demos and it seems to be an adequate replacement for mobile social sites such as facebook and twitter the music player is good enough for basic playback  .
like i mentioned before , without a 3  .
5mm jack , this is not meant to me a multimedia powerhouse  .
however , the speakers were decently loud and had acceptable sound quality  .
the video player handled videos at a 320 by 240 resolution at 15 fps and they looked surprisingly good on the screen with no lag present  .
to round up the entertainment , the phone has a few games but they are all demos  .
you have to buy the full games from t    mo phone     .
my old phone suffered from reception problems and i could barely find a decent signal in the house  .
however , this phone is almost always able to have 3+ bars and with 3g and i seem to have very good reception wherever i go  .
while t    mo  .
s 3g isn  .
t as broad as verizon or even at t , it  .
s available in most major cities  .
the call quality is very good and i did not hear any distortion from my callers  .
the speakerphone put out decent volume and is easily heard the messaging app is sufficient for light to medium texters  .
there is support for im , e    mail , social buzz messages , and of course , text messages  .
texts are not threaded , a big inconvenience to people who text a lot and prefer to follow conversations , but it is still fine camera     .
i is disappointed when i saw the phone only had a 2 mp camera , but it is actually better than expected  .
while the pictures weren  .
t stunning , they were clear and had good amounts of detail  .
there  .
s also a night mode for low light situations and video , which is able to record smooth but slightly grainy videos  .
all in all , it  .
s decent for a phone and ok for facebook battery     .
the battery life on this phone is excellent  .
i pushed it through 4 days of average to heavy use while on 3g for 95% of the time  .
people who use their phones more might burn out in 2    3 days but it met all my expectations web    unfortunately , i is unable to test out data on this phone , so you  .
re going to have to try it at a t    mobile store  .
but you only have to pay $10 a month for data so that  .
s a real bargain , considering normal smartphones now require $30 a month  .
from what i  .
ve seen in demos , the web browser wasn  .
t as good as the safari or android mobile browser , but it  .
s not meant to be either  .
it has a neat one finger zoom that seems better than poking a magnifying glass and the browser itself is fairly speedy .
i have always wanted tmobile to finally have a respectable querty phone like verizon , att and sprint has in multiples already  .
finally a touch screen , querty board that isnt android or need a 25 dollar data plan just to work  .
if i is fortunate enough to pay for one i have no need for it actually  .
i dont need it for my job or lifestyle  .
be nice to go online moving and mobile but really have no need for it , id mostly waste the time and cash paying for the monthly but finally a touch and querty that comes with a 10 plan per month if needed the option to use web and a little cheaper is tempting all in all a good middle of the road phone with features , touch screen , querty board phone finally from tmobile  .
you get what you pay for you have to apply slightly more pressure than say    on the iphone    for the touchscreen to respond , but by no means is it going to wear your fingers out it touchscreen works great and is easier to scroll if you happen to have a stylus playing around good battery life , good call quality , and decent features for this mid    range phone i don't have the need for a full a full smartphone at the moment    i'm near a computer for the most part    and don't need my phone for business  .
so really , all a smartphone does for me is add to the monthly bills  .
don't get me wrong    i've had one and i loved it , but i've realized that since it's unnecessary for me at the moment , a phone like the gravity touch does just enough for me  .
i can stay connected without the huge bill attached  .
it's also a lot lighter on the wallet if you do not want to have a 2 year contract overall , i am happy with this phone after researching my other options with t    mobile , both price wise and functionality .
over all i would highly recommend you put hands on a working model of this phone before purchase  .
if you do decide to purchase it i am using a stylus  .
seems to cut the constant roll  .
not a bad phone , do not get me wrong  .
you just better be patient if you are used to a true smartphone .
easy to use , large screen , female friendly (finger nails) , phone first with high tech features , all make this a great , inexpensive phone  .
the pull out key board is easy to use  .
the buttons feel good , and are easy to see  .
i like that i can get on facebook , send emails , use gps all with out having to pay $35 monthly data plan i really dislike being told that i have a missed call , even after clicking exit 100 times , every time i open my phone  .
(this is in reference to the same missed call  .
) i really dislike having to wait till i'm in an area that has strong signal to send a text rather than the phone simply sending the text when the signal is available  .
i disklike all the multi    layered menus  .
i shouledn't have to acknowledge taht i'm done sending a text 3 times  .
also , if i read the text from the messagign page , i really do not want 3 other notifications telling me i have a waiting text  .
especially if i'm simply trying to make a call overall , it's a nice phone , but still has some quirks updated  .
on sep 5 , 2010  .
most features on this phone are cons  .
the contact function is absolutely useless  .
it only shows three contacts at a time and when you try to scroll through them , the touch screen is hard to use because it wants to select people in the contact list instead of scrolling  .
then when you try to stop the scrolling , it either reverses course at the same spead or it stops the scroll and selects whoever it landed on and dials them  .
horrible horrible horrible  .
the keyboard doesn't make it easier either  .
the touch screen is not worth it  .
i'd rather have directional buttons anyday  .
i've tried several other phones with touch screen and this is the worst ever  .
everything you do on this phone takes you 5 times longer than it should take  .
i bought 5 of these phones for my family members  .
every one of us hates it  .
we ended up trading mine for a blackberry because i need a really good calendearing program and the internet  .
the other 4 phones we traded for a simple flip phone and are so glad we did  .
every member of my family , including the teanagers prefer the flip phone to this piece of junk  .
i do not know how anybody who has really had to use it and count on it for real could give it a good review  .
and it was not just a fluke either  .
we bought and tried 5 with 5 different family members  .
one of them we even had replaced by the manufacturer to see if the earpiece or the microphone were defective  .
the sound on all of them is garbage too  .
we were always saying what did you say  .
i just cannot think of a thing i liked about it except for the nice , big , colorful screen  .
i'd recommend skipping on this one and either go with a real touch screen phone or stick with a simple flip if nothing else  .
also the calendar is seriously lacking the feature of being able to repeat an event on a specific day of the week within a month  .
for example   i wanted to set an event to occur every third thursday of the month  .
cannot do it  .
it will select the 18th of every month but not the third thursday  .
i'd steer clear of this phone at all costs .
i'd return it if i could , but past the 14 lame days tmobile gives you  .
we bought three , and after very little texting and photo taking , all got pop ups that memory is full , and so we couldn't send photos via text    even though we inserted memory cards immediately when we received the phones  .
not obvious how to make photos default to card  .
called tmobile , spent an hour with tech support    they couyldn't figure it out either  .
i messed w/ it another hour or two and stumbled upon the answer by accident  .
that fixed , but photos still horrible  .
every single one is blurry    even if subject just sitting there  .
slowest shutter on any camera    of any kind  .
like not having a camera at all  .
bluetooth doesn't work with windows7  .
calls are always kinda echoey , though loud , and otherwise clear  .
photo viewer ridiculously slow to come into focus  .
not a problem for photos taken with phone , since they're all blurry anyways , but , for photos dragged onto phone from pc , annoying to wait so long ( think dial    up ) for photos to process fully for viewing  .
so , ok phone for texting , though it'll bite you if you send more than 20 photos or so  .
other than texting and a pretty screen , not much good about it  .
unfortunately , tmobile does not offer anything else with full querty keyboard , except blackberry and other vertical styles  .
i would have gone with the lg sentio if they had a slideout querty  .
now i wish i had gone with the lg anyways oh well .
i don't like this phone very much , it is sorta costly being that it is not a fabulous phone , however it is 3g capable if you live in one of the few spots that t    mobile has 3g  .
it's very bulky , the low charge vibration doesn't stop until it dies , is often sluggish , and scrolling periodically doesn't work well  .
would be better if you could still keep the phone closed and then rotate and type on screen with the full qwerty keyboard , instead of always having to slide and use the qwerty button keyboard  .
i do not recommend this phone for techies , otherwise is a great texting phone .
it's a good looking phone , but not for the heavy texters or those who are expecting a really nice camera .
i expected the touch screen to be similar to my itouch  .
not even close  .
i returned it .
my biggest issue is with the touch screen contact list  .
you need to apply pressure and move your finger slowly to keep the screen from scrolling like crazy  .
it's true it scrolls when you want to select a contact and it selects a contact when you want to scroll  .
if you do not touch the contact (or any menu item for that matter) just right it will vibrate and shake at you in the most annoying way       that makes it that much more difficult to hit it on the second try i finally turned off the lock mechanism on the screen  .
so often when making a call you have to hit a keypad       to bypass a vm greeting or to log into work vm       and the instant lock on the phone screen makes that nearly impossible  .
the unlock button on the side of the phone is so small and hard to hit that it takes all your concentration  .
this is so not a one    handed phone another complaint       there are so many menus or prompts to get to the task you'd like to complete  .
i hate having to hit 3 keys to complete a task overall , not a very user friendly phone  .
the unpredictability of the touch screen is the main reason this is going back .
susceptible to temperature , fluctuations in humidity  .
there is nothing i liked about this phone  .
i returned it after two weeks of frustration .
do not get this phone  .
i want a way out  .
i hate this phone with a passion  .
i upgraded to this phone from my blackberry curve 8330 , thinking it would be nice to have a touch screen phone that is text friendly  .
out of the box , you get the manual , the phone and a charger  .
i charged the battery fully , and is entering in my contacts , and noticed that within one hour i went from 5 bars to 1 bar on battery life  .
i drained the battery completely , and recharged before i went to bed one night  .
when i woke up the next morning , the phone is dead  .
i plugged it in , and within 10 minutes it showed a full charge  .
15 minutes later , back down to 2 bars apps will launch unexpectedly  .
when hitting the menu button , on several occasions , the browser launched out of nowhere text messages are not threaded  .
you have to check your sent' messages to see your replies sent to other people  .
if by chance you fill up your inbox without deleting old messages , you will receive a memory full error , and you will not receive any more texts or emails until you clear all history phone is very non    intuitive , and i is lucky enough to be able to use the buyer's remorse clause in my tmobile contract to return the phone if you are 12 years old , this phone is probably suitable for you  .
if you get frustrated easily , stay away from this phone it's more high maintenance than my girlfriend 2 thumbs down samsung  .
i am in the market for a lcd tv , and considered samsung , but after the experience i had with this pos phone , no thank you .
do not buy this phone  .
if someone offers it to you free do not take it you will regret it .
i purchased this as an upgrade for my old rizr (loved that phone) , since i already have a blackberry i did not need this phone to do much more than send sms and make phone calls  .
the process to make a phone call is not bad , trying to easily send a text message is a joke  .
it is way too cumbersome a process  .
even the girl at the t    mobile store thought it is not a good process .
nothing like being excited by a new product only to encounter an epic failure and complete disinterest by the manufacturer .
absolutely the worst phone ive ever owned  .
cuts off on every phone call , touch screen takes about 10 touches before it actually clicks an icon  .
hard to even touch an icon , it always gets the one either above or below it  .
cant type in a phone number with the touch screen , i try to hit a 3 and it hits the 6 , or 1 it hits 4 an so on  .
i tried to take it back but is one day past the required time , so now i have to keep this junk for a year  .
i am unemployed currently so i had to go with the free upgrade and i am so lucky that it is free with the mail in rebate  .
if i had to pay even i cent for this pos i would really be angry .
the screen lags way too much for my liking , to the point when i get mad just to use my phone  .
the touch sensitivity is terrible , i can never feel the vibration , and i constantly have to try and touch the same area because it thinks i'm touching somewhere else  .
my texts are either not recieved or recieved after 1 hour or more  .
terrible phone i'm hoping the store will take it back .
