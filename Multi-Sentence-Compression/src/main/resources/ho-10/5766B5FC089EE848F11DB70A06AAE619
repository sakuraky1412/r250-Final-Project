we had planned to motor around the lugano â€“ como area but instead just spent a lazy day in the hotel : an extended breakfast by the pool , a short walk , an extended coffee on the terrace , a read and rest and finally dinner on the terrace to live piano as the sun set behind the alps !
my wife and i stayed at the villa principe leopoldo for two nights as part of an extended holiday in switzerland .
this is a review for that hotel ; some of the reviews on tripadvisor listed here are for the park hotel principe .
some of the confusion may be caused by trivago ( which i use to choose hotels ) as some of their pictures of the park hotel principe are actually of the villa principe leopoldo .
the suite had two separate bathroom facilities , though no tub , and a cloak room .
quality of furniture and fittings in the room was very high .
it seems to be consistent with the age and history of the building and was particularly pleasing to us .
the public areas of the hotel are a delight , extensively decorated with orchids .
we had a suite overlooking the lake and mountains though the trees wil have grow since prince leopoldo lived here !
air con was quiet and effective and the room completely peaceful .
