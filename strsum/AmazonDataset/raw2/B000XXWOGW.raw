see original remarks, made the mistake of buying it again from same dealer same problems different machine
Save your money !!
Consider the wisdom of spending a lot of money on replacement parts for a 10+ year old washer that you originally bought for $400
This is one of the cheaper parts so I could see getting this one (and maybe the agitator dogs and motor couplings)
If you're having problems with your motor/clutch/timer or other electrical part, you might want to think about getting another top loader like an Amana before they stop carrying them in stores in about a year or so
Great
Just what I needed
The connect did not match up where I had to modidify it to work
