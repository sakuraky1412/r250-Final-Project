the toshiba regza delivers a great hd    picure  .

xbox360 and ps3 have a great looking picture on this tv compared to a plasma lcd is the way to go for gaming .

i see that some people out there say that the picture is very grainy  .

all i have to say to that is your crazy  .

i only have one channel that the picture looks grainy on , but thats due to the poor quality of the channel  .

the colors on this tv are excellent  .

the blacks are very black  .

i also have a toshiba hd dvd player hooked up with the hdmi cables and let me be the first to say it looks great  .

i have also seen sony's and samsung's in this size range and they just do not compare however the samsung's are better than the sony's  .

to sum it up this is the best tv out there .

if you're using this tv for hi    def movies , xbox 360/ps3 , or pc (you need hdmi out for full rez/1920 x 1080) , you can expect it to look fantastic , thanks to the 14    bit video processor colors look crisp and clean vibrant , while blacks look truly black  .

this tv has a lot of punch , visually , due to its vivid colors and inherent brightness in it's price range , it's quite big for an lcd (47') and from the right seating distance (hd material can be viewed closer , of course) , is quite a big tv and does not fail to impress .

purchased this tv from sears and they did a price match to circuit city for $1499  .

the tv in full 1080 programs with the hdmi from my verizon fiber optics people is incredible  .

i cannot imagine television ever getting any better  .

i love the saturation of high def colors in lcd tvs  .

it is soo so bright  .

i would highly recommend this tv to anyone  .

don't pay the $$ for sony's or mitsubishi's or pioneer elites  .

plasma do not compare to the brightness of this tv  .

i is going to get a plasma , but after careful reviews of websites and looking in different stores plasmas do not compare to lcd's  .

good luck  .

toshiba hd dvd too with this tv is fantastic too .

i love it .

it has a excellent picture and sound  .

fantastic tv  .

the picture quality is excellent  .

met all my expectations and then some  .

even using component video , the images are amazing  .

going to get a video source with hdmi output today to fully utilize the capabilities of this tv  .

well worth the price .

we replaced our aging 32 tv with the toshiba and have been loving life ever since  .

the picture is amazingly detailed and clear  .

you could spend thousands more but why  .

the size works well even in a large room and the set itself will likely fit on most standard tv stands  .

i had to remove the doors on my wife's entertainment center to get it inside  .

she was not happy at first , but loves it now  .

i bought this tv and i am very pleased , i am running a 10 year old satalite box on the unit and with a few easy to follow instructions from the manual i is able to adjust the picture quality for a clear bright viewing screen .

got this toshiba after reading consumer reports and getting a great price on cyber monday  .

i had heard all sorts of stories about how hard it is to get sets calibrated to look good and is prepared to invest a lot of time  .

but it looked great on basic cable right our of the box  .

now i'm even wondering if i'm going to spend the extra $$ for hd from comcast .

i bought this tv about 4 weeks ago , could not beat it for the price or any price for that matter  .

1080p for under $1300  .

i have yet to use my ps3 on it with a bluray movie , but my 1080i and 720p picture is phenominal to say the least  .

i recently used the pc input and even that is amazing  .

the people reporting green tint should take them back or have toshiba fix it , must be something wrong with it .

well i purchased this tv a week ago now from bestbuy (i price matched futureshop and got it for $1450) but i is a bet sceptical after i saw the 7  .

8 user review rating some ppl saying that it suffered from a green screen and extremely bad sd quality  .

i decided to take the chance as the price is being cut down 500 dollars from the original price , and if anything i could return it boy is i happy with my decision  .

as soon as i plugged the tv in and my ps3 , it is clear i wasnt going to return it , the 1080p picture quality is absolutely breath taking on this set , and the colors are extremely vivid  .

the blacks are extremely black (2000  1 true contrast ratio) and everything else is just wow  .

the sound some people might not have liked , but personally it does the job in my basement (i dont have a big basement) and the bass sound on it is satisfying  .

another mention is the grainy sd quality either im blind , or its just a specific issue that happened to a few sets that were manufactured because the sd quality is actually pretty impressive , on par with my old sd tv set (which is a sharp btw)  .

i even intend on keeping the sd cable tv subscription i have right now and getting the hd one in the future  .

for the price i paid , it is close to the sharp 37inch 1080p that i is looking at , but when this set came along for such a price , bigger screen and better contrast ratio i wasnt going to go for the sharp anymore  .

only 2 things that were cons up till now are the facts that the box is pretty big and heavy and doesnt fit in small cars  p , and that you would need to purchase a new table or tv stand if you are upgrading  .

well those arent much cons , but watever , i had to put something  .

o and did i mention the 3 hdmi and 2 component inputs in the back  .

fantastic purchase , i whole heartedly recomend this tv  .

i is green when i started my quest for an hd tv  .

study the reviews  .

find an honest salesman  .

i know that sounds like a lawyer joke in wating or like looking for a pearl in an oyster , but they are out there  .

i found mine at circuit city  .

find one , shop more to compare  .

then settle on this tv  .

it starts off spendy    a good shop will negotiate this price  .

check internet pricing for your leverage  .

this tv is awesome  .

i had it out of the box and is watching tv inside of 15 minutes  .

it took longer to get out of the box  .

if you do not have an hd cable box , get a step ahead    no chg from your cable company if already have one  .

you will like the picture alright w/o one but will be blown away once you see the vivid images on this set  .

the sound is incredible  .

the few users citing poor sound have probably not found the srs wow settings yet  .

the speakers are nicely integrated on the strip beneath the display  .

the frame is sleek black and there is no visual detraction  .

the surround fills the room very well  .

other devices integrate easily  .

the only issue i've had is combining my dvr and tv remote so it looks like i will be relegated to 2 remotes but if that's the worst thing , it's not bad  .

the price is right  .

i got mine for $1245 from the sticker price of $1500  .

this is a very close match to the best internet buy .

i am enjoying a saturday game on abc hd and the picture is awesome  .

last night we watched a movie from my digital cable provider and picture is excellent  .

sound is good enough so i am waiting on my surrround sound update  .

i have watched an older dvd and the picture and sound were impressive .

i is watching this tv for almost a year  .

the price is over $1800  .

00 when i first noticed this set  .

found it on sale at circuitcity online for $1299  .

plus $150  .

00 off if ordered online  .

total w/tax and everything is $1245  .

00 great buy very happy  .

would recommend this to anyone thinking about buying a 42 lcd tv  .

this set pulls in several digital over the air stations that i didn't even know i could get  .

the hd pbs station is fantastic when watching a nature documentary or anything else in hd for that matter  .

regular analog stations are not as clear but that's to be expected from all the reveiews and research i had done before this purchase  .

i had considered the westinghouse for a lot lower but glad i stuck with the toshiba it's a much crisper cleaner pic  .

even my regular dvd movies look great on this screen  .

cannot wait to get the hd dvd player .

i purchased this tv last week and i cannot believe the picture on this tv when i brought it home  .

awesome  .

i am not going to tell you any technical information  .

you can find that out for yourself from the cnet specs  .

i can tell you that for a month i did research on the net and in fry's , best buy , etc  .

it came down to the sony xbr series , samsung 42 lcd and the toshiba regza  .

i did not give the toshiba 10 out of 10 because i did like sony's picture better    images seemed to pop out and the colors seeme to me to look true to life  .

i do have to say that with my old dvd player this hdtv did not do so well  .

the image look grainy and the blacks were washed out , but after i hooked it up to a $99 sony upconverting dvd player , combined with an hdmi cable (included in the box from costco) , the picture quality is incredible  .

i have not watched any cable or satellite hd programs yet on this tv , but video games and dvds look stunning  .

i watched my daughter's disney pixar cars , monsters inc  .

and finding nemo regular dvds , not hd or blueray discs , and i thought i is in the movies  .

great , great tv and right now from circuit city this gem costs only $1299 .

we just got this tv and are enjoying it  .

we did alot of research on features and price and decided on this model  .

we bought it at beach camera and were very satisfied with the purchace and delivery process .

i is looking at the 32 samsung lcd's in the $1000 range when i came across this t  .

at a friends house  .

the gaming quality on this set is astonishing  .

when i found out this t  .

is around $1200 , i jumped at the oppurtunity since i is also gaining 10 inches over the sammy i is looking at i signed up for hd cable the day i got this tv set and the quality of the picture is excellent  .

i would suggest tweaking the picture settings around a little since i think factory default is optimized for use in a retail store as a display unit the sound quality is also a plus , the bass reproduction is impressive and the voices come in clear and crisp  .

the only down side to this unit is the vga input limiting you to 1024x768 and the inability to upconvert if you want to pair this tv with an upconverting dvd player , i tried out the toshiba sd    5000 and was not to impressed  .

the samsung 1087p is a perfect companion to this tv  .

i have it set up through components right now and it looks great .

i is kinda of skeptical about buying this tv  .

i have a samsung and i seem to enjoy this much better .

i have had this tv for about a month now and am very pleased  .

for the first time i used just the tv to watch a bluray movie and it performed better than i had expected  .

i have the optical out hooked up to my sony home theater 6  .

1 system so usually use that for sound  .

the problem with the monster cables is a universal problem from what i have seen so far , the cables are difficult to fit in together on any stereo or tv so it's not a problem with the tv , you just have to be careful when hooking up  .

the only time i get a grainy pic is when watching dvd's or tapes through my combo vcr but that is expected since the tv is made for hd and the vcr puts out a 480 signal  .

game mode works well with action and racing games from the ps3  .

i even used the coax (cable) in and it looked ok for the non    hd channels , my cable box upscales a little through the hdmi so regular channels look good when using the cable box  .

and all the pic settings to fill the screen are pretty good , much better than the 3 available on my toshiba 42hm66  .

i would like to see what someone says the optimal settings are for the tv .

if you are thinking about getting an hdtv ,  .

don't settle for 720 p or i and a lower resolution than 1920 x 1080 full screen  .

i upgraded my cable to receive the available 1080 i hi    def channels (they are limited to  .

13 plus one for each movie channel) $75 mo  .

it just does not get any better  .

the digital channels , however , in 480i , vary ,  .

and most are not very good when installing the new box , the cable guy used the standard coaxial cable from the tv to the box  .

i suggested he change it to a hidef cable   the difference is noticable use high quality cable hdmi cables for all connections  .

they are available cheaply online @firefold  .

com and on ebay  .

awaitng cables to hook up my computer screen  .

note   1080 p is not available with my cable company yet or on my basic toshiba sd    5000  .

upconvert dvd player only 1080i  .

can t wait for that  .

i bought the display from best buy in june 07 ($1620) ; due to a what i consider a great financing deal at 36 months zero intrest the regza looks well built with its glossy black bezel , and displays blue    ray movies quite nicley  .

ps3 games look great on this set ; the colors really seem to pop out i think at the moment , this is the best deal your going to find for a name brand 1080p flat screen (lcd or plasma)  .

i considered vizio and westinghouse as cheaper alternatives for an lcd , but their bezels were unatractive the 42in 1080p regza gets a 9/10 because their are fancier , more stunning displays still out  .

10's are reserved for the absolute best , whatever that display is still the regza is a better value than a xbr2 or pioneer elite plasma .

i researched this set for over a month  .

i took into consideration the specs on paper as well as the numerous trips to the store where it is displayed  .

now i know there is a halo effect consumers place on the products they buy but i can honestly say this is a stand out set  .

the colors really pop and the contrast is excellent  .

the blacks are easily as good or in my opinion better than sets priced much higher  .

the adjustability of this set is endless , a con for some , and the input options are numerous  .

i have an upconverting dvd player and movies look great  .

i have yet to utilize the full 1080p potential of this set but have been more than impressed so far with over the air 1080i  .

i just wish cnet would review this baby to see what they think optimal picuture settings are  .

the sound strip speaker is actually more than acceptable for long periods of viewing , a rarity in flat panel tv's .

i had been vacillating over sony and samsung for many weeks trying to be patient about selecting the right balance of quality vs  .

cost  .

(sony's are clearly overpriced in my opinion)  .

as i walked past this unit , it really caught my eye  .

it is showing a regular dvd upscaled to 1080p and it looked like i is actually looking through the camera lens in person  .

i is amazed  .

as this unit had been released only a few weeks before (either late april or early may 2007) , i asked the retail salesperson about the unit and he is pleasantly suprised with the picture quality as well  .

he went so far to put it in the top 3 units they purvey at the moment since placing the set on the wall and plugging in hd cable broadcast , i cannot get away from the tv  .

the color and contrast is so vivid its unlike anything i have seen before at home  .

this emerging hd technology is going to take tv viewing at home a whole new tier  .

lastly , for some reason , plasma's tend to be 42 and lcd 40 in this size range  .

i don't like plasma's because they are heavy and they run too hot (just my opinion  .

) the 40 lcd's seemed too small for my room and 46 too big if you are burdened with the same dilemma and are sold on lcd , this is one of the few high quality 42 lcd tvs at the moment  .

something i was not really concerned with but pleasantly suprised to learn is the sound quality as well  .

its very crisp and clean  .

for the $1600 i paid for this unit , i could not be more pleased  .

the one that i have has no 1080p , but it is still awesome in my opinion , as i have no 1080p devices anyway .

i've had this tv about a week , and i love it  .

the 1080p picture with ps3 games or blu    ray disks is simply amazing  .

the onkyo speaker (long and narrow) on the bottom of the set sounds great (for a tv speaker)  .

standard channel reception is excellent , but the hd stuff is where this set really shines  .

i'm sure a sony bravia or samsung would probably match or exceed this set , but at under $1500 , you cannot beat it  .

blacks are black , and colors are vivid  .

there may be some ghosting when the scene pans quickly , i have not really noticed it much at all  .

my wife and i are extremely pleased with our purchase .

i just purchased this tv from hh gregg for $1485  .

00 two weeks ago and i love it  .

the colors are great , high def looks awesome , digital cable from time warner looks good also  .

i watched the stanley cup playoffs and love it  .

standard def looks better than most tv , s i have seen  .

it even has a swivel base  .

and colormaster feature where you can adjust several different setting for each individual color that this tv has  .

(i don , t see any tv (lcd) with this  .

the sound from this tv is very good  .

the only thing is i , am spoiled from getting clear standard def picutres from my analog tv for many years and have to get use to the lcd standard picture  .

the only question i had is i sometimes get a fluid look on the tv with different show but the cable company said thats in all lcd , you have to adjust the settings so you don , t see it as much  .

also to adjust the picutre they said always use the high def with your local news cause thats live don , t go by movies and taped shows as much get this tv its worth the $1700  .

00 they are asking at other stores .

my next tv will definitelty be a toshiba .

have experimented with several different connections for this tv  .

the green tinge mentioned by others is a function of the connection and the cable box  .

experienced green tinge with component connections , experienced the same effect on my westinghouse hdtv  .

switched to hdmi connection and the green tinge sd picture is typical of tv's i've seen  .

picture controls could be a little more sensitive updated  .

on jan 31 , 2009  .

the toshiba regza 42hl167 is a 42    inch , liquid crystal display television is by fair the best tv you can get in this price range  .

granted there are several better tv's that cost more but i could not be any happier with this tv and what it has done for my movie viewing , video game playing experience  .

add a hd or blueray player your surround sound setup and your at the movies  .

wheres the popcorn  .

great picture  .

great price  .

had it for almost a year now and finally hooked up a real 1080p source  .

bought a ps3 for the blu    ray capability and i have to say that it is stunning  .

even upsampling standard dvds on the ps3 look 10x better than they ever did highly recommended  .

i matched this model to the toshiba hd    a20 hd    dvd player and the picture is awesome  .

the picture coming from the satilite and cable were not as good of a quality and somewhat grainy at times  .

however , adjustment of the picture quality controls corrected that problem  .

i got this 42hl167 from tiger    direct for $1 , 299 , and what a deal it is  .

easy menu for setups as well  .

you cannot go wrong with this model .

this toshiba is an exchange from a previous lemon of mine which is 30 philips 720p with glossy panel that samsung's latest 1080p has now which makes the colors stand out like a plasma , so i got the toshiba 42hl167 and well the tv is pretty impressive in other aspects such as color master which lets you adjust individual colors red , green , blue , yellow , cyan , and magenta but not only the brightness of each color you have hue and saturation to play with as well you also have options for the lamp brightness , sharp used to do that on there earlier lcd models but have minimized options  .

the black levels is probably one of  .

the best i've seen with the none glossy panel  .

another key feature is wall bracket cost , since it has the shorter width on the back where the brackets goes you spend less on the articulating arm , you save half on the mount , if your not wall mounting it the tv has a cool swivel base  .

design is very outstanding most tvs such as samsung looks like its a plastic toy inputs are very cool 3hdmi and pc input is what i always wanted , i also bought the toshiba a    20 so i'm running hd all the way with hd cable as well , i also calibrated the tv with dve hd dvd which looks awesome when i play my movies but still need to adjust for hd cable watching since its not the same quality picture , one thing you will most notice is theres to much yellow so i would turn that down  .

cost is good and even though i really liked my phillips and the  .

samsung that matched the panel i felt this is a good purchase especially after seeing how many samsung , lg , sony , and phillips , are being returned for dislikes and defects , the only other tv i is considering is the new sharp models  .

i actually sell tv's so i've seen what tv's are being returned and which are staying home .

bought this set at the beginning of aug'07 , had to return it because of a uniformity issue (ghost bars) when panning left/right  .

also had a slight green push in the greyscale , making shadows , hair lines , and low light scenes have green where none should be  .

got an exchange for another 42hl167 set and no real problems are evident  .

have not seen any green push as of yet , and the ghost bars seem to be gone as well  .

there are some uniformity issues , but they are so slight that they're hardly noticeable i'm using an upconverting 1080p dvd player and movies look excellent on this set  .

also any hd on cable is fantastic , the picture is one of the better in its class  .

sd is average at best , but all hdtvs have issues with sd content  .

the 3 hdmi ports is a great feature , allowing for greater expandability in the future  .

overall this is a great set at usually a great price point  .

i would definitely recommend to the set to others  .

just be wary that any set can have its own unique set of issues  .

if there is a problem on any set that you buy , be sure to use the 30 day exchange , do not hesitate , be sure when buying an hdtv that you are fully satisfied , thats the bottom line .

i had a cheaper 42 high definitition tv that is very disappointing due to the poor picture qualiry  .

when i replaced it with the 42hl167 , i could not believe how sharp and vivid the picture was  .

however , this quickly fades when you view the set off center  .

at an angle , the picture of the cheaper set actually looked better  .

a problem when the family wants to watch tv  .

by the way , the swivel base helps compensate for this  .

great universal remote .

keep in mind these tvs are hd tv's meaning that they are made for watching hd programs  .

if you dont have hd the picture will not look good  .

i would recomend this unit to someone who wanted 1080p and did not want to pay and arm and a leg like i commented on earlier the color on this unit is amazing , but the blacks are horrid  .

and on non hd feeds its really grainy .

the tv itself is great  .

i purchased it december 2007  .

everything is going great and we were enjoying it a lot until the power supply went out in the tv (march 2008)  .

we contacted the store we purchased the tv from and they sent someone out to take a look  .

after confirming the power supply needed to be replaced they told us that it would be june or july before they could get the parts  .

the repair company and the store we purchased the tv from both said that having the customer contact toshiba directly usually results in a better response on getting parts we contacted toshiba directly , they assigned a rep to our problem , and we have not heard anything back since  .

each time we call toshiba to get an update on the parts for our tv , they tell us that the rep has all the information and will call us back  .

they refuse to let us speak with the rep they assigned to the case , and they refuse to let us speak with a manager at toshiba's call center when asked why it takes so long to get parts for a new model tv , the response from toshiba was , well , we make a lot of tvs and some of these parts come from overseas i have had other toshiba products and been very happy with them , but this experience with their customer service has turned me off of purchasing toshiba products in the future the real kick in the pants we even purchased the extended warranty when we bought the tv and it has done absolutely nothing for us the tv is really nice when it's working but for the last month or so all i've had is a big dead black square hanging over my fireplace .

this could have been a great t  .

, instead it's a great green t  .

after numerous attempts at different settings i am convinved this t  .

has a problem  .

in dark areas especially black and grey shadows , walls , asphault , water , etc you will see a green hue to everything  .

after a while this becomes very distracting  .

others have reported this same problem as well and as of now nothing has been done to correct this  .

very unfortunate , toshiba could of had a winner instead they offer the jolly green giant .

this is my third 42 lcd in one month  .

after a bottom of the line toshiba 42hl57 with a very bad screen (big white spots) and a sharp lc42d62u wich refuses to accept the hdmi signal from my cable box (along with several dead pixels right in the center of the screen) , i bought this regza toshiba 42hl167 one week ago  .

and i will return it tommorow most of the time , this tv displays a very greenish picture that i'm unable to adjust  .

sd tv programs and 480p dvds are the worst cases , but even my xbox 360 via components at 1080i shows a hugely prominent green tone  .

how come i have none of all these problems with my one year old 32 panasonic tc32lx60 lcd tv  .

everything looks perfect on this little tv my 42 lcd journey is over  .

i will return this toshiba tommorow for a 42 panasonic 42px77 plasma .

i paid $1400+ back in 2007 for the tv after a lot of research  .

however , the tv started malfunctioning recently  .

the repair bill is estimated at $800 and the repairman said that if it were a samsung , it would only have been $200  .

(some sort of main board  .

) he said this is the case with almost all toshiba's    parts are expensive it never had an exceptional picture  .

i purchased a cheap $800 philips to replace it and i am stunned at the difference already    much more crisp and colorful on the plus side , the toshiba had superior movement and a better remote , but the colors were way off no matter what tweaking i did  .

not worth it  .

i'd recommend a different brand and model .

ok let me start off with saying that i have tried off brand tv companies for lcd's and as you hear you get what you pay for so i decided to try toshiba for a well known brand because i have a laptop by them that is awsome but the tv not so much  .

this tv is a green monster  .

i understand that lcd tvs have a problem with black tones as compared to plasma but man this thing looks like someone filled it with green water  .

it is terrible and the generic menu cannot tune this to go away  .

also the picture looks like what you see when you open your eyes under water when running 480i devices and regular cable into it  .

its not even worth watching  .

another complaint of mine is that the viewable angle of the tv is very narrow  .

so plan on putting this one smack dab infront of your toilet in the bathroom because in a big room it would be useless  .

also the finish is all but flawless  .

i thought the marks in it were just from the packing but they are actually in the paint  .

and for those of you who think samsung and other big name brands are overpriced and the same quality as this hunk of garbage you are nuts i returned this green giant for a samsung 40inch that totally blows this waste of material out of the water  .

i know negative reviews are minimum on this tv and i took that into consideration when i bought it but trust me the ones that are , prove to be very true .

this tv should not have been allowed on the market  .

the picture is this grainy crackling mess that you'd expect from a cheap no    name brand tv  .

everything has this green hue to it along with 4 thick vertical black lines that appear in low light  .

very disappointing  .

this tv is beautiful  .

the picture is quite the opposite  .

everyone i showed it to agreed that it is terrible  .

i tried component video dvd on it and it still looked terrible  .

will be returning it for a panasonic plasma tomorrow .

i agree with the previous user absolutely terrible picture when watching regular tv  .

picture is very grainy  .

i had a 42 lg lcd hdtv but it had defect in power on/off  .

i thought i would be upgrading going to the toshiba but i'm taking this back to bestbuy today and getting another lg .

we want to hear from you  .

if you have been affected by the defect in the toshiba 42hl167 , 47hl167 or 52 hl167 please email me  .

the defect i am referring to is not being able to turn on the tv and experiencing the continuous little yellow light in the bottom right hand corner  .

i bought my tv 10/2007 and just finished paying it off  .

to my dismay the tv does not work  .

after calling toshiba customer service they simply passed it off as being out of warranty and to send it to an authorized toshiba service to get an evaluation  .

from the hundreds of blogs i have read , the issue seems to be the siene board (75007224 pc board assembly e0361 , sei)  .

the siene board ranges from $570    800  .

i paid $1500 for my defective tv and can not afford to drop another $500    800 when the same tv ranges from $950    1000 now please email me at defectivetoshibatv@yahoo  .

com if you have experienced this same problem  .

i would like to know how much you originally paid for the tv , when you bought it , how long after you bought it did you experience the problem and how much it cost you to repair the tv  .

please share your story thanks for your comments ,  .

disappointed in toshiba  .

there is a problem with the turn on sequence  .

some time i've had to reset it and on other occasions i have to pull the plug from the wall to get the tv to turn on with audio and video  .

i've also had problems getting the unit into 16  9 aspect ration  .

this is not fun .

i hate to disagree with so many glowing reviews    but i am returning this regza after two weeks  .

i find the picture extremely grainy with the component input with few (jeopardy i  .

) exceptions  .

and unwatchable under other circumstances    with the quality worse than early 1970's tv sets with bleeding colors etc i even exchanged my hi    def cable box to see if that would clear things up    but no it looks like toshiba have put a million black dots on the screen to make it look 'sharper'  .

no thanks  .

regular tv watching is also as painful  .

but it does make a fantastic pc monitor  .

and i have not even mentioned how very hot the screen gets .

in addition to the lines , it loses the picture often when switching from sd to hd , needs to be unplugged and plugged back in  .

the lines have grown more and more solid  .

replacement parts are outrageously expensive (replacement board costs more than a new equivilant unit)  .

sound quality is bad , a theater system is a must for movies and sports  .

keep away from toshiba tv's  .

they are defective junk , and they know it but just do not care .

i bought this tv around 2 years ago  .

around 1 month ago , the tv just stopped working  .

before this , it would frequently shut    down and i'd get no video unless i unplugged it and plugged it back in  .

i could hear something reset inside when i'd unplug it and plug it back in  .

then , one day , it shut    down , and i unplugged it and plugged it back in and no power  .

i took it to a toshiba certified repair shop (affter calling their support for help) , their diagnostic of the problem is a bad sein board  .

it would cost $545 to fix it  .

almost as much as a brand new philips 42 inch lcd i just recently purchased for another room i contacted toshiba to ask for repair assistance , even just a discount on this part  .

they were not willing to help at all  .

i told them i would never but another toshiba product , and they said basically you'll have to do what you have to do terrible customer service  .

they obviously don't care about making their customers happy and producing a quality product that they'll stand behind beware of toshiba tv's  .

do not buy one , you'll be sorry  .
