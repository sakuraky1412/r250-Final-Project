 the staff at swissotel were not particularly nice .

 each time i waited at the counter for staff   for several minutes and then was waved to the desk upon my turn with no hello or anything, or apology for waiting in line .

 all staff members are very courteous and go the extra mile in meeting your needs during your stay .

 the staff was great and put us on the 30th floor with a view of the lake .

 the hotel was a bit busy during this weekend, but the staff did a great job of helping me with whatever i needed .

my only criticism would be that perhaps due to the size of the building and it was busy that staff appeared a bit impersonal .

 the hotel staff were professional, but the fornt desk was somewhat slow at check in .

 my father and i were in town for four days from los angeles to catch a game at wrigley stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services .

 instead we were offered a rude and incompetant staff, amateur and slow valet, over, priced internet, garage and fitness room access charges and an inept business office .

 room 1619 was a very nice room, had a great view, beds were soft and very nice to sleep in, tv was very nice, show was very nice, staff was awesome saw to every need i inquired about .

staffhas that midwestern charm .

 the staff is quite accommodating .

i was very impressed with this hotel and its staff .

 the rooms were great, the staff was excellent .

 very close to everything, or the front staff will hail a cab for you .

 you come to a place like trip advisor and it’s so, so hard to tell fact from fiction or even to tell whether or not someone was having a bad day when they arrived or left or whether or not a guest was rude him herself and thus caused the hotel staff to be standoffish or what .

 while we were there i would have to say i saw one or two people guests who were less than polite to the hotel staff .

 if you walk in feeling entitled with your nose up in the air like they owe you something, then i daresay you might find something to squawk about, but the hotel staff i encountered doesn’t sound anything like the staff some reviewers have mentioned .

thanks to the management and staff for our fabulous weekend .

 bell staff was attentive and available .

 from the moment we checked in, the staff was courteous and meet every need, including arranging for a crib for our daughter and making sure it was safely set up before leaving our room .

however, the staff was very friendly and helpful .

 the young lady that checked us in was very pleasant and i was very appreciative of the articulate directions given to us by one of the staff members .

 check, in and check, out were a breeze  , and the staff was just fine .

 my biggest complaint is i got used to the fairmont's treatment, the staff is very well trained to meet your every need and are over accomodating .

 all the staff at the hotel were the epitomy of politeness and professionalism .

 the staff was absolutely excellent = full service, from front desk, to health club attendants, to business center personnel .

 very classy entrance, nice staff .

 from checking to checking out, i loved the room and the staff .

 everything was wonderful, including the staff and service .

 now on the side of the service andstaff, there is a real &quot snobbish&quot  attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the swedish, germanprogeny of europe work at the hotel, except as luggagehandlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers .

 the front desk staff was friendly as well .

 the location of the hotel is also good and the staff seemed friendly .

the hotel seemed understaffed at the front desk as there was only one agent when i checked in .

 i thought that the concierge staff was ok, certainly not too pleasant, but adequate .

 of course i called downstairs and was put on endless hold due to them not being staffed sufficiently .

 it's a block away from the hyatt which i have also stayed at and isn't as nice as the swissotel but at least its better staffed .

 the worst were the clorox, like smell on that floor and the level of service provided by the staff .

 the staff is not helpful and sometimes hardly able to understand even a simple english sentence .

back in the room, the cleaning staff never made it there before 4pm in the afternoon, not very exciting when you have to spend a rainy weekend in the windy city !

 and due to the lack of a sign, you cannot indicate to the cleaning staff early in the day that the room is ready .
