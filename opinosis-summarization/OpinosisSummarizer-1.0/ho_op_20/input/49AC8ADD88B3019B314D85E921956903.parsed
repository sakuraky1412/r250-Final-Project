maybe/RB i/FW was/VBD having/VBG a/DT really/RB great/JJ day/NN that/IN i/FW did/VBD n't/RB actually/RB mind/NN or/CC made/VBD a/DT big/JJ fuss/NN about/IN it/PRP ,/, but/CC the/DT next/JJ day/NN ,/, i/FW felt/VBD the/DT sincerity/NN of/IN the/DT hotel/NN management/NN team/NN ,/, when/WRB they/PRP sent/VBD an/DT apology/NN letter/NN and/CC some/DT complimentary/JJ fruits/NNS and/CC wine/NN ./.

i/LS had/VBD reserved/VBN earlier/RBR that/IN my/PRP$ wife/NN would/MD be/VB staying/VBG as/RB well/RB ,/, but/CC when/WRB i/FW got/VBD to/TO the/DT room/NN ,/, there/EX were/VBD only/RB one/CD pair/NN of/IN slippers/NNS ,/, one/CD toothbrush/NN ,/, etc/FW ./.

you/PRP need/VBP to/TO use/VB your/PRP$ key/JJ card/NN to/TO access/VB the/DT elevators/NNS and/CC the/DT electricity/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT insert/NN location/NN is/VBZ at/IN an/DT angle/NN that/WDT 's/VBZ very/RB awkward/JJ ./.

they/PRP serve/VBP filipino/NN ;/: japanese/JJ in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN sashimi/NN -LRB-/-LRB- which/WDT by/IN the/DT way/NN ,/, has/VBZ the/DT freshest/JJS ingredients/NNS that/IN you/PRP can/MD really/RB taste/VB its/PRP$ freshness/NN -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC maki/NN ;/: chinese/JJ in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN dimsum/NN and/CC noodle/NN soups/NNS ,/, spanish/NNP in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN arroz/NN caldo/NN ,/, potatoes/NNS ,/, and/CC fritatas/NNS ;/: western/JJ with/IN bacon/NN and/CC sausages/NN ;/: healthy/JJ with/IN yogurt/NN ,/, oatmeal/NN ,/, fruits/NNS ,/, and/CC muesli/NNS ./.

the/DT staffs/NNS are/VBP very/RB friendly/JJ and/CC respectful/JJ ,/, and/CC will/MD assist/VB you/PRP to/TO the/DT best/JJS of/IN their/PRP$ abilities/NNS until/IN you/PRP are/VBP safe/JJ and/CC happy/JJ ./.

although/IN not/RB as/IN varied/VBN as/IN other/JJ hotels/NNS ,/, but/CC i/FW feel/VBP the/DT food/NN they/PRP serve/VBP is/VBZ enough/RB ./.

i/LS like/IN the/DT croissant/NN very/RB much/RB because/IN i/FW have/VBP tried/VBN many/JJ and/CC very/RB few/JJ can/MD make/VB it/PRP as/IN flaky/JJ ./.

the/DT bed/NN is/VBZ also/RB good/JJ ,/, nice/JJ ,/, comfortable/JJ ,/, enough/JJ pillows/NNS ,/, and/CC cozy/JJ blanket/NN ./.

everyone/NN from/IN the/DT reception/NN desk/NN to/TO the/DT toilets/NNS ,/, their/PRP$ bright/JJ smiles/NNS and/CC courteous/JJ hellos/NNS will/MD bright/JJ up/IN anyone/NN 's/POS day/NN ./.

got/VBD turned-off/NN at/IN the/DT start/NN because/IN of/IN bland/JJ food/NN and/CC very/RB slow/JJ check-in/NN ./.

they/PRP also/RB serve/VBP freshly/RB squeezed/VBN and/CC prepared/VBN juices/NNS ,/, while/IN serving/VBG the/DT tastiest/JJS breads/NNS in/IN town/NN ./.

i/LS was/VBD scheduled/VBN to/TO check-in/NN at/IN 2/CD pm/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB until/IN 4/CD +/CC pm/NN that/WDT i/FW got/VBD my/PRP$ room/NN ./.

i/FW enjoyed/VBN staying/VBG here/RB and/CC hope/VB to/TO have/VB the/DT chance/NN to/TO stay/VB again/RB ./.

the/DT room/NN service/NN and/CC housekeeping/NN were/VBD prompt/JJ and/CC friendly/JJ as/RB well/RB ./.

the/DT best/JJS thing/NN i/FW probably/RB like/IN in/IN this/DT hotel/NN is/VBZ the/DT service/NN ./.

the/DT room/NN is/VBZ spacious/JJ with/IN enough/JJ lamps/NNS to/TO brighten/VB it/PRP ./.

i/FW believe/VBP they/PRP are/VBP sincere/JJ in/IN making/VBG things/NNS right/RB and/CC they/PRP have/VBP earned/VBN my/PRP$ respect/NN ./.

the/DT breakfast/NN definitely/RB countered/VBD my/PRP$ bland/JJ lunch/NN the/DT day/NN before/RB ./.

breakfast/NN is/VBZ buffet-style/JJ and/CC is/VBZ good/JJ ./.

a/DT lot/NN of/IN choices/NNS might/MD not/RB be/VB always/RB be/VB good/JJ anyway/RB ./.
