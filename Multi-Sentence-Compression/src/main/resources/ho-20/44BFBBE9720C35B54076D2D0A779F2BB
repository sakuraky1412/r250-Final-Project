hard to find fault though - the hotel is where it is , the neighbourhood is what it is , the need to go to javits every day for 5 days was mine - but it could have helped if i did not have to pay twice what i would normally pay ( if i ever stay ) in a tiny 2-star hotel / motel in a dirty and unsafe part of a city.

a near 5* rate for a property barely reaching a 3* level , merely because it is close to javits ( 5min walk ) and all those who attend the events there from around the world would prefer to cut down on the cost and hassle of commute and stay in this place , is nothing but exploitation .

the neighbourhood ( west 39th street ) of the hotel is filthy with days of uncleared trash , unsafe for pedestrians with missing side-walks and several construction sites , squatting homeless people - especially for walking in the direction of javits ( which is the main idea of staying there in the first place ) .

the hotel did not promise much at reservation , except for complimentary breakfast and wi-fi and these promises were met in the hotel .

the lobby almost non-existent , the corridors barely 2-people wide , the bathroom quite basic - but i was prepared for all these , as i had read previous travellers ' reviews .
