as a regular visitor on business to north oxfordshire i usually stay at the excellent wroxton house hotel - which on this occasion was full .
this was a problem to me as there are virtually no decent places to stay in this area .
i discovered this place and was not expecting a lot .
driving round the location in the dark was no joke because following the signage you come to a junction - if only their small sign was illuminated then you would avoid turning left instead of right and hence doing another circuit - not to management , why not illuminate this sign or make it more visible ?
the place has all the feel of a golf club as opposed to a hotel , that it not a particularly bad thing but you need to be aware of it .
it is a golf club with rooms not a hotel with a golf club .
again poor signage means finding your room can be difficult as can returning to reception .
our room ( 33 ) was one of the most comfortable rooms i have ever stayed in ( much more so than wroxton ) - fully air conditioned but oh joy , you can open the window and get fresh air as well if you wish .
comfy bed with great pillows all in all no complaints at all .
breakfast is served in what is more like a university refectory than a hotel restaurant with its tiled floor and . . .

breakfast is served in what is more like a university refectory than a hotel restaurant with its tiled floor and formica topped tables - this is not a criticism as some will prefer this .
food was fine and staff very attentive and pleasant .
all in all first class - and if they come up with a good local corporate rate like wroxton - then who knows i could be a regular.
