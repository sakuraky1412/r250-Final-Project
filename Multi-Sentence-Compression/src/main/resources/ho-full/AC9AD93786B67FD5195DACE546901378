i read some bad reviews here , but i dont agree with them .
this is a really nice property , they have to cater to the masses they have tons of people going in and out of here so you cant expect exceptional service in vegas unless you are spending 500 a night at the mandarin oriental , or four seasons .
i paid $ 37 dollars a night .
they get you with a resort fee still only $ 65 for the night .
their casino is not very smokey , they have a great night club , its for the younger or young minded , not for the old foggies .
they have decent restaurants , but you have the monorail at this hotel so you can get a one or two day pass and visit anywhere you would like on the strip , this is at the north end of the strip , so not as much foot traffic on this end .
they have two nice pools , the main pool is 21 and up the one on the rooftop is ok for families but its definitely a couples hotel .
a lot of models , and young couples , girls weekends , this is a good place for anybody that likes to party .
if you like buffets and shows then you should stay at the mirage or mgm .
their player card is confusing as it doesnt sync with your online profile and your card profile .
its called the code .
its a mystery on how to get . . .

its a mystery on how to get comps , i dont really know if their players card is anything to brag about , but all and all it was a great experience i would go back for $ 65 again and again.
