No problem with quality, performance, etc .
t anywhere close to 3 series on many facets, namely performance, but sadly to say, in others, it surpasses .
Performance is outstanding, more like a sports car than a coupe .
Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .
Engine performance is very lacking .
It has room, performance, good MPG for its size and excellent reliability .
Overall performance is good but comfort level is poor .
If you want sports sedan handling and performance, then pay much more and buy a true sports sedan !
The performance is incredible !
I'm impressed with the performance as well as efficiency gains .
Features, quality, reliability, and performance, at a price no other car maker can touch .
It fits right , is fun to drive, great stereo, fuel economy, performance .
There seem to be so many components that enter into the VCM that performance can vary WIDELY from car to car .
My my, I have never experienced such smooth performance, stability, pick, up, mileage and comfort that I am enjoying with my new 2008 Honda Accord .
The previous models were boring both aestically and performance wise .
Honda has outdone itself on styling and performance .
Still enjoy interior and exterior styling as well as overall performance and handling .
I researched many other makes and models but for the performance, quality, and style, the accord won hands down for cars under $32,000 .
After tracking almost 2 months of research on American and Japanese mid, size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety ,  Honda Accord and Toyota Camry .
It does not diminish the performance of the car, it is just annoying .
