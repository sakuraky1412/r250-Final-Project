Pros:. If you need your PC and GPS, DeLorme is the best.. 
Cons:. Not intuitive.. 
Summary:. Most of the complaints I have seen in here are from a lack of RTFM. Now that I have read the manual everything works very well. Beats the hell outa the competition. Works flawlessly for me throughout the USA from a vehicle and from flying. The product is dynamite, the documentation and learning sucks. Oh well, I am a thoroughly happy customer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Yes, it is an inexpensive (not cheap) unit. The ability to run from a PDA or a laptop is a big + in my book. With WAAS enabled, the directions and tracking were right on most of the time. It was good enough for me to make a coast-to-coast run, without a p. 
Cons:. At times the tracking was a bit off, but never more than a couple of hundred feet, quite sufficient for me to figure out where I was. Buying the separate handheld software I thought was kind of dumb. Why not give the consumer a choice when buying the hard. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and inexpensive. 
Cons:. Requires Laptop connection.. 
Summary:. We used Earthmate on a trip from SC to Oregon, and it was simply great! Only once did I need to look at another map, and this was for a tiny mountain road in NC. My daughter was surprised that we drove right up to her front door in West Linn. OR, with no extra help. And when we were almost there, a lady's voice came on to tell us. where to turn. It was soooo easy!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Super quick to lock onto sats. even in my office window. Sturdy contrstruction, already droped it a few times and still no problems. Works great with my laptop or my Ipaq.. 
Cons:. It's a little difficult to mount in my truck, just sits on the dash.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unit is small, easy to set up and comes with decent bundled software. Have used it for finding private homes to tracking flight in airplane. I have been very satisfied.. 
Cons:. Cord from unit to laptop is a little bit of a bother. Some views are better than others and not totally clear in instructions of how to switch.. 

$$;
Pros:. GPS works well, gernarllay receives well. SA 2004 accurate where it's been updated. However, some major newer highways still reflect the proposed rather than the "as-built" route. Works well with other DeLorme map products. 
Cons:. SA 2004 places very high demands upon CPU when zoomed out to a wider view, when there is much stop and roll traffic, or after several hours of use. Generally cause the program to stop working and may require a forced reboot (pulling the battery on a lapt. 

$$;
Pros:. Tiny, small and portable. USB connection for true Plug 'n' Play. Inexpensive, easy to use and cross device friendly with optional cables. Easy to see status LEDs. Bluetooth made real cordless connection. Great power management with the Bluetooth PowerPack. 
Cons:. Expect the bundled software, I don't see too much cons about this product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap solutions for poor people.. 
Cons:. Need to be improve software. Does not have an automatic back-on-track feature. If you lost in middle of trip, it's try to get back on pre-calculate route,does not give new route from where you are.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive, accurate GPS and accurate map, many Points of Interests (POIs). 
Cons:. User iterface could be improved. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate &#38; fast. Reasonably priced... can't get lost with it!. 
Cons:. Software is difficult to use if accustomed to Microsoft style interface &#38; commands.. 

$$;
Pros:. The USB Earthmate, with WAAS, plots accurately on accurate maps. It performed accurately under 3D Topo quads. The USB GPS unit is fine which Delorme products can read, directly.. 
Cons:. In Delorme's recommended config, Street Atlas was HORRIBLY inaccurate, plotting my house address upwards of 1000 feet off. No alignment appears possible and this should drive you fair-thee-well nuts navigating unknown city blocks. MS Streets &#38; Trips p. 

$$;
Pros:. Provides voice commands and responds to voice commands.. 
Cons:. Maps entirely inaccurate, tells you to turn the wrong way on one way streets, tells you to turn left on a bridge into a river, frequently fails to give the most direct or quickest route. On cloudy days has a slow accuire time. Does not have an automatic. 

$$;
Pros:. I liked the idea of being able to connect to my LapTop in the car... 
Cons:. I never saw so many wrong directions in my life.. I am the worlds worst Boyscout. I am quite directionally challenged . I say that because if you don't have some idea about where you are or want to go, the DeLorme Earthmate GPS will not be of help.. 
Summary:. I have never seen so many mistakes do to what I think has to be none update of data to the system. I don't know what else it could be. I have been traveling down a highway that thankfully I knew where I was going and have the Earthmate tell me to take the next possible turn and essentially take me around a mile block in the country just to bring me back to the very highway I was on. Oh, and then try to do the same thing in another couple of miles.. This was more than a one time experience... Don't buy it... 

$$;
Pros:. Great for laptop users. 
Cons:. Software has a lot of bugs.. 
Summary:. I give this product a 4 because the software still needs a lot of work. In my opinion the accuracy is way off from what you see in your screen. Voice feature is nice, but sometimes it wont't work if you have a lot of background noise. The autoroute is ok but don't add any stop points in your destination, it will have you going in circles if you take a wrong turn. Overall the software is ok if you can't afford a Street Pilot or Magelllan. Otherwise I would stick with a real GPS harware if I were you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well with my PC and has been very helpful in areas where I don't know my way around.. 
Cons:. Requires someone to operate it unless you set up voice operation. The battery power pack worked once and then needed repair. It was beyound the warranty so I did the repair myself. Switch is so cheaply made that it has to fail very soon and Delorme doe. 

$$;
Pros:. its not expensive and is pretty small. 
Cons:. i had a hard time getting this device to get signal, i couldnt find a few address's in the atlas...just get a real gps device no matter how much, at least u know u dont have to connect it to your lop top and probably get into an accident by looking at you. 

$$;
Pros:. Not a darn thing.. 
Cons:. 1. This thing can't find my home address, but a 10 yr old vers of MS Streets and Trips can.. 2. Difficult to use.. 3. The maps look like they are 20 yrs old.. 
Summary:. Don't waste your money; buy MS Streets and trips.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is yellow, thus making it easy to find, and is of sufficient mass so as to hold my papers secure in moderately windy conditions.. 
Cons:. It doesn't work with non-Delorme mapping applications under Windows 7. Delorme isn't going to produce a Windows 7 serial emulator driver for this product, effectively abandoning it for Mappoint and other Microsoft mapping apps under Windows 7.. 
Summary:. I wish I could make all the rating stars be empty. I am dumping this receiver in favor of one that will work with Microsoft applications, specifically Mappoint 2009, under Windows 7. If Delorme is unable or unwilling to produce a serial emulator driver that will make this receiver work under Windows 7 then I will abandon Delorme as well. If Delorme won't support me then I won't support Delorme. *** for tat.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good looking, compact, cannot connect to street and trips. 
Cons:. Useless mapping(boundle with SA 2005). Slow startup, High power consumption, Lower receiver sensibility than handhold GPS. Breadcrumble display track poorly. 
Summary:. Bought from Office Depot with 129 bucks. I want return it when I found it is mere a hightech toy. But it is already out the 1 month.. It works at home but not as good as driving, it cannot lock to satellite in time before I make wrong turn. Why I didnot start it earlier, Save notebook bettery not allow me work in that way. (I use it with HP zv5000 us).. It comes with SA2005, which is so poor:. 1. No detail on most of the area I interested in (but MS ST does).So it come with feature that you can add street and route if you want. I can add 10 streets in my home town but you cannot add every downtown street you just drive by. I have to work on MS ST to find the point coords then enter into SA, so I would not miss the point too far. Why not use it with ST, because the GPS has difficulty to connect ST though both manufactures say they are nmea 0183 compliance.. 2. All your map mark is not searchable.. 3. Confusible conception on Add/Insert Via/Stop..... 4. Access manu command is hard. Most of them are level 2 even 3 and 4. You can eazily get lost from where you are come from. I tried rember the back manu button but soon forget it in your next trip if you use it once in a month.. 5. Forget the voice command function it is for fun. And premature. (This feature really attract me before I bought but soon you'll find it is useless).. 6. Poor position accuracy and data filtering: Delorme display track called breadcrumble, it is too wide and will interfere your reading of highway switch. MS ST looks better than Delorme SA. Stay somewhere for while, ST has much less fast position data drafting.. Recommand spending little bit more rather than waste money in this way. Bought Handhold GPS+ MS ST. Though it is not that good in portability. But it is real tool to support your trip. And it can support you biking as well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive, OK GPS. 
Cons:. GPS turns on and off at will so you have to constantly pay attention to where you are. Does not track to mapped roadways, which is not a big deal in urban areas but if you are in an unfamiliar in town area it is really confusing. The maps cannot locate a. 

$$;
Pros:. Receiver unit is nice and compact. It acquires a signal quickly.. 
Cons:. Mapping is very inaccurate with numerous mislabeled roads. Interface is not at all intuitive and frustrating. I returned the unit after "fighting" with it for 10 days and will wait to see the new Garmin 18. I previewed it's city select maps for my area an. 

$$;
Pros:. Rugged, waterproof.. 
Cons:. Web server is constantly S L O W; Tech support is incompentent and non-responsive.. 
Summary:. I bought the DeLorme EarthMate GPS primarily to generate track logs so I could GPS-tag my nature photos. Although it requires more steps than I'd like, it does work fine for that purpose. It is too slow to use for automotive directions, but would work fine to figure out where you are if you get lost.. When I got the unit, I visited DeLorme's website to download a firmware update plus an update for the Topo software that's included with the unit. It took hours and hours of unsuccessful attempts before I could download the files. Note I have cable internet and typically I get hundreds of megabits-per-second download speed. The entire DeLorme website was equally slow: typically 5 minutes (by the clock) for the home page to load, and similar results for other pages. This makes it very annoying and practically useless to use their web site for firmware updates, software updates, tech support, and to exchange information with other users via their online forums.. At first DeLorme tech support tried to help me via phone and email, but it was clear they didn't have a clue about the problem. They thought it was at my end, but a poll of DeLorme users showed 26% found the DeLorme site "extraordinarily slow." Three weeks later DeLorme has not fixed the problem, and for nearly that long they have stopped replying to my emails asking for an update on the issue.. I would encourage potential buyers of GPS units to look elsewhere, or at least try logging onto the DeLorme website to see if you can load their pages in a reasonable time. You might also email their tech support and see what the response is like, before plunking down hundreds of dollars for a unit that is supposed to include support as well as firmware- and software-upgrades but which virtually fails to provide those things.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive. 
Cons:. Inaccurate, not easy to use. 
Summary:. Having just received the Earthmate GPS LT-20 &#38; Street Atlas USA 2008, I installed the software, waited 5 minutes for a sat link and then found that streets in the area that had been in existence for greater than 7 years were not included in the "updated maps". POI information was consistently incorrect in location and in actual businesses no longer in business. Although it was inexpensive and should have warned me, the name DeLorme clouded my better judgement. Never again!. 

$$;
Pros:. software loads easy. 
Cons:. I up graded from 2004 to 2005, but still has basic flaws like telling you to turn onto one way street in the wrong direction. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice maps . . . if you use a laptop computer operated by a knowledgable passenger. For the price , tho old addage applies . "You get what you pay for ". 
Cons:. Requires the seperate use of a laptop computer or PDA such as palm organizer. Laptop gives nice imagery, LAptop resolutiuon forces the operator to use magnifying glasses. Pda screen resolutions are insufficient to make positive identification of target. 

$$;
Cons:. Distance navigation is off many times. By this software, my house and work places are more than 300 ft. off. The re-route after a bad turn is almost un-usable. Why can't they get the nice voice to be more informative. The voice also needs to get together. 

$$;
Pros:. Hardware.... 
Cons:. Software is terrible.... 
Summary:. The unit will lock onto the satellite and hold it very well, but that is where the useful life of the Earthmate ends.. If you make a wrong turn, forget it, you are now lost. The software has no ability to automatically re-route you, and the "back on track" feature is worthless. Make a wrong turn, find a place to stop, re-set your entire route, and then maybe, just maybe you will find your way.. The software will have you on a major highway, it will have you exit, make four or five turns, and then get right back on the same highway that it had you exit.. The software refers to every road by the unpublished name of the road. Quite often that means taking an exit without knowing for sure it is the right one.. Often times the commands for which way to turn arrive after you have already had to make the decision. And even though the software shows you are going the wrong way, it will often times continue to direct you as if you are on the right road. So you will need to pay attention visually as well.. Any exit with an A or B will come out of the unit as take exit 17aaaaabbbbbb.. It will tell you to go north, when the exit is east and west. Or east when the exit is north and south, and so on.. Bear left or right means continue straight.. You should get the point, and not get the Earthmate, it is a long way from real world use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gps reciever is great. 
Cons:. How do I get the reciever working with MS streets &#38; Trips. 
Summary:. The reciever works great however the map software is useless. Unless you think GPS should get you within a 1/2 mile of your destination, take you on shortcuts that are 4-wheel drive trails, send you on roads that don't exist, take you 5-miles out of the way because a hywy exit that has been there for 30 years doesn't exist, or have you sitting at an intersection wondering what way to turn because the actual intersection in no way resembles the map and it doesn't matter because you are plotted a block away anyhow. DON'T BUY IT! I've never made so many U-Turns or 3-Point Turns in my life until I started using Delorme software. I'm just trying to figure out how to get the earthmate reciever to work with MS Streets &#38; Trips. I can't get MS streets and trips to recognize the earthmate reciever. If anyone can help me on that e-mail me redwood39@hotmail.com I think I have to reset the baud rate but don't know where to do it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Software, Good Size, Easy to use. 
Cons:. Will not stay on. 
Summary:. This unit has a cheap on/off switch. I think the switch broke the first time I turned it on because it worked great that first time. Thereafter, I had to keep restarting the powerpack and therefore, my PDA in order to sync them up.. Because of this bad switch, each time I hit a bump while driving, or walked over a rough patch of land, it simply shuts itself off.. And all of the great software in the world cannot overcome a unit that will not stay on.. Delorme offered to replace the unit - which is out of warrenty - at a cost of 90 percent of the original cost. They also informed me that the newer units have a different type of switch. This let me know that they recognized the problem and I am just the poor slob who is out of a hundred bucks or so for a defective device.. Fortunately for me, I have access to a soldering iron and a fairly steady hand so maybe I can repair the unit.. Stay away!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. fairly quick lockin small with belt clip bluetooth connectivity good. 
Cons:. with the bluetooth powerpack on the unit would not lock in any satellites. Have had two units and neither bluetooth feature worked. Trying to get Delorme to respond to my last email for refund. 

$$;
Pros:. works with Palm PDAs. 
Cons:. So far received two different units neither worked with bluetooth on. Both worked with direct cable connect. Owned them two months, used them 2 days.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive (cheap).. 
Cons:. The DelOrme never knew where it was. Fortunately, we weren't really dependent upon the unit during our runs, but were checking its alleged accuracy. For example: While driving on a US highway for about a half hour, the unit kept prompting me that I was "1.
