the food was generally very good though the breakfast was a bit disappointing as expected a bit more choice of fruit on the buffet , croissants were not at all good - ask for honey as was n't visible and is very good indeed .
it sounds very ungrateful because the `` room '' - large and outside spacious was very luxurious with glorious views but goodness its a trek up lots [ 72 i think ] of very steep steps !
they have a great policy though of moving you around the property for dinner so one night we had dinner on our own by the pool [ wonderfully sweet lobster - perfect ] and another on the beach with our feet in the sand and candlelight -a bit windy but still a lovely idea and much appreciated .
this was the most `` hotel '' like place we stayed on our trip along the coast and islands of tanzania and was very comfortable not least because we were upgraded , very kindly , to hill house 1 .
there is quite a bit of monkey activity around and bush babies but the best was the 3ft long monitor lizard near the beach hut .
whilst the massage itself was ok the whole experience was not at all good and i have had massages in many places all over the world .
wine here is good and the serengeti shiraz definitely worth trying as very nice .
however , it did n't detract from a very nice stay here .
she just left the room and that was it .
the massage was not , in my view , very professional .
