overall , it was an excellent value and we found the location great for us -- not too far from the beaches and coast , easy to get to highway 5 to head to la or san diego , and there are a few large shopping complexes with restaurants nearby .
highly recommend this hotel for its value and what it offers ; might reconsider another place if it 's a popular holiday weekend and tons of kids with parents in tow ( that 's the way it looks rather than parents keeping their kids in check ) heading to disneyland are staying here .
our second floor room had a spacious king bed and since it is a new ( open < 1 year ) hotel , everything in the rooms and its facilities is spic and span clean .
as we stayed on a holiday weekend ( july 4th ) , many children and large families were there on the first few days .
on tuesday morning , most people already checked out and the breakfast room was a calmer experience .
we used the gym-max of 10 people it said , but we were always the only ones there .
the pool is a tad small , but it 's indoors and probably heated .
it will probably have lots of business people during the week and tourists on the weekends with their nightly rates .
we opted to use the stairs more often than the elevator since it was faster -- the stair hallways have that new plaster smell that i imagine will fade as time passes .
yes , the location near business complexes and not the beaches lends itself to free parking , but most other oc hotels charge for parking even if they 're nowhere near major attractions .
