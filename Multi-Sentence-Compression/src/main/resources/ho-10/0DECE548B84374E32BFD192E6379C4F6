whilst the fyffe suite is fantastic and spacious , at nzd 600+ for that room ( although we paid nzd 465 in line with aston suite ) it is around nzd 200 per night too expensive looking at other local accommodation , when quality of finish , decor etc are taking into consideration .

this is a beautiful lodge and if location and road noise are not key drivers for you , chris and colin will look after you.
my partner and i stayed at the lodge for one night recently , out of an original booking of 3 nights .
