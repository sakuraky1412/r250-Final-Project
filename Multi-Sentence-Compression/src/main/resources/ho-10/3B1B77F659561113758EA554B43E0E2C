three nights in a row we had stayed at la quintas and this one was by far the most expensive , noisy , and less pet friendly ( gravel pet area , no grass spot to do business ) .
we took our things up to our room and it was here i found out my pups are scared of elevators and had to hold them tight in my arms .
we then took them outside to the `` pet area '' it was about to rain again and it was all gravel , no grass !
our room was on the second floor , the waterslide entrance was on the top floor and you could hear the water and kids screaming all the way down up until we fell asleep from fatigue around midnight .
we got there on wednesday night and as soon as we saw the packed parking lot we knew it was going to be noisy for a wednesday night .
breakfast was delicious as always filling us up and fueling us for another long day on the road headed to othello , washington .
all my husband and i wanted ( and 2 road weary chihuahuas ) was a quiet place to sleep and get out of the bad weather .
it took them awhile to go but they did and we went back to our room and ordered a pizza .
we found it , ate , then got out before the kids woke up .
even the breakfast room was located inside the area where the kids ended up splashing and yelling at the end of the slide .
