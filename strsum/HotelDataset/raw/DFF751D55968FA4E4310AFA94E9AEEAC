the bristol is in a great location , easy to walk to various sites , restaurants ( these are the only positives ) .
the hotel 's brochure states that the rooms have been renovated and are sound proof .
our room had very damaged particle board furniture , dirty curtains , a worn out bedspread , tiles were falling off the bath surround , and the mattress was awful ( it felt like a metal belgian waffle ) .
the hotel is booked by school groups so beware of noisy teenagers running through the halls , slamming doors , yelling etc , so needless to say the rooms are not sound proof ( which we thought was a strange claim to make ) and you will hear your neighbors .
when we complained regarding the screaming teenagers and and constant slamming door noise , the staff refused to do anything for us .
the hotel was not full and they could have easily moved us , we were very disappointed with the awful customer service .
we 're still not sure why the hotel would place other guests near a school group .
at the time of our trip march 2009 , the hotel listed itself as a three star ( as it was also listed on trip advisor ) and they charged a three star price .
the hotel truly is a two star and is over priced compared to other two star hotels nearby .
if you do not have to stay in avignon , try arles for better hotel value and take the train in for your visit . . .
