0 out of 5 stars gives strange directions, july 6, 2009

when it comes to directions, i'm horrible .

directions routing are perfect .

directions were easy to see and understand .

spoken directions are crystal clear .

my new garmin 255w had very easy set up, accurate directions to locations, user friendly unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .

the directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .

several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .

it loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when i miss a turn .

some of the verbal directions :

so, although the nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, i can look at the screen to see the exit i need to take .

no more stopping at so and so gas stations for directions .

the voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .

you also get upscale features like spoken directions including street names and programmable pois .

but for the most part, we find that the garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .

there are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even australian, american and british english .

it was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .

garmin's nuvi 255w   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .
