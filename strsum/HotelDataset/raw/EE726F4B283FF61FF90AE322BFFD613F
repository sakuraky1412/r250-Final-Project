we were very happy with location ( korea town ) .
we received friendly welcome , after rather tortuous journey from uk .
room small but guess most in ny are , tidy and clean and good strong shower .
breakfast ( as some reviewers have said ) can be a bit of a scrum as the room is small but choose your time and it is really well provisioned and good helpful staff on hand .
it makes for a great start .
the complaints are two - only two lifts means you can wait some time for moving around the building ( we were on 13th floor ) and two days out of four there was really loud drilling from below between about 4pm and 6pm - made time spent in room impossible , one day i had gone back with headache and needed rest before going out to theatre and second night had carnegie hall tickets .
the noise was impossible to bear - when i called i was told it was refurb work on 11th floor and it would last until 5:15 'ish it did n't !
it lasted until 6pm .
i spoke to reception agian and whilst i was offered chance of room move the next day with only short time in ny that meant a lot of hassle .
i really think i should have been told on check-in and in fact question whether the room on floor directly above work should have been let .
i was sorry they had not been . . .
