Pros:. Monitor has:. 1. No dead pixels.. 2. Works great on analog or digital inputs.. 3. Beautiful 1680X1050 resolution out of the box.. 4. Had the monitor for 1 year with no problems.. 5. Always on 24 X 7.. 
Cons:. No problems.. 
Summary:. I've used this with many different software packages and have had no problems with resolution, blurring or incompatibility. I want a second one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good build quality, reasonable speakers, large base, good height, BIG!. 
Cons:. none I can think of. 
Summary:. I had ordered a Samsung 206BW but after looking at the monitors I decided the build and looks of the viewsonic was better and the height was just right with a huge base on it. It also had speakers which are handy as if I want big volume then I put on the headphones.. The quality is faultless, although I don't have special tools to rate this stuff I can't see any evidence of uneven backlighting, or colours not matching properly. Video playback is pretty well perfect.. It is funny some reviews of this monitor say the quality is mediocre and the speakers are crap but I think that the monitors must vary as I have NO issues with mine.. I bought it in Perth for $360AUD which was pretty good.. I found the display is made by Chi Mei the same manufacter as the Samsung 206BW(we get Chi Mei here in Australia).. I have one big very sharp 22 inch monitor now and my old 17 inch TFT as a second monitor which is great.. I have to give the monitor a rating of 10 as I can't think of anything wrong with it.. Sorry.. 

$$;
Pros:. The size is amazing, and the price is finally low enough.. 
Cons:. None so far.. 
Summary:. I finally deceided to bite the bullet and get a new monitor. I'm glad I did. This thing is awesome. Not one dead pixel! I upgraded from a 17" Princeton LCD that I got at Costco 2 1/2 years ago. What a difference. It looks twice the size. The price was $299 at costco. Games are incredible. I was worried that my modest system would not be able to play anything at the native res. (1680x1050), but it works flawlessly. If you are a gamer, try Far Cry, HL2, Oblivion and you will be amazed. These games all have the widescreen option. By far the best upgrade I've made. It feels like a new computer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Color, 5ms performance, Size, Resolution,. 
Cons:. Little light bleeding, nothing major.. 
Summary:. I got this beauty from Costco today. And let me tell you this monitor is amazing. Considering the price of 350$ and what you really get. WOW!. I don't get people who complain about One dead pixel. SO WHAT??? Take it back and get a new one. No need to write horrible review just because you got one monitor with one dead pixel and now you bash on ViewSonic for making bad products.. In any case. This monitor is great. VIVID colors, Great Contrast, Absolutely amazing performance (no Ghosting) Awesome Finish, 3 Year warranty. 22 inch Wide Screen is BIG and you will never go back to 19inch after you see this one.. There is a little Bleeding when monitor is displaying all black colors, but its not major.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture Clarity, Menu Choices, Size of Screen. 
Cons:. Small menu buttons. 
Summary:. After replacing my 17" CRT with this monitor, I was initally blown away at the size of this monitor. It was like going from a 25" T.V. to a 45" plasma. The colors are excellent, and it has a menu to set the coloring for different things, e.g. scenery, portrait, vivid, cinema, etc. as well as a manual setting to do the same. Skin tones can also be set, as well as contrast, brightness, and several other nice functions. I have noticed no out of place pixels, and the color, clarity and resolution is very, very good over the entrie screen. The menu buttons take a little getting use to, but prove to be no problem You can also tilt the monitor either up or back from the stand that it is mounted on.. There is not much in documentation, but the inital setup is quite easy, with patch cables being supplied for a couple of different setups. Really, all other functions of the monitor are menu driven, and should you get confused, it has a "factory reset" button on it where it will revert back to the initial "out of the box" settings. I do not use the speakers in the ViewSonic as I have a set of Altec Lansing speakers with subwoofer, but the audio cord is also supplied should you elect to use the monitor's speakers. I purchased this product from Costco for $299, and thought it was quite an excellent buy. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking to upgrade from a smaller monitor.. 

$$;
Pros:. big!!! for someone just getting off a 15" laptop monitor. 
Cons:. hd title may be some what miss leading. 
Summary:. I have been using the Presario 15" monitor on my laptop and perhaps it's old eyes catching up with me but the larger screen helps big time.. After looking into a number of large screens on the market I found for the dollar one can not go wrong, when it comes to speadsheet and daily browsing, however, perhaps this is just a hardware issue, I have not managed to see that greatly expected high def. picture as advertised on the box. I managed to aquire the res 1680X1050 but perhaps I have to upgrade on my graphics in order to do so?. Can anyone out there help me?. Running with XP Home, AMD Turion64 Moble.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great buy for the price. 
Cons:. So far there aren't any. 
Summary:. I was using a 15" monitor so this one is so much better. I compared 10 different ones and felt that for the money, it was a very good buy. I highly recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large size, Image quality. 
Cons:. Tiny controls. 
Summary:. I am not an image enthusiast or gamer. This monitor gives me more than I could ask for in quality of image, size and especially price. Worth the $300 I paid at Costco for it(don't forget the great return policy too)and would recommend to all but the most discriminating of users...... 

$$;
Pros:. Perfect for my gamming BF2. 
Cons:. Nothing Bad. 
Summary:. I bought this LCD 6 months no problems no worries - Nvidia 7900 this thing rocks - I play a lot of games BF2, CS-WC=ALL this LCD is Excellent. I paid only $300 &#38; got a 3 year warranty "family discount". I am very satisfied.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear picture, big screen.. 
Cons:. None, in my opinion.. 
Summary:. I upgraded to this monitor when we completely refurbished our home office/computer room. My huge 19" CRT monitor was too long in the back to fit into the space we allowed so this gave me an excuse to go on the hunt for a flat screen, 'skinny' monitor. Costco was the first place we looked and there it was... We paid $329 for it and I'm totally satisfied. One of my favorite games is Blackhawk Down and it runs it perfectly. I upgraded my video card about two years ago and luckily it had a digital plug on it. So I'm able to use this monitor in digital mode - and it's great.. It just takes some getting used to all the 'real estate' you have in front of you. I can open two Firefox browser pages simultaneously with no problem. I just LOVE this monitor. I'm sure 'videophyles' can find something to carp about, but I'd consider myself an average computer user, and as such, I'm totally thrilled with my new Viewsonic monitor!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of real estate to work on multiple programs/pages. 
Cons:. Probably more than I need. 
Summary:. To be honest, it is too much area for what I do. I would probably have been better off using 2 19" or 2 20" monitors. Very nice/rich color. Easy on the eyes. I wear graduated glasses, and this is probably too high. (Kink in the neck.) Sound quality is terrible. I didn't buy it for the speakers though. It's handy in a low noise area. Small print (like this,) is much easier to see. I'm thinking seriously of using it for multimedia presentation at seminars combined with a projector. It has great potential for high def TV. I haven't tried that yet, but plan on in the near future.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent gaming, solid build, built in speakers. 
Cons:. no usb, very basic on inputs.. 
Summary:. I recently purchased this monitor to replace my Dell 1905fp which was a decent monitor but horrible for games.(very bad ghosting). I can definitely say this monitor is a serious upgrade in that respect. I wish it had usbs but for this price you can't have everything, bought it at office max for $329.00. I think it is an amazing monitor when you consider price. I almost returned it without even opening the box after reading the reviews but decided to check it out anyway before returning it. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was not as bad as the review lead me to believe. After some tweaking to the settings I am very pleased with the apperance and performance. I have only played one game so far, Oblivion but it looks amazing. Oblivion looked pretty bad in most of the underground scenes with my old monitor due to the slow 25ms response time, brick walls no longer ghost and look very sharp. Menus are more in depth than my Dells which gives you a little more control. I haven't been able to use utilities included due to the fact I am running Vista 64bit and utilities do not work at this time. They do however already have 64bit Vista drivers on their website which is nice. Vista looks great with this monitor. It would be nice to have the ability to adjust up and down but it's not as big of an issue because of the size. If your a gamer looking for a good budget widescreen this is a hard monitor to pass up.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture, speed and no dead pixels.. 
Cons:. Stand, buttons, minor back light bleed.. 
Summary:. I have been searching and researching an LCD monitor for several months. The picture on this monitor is one of the best I have seen, in store displays. The contrast is even across the whole screen and it shows details very evenly, The brightness is capable of more than you would need. There were no dead or stuck pixels. The stand is very sturdy and locks tight onto the monitor case. The bezel is well made and assembled. The "OptiClolor Mode" Standard, Text,Cinema,game,portrait,scenery and vivid settings are all very different and usefull. The speakers are not what I would call HIFI nor very loud. The panel control buttons are very thin and resesed and hard to find in the dark. The stand raises the screen very high. The bottom of the screen is 6 1/4" high and the top of the screen is 17 3/4" high. My computer stand has a pull out tray for the keyboard, a desk top(surface) and then a shelf 4 3/8" above, that holds the monitor, unfortunatly this makes me look up, tilting my head back to see the top of the screen,22+"high. Therefore I either have to cut off the monitor shelf and set the unit on the desk surface or look at the other monitor I was considering, a Samsung Vx2235wm, which has an adjustable stand but acording to professional reviews some backlight bleed isssues.. This Viewsonic monitor has a better picture than any of thier other monitors I have seen and no dark or overly bright spots on the screen. The game "Vietcong" looks great and plays the same as my old 16" CTX crt.. The buttons on this monitor can be activated with an unused pencil erasor and unless the height of the screen is an issue I would say this monitor rates a 8 out of ten.. Other models I have considered BenQ, Acer and Samsung, all with the same specs and in the same price range.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture, Design &#38; Price. 
Cons:. Control buttons and a hot pixel. 
Summary:. Overall a smart buy &#38; good value. Picked mine up at Costco for $299. A wide screen is nice for game-play and has default color settings for games, movies, etc.. Computer monitors are competitive so I beleive they all perform well. Since you are reading this to see the minor differences, below is me just being picky:. 1. The control buttons work fine, but they are small recessed slivers that are difficult to press.. 2. My only real compliant is a pesky "hot pixel" that shines red. The company's quality control should have caught it.. 3. As the previous comment mentions, I too have a slight white shadow bleeding from the blacklight around the screen edges. However, I only notice this on a black screen. It's fine once an image is displyed.. Again, I like this monitor and would have no problems purchasing another one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture. Nice slim 'n sexy look. In fact I like the glossy finish. OK for games and desktop applications. 
Cons:. Backlight seeable at the bottomof the screen in dark areas of movies and games. Some problems with the monitor that refuses some times to come back on after sleep. Sometimes have to hover the mouse to see rest of screen. Resolution issues. 
Summary:. I really like the product, had it for 224$ at WallMart. Good sexy looking monitor. Well suited for office production work. Having a large screen may sometimes pospone the purchase of a second monitor to get more working space. Good for gaming, though some other monitors are more suited for that task.. On the con side it has some weird issues, like loosing its resolution, refusing to come back up or to even turn on after sleep or even at the bootup.. Mine has no flickering issues like most of us that have purchased that monitor. Image is crystal clear.. Had it for 2 years now, had no issues until a week ago, when the monitor started to act strangelly, like not beeing able to comme back online after sleep or hibernate. Today it beganm to refuse even to turn on at boot.. I finally may have found a trick to "awake" it. I kept the power button pressed until it stayed blue, then all of a sudden the monitor awaked and now it seems to work flawlessly. May have been a corrupted control in the firmware. Sometimes you may be able to "reset" it. It worked for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price only.. 
Cons:. Missed the fine print on gaming and 3D CAD work.. 
Summary:. It took $73 and a week to ship it to their facility and it will be another three weeks before I will be told the resolution. Cheap prices = cheap components = downtime. Viewsonic isn't the only manufacture to skimp on specifications on product packaging. Which greatly hinders a qualified purchasing decision.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great size, love the black color. 
Cons:. Menu buttons too small, back cable clamp keeps popping out. 
Summary:. I purchased this monitor a week ago from Costco for $284 (July it will be at $259!) and I was sure the monitor would work great since Viewsonic is a well known brand. I have been using Viewsonic 17" flat monitor for many years now and decided to upgrade. I just can't seem to get rid of the blur and fuzziness on the top-to-mid left side of the screen. I thought my eyes were not seeing well but then I had my son look at it too and we could clearly see a distinction between that corner and any other location on the screen where everything is crystal, clear. I am really uncomfortable with this and have not decided what to do. Of course, contrary to what my brother told me about not getting anything else other than a Dell widescreen, I am thinking very hard to switch, unless someone can tell me I can fix this fuzziness.. I would probably return this and wait for a great Dell deal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice size, built-in speaker.. 
Cons:. Brightness is just barley OK, no HDMI connection, speaker is just loud enough to hear when you need to, not good with VGA connections. You can see where the backlight is in dark scenes.. 
Summary:. An under performer in the class of 22'' screens, this screen truthfully does not even deserve the rating CNET has given it.. 

$$;
Pros:. OK computer monitor. 
Cons:. Poor TV picture.. 
Summary:. Purchased unit with hope of being able to use it as an HDTV monitor as well as PC monitor in my RV. The picture from the DVI input is poor at best, lacking sharpness and having distortion. Seems OK as a PC monitor.. 

$$;
Pros:. big display. 
Cons:. mediocre quality, annoying humming noise.. 
Summary:. I must say I had higher expectation for this monitor, given the fact that Viewsonic has earned its reputation over the years (I own a couple of Viewsonic CRTs). This is my first Viewsonic LCD of five LCDs in total. Compared with others I have used (Sony, Dell, Samsung, Princeton), VX2235wm is ranked right around the middle.. The bottom line: if you can find something else better, go for it!. The contrast isn't the best, but for non-graphic intensive use, it's OK.. One thing that is annoying to me is the loud humming noise, possibly from the transformer inside the monitor. It's louder than my PC's noise!. 

$$;
Pros:. Low price, works out of box. 
Cons:. weak colors , uneven illumination, glossy frame. 
Summary:. Comparing a class of LCDs to each other is like comparing a rotten apple to a rotten orange, all are bad some worse. Very weak colors , slow response , very uneven backlighting, poor off axis viewing. Shop mostly by price instead of splitting hairs on a failed technology.. 

$$;
Pros:. I changed from a 17" CRT and the larger screen is a real plus.. 
Cons:. The best resolution I can use is 1280X800. One of the main selling points is the great 1680X1050 resolution.. 
Summary:. I've been trying since Christmas to get this monitor working properly, all to no avail. I bought a new computer that I know will work with a ViewSonic monitor. The technician in Office Depot connected my computer to a new ViewSonic monitor and 1680X1050 came right up. But, it will not come up on my monitor and I don't understand why. Iv'e downloaded a newer driver which didn't help either. I just don't think anyone should have that much trouble with a new product of any kind.. 

$$;
Pros:. A good monitor when it works. 
Cons:. Breaks down too often. 
Summary:. Not worth the trouble unless your local merchant will accept returns.. Purchased mine 14 months ago. Unit was bad out of the box - horizontal "waves". Replaced by the merchant (Costco). 14 months later the second unit began to exhibit the same "wavy" problem. Manufacturer won't replace unit past 12 months' warranty.. 

$$;
Pros:. Annoyingly painful to plug in cable at the back. 
Cons:. Have not try the full potential of the monitor. 
Summary:. Annoyingly painful to plug in cable at the back. 

$$;
Pros:. Brilliant, colorful display. 
Cons:. Stuck Pixel. 
Summary:. On the unit that I purchased, the radiant, colorful display is overshadowed by one stuck green pixel in the center of the monitor. I'm returning the monitor and will get a different brand. Apparently, from reading reviews of other monitors, Viewsonic has the dead/stuck pixel problem with many of their monitors. This is unacceptable. Quality standards should be higher by shipping monitors having only 0 pixel defects.. 

$$;
Pros:. Decentt image quality for price. 
Cons:. Dead pixels. 
Summary:. Returned first monitor that had a few dead pixels after a couple days of use. Second monitor is now littered with dead pixels and flickering pixels after one weeks worth of usage. Planning on returning second one to Circuit City and buying another brand.. 

$$;
Pros:. none - look for a diifferent model. 
Cons:. washed out color, annoying menu setup,. 
Summary:. I bought the VeiwSonic VX2235wm, believing in Costcos usual high standards in their products.. But this has been a real lemon. This model not only was dective, but had some other serious issuses. First, the written manual was very vague, pretty much a waiste of paper (except the tech support#). The tech was very helpful and determined the speaker was defective. He them told me to return it to Costco for a new one. But the onscreen menue was limited and anoying because it would turn off after a couple of seconds (making it very difficult to make adjustments). In other words, if you were not lighting fast with your decisions, you had to restart at the main menu and start all over from the beginning. My last major complaint about this model is how washed out the color/screen appears. Thank god Costco has a great return policy or i'd be pissed. Don't be fooled with size and price. This time I'm going to do more research before i buy my next widescreen.. 

$$;
Pros:. theres actual picture. 
Cons:. poor contrast, horrible customer service, conflicts with brand name graphics card and machines. 
Summary:. I got picture and I got sound.. THEN. it started.. The screen was displaying something other than the resolution BOTH the monitor and the graphics card says, so I have to use my mouse to pan back and forth, side to side to reach the end of the desktop. ie: the start menu button is hiding off the monitor somewhere.. I contacted both tech supports for monitor and graphics card, tech support for viewsonic was not helpful at all and tech support for my card, NVIDIA says they have problems with Viewsonic owners.. The price got me to this monitor as well as the rebate, the rebate arrived only to have me send in MORE proof of purchase 7 weeks after I purchased it. By then, proof is already gone and theyre $30 richer. Dont feed this monster any more of your hard earned cash and go somewhere else. I wish I did. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture. 
Cons:. Too much aspect distortion.. 
Summary:. The wide screen is good for spreadsheets, if this is your primary application. I just couldn't adapt to the distracting glossy black base frame.. Found I could not eliminate aspect distortion in many programs, particularly games like Gutter Ball and Links 2003. Bowling ball looks like a football and Sergio is 100 lbs overweight. I assume this is a software problem, but ViewSonic should acknowledge the shortfall. I use a G-force 5200 graphics card and have tried every tweak available, to no avail. After 1 week of use I developed double vision to the point I had to close one eye to get a good visual. Back went the VX2235wm to Costco. I now use a Sceptre 20" standard size. Works fine and my vision is back to normal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks nice on the outside.. 
Cons:. Problems with this one... Direct form ViewSonic tech support.. 
Summary:. I had high hopes for this monitor, especially at this price. I purchased this monitor from Costco for $350.00 U.S.. Got it home, hooked it up and no signal from the digital port. hooked it up via VGA and DVI, it worked but only in analog. I could not get a digital signal to the monitor via DVI.. So I called ViewSonic tech support and after trying a work around to no avail, the tech support rep told me to return the monitor and suggested I upgrade to a more expensive model. I asked her if there were known issues with this model, and she informed me that there were numerous issues with the VX2235wm. I don't know if it's just the batch that Costco has at a reduced price, but it was a real pain and let-down.. So first thing tomorrow I'm returning it, and the search continues. I guess you get what you pay for. Don't waste your time with this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. sound is all right. 
Cons:. screen is not bright, not as clear as it can be, doesn't adjust at any angle. 
Summary:. don't get one. 

$$;
Pros:. one monitor works. 
Cons:. Bought 3 monitors 10/08 from Quill, 1 stopped working the 10/08 Quill did replace, another one stopped working in 05/09, Called View Sonic Customer service 5 times, emailed and faxed info twice. They claim they could not find the info I sent.. 
Summary:. Monitors are not made to las. 

$$;
Pros:. WARRANY STINKS. 
Cons:. Customer services is HORRIBLE.. 
Summary:. If it is under warranty, YOU ARE LIABLE for shipping the product to be fixed. It cost me $80.00 to ship it but was told it would be covered. Then they turn around and said it is in your warranty that you are liable. I could have bought a new one for that price of shipping. Then try to get some satisfaction, FORGET IT, not even a return call after getting the run around for days. Just hope it doesn't break down under warranty or you are screwed!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Brand name. Size.. 
Cons:. After a week of use, it started turning off. You would have to press the on/off button to bring back the screen. After a minute or so, it turned off again.. 
Summary:. All my equipment is UPS protected. I sent it back to the manufacturer and they determined it was a fabrication fault. I received the monitor back, after three months and, guess what? It still have the same problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright Clean and Big workspace. 
Cons:. Customer support useless, warranty bogus. 
Summary:. While out of the Box the colors were acceptable for the average user, it does need color calibration. But beware. IF YOU USE A DEVICE THAT ATTACHES TO YOUR MONITOR SCREEN. YOU VOID YOUR WARRANTY. I had a brand new one out of the box. color calibrated it. the coating started coming off with an "approved brand" cleaner. The brands website carried the approval of viewsonic and was non ammonia or alcohol based. I contacted viewsonic, they said that they only recommend cleaning their screens with approved cleaners, yet they do not endorse any products to clean their screens, and thus cleaning constitutes customer abuse. Also attaching color calibration devices also constitutes customer abuse and voids the warranty. Then they attach this information to the serial number and if you call again they hang up on you saying that this issue was gone over with you and is settled 'click'..
