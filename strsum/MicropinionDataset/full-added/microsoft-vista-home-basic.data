well i just noticed that some of vista's annoying feature does some good things  .
usc prevents the installation of some rouge antispyware spysheriff  .
well did windows xp had the same criticism when it first came out  .
so does windows 2000  .
well yes it did  .
so stop complaining and just stick with xp or switch with vista  .
no need to brag about vista sucks , its the facts  .
well everyone haves their own opinion about vista  .
so i hope you find this review helpful  .
i recommend windows vista basic because it does not have that much crap on it  .
premium is ok for gamers .
its really well made  .
once you know how it works its perfect  .
hopefully the next microsoft operating system is as good as this  .
whilst i've had this basic i see no reason why i would want to switch back to xp or upgrade to home premium .
its awesome i love it  .
great for gaming as it shuts down the operating system while running the game as an os .
i is trying to do an upgrade , but it kept locking up on install  .
i booted xp up in safe mode , and vista made me do a clean install , but it backed up all my files to the new o/s  .
more features than i expected  .
sidebar gadgets are very handy  .
make sure you have 512 mb of ram  .
if you do , the system is very responsive  .
i have a gateway notebook with ati graphics 512 mb ram , 80gb hdd , and 2  .
0mhz amd processor the system has serious eye    candy  .
i love it so far  .
i think that windows vista is much easier to use than windows xp  .
ok , they may have copied some features from macinosh , but i would just like to point out one or two things before i go into the main review   the search bar on the task bar , windows has always had search  .
it was not as accessible though (it used to be that dog thing)  .
ok , they took macs idea and placed it on the desktop  .
tags , windows always had tags , they just used to be known as statistics or details  .
ok , they pinched macs idea by sticking them at the bottom of the screen  .
a chess game  .
big deal  .
it's a game  .
ok , main review i think that vista is much better than windows xp , and much easier to use  .
yes , it is slightly overpriced , but once you get used to it properly , you'd probably think it is worth the money the search    thing on the task bar makes life twenty times easier  .
much better than the bulky one in windows xp the taskbar and title bar (top of all windows)  .
they're nicely thinned out so they don't end up taking up 20% of the screen between them  .
(no , i don't have a resolution of 800�600 , it's actually 1280�1024) in fact , the only downside is that one or two applications occassionally crash  .
the good thing is though , you do not have to push the reset switch  .
you just use the end task feature in the task manager the dialog boxxes , they're there for a reason  .
ok , they might annoy you , but if you look properly , you should be able to see a shield  .
this warns you that it'll open a dialog box  .
i've never really needed to use these , and rarely pop up for me (except for when i need to pop into the system configuration files for something) 15gb of hard drive space    installation  .
come on , the os on it's own comes nowhere near that much  .
it would take probably 5gb tops (or a bit more , not sure , as i did an upgrade)  .
all that space is reserved for things such as updates , gadgets for sidebar , you know ok , maybe they did copy sidebar and it's bits 'n' bobs  .
they're rival companies , what do you expect  .
one more thing , the amount of people complaining that they cannot manually install it properly  .
it's an os , it is designed to be installed by a proper technician thanks for reading anyway .
i've completely moved to windows vista and don't plan on moving back  .
don't listen to the readers complaining because they do not know how to work with vista home basic  .
you can get aero glass , flip 3d and taskbar thumbnails in vista home basic check my thread i've posted on how to do it    .

enjoy  .
once i had opened the package that had contained my windows home basic laptop , i is very very happy about how well microsoft had made their new os  .
the first thing i noticed is how fast it was  .
it only took about 5 minutes to get the computer set up  .
it seemed weird that it is so fast , considering that my computer only has a single core processor and 512 mb of ram  .
the os also has great security options , such as the user account control , which helps prevent spyware  .
vista also has a slick futuristic look which really beats out the look of any other os  .
but basic only comes with a few media options and no windows aero (which is sweeeeet)  .
but if you are looking for a fast , convenient , and cool computer vista home basic is for you  .
updated  .
on sep 20 , 2008  .
i is in need of a new pc for basic home computing needs , no gaming , and bought this os already preinstalled the day vista went on sale  .
i find it to be a definite improvement over xp , especially in terms of security  .
the overall look and feel of the os is excellent , and it is very stable  .
so far all the software on used on xp works fine with vista  .
i also find the new windows mail to be a big improvement over outlook  .
it gives me no reason to use thunderbird i would ask people that have not used this software not to write opinions on it  .
there are too many people giving vista an unfair review based on no experience with the product .
i got the free basic home edition upgrade when i purchased a second computer  .
i ended up making one computer out of two , taking the best components from each and combining them into the one i kept  .
i recently installed the vista upgrade (had xp media edition) and i like it much better than xp  .
everything just appears to be cleaner and better organized  .
plus , it doesn't have near as many quirks as i always felt xp had finally , i don't know what everyone keeps complaining about because i have had zero problems with vista  .
the only item i had to work around is my webcam but it is a simple enough fix once i checked the manufacturer's website  .
i didn't even have to install a different driver all that said , i do not believe there's enough improvements or features on the basic edition to warrant paying 100 bucks plus  .
if you're happy with xp and cannot get a free vista upgrade like i did , stick with your old os .
vista is mainly used for user friendly but it take time to load , in the laptop we use vista the battery power is less compare to xp , network is easy to acess the windows mail and take the backup and to restore  .
if your considering upgrading to windows vista , you should backup your programs and files and you should consider moving your mail to a temporary on line account i lost my mail when i upgraded , even when using the backup as defined  .
it required me to jump through several hoops to get only part of it back  .
the jumping involved creating an account on someone elses xp machine and doing some voodoo from there to see mail from the backup disk (very time consuming)  .
i have been along for the ride with microsoft since day one and i must say that vista is a vast improvement over the other versions  .
the gadgets are a much needed improvement to the system  .
business folks will find this an invaluable tool especially if its intergrated to allow collaberation between workers still i find the system falls short of my expectations  .
i expected a software upgrade that would open me into my day of activity and let me move around within the tasks that i need to do  .
i just dont see this with vista  .
you still find your self opening this program to see what you have to do for the day and then another program to perform part of the work and yet another program to perform another part of the work why cant you start up windows in a program that tells you what is on your agenda for the day  .
and from there perform your tasks  .
you will find the graphics great and the gadgets a plus but its still not a user friendly program  .
oh yea the menus you were used to in xp well forget them they moved them around again and the explorer is quite difficult to navigate its not intutive at all all in all is it worth the jump from xp  .
if you have a pc thats less than 1 year old i would say go for it  .
other wise get it with your next planned hardware upgrade .
i'm a traditionally    published author  .
my tools until recently   a compaq presario desktop and a toshiba laptop , both made in 1998  .
in july 2006 , the laptop started doing strange things when i typed , so i bought a dell inspiron b130 laptop with windows xp sp2  .
what an upgrade  .
when i realized how important a new desktop would be , especially if anything happened to my laptop , i bought a dell dimension e520 desktop with windows vista home basic  .
i travel a lot to libraries and research facilities and having a good desktop means i don't have to depend on my laptop for all of my computing needs no , i don't work for dell ; amazingly enough , both of the new dell purchases (laptop and desktop) cost less than the compaq presario bought in 1999 the dimension e520 came with a 15 inch flat screen monitor , and the cpu's case has a quick release feature that allows for easy access  .
the case also makes carrying it a snap  .
these features only added to the pleasure of discovering a new computer and a new os , windows vista    .
when you copy a file to the same directory in windows explorer , the file no longer goes to the end of that directory ; the copy you made is next to the file just copied from ; great feature when you click on the start button (that's the button with the windows logo in a round ball which replaces the word start ) , you won't find run  .
instead , you'll find a field marked start search  .
this feature is handy , and if you type run in that field , you'll have the old run feature (otherwise , you'll find run in the accessories directory)  .
the new feel of all programs is its directory , making it pretty easy to find the program you're looking for i don't play games or download much of anything from the internet ; i don't burn dvds  .
instead , i write biographies of people who lived a long time ago  .
when writing and researching , i need a calendar but have never found one that suits my needs  .
that is , until microsoft calendar came along  .
i've never used this program before , but its performance in windows vista is like magic   click on the month/year of the smaller section to the left of the main viewing area , and travel (with a whoosh  .
) to a list of months in that year ; click on the year , and whoosh  .
you have a decade of years to select from ; click on the decade , and whoosh  .
you have a century at your fingertips (the calendar goes back to 1630  .
) the volume control in windows xp becomes the volume mixer in windows vista and links various volume controls in one environment  .
this is a very useful feature ; in windows xp , for example , in order to adjust the volume correctly while listening to ripped music in windows media player , i've always had to first adjust the volume control and then adjust the volume level in windows media player  .
these two features are now linked in the volume mixer as soon as i turned the computer on for the first time , i uninstalled mcafee , aol , earthlink    all of the free trial software programs that never seem to go away and take up space in my computing environment perhaps i'm fortunate enough to have purchased a brand new system with vista already installed  .
i've installed all of my older programs (even lotus word pro for windows 95) , but haven't figured out how to install zone labs' free version of zonealarm ; vista wo not let me  .
on my laptop with windows xp , i surf the internet safely with three free programs   spybot , avast and zonealarm ; spybot and avast seem to work well , so far , in a vista environment i may not be a computer geek , but windows vista has left me politely blinded by the light  .
i'm impressed with it  .
if i had to compare windows 95 or windows 98 to windows vista , i'd have to say the difference is like comparing a traveling carnival's amusement park to disneyland  .
i would have given home basic a 8/10 if it was not so difficult to install  .
first it had given me several error messages  .
then when i did a clean install with the upgrade disk (because thats one of the options) it would not activate  .
microsoft did little to help me activate it  .
but i finally figured out the problem (i put the computer in safe mode and installed it  .
hey it worked  .
you have to update your audio driver when you are finished  .
but other than that , this os looks amazing  .
the interface is sleek yet easy to use  .
the new interface makes it easier to use and search items  .
the search bar on your start menu is also handy  .
the windows media player 11 works much better on vista than on xp  .
the new photo gallery is also a handy tool  .
the games look great and are actually some    what more fun to play , but generally look better  .
the security is also good in vista but can be a little annoying , but it is necessary and helpful  .
overall its better than xp , but i just wish the installation went smoother  .
i have been using vista home edition for the last 6 months or so , since i got a new dell vostro 1000 laptop with 1g of ram and a amd sempron single core processor  .
not very good specs to try to use vista on , i'm afraid  .
it ran much better when i upgraded the ram to 2g (the max i could put on this machine) , and uninstalled most of dell's bloatware , thereby freeing up almost all of the system resources to run vista  .
now , vista actually runs pretty well  .
the feature i like the most is the windows mobility center , which makes it very easy to sync with a windows mobile device , and also it is easy to share an internet connection with a 3g phone running windows mobile  .
also , the gui is a vast upgrade over xp   the icons are very pretty , and it doesn't take much in the form of computer skill to run most applications  .
the cons  .
well , there are many  .
my biggest complaint is that it doesn't come with a built    in office program , such as office 2007  .
microsoft charges you anywhere from $200    $1 , 000 for this , depending on what you need it for  .
of course , you can download and install openoffice , which is a very nice set of office programs , for free , but you cannot use it to sync to a windows mobile device , which renders the mobility center useless unless you have microsoft office or an equilant microsoft office program  .
also , for all of this talk of improved security , microsoft still does not include an anti    virus program as part of it's operating system ; hence , you still have to go out and buy norton or some other security suite to protect your data  .
shame on you microsoft  .
oh , and one other thing   microsoft includes the entire vista operating system on your computer (ultimate , business , home premium , and basic) , so vista is taking up many times more space on your hard drive than is necessary  .
why cannot they simply install what you need to run vista basic , and leave the rest off of your computer  .
c'mon , it came on the new compaq replacement pc i had to get at short notice because my shuttle xp pro burned out  .
forst thing the wife asks , where is outlook express , i need to get an email  .
well , guess what , no outlook express and in windows mail , you get this cold message when trying to configure it for hotmail , windows mail no longer supports hotmail , get yourself another email account    .
now that is blunt  .
guess ill have to go to thunderbird and download a few apps to get hotmail to work on that  .
shame , yeah you can get it online at windows live , but its just such a heavy interface to read a friggin email  .
maybe ill dual boot to my xp partition to read my oe account , yeah right  .
might just dual boot and keep xp this is like the windows me compared to win98 .
in the future i believe that vista will score a 10 on this chart as the need to have operating system  .
however , it is glitchy now  .
i think that there going to sll th bug fix for practly nothing and jack up the cost of vista to make peopl buy vista because the bugs are fixed  .
which is why i bought ista ahead of time so i know how to fix the problmes now instead of later  .
plus i save money .
despite all the hoopblah that vista copies os    x (although i don't see that , with that awful drab grey of os    x  .
) , vista home basic is a nice introduction to the vista system  .
its definitely a major improvement over xp  .
considering all the glaring security holes that keep cropping up in xp , it seems many have forgotten the blaster debacle  .
vista is well organized and the setup is smooth problem free  .
its very easy on the eyes that even my mother and grandmother , who aren't computer centric , were instantly fasinated and attentive to the new vista  .
for everyone crying over the uac , stop your whining  .
its a very minor annoyance that you can easily turn off  .
i keep it on so i can get used to it  .
an extra click or two does not really bother me  .
vista has the new windows media player 11 , which is neck and neck with itunes  .
my only complaint with wmp 11 is its sound equalizer  .
they could definitely look at what itunes does there and copy it  .
vista includes the new internet explorer 7  .
this is a must for browsing these days  .
after dealing with years of security holes and problems with the ie 6 series , it's time to kill ie 6 for good and move on to 7  .
i love the tabbed browsing that firefox users have had for awhile  .
i also like rss feeds  .
the windows calender is definite , its about damn time , microsoft  .
all the regular accessories are there and 3rd party software is making it  .
i had no problems adding itunes , adobe acrobat reader 8 , flash player , and antivirus  .
overall , vista home is nice , but honestly i wish they'd just kill this version and start everyone with home premium .
well , it's about what i expected from microsoft  .
i've said it before , and i'll say it again   vista is windows me all over again  .
wait a while for the real ground breaker  .
me is an operating system that was , in many respects , worse than the previous windows 98se  .
it is plagued with bugs , and my father hated it  .
i waited for xp to do an upgrade , and i is glad i did i also got and oem version of xp for $100 when i did  .
i'll be waiting around for a similar deal in the future  .
prices are , for now , absolutely outrageous given the few benefits of having vista over xp i'm a little miffed because , when i bought my laptop , i missed the free vista upgrade deal from hp by three days  .
oh well so cnet , how about drm  .
does vista do any funky things like report songs/movies you're watching  .
or block more content from playing  .
it would be well worth your time and money to go ahead and get home premium instead installation   easy to clean install  .
upgrade can be hectic especially from xp to vista uninstallation   cannot downgrade  .
easy to upgrade interface   clean and modern compared to xp  .
similar to premium but no aero easibility   easy , but can be frustrating at first if you are coming from xp features   very bare boned support   microsoft support is a nightmare my computer specs    .
windows vista ultimate sp1 64bit  .
gateway lx6810  .
intel� core  .
2 quad  .
33ghz  .
640gb hard drive  .
8gb ram  .
64 bit vista seems better if u have the hardware  .
i have quad core , so i do not have that problem  .
but computer parts so cheap now    i built nice system , whole thing �375 (including 19 lcd)most parts about �50  .
the vista is all about the visual appeals the best new thing is the gadgets its just like a shortcut to virtually anything i am working on a 1 gb/ 256 mb ati mobility card/7200 rpm hdd laptop and the vista works well even with a large number of applications  .
the problem comes when you start a game since there are many things on desktop which is updating itself regularly , so the cpu usage fluctuates , which make ur system slow following things can improve the speed of ur machine 1  .
use original xp theme in vista the speed will increase drastically 2  .
use minimum visual setting in folder options remove all smooth edges , shadows etc the machine will work fast 3  .
dont use too many gadgets at a time 4  .
while playing game , close the side bar  .
check ur startup (run msconfig) , remove unwanted programs like itune update , java update , adobe reader startup , ms office start file some osa  .
exe , real player , quicktime etc 6  .
use ur updated drivers (for vista) , do not rely on vista drivers or old xp drivers  .
it may work fine , but have some compatibility issues 7  .
remove screensaver , desktop themes etc , even the wallpaper 8  .
try to keep at least 10    20% of ur drive space empty all the time (for all drives)  .
if u have less space in any drive , it will significantly impact the speed 9  .
use less number of usb plug n play device 10  .
increase ur page file size 11  .
do not use windows firewall , use some original software 12  .
use temperature control/fan speed control software these small steps will definitely improve ur system performance while using vista or any os .
i just bought a new inspiron 531 from dell , and vista came installed on it already  .
vista runs really slow , but it does have awesome graphics  .
the way the start menu is set up , it takes a little getting used to , compaired to windows xp it takes forever to install a lot of programs , and half of them don't even work so i have to un    install them anyway  .
otherwise , the programs crash the os i'm to the point where i may just send my dell back i thought vista is going to be great , especially on a new computer , but i'm regretting the purchase overall , i would not suggest an upgrade to vista , just yet  .
windows xp is definatly a better choice , until vista gets all the kinks out .
i thought it is the the right time to replace my old gateway piii  .
well dell had quite a deal at the time so i purchased the e521 with vista basic installed  .
i am not big into games so i figured this would do fine  .
the problem being that this operating system is really slow with the 512mb of memory it came with  .
windows explorer will just stop working , the wait time for programs to load increases and forget internet browsing  .
i ordered an extra 1gb of memory and will probably install the full capacity at some time  .
i'll update my post when i get it  .
all said i would wait a while for this if you are having no problems with xp .
it appears that non ms applications not written for vista have trouble accessing the registry , no matter how hard i try  .
bmp files insist on opening in the windows viewer  .
in the old days irfan view just grabbed the file association once and that is it  .
now you have to right click on an instance of every file type and set the association manually  .
except for  .
bmps even that does not work the user interface looks like gnome (linux) for some reason even down to stealing the default icon font and the multiple desktop concept  .
perhaps it's a frustrated programmer's little joke and hp will have to do something about providing drivers , i have a photosmart 150 digital camera and seems that hp is not going to create any vista drivers  .
and the driver for my deskjet 3820 printer is but a workaround solution i only paid 100 aus  .
dollars for an oem version with a new pc , it's not worth the money to upgrade from xp for now .
i have been using the beta version of vista since august of 2006  .
i currently own three pc's and an imac  .
the best way to sum up vista is this   go to a store that sells apple computers (like an apple store  .
) and play with os x  .
that's basically what vista is       a knock    off of mac osx  .
yes , vista is easy on the eyes , but otherwise , microsoft simply stole elements from osx and changed the names       like widgets to gadgets  .
they took the apple spotlight and made a search function at the bottom left hand corner , in the start menu and let's face it       this is microsoft , there will be plenty of bugs to work out and lots of vulnerability and security problems the first few months save your money and switch to a mac       that's what i did and there is not a day goes by that i do not regret it  .
became an early adopter because of an equipment failure and my xp source disks going missing  .
really cannot find much to recommend vista right now  .
many reliable xp features seem changed just for the sake of changing them a resource hog in the microsoft tradition , half of my old software apps wo not work at all and the rest were behaving strangely until i added a second gig of ram to my notebook  .
software vendors do not appear to be in any hurry to update or make their products vista compatible  .
the same for mobile phone , peripherals manufacturers etc  .
if you are upgrading an old machine you will have to download and manually install new drivers for nearly everything   video and sound cards , cameras , even mice  .
plug and play could not recognize or find them on or off off line  .
new search feature is needlessly complex with a steep learning curve in my opinion  .
it will probably be ok eventually but all in all i would recommend waiting well into 2008  .
your not missing anything .
if you think that you are just going to migrate from xp to vista , you had better set aside a few days just to find what microsoft renamed and moved in this new version  .
it would seem that if something works , you dont change it , you just improve on it  .
to put it in perspective , just imagine that you came home from work tomorrow , but your kids and wife were all renamed and every time you wanted to do something the lights go dim and you have to push a button for permission  .
all i have to say is that you had better buy a wig , because you will pull all of your hair out .
the bad    .
this version of windows vista is a big disappointment to me when i bought my new laptop  .
i is shocked to see that almost all of the cool new features that vista is famous for to not be there  .
i am very disappointed in the fact that this is just like windows xp , only a little more flashy  .
i have crashed vista numerous times just running simple applications such as yahoo site builder , and microsoft office  .
vista always is looking for a way to correct the problem which in turn leads to having to wait for a long time  .
i also wish that this version would have windows media center on it so that i could connect to a tv and use it  .
i think that would make my rating go up a couple of notches the good    .
i really love the new search features as i run power points for my church and i have to find different ones fast  .
it not only searches the name of the file , but also the contents for what you are looking for  .
i also really like the new way to connect to a wireless network  .
it is much simpler to type in a network key as you are able to see the key as you type  .
also you only have to type it in once which makes it a hole lot easier when you get into the 128bit encryption .
after reading several user opinions , i'm inclined to remain on windows xp sp2  .
at least i know it works with my software  .
i'd have to buy all new software if i went with xp  .
and the price  .
sheesh  .
can you say linux  .
jeff359w  .
i have used windows vista for about a day , but found i could not get all the drivers for my hardware  .
for example netgear sc101  .
hopefully will try again towards end of year when more drivers will be available  .
i bought a new computer and figured i would get one with the new vista os , i think i would have perferred windows xp now i need a new printer as the drivers for my lexmark are not compatible my roxio software is not compatible and who knows what else i'll find as i transfer stuff from my old computer  .
i is stunned to see a rating of 7  .
0 by robert vamosi after reading the actual review i is amazed that a rating this high resulted from such a lukewarm summation of the pros of this new windows version if apple ever gets their heads out of the sand and market an apple system at competitive prices (the apple clones notwithstanding several years back) then ms had better get down on their knees and pray or , they had better actually write software for pcs as innovative , system resource and user    friendly as apple has been since day one some of you may remember the hype of windows 95  .
i then lived in kirkland , wa about a mile from the shopping center parking lot where ms kicked off that windows version with major hoopla (start me up )  .
i didn't buy windows 95 then either (we had 4 almost new pcs in my home then)  .
i would not have upgraded to windows 95 for free and did not oh and this inbred insistence that ms has of giving preferential treatment to ms applications etc  .
with each and every windows incarnation needs to end now  .
i have vista ultimate so basic is probably even less worth it  .
i had medium hopes for vista but even with low expectations , after using it for about 2 weeks now i am still disappointed  .
my machine is a p4 3  .
2ghz , 1gb ram and radeon x800 128  .
one of the most basic things , the start menu is just terrible  .
when you click on programs in xp , it pops up in an instant  .
in vista there is a very noticeable and annoying delay  .
when playing counterstrike the os blue screens (yes , blue screens) on me and of course restarts  .
sure , this is probably due to the beta ati drivers but come on , why a complete os crash  .
same thing when testing the webcam from my pinnacle video capture card (to be fair , also non    vista drivers)  .
vista has a self    fixing feature which tries to determine when a program has stopped responding and then tries to find a solution for this problem and , of course , never finds a solution for it and just kills the program  .
most annoying is that it pops up an alert telling you it is trying to find a solution and my windows sidebar constantly has this problem and thus i constantly get popups  .
i'm not even gonna talk about ie  .
just use firefox  .
i'm gonna stay on vista since slowly better drivers are coming out and i'm still hopeful it will improve  .
i understand that a lot of the problems are due to vendor drivers and ms is not fully responsible for that but the native vista features also just do not perform acceptably if you are buying a new computer , of course , get vista  .
all the hardware will likely work fine  .
if you are just looking to upgrade xp , hold off until you see a lot of good user reviews  .
you are not missing anything from vista .
i am very disappointed with the product  .
it's not what it is cracked up to be  .
i am more disapointed to discover that it will cost $59  .
00 to speak with a technician to correct the error problem in task launcher when the dell 1525 computer is a month old and came with vista premium pre    installed  .
tech support should be free for at least ninety days .
este sistema operativo es demasiado lento y requiere una computadora muy moderna , inclusive con lo mas moderno es demasiado lento e inestable , personalmente prefiero 100 veces mas a windows xp profesional , es mas estable , rapido y no requiere tanto recurso de hardware , es una lastima que windows vista sea un fracaso , ojala que puedan hacer algo para que realmente valga la pena , actualmente es muco mejor el xp que esto .
my main beefs are with the picture display program  .
xp picture viewers all have the horizontal vertical scrolling features built in , even with zoom in use  .
not so at all with the new media viewer  .
zooming is all you can do with no freedom to scroll anywhere , plus picture quality decreases with the zooming , even with high quality images  .
this is garbage  .
additionally , my hp 5510 all    in    one scan functions will not work in the easy to use xp methods  .
hp nor microsoft will bother , so far to fix this problem  .
you can use other programs to use your scan function within these other programs , but just try to install the software disc from hp  .
no way , vista refuses to allow it  .
just another greed envisioned upgrade to get other companies to catch up to make their stuff compatible  .
screw vista , i say  .
i still would rather use my previous xp pc with all the faults and hesitation  .
at least i'm used to it  .
this vista is an unnecessary trip for microsoft to have taken  .
i really hope they do not aquire yahoo  .
i'll stop using my yahoo email accounts immediately , out of spite  .
i feel like i wasted my entire purchase price for the vista pc  .
i eventually will attampt to add xp professional to the new pc , but i feel that should not have had to be necessary microsoft has lost a lot more of my respect , although i'll never switch to a mac over it  .
apple is even more pompous and money hungry maybe in a few more months when i've stopped  .
being enraged by this waste of my time , i'll add xp to it and probably not even use the vista part ever again , what for , it is not user friendly  .
oh yeah , i'm writing this from my xp pc , which i greatly prefer , with all it's faults .
windows vista , when compared with the convenience and efficiency of windows xp , is just plain junk  .
if you already have windows xp , i cannot beg you enough not to upgrade until it's absolutely necessary  .
if you're getting a new computer , i'm sure vista is actually pretty good  .
it's not unreasonable to expect that upgrading your system software will be a pain in the butt , but vista takes this to the extreme  .
the included new windows media player is so bad that i wanted to cry wishing that i still had the old one  .
yes , it really is that bad  .
as for the free web blocker , don't think that it's worth saving the extra money  .
if you're a parent , go out and buy some good internet protection software online  .
you wouldn't believe how many ridiculous web pages the software unnecessarily filters  .
navigation is a little bit more intuitive than in windows xp , but that doesn't nearly justify all the crap that vista will give you  .
i won't even get started talking about how it ruined my experience with yahoo music (which is riddled with technical problems already) for fear that i might break something in rage  .
in short , do us all a favor and boycott this pathetic load of crap that microsoft calls an operating system until they come out with something actually intuitive  .
better yet , go increase apple's share of the market  .
just whatever you do , do not upgrade to this .
i cannot simoultaneously run 3 apps on vista without a crash  .
today it froze as i tried to install an ms web cam while i logged on to msn messenger  .
if given a choice , stay with xp sp2 .
if you can get away without having to upgrade to this , do  .
xp ver 2 is one hell of a lot better .
in my opinion stick to windows xp , i just lost 10gb of data on my windows vista i found too many folders in my documents so i started to delete a few then it came to a folder that had the same folders as my documents i moved a few folders out and deleted that one folder and after deleting that one folder the other folders i moved out of it were gone  .
windows vista is a peice of trash it's all looks if they updated the look with xp and ran it like xp it would have been so much better i advise wait until there are more updates before moving on even then check out reviews before getting it i have a feeling it's going to be the same trash that it has now i would give it a zero but i admit it looks nice i'm downgrading back to windows xp  .
after all said and done i wish i never installed it  .
my mainframe fried last wed and i had to purchase a new one immediately  .
i is told by a bb computer geek that really unless i did more than just typical usage of computer that i would b just fine w/o the vista not to mention that if i waited 4 it this week it would cost me about $100 more for a computer besides if i send in my receipt i would get a free upgrade  .
after reading all the opinions i think i will be fine and just hold on to this receipt  .
^_^  .
i have long been a windows fan but even an ardent fan knows when he is being scammed  .
there is no reason the leave xp ever , as far as  i  see  .
no more than there is a reason to leave office 2000    which still has far more features than i would ever use  .
if you are a gamer like me your going to have to upgrade your graphics card  .
when direct x 10 comes out  .
its suppost to come out in march  .
the cards for direct x 10 are expensive  .
vista will still work but what the point  .
even though there is no more backwards compatability with games (old games till work)  .
but i see there point why rewrite code for older computers  .
the graphics with direct x 10 are a lot better  .
it is a huge step foward btw vista comes with drm (direct rights managment) so you have to download rights to watch a dvd  .
if i where you only upgrade if you got the money (vista is really expensive  .
not even worth it  .
you miles well stick with windows xp home , because this version of vista is stripped of just about everything that attracts vista in the first place vista premium edition is the best all the way around for the avg pc user .
i like the speed , but that is probably due to buying a new computer with more memory  .
otherwise , i would take back xp in a flash  .
i do not much like enough of vista to be satisfied , but guess i am stuck  .
i woudl not recommend anyone trade xp for vista  .
mostly , it makes me nuts .
the new operating system seems not very exiting in fact is a deception due to the power and security it shows but has a humongus lack of compatibility with software of all kinds  .
it seems like it is designed just to work with a new software generation and that  .
s it sooo , if you are thinking about getting it just to try it let me tell you what software is not compatible and you  .
ll have problems with   motorola , serif , java , adobe applications (almost none are compatible and don  .
t work at all) , nokia ,  .
microsoft outlook 2000 , microsoft frontpage  .
, and g  .
d knows what else , when i called microsoft they were confused what is happening and why but after the fifth call they told me that 64    bits versions were not designed to operate with any older software so i had to adjust my self to the new technology , which in a way it  .
s true but unless you are prepare to migrate from the current software we all use and jump on to the new software elite think twice about getting vista 64    bits also this shall blow your mind  .
hope you  .
re sitting  .
they took away features and accessories that were traditionally included within windows such is the case of the fax manager  .
yes now you have to pay separetly for it , because is not included any more , so if you need it forget it or pay the consecuences  .
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ , same thing if you want to watch a presentation done with adobe flash player or shockwave (forget about you tube ha  .
) i will not let them extort me so i  .
m learning lynux so far i  .
m surprise how fast it runs in my pentium 4 with 2gb truly almost as fast as vista 64    bits , apps may vary but i  .
ll survive and save my money .
i do not like it is crap .
i assumed with vista my computer would boot faster , run faster and make my computing experience more pleasurable       just the opposite  .
this is one of the worst os i ever saw and i had them all 3  .
1 98 and 98se and of course me and the xp and now this so call great system i am thinking of going out and buying a os xp system to put on this computer , vista home basic is one of the slowest systems that i have saw in a long time and it is always upgrading something , but i had no choose i is told it is on all new computer's my old computer is a lot faster then this vista and that one is os me so that is not saying a lot for the os vista and everyone that i have talken to who have this os hate it also  .
i have had so many problemss , crashing , freezing , problems with wireless and internet connection  .
when i call lenovo , suggest downgrade to windows xp  .
latest is i tried to do backup and froze  .
tried several times  .
computer is new and i would love suggestions .
i just bought a new h    p because dell had irritated me so much with their lousy customer support service , which i think is now based in outer mongolia  .
it came with windows vista home premium preloaded , and i soon found that i could not do what i really wanted to do   strip the boot drive and reinstall windows pro  .
when i finally managed to get it running , i found out that plugging in my printer , scanner , or wireless keyboard (all less than two years old) would lock up the system  .
i'll spend tomorrow reboxing the system and sending it back to h    p  .
i've been into pcs for more than 25 years , and i've never seen a worse debacle than vista  .
if you're thinking about getting it , save your money until microsoft comes to its senses .
worst os microsoft has ever come up with  .
windows vista basic really gives you nothing , it is a total waste of money since it doesnt provide anything cool and new that windows vista home have  .
if you have windows xp home right now i suggest you never upgrade to vista basic it is just a big waste of money .
i just bought a new dell  .
it had vista home on it  .
i just hate it  .
my printer , scanner ect dosent work with it and i cannot get the drivers to fix the problem  .
xp is so much easier and compatable with anything  .
i wanted to put xp on new computer and dell informed me if i did i would void the warrenty  .
vista is a huge flop  .
i just bought a brand new toshiba a    135 and , personaly i think the guys at windows gt bored and just up all the serurity features and sold it to companys for to much money  .
i wish there is a way to down grade to xp , but vista wont let you  .
vista just runs way to slow , fotunitly there is a way to turn off the warnings we all have heard about on the mac commercials .
i have windows vista minimized in my dock right now  .
i mainly bought it so i could use an old homeschooling program i have that is not mac compatible , and so i can check my websites in internet exploder  .
worst $200 i've ever spent  .
windows xp is horrible , this is not much different  .
microsoft pretty much just updated the graphics and security a little , and threw in some old os x features  .
hell , they even did a bad job with that  .
the copied features are much better on os x than vista    and if you want all of vista you have to pay an extra $100 for ultimate  .
people , wake up  .
i got a g5 imac for christmas a few months ago , and it's by far better than any pc i have  .
tiger is almost two years old and it still blows vista away  .
if you're planning on getting a new computer , go luxury  .
go mac .
i just bought a new dell computer , but am sending it back because there are no vista drivers for any of my three printers       a canon and two hp's  .
(two of the three printers are still being sold in stores  .
) how can microsoft field an os that does not support printers from two of the largest printer manufacturers  .
how can the printer manufacturers not have drivers available by the time microsoft fields a new version of windows  .
how can pc manufacturers like dell agree to put an os on the systems they sell without decent printer support  .
i wonder how many computers are being sent back because the buyers cannot print anything  .
what use is an operating system if you cannot print  .
just avoid this os  .
go xp or windows 7 if your system can handle it  .
i do not have to say anything about xp , as for 7 , it's the stability of xp and sleekness of vista with a few more pros and a lot less cons  .
but thats for a different review .
the worst os ever  .
nothing works on this ms vista os (home , premium and any kind of versions)  .
this slower than a sleeping sloth  .
everything you do , that stupid blue circle which i feel like breaking on bill gates gosh darn head  .
nothing can be installed on this piece of shiiii the entire dev team for this piece of garbage should be fired i hope everyone in microshort (bus) company reads this .
i used vista for about a month it waz a nightmare it takes ages to start up it then runs slow kept getting a blue crash screen when i tryed to use the wireless internet its a complete disgrace microsoft are really making there money by ripping people off with this joke of a ting  .
better off sticking with xp or change from windows like i did to ubuntu linux have no slow problems its alot more like windows than windows users tink  .
and also no viruses spyware or malaware to worry about with linux  .
firstly , i bought this brand new dell (inspiron 530s desktop which is not all that bad in itself) with vista basic in december of '08 (approx 3 months ago)  .
now i should mention the reason i went with basic , is firstly because i is in desperate need of a new computer because my current one is very close to blowing up  .
so i is on a strict budget at the time and needed a cheap decent computer that just worked i decided on vista basic purely for the reason that my friend had vista home premium , and she had lent me her computer for a week or so so i could share some files and get her all set up  .
now that os is absolutely atrocious , every time i tried to do anything it would double    check with me that what i is doing , is what i actually wanted to do  .
allow  .
deny  .
the pc vs  .
mac commercials do not lie  .
plus i hear with all the media center and such that there are many back door big brother issues involved so i decided that home basic would do , mainly for the above reasons there are less security features to hassle with  .
the gui is not so intense that it'll take up half of your ram  .
not any back door issues that i'm currently aware of first start    up starting up the computer up for the first time didn't seem too bad and i is actually somewhat surprised at how much i didn't mind it  .
it is a big jump up from home premium in a sense that it was not too fancy looking , nice and simple , decent customization options as far as the look of your gui goes as time goes on , i realize how different vista really is from xp as far as the layout of your general files and programs goes  .
they've changed up their my documents to just documents and rather than all of your documents being in there , it's strictly just a folder for your documents  .
(and your my received files from windows live messenger which i might add has also taken a large turn for the worse (as of march '09)) back on subject  .
in this stephen folder , which i find is basically now the old my documents folder on previous versions of windows  .
in there you have your contacts , desktop , documents , downloads , favorites , links , music , pictures , saved games , searches and videos (yes i had to look at the window for that now this little addition seems nice at first , but then once you notice that for some reason all of your downloaded files start ending up in random places , you realize that you have to do all of this organization yourself  .
this is a normal practice for myself when i did have xp , but because microsoft hadn't changed the overall layout of the os from 98 too much i got used to it  .
trust me though there are many other underlying differences within windows explorer itself  .
i really don't enjoy having to search for everything all the time next up is the not so lovely start menu it seems nice and relatively similar to that of the start menu in both versions of xp , until you try and access your programs folder  .
wow all it gives you is a tiny window to view all of your programs with  .
and once you find the folder you want next (for instance accessories) you actually have no option but to click on the folder which is not that big of a problem  .
but once you do it takes a second or two to even open that folder for you now i'm also a bit of a hobbyist when it comes to photo editing  .
so i use photoshop cs2 quite frequently , but i am by no means a pro  .
i just like fiddling around with photos , applying filters , cropping for facebook and such  .
and for some unknown reason no matter what i do it asks me every time i start up photoshop if i'd like to allow the adobe updater to run  .
yes i do allow please and remember next time  .
that feature really kills me on this os now another issue , is security  .
yes i know i wanted less security than other higher end versions of the os , but i didn't say i wanted no security at all  .
during 7 years of having windows xp , i have never had a virus or my computer slow down as a result of some spyware etc , mainly because i consider myself a smart surfer in a sense that i avoid ads , do not stray too far from the site you were currently on through links  .
and ever since my free trial period of mcafee has ended , i've had startup problems resulting in having to boot through safe mode and use system restore i'm running out of room to talk so i'll make a big blunt point here if you have a good machine running xp keep it as long as you can , take damn good care of it because it's a gem and must be protected  .
once you've exhausted that resource , simply  .
get a mac of any sort  .
i have used them quite frequently through friends and such and as soon as i can get the dough this piece of junk is either getting dumped or donated .
i've been using vista , it think it is going on two years now  .
i'm not sure what feature makes it so slow but i've gotten so feed up that i vowed to never again by a computer with a microsoft operating system  .
now i'm going further by writing reviews to warn others not to make the same mistake  .
avoid vista if you like a responsive system  .
just opening a program for example  .
click on the icon and bam it's open with my mac  .
with vista no response for a few seconds then i get the newly designed hour class for 30 secs of so then then it disappears  .
i'm left wondering okay is it opening did i really click on the icon oh wait the hour glass again then slowly as if it is not really sure it wants to open the program it opens  .
oh , you'll love this one  .
click open a document you get the same thing then the program opens to and then it tells you it cannot find the document so you have to click on it again and wait some more  .
what is microsoft doing when then put this out  .
vista is to mac what dial up is to dsl  .
do yourself a favor make the switch to mac the learning curve is minimal and you will never regret the switch .
while i have never owned this os personally , and never will  .
i had the displeasure of using it for work and some of my friends have it  .
wow what a setback for an operating system , its like they just slapped it together and sold it  .
i like win xp alot more , now i know win xp is not perfect by far either , but its alot easier to work with in my opinion  .
just like with win me , i will just sit back and wait till somthing alot better comes out then wasting my time and money on this garbage .
i'm telling you , folks , bet a little more money and buy home premium , because home basic is not the kind of operating system for web surfing , work , or anything fun .
i cannot comprehend how cnet could possibly give this os such a high review other than being in the pocket of microsoft  .
i cannot even downgrade back to xp without massive effort  .
dell no longer offers vista on their new computers because of the high number of client complaints .
had to get a new computer , it had vista and best buys would not install xp best buys also sucks .
i purchased a new computer from dell with vista  .
i basically had no choice  .
dell sold their soul to microsoft and offers very few computers with xp i remember when vista is was code    named longhorn and is rumored to be the next step in the os war  .
the biggest and best  .
none of that is true the os looks basically the same as xp , except more complicated due to icons and features being hidden all over the place  .
microsoft includes a nag screen , that asks you if you want to deny or allow  .
it does this all of the time  .
with anything that you do  .
you have to do a google search to find out how to remove this feature  .
then it no longer asks you anything  .
so say good buy to spyware protection  .
the os is so freakin' slow  .
it takes three times as long to load vista when compared to xp  .
crash screens are common  .
programs will free    up for no reason at all  .
when they do freeze , and you told the os to close them down , they keep nagging you trying to make sure that you want to close them down  .
if an application does freeze , you can not load the task manager fast enough to make any timely differences  .
if you can load the take manager , it won't always close the app down  .
so you will have to wait until vista notices that the software is not loading  .
so yet more times wasted  .
there is no driver support  .
software that would load on xp , will not run on vista  .
even though you could run older versions of software on xp and if you need help , you will never get any help from microsoft  .
have you ever tried contacting them  .
generic replies are all they send  .
phone calls are routed to person in another part of the world that doesn't even have computers  .
the have are also known for charging customers for help so all in all , vista is the biggest piece of crap ever made  .
even worse then the moto razr 2  .
so do not waste you money , but you will not have any choice in time  .
vista is being set up to replace xp  .
so thanks microsoft for making yet another worthless product  .
that is what you get for outsources everything you make now do you remember windows me or windows 2003  .
nope  .
so forget about vista , because it is doa  .
i had to buy a ram upgrade on a brand new machine just to get it to sort of work  .
i truly hate this os .
i've had a new computer with vista for approx  .
1 month  .
so far i've had 81 problems , 26 of those major this pos is slow as molasses in january it doesn't run 40% of my software i had to buy   a new webcam (not compatible (nc)) , a new printer (nc) , new joystick (nc)  .
after buying all new things , i had to spend more than 60 hours downloading the software from various vendors because the cd's wouldn't run on vista half the software 'included' with new computer would not run because it was not compatible with vista  .
in short vista suckseggs  .
i wish i had a choice of getting a nw computer with xp instead of this worthless pos  .
first of all it needs over 512k of ram just to run the vista , so the computer which is bought for very basic needs had to be upgraded right away  .
if you are used to previous versions of windows , forget about it , vista is not intuitive at all  .
so far this is the worst windows i've ever used .
vista is a crapy copy of osx  .
vista has lousy security  .
few drivers work  .
ie7 sucks  .
installation is slow and    .
windows sucks to begin with  .
just get a mac and save yourself the trouble .
stay with xp at all costs until they sort out all the bugs  .
because there are a lot in my opinion  .
pretty , flashy , gaudy , and pretentious for the shallow crowd  .
custom made for the friends of friends and roseanne  .
too ponderous , buggy , and extrinsic for power users  .
hey bill  .
how about an os for serious people  .

run from this piece of   as fast as you can  .
this is by far microsoft's most blatant attempt to separate you from your money and give you nothing in return .
what crap  .
honestly , after all that wait , this is the best they could do  .
i can just imagine apple's ceo (steeve jobs) laughing  .
we are releasing the new operationg system sometime in the middle of the financial year , and all windows could do is incorporate features apple had incorporated in our existing os  .
how shocking , thats why apply has taken 1  .
8 percent market share within two years utterly pathetic , do not even know why people buy it  .
must love service fees , warranties and norton anti    virus  .
i quote 'unstable'  .
enough said just pathetic  .
just a general comment about upgrading to anything major  .
bottom line   don't be hasty to do it  .
companies in general and drug and computer corporations in particular , are pretty much only in it for the money  .
they want to push the product/s out of the door and into people's hot little hands to get their cash instead of investing the time time to test products to make sure it works correctly and has no long    term ill effects my rule of thumb is to wait a while        .
say 6    8mos       on something as major as a new operating system so they can work any major bugs out before i'd invest in something like that please note   if you take the plunge and do get vista (or any other upgrade to a program) , be sure to scan your system with good spyware/adware and virus programs  .
knowing good 'ole microsoft , they'll put a lot of unneeded and harmful s t on your computer  .
when i upgraded to ie7 not long ago , some junk came up in scans i did on my system  .
thanks a freakin' bunch , microsoft  .
if there was not such a pathetic shortage of software for it , i'd go back to using a mac                                                                                                                          .
as far as drugs are concerned (off topic , i know) , i'd wait a year before trying anything new on the market  .
case/s in point   everyone raved about drugs like phen    phen (diet pill) , paxil (anti    depressant) and ortho    evra (birth control patch) until people started having horrible problems from heart attacks , liver failure and death before they took this s t off the market  .
why  .
drug co's did not want to wait a few years after the drugs were approved to see how it would affect people long term  .
they threw it on the market as soon as it is deemed marketable or safe to get people's money  .
and then they have the gall to price them so high that those who cannot afford health insurance cannot get them so they can stay well  .
disgusting  .
thanks for reading my rants  .
~jlf  .
i wo not get into the pros and cons of this new operating system in terms of the usual critique , because it's all been covered here  .
what i want all of you to be aware about are the technologies that microsoft has implemented in order to control what you can or can not view or listen too  .
if you are not familiar with drm , them please read about it  .
microsoft has also implemented aacs within vista , and this is also something you really need to inform yourselves about  .
i suggest you start on this website    .

grc  .
com/securitynow  .
htm#76  .
listen to episodes 73 , 74 and 75  .
you might be shocked at what you will hear  .
if you're not that tech    savvy you'll probably have to listen to these shows a couple of times .
Just read my comments; Just read my comments
Awesome Graphics; Runs slow! Some programs don't work.
Smooth Look; Slow in some Areas
Windows gagets, Search, Network Connections; No Windows Aero, No Media Center, No 3D Flip
I have none.; printers, scanners, camera's
Not worth talking about, imo.; Many, mostly unnecessary changes, incompatibilty with existing combo scanner/printer.
Looks better; Read the article
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!; Annoying nag screens, overly complicated, no new standout features
Modern and safer; Unsupported and overloaded
Good question; Not as good as XP 2
no not one...; Inumerable....
Easy to learn; slow without proper memory
Low system requirments (more for gaming); No windows aero (if you consider that bad)
Some minor improvements; Print Drivers are still not available from many companies.
Fast and Easy; There isnt any
It's prettier than Windows XP.; Looks can be deceiving.
Nothing Pro About it; Dunno where to start
It's New(er); Few reasons to upgrade, big brother control mechanisms
Haven't found any yet; Where to start ?
Appealing and Smart; Slow for games, huge applications
Easier to use; Just read below, you'll be able to pull out your own ;-)
absolutely none; You name it and it's slower and clunkier.
Cleaner, smoother, more aesthetically pleasing.; Not worth paying for in my eyes.
Clean interface &#38; nice sidebar; Most of my software won't work on it
Easy file integration from XP (even if doing a clean install); Somewhat sluggish while multitasking
None that I can find; Just about everything
not a lot ......................................................................................................................................; not as good as xp ............................................................................................
Graphics, Security Updates and Prosseing Power; Cannot use any kind of messenger (AIM, Yahoo!) or LimeWire
Some Mac OSX Tiger features; As CNET Said, no need to upgrade
Looks a little cleaner; just about everything
Pretty GUI and Desktop; Software Developers just are'nt supporting it yet
I miss my XP; there are no Pro
Gadgets, Graphics, Speed; Upgrade from you old PC is tricky to poor
Very Good New Graphics; NO BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY, 3 card support is, no sound as of yet, over priced.
It doesn't crash quite as often as Windows 98, but...; there's just not the non MS software out there right now
good system without windows defender; hard to get my system mechanic 7 pro to work but after 15 hrs got it done
It's very pretty!; It's XP with a different skin and "gadgets"
haven't used it; from what the general consencence seem to be...not worth it
DirectX 10; stripped of just about everything that attracts Vista in the first place.
It is more modern than xp for sure.; No Aero, No Media Center, No Codecs pre installed, no eye catching features
None it is terrible; everything it treats a person as a child
there are no pros; everything is a con
what pros?; it doesn't comply with numerous popular programs, doesn't have drivers for printers, locks up, causes intermitent internet, takes forever for a file transfer - minimal in former versions
Excellent look and love the security. Simple to use.; Stripped down version of Home Premium and Ultimate.
no cons. its wonderful; its cleaned up alot of my problems and is extremely stable and fast!
Automatic security (baby sitter) for those who don't have a brain.; Crashes like Humpty Dumpty and everything has been moved around.
Amazing interface, Secure, Sidebar and Gadgets, Windows media player 11, Windows Photo Gallery, new games and great search tools.; Very Difficult to install, not all drivers are supported, Poor and expensive customer service.
It's newer-ish and it's absolute eye candy.; Well, pretty much everything else not mentioned in the "Pros" section above.
I found absolutely no reason to switch period!; Warmed-over XP at a ridiculous retail
disk access/copy time is greatly improved,as well as internet control/speed; doesn't seem to run a lot better than xp otherwise
There is no pros for this unfortunately; Everything about this piece of crap OS is a CON ... nothing works on this pieace of garbage ....
Looks, Cute, Colors, Fading in and out, Search Bar,; Promps for everything! Can't delete a folder without losing other folders that may have short cuts in it
It's the Newest and Latest; Not compatible with a lot of older programs
Excellent Security, Very Fast (depending on your system), And has a futuristic look that is way cooler than any OS I've ever seen; Not too many media options, No Windows Aero
Navigating your hard drive is occasionally easier due to the new interface.; Renders many non-Microsoft applications virtually unusable and just plain screws everything up, included software is absolutely horrible.
None. Not a single thing in it is an improvement over Windows Pro, or even Media Center Edition.; Doesn't recognize legacy hardware or software; time-consuming installation; no control over how it handles installations; in short, the worst mistake Microsoft has ever made.
It comes with one or two nice default desktop backgrounds; Those wallpapers lose their appeal after a week or so. Annoying to do direct system backup from my old XP machine without a male to male USB. It's slow, Bad layout in windows explorer, I'll explain more below.
It's Vista! Why better than XP :) More organized, faster, safer and better than other Windows versions.; Still not supported by some things. No biggie 'cause I got everything I needed to work.
Not many. Eye candy if your hardware can handle it; Unstable Beta drivers for a lot of hardware, IE7 is just unusable, "feels" slower than XP. Tries to "fix" itself too much for its own good.
UAC: may be annoying, but it prevents spyware. If you attempt to install spyware but you find out its spyware, just press "cancel.". Windows Defender: better then no antispyware.. I mean did Windows XP had the same thing when it comes out?; Well, the Parent Controls really lags my Dell everytime i try to log out.
no pros at all its very slow and annoying wouldnt recommend any1 even bother using vista basic ..; slow,hardware conflicts,confusing to use,it is very annoying when the whole system freezes up over a simple operation!!
Relatively cheap (but costs much more than its worth) A real "pro" is that anybody running XP can save money by keeping it and not buying VISTA . XP is s much better product. XP to Vista is retrograde evolution!!; Everything!! All laptops wo 1gig of memory, poor performance, most programs won't run under vista.
It functions; security is much improved over XP; updates are making it much better than when it came out last year.; Still a memory pig on stilts, sluggish and cumbersome, needs lots of resources to run this beast of an operating system.
It is definately more secure than XP2.; Extremly difficult to transfer files from XP2. Many of my photo's are not supported. Seems like photo's on the CD did not have the right codes. I cannot open the windows task launcher. It has an error mssage, Instructions to set the D.E.P. are vague.
Can't think of a single thing; This OS was preloaded into my Acer laptop, and it was the slowest OS in the whole world. The laptop had only 512 MB of RAM installed. There is no Aero, no Flip 3D, none of the fun stuff. Even with the SP, it was still too slow.
"All Programs" is now a directory; Windows Defender provides basic Internet defense; copying a file to the same folder in Windows Explorer keeps the copied file next to the original.; I can't install ZoneLabs' most recent version of ZoneAlarm, while Lotus Word Pro for Windows 95 installed perfectly as have most of my older programs.
It feels fast during surfing , due to the new RAM capabilities 4GB MIN and up to 128 GB (that's a difference), and the system is very secure.. The fact that they came up with a Fast and Reliable System Wake-Up is absolutely magnificent.; HUMONGUS lack of compatibility with software of all kinds.. Over-Priced and Short-Handed they cut back on accessories that were included since Windows 95, what a JOKE!.. Lack of knowledge on their Non-American-Base customer service team.
The Log In menu is slightly nicer; Everything is slower that XP. My advice is to stay with XP. You could just be using a program, and it will stop responding. Many programs have not yet been released on Vista aswell.
You will have time to do other things while you wait for the system to start up, open a program, or the longest wait for sure shutting down. It convinced me to try a MAC and I love it.; SLOW. Trouble loading software. Block start up programs, it annoyingly reminds you forever. Blue screens of death and random shut downs. Do something, it asks you if you really want to do it way to often. Robs you of the beauty of the computer speed.
Some functions are fast, visually it is more interesting.; I do not use Windows email, search, etc. Mainly I download files I received via gmail, and the process of doing that now is way more complicated than with XP. It takes me twice as long to download files, text files for my work.
