friendly staff great location !

great hotel, great staff, great location not any problems what so ever .

wonderful hotel ,  excellent staff

the staff's professional, spirited attitude, , be they reservationist, valet, front desk, or housekeeper, , deserves 5 stars .

one of the friendliest desk concierge staffs i've encountered   .

the staff helped make our stay a great experience .

downsides are disinterested staff, bordering on rude and quite small rooms .

staff was neither especially helpful or unhelpful .

disappointed in front desk staff and room size

, pleasant staff, close to the wharf, just a few blocks to the cable car turnaround, pier 39 shopping,   ferry boat tours .
