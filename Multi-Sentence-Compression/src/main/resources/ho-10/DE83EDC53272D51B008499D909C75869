we had the twin room at the front of wren lodge on the ground floor which was nicely furnished , had a flat screen tv , tea and coffee making facilities and an en-suite shower room .

admittedly there were some querky aspects to the accommodation with a very small wash hand basin and the toilet tucked into a narrow gap between the shower cubicle and the wall , but neither of these features caused us a problem although it might for some .

all in all , we had a very enjoyable 2 nights stay at wren lodge and would encourage others to do the same .
wren lodge is within a 5 to 10 minute walk of st albans city centre and also local to the railway station .

to be honest , from the tripadvisor comments prior to our visit , we would not have booked to stay there .
