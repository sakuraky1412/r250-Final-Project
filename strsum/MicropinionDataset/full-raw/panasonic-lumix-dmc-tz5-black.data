positive experience with this brilliant camera ; travelling thousands of miles ; a hardy piece of kit with everything you need in a pocket size camera       10x zoom ; wide angle leica lens ; and lots more  .
this is my sixth digital point and shoot camera and is hands down the best i have ever owned  .
this is my first panasonic and based on the fun i have had with it over the past 5 weeks i can honestly say that unless something super amazing comes out in the future it may very well be the last digital point and shoot i buy  .
i love it .
for the money , you won't find a better camera  .
for those who are considering buying a cheaper camera in the $100    200 price range , save your money and buy this one instead , you wo not be disappointed  .
the camera has a lot of features , and you must take time to get to know the camera if you want to take full advantage of how super it is  .
the battery life is great , i can shoot all day and still have some battery left to make it home to the charger  .
i really love the 10x zoom , you can capture some great shots , even from nosebleed seats at a concert  .
i recently attended the madonna concert , and got some great shots in dark lighting with this camera  .
it also does well at the zoo , outdoor sporting events , etc  .
indoors , it does seem to lack a bit , but if you take the time to properly set the camera for your shot , you will almost always get a great photo  .
i have really shaky hands , and the only time the image stabilizer lets up is when i'm zooming in real close , otherwise it works great  .
i've even taken a lot of photos as a passenger in a moving car , and it does an excellent job of capturing the shot , even at 55mph  .
overall , this is the best camera i've owned , and you will love it .
i'm no fanboy of panasonic ; i'd never even heard of lumix before i started shopping for a new digital camera about a year ago  .
the blogs reported about 2 cameras that were coming out that shot hd video , a feature i absolutely wanted , this and the cannon  .
the tz5 also came with a 10x zoom , as well  .
this is definitely a rare feature , and i cannot remember how many times i cursed my old pentax for only having 3x  .
the icing on the cake is the availability to zoom while recording video  .
this feature is awesome and essentially makes your picture camera a camcorder the picture quality imo is amazing  .
i constantly get compliments about them , and am able to do a lot of cropping etc ; however , im sure most cams output good quality at 9mp  .
ill defer to cnet on that issue , but i'm certainly happy with it now things that annoy me   no optical viewfinder    meh i don't really miss one , but some ppl might be annoyed by it  .
in the camera's defense , the screen is super bright and super crisp (i think it is the highest resolution at the time)  .
no manual focus this one kinda upsets me  .
my old optios had a basic manual zoom function that i loved (i'm certainly no professional , but i'd consider myself a hobbyist)  .
alas , there is no manual focus here  .
in fact everything is pretty much automated for you  .
so if you don't know jack about cameras this is good for you , if not , you can change the iso , flash , focus settings , but no manual focus  .
no video camera light  .
i don't know any point and shoots that have this , but cmon ppl  .
i'd love to take video at night  .
finally , i think it shoots in h  .
264 , but i hate using quicktime , i'd rather it record to divx directly here are some example shots i've taken (last one is a video)    .

in summary , i absolutely love this camera , and could not recommend it more it has its shortcomings , but as point and shoots go i dont' see a better value  .
i shopped for a replacement for my optios for months and months and waited till this came around (if only it still fit in an altoids tin , lol)  .
so look at this and look at the cannon , but my money is on the tz5  .
i think this is the best compact digital camera on the market  .
i've read many reviews and the best pre    purchase is reading many of the forums which hundreds of real users posted their experience and actual pictures such as dpreview forums  .
i then realized things like the noise comments are camera nuts comparing this to a non compact camera  .
i am not a camera expert but the noise is over rated and in most cases barely noticable unless you blow it up over 8 x10 and that is only in limited conditions as the camera takes fabulous pictures  .
the zoom is incredible along with the wide angle lense  .
the menu is easy to use and the preset settings are very impressive with even a preset for fish tanks  .
i took a picture of my reef and no glare and the best aquarium photo i've ever taken  .
in summary this camera takes great pictures , great wide angle pictures , easy to use and the perfect travel camera  .
the hd video is nice for occasional use but the primary strength is the photo picture ability for wide angle , zoom , and vitually dummy proof capabilities  .
for the camera nuts you have to check out some of the dpreviews forum users whom have played with the settings to take magazine quality pictures  .
for those folks you can change white balance , iso , shutter speed , and other settings but for the average person the ia mode and presets makes it a perfect point and shoot  .
rechargeable battery lasts for about to 300 pictures before recharge  .
huge screen  .
if you love taking pictures , this is a great camera  .
i've been taking pictures for many years and i recommend it highly  .
no regrets on getting it .
i am tired of dragging around full size slr camera bodies and different lens'  .
i'm getting old enough now , that i do not like fiddling with f    stops , lenses , light meters , blah blah blah  .
i like to point and shoot and let the camera think for me  .
my daughter is in the advertising business (fortune 500 type) and she said the techies at her firm use the lumix in their stuff  .
but  .
i said , canon is rated best by consumer mags , the lumix is barely in the top 5  .
she said , who ya gonna believe  .
the magazine for college nerds , or the professionals that actually use it  .
i took her advice and have not been disappointed .
i'm a pretty avid photographer  .
i have three kids , two of them still in college and have taken literally almost 100 , 000 photos of their sporting events over the years  .
i've done photo web sites for all of their club , high school and college teams my primary still camera is a canon 40d which i love  .
also , i had purchased a canon hg20 because i wanted to take videos in high def  .
however , both of those are relatively big and bulky and i wanted something to put in my pocket to always have available when my big backpack camera bag was not at my side so , with some careful research i settled on the tz5  .
no , i don't have absolute control over the settings like my 40d , and i cannot attach my big beautiful l series lenses to it  .
and , no i cannot record an hour or two of continuous video in high def like i can on my hg20 with it's 60 gig hard drive but , i gotta tell ya folks , there's a lot to like about this $200 point and shoot camera  .
it takes excellent photos  .
the ability to have extreme wide angle to 10x zoom is something to be appreciated  .
i paid over $600 for a lens to to just that very thing on the 40d , and it is much heavier the fact that i can carry a camera in my pocket that can shoot in high def is the real reason that i bought this  .
my daughter plays major division 1 softball in college and most of my stills are still done with the 40d , but i find myself at a game whipping out the tz5 to take videos  .
the canon video camera is way over there sitting in my bag , too inconvenient to carry around no , i'm not one of those parents who plops a video camera on a tripod out in center field and records the whole game  .
who watches all that stuff anyway  .
i just want snippets of her at bat or playing shortstop with the sounds of the players doing cheers in the background  .
i'll leave the full game video taping to espn also , i find that because of the convenience of this camera i take photos that i'd never have taken before with the 40d  .
because it fits in my pocket , i keep it around all the time  .
photos at dinner or while we're out and about are much more convenient than trying to carry around an slr it came down to this camera and the canon g10  .
while the g10 has more features , including the ability to shoot in raw , the one feature it did not have is the ability to slip into my shirt pocket i highly recommend this camera a very nice point and shoot camera and it's also an excellent companion to an slr while also being a companion to a full sized video camera updated  .
on dec 12 , 2008  .
bottom line is if you are looking for a traveling camera to take solid , good    looking pictures , this is your buy  .
i usually set the dial on intelligent auto and let the camera take care of itself  .
however , there are enough preset functions built into the camera that i have not found a need to mess with too much of the nitty    gritty  .
i do have a complaint about the focus , but read about that above  .
the tz    5 gets my recommendation .
if looking for a camera that is small but has the flexibility to provide great zoom and a large lcd , this is the one  .
although the speed is not super fast , it is certainly manageable  .
the zoom is simply awesome  .
i traded this in for a five year old olympus camedia with 10x zoom , and its amazing how much better this camera is  .
picture quality is excellent  .
yes the microphone is on a bad spot , however if you want great video and sound capture , your probably not looking for a camera like this anyway .
good quality pictures , with a very inteligent flash for those nightime pictures  .
the zoom and wide angle lense , opens up a whole new world of framing your picture  .
the ia feature for auto selecting of best setting for a picture is very intuative to the extent that when you look at the pictures on your computer , the vast majority will be keepers  .
only had it for a week , but so far , no buyers remorse .
when i started looking at the market for digital cameras , i had three criteria   small form , good optical zoom , and hd video  .
my dad told me there's no such camera  .
well , come april , this camera is released and i had already been looking at it  .
10x optical zoom in such a small camera is amazing , and hd video on top of that  .
i wanted a small camera because i plan on doing some traveling , and i hate feeling like a geeky tourist having to pull out a big , awkward camera everywhere  .
this thing is sleek , beautiful , and nothing to be ashamed of showing off  .
the hd video amazes my friends and family  .
i plan on traveling in greece soon , and japan and korea in the future , and this will be the camera i take with me  .
i don't regret my purchase one bit that being said , there are some criticisms i will make , since some people want different things from a camera first , this camera is not good at shooting in low light , indoors , etc  .
it will up the iso , then run the photo through an in    camera noise filter , also removing/blurring some detail  .
i will use a tripod when shooting at night (which won't be often) and manually set the iso  .
of course , there's always flash second , when shooting video , if you use zoom , the microphone will pick up some of the internal noises (it's kind of loud ; big lens and all)  .
this is even more of a problem if you cover the microphone with your finger  .
so be careful and last , i can tell you that this camera wo not be the best at capturing high    speed situations in photos  .
but to counter that , i would just switch to video  .
there may still be some trouble with a lot of motion , but really it's give    and    take  .
you get a lot for your money , but you have to consider what situations you want to use this camera for i can honestly say that for the situations i want to use it in , this camera is perfect   huge zoom , wide angle lens , hd video , compact form  .
and did i mention decent price  .
by no means am i any photo pro , im just here to give my two cent and help some guy that wants it i bought the tz5 for a trip to negril jamaica knowing that alot of critics say this camera takes poor low light shots  .
while this is true i is blown away by the photos that did have suffient lighting i  .
on the sunny beaches  .
the images came out clear , sharp and naturally colorful  .
i had no problems with this camera as far as focusing issues or how quickly it starts up , which is fairly fast again i think that they can improve on low light quality and battery life other than that i think this is a great point and shoot cam and i like it .
in very sunny conditions the lcd screen is reflective so all you see is yourself  .
pictures are a complete shot in the dark          at least with older , less capable models the lcd just grayed out so that sometimes you could catch a glimpse of a shadow to center a shot  .
until they figure out a filter for sunlight o the lcd screen these cameras need a viewfinder  .
with relatively minor improvements , the tz3 could have been taking to the point of an effective pocketable substitute for a dslr but this camera is a step back from tz3  .
i would recommend purchasing the tz3 , not the tz5 1 ) the implementation of the macro a command dial control selection on the tz3 is quite inconvenient on the tz5 and the macro focus performs inconsistently 2 ) the product designers' kids must not play sports there is no tv ( shutter speed ) selection and the programmed sports mode is way too slow to capture action in most sports ( and no    one in pansonic tech assistance seems to know what the programmed shutter speed is ) 3 ) video capture is limited to 7 mins in best quality hd and 15 mins in sd great if your kids play 6 minute soccer games these limitations did not exist in the tz3  .
with 32 gb sdhc cards available , such limitations are unacceptable  .
moreover , avchd , increasingly supported by the industry ( and by pansonic ) would have been the better video format problems  .
as noted above , the tz5 is a step back from tz3 in terms of functionality notwithstanding the gain of 2 megapixels of resolution i recommend buying a tz3 which is an excellent camera  .
the tz5 should have improved on it , but failed to do so a big disappointment  .
i bought this camera because it works smoothly with my mac and because it shoots hd movies  .
i know the purists say you should have a dedicated movie camera if you are into shooting home video , but i find a good quality compact digital camera is much easier to carry around and less intimidating to your subjects when you're shooting footage at friendly gatherings  .
i have a sony dsc t100 which is an awesome little camera and created great video , but it doesn't interface well with my mac (no audio on movies) , and i have to run the footage through roxio program on my pc to convert to avi , then copy the avi files to my mac  .
tedious and time    consuming  .
i also wanted to upgrade to a compact digital that shot movies in hd  .
i like to use stills from my video footage in my finished imovies and hd video allows for pretty good stills  .
i loved so much about the dmc tz5 , but the audio for my finished movies is very poor compared to the sony  .
you can really only hear the person shooting the footage clearly (if he/she avoids covering the poorly    located microphone with his/her left index finger) , and you miss a lot of the dialogue of the subjects  .
this is a huge flaw if you're doing home movies , since some of the best audio comes from side comments and reactions       i'm not filming just to hear myself speak  .
i used the camera for a few weeks and did some short films on my mac , but i just could not get past the low volume of the audio track  .
the microphone barely picks up audio more than a couple of feet away  .
i did extensive research before buying the tz5 and did not see this issue mentioned anywhere  .
the superb quality of my sony may have spoiled me , but i had to send the lumix back  .
i may just stick to sony and hope the company eventually decides to play well with macs in the future .
we went to costco where we purchased the camera for $270  .
00 and they referred us to panasonic who said send the camera back to a texas address and we willl send you a refurbished camera for free  .
that is not the truth we got a letter stating the refurbished camera would cost $192  .
we called costco and a one hour exchange took place and the bottom line is we are getting our broken camera back and never buying a panasonic product again dropping out of our costco memembership there are more relieable stores to shop in  .
they should have given us a credit but this way they are willing to lose thousands of customers because at least 1 , 000 people pass through my office a month and this story will be posted in the waiting room for all to see .
if you have lot's of patience and are willing to deal with constant focusing and re    focusing (and the occasional out of focus shot when you review your vacation photos at home later) it does have a large zoom lens for a compact and some additional useful modes like night mode with extended shutter  .
my experience is that it is definitely not point and shoot as advertised  .
i took it back to the store .
battery good for 60 pics , awful screen in bright outdoors  .
