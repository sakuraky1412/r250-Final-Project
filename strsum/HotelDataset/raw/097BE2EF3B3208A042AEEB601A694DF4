though the hotel is large and used international brand like conrad .
but the staffs and service seems to be lack of experiences and unprofessional .
we booked the ocean view rooms with special request for upper floor confirming with the hotel staff by phone before we arrived 3 days and found that we got one room on first floor and another room on the third .
after complaining and negotiation for a while we wait for about 1 hour more then we get what we requested for .
the second disappointed issue is the quality of italian restaurant for both food taste and staff .
we had the worst lasagna ever here .
and the waitress seem to be ignorance of our order for example soup come after main course and when we asked if our soup was missed in order , she checked the kitchen and come back to said it 's still cooking as an excuse and the soup was so unpleasant taste .
another unplesant service is room service , we ordered bottles of beer and there is no cap opener in our room we did asked before ordered but the hotel 's staff insisted there was one cap opener in the room so when they come to serve we ask the staff to find it but there is really no cap opener in room .
we asked him to briing it but he just disappaered so we had to call again to get one .
staffs seem to . . .

rooms is spacious with good ocean view but not that spectacular seaview .
family with children may like the hotel as lots of choices for swimming pools but for those who wants good service , privacy , calm vacation this hotel is not a good choice.
