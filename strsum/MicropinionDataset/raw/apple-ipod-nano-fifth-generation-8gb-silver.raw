Pros:. It is everything that Apple is expected to be. 
Cons:. I do not want any. 
Summary:. But it?s more than that. I don?t like to lose a day without listening to atleast 1 tune of my playlist. Sort of completes my day. This ipod is a swanky little arm candy which carries an entire world of media.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small. FUN features. Video camera!. 
Cons:. Poor battery life. 
Summary:. I got my Nano 5 for Christmas.. This is probably the 2nd best Ipod, next to the Ipod touch. It's light, easy to use and it's great if your clumsy like me. The video camera quality is AMAZING. It's fairly easy to keep clean, doesn't smudge to easily. The only problem I had with mine was the headphone jack stopped working, But it was fixed easily and never happened again.. It has the cover flow selection which i love using. I had the 1st generation Nano, and that was a nice touch. When recording you can turn it any way you'd like. Bigger screen which is also great.. I strongly recommend the Nano 5 for first time Ipod buyers, and consumers who want an excellent device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cute pink color. Video recorder. Radio player. Step meter. Tiny. Crisp and clear videos.. 
Cons:. Battery life.. 
Summary:. God, Jesus Christ, is number one! He always give me good and never bad. This iPod is the best that I have had so far. I used to have the 160 gigabyte classic model, however, it did not have the beautiful pink color, the radio player, nor any of the other cute and tiny functions. You just have to own both of the items to realize that the classic, though able to hold much, is too bulky. With the iPod nano (5th generation), you eliminate much waste. People may tend to consider me sensitive because I am a guy who has such a tiny and cute device. However, I am the one who will be using the device and live with it. If I do it for others, then I would not be happy. I might be popular, but I would lose out on the real joy of fulfilling my needs. So, no matter what I say here about the cutie pie pink iPod nano 5th generation, make your own choice. Go through all the models at the Apple store if you have to, but be sure it is what you want and not for show. Sure, Apple is the most recognized. Zune may be bulky and ugly to me, but who cares. Go get one if that is what you really want. Now... down to my review of the iPod, here. I have had the chance to take this iPod on the road with me as well as keep it at home. It is an additional component that you have to account for. I had to fit everything into my limited two pocket jeans. Because I only had room if I put everything in one of the pocket, it ended up scratching the screen a little. Both my iPod and my camera suffered. Bringing these items along is not worth it. Life is better when you share it with your love ones. That is what I have learned from my short vacation. I have learned that when your love is far away, everything is no fun.. 

$$;
Pros:. EVERYTHING. 
Cons:. NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE IPOD NANO 5TH GENERATION. 
Summary:. Everything is great. 

$$;
Pros:. Itunes lets you customize exactly where your songs begin and end.. Audio crossfade feature gives your music playback a great DJ effect which is unique to the Nano.. Compact package, yet it has a crisp video playback with ability to record on-the-fly. 
Cons:. Such a "hot" item, that it can leave you paranoid and insecure that someone is going to steal it.. Would be nice if it had more games available in Itunes.. No wifi like the touch.. 
Summary:. If sound, multia-media playback, ability to customize your catalog and content, as well as looks count, then this device will surely satisfy you and your crowd for a long time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features for music playback and video playback loaded up with all the extras that you'd be finding in your average smart phone, Excellent video camera quality with cool effects. Very cool ultra slim sized.. 
Cons:. Shake to shuffle feature got a bit annoying and video camera is in the most random place so holding like a normal camera was not a good idea.. 
Summary:. The IPod nano 5G is so fare the best portable media player I've had loaded up with all the cool extras like rotatable games, video camera with effects, great LCD screen and all extra features. i recommended this PMP for everyone it is so coooooooooooooooooool. 

$$;
Pros:. It's very portable and easy to hold. One of my favorite ipods. (the other is the itouch) I couldn't ask for more. considering the size of the screen, it still had crisp clear images and amazing new features such as the video camera.. 
Cons:. The screen is a little small and not really "anti-glare". battery life shortened by about 2 hrs.. 
Summary:. This product was great. It fits anywhere-pockets,purses,backpack and it's light and portable. The rounded shape of this Ipod allows you to easily grasp it and not slip. The screen isn't as anti-glare and the screen is quite small, but other than that, it's a great Ipod. If you want to buy an ipod with nice features, sleek design and is light and portable, then the iPod nano is the perfect ipod for you. The font size can be changed, thus allowing people with poor eyesights to read without any issues. there's also a voice feature that allows the ipod to speak to you. I bought this, and loved it. definately worth the money. some people might perfer the 3rd generation shape, but this shape fitted extremely well in the palm of my hands, and it was easier to grasp. Basically, this ipod has sleek designs, a nice range of colors and great features. Buy it. You'll heart it.. 

$$;
Pros:. The device itself is beautiful and the display is unmatched on this scale. It's really amazing just how big the screen is on such an incredibly thin device. The video works very well for such a small sensor and it is so easy and convenient to use.. 
Cons:. None so far except that the new glossy finish does capture fingerprints more than the old, matte finish 4G Nano. But it is not incredibly noticeable.. 
Summary:. This is definitely the best iPod I've ever owned. I have an iPhone so I wasn't too sure if I would want another iPod, but after having this little guy and using it to work out I don't think I'll ever use my iPhone while I work out again because this thing is so incredibly small, thin, and light. The addition of an FM radio is also fantastic because I love switching to the radio sometimes, or if you're on a treadmill, bike, etc... at the gym then you can tune this guy to the gym televisions, which is phenomenal. The UI is so smooth and beautiful and the accelerometer is, dare I say it, better and faster than the iPhone's (but it doesn't have all the data to compute that the iPhone does). The video sensor is at a little bit of an awkward place on the back (right where the hand would sit naturally), but that's definitely not a deal breaker. The speaker and the audio playback without headphones are surprisingly good. I played some John Mayer in my bedroom and had to turn it down because it was too loud (but in a relatively quiet environment). This is an amazing little device and I highly recommend it to anyone who is thinking about their first iPod or replacing and old iPod or wanting something a little less cumbersome than the iPhone at the gym.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the the enlarged screen and the live radio pause feature. Also the video feature and the speakers but it could be better.. 
Cons:. I wish it had better sound quality when it comes to playing videos or music aloud.. 
Summary:. I like it but it can still be improved.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large crisp and large display, Battery life is long enough lasting a day and half in one full charge. Polished Aluminum Material which obviously doesn't look cheap. High-end iPod. Video Cam is pretty useful and clear enough in daylight use. Best Nano. 
Cons:. Although some consumer would complain about the polished screen because it is prone to smudges and finger prints. Getting a case would solve this problem and would protect the iPod and it's pretty much PERFECT! ^^. 
Summary:. I bought a the silver one of this product-line. The device looks shiny polished and it has the neat clean looking among any other MP3 player.. The Screen. It is bright or should i say it's over powered by brightness. since at just 10% brightness it would is enough for me to view the display and going at 100% brightness would burn your eyes and could be your flashlight in dark room. imagine that's how bright the screen is. Beside of that what i love about this display is how Crisp and Sharp it is you won't experience any blurred text or images so does video's or umm not unless you downloaded a real blurred down size image.. Unibody or the device itself. In any color you get Polished design like a glossy shiny device made of aluminum this is pretty useful from scratches but kinda a cons for the polished display since the whole device itself is polished. The screen is prone to smudges and finger prints getting a screen protector would solve this problem. The good thing in this design it's not a cheap looking product even from the previous iPod's it never looked cheap. overall i love the design for me there's nothing wrong with it.. The Speaker. don't expect the speaker would be your amplifier or will be your portable speaker if you want background music while having conversation cause it's not powerful as mobile phone speakers. would be useful as an alarm speaker if you can wake easily or your iPod will keep beeping the whole day and your super late in your work. speaker somehow useful somehow not.. Video Cam , Let clear this out it's only a video cam there is no Capturing feature for images maybe because apple decide to add this feature in the 6th Gen nano &gt;,&gt; as usual. The video cam i pretty impressive useful and record video clearly in sunny and daylight condition because in night your screen would turn black as you can't see anything using in dark areas or night there is no night mode so you just get a video cam. For me it's Useful addition for an MP3 Player reason it's worth it.. Mp3 quality- or music quality, It deliver the Pro quality and it somehow reduces the buzzing and it enhance the clarity comparing from other Mp3 players it's like the quality you get from all iPhone and iPod products.. I recommended getting and pairing Dr. Dre Earphone's which cost the more than this but offers the maximum MP3 set it's like it's a MUST-Have to complete your Music experience cause it sounds like High Definition in your ears like the singer is singing in front of you that could be possible using Dr. Dre tour Earphone's. Although the Headset comes with the iPod is fine but it doesn't deliver the sound as what Dr. Dre's earphone offers and sometimes it's uncomfortable for ears cause the headset came with the iPod is wearing-off all the time for me.. The Capacity, 8GB and 16GB ranges is Huge and won't easily be filled so it's enough and pretty much plenty.. Newer additions feature from previous iPod Nano.. Video Cam.. FM Radio.. VoiceOver. - It is something like a narrator which tells you the title of the song and artist. it's like the iPod is speaking. Pedometer. For jogging or walking recording feature which tells you how far you walked from where you activate it.. And you would find more impressive feature after you have the device.. Bottom-line.. It's worth what you pay for, long lasting device. strong durable and reliable. Ultra fast performance.. Great design. totally worth for what your pay for.. But for some it would be heavy in your pocket i recommend having an iPod if you are really a music lover you live in this world to listen to music then don't think any other product range other than iPod. and having Dr. Dre earphone is perfect match for this device it's like the ultimate music set in your ears. And you pick the color you love. It's great works great and almost perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its a great Ipod. By far the best nano. Small and sturdy. Video Camera included, radio, games, calendar, alarm etc. Thin. Extremely durable. Alright pricing. Best place to buy is at Best Buy, not apple store. That saves you $10 on a protector for it.. 
Cons:. The controls are very sensitive. Screen can get dirty and scratched easily so a screen protector is HIGHLY recommended.. 
Summary:. Its very very thin! My old samsung was horrible, so I had to buy an Ipod because all my music and videos worked with Itunes very well. Its small, its even got a video camera!! Its got games and lots of cool gadgets for working out, calendars, alarm clocks, a cool menu system, and here's my favorite part, you dont even need headphones! There is a bult in speaker! The screen is just Gigantic!!! Its amazing what apple did to this ipod. This is a great product, however, you might need the 16GB because I regret getting the 8GB because im running low on space. If you have lots of videos and songs, get the 16GB. There are a few downsides though. The control buttons are VERY sensitive, and sometimes annoying. The screen can get dirty so buying a protector case is recommended. I ran into a problem in the beginning of corrupting the Ipod, but I found out that YOU NEED TO EJECT YOUR IPOD BEFORE DISCONNECTING IT. A great product. I do recommend this product.. 

$$;
Pros:. User friendly, not too small, good battery life.. 
Cons:. haven't found anything yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. -an outstanding video camera. -plays HD videos. -exact size of 4th gen. -glossy finish. -affordable(because of features). -great sound quality. -24 hour s of music. -has a radio + live play/pause. -GREAT video quality. 
Cons:. -camera's in bad place. -small click wheel. -radio reception not too good. -have to use iTunes(as always). 
Summary:. this mp3 player is almost worth it just for the excellent camera, this camera has auto-focus, x-ray(for you sicko's...lol), and lots of other features.... (everything else is in the "pro and con" thing!). 

$$;
Pros:. Very small and portable, good sound and video quality, radio, video camera. 
Cons:. Bad placement of the camera with no option to take photos. 
Summary:. I just got the ipod nano a week ago, and so far I am very pleased. It not only has good music and video playback, but it now has a video camera. I have already taken several videos. Though the video camera certainly isn't professional quality, it's good for anyone looking to make a youtube video. Unfortunately, Apple decided to place it right where I tend to hold the ipod, so I have to make a conscious effort not to hold it there. For some reason, this camera can't take photos either, which is a bit of a disappointment. Overall, I am pleased with the camera, though. It also has a good radio, with the option of live pause, which can be useful if you're in the middle of your favorite song and need to go to the bathroom or something. Overall, I am very pleased with my ipod.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Small and light enough to always carry. - Fully featured for a mini (music, movies, video and voice recording, fm radio) at a reasonable price point. - Beautiful. - Easy navigation. 
Cons:. - 16gigs on the small side.. 
Summary:. I have an IPOD classic, but wanted something that I could carry around everywhere. This is an awesome machine for that purpose. I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Apple has finally added am FM Radio,which was a feature I was waiting for a very long time. The camera is also a nice addition (great quality btw), as is the pedometer (reasonably accurate) and the speaker (not perfect, but it works).. 
Cons:. The only shortcoming was the fact that you can't take pictures with it. Who's heard of a camera that can't take pictures? Other than that nothing else is wrong with it.. 
Summary:. I love my new iPod nano. I highly recommend this product to those who don't want an iPod Touch or an iPhone, but want a decent MP3 player. The iPod nano fit this role a long time ago, but now the 5G has MUCH more.. 

$$;
Pros:. IT DOES EVERYTHING PROMISED, ALMOST. 
Cons:. How do I get the radio to function on my Bose docking station ???. 
Summary:. Functions and navigation through various menus and operations intuitive .. 

$$;
Pros:. small size, quality of video, integration with Apple software. 
Cons:. placement of camera lens. 
Summary:. I regularly carry this camera in one of my classes where students learn evaluation techniques. I love the ability to capture a short sequence demonstrating the "proper" technique and quickly upload it to a server or website for the entire class to use. For my needs, the perfect combination of size and performance.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, great camera qulaity. 
Cons:. Little more storage would be nice. 
Summary:. Buy it! http://www.ipod-depot.com has some good prices. 

$$;
Pros:. well... just about everything. 
Cons:. the only regret I would have is having a camera that can't take any stills... is this so??. 

$$;
Pros:. shiney, small, video camera. 
Cons:. doesnt take pictures, bad quality videos, cant upload videos on a pc correctly.. 
Summary:. i've had my fair share of ipods, 9 to be exact, all nanos down the the 2nd generation, this one has to be the best by far. i was so excited when i saw it came in so many colors for the same price and it takes videos!. everythings great about it besides the face that it takes a genius to upload the videos on to your pc, and it comes in mp4 format, which is weird on pc's. it also doesnt take pictures, which was deppressing.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love that it has videos, click wheel games, slim design, touch wheel, screen is big.. 
Cons:. Awkward position of where the lens are, does not take pictures. 

$$;
Pros:. Perfect Size, new FM Radio feature, decent video quality, great sound quality. 
Cons:. Short battery life, can't listen to music while charging battery, video camera but no picture camera, poor reception on FM radio. 
Summary:. I chose the Nano over the iTouch because of the size, and the fact that I would never use most of the game and video features on the iTouch. I love the new size, it fits perfectly into a back pocket. The new FM radio feature is great, although I have difficulty getting reception for many stations that I usually have no problem with on other FM radios. The battery life isn't the greatest - it lasts a good work day, but I have to stop and re-charge after about 10 hours of use. I've also found that you can't actually use the Ipod while it's charging. I found it a little weird that you can shoot video on it, but can't take still pictures. You can store pictures on the Nano, but can't take them.. seems like Apple could have taken it a little further there. The video quality is surprisingly pretty decent considering the size of the Nano. Sound quality is excellent as usual with Apple products. Overall I'm pretty happy with my purchase, but there are a few things I think can be improved.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the new pedometer feature with "Fitness" submenu that lives in the Nano's "Extras" directory. Awesome idea to have the iTunes prompt you after it sees you've used the pedometer, to track your progress on the Nike+ Web site.. 
Cons:. What do I do with my old ipod :(. 
Summary:. Real nice new features but having just bought my ipod less than a year ago, I wish I could at least get some credit towards the new more advanced ipod; gail &lt;a href="http://dietinstitute.net/2009/08/gail-slim/"&gt;slim&lt;/a&gt;. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the color of the blue, screen, sound quality, video. 
Cons:. don't like the finish, it scratches easy so does the screen, and the camera lens. If you drop it on the top the hold button comes loose, and cause it is one sheet of metal it buckles when dropped so my click wheel is falling out. get the 3rd gen!!!. 
Summary:. Ok camera no purpose in the cover flow to confusing when you tilt it cause it panics. the voices sounds like shes constipated. 

$$;
Pros:. sleek. great sound. great screen.. 
Cons:. battery life is so much worse than gen4.. 
Summary:. if you don't need the video, stick with ur old ipod. battery life isterrible.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek, high capacity, larger screen, pedometer.. 
Cons:. Charging compatibility - limited range of charging options. More below.. Video Camera was only so-so. Audio on the videos was even worse. Camera location?...what the hell were they thinking?. 
Summary:. I was excited to open up my new ipod. I got it mainly for the larger capacity to get more of my newly beloved Apple Lossless songs onto a smaller device. This excitement was short lived because I found a few things to hate pretty quickly.. First and foremost, this new Nano is not compatible with the charging function of my 2009 VW's built-in ipod dock. 2009!! It can't be obsolete already. Not only did it not charge, it actually seemed to suck battery life out of the ipod taking what should be a 24-hour play cycle and turning it into 45 minutes. I thought I had a battery problem until I researched it more. I thought, "leave it to Apple to marginalize their own product line from a year ago to force you into all new accessories." Evidently, many charging and syncing products use Firewire as a connection instead of the standard USB. Apple conveniently left the Firewire portion out of the 4th Generation nano (I was replacing a 3rd gen, so I didn't know).. In short, Apple gets a wag of the finger from my car charger and car dock.. Second on my anticipation list was the video camera. I had heard about the questionable location of the actual camera, but I thought "how bad could it really be?" It's bad. It's right where you want to hold the thing. It makes it hard to film something and actually see what you're filming simultaneously which ultimately defeats its cool factor.. Beyond that, it's your standard iPod nano. Sleek, chic, compact, cool, and functional. Graphics were clean and crisp. Organization as simple as ever. The pedometer was a great addition. If I never listened to it in the car, I would have loved it. But given how much time I do spend in my car, I can't overlook the glaring inability to sync and charge at the same time, which is why for me, it's only a 3-star product. If you have a USB based sync in your car, you're probably ok but research it before you buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light weight, cool color, bigger screen. 
Cons:. Ipod swiched the earphone hole and dock hole, so now you have to buy new accessories. Bluetooth adaptor no longer works!!bluetooth. 
Summary:. Well to start, I bought the (PRODUCT)Red Ipod nano 16gb. Have to promote AIDS awareness. I used to use a motorola bluetooth adaptor with my sony bluetooth headphones. Now the bluetooth does not transmit sound to the headphones, but i can still control the play/pause and track skip.. (does anyone know if there is afix for this?) I am pissed that i cant use the bluetooth, and now have to use WIRED headphones like the rest of you... But besides this, its a great ipod. 

$$;
Pros:. Great UI, tons of features. Cover Flow is excellent to use. Video is easy and straightforward to use. Amazingly lightweight, especially compared to the competition.. 
Cons:. Converse to its lightness, the nano has a rather unsubstantial feel to it. Color (purple) doesn't come close to matching the image on Apple's website, or the TV ads. VERY mediocre sound quality out-of-the-box; is Apple EVER going to improve on this?. 
Summary:. We ordered a 16GB 5G unit direct from Apple for one in our household to replace her filled 3G 'stubby' nano; the local Apple Store still hadn't received their initial batch at the time. The intended one chose purple as her color of chose based on the images on Apple's website; was disappointed when the unit arrived. Color was far darker than advertised, though to my eyes was still rich and lush with the new gloss coating (but then I'm easier to please).. Despite the similarly sized click wheel to the 3G nano, the 5G's is easier to operate, I think because of the 5G's long body. Response is fluid and seemless, with no hesitation or jerkiness that the 3G sometimes would exhibit. Menu orientation is standard Apple (e.g., easy-to-use and logical in its presentation). This thing does tons of things, and most exceeding well. That said, the accelerometer seems 'sticky' at times. The hold switch on the top of the unit is rather dainty; with the DLO 5G clear shell on it pays to have small fingers to get access to it.. Video looks good to great on the player, but the display washes out severely in bright ambient light; not a convincing OLED competitor here. The 5G is incredibly lightweight; I compare it against my old 2G nano and I'm really surprised at the difference. That said, I feel that there's also a loss in the 'feel' of the player as a result; there's not feeling of solidity with the 5G, a "substantialness" and confidence in the build-quality that a certain amount of weight brings, despite the aluminum housing that the 5G comes in.. Pack-ins are standard fare these days; less-than-enthusiastic toss-in ear buds, a dock insert, proprietary 30-pin iPod USB cable, all in a clear plastic case that is the same size if not identical as the one my 2G nano came in (when compared side-to-side).. The video camera and mic are neat, though CNET is right: the video quality isn't going to set the world ablaze. That said, it IS a neat feature that I know is going to make someone in our household quite pleased, even if the one on her camera does video recording better. The FM tuner is really nice; FINALLY Apple has addressed this particular oversight and built-in an FM tuner rather than trying quite unconvincingly to burden users with the extra-hassle, extra-cost extension cable tuner. I've had one of those and I rarely ever bothered to pull it out to use on my old iPods, instead reaching for my Zune or X-Fi instead when I wanted radio. The 5G nano's FM section is easily a match to the one on my Zune 8 and 80 units; simply put, it's simple, straightforward and a pleasure to use.. Many of the extra features seem quite nice; I'm sure the Nike+iPod will get a thorough working out (no pun intended), as will the pedometer and perhaps the stopwatch. Games, at least to me, are less-than-convincing...mostly because the click wheel wasn't the best gaming all-around interface from my past experiences on my old 80GB 5.5G iPod. While the calendar and contacts function is nice, I doubt that they'll ever be used since it doubles up on functions already being used on the cellphone. The built-in speaker is rather pathetic-sounding, but I suppose some might find it appealing in a pinch.. But I saved the worst for last: the biggest gripe I have with this latest generation nano is one that I have with almost all iPods in general: middling at best audio sound quality. This iPod doesn't go any way AT ALL at improving the breed, even if the 'random play' shake is oh-so-cute, cross-fading is nice, and the player does have some usable functions, like its ability to show how much storage is available. Compared to the new 16GB Sony Walkman S545 that my wife recently bought, Apple frankly should be put off by the obvious discrepancy in audio quality, particularly keen for a player that my wife a little over $100 for during the Sony Style store's recent Labor Day promotion. Sure the Sony S has its own issues, but for over $75 less most of those can be dealt with and certainly great-sounding audio is not one of those she'll be concerning herself with. As for iTunes 9...well it works on my old XP media machine. So far nothing has broken (fingers crossed), like the early versions of 7 and 8 did. My 2G Touch seems to work fine with it, as does a couple of earlier iPods I've tried (such as the previously mentioned 3G nano, for instance).. I'm sure that there are plenty of other niceties that I've overlooked (like voice recording, for instance); this nano does pack plenty of functions in for the money. But for me, it's ALWAYS been about the music itself; the lackluster audio quality that Apple too often seems so oblivious to is THE one aspect that will for ever make me question my own 'next purchase' for any future PMP/DAP device. As much as I like the functionality of my Touch, I rarely use it for music so it seldom goes anywhere with me. Other brands may have other issues, but where it counts I invariably will go elsewhere.. 3 stars, due of the SQ flaws.. 

$$;
Pros:. I tunes and a good support system. All I pods are easy to get movies onto. Size, camera.. 
Cons:. FM Tuner and microphone that most other players had years ago. Still missing codecs like Flac, WMA, OGG, etc. Camera. 
Summary:. Though they still have a good support system with I-Tunes I don't see much change. I don't think most people will need a pedometer. FM other systems had years ago. I would have liked to see HD radio along with FM to compete with the Zune HD. most players had microphones years ago also. Creative players had a speakers for a while now. My wife has a Zen Mosaic with a speaker and my daughter has a Zen stone plus with one. The camera though fun isn't really needed. Maybe without that they could drop the price under $100. The aluminum casing rocks and the display is awesome. It just seems to me with the exception of the touch it's the same old same old. I would still love to see a removable and changeable battery so I could keep one charged and be able just to swap it out if I am somewhere and can't wait to charge it. But since most of the industry is going that way (sigh) I guess it's not a feature that will be implemented anytime soon.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the styling and the many color choices. it is quite a lot faster than the 2nd edition nano which i had before this one.. the large screen is also very useful for watching movies on. first ipod to have radio without the stupid add-on. 
Cons:. The speaker has a low sound quality, the albums menu shows an album as many times as there are artists in that album. It has a useless camera, and the connector doesn't connect properly to the ipod. Coverflow looks a bit useless.. 
Summary:. I'm comparing this ipod to my first ipod, the 2nd generation nano. In my opinion the new 5th gen is more a fashion object than it is a mp3/4 player. it feels a lot less sturdy than the 2nd gen, it feels plasticky en the screen feels like you could scratch it any second.The quality feels much worse, because of the smaller, less-sensitive click wheel, the speaker that distorts sound at even 25% volume, and the fact that your itunes must be updated regularly to the latest version, which on windows, is an incredible pain. I doubt it will last as long as my last one (4 years). A con on the other hand is the camera which has a very nice framerate, but the fact it is located at the bottom of the player means the lens will get dirty very easy from your hand. If you really like Apple then go ahead and buy it but i wish i would have blown my money on something else. 

$$;
Pros:. Loaded with features.. 
Cons:. Unacceptable sound quality. 
Summary:. The video recorder is fantastic, the voice recorder is fantastic...everything about the new Nano is fantastic except for the one thing that is supposed to be the main reason for this device's existence: The sound quality is very poor.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Functions nicely with dial.. -Genius works okay although it still needs some tweaking.. 
Cons:. -Battery lasted 23 months. Unit will no longer charge and/or it doesn't recognize the battery altogether. Apple Genius Bar would not provide required paperwork for Credit Card Claim.. 
Summary:. This product is not worth the investment considering it's planned obsolecence with battery life.. 

$$;
Pros:. well,in our household we have had the classic, have the shuffle and Touch and have no problems. We bought the 5th gen for our 7 year old daughter because she loves to listen to music,play games and capture moments w/video.. 
Cons:. compact, cute colors,video and holds enough on an 8 gig.. 
Summary:. Since Christmas day, we have returned the 1st one because it doesnt turn on. I dont know if its because the charge stinks or it was the model. I exchanged it for another one and on our 3rd day with the 2nd one the same issues. Now, i am thinking we should go to the apple store?! would it make any difference??. i purchased it brand new at walmart because they had a special with a free $50.00 i tunes card. I dont know, im extremely upset and our daughter cant enjoy her gift. She wanted to upgrade from the DS to the DSI and i convinced her to go for the nano. It is SUPPOSE TO DO SO MUCH MORE than not turn on... Im not happy with it and have tried other ways of charging both of the nanos... Any suggestions??. 

$$;
Pros:. radio, camera. 
Cons:. same old ipod nano with poor battery life. 
Summary:. I guess when i waited for apples new release of the new nano for months just to find a camera, its a little disappointing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Old, simple, UI.. 
Cons:. None of your former accessories will work.. 
Summary:. They added crap (ie. the video/photo option...really....are you going to use this??) and made it so 3rd party apps/accessories don't work (ie. Winamp, hardware accessories, etc).
