Pros:. Great res,Small. 
Cons:. none that I can find. 
Summary:. stop wasting your time looking for a camera....this is the best you will find for 250. 

$$;
Pros:. Many new feature over the SD700 IS.. 
Cons:. Would like a bit of internal memory. 
Summary:. I have an SD700IS and love it. When I read about the SD850IS I decided to upgrade. I keep the SD700IS in the car for a backup when there is that special picture I just have to have and the 850 is at home. The SD850IS has lots of features I really like over the 700 but none equal the brighter LCD screen. It's completely visable in the brightest sunlight now. The menu system has changed for the better. Two many changes to it to detail here. The SCRATCH RESISTANT LCD screen is great also. The extra mega pixels are NICE but what I really like is being able to use SDHC cards for longer video. I know cNet dislikes the ON/OFF button. I have no prob with it. I like not being able to hit it by mistake. If you don't have a finger nail on your thumb it could be a bit hard to activate. One thing I'd really like this camera to have is a few MB's of internal memory. I use card readers to view my shots and I can't tell you how many times I go to take a shot of the cat or a sunset only to discover I don't have a memory card in the camera. The manual is long. So what? If you want a point and shoot camera that can't do much of anything special buy a Kodak.. 

$$;
Pros:. face detection. 
Cons:. yet to figure it out. 

$$;
Pros:. size, picture quality, zoom, ease of use. 
Cons:. nothing really noteworthy. 
Summary:. I looked all over for the right camera. I wanted great picture quality in a small package. I also did not want to sacrifice zoom. I did a great deal of research (solid 2 months). I finally settled on the SD850 and it did not disappoint. It takes great point and click pictures while being small enough to fit into a packet and not be intrusive.. Now here's the great thing: i took some great pictures at a football game. This was at Heinz Field in the club section, which was about mid-level of the stadium. The zoom worked real well. My picture quality did not suffer. The pics looked as if I took them from the sideline. My buddy has a much larger camera with a 12X zoom. This camera does not do that, of course. But it's good enough to get by while still being small and light enough to carry with you without a hassle. Big thumbs up. Mine was $350 so price is an issue but I don't think you'll be upset at paying extra. The ones I evaluated in the $100-300 range were nowhere near as good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, ease of use and multiple pre-set scenes.. 
Cons:. No fast way to delete multiple pictures. 
Summary:. This is a great camera for the price. Other cameras around the same price do not have the same picture quality. The screen is vivid and very responsive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything!!!!!!!!. 
Cons:. No camera case, also memory card that comes with the camera is small. 
Summary:. I know nothing about cameras. I bought this camera simply on CNET recomendation and let me tell you this baby doesn't disappoint! ALL features are easy to figure out and use. I really like the movies it takes as well. I bought a 2 gig memory card which is what this baby needs. If you want a compact camera that takes great pics in all types of light and that also you can put in your pocket/purse so you'll never miss those special moments than this is the camera for u.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, fantastic action shots even with flash, great indoor shots. 
Cons:. I don't see any yet. 
Summary:. I have the Canon PowerShot S1 IS with 10X optical zoom which I bought a couple of years ago. Two of my boys are pitchers in baseball and I wanted a great camera to catch the sequence of their pitching with no blurry pictures. It is a great camera. People are jealous of my action shots. I bought the canon 850 because I'm going on a trip and I wanted a smaller camera. This one might become my main camera. I had my kids move as fast as they could (indoors) with a flash to test the clarity of the pictures. All I can so is wow!!! I love this camera. I wouldn't bring my other camera to events sometimes because it's a little bit bulky but now I won't miss a shot. Don't go for the super slim cameras because you lose quality. This one will fit in you pocket just fine. Spend a little more $$ and get quality with this one. I read one review that it doesn't take good pictures inside and the only thing I can think of is they must not know what they are doing because I couldn't take a bad picture on auto if I tried. Very happy with my camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Did I say EZ ? Crisp Clear Pics. Macro like a pro - make videos on the fly. Fits your palm like a 6th finger - shall I go on???. 
Cons:. Can't go anywhere without it.. 
Summary:. I've wasted a pretty penny over the years too lazy to master fairly expensive 4 me cameras. I just wanted to have fun with a camera - not work.. Viola - I stumbled onto this Elf on the Paneristi watch forum and am a fan 4 life.. 

$$;
Pros:. FAST, EXCEL. IMAGES,+1 HOUR OF EXCEL. VIDEO. FACE DETECT. ALSO USES FLASH!. 
Cons:. NONE SO FAR!. 
Summary:. LOOK OUT COMPETITORS! the sd 850IS has it all. excellent images, fast, easy to use and canon quality! the face detection,(industries best) uses the flash(sd 800IS, et al do not!), not just focus and exposure to illuminate darkened faces. Hmmm. seems like that's long overdue and it locks on fast. the optical image stabilization (industries best),zoom lens and face detection works on stills AND video, others don't. speaking of video, want a camera AND camcorder in one? this baby records up to 1 hour of quality video that is currently only limited by the 4gb cards, larger cards coming. the direct print button can also be assigned to instantly record video regardless of camera setting mode. how cool is that? while taking snapshots, just push the button and grab video, too! wicked cool!. REBUKING OTHER REVIEWERS:the sd850IS's lens opens as wide or wider than other cameras, but the sd800IS has a "wide angle lens",ALSO the sd800IS has less megs and a lesser quality face detection. the on/off button is just fine and easy to use, but would be very hard to accidentily turn on/off(that's a good thing!. SUMMATION: image/video/lcd screen quality are excellent. packed with intuitive,pertinet features that the camera automaciticly segregates into what's available depending on shooting mode. fit and finish is attractive(use the wrist strap). we love this camera! what else do i have to say?. BUY IT!!! YOU'LL LOVE IT TOO!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick turn on time, fast access to SD card and battery, excellent resolution and color. 
Cons:. A case would be nice, however I bought 5 IPOD cases for $5 that look like little socks that work perfectly. 
Summary:. I've owned this camera for about a year and am still amazed at all the features. It takes great pictures! It takes movies and time lapse pictures. I've programmed the printer button on the back to take movies so if I'm taking stills and a movie situation arises I just press the button and I'm taking movies! It's small enough that I carry it in my shirt pocket everywhere I go. I can have it out of my pocket, (and sock case) turned on and taking pictures in just a couple of seconds. I take lots of pictures and I hardly ever miss one now thanks to the quick turn on time. It also has a continuous shoot mode - just hold the shutter button down and it takes pictures until the memory card fills or you release the shutter button. I found a good deal on 1G SD cards at Calumet Photo. I bought 2 extra batteries and carry about 6 1G SD cards and the extra batteries in my pocket. I can shoot all day with that setup. I have a Canon Digital Rebel that I used to take everywhere I went. That camera with the 28-135 IS lens and battery grip weighs about 3.5 lbs. The 850 weighs about 7 oz - quite a bit lighter! You can fix redeye right in the camera through the menus. You can set the exposure + or - 2 stops in manual mode. There are so many features that the user guide is 161 pages (and well written also). I would highly recommend this camera for anyone wanting a really good point and shoot camera!. 

$$;
Pros:. Size of camera. Lens quality &#38; 4X zoom. Has viewfinder. Took excellent photos. Sharp, large LCD. IS &#38; Facial recognition. In-camera red-eye correction. 
Cons:. Doesn't have manual focus capability. LImited manual controls. 

$$;
Pros:. Speedy shots. Better than most in low light and at night. panoramic mode rocks!. great steady photos even when you are not so steady. 
Cons:. Battery compartment horribly designed. Can't tell battery is about to die until it's too late. 
Summary:. I used this camera as I backpacked around Europe for two months. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple to use point-and-shoot that takes excellent photos. Quick turn on so you can get shots in a heartbeat. Sturdy design with the exception of the battery compartment - that could use some work. The steady shot works like a charm. I was often shaky or just plain not careful when taking pictures and they came out phenomenally (as I pat myself on the back).. Now the bad points. Well, visually, there are no issues. I took pictures in tremendously varying conditions, always with fantastic results. My qualms are with the battery/memory card door latch. It is too easily opened and awkwardly placed on the bottom of the camera right where my finger goes thus causing it to open occasionally. Also, not having a full time batter monitor was an oversight on Canon's part. I was able to use the camera for about 2 days of solid use before needed to recharge, unfortunately you don't know that it needs to be recharged until it's too late. My advice: buy a cheapo extra battery on eBay and keep it with you on extended trips.. One tip for low lighting conditions: use manual mode and keep the aperature open slightly longer than usual. Also, I found that the setting that brings out reds (not sure what mode this is called offhand but you will know when you see it) is a great little trick for taking pictures at night.. You really can't go wrong with this model. I have no regrets about the purchase and would undoubtedly recommend it to friends, family and you!. 

$$;
Pros:. small size, fast to first shot, vivid colors. 
Cons:. Didn't have enough time to find cons. 
Summary:. I purchased this camera at the end of April and have enjoyed the photo quality, convenience of video shooting and beautiful display until it came crashing to the floor and the lens broke. I took this camera to the zoo, outdoor political rallies, camping, family events, and more. I have been VERY happy with the quality, external playback microphone, and editing abilities. I purchased an 8GB card and didn't have to erase anything. This all came to an end when I was using the video mode and my son (whose head was hidden inside a pillowcase) accidentally smacked the camera out of my hands and onto the floor. Since the camera was on, the lens extensions became dislocated in the fall and now it won't turn on. I think I will purchase a new one and figure out what to do with the broken one. This is such a great camera!. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp images, fast shutter. 
Cons:. ZoomBrowser software nice but took time to learn, maybe easier for others. 
Summary:. Easier to use than expected. Transitioned abruptly from a Canon Sure Shot Z180u with about 700 great photos with first use on India trip.. My wife is very fussy about our camera performance and she is most pleased. I go back as far as heavy, back-breaking SLRs and can state that picture quality did not disappoint.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the features on this camera. 
Cons:. I have found no con with this phone. 
Summary:. this camera is the best one i've used. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, compact and light, takes fantastic pictures. 
Cons:. The manual is impossible to read. On off switch in a bad spot.. 
Summary:. In the past five years I have had many cameras but this camera takes the most beautiful pictures ever. It has a big screen in the back to review your pictures and ease of use is incredible. One day of pushing all the buttons and taking pictures is all you need and you will be a pro at this camera. I can't rave about it enough.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stylish; Modest; Easy to use; better than any other point and shoot i've owned. 
Cons:. No fancy features, very simplistic. 
Summary:. The lens could use a little speed when coming in and out when turning the camera on and off. (Battery was fully charged, and camera is two weeks old) It isn't terribly slow though so it shouldn't bother anyone too much though. Of course; test it out before you make your purchase. It wins over the SD870 with its viewfinder, and style.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pocketable size, quick startup, excellent images in many situations without flash, excellent screen image in all but very bright sunlight.. 
Cons:. Had to exchange first camera because SD card would not remain inserted after about 2 weeks. Called Canon and was reassured that this is not a common problem.. 
Summary:. I considered many cameras before settling on the 850IS. I wanted a camera that would easily fit in my pocket and take acceptable photos under most conditions and I'm satisfied I made the correct decision. SD850IS feels like a solidly built camera made in Japan....not China.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Picture quality(inside and out), video quality, features. 
Cons:. Lacking a battery meter, bright flash. 
Summary:. I love this camera. The images are excellent quality both inside and outside. It has many features such as iso settings, themes, White Ballance, etc. It also takes images very quickly with is a huge bonus for me taking pics of my little boy. I like its small size and light weight. It appears to be a great quality camera construction wise.. My only real cons are the super bright flash and the lacking battery meter. I can't figure out a way too see how much power is remaining in the battery. If anyone knows of a way please post.. All in all, A beautiful camera well worth the money. I can't see how anyone can be disappointed with this buy. I'm glad I got it. 

$$;
Pros:. quick capture of images, automatic tilt images, quality of pictures. 
Cons:. location of on/off button. A little bulky. 
Summary:. all in all this a great camera. it was given to me as a gift and coming from a person who was so attached to sony, this is by far the best camera I've had. I have had a total of three digital cameras since 2003 and I don't think I'll be changing it anytime except mayber for the sd900 or the canon SLR rebel. It has a really bright flash for some reason so it's hard for me to get nice close-up shots of the kids without their eyes closes. I've only had it for about a week so I still have to figure out how to properly use it. Way cheaper than Sony's 8.1mp camera, you shouldn't be disappointed with this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, takes great pictures, easy to use. 
Cons:. I have nothing negative to say about this camera. 
Summary:. I love this camera, and would highly recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture quality, a variety of options.. 
Cons:. Viewfinder a little awkward to use.. 
Summary:. The Cannon PowerShot SD850 IS has been a huge step up in photo tech for me. The last two cameras have been cheap and the pictures proved it. This camera takes fiarly great pics in poor lighting and superior pics in good lighting. I've only had the camera for about a week now and haven't pushed it to it's limits but it definitely has been worth the price. The option to take either regular photos or video is awesome! You'll need at least a 1GB SD card to really enjoy these two features. I haven't found anything that really bugs me about the camera as of yet other than the viewfinder is a little awkward to use. In the end, this little pocket-sized camera is one I'm very pleased with!. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, great images, easy movie editing, easy to carry, solid feet. 
Cons:. none that I can think of, but nothing's perfect, eh?. 
Summary:. OK, so I have a Nikon D80 that I love, but let's face it, it's not easy to carry around with you on a day to day basis and on business trips. Consequently, I've been looking at the wide range of point-and-shoot cameras out there. I opted for this one over the SD-870 because I do like the viewfinder.. ANY product that I can use right out of the box without even glancing at the manual is fine by me. Any product that allows me to do that and then performs admirably has my heart. As soon as the battery charged I was able to shoot movies and then edit them using the included software, and I still haven't opened the manual.. I cannot wait until I can get this thing out with me on business trips where I see some of my old colleagues, or when I can carry it in my purse and capture all the goings on at work.. VERY happy customer!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, great pictures, easy to use.. 
Cons:. Flash only works so well indoors.. 
Summary:. I love just about everything about this camera. It is quick, easy to use and takes good pictures. It is my third digital camera, and I am not disappointed. The flash is no different than any other camera I have used, just wish all digital cameras could shoot farther/clearer in the dim indoor light. I agree with c-net's opinion that it has everything you would want in a point and shoot.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and great software. Great battery life. 
Cons:. Slippery to handle ....USE wrist strap. 
Summary:. We had a Nikon for about 5 years and put in $100's worth of AA batteries and now with the Lith rechargeable we have yet to charge battery after about 100 shots.. 

$$;
Pros:. Viewfinder w/LCD screen, image clarity, small size, sleek body, fun to use, fun adjustment features. 
Cons:. Yes the elusive power button IS cumbersome to press but not a big deal. 
Summary:. I just got this camera and I like it. I like the way it looks, it's size, decent weight, its various features and ease of use for a digital camera beginner (this is my first one). I think I got what I paid for and am happy with it. All in one neat little stylish package. This camera doesn't come with a carrying case, that's the one gripe I'll make. I LOVE movie mode; audio sound is excellent, and my other favorite feature is red eye correction after photos are taken. The LCD image changes direction when you turn the camera vertically or horizontally. I would like the rechargeable battery to last longer when using the camera (lasts me 1 day of frequent use) but on the bright side the charger is portably sleek (the outlet plug folds flush into the base) and full charge takes only 2 hours.. Updated. on Dec 23, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Many different options and features. 
Cons:. A little confusing at time when not carrying instructions. 
Summary:. My wife and I recently went overseas to visit family. The camera was great. I am so glad I got this model versus the 870. I read in a few different reviews that the viewfinder comes in handy when conditions are sunny. I had this same thing happen to me, but because I had the view finder I was able to take the shot. The video is great. Its as though I have the world's smallest video recorder. The zoom works well and the quality of the picture/sound were quite good when replaying. After purchasing a 4 gig memory card I should be set for a while.. All in all I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend to everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice Formfactor, solid, excellent picture quality. 
Cons:. Somewhat awkward Flash placement and power button. 
Summary:. Overall, I just love this camera. It supports the SD type memory which is all I own so I already had plenty of memory. Although this is my wife's camera, I love taking pictures with it and have almost mothballed my Casio Exilim 7.2 I tried to get her to take mine and let me have this one but that was a no-go.. The picture quality even on enlargement is outstanding...vibrant colors with virtually no distortion. Taking pictures is quite easy with a dial on the right side to switch from manual, auto, video, or review. Don't expect to take a picture every second but it is acceptable for a point &#38; shoot. Battery life is also good. We have charged it up once and it still hasn't hit 1/4 discharge yet....give or take 400 pics w/wo flash. It is a solid camera with a good feel. It fits well in my grip. All the hinges and battery compartments seem solid. I covered the screen with a protector as I do all my electronics with viewscreens. I've blown my photos up to 8x10 with ease.. The only con I could find with this camera that is truly noteable is the location of the flash. It requires some finess on finger position. My wife is constantly blocking the flash with her fingers. I hold my camera differently so it's not an issue but the flash is on the very top left edge of the unit which makes it very easy to block which will cast a shadow on flash photos only. In daylight, she has no issues.. If I could, I would have given this camera a 9.5/10 because nothing with the camera itself is really a major issue.... outstanding picture quality, excellent battery life (with all sounds still enabled). Hope this helps,. -J. 

$$;
Pros:. waiting for delivery. 
Cons:. need better MC?. 
Summary:. the salesperson said I would need a "high speed" memory card for best results. anyone know if that's true?. thanks. 

$$;
Pros:. good picture quality,easy to use. 
Cons:. little manual abilities. 
Summary:. I bought this camera based on cnet reviews and I found out that it's good to listen to what other people say about their experiences!I wanted to buy sony cybershot t100 at first,but after reading everything about reviews and user's opinions I changed my mind and prefered to buy the most popular camera on cnet.(actually it used to be the most popular that time) quality of pictures are fantastic,it has lots of brilliant options like face detection, (Canon's face detection is the best,believe me!)great flash,good button function,superb macro option (for taking pictures from very close options) and a lot more.If it had little more manual options than it has,it would be the best choice ever!and also the price is a little bit high,because you need to buy at least a 1G memory card and I recommend a case and an LCD guard for it.that's all,don't hesitate,buy it! (It is known as "PowerShot SD 850 IS" in US,and as "IXUS 950 IS" in some countries.also ixus ones have smaller viewfinders I think.(comparing to sd850 photos.)but they are the same.). 

$$;
Pros:. Menus are vastly improved over previous version. 
Cons:. Not many. Battery life when shooting video is a little short.. 
Summary:. This is my second canon and I LOVE it. Great features:. - Time lapse video is great for filming events and saving space.. - Panorama feature is really oool.. - Accept 4G sdhd card. Really worth it.. - Video is excellent.. - Photo images are good. Not that much better than my last 6.3Megapixel camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Optical viewfinder, large display, loaded with features, good video, macro setting is near perfect., manual ISO setting, and much more.... 
Cons:. No manual focus, shutter or aperture settings. 
Summary:. I previously owned two Fuji cameras(FinePix 2800 and S607)but got tired of the shutter lag...so 2+ years ago I purchased my Canon Rebel XT and swore I would never own another point-n-shoot digital camera. However, I had business in Colorado in October '07 right when the leaves were changing and my wife needed our SLR. So I purchased the SD-850 IS, dropped it in my shirt pocket, and caught my flight to CO. One day into my 4 day trip my 1GB SD card was full and I had to download my pics to my laptop (I had to repeat this several times).. This camera was awesome...it took great photos...even while (safely) driving down the road...probably due to the IS function. I love to take macro shoots...and this camera did not disappoint. At dinner one night I found myself rearranging the table candle and rose in order to get some coool special effects pics.. I now carry this camera all the time...not as a replacement to my Rebel XT, but just because it's fun to shoot...loaded with features..and NOT near as heavy as my SLR.. My professional photographer friends are amazed and the quality (pics under ISO 200)...and two have already gone out and purchased the SD-850. GET IT...YOU'LL LOVE IT....and the price is right!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, Time Lapse Movie, Clear LCD screen. 
Cons:. No 28 mm Wide Angle. 
Summary:. The 800 has a wider angle lens. The 850 has an interesting time lapse movie movie mode and higher pixel count LCD.. After investigating these two cameras I decided to go with the 850 with its higher pixel LCD screen (230,000 vs 207,000). Not included in the CNET review (or on Canon's website) is the neat Time Lapse Movie mode. It will take a still either every 1 or 2 seconds and then put them together into a movie. It will record this movie for up to two hours. I haven't tested that the battery will last that long though. This is a nice feature.. I think people will need to weigh the wide angle of the 800 versus this time lapse mode, LCD screen and some of the other features (better face recognition ?) mentioned by other reviewers. I haven't found the power button location to be a problem.. After finding the Time Lapse I am happy with my decision. I will save the wide angle for my digital SLR purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Takes great pictures in different exposure settings. Easy to switch from manual to automatic. Menu easy to use. Really user friendly.. 
Cons:. Kinda small for my big hands.. 
Summary:. I really like the picture quality and the easy of use. Best of the 5 digital cameras I've had.. 

$$;
Pros:. slick and easy to pick up and use for a fairly experienced first timer. Simple enough options, if you say you can't figure them out then why even attempt to try? you'll be FINE!. 
Cons:. could use a stronger optical zoom.. but thats about all I feel I need to complain about.. 
Summary:. I haven't owned a digital camera for a while so, needless to say I'd been searching for something fast, compact, sleek, and sophisticated without cutting corners. This camera does the trick if you want just what you need for really great point and snap photo and video.. 

$$;
Pros:. face identification, Image Stabilization and sleek design.. 
Cons:. Makes me wonder why I carry my Canon Rebel XT too!. 
Summary:. I love the camera, it is so handy, because of its size, sliding in the shirt pocket with ease. The bottom line in any camera is ease of use and the guality of the photos. This camera excels and will exceed your expectations! I would recommend this to any level protographer!. It is a very sophisticated instrument.. 

$$;
Pros:. Superior IS as compared to other similar brands.. 
Cons:. not at the moment... 
Summary:. This is an amazing Camera... The IS of Canon is simply fantastic on this cam as compared to other similar brands ! .. I got this with a 70% discount at http://tinyurl.com/32yfoy. ==&gt; Just enter this Coupon code : VR4X188HB0DJL3. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy of use, fast start up, Image Stabilization, photo quality, great camera for the casual tourist. Very small &#38; light battery charger.. 
Cons:. You may want to pick up a second battery pack, but they are affordable. Image Stabilization is not a "cure all", it shouldn't be so don't expect it to be, it is a BIG help though.. 
Summary:. I don't know why the On/Off button was presented as a problem. It is in a decent location, easy to find and use, AND since you 99% of the time have your fingers on the top of the camera you DO NOT have to worry about accidentally turning the camera off &#38; on. Where it is makes sense, I have big fingers and it is not an issue. Make sure you buy protective film for the display and a decent carrying case. I bought a USA GEAR slim pocket carry case from Amazon and I'm very happy with how easy the case and camera drop into your front pants pocket or cargo pants pockets no worries.. 

$$;
Pros:. well built, great pic quality, streamlined design, 4x zoom. 
Cons:. no case included. 
Summary:. After researching long and hard, I finally decided on the Canon SD850 IS (or the IXUS 950 IS as it is known here in Europe?!?!). I upgraded from a 5.1 megapixal Sony which took decent shots for a couple of years, but functions starting to really deteriorate in the last six months.. I really believe that companies which make one main product (not one that manufactures radios to lawnmowers) tend to make a superior product.. If you are looking for a top-end point and shoot that produces absolutely beautiful pictures with little effort, pick up this Canon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, clarity, performance, price and construction.. 
Cons:. Power-On/Power Off Button. 
Summary:. This is Canon doing what it does best. I am a avid Canon fan first and foremost. I've tried the Sony and Nikon digital cameras as well but both nver even came close to what Canon can accomplish in digital composition.. I also own a Canon 30D SLR and a Canon S5. Current 2007 models that perform very well (especially the 30D). I use my Canon 30D to compare everything to (using a USM IS lens).. I took Canon's SD850IS out against my other two Canon's and once back from the shoot and photos onto Adobe, the SD850IS was the winner hands-down in the simple auto mode. Just stunning color and clarity and the IS (image stablization) was so accurate; even when I tried to force a smear from moving the camera by hand as fast as I could.. I am anything but a professional or even a intermediate user/photographer. I travel a great deal and I have the cameras always going even if I've shot the areas many times before.. Canon's SD850IS digital camera wins my affection.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use,compact. 
Cons:. red eye effect,sometimes blur pic. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality and image stabilizer top notch for a point and shoot. 
Cons:. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for.. 
Summary:. Although the 850 is a little expensive, I can't complain. I recently (unfortunately) broke my 800IS when coffee was spilled on it at a wedding. Not missing a beat, I took the opportunity to purchase the upgraded 850. I love it, and since the costly mistake I am much more careful. I have had 4 digital cameras over 7 years. Between Sony, Nikon, and now Cannon, no doubt Cannon knows what it takes to make a great camera. If only it was liquid proof.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image stabilizer, compact, great setting for video. 
Cons:. The on/off buttom in a wierd space. 
Summary:. I have had this camera for about a week and so far it take really good pictures. I am coming from an olympus styles verve. The on/off button is in a wierd place but other then that I have had alot of fun figuring out the different settings. The battery life is good. The LCD has nice color and is big enough for you to show friends and family momber the shot you just took. It takes amazing video it is not grainy and it is clear.. I have good pictures in low light and in normal light also. It also has a view finder which I dont really use. Over all it has been a great camera so far and i have an underwater housing on the way. I will let you know how that works out..

Summary:. It's not always about the camera, it's about who is handling it and how to use it.. The IXUS 950 IS (known also as Powershot SD850) is quite a good compact camera. Great colors, ISO levels are the best in this range of cameras, battery life could be an handicap if you keep on using the Auto flash and reviewing the images and videos, otherwise its standard.. 

$$;
Pros:. user friendly excellent picture quality. 
Cons:. on off button could be a little larger. 
Summary:. clear picture plenty of options to choose from no regret on purchase. Have a canon camcorder use to use for pictures also-pictures look great on my 50 inch plasma linked through my xbox 360 and computer.

Pros:. Very good camera, Good quality photos, Fast.. 
Cons:. Rather small screen but good enough.. 
Summary:. I had recently bought a Sony Cybershot T20 thinking it would be a pretty good camera. It turned out so-so, the photos were inconsistant and the face detection sometimes worked. So I spent a lot of time looking for a camera, it was difficult because the reviews written by the people were very inconsistant one would give it a 9 the other a 4 so it was pretty hard. I found out that the only person you can trust is yourself so I went and bought the Sony T100 and the Canon 850 IS because those were the two top cameras that Best Buy had at the moment. My friend lent me his SD800 and the SD750 and I had previously bought the Sony T20. Honestly they all gave good results as in if i compared the best photos each camera shot they were all at par. I personally discarted the SD 800 and the 750 because they are only 7 megapixels very good cameras but I wanted one with 8. As I mentioned before the Sony T20 was very inconsistant, so that was also discarded. The Sony T100 is probably the coolest camera I've seen, it has a really nice screen and it is very thin. Although the menu system was only O.K. it did its function. The optical zoom was very nice, helping in a lot of situations. As I started taking photos I realized that the problem of the Sony T20 was present here. In AUTO mode the pictures didn't come out that good. I mean some came out really good but in certain light conditions. I then tested the Canon SD850 and after 20 photos or so knew that I was going to keep the camera. It was hard to decide seeing that the looks ont the Sony T100 are much better than the Canon SD850 (at least in my opinion) but at the end the most important thing is the quality of the picture and the consistancy of the quality in the photo that is why I stayed with the Canon, which I really recomend.. I hope that helps you, but everyone thinks different. My personal advice is just to test them both either in the store or where ever you get a chance, because you are the one that is buying the camera.. Sean. P.S. I think that the score should have been 8.2 for the Canon SD850 IS and 8.0 for the Sony T100.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's made by Canon and the re-load to set up the next shot is wonderful.. 
Cons:. For the price they should include a case otherwise I haven't found anything that is in question.. 
Summary:. The fact that this camera does things my other camera couldn't do is such a plus. The effects, the clarity and the ease of use has made this a great camera. The back on/off is in a great place. In bright sunlight this camera was easy to see. The effects! I still haven't been able to use some of them yet. Can not wait to use the Xmas lights at night option.. Keep ya posted if I find something wrong.. Updated. on Oct 23, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to operate,great pics. 
Cons:. USB cover flimsy. 
Summary:. I dont know why the criticism over the on/off button,i think is placed perfectly to avoid accidental pressing.This camera is very easy to operate.My only gripe is the cover for the usb cable.It is held very flimsily by a small piece of rubber,so I bought a small Sony card reader and I plug THAT in my pc and download from the SD card.The picture quality is great&gt;I am still playing with it and learning more,but as I learn more about it,I like it even more.. 

$$;
Pros:. digic 3 ,4x zoom , sdhc compatibility , 8mp ,image stabolization, high res screan very fast. 
Cons:. its a bit bigger then other ELPH's, screan still gets anti glare coat scratched, deleting images is a bit slow. 
Summary:. first off if you have never had an IS camera before and dont really believe that stuff like that works then think again because it does ONLY WITH CANON all the other crapy cameras that sony makes that say they stabolize the image are liers because there is no effect with those anyways the camera i had before was a canon sd600 and i was considering upgrading to the sd1000 but i read reveiws all over the net and discovered that the sd600 was actually BETTER then the newer sd1000 and actually has a better built lens that goes closer with macros ( not as close as the canon sd850is can go but close to that )anyways this is the camera i would recommend to anyone its got enough resolution 8mp and the image stabolization is the best its a absolutly ground breaking feature that will change your entire prospective on how taking pictures works with the IS you dont even have to wait to or even try to hold the camera steady ive had times where i actually tryed to make the image blurry and was unsuccesful thats how useful it is also the new canon digic 3 prosessor is also another key to this bad boy the new prosessor is smarter and more responsive somtimes when im taking a shot i push the shutterdown accidentally befor it has the chance to prefocus the shot and ive still gotten a fantastic picture but the IS dose fail to work somtimes but truthfully any camera that promises somthing liek that is usually too good to be true i cant wait for canons digic 4 processor then this camera would probably have gotten a 10 also it would be nice if a camera that i payed more then 400$ for would have a screan that was actually SCRATCH PROOF as in NO SCRATCHES WHAT SO EVER !!!! stupid anti glare coating on my sd600 is all screwed up and so help me god if that happends to this one im going back to best but to ***** at them cuz i consider that really really really annoying also if you get this camera take advantage of the SDHC reader to get a 4gb SDHC card if you go to amazone they sell um real cheap there and its a wonderful investment : ). GET THIS CAMERA you wont regret it its light years ahead of the previous models !. go canon!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great pictures!. 
Cons:. Too much red eye. 
Summary:. Just got the SD850 to replace my Fuji camera and I just love it. The pictures have come out great whether they are indoors or outdoors except for few long distance people pictures that came out blury. The face recognition feature works great until you get over 30 feet away, then it start having some problems. Also, there has been a little too much red eye for my taste, but that can easily overcome with the software provided. Other than that all the features work great including the Canon software for downloading and saving pictures. I would highly recommend this camera to everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great design, quick, Excellent picture/ video quality, Many nifty options, great focusing, Well worth the money,Image stabilization, Face detection,Optical view finder, large screen.. 
Cons:. Price a bit hefty, No manual exposure controls but there are some,. 
Summary:. Great camera, I was debating for awhile if I really needed to spend $400 on a point and shoot camera but I went to Circut City and found it for $349 so I took the price and price matched it at another store with a better return policy. I'm very happy with the camera's quality and functions. I would definitly recomend this camera to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, quality, features, 4X zoom, 8mg etc. 
Cons:. 32mg card is too small. 
Summary:. I was at a trade show in San Diego, and needed a camera for our booth photos. I bought this at Ritz for $399, and found it an excellent investment. I also bought three 1mg memory cards on special sale for $38 total, and filled 2 out of 3 of the cards at the event. The camera takes wonderful pictures, so much so I may carry this more often that my Canon EOS 20D (a convenience factor). The camera is very intuitive, and easy to get started with. I agree with the other user's opinion that the CNET reviewer made a mistake on the power button - my take is that it was designed so that it cannot be turned on by mistake while in your pocket.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. can't think of any. 
Summary:. Just one comment, CNET, please stop picking on the on/off button. This is meant, I think, to be a thumb switch, and as such, is VERY easy to find and work. I hope Canon does not take your advice and change it.. Thanks for being a great resourse.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super Fast camera.great quality images as always from canon. hi res screen for viewing images in all lighting. 4x optical zoom. Image stabilization, very durable case, nothing feels cheap or flimsy.. 
Cons:. Im not a fan of the viewfinder but it can come in handy. controls were akward at first. no case or dock included. nothing major to gripe about with this camera.. 
Summary:. I want to start out by saying I'm a lover off all canon digital cameras, this is my second one (SD630). I prefer the warmth in the images canon cameras produce vs. any other company out there.. This camera is a nice upgrade to the SD700 (not the 800 like many people think).. It is very fast, one thing i hated about switching to digital was the lag in when i start to take the image and when it actually happens. I find canon to very fast both the 850 and my previous 800. I used this camera at friends birthday party with little kids running around, i was able to pull out my 850, turn it on and get great shots in no time, which is a major plus!. I love the chargers that come with canon digital cameras, it is very convent.The battery door is very solid on this camera as well as the whole case in general.. The screen works well in all lighting conditions and they updated it to be scratch resistant which is nice since people always put there hand all over it.. Canons DIGIC III processor is awesome, i can see a difference in the image quality vs. my sd630, canon outdid themselves with this, I feel it will be a while before i look for an upgrade.. One thing I'm not crazy about is the controls, but you do get used to it. i like on my sd630 how it was all pretty much run with the wheel and the two buttons on the bottom (menu and display) with the 850 they have a wheel on the side which since using the SD630 seems pretty odd and not needed. To be honest i think it is more designed for older users or professional users, the SD630 was pretty flashy with the 3" screen.. The side wheel is not a deal breaker and it is the same look and feel of all the SDs with a viewfinder. I just feel like if I'm swithcing around it's more convenient to have it all in one location. The viewfinder is also something i feel is more pro, older user, traditional feature. It is kind of a drying feature on many cameras and most people applaud canon for keeping it. It does not bother me, the screen is still plenty big for me, maybe i will give the viewfinder a try and see how i like it.. The screen is dead on in color accuracy, better than some DIGI slrs i have seen, i did some tests in comparison shots with a friends, what you see on the screen is true to the colors you just shot and looks the same on my computer screen.. The face detection is kind of new to me, i have tested it and it works great but i think companies are just tyring to advertise these gimmick features to keep pace.. The image stabilization is no gimmick and works great, since my last camera did not have i can see the difference right out of the box.. It is not the most super thin and light camera but it fits great in any pocket or purse and to be honest it has a little weight to it which makes it feel sturdy and well made.. The camera does not come with many of the things other cameras do like a dock or case ( i miss the leather case many canons used to come with, it was a nice accessory) But you have wonder why some of the cameras that cost the same with all the cases and docks, i guess i prefer i pay for the camera and its features vs. a dock and case.. Overall this is a great camera, fast and takes excellent images! I recommend it to all ages and user level, you will not be disappointed!. 

$$;
Pros:. None over the SD800 IS. 
Cons:. None except higher price and narrower wide angle. 
Summary:. I don't understand the reason for this camera...go to Canon's site and compare the specs with it's predessor...they are worse in most categories...not by much but the only feature I saw was .2 more tele, a fraction faster and slow motion. Otherwise it has narrower wide angle, uses more power, and costs more. Right now most retailers are discounting this model since a new one is out. Higher model numbers do not mean improvement...look at the SD1000...more pixels but at a price and now it sells for less than the 800!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, reliable, slim. Excellent design and very good photo quality.. 
Cons:. CCD could be a bit larger, Hi-res video would also be appropriate. And a bit pricey, too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good photos, great color, docs with universal mini-USB cable, takes cheap SD/MMC cards, good battery life, very compact, feels solid, very fast startup &#38; btw photos. 
Cons:. Blurry photos at fairly low ISO - lots of noise even at 200!!. 
Summary:. I almost returned this camera after trying it out for a week. All my photos were terribly noisy. Don't know if it's a defect of my camera or what, but even at ISO 200 (what the Auto setting usually uses) the pics are pretty bad. HOWEVER, when I used Manual to set the ISO to 80 or 100 the pics came out beautifully (which seemed to work even in fairly low light, for some reason). The proof is in the pudding - the photos from my trip to Peru were fantastic - much better than the ones my Sony Cybershot W80 took in Costa Rica. (And arguably, the Sony had prettier material to work with...). The IS seems to work pretty well, also, since I hardly had any blurry shots to delete.. II also love that I can travel with just a 6-inch mini-usb cable that works with all of my electronics, instead of that big clunky cable Sony burdened me with.. 

$$;
Pros:. takes very clear high quality pics. I love the point and shoot predefined settings.. 
Cons:. the only con that I can come up with is that the battery chamber cover does not have a lock on it. if you are not careful, you will open the battery chamber by accident which turns off the camera.. 
Summary:. I would purchase this camera again. it is just a bit thicker than my previous camera, the SD 750 but the quality is much better than the 750 and the extra features make it great. Very friendly camera. 

$$;
Pros:. test test test. 
Cons:. test test test. 
Summary:. Updated. on Aug 15, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. great picture quality, long battery life, small, many advanced features. 
Cons:. It takes long time to learn all the features. Owners' manual not user friendly.. 

$$;
Pros:. same features as previous IXUS models, Image stabilization, face detection. 
Cons:. More megapixels, but picture quality suffers a bit. 
Summary:. I bought this after a friend dropped and broke my SD700IS. That camera replaced by S500, thus I have some experience with this line. In terms of features this camera is nearly identical to the SD700 but with a higher megapixel count for the sensor. Unfortunately, I think increasing the number of megapixels also has resulted in poorer low-light image quality than the previous model. Don't get me wrong, this is still an excellent camera that delivers punchy photos and outpaces nearly all other small point and shoot cameras (except perhaps older Fujifilm F-series for low-light shooting); however more megapixels with the same features does not equal a better camera. Numerous articles have been written about the problems with small lenses and large megapixels.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great product takes excellent pictures. 
Cons:. I have found no cons. 
Summary:. This is a great product. It takes great pictures. I am happy with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Moderate price, pocket size, good picture resolution, long battery life. 
Cons:. As descirbed by Cnet, dial wheel camera mode selector. 
Summary:. This camera I selected due to Cnet reviews that surpassed those on Amazon for useable information.. Outdoor daylight photography in dusty conditions for commercial purposes this camera has made me money. The battery has never died during a job. The easy to travel with battery charger and use of a battery supplied with the camera that can be charged without being fully dis-charged is a big plus for insureing I can take 100's of pictures on my typiclaly 3-5 day outdoor, 10-14 hour day work trips. This camera is not coddled. I have used it for more than a year and carry it in my field/work pants pockets, thrown it into a brief case, no case, it collects dust and occassional outdoor dampness and the picture quality is well suited for my visiual presentations to muliple viewers.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good color, limited controls, very portable,. 
Cons:. Limited flash power, view finder a little too small.. 
Summary:. My 3rd point &#38; shoot from Canon, from a 3MP Sureshot to the 5MP S500 and now an 8MP with IS. And the IS works! Not too shabby. There's not a whole lot to complain about for it's intended purpose. Just enough modes and controls to be creative. Very portable. I carry this camera every day all day at work. Almost all the Auto Mode images come out well enough to print or email without post-processing.. Low light (including some fluorescent lighting) situations will require switching to Manual mode to adjust the exposure compensation or white balance. Or just purchase a Metz 28 CS-2 Digital Slave flash.. Ok, the view finder isn't the best, it could be larger but it works when I need it. So I get a little larger screen for a little less viewfinder. With my 53 year old far-sighted eyes it's not a bad trade off. I found it also saves a little battery juice when I'm out in direct sunlight. I leave the screen off and just use the view finder to compose. I always leave a little extra space around my images for post-processing anyways.. Forget what the naysayers and nitpickers have to say about this camera. Hey! It's a simple digital point &#38; shoot camera after all. It's not intended to give DSLR results. But with any camera or lens I recommend going to your local store and ask to handle and look closely at the item befor buying. It's a very good little camera that takes very good images..

$$;
Pros:. Faster then the Canon SD870. 
Cons:. Missed some small kids indoors action shots. 
Summary:. I was looking for a fast, low light, small simple P&#38;S camera, whose prints will usually be normal size(4x6,5x7). The Fujifilm Finepix F40fd (F45fd) is the fastest low light P&#38;S camera I can buy at this time (Nov 20,2007). Before I review, let me say a THANK YOU, to all who do post their reviews, because I have read them ALL, and a really big THANK YOU to the CNET staff, who give the LOW contrast shutter speed in their reviews. Since October I have been researching to find the fastest (for fast moving small kids) low light (for evening indoor pictures) P&#38;S camera. I also know 99.9% of my prints will be 4x6 or 5x7, never bigger. And I want the red-eye reduction to work! I refuse to do touch-ups.. I have visited all local stores (BestBuy, CircuitCity, Target, Sears, Frys, Wolf, Office Depot &#38; Max, Staples) multi-times to play with all cameras. Yes, I am retired and have the time. Plus I reviewed all CNET P&#38;S reviews from 1/25/07 to 11/15/07. I documented speeds of low contrast shutter and shot 2 shot with flash. From my research, the final candidates, based on low light speeds, were Fuji F40fd, Canon SD 800, 850, 870(*).. * Interesting the Canon SD870 specs say it should be as fast as the 850, but comparing 850 vs 870 under store lights, at 2 different BB stores, the 850s were noticeable faster. I even had the salesperson swap the batteries, between the two, just to be sure.. I purchased the Fuji F45fd and Canon SD850. I borrowed a CanonSD800 and had my Canon A610. Without question the Fuji was the fastest for evening indoors pictures. The Fuji was also the fastest for flash recharge. The Canons 800 &#38; 850 did missed some small kids indoors action shots. All cameras had the same brand 2Gb 150x SD. After a week I printed all the shots, as 4x6s, from the same store, as different orders with different names, to ensure no pictures were mixed.. The Canon SD800 had too many red-eyes. My old A610 was to slow for evening indoor shots. For outdoor daylight shots, all 4 cameras had the same speed results.. Overall the 4x6s quality was the same between the Fuji F45 &#38; Canon SD850. Comparing two very similar pictures, sometimes one would be a slight plus over the other, when you looked close up, then on another picture the other camera would be a slight better, but no real difference.. The Canons do have a better long range zoom, at MAX zoom. If your need is for enlarge crops, the Canon AUTO pictures are taken at lower ISO, then the Fuji, see comparison below. I also tested the Canon SD850 with different ISOs in low light conditions. It was at the manual ISO 1600, that the Canon was as fast as the Fuji AUTO(ISO800), but the Canon(1600) pictures had higher noise.. Here are the ISO results, taken with AUTO mode. I believe this to be very important to understand the results. The listed numbers will first be Fuji F40(F45) then Canon SD850.. AUTO mode:. Evening indoors F@800, C@200. Outdoors 10pm Christmas Lights F@800, C@250. Outdoors bright sun, at min zoom F@100, C@80. Outdoors bright sun, at max zoom F@100, C@160. Outdoors cloudy F@200, C@80. Conclusion:. NO one camera is perfect for all people or all conditions!!!!!. Fuji F40/F45 is for those who want a fast, low light, small simple P&#38;S camera, whose prints will usually be normal size(4x6,5x7). It is the BEST P&#38;S available today, to capture fast moving kids indoors. I also appreciate the battery indicator.. Canon SD850 is a great P&#38;S choice for more outdoors(vs indoors) or indoor adults (vs kids) pictures, or if you usually print pictures bigger then normal size.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, ease of use, wide angle lens.. 
Cons:. None, have nothing to compare it to.. 

$$;
Pros:. Rechargable battery, easy to use, quick refresh.. 
Cons:. Flash is automatically on when you power up camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Many custom features, image stabilization works well. 
Cons:. on/off button is in a lousy spot and awkward. 
Summary:. It takes very good night time pictures including fireworks. Manual features like changing exposure time is convenient to change if needed. In addition, it has numerous auto modes that work well too. With all that said, I have one question: Why won't my mac recognize my camera when I plug it into the usb port???? Guess I'll have to search the support boards.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image Stabilizer a definite plus.. 
Cons:. Higher price, expensive battery.. 
Summary:. Many a times, in the excitement of shooting or in wanting to get a sudden cute pose or a sudden shot, and keeping my eyes on the subject, I pressed the on-off switch instead!! And as the whole camera shuts down the sudden, unitentional, cute pose is gone forever. So this switch at the back, can never be pressed accidentally when you press the shutter. It's great and I just cannot figure out why so many digital cameras have the switch close to the shutter button.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image stabilization and pictures at dusk. 
Cons:. On/ off button small. 
Summary:. I love this camera and it's 4 power zoom with image stabilizer. Excellent pictures so far. Expensive but I feel it is worth it. I also love the battery duration and easy charging. Quite a step up from my Cannon SD 400!. 

$$;
Pros:. true image with all functions from previous model, 4X optical zoom. 
Cons:. Broadway Photo misadvertised the product for money. 
Summary:. We bought it at BROADWAY PHOTO, it is www.bwayphoto.com. They advertised as Brand New come with 1-year manufacture warranty. We received not a SD850, but a SD810 (comparable camera). The SD180 is not intended to sell in USA, and therefore no Warranty paper from manufacture. Manual received in the box also not original, but a copy from SD850. Later on, we figured that there is no "Image stablizer" found in camera. In conclusion, don't buy from BROADWAY PHOTO or other not certified stores.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent snaps, sleekness,battery life. 
Cons:. no zoom while vdo recording as sx 100 :-(. 
Summary:. first excellent snap qality, touch wheel for scrolling the snaps , auto rotate makes life easy for rotating the snaps rather.. But the main &#38; biggest wired part is , cannt zoom while vdo recording. It will keep the zoom level , on which you started the vdo recording. You cannt zoom or even unzoom while recordin.. Also compared to its descenders , shooting modes are less in this model.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice lcd, small. 
Cons:. Weak flash, images not sharp, bad button/dial layout. 
Summary:. After being disappointed by the SD750 image quality, I purchased the SD850 IS, hoping the IS part would help. Not so much. I took the SD850 IS and my old Sony all over the house and backyard all day in different lighting situations. The Sony outperformed the Canon in terms of sharpness and lighting indoors. The Canon outperformed the old Sony in terms of color balance. But I'd rather have a sharp clear photo with the color slightly off than a blurry photo with true color.. The indoor shots from the SD850 IS were pretty bad. The flash was way too weak. The top half of the photos are too dark. There was also not a way to force the flash on (only options are Auto or Off). If you take a photo with the flash indoors, it is too dark in parts of the photo. If you open the windows and let in lots of ambient light and take it with the flash off - the photo looks great color-wise, but it is blurry. I wasn't satisfied with either option.. Outside, the photos were better - but I was still getting some blur. In addition, in the bright sun - the background was way overexposed.. Also, my thumb kept accidentally hitting hte dial and popping up a menu. Very annoying.. Another annoying thing - when you plug the camera into the computer, you have to have it in playback mode to download the photos.. It took OK photos. But I'm looking for something that takes great photos. I also did not like the button layout at all. I took the camera back and the search continues.... 

$$;
Pros:. Other than lens problem, pics are great, controls are pretty intuitive, lightweight.. 
Cons:. I have had 2 Powershot cameras. first one had lens problem - but after 2+ years with frequent use. 2nd one seems to be fine (don't want to jinx myself). This 3rd one was the worst.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love all the features. 
Cons:. Fuzzy pictures most of the time. 
Summary:. This SD 850 IS replaced my SD 650 (very little water ruined that camera). I LOVED the SD 650, but figured I'd upgrade to the SD850. It has all the features I like, but for some reason, most of my pictures come out fuzzy, so I am quite disappointed with the SD 850 IS. 

$$;
Pros:. Colors are true to life in bright light conditions. 
Cons:. Thumbwheel control is clumsy and will set to wrong setting when in hurry.. 
Summary:. I was looking for replacing my old Olympus D540 Digital camera. The only problem with the old one was that it just ate up batteries in less than 15 to 16 snaps. With or without a flash!! The review for SD 850 IS were 8.3 (around Feb 2008), and it also had the rechargable battery. However, on buying the 850 IS - I found that the picture clarity was poor when compared to my Old Olympus (which is a 3.3 MP). Especially poor when using higher ISO settings. The features in 850 IS are plenty - but none gives a non-grainy picture. But I saw that the colors are true-to-life in bright conditions and even in low light conditions. The flash works well!. 

$$;
Pros:. IS, battery life. 
Cons:. No Remote Capture. 
Summary:. you might as well transfer all the images to your computer with a Card Reader, there is nothing that you get by connecting it to your computer,. the Remote Capturing button is disabled and I was told by canon support that this model doesn't support it remote capturing from the computer just like their very older models.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features, easy to use, nice styling, and size. 
Cons:. Image quality, manual could be more detailed. 
Summary:. If you desire clear crisp photos this camera may not be for you. Research stated that this was one of the best in the class and had all the features I was looking for, but in the end it just did not take sharp crisp photos and I had to return it. I am not an expert in taking photos but I made a valiant effort in reading the manual multiple times and taking many photos and tweaking settings trying to get a consistent clear photo for each common situation. It is possible I got a defective camera, however as seen in other posts that this seems to be a common complaint. My previous camera (which has many things I don't like about it), a Kodak EasyShare Z7590, takes great sharp vivid photos as long as you have it focused correctly. If I didnt have better results with a previous camera I might have really liked this one. The reason I tried the camera was to have a seemingly high quality camera full of features in a compact version that would fit in my pocket as well as having a processor that would allow faster photo taking. My primary use for the camera is to take many photos of our child. Because of the nature of the photo taking use, it is not desirable to have to change the settings continuously to hopefully get a great clear non-grainy shot. In conclusion I liked all the features, styling, size, and features of the camera but in the end the most important thing to us was the printed/projected photo that just didnt turn out well(maybe 1 in 10)..

Teach you writers the "KISS" principle.....have them write to the 6th grade level so most of us can understand them...... Also...never never never have an engineer write a manual.

Pros:. Size is great, easy to carry, very lightweight. 
Cons:. Photos are really not that crisp. Prior to this camera I had a Minolta Dimage and the Canon photos don't compare. Both cameras are point and shoot but I have been very disappointed with the Canon photos despite the great reviews everywhere.. 
Summary:. I've had this camera for a year and am already looking for a new one. I'm not a professional photographer by any means but am consistently disappointed in the photo quality as well as usability of this camera. I find the options a bit overwhelming and difficult to maneuver. I have small hands and still have to use my fingernail to push the menu wheel or else I end up with a feature other than the one I was looking for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Can cange the zoom during video. Good batery life.. 
Cons:. Poor quality. The automatic mode is very poor. Need to configure a manual mode to take a good picuture. Don't have to use the camera like pen-drive. Can't load the video taked to the camera to edit. etc. 
Summary:. Not recomended. 

$$;
Pros:. Great pictures. 
Cons:. bad quality. 
Summary:. This is my 3rd Cannon powershot over the years and have been very happy with picture quality on every one, but... Cannon still has obviusly not solved the lens retracting error. Our 520 kept erroring and now this one does too. It's only 7 months old! I think I am officially going to move on from Cannon cameras. Any recomendations? Sony?. 

$$;
Pros:. Decent video quality, Great LCD screen. 
Cons:. Horrible image quality in almost all conditions. 
Summary:. Purchased this based on CNET positive reviews and could not be more disappointed. If you are looking for a good family camera, this is simply not what you are looking for.. Image quality is average at best unless you fiddle with the controls, which really defeats the purpose of a point and shoot.. Nearly every indoor pic causes red eye even in good light during the middle of the day. Some of these are easily fixable but many are not. The Red Eye Correction device is ineffective unless the subject is looking right at it and is within 5- 7 feet of the camera. I have had many a great moment ruined by this.. Canon support is horrible. They essentially admitted to me that they made a bad product and would do nothing. Sorry I didn't return when I had the time.. Stay away from this product!. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, great features. 
Cons:. Plastic lens body covered by thin metal veneer. 
Summary:. I dropped my camera on the garage floor while the lens was extended and the camera was history. Could not be repaired. The internal parts revealed why. Sturdy looking outside covers thin plastic parts inside.. very disappointed.. I won't buy another Canon Elph.. mdv. 

$$;
Pros:. pictures look good. video is great including zoom while recording.. 
Cons:. it broke, just like the previous person said - the lens stopped working.. 
Summary:. Updated. on Sep 20, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Avoid Broadway Photo.. 
Cons:. Broadway Photo is not trustworthy. BE CAREFUL. To be safe, stay away! They won't allow returns: I was told it was too late to return item when I called back 5 minutes later. Also was told, even if I could cancel order, it would cost 15% plus shipping. 
Summary:. Avoid Broadway Photo: my experience was terrible. They don't adhere to the truth.. Updated. on Mar 30, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. It worked well for a while but about 9 months after purchase it stopped working. Best disposable camera ever!. 
Cons:. I seem to have gotten the same run around as some other reviewers, "Warranty repair cannot be honored as the malfunction is due to water damage".. 
Summary:. This camera was not directly exposed to water in any way shape or form. Upon return of the camera I cracked the case open myself to see the alleged water damage, I cannot see the massive corrosion they allege.. This whole thing seems like a cop out to me, perhaps due to a bad design. Maybe this machine is vulnerable to condensation, but if the warranty was worth a hill of beans problems due to a bad design would be covered with apologies.. I will attempt to work with Canon more on this but I get the impression I will be scoping out this site soon for new camera brands.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to Use. 
Cons:. $300 disposable camera. 
Summary:. How many of us Canon "Water Damage" victims are there, I wonder?. Like another reviewer, I purchased the Canon SD850 IS several months ago and have used it regularly. It suddenly stopped working - the lens would not retract. I sent it to Canon for service under their one year warranty. They decided that it would not be "economically feasible" (exact words) to repair the camera and have sent it back to me still broken. Canon "customer care" says that the technicians found "water damage" even though the camera was never around water and worked fine up until the moment it stopped. They even suggested I might have spilled something into it (no way) or perhaps the water damage was caused by going from an air-conditioned environment into a warm humid environment. Ridiculous! Don't most people vacation in warm places? If a camera stops working because it is in warm and humid environment, the label on the camera should clearly state - stay away from nice places!. So it seems that if Canon decides they don't want to repair a camera under warranty, they can just claim "water damage" and they are off the hook. No recourse for the customer, no appeal process.. If you are looking for a $300.00 disposable camera, this is it!. 

$$;
Pros:. small, easy to use. 
Cons:. dead in six months. 
Summary:. I purchased the Canon SD850 IS 6 months ago and have used it regularly. It suddenly stopped working - the lens would not retract. I sent it to Canon for service under their one year warranty. They decided that it would not be "economically feasible" to repair the camera and have sent it back to me still broken. Canon "customer care" says that the technicians found "water damage" even though the camera was never around water and worked fine up until the moment it stopped. Clearly, if they don't want to repair something a customer sends back, they can just say "water damage" and they are off the hook. No recourse for me, no appeal process, nothing for me to do but warn others. It was a nice little camera, but if it is only going to last 6 months, forget about it..
