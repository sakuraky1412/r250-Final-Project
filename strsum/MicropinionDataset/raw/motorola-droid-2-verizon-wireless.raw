Pros:. super fast, very responsive voice dial works awsum, Games play quick no lag time. 
Cons:. no N wireless network. No biggie it's only 3G when 4 G is right around the corrner but I had to get out of my other phone. On con if the lite on the screen goes out you have to push the power button not a deal breaker but it's a little annoying.. 
Summary:. Well I'm broke the economy is bad but I got myself a Droid 2 tonight. I had the LG ally that was my first Droid type. At first I was happy with it but then it got very slow, voice dial didn't work good, the games were slow so I just had to get rid of it. I got myself a Droid 2 and WOW !!!!!!!!!. I can actually voice dictate to facebook, voice dial from the car Somthing that didn't work very well on my old phone. I can view CNN videos now again on my old phone I couldn't do that. I'[m doing better in pac man even though I'm natually a spaz. Connect 4 froze up on the old phone it plays super fast on this one. People complain about the reception I think it's fine. Yes I paid $300.00 retail from craigs list for a brand new one. But it was well worth it. There are more popular phones out there such as the droid X the Samsung Facinate they are also awsum but this spaz with fat fingers needs the keyboard. True the lg had a better keyboard but this one is cool and it has swipe and the feature where it guesses the word while you type so this is much better for me. Sound is great. I would highly recomend this phone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features, lots of apps, nice keyboard, fantastic service and call quality. 
Cons:. Camera isn't great but anyone taking even slightly serious photos shouldn't be using their phone in the first place. The pictures are fine in good light but get grainy in low light situations. Video camera is good though.. 
Summary:. Not sure what the reviews complaining about the battery are all about. Mine lasts days. I am running task killer and the only thing I can think of is that these people aren't properly shutting down programs. Either way I am really satisfied with the battery life. I initially wanted to get the Droid X but my Verizon store didn't have any in stock. I figured I would give the 2 a try and then order an X when they were in stock. There is no way I am giving it back now! I didn't think I would want a physical keyboard but there is just something nice about being able to type. Also this is a really easy keyboard to use.. As far as some other reviews about signal strength and call quality, I have never owned a phone that so markedly increased my signal and quality. The first call I made was to my wife and she was confused where I was calling her from because I sounded so clear. My office is in a complete cell phone dead zone and I am actually getting service there. I am the only person in my office to get a signal.. Bottom line: this is a great phone. Buy it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and very powerful. I came from a blackberry storm and this phone blows the bb out of the water. Great interface and has many useful apps.. 
Cons:. Camera is not as good as some phones out there but that doesn't effect me.. 

$$;
Pros:. The keyboard is easy to use, the 2.2 OS is great, great battery life.. 
Cons:. Screen is a little small switching from the Droid X.. 
Summary:. Bottom line, this is the best phone Verizon has in it's line up. I had the Droid X, and it was simply too big. I swapped it for the D2. It fits in my pocket better, the keyboard is nice to use when I get bored with Swype. The only draw back I see is, I got used to the 4.3 inch screen on the DX, so this screen seems a little cramped, but it is something I'll get used to. This is definitely the perfect phone until if/when Verizon gets the iPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome speed, especially with internet. Have been waiting for this phone for years. Finally a qwerty as good as iphone.. 
Cons:. Sometimes odd quirks when trying to answer phone while performing other tasks.. 
Summary:. For us business guys who hate typing on screen, this is the phone we have been waiting for.. 

$$;
Pros:. -It's finally rooted (YAY!). -Top of the line components. -Froyo Goodness. -Full QWERTY Keyboard. -FANTASTIC BATTERY LIFE. 
Cons:. With a protective cover, this thing is BULKY. 
Summary:. I just switched to Verizon after being a long time T-Mobile customer. Loved the customer service, but the all-important cell service SUCKED. Decided to try the original Droid on the 10th, and apparently was under a rock somewhere, because I didn't know they were releasing the Droid 2 2 days later. Paid my $35 exchange fee, and haven't looked back since!. I came to this device after being a self-professed HTC FANBOY, and must say, I never knew I was missing so much. While HTC Sense is an AMAZING overlay, they leave MUCH to be desired in technical design. I love the design of the Droid 2 and X. Something about them just screams, these are MEN's PHONES! The fact that I can go an entire day of use and not have my battery die sometime during the day is FANTASTIC!. I was worried when I heard that the phone came with MOTOBLUR, having seen how much it SUCKED on T-Mobile's Moto droids, but this version is great, and you can always add LauncherPro or ADW Launcher.. I've had this phone for about 3 weeks, and the ONLY thing I can think negatively about is how bulky this is with the protective case.... But that is HARDLY a con. If you're in the market for a top of the line Android device with a sliding keyboard, get the Droid 2.... You won't regret it!. 

$$;
Pros:. i can check my flash sites now!. 
Cons:. aside from some of the apps i gave up on the iphone, they are pretty much replaced 10fold with the inclusion of flash.. 
Summary:. had the hassle of an iphone for a while, now i am droid for life!. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone is so easy to use and the screen is awesome. The speaker function is the best, especially for 'texting' and not having to use your fingers. You can also "speak" to find places of interest for navigation or to call someone.. 
Cons:. So far, none. I've had the phone for about 2 weeks.. 
Summary:. I LOVE it and haven't found any problems at all!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Almost everything on his phone is a step up from the original droid. The U.I is so advanced &#38; there are so many great new widgets.. 
Cons:. The only thing i ran into was the battery life at first. I was able to fix it though.. 
Summary:. If you're looking for a worthy replacement for your original droid or if you're looking for a smartphone with a perfect QWERTY keyboard, then the DROID2 is the way to go. I had so many options &#38; i'm glad i made this one. Love my phone &#38; i'm glad it's replacing my D1.. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone is fast and the redesigned keyboard is actually quite easy to use. The "toned down motoblur" software is ok. It takes some getting used to, and can be a little annoying at times, but really not a deal breaker.. 
Cons:. The only complaint I can come up with is that the preloaded applications cannot be removed without rooting the phone (and thereby voiding the warranty). Some apps open themselves and run in the background, which can impact the battery life.. 
Summary:. Overall the phone is great. Solid construction including the sliding mechanism. The rubberized coating is also fantastic and serves to protect the phone. The display is crisp and responsive. No lagging in applications. Contrary to a couple of articles I have read, I have had no reception problems and the phone is nearly always in 3G. The websites load quickly and are easy to navigate. All in all, I am very pleased with the Droid 2.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone is so easy to use a Cave Man could use it. Screen quality is superb. Battery life is fantastic. I love the feel and if it's like the original Droid is very rugged and will keep on ticking drop after drop.. 
Cons:. I'm concerned in the future with Motorola selling their wireless division the quality and support will suffer. 
Summary:. Motorola have always made superb products. I started with the Razor, then got the original Droid. I've never experienced a single issue with either. I couldn't wait to get the Droid 2. I passed my Droid on down to my son. The Droid 2 might not have every bell and whistle some others promote but the bottom line is the Droid 2 is second to none in quality and dependibility. I love the Android system. Seems like everyday a hundred more apps have been made. I like the iPhone too. But when it comes to quality and dependibility the iPhone doesn't hold a candle to the Droid!. 

$$;
Pros:. Endlessly customizable, with widgets, the ability to root, download many apps, great physical keyboard, YouTube videos play smoothly.. 
Cons:. Touch screen is rather sensitive and is easy to touch the wrong thing. Sometimes experiences lag when exiting out of an app. The media player doesn't easily allow you to create playlists though it can be done. The video camera has no zoom feature.. 
Summary:. Except for the weaknesses with the camera and media player, this is a solid phone which feels really strong and sturdy in one's hands and is beefy enough to handle Flash videos and stream YouTube.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, Quick Office, GPS, Connection to the internet, keyboard, Alarm Clock. 
Cons:. Greatest Con is battery life. Internet usage is okay. GPS, you either need a car charger or your wall charger with an inverter. Phone will get hot too.. 
Summary:. I love this phone! It has Quick Office which is a simple version of Microsoft Office's programs: Word, Powerpoint and Excel. I have been able to keep up with working on my Grad school papers while waiting on my kids to get out of school, at the orthodontist office or wherever else I am waiting. I can do research as if I was at a computer despite the fact it is a small screen.. The keyboard is fine for my hands. Bigger hands would probably have issues with it. I would love to see a bluetooth keyboard and/or mouse be available for the phone.. The alarm clock is very handy and all you have to do is tap the screen to put it back on snooze.. I can clearly hear my telephone conversations, texting is easy, getting on the web is easy as well. I have been out to my best friends property way out in the country where cell service is typically sporadic and had great connection to the internet even when it would drop down from 3G to 1X.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is a great phone.Smooth Operating system, amazing with the google apps like chrome to phone, google voice and many others.You can watch full tv episodes from your phone,mp3's double as ringtones.Can't isn't something you will say with this phone. 
Cons:. I dropped my phone and the screen cracked pretty easy. I suppose this would happen with any touch screen. I really have no complaints about the phone. I've made I phone users upset a couple times with this phone.. 
Summary:. This phone is a can do phone. It has office mobile built into it and does everything i need it to and more. from gps navigation to doubling as an internet connection, it just can. The battery could always be better on any smart phone, but if i use it heavy it will still last about 24 hours. I've had it last about 2 days. Internet has Adobe Flash too. I could go on forever.... 

$$;
Pros:. fast web, camera decent, qw. keyboard good, lots of apps from android, good screen and colors.. 
Cons:. camera a little grainy, battery life so-so when you run apps and etc., wish it had front camera.. 
Summary:. great android phone! fast web, great screen and colors, overall experience with it good, batttery life is so-so, use appkiller it is a good app. camera decent, grainy at times. I dont find it heavy when carrying it. I thought abt the droid x but, I like mine smaller and the qw. keyboard. experience with the phone is satisfaction. good for college student with laptop. quick office is great for HR student to!. 

$$;
Pros:. Call quality is excellent, good battery life, respectable keyboard IMO, and very snappy.. 
Cons:. Interface isn't the best, though not bad.. 
Summary:. This is a good phone for anyone that wants a physical keyboard. I've had it for about a month now and I have no regrets.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, apps galore (lots are free), touch screen, design. 
Cons:. Not crazy about the keyboard, and battery life is not the best. 
Summary:. Well, this is my first Android phone and as you can guess I was very excited to buy the Droid 2. The very first thing I liked about the phone was its design. It is sleek and attractive. I also like the navy colour, even though I have a protective case over it. After playing around with the phone for a while, I realized that this phone's capabilities seem near limitless. Whether it's the navigation, skype, games, etc. I had a blast using apps from the Android Market. There is a ton of stuff to like about the Droid 2. I do have one problem though. I personally feel the need for a keyboard, and I am not very pleased with this. I do like raised keys. But I do find the keyboard a bit small and slightly difficult to type with. I actually find it easier typing on the touch screen with the phone turned horizontally. I use a carbon fiber type of protective cover, and this cover makes it difficult to type on the top row. Unless you have small, delicate hands, using a cover (or even not at all) you might not like using this keyboard. Besides the not so great keyboard, I think the phone does run out of battery a bit quicker than I'd like, but it still wont cause issues for me. The phone charges quickly.. Overall, I certainly am enjoying my Droid 2. I do recommend the phone for anyone who feels the need for a physical keyboard. If you do not feel the need for a physical keyboard, I suggest looking at the Droid X or Droid Incredible.. 

$$;
Pros:. keyboard, web browsing, apps, multitasking. 
Cons:. screen glare. 
Summary:. Overall, this was a smart move from the blackberry which just couldn't handle the internet. If all I was doing was sending and receiving email then the bb would have been fine.. The droid2 takes care of everything and does so in a great package. 

$$;
Pros:. Had the Droid 1 but returned it when I discovered it could not do voice dialing via bluetooth. Droid 2 &#38; Adroid 2.2 totally fixed the problem, works with my VW. Voice search is amazing and I can type on this keypad.. 
Cons:. Camera is just OK, battery life not great. Some issues with Cardock and screen going blank, still working on it.. 
Summary:. Get it, you won't be disappointed. Check out Gsynit for syncing with Outlook (great app).. 

$$;
Pros:. SUPER fast. Intuitive design. Excellent keyboard. 
Cons:. Battery life / management. Being stuck with some moto-apps7. 
Summary:. I watch the android revolution march on without me while I waited for my next scheduled upgrade - that cycle hit on launch day for the Droid 2. I moved on from an LG Dare... locked down phones tied to verizon's expensive apps = a very unhappy place. Now with my Droid 2 I have apps galore, a very intuitive and BLAZING FAST phone that pretty much removes my need to fire up my laptop during my daily train ride. That being said, battery life is a bit of a disappointment; running several apps with internet, bluetooth and gps will kill the battery in a few hours... more modest use will get you a day between charges at best. Still, overall it is the best phone out there for the money and on a network you can trust (sorry apple fan boys... nothing wrong with iPhone, but ATT is not the network for the NYC area). 

$$;
Pros:. no plasticky cheap feel, touch + very usable qwerty, 3.7" sized screen is just right for reading &#38; watching clips, FREE google nav (one of my main reasons for getting android), good selection of helpful &#38; fun apps, excellent call/spkrph quality.. 
Cons:. BATTERY LIFE. with the way they're cranking out smartphones like there's no tomorrow, you'd think we'd have a decent battery to go with all that innovation.. 
Summary:. i recently moved to SoCal from hawaii (which only has 3 freeways), so instead of tacking on an additional $10/month for vz navigator, which would've brought my monthly total to $30 extra anyway, i decided to jump the messaging phone ship for android. i spent the last year window shopping for a smartphone, thought the original droid was IT, until i tried the keyboard and found that my small hands couldn't get past the intrusive placement of the d-pad. almost a year later, out comes the droid2...right in time for my NE2 :) so i went into verizon to check it out, and found that the removal of the d-pad with the addition of slightly domed keys, made for an excellent typing experience.. so there went my two main selling points: free navigation and a good physical keyboard. the rest of the package is what nothing less than what everyone who loves their D2 is raving about. the touchscreen is responsive, bright, clear, and just the right size. browsing the web and downloading apps is VERY fast, absolutely no lag. switching between apps and different functions is instantaneous as well. i downloaded a task killer to help my D2 function smoothly...beware that some task managers KILL your battery, so read the comments before downloading.. "ninja"blur blends in really well with stock android, i personally like it very much. having 7 homescreens to categorize my commonly used tasks is wonderful. universal voice search is amazing...i can see myself getting spoiled with it!. call quality (after turning off voice privacy) is near perfect with some slight digital glitches when in areas with spotty reception. speakerphone is plenty loud and clear. ringers and notifications are nice and loud as well.. and last but not least, beware of the battery. mine isn't as bad as some people are complaining about, but be prepared to get an extra battery or have a charger handy at work and in the car. i'm sure my battery life will improve after i get over my current newbie addiction ;). overall, the D2 is almost perfect! it's fast, it's user friendly, and it feels like QUALITY. if you can't live without your hard qwerty and don't need a 4.3" screen, GET IT, you won't be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice touchscreen, keyboard doesn't bother me, easy to navigate, awesome sound quality.... 
Cons:. Short battery life.. 
Summary:. Obviously, the Droid 2 is relatively new. I was eligible for my 2 year upgrade, and knew the Droid 2 was about to come out, so I waited for it. I upgraded from a Motorola Krave ZN4, which was a pretty crappy phone in comparison. The Kraze had such a horrible touch screen that I refused to get a phone without a keyboard... hence, not buying the Incredible or the X.. I've read a couple reviews on here saying that the keyboard is hard to use, but I really disagree. Text messaging and even web surfing is a breeze. The Droid 2 also includes a touchscreen keyboard, which I tested out, and it turned out to be a major improvement from my last touch screen experience. If you want a hard to use keyboard, go buy the Krave.. Everything is really self explanatory about the phone - or at least speaking for the somewhat technologically advanced. I'm able to navigate through my phone quickly and easily - and since every screen is customizable, you can set up your phone in a way that's best for you.. Since I am a music geek, one of the first things I did with my phone was hook it up to my computer and pull over a small collection of music. I was amazed at the sound quality of the phone... it's pretty impressive, in my opinion. Clarity of phone calls is also extremely nice, whether using speaker phone or not.. Now the one downfall I've found with this phone, is the battery life really sucks. I guess that is sort of to be expected with smart phones, but even with the wireless, bluetooth and gps all turned off... I still don't get more than 16ish hours of battery life (assuming I am doing nothing on my phone). Using Apps, listening to music, phone calls, even texting, sucks the life right out of the battery. I realize I am still going through the "obsessed with my new phone" phase, so I am constantly playing with it - but it is annoying to have to charge your phone sometimes twice in a day. I am used to phones where I can go a week without coming close to a charger. I have read that there is a battery upgrade that can be purchased, which I will probably do in the near future.. Some other things of mention:. - Wide variety of downloadable apps, I've found some useful and fun ones that are completely free.. - Nice for social networking and emailing... as a just-out-of-college adult, I really like the integration this phone has with facebook.. - Love being able to set any of my own MP3's as ring tones and alarm tones. Also know that there is an application for creating custom tones, though I have not played with it.. - Being a mobile hotspot is pretty neat, I went on a business lunch a couple days ago and had everyone with smartphones connected to my network.. Overall, really awesome phone, and definitely a worthwhile upgrade for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android 2.2, touch screen and a physical keyboard.. 
Cons:. the keyboard keys seem a bit stiff, short battery life at first.. 
Summary:. When I got this phone the best buy rep installed task killer. The only thing it does is kill the battery. I could not get more than three to four hours at the most out of this phone. After some internet searching i decided to remove the task killer and now I can get 12 to 14 hours of battery out of this phone. This is my first smart phone and first android phone so now that I have learned the phone and all of its features I love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. BATTERY LIFE, BATTERY LIFE, BATTERY LIFE (Power mgmt). android 2.2. Full slideout keyboard. 
Cons:. occasional lag when too many apps open(not much of a problem). camera not up to par with competition, no front facing camera.. 
Summary:. I just switched from att (iphone 3g) to verizon and i first went for the htc incredible, which seemed to be a good pick because of all the positive reviews. while the incredible is a great phone(its fast, has most features one would want in a smart phone, the power mgmt is VERY POOR. The battery wont even make it through one day with moderate usage, and if it does, you have to tweak the phone to the point where its no longer a smart phone (turn off gps, wifi, btooth, 3g, turn vibrate off, turn off sync/push notifications) and doing anything was a chore. So i decided to try the droid 2 out. Now i can go at least two full days without charging my phone with moderate usage and i never turn off gps, wifi, btooth, 3g, and i never use a task killer(i actually never used one with the incredible either for more than a few weeks, it tended to interfere with push notifications and randomly opened other apps. Theres probably a reason google doesnt have its own task killer out) Bottom line is if your looking for a smartphone that is sleek, has a nice screen, a slideout keyboard and functions the way its supposed to without compromising battery life, this is the phone for you. if you want a phone with a front facing camera, or HD capture and output, and a massive screen, the EVO, droid x, or iphone 4 might be better for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Form Factor; Great Looks; Excellent Specs; Usable Keyboard; Fantastic OS. 
Cons:. Lack of Apps; Keyboard a bit klunky. 
Summary:. I got tired holding out for an iPhone on the Verizon network and finally decided to give up my blackberry for a Droid. Looked at the Incredible and Droid X and tried them out quite a bit. Came pretty close to getting the X, but then Engadget and buddies at work made me hold off for a bit.. Not disappointed a bit that I held off. The Droid 2 finally feels like a smart phone. Froyo is just awesome. It has been well package, the Moto UI is non-intrusive and the home screens concept is nice. The specs on the phone are very good and the camera is decent for pictures. I don't have to carry around my p&#38;s canon around anymore to the office - brainstorming pics are now going on the phone.. Definitely worth taking out for a cruise. I think I have found my phone for now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great display, great physical and virtual keyboards.. 
Cons:. Physical keyboard is a little cramped in the upper row and phone is a bit bulky with the case. Note that the touch screen glitches when plugged in (which is a problem for floor model demos).. 
Summary:. I was ultimately choosing between the Droid 2 and Droid X, and went with the Droid 2 for the physical keyboard, and the fact that the Droid X seems a little too big for a pocket. I'm still in my trial period and may yet make the exchange, but I'm loving the Droid 2 so far, even if it is a bit thick compared to the Droid X. Also, obviously the 4.3" screen on the Droid X makes for better web surfing than the 3.7" on the Droid 2, but the size of the screen comes with its own trade-offs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Keyboard.. GPS, WIFI, FLASH, app market, long extended-battery life, slim form factor, car mount, multi-media dock. 
Cons:. Motorola WI-FI widget and 802.11n issues. No HDMI output.. 
Summary:. I discover new apps &#38; features every day that my phone can do. And I discovered a surprising love for watching video, movies and television on my phone. With the various desktop sync and cloud capabilities, I may even re-think the need for a laptop.. But I unexpectedly HATE the Google calendar. I guess Palm is still the only one who has ever done calendars perfectly. I haven't decided on a substitute yet. But the app market is awesome and so easy to use. Plus I love trying new apps from developers whose stuff I already like.. Basically, I adore my phone, and my husband doesn't mind how much time I spend using it (for everything!), as he enjoys watching videos on it too. But I think my desktop computers are feeling neglected.. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid construction.. 
Cons:. Heavy to hold.. 
Summary:. This is a good phone. Froyo works well with this processor. It is a heavy hitter, but, it will withstand a fall because of its construction. Most people will adopt something less expensive and you will get what you paid for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Linux Based. Built in GPS. Internet Browser works well. I like using the Swype feature for short messaging.. 5 MP Camera albeit 8 would have been nicer. QWERTY Keyboard is descent on it too.. a lot of cool other features. 
Cons:. Battery. Verizon's Bloatware (You can get it off if you root the phone). The Motorola blur is sometimes slow but you can get around that.. 
Summary:. The D2 has a lot more features then the env touch and the speakers are great in it too. The big thing for me is that the battery sucks on it but if you have a smartphone you are going to have to live with that anyways. I have a couple of chargers so I can make sure that my phone does not die.. Before you buy one, see this http://www.Droid2Forum.net it's useful.. 

$$;
Pros:. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on. Touch screen is great and very responsive. This phone is pretty darn fast.. 
Cons:. I really don't like how I can't turn off haptic feedback. I've tried many times and it just won't turn off! This kills my battery. Also, can you say crapware? This phone comes with a bunch applications I will never use.. 
Summary:. This is a great phone. It's a solid 4 stars. If I could customize it a little more without rooting and if the battery was better it might be 5 stars. Besides those two things I love this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen....Apps galore....Interface navigations.....speed. 
Cons:. Without a gmail account you might as well not get this phone. 
Summary:. Got my hands on the love Droid 2 as a demo sent from Verizon to test out for business use. Must say am rather impressed with its overall function. Has plenty of droid apps to choose from Android as well as Motorola. The phone it self is very slick and slowly am becoming a bigger fan of touch screen texting, but if you do get tired of that, no fret there is a full qwerty keyboard! The only downside i see from a business side the notification screen on emails that are not based from a gmail account tend to get lost with a very limited notification screen even when placed on your home page. I noticed it will buzz when i got an email to my gmail account, while my outlook mail a small icon had popped up and gone away without any buzzing (probably a setting somewhere to fix this). Overall if i was able to upgrade my personal phone right now i would probably take this over a Droid X for the use of a keyboard which i would still need when writing those lengthy emails or text messages.. 

$$;
Pros:. super fast performance sleek looks decent keyboard mobile hot spot motoblir camera froyo sturdy device. 
Cons:. u have pay 20 bucks extra a month for mobile hotspot freezes does not let u use it while charging. 
Summary:. the moto droid 2 is great phone and is big improvement over the droid 1 i love it but their is some room for improvement. Updated. on Sep 16, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple integration. 
Cons:. Could not transfer my unused minutes(prepaid) to this phone. 
Summary:. I finally upgraded from a phone i had for seven years.....yes, seven years.....and i am glad i chose this phone. It was easy for me to use and the features are extremely intuitive, for me anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice features. 
Cons:. A little weighty. 
Summary:. Nice phone. The battery life is good. With moderate us I could probably go 2 days without charging it, but I manage tasks and screen brightness.. 

$$;
Pros:. *Fast response from touchscreen.. *Keyboard feels great.. *Swype is amazing!. 
Cons:. *Lags when too many apps running on background.. *Crashes too much.. *Camera too grainy even in good light and flash but camcorder looks great? Weird!. 
Summary:. -Pros. *Touchscreen is very responsive and so are the main buttons on the bottom.At the beginning the touchscreen had too much trouble reading what I typed but after a day of usage and I think of getting to feel being touched it works great!. *Keyboard is very nice and stylish and the keys are really good for typing. They aren't as good as the keys on the EnV2/3 or EnV Touch but they work well.. *Swype makes my typing much much faster and it is built in without having to download.. -Cons. *I have noticed that it lags too much when going from app to app and not using Task Killer.. *This bothers me too much because I listen to music on it a lot and I might just be doing that and it will crash and the screen wont respond no matter how long I wait and I just have to take the battery out and it is frustrating. Anyone know what might be the problem?. *Anyways, the camera is too grainy and not good quality...I can pretty much say the camera on my old EnV2 was almost the same or better than the Droid 2. But then again the camcorder looks amazing and much much better than my old phone. Anyone know why again?. 

$$;
Pros:. Froyo, responsive, nice screen.. 
Cons:. Keyboard just not a big leap over Droid 1. 
Summary:. Had been holding out to get the Droid 2 because of the physical keyboard. While the rest of the phone is greatly improved, they keyboard is only slightly improved, and very similar to the Droid 1's. Was hoping for individual keys (like the Ally, or Blackberry keyboards.). 

$$;
Pros:. Improved Keyboard. 
Cons:. Moto blur skin is a step backward from original Droid interface. 
Summary:. If you are a heavy user of the physical keyboard then this is a worthy upgrade. Otherwise, stick with your original Droid.. I was a big fan of the original Droid, although the keyboard was truly abysmal. The improved keyboard gives just a little more height to the individual keys, making typing considerably faster.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast processor, Froyo, more on-board memory than Incredible, keyboard better than original Droid. 
Cons:. Same processor as Droid X with a smaller screen and less flash memory, keyboard still not easy to type with. 
Summary:. I was eligible for an upgrade and had been holding off until the Droid 2 came out. I dutifully went to a Verizon store this morning and played around with the Droid 2, X and Incredible. I originally thought I would go with the Droid 2, but after using the keyboard and finding myself typing gibberish, I started exploring my other options. I actually found the virtual keyboard on the Droid X much easier to use, primarily owing to the much larger screen. I think the keyboard on my wife's LG Ally is much better than either the Droid or the Droid 2. If not for my desire to have a bigger screen and beefier processor, I might have leaned in the direction of the Ally over the Droid 2, especially given the fact that the Ally is practically being given away right now. You might find the keyboard on the Droid 2 to be fine, it really boils down to personal preference, but for my money, I think the Droid X is a much better option..

Pros:. Comes with Android 2.2, keyboard is very nice and easy to use, much more stylish than the original Droid. 
Cons:. Very short battery life, camera is horrible compared to my wife's HTC Incredible, and the colors are a bit dull and bland, and also a bit glitchy at times. 
Summary:. This is undoubtedly an awesome phone with some great features, but I find myself just not that satisfied because my wife got an HTC Incredible the same time I got my Droid 2 and it just seems much more refined. When you slide the the arrow to unlock the screen it's very choppy and not smooth, and the screen it no where close to being as vivid as the Incredible. I sent a pic we took with the Incredible to my Droid 2 and compared and it's night and day how much more vivid the colors are on the Incredible. The Droid 2 has a great feel to it, very well build and the keyboard is very easy to type on, I find myself using it a couple times a day for texting. My biggest problem is the ridiculously short battery life, my last phone was an EV3 and I would only charge it once or twice a week and I'm charging my Droid 2 at least twice a day, mostly because I'm using it a lot and the screen undoubtedly drains the battery. But I still find myself torn between keeping it or exchanging it for an Incredible or a Droid X. I still have about another 3 weeks to decide whether to keep it or exchange it, but I think I'll probably end up swapping it out since I don't want to keep kicking myself for the next 2 years..

$$;
Pros:. The Motorola Droid 2 offers a number of improvements that make it a worthy upgrade from the Droid and certainly a top choice for those who want a smartphone with a physical keyboard.. 
Cons:. It lacks HDMI port. Though the keyboard is better, keys are a bit stiff to press.. 

$$;
Pros:. QWERTY keyboard, Internet access, Sturdy. 
Cons:. Call quality, Battery life, Side buttons. 
Summary:. The qwerty keyboard takes a bit of getting used to. After using it for about 3 weeks I can feel my sliding mechanism getting looser, so much that it will pop open slightly on its own.. All the side buttons suck. The camera button is too flimsy and loose, the volume rocker is too small. The worst is the lock/power button which is hard to depress and find on the phone.. There have been several occasions where I will be dropped in the middle of a call. I have set the phone to make a sound when calls start or end, and it doesn't play it when the calls are dropped. It can get quite irritating when you're in the middle of a conversation.. The battery life on this phone is ok at best. I really use it for texting, occasional facebook/internet/email, and some voice calling. At first the battery would last half of the day. Literally from 7am to Noon. After doing some research and finding how to dim the display and use task killers etc, I've gotten the battery to last an entire day... at best. This means from 7am to 7pm without charging... this isn't terrible, but I would much rather have it last until 10 or 11 pm... Even though I've finally gotten used to the keyboard, I found the software a little clunky. I'm ultimately planning on trading this in for a DROID Incredible.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's really good. 
Cons:. It's really good. 
Summary:. Updated. on Oct 11, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. fast, at first. loved so many things about it &#38; used it obsessively for the first week.. 
Cons:. FREEZES Constantly! Right away, native music player was buggy. However, it steadily worsened and now the music player is worthless. Can't play more than 10 sec song &#38; it freezes solved by a battery pull. &#38; Why is the reset date 5:01pm Dec 31, 1969. 
Summary:. wait till Verizon fixes the bugs... 

$$;
Pros:. testing,testing. 
Cons:. testing,testing. 
Summary:. testing,testing. 

$$;
Pros:. Apps are great. Touch screen and buttons work very well.. 
Cons:. I wish the microphone on the phone worked -- can only talk to people if I use speakerphone. This is a problem for many Droid 2 and Droid X users.. 
Summary:. I wish Motorola would improve their quality control. I expect a phone, whether a smartphone or otherwise, to at least work as a phone. I used to have Motorola products that could survive abuse. My Droid 2 couldn't survive manufacture. The microphone does not work unless I turn on the speakerphone -- that is 100% unacceptable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Seems like a good android phone. 
Cons:. Battery doesn't last long. Syncing phone with Facebook and or Twitter automatically adds all friends/followers as contacts and you can't get rid of contacts. 
Summary:. This phone has potential but it wasn't really what I expected. Having around 400 contacts in my contact list is annoying. According to blogs, there's no way around it either. I'm slowly getting used to the physical keyboard and other basic functions as this is my first smartphone. I might switch to the X in the next week.. 

$$;
Pros:. The features are great, very versatile. 
Cons:. Getting things setup and apps to work can be time consuming. Some apps need to be reloaded a couple of times to work &#38; not hang. Wonder if I should have kept my phone and computer separate? Never had an issue with my 'phone'.. 
Summary:. The black screen of death appeared 45 days after purchase - just when I got the phone setup and working for me. What a hassle, now I have to start over. I thought I was the only one experiencing this - wonder how many Droid2 phones have crashed. Is it HW or SW?. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, android 2.2, keyboard. 
Cons:. I and many others can't make wifi work. My Xbox 360, wii, 3 computers and Ipod Touch work flawlessly on my wifi. The Droid 2 says it is connected, but does not transfer data. Many people as posted in many other forums say there is no fix for this.. 
Summary:. I and many others can't make wifi work. My Xbox 360, wii, 3 computers and Ipod Touch work flawlessly on my wifi. The Droid 2 says it is connected, but does not transfer data. Other people had to slow their wifi from 802.11n router to 802.11g. I refuse to do that. It should work out of the box like the Ipod. Wifi is pretty established technology. If I don't get a fix before the 30 days, this one is going back to the store.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Web browsing experience is excellent. 2. Call reception was superior to most smart phones. 
Cons:. 1. Inability to sync with Exchange server without purchasing beta versions of apps for $40. 2. Inability to use calendar feature unless it is synced with another calendar (ie Outlook, but you can't sync to Outlook). 
Summary:. This phone is ideal for teenagers/young adults who want to play videos/browse the internet and who have $200 to spend. It is NOT an enterprise solution for business. The inability to sync contacts/notes/calendar/email to an exchange server is dumb founding, as is the "solution" to route everything through a Google server. No company would ever agree to send proprietary email/contacts through a gmail account, and the bug in the calendar was the final straw. After spending 4 days searching forums and several hours on the phone with tech support, I am returning this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. good keyboard, bright display, works well as a phone. 
Cons:. The location based functions are unreliable because of a problem with the database. In my home county almost all map searches return results which are about 1/4 mile off from true location. Easy to get lost other location based searches off too.. 
Summary:. Useful phone, web browser, calendar and contact manager. Location based functions including search and navigation are useless with the native Android apps that come with the phone, because of problems with Google's database in my home area.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cool features like speech-to-text with navigation and texting. Plenty of wallpaper, ringtones, and alert tones from which to choose.. 
Cons:. Screen too sensitive.While touching just the edge of the phone, menus appeared. I disabled the feature that makes keys vibrate on touch, but they still vibrated. Phone is too heavy. Not crazy about physical keyboard either.. 
Summary:. I'm a techie, so I researched to death the Droid X and the 2 before finally settling with the 2. I was so excited to get it, but I started to hate the phone only a couple hours into using it. I couldn't believe that I didn't read about my problems in all the reviews I read. I really wanted to give it a chance, but alas I'm trading it in for the Droid Incredible!. 

$$;
Pros:. Uses Microsoft Exchange Sever instead of BlackBerry Exchange that is expensive to use.. 
Cons:. No spell check in email, text or documents. No app to add it. No way to search emails one the device it self. So if you have 20 from one person over 20 days you can't search through them to find one you might need. Bad or lack of cut and paste.. 
Summary:. Might be good for a kid but if you have to use for business stay or go to blackberry even though the BB exchange is more expensive for your company. I tried this and wanted it to work before I moved a few thousand employees over to the driod 2. But without spell check I don't want my sales force using it to send emails to customers.. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is beautiful and the interface is mostly intuitive.. 
Cons:. Signal strength issues. Neither the physical keyboard and the touchscreen keys are poor. It's too heavy. The physical buttons are small and hard to operate. Generally inferior to Blackberry in all respects when it comes to work.. 
Summary:. I came to this phone from a Blackberry Curve that was over two years old. The only spot where it beats the Curve is the screen, which is vastly better. But the Blackberry was engineered for people who actually need a mobile email device; the Droid 2 was engineered for people who like shiny toys. Now, I like shiny toys, but I expect them to perform. The Droid 2 barely scrapes by as my office phone. Problems include:. 1. Signal strength. It goes from four bars to zero and then back again, with call quality degrading accordingly. A friend's Verizon phone has more stable signal strength when laid beside the Droid 2. Worse still, it occasionally drops calls here in Madison, WI. That never happened with my Blackberry.. 2. It's heavy.. 3. The physical keyboard is not worthwhile. The keys are a bit too flat and the feedback from the keys is poor.. 4. The touchscreen keys are too small. I find it is slightly faster to use the screen than the physical keyboard. However, the dedicated smiley key is wasted space, and it's too easy to hit the smiley key accidentally. The automatic error correction feature is more of a hindrance. It is cumbersome to go back and correct text. The voice-to-speech uses childish abbreviations that are inappropriate for professional use, e.g. "ok i will c if u have finished later".. 5. It was a pain to set up with my existing POP email account. It mis-detected the server settings, it pulled messages from the server without my authorization, and it can't seem to mark messages as "read" on the server.. 6. Gmail is not included in the universal message box, which is preposterous. This is Google's OS, after all!. 7. The camera is grainy and ineffective unless you have great lighting. It also has the worst interface imaginable. There is a tiny button on the side of the phone that is hard to depress, and another button on the screen that is positioned so as to be useless.. 8. The other physical buttons are similarly small and hard to operate.. 9. It uses Micro USB, rather than the ubiquitous Mini USB.. It's a toy, and not a very good one at that. Maybe that's what most consumers want? I don't know. But with the exception of the screen, it is inferior to the prehistoric Blackberry Curve.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast processor relative usable keyboard for it size.. 
Cons:. Horrible email software. Expected better for something as basic as email. Customer support horrible with long wait to find out that your best option is to leave a message to have them call you back. Never buy a smart phone from Motorola again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android OS 2.2 with MotoBlur, nice car dock. 
Cons:. Runs very hot, processor overheats, battery life is horrible (3 hours with just cell radio active and just a couple basic apps running, like phone, task killer, etc).. 
Summary:. I replaced my Blackberry 8330 with this unit. I need email all day, and voice about 90 minutes off and on throughout. With the BB, I was able to get 12 or more hours between charges on a standard battery. On the D2 I cannot operate in my normal mode for more than about 3 hours - THREE HOURS!!! - and then I have to charge the blasted thing again! I really WANT to like this phone, but I can't with this kind of horrible battery life. I turned off every app, every service that was not crucial to what I do, and still the best I can get is three lousy hours. This is not a TOY for me, this is a vital part of my business, and I must have something reliable; this is not ready for prime time reliability.. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid Build, Nice Screen. 
Cons:. Signal (cell &#38; web), Battery life &lt; 5 hours. Heavy!  Top row of keypad hard to use.. 
Summary:. Purchased on 1st day.  At home/home office continued to loose signal draining battery life.  ATK didn't help, always had 10-12 apps running even after kill without using phone.  Heavy in pocket.  Reviewed the phone on VZ website, guess it was too negative, VZ hasn't posted, they probably only post the more positive ones. Makes you wonder how valid the ratings on their website are.  Returning and paying the $35 (stupid lesson fee) restocking fee.  Will wait to try any new phones, let other people be the tester.. 

$$;
Pros:. data plan is great. 
Cons:. cell phone quaility is very poor and verizon has not addressed concerns. 
Summary:. phone quailty is very poor, difficult to hear caller, dropped calls. i have been a verizon user for 10 years and have always been very happy with my cell phone service until know. Verizon store says they can not help me during my second visit, first visit they said the problems occured because of how I was using the phone. I followed their directions and still continue to have problems. i do not feel that I have a reliable phone, The ability to get e-mail, search net and gps is great, but I alsoneed a good phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. The camera is very, very good.. 
Cons:. The device has a tremendous amount of software bugs.  I have had my Droid 2 for less than one week and it has locked up at least 40 times.  The accelerometer has a mind of its own.  The keyboard has small keys, only good for small fingers.. 
Summary:. This phone is not what it is cracked up to be.  The battery life is terrible.  The phone gets so hot when in use that you can barely hold it.  It has software bugs everywhere.  It will, on its on, put icons on the home page that you can not access or remove without pulling the battery and powering back up.  Apps on the home page will not allow you to change, customize them which has to be another software bug.  The accelerometer will change the screen view for no reason whatsoever.  Call volume is poor.  When the phone is working, friends say they can barely hear you.  Ringer volume is low.  Notification of text message or email is nonexistent.  The browser is nice and works well but that is about it.  In a nutshell, this phone is terrible.  Nothing works like it is supposed to.  Don't be a guinea pig like me.  Steer clear of this not so smart device.. 

$$;
Pros:. internet access. 
Cons:. The screen/phone drops calls, or mutes, or connects to other contacts.. 
Summary:. If you're interested in using the Droid 2 as a phone, reconsider!! It doesn't work. 

$$;
Pros:. Not much...This phone is downgrade from in operating function from Driod1. 
Cons:. Exchange Sync does not work and Motoblur is a diaster on this phone. Read forum on Motorola before buying.. 
Summary:. Once you set up the Exchange Sync account for your exchange account the phone creates it own adminster rules requiring a pen number to log in and it cannot not be undone even if the exchange account is deleted. Motorola is offering not fix date. The DriodX is having even great problems with Exchange Sync. It all seems to be a result of MotoBlu overlay. 

$$;
Pros:. Fun to surf, good applications,. 
Cons:. Doesn't synch with Outlook, when you are on a call and want to use the screen it frequently won't wake up, not as fast as everyone says, even on 3G network, keyboard isn't great.. 
Summary:. I loved the phone at first until I realized that it didn't update my outlook contacts. So calls will come in without identification and when I am in the field I cannot find the contacts to call out. My IT person researched it and found the web ablaze with the exact same complaints from other users. For me, this is almost the most important thing my cell phone can do so I am taking it back.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has a lot of gadgets to consume your time.. 
Cons:. My husband and I both bought the Droid 2 phone a month and a half ago; his died then mine.. It is heavy and cumbersome, does not connect well to the bluetooth in my car, and the voice quality is poor.. 
Summary:. I would not submit such a horrific review, but Verizon has not been pleasant about the situation. "Oh! that's too bad," and now you have to go without a phone for 4-5 days and we will send you one by Fedx; phones in store are only for sale and not for replacement. Of course, you are not home for the delivery and have to wait another day to receive the phone. Now you are responsible for downloading everything to the new phone.. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Verizon is becoming a monopoly and you are at their mercy....
