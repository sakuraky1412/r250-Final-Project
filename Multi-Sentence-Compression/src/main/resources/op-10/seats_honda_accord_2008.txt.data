No memory seats, no trip computer, can only display outside temp with trip odometer .
hard seats, hard ride, more road noise than expected, disappointing gas mileage .
5 Seats= Like sitting on a church pew .
Ride is superior, comfortable seats, radio excellent .
You get a V, 6, heated leather seats, XM, 18  rims .
Only needs to add drivers seat memory, 2, tone perforated leather, xenons, rear seat interior illumination mounted under front seats, and better tilt .
I haven't had any back pain from the seats, maybe these people exceed the seat weight limit ?
we don't need moonroof, heated seats side mirrors we live in S .
Seats are a bit too firm for me .
Problems with steering wheel, windows & seals, seats   .
