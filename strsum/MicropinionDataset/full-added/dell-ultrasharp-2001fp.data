i bought this in fall of 2001 and i still use it  .
that's exactly nine years  .
not only does it work , but everything still works like new  .
i cannot believe how good the technology is back then  .
it rivals current technology believe it or not  .
the vga input works perfectly and i never used the dvi input until just a few weeks ago (9 years after purchase) and it works great  .
this monitor was not even made to use hdmi since it was not even invented at the time , but with an hdmi to dvi adapter , you can use this just like you would use your brand new lcd hd tv  .
i'm not even trying to sell the thing because it works so great  .
why fix something that is not broke  .
this monitor receives heavy usage , including all 4 perfectly working usb 2  .
0 ports  .
talk about a great investment  .
i could sell this today and it would work the way it worked 9 years ago  .
i've had this monitor for over a year , and i still love it  .
when i'm using another computer , i cannot wait to come back to mine  .
) great color rendering    it works wonderfully with my color    calibrated setup .
i've been using this monitor for over a year for adobe apps (and youtube) and it's still beating out all the new dells coming into the office in the last year  .
had a 2005fp for a while and now it's sitting right next to a 2007fp , and the 2001fp is still the photoshop champion  .
the picture quality is gorgeous  .
there is no light falloff in the corners or at the edge , and white looks like white by comparison the 2007fp next to me is a greener shade of white and has a noticeable pixel screen door effect  .
colors are harsh by comparison  .
i'm noticing tiny text in an aim window is actually difficult to read , but not so when i move the window to this monitor i can compare this 2001fp to a cinema display and easily get lost in debating the fine details , but the 2007fp is not even in the same league  .
get a 2001fp for less if you can find it in stock  .
i find this product a superhero on ur desk because of it size and work do not believe what they say about the bad things of this lcd they are just some people from other companies i have i try it it's woooooooow  .
but as i saied about the coast so i live in lebanon (middle east)and here we have a lot of taxes so 1000$ are no comments but the service is very good and i'm so convainced .
brilliant  .
if you're a videophile then perhaps you'll be put off by the fact blacks are not amazingly black  .
but otherwise , in general use and in most games , videos and even in productivity use    this monitor is brilliant .
this is the best monitor i've ever used  .
except for one problem  .
it's dimensions are not exactly 4 by 3 , even though it is a 1600x1200 pixel display which should require a 4 by 3 panel  .
it's about 10% wider than 4  3 , making the images stretch just a touch after a bit of research though , it seems no company makes a 20 or 21 lcd that is perfectly 4  3 , and under $1000  .
for some reason these size monitors are used mostly for portrait instead of landscape viewing  .
but i still cannot figure out why they are using the 4  3 pixels other than that oddity , this monitor is the best you can get for the money  .
wait for dell to put it on sale , which it does at least once a month , and you'll be in heaven .
what a beautiful monitor  .
it is replacing my older p991 19 trintron crt that is fading  .
(a great monitor in it's own right)  .
i have found nothing wrong with this new screen  .
no dead pixels , colors are perfect , no blur effect  .
i am using a x800xl 256meg x16 video card  .
this i know makes a difference  .
the 16ms response time is at the highest i want it to be  .
12ms would be better if you watch the dell site and pay attention you can get this one at a good price  .
it is listed at $759  .
00 i paid $539  .
00 on sale my only regret is that i can not afford the 2405fpw 24 dell monitor  .
even on sale it is too expensive for me  .
that monitor is the ultimate  .
my friend owns that one and it is jaw dropping beautiful  .
this monitor is just behind it and just as beautiful in pic quality just not widescreen highly recommended  .
i have had mine for about 2 months and am very impressed  .
originally i is looking @ the apple display but the price difference ouch  .
very pleased  .
would another one  .
i would like to have dual inputs but that is not a must have for me .
i waited a long time to get an lcd monitor and is apprehensive since i always thought crts were far superior  .
also heard about a screen door effect this monitor supposedly produces  .
the minute i turned it on i is blown away by the clarity , crisp images and type and brightness  .
after much research i believe for the price it's the best monitor you can buy , especially if you wait for a promotion at dell .
i bought this monitor from dell when they had it on sale for far less than it normally goes for  .
i have zero complaints thus far  .
when the monitor arrived , there were no dead pixels and after about 6 months it is still in top shape i've also played a decent number of fps games using this monitor and it looks great  .
there are monitors out there with faster response times , but i have not noticed any ghosting or decrease in quality of gameplay at all also , i love the picture    in    picture feature  .
i do a decent amount of work from home , and it is nice to be able to pipe my tv    signal into the monitor in a small window in the corner , while i still have most of the screen real estate available to me  .
there is a nice set of controls for changing the size and location of the pip window as well overall , this monitor has been a great investment over the big , old , hot crt that used to sit on my desk .
this monitor has a high resolution , but its anti    glare coating may become a very big problem , because coating is clearly visible if your eyes are picky  .
coating looks as if the screen is dirty  .
if you search on the internet , you may find many other reviews describing this problem  .
coating is less visible on dark colors , but causes dirty look especially on white colors  .
i do coding and my eyes end up focusing on the coating of the screen instead of the code that i write  .
i see it even from 4 meters away from the monitor  .
coating also causes blurriness , so you may end up missing the details of images , so this monitor is also not very suitable for photo editing  .
i tried to get used to the coating , but i could not  .
if your eyes are not sensitive , you may not have such problems  .
in this case , this monitor can be a good choice for you .
this monitor is well regarded , after much research , i bought it despite misgivings about dell's poor customer service , but it seemed like a great deal , $440 , free shipping  .
huge mistake the monitor had severe light leaks all around the screen , really bad in the corners and left side  .
you could not miss this defect if you were blind dell told me i could exchange it , but only for a refurbished unit  .
pay for new monitor , get a refurbished monitor  .
what's up with that  .
stay away from dell , no matter how good the deal is  .

Price, Contrast is increadable, games are perfect.; Monitor is not a 4:3 size, but uses a 4:3 pixel settings, so images are a bit stretched.
