i've been waiting for samsung to fix this tv and they finally have  .
the buzz is really no longer and issue the blacks have become much better , the speed of connecting to the net has improved and the color accuracy are just unbelievable  .
the most amazing thing is the energy savings  .
everyone is telling me this is going to suck 250watts or so  .
i've had this hooked up to a voltage/watt meter and it has been humming at 122 in and 108 out  .
just a bit more than a 100 watt bulb  .
in fact my 32crt is pushing 277 watts so i should save a buck or so a month  .
very happy about this .
coupled with even a half    way decent home theater system , you will not be disappointed  .
i added a samsung digital home theater system and can control bot the tv and reeiver/blueray player from one remote  .
my family is enthralled by the picture and the size made viewing a pleasure from anwhere in our living room  .
now if i can just get them away from it so i can watch some of my favorite shows  .
running directv high    def receiver with hd package is a learning experience  .
you have to ensure you reconfigure your directv receiver to accomadate the video and audio setup  .
once that is done , you will be amazed  .
i dont know what to say other than wow  .
for the price , just about anyone can afford to have a solid and true hd experience of your own and on a screen that you will not regret  .
thumbs up samsung  .
you won my decision from panasonic .
i highly reccommend  .
i have had this model for about three months  .
i have been doing resarch on plasmas over the last couple years  .
remote easy to use  .
looks great , front has glossy shine and you do not see the speakers  .
i is able to get a great price on this model and bought it over the internet  .
standard shipping is fine , so save your money good things come to those who wait  .
i is and still am exited about my purchase  .
hd tv is now a must  .
i hove you find this helpful .
i did a lot of research before buying this particular tv  .
i narrowed it down to this samsung , and the panasonic viera th    50pz800u  .
i ended up with the samsung for 2 reasons  .
1st reason is the price  .
the samsung ended up being just a liittle ujust expensive  .
the 2nd reason is the overall look of the tv  .
my wife wanted the shiny blakc finish , and if she is going to let me buy a plasma i was not going to argue with her  .
overall i love this tv  .
i have a 57'' rear projection sony as well and i have a hard time watching it  .
i cannot get over how clean , crisp , and overall awesome the colors and picture are  .
also i would recommend plasma in general over lcd i just prefer the picture more .
simply put if 1500$ is your price range you cannot go wrong with this display , i got this on sale at sears and had to pay $1399 best money i have spent in along time i get to come home and enjoy it every night nothing compares  .
wish it had better sound but almost all the flat panel tv's have sub par sound  .
great price , i paid 1400 .
so far , i believe i purchased the perfect tv for me  .
i bought a lg 720p at costco and the reflexion is way too much , colors were unreal and had not enough adjustments , i brought it back and bought this for 400$ more and it worth all the pennys i tryed batman the dark knight on a toshiba lcd and this samsung pn50a550 and for the fluidity and the contrast in night scenes and also the blacks , the samsung won  .
the black frame looks better then the red touch of color  .
if you like watching movies and sports , the plasma is a lot better .
let me start by saying that this is a beautiful television  .
you will be hard pressed to find one that will produce such vibrant colors that also can process fast movement as well as this one  .
the extended life of this plasma has reached 60 , 000 hour b efore half luminosity (that is 20 years at 8 hours a day i believe)  .
this television is also wonderful in our family room that has 4 windows , all four of which are south facing and high on the wall to let sunlight in during the afternoon  .
i have had no issues with the brightness  .
i have heard that samsung's customer service is nonexistent , so that may be a sticking point for you  .
overall , i would encourage anyone to purchase this tv  .
you will not be dissappointed  .
be sure not to leave the tv on its side for long during transport  .
warm it up in the house before plugging it in  .
and always protect from burn in during first couple weeks by running low brightness  .
etc  .
i purchased the television in around 12    18    08 from sears and i paid 1260 after discounts and before taxes  .
that is with 10% off for use of sears card at the sale price of 1399 .
a steal  .
50 inch plasma that is top rated and has accuracy , high    end processing , plenty of connections and customizable options  .
sleek look and thin .
i is looking hard at lcd's , but ended up with the samsung 50 plasma  .
i chose it because i could not justify the $800 price difference between this tv and an lcd with 120hz  .
cnet had this as one of the best hdtv's to date  .
consumer reports rated this samsung as the best plasma tested  .
i went to circuit city and looked at them all , including the panasonic  .
this tv had as good or better picture than any tv i looked at  .
i've had it for about a week  .
so far i am very pleased .
after reserching for several weeks and debating between panansonic th50pz85u , i purchased samsung pn50a550 , 1 wk ago from bb on sale  .
i am very happy with the purchase  .
there's very minimal diff in picture quality compare 85u but a550's picture/colorlooked more vivid and clear to me  .
i like the sleeker frame/design , more controls , base that swivel , etc those little things made the difference for me  .
great buy  .
be aware of extra warrenty monster cable sales pitch by the sales person which i declined all  .
they will really make you feel guilty for not purchasing them .
the best tv for the money  .
samsung has decided to stop making plasmas  .
so this model could be hard to find  .
but very worth it if you do  .
the colors are nothing short amazing  .
the blacks are a little grainy like stated in the cons but it is something that i can live with  .
tov avoid the samsung customer service horror stories , simple buy the extended warrnty from best buy or other electronic stores .
this samsung model replaces a sony lcd hdtv , which has served me well  .
i chose this samsung model because first , the overall picture quality is better than the dlp models and lcd's  .
the picture is brighter and more vibrant with terrific clarity and coloration  .
i mostly watch sports and also noticed that with the dlp tv's and some lcd's , there is blur during fast motion sequences  .
i did not see this problem at all with this tv and it has not been a problem at home  .
i have nfl sunday ticket hd and the picture quality is amazing  .
non hd channels are not nearly as impressive , but the picture qualty there is solid  .
cnet dinged this tv over its anti    glare technology  .
i have a wall to the left of this tv that is nothing but windows and have experienced no glaring issues  .
set    up is very easy  .
the tv comes well packaged and already on its stand  .
it is easy to lift and connections were a breeze  .
the remote is easy to use and menu functions are easy to use  .
the remote lights up which is great when viewing in the dark speaker sound quality is not good , like it is coming through a tunnel  .
there is an equalizer that helps some , but you're best bet is to use separate speakers and an a/v receiver screen burn    in is a possibility with plasma , but there are features built into this model to help make burn    in unlikely  .
use the features and you should not have any problems price played a role in my decision  .
for the overall picture quality and features , i found it hard to justify paying more for a panasonic plasma or a sony lcd model  .
however your personal taste may say otherwise  .
i do think this samsung tv is worth comparing to other models of interest  .
it may end up being your favorite .
after months of deliberation , i finally decided upon this set because it presented as such a great value  .
i couldn't justify the pioneer 5010 for at least 30% more $  .
there just is not that much of a difference between the two sets  .
i stood in a showroom and looked at them side by side on several occasions and liked the black levels of the kuro , but colors (especially the green) and overall image on the sami sold me  .
purchase without reservation you wo not be disappointed  .
looks much better than my 500 series pani .
i wrote a complete review for the 58 model , check it out .
i researched tv's to find best for money i had  .
samsung plasma seemed best bet  .
however , that is based on presumption that set is made in company factory , by samsung trained techs , in appropriate assembly environment  .
that is not what i have  .
i have a refurbished set at new price the tv    when working    is great  .
but samsung has worthless customer service that lies outright , stalls , claims to be escalating to executive customer relations (ecr)    but did not do so until 4th demand  .
ecr is also worthless , simply repeated ad nauseum no exchange if set can be fixed  .
no consideration of my point about it now being not new but refurbished  .
refused to give name of contact in head office , just blanket address to office of the president  .
other posts have said letters never answered  .
mine either , so far  .
bottom line    would not buy samsung product again without strong non    samsung extra warranty be warned if you are thinking of buying any samsung product  .
they do not stand behind their products .
at first i is a little apprehensive but i bought it any ways  .
i really is looking to buy a panasonic th    50pz800u , but there were no dealers around me  .
i am one to see before i buy  .
i do not like to buy from the big box stores ; i  .
m one for those who specialize in specifics and customer service  .
they turned me on to the samsung ; the price is $1000 dollars cheaper than the panasonic  .
yes the black supposedly are stronger on the panasonic than the samsung and the panasonics has thx mode  .
me not knowing a lot about these things i probably wouldn  .
t know unless they where side by side  .
very user friendly right out of the box and easy to setup .
i upgraded from a samsung 32 lcd , so this 50 looked embarrassingly large in its place  .
at first i felt that perhaps i had overdone it a bit , but i'm quite used to it now  .
) i really love this tv perhaps it's not the best tv available , but it is for the money  .
i am more of a consumer reports kind of guy       i think value should warrant as much attention as performance when evaluating a product  .
sure , the pioneers and some of the panasonics may have better blacks , but how much are better blacks worth  .
this model is under $1 , 400 when i bought it and those others are $2 , 000+ plus  .
in my opinion the blacks just are not worth that much so if you are interested in value this tv's cost  benefit is unbeatable , at least for now .
this is my first plasma ; i have a uk version ps50a558 that is identical to this one  .
i is on the net for months looking around for my first purchase  .
had this now for three weeks , i is initially concerned at reading some of the uk forums full of negative stories about this product  .
what finally persuaded me were the cnet positive reviews  .
i have to say the picture is perfect , i thought it would be fuzzy as in the uk we do not have a lot of high definition broadcast yet , it is still pretty much standard definition (sd)  .
sd transmission is not bad at all  .
some programs are crystal clear so much so you can see the zits and sweat on people  .
s faces  .
not that this should be the buying point  .
some of the older programs are not so clear  .
overall i am really happy with my purchase  .
there are between 20    35 picture controls so you can really tune up the picture to your desire  .
if anything the only negative point i would remark on is the contract resolution , the tv should have had this higher , i am running at close to the highest contract level with medium setting on energy saving  .
this tv allows you to set the energy it consume to low , medium or high the pay off is you loose some contrast on the picture  .
the sound is not that good , but i knew this having read all of the reviews , i have a panasonic home cinema sound system , so sound is not the reason i purchased this item  .
i bought this for the kids as they were hassling me and they love it , lets face it most of the time this tv will be used to watch kids programs like disney channel etc , i have not yet linked up to blu    ray or ps3 , only because i don  .
t have one  .
overall i am cool with this product and no doubt an improvement on my previous traditional sony and jvc 28  .
tellies  .
i have put it on a cantilever stand and it looks brilliant , a floating television  .
the tv is slim black bezel , very shiny  .
does attract does , so i bought a small smooth duster which i use to swipe on it every now and then  .
for the price this is a great tv , yes you could get better picture and better sound , but then be prepared to pay between �300    �1000 more for the best models on the market , this tv fit well for price and quality .
ok , did i did a ton of research and wanted the best plasma set i could get for under $1400 bucks  .
the picture does not disappoint  .
no picture complaints at all  .
i also plugged my macbook in and the screen is more than detailed enough to use it as a giant monitor the main drawback is how quickly the set retains images  .
i've got my xbox 360 plugged in via and i really feel i have to limit the amount of time i play to insure that the bright hud doesn't burn in  .
even after just an hour i can still see some residual image and have to run the screen burn protection  .
if you'd like to play extended sessions like me you'd better be careful  .
there's probably some technical reason for this , but the pixel shift mode for screen burn protection wo not work if you plug in via hdmi  .
which is a shame because if you've got a tv like this you'd better be using hdmi for everything  .
i cannot comment on the speakers but for god's sake , if you're getting a tv like this how can you not have a surround sound system  .
it's all or nothin' , baby  .
all    in    all this tv rocks and i highly recommend it to anyone who has their heart set on a plasma  .
i watch lost on it every week after downloading the high res version from xbox live  .
the viewing experience is epic  .
there is alot of talk about when you put you screen on all white you will see green the good news is that for the past couple of years quality manufacturers have been steadily working on improving plasma technology resistance to burn in with great success  .
one technique used is motion adaptive anti burn in technology , which focuses on moving the on    screen image ever so slightly  .
the goal is to avoid detection by the human eye , but still move the image enough to cause color changes in the pixels  .
a second improvement by some manufacturers is improvement in the phosphor gas itself in order to make it more resistant  .
the green phosphor is the most important in this process  .
this is also a key element in increasing phosphor and screen lifespan to crt levels (2) know that plasma screens are more prone to burn    in during their first 200 hours of use  .
when phosphors are fresh , they burn more intensely as they are ignited  .
this means that relatively new plasma display tvs are prone to ghosting , which occurs when on    screen images appear to stay on the screen belatedly  .
this is a function of the high intensity with which new phosphors pop , and this phenomenon usually washes out on its own , as the screen displays subsequent images  .
displaying a bright , or moving snow image (as with a dvd or vcr with no input) will wash a ghost image from the screen in most cases  .
many plasma manufacturers have installed anti    burn settings , which are monotone gray or snow screen settings which recalibrate pixel intensity levels uniformly    thus eliminating any image retention (ghosting)  .
it is a good idea to run this type of program after the first 100 hours or so this is just something that you guys need to know and will help better your plasma's life  .
updated  .
on feb 1 , 2009  .
i have not experienced any level of buyers remorse with this tv which cannot be said with some of my other purchases in the past .
i own the pn58a550 model  .
the above review used to be correct , however samsung came out with a firmware update that solved the pink hue problem  .
however , the new problem is that whenever there is an image on the screen that has a straight edge , that image bleeds all the way across the screen and on top of anything in its path  .
it happens on all the 550 and 650 models  .
go to the store and see yourself  .
its most apparent on the green preview screen that comes up before movie preview , but you can also see it when you access the menu and highlight a submenu option  .
look to the right and left and you will see color bleeding lines going across the screen on certain background colors read the avs forums and its a common issue  .
trying to get samsung to fix it right now , and if not , i'm going to have future shop replace is with the panasonic model would be the perfect set otherwise .
after doing about 3 months of research , i'm extremely happy i purchased this tv .
we've had this tv for about 5 months now and we're very happy with it especially for the very reasonable price we paid ($1400)  .
this tv replaced a failing samsung dlp tv and the difference in picture quality is considerable , even over the quite good dlp tv the wife and i agonized over whether to spend the bucks on a comparable lcd unit or go with the tried and true plasma  .
this is still an ongoing heated debate among aficiondos of hd tv's  .
lcd's are certainly improving each and every year but for the money , imho you cannot beat the plasma the color production of this unit is bar none , the best i've ever owned and on hd channels the picture quality is sublime with the sole exception being the very best and most expensive hd models  .
i didn't notice the black levels mentioned in the editor's review and i suppose that's a side    by    side comparison issue  .
all said , i have really no major complaint about this tv , the picture quality is terrific and everything i had hoped it would be  .
for the money , it's a damn good buy however , it should be noted that plasmas do use more power , generally , than a comparable lcd  .
i personally haven't notice much change in our monthly bill but that could be because the dlp's have similar power consumption  .
plasmas can run a little warm but it's really not a concern unless you install the unit into tight spaces in a console or entertainment center  .
plasmas can also run on the heavy side so mounting to a wall requires greater care and most definitely a stud or two to mount into if none of those issues are major concerns , as they were not with me , then i can whole heartedly recommend this tv or a similar unit from samsung  .
we are very happy with this tv  .
the antireflective screen is not a screen at all  .
what samsung and probably everbody else did is paint the back of the glass with a purple color  .
imagine using a spray paint can and spraying a purple paint on the back glass , going from left to right and watch it run  .
do about 4    5 lines like this  .
that is what they did  .
at first i thought i is seeing things , but as the days went by i saw the whole picture  .
i bought mine at cc and called them up the first week  .
the salesman told me it might be the antireflective stuff but i thought it is supposed to be another screen  .
so i called samsung  .
that customer service man laughed at cc's suggestion and never heard of any purple paint  .
so i took the tv back and got another  .
i am disabled and this is very hard to do  .
so , i bought another one  .
same pn50a550  .
no sooner had i hooked it up than there is the same material on the back of the screen  .
i couldn't see it at cc as you cannot stop the picture and look closely at it  .
now , i'm the one that is the fool  .
nobody at cc or samsung could tell me with certainty what the discolorration is about  .
they all should have known in a second  .
now i have to decide wether to take it back again or live with the problem  .
as i said , for the most part i cannot see it  .
but it is always there  .
and it does not help with reflections at all  .
cnet is to be blamed also  .
they should have seen this and told us  .
we rely on their expertise more than anbody else's  .
so , if you can get by with light blue skys , white backgrounds , and light faces that have a touch pink    purple all the way across them then this hdtv will work for you  .
i have a 60in mitsubushi hdtv also and the colors are more impressive in the samsung  .
there are differences in both of them  .
i get more of a 3d effect from the mits while the sam brings the picture closer  .
having only had the sam for three weeks i am sure i will see more differences  .
there are 720p hdtvs out there that are just as impressive as this 1080p and are cheaper , but i wanted a 1080p and to not spend over $2000 for it  .
so i guess i will stick with the samsung  .
otherwise i would have bought the panasonic 800  .
i bought mine before nycelectronic wrote his review  .
his review is right on  .
mine explains what the pink is  .
i also played prey on the sam and the colors were dazziling  .
there is some pixilating on hdtv when watching some sports  .
but it is hard to tell if it is my tv or the camera shooting the action that is at fault  .
sound is really good  .
lots of options and i am impressed  .
i do have a 7  .
1 onkyo with polk speakers (4 tower) on the mits  .
so i know what sounds good  .
thats all for now .
first let me tell you that right now i am watching sunrise earth (machu piccu) and the pq is spectacular  .
for 30 days i owned the top of the line samsung ln52a750 but returned it due to (lcd) motion blur  .
it too had terrific pq but this a550 is better  .
for the most part the pn50a550 is very very good  .
i watched this very same episode of sunrise earth on the a750 and can tell you that this a550 is clearly better  .
it matches the spectacular color of the a750 but absolutely has more depth , richness and black level performance  .
overall , after user menu color adjustments , gamma (    2) and other adjustments are made and of course with a high quality source the pq is truly stunning  .
however , there are some really frustrating annoyances which i will now list  .
first off the speakers and audio quality is average at best  .
the audio is hollow sounding even after custom adjustments  .
and , do not even think about turning the sound up loud because you will hear distortion  .
yes , i do have a high end av system but i do not want to use it for watching normal tv programming  .
there is some ir (image retention) but not all of the time  .
my major frustration comes from what i would call color blotching  .
let me explain  .
if you go through the menu system and find the screen burn in protection and select 'white screen' you may find as i and others have that the screen is not white in all areas  .
in fact , my screen has a green tinge in much of the center third of the screen that can not be calibrated or adjusted out  .
what this means is that when watching tv if you are paying attention you will see this in the image you are viewing  .
for example , while watching the olympics , in the middle of my screen i saw greenish tinted center court in basketball and greenish tinted sand in volleyball  .
while the left and right sides looked normal  .
i would hope that this would be just my unit but i have read here on cnet and on the avsforms page for this display that others have same experience too  .
after copying down my user menu settings , i plan to box this up and exchange it for another unit  .
if this issue is a quality control issue then samsung needs to do a better job and not let these units out of the factory  .
if they were to improve qc and put in better quality speakers this panel would easily merit a 8  .
5 because it would be that good  .
as it is now and until i swap it out i can only give it a 7  .
if i can update this after i make the exchange i will do so updated  .
on sep 20 , 2008  .
very nice tv , but apparently many samsung models have problems with an engineering flaw that produces a crackling sound  .
the manual says this is due to environmental conditions and is nominal  .
if i had a choice i would probably buy this tv again , but samsung engineering needs to get their act together and address this issue  .
i is surprised that so many reported cases on the internet that the support line had no idea what i is talking about and is not able to offer any help .
fortunately i'm still within my return window , i will be taking this tv back  .
it's a shame because i really liked this tv on so many levels  .
however the image retention is a deal breaker .
i am very disappointed in samsung's customer service and have filed a complaint with the bbb .
i own a pn63a650 not a pn50a550 but want buyers to be ware  .
what i am seeing is the same for any size samsung plasma and any of the 450 , 550 and 650 series my set exhibits a pink background in three areas on the screen  .
i went to my local circuit city and sound advise and looked at all their samsung plasmas  .
all the samsung plasmas exhibited the same problem though on different areas of the screen  .
there is one samsung 50a450 that is perfect or the way plasmas are supposed to be at sound advise their 58a650 had a pink band from left to right about 4 inches wide about 10 from the top of the screen if you ask the salesman to put on the white screen , which can be found under the screen burn in protection menu , it is instantly visible  .
what you see on this screen is in the background of anything you watch white snow looks slightly pink and sky scenes look like sunset scenes now for the good picture is the best of any large plasma i have seen or own  .
i own 4 other plasmas  .
this is supposed to replace a 5 year old 50 pioneer  .
i also own a 65 50 panasonic and a 42 hitachi i used the calibration that plasma buyers guide posted and the only alteration i made is changing the temperature setting from warm 2 to normal the picture is incredible  .
flesh tones are real with all the color popping you would expect from a hd set without exaggeration truth be known , i don't know what else to buy since i've seen what an accurate large screen can do  .
the panasonic 65 and 60 pioneer 6020 dont come close  .
yeah blacks are better on the panasonic and pioneer but they do not have the movie realism or depth that the samsung has if there is no problem with the pink cast i would have rated this set a 10 or higher if possible  .
i love the set but cannot live with the problem minor complaints  .
no finger or handles to hold while lifting a 140 pounder  .
no presets for each input nor a way to lock your setting so nobody changes them on you .
i own the uk version of this model and can report that contrary to the review , it suffers from incredibly bad false contouring (aka posterization) , and also a serious loss of focus on moving backgrounds which causes a noticable flicker    forget watching sports on this  .
it's not my set at fault , as many many people reported the same issue in other av forums it is ridiculous that this review does not pick up on these issues , as they are so blatantly obvious and could easily spoil your viewing with this tv .
overall , i really loved the television set until one evening the screen had some sort of issue and left the screen all black with a huge crack down the right side of the glass  .
i would have replaced the set if i had caused the damage , but the set has been mounted on the wall for six months with no issue  .
i have been dealing with good ol' samsung warraty support for the last 2 weeks and have not been given an answer  .
i have done everything i personally could to prove and verify i did not damage the set , including sending pics numerous time , inviting them to send technicians to my home to examine and try to find where i caused the damage  .
so i guess in a brief summary , the product is great , picture is perfect , until it stops working altogether  .
i guess this is what i should have expected from a company with a bbb score of f  .
buy a product from a company who backs their products , i guess i learned the hard way this company is not samsung .
worked great for 7 weeks   nice picture with great resolution and color depth  .
had minimal glare in a sunlit room  .
however , if it breaks , you're screwed  .
samsung refered me to a local repair company who has not been able to fix problem promptly  .
the tv died in a shower of green pixels on 7/10  .
a call to samsung dispatched rta , inc  .
who showed up on 7/14 and took the tv to their shop  .
i is told on 7/18 that parts had been ordered ( buffers ) and that they were still waiting for them to show up  .
followed    up again on 7/22 and is told that three boards were ordered yesterday , we'll call you when they come in  .
so , a brand new $2 , 000 tv breaks and i'm stuck chasing a third    party for almost two weeks  .
samsung may not be able to prevent every failure , but they can certainly improve the way they address a problem  .
they should just either ship me a new tv or send me back to the store for an immediate exchange .
Black levels, superb. Color, stunning. Image clarity, wow!; Power usage -- but all plasmas are going to eat energy
Accurate Color, easy operation, massive config options, next-gen processing 18 bit color.; No auto-shut off if it isn't receiving a signal.
Good calibration controls, excellent picture, good looking TV.; I'm sure it has some, but none that I can think of.
Love the colors, and the settings. Very customizable!!; Sound is OK at best.
Extremely sharp picture, great features and easy settings.; Haven't found any yet!
Best flesh tones and most accurate color matching theater viewing; Pink hue on different parts of the plasma screen
Great picture on HD channels and HD DVD, picture adjustments; Blacks are not quite on par with Pioneer Kuro
Quality Pictures one of the best that I have seen so far; There is non that I can see of so far
Superb color, clean picture quality, loads of adjustment options.; Heavy for wall mount usage. Power consumption can be a concern.
I loved this TV... great color, great sound. Everything was perfect... until it broke after 8 months.; Plasma screen cracked internally while watching it. Several others have had this problem. Samsung customer service has not been helpful in addressing the issue. See here: http://forums.cnet.com/5208-13973_102-0.html?threadID=340997
light, excellent picture and sound, looks good; After sale horror story. Awful customer service. SAMSUNG DOES NOT STAND BEHIND PRODUCTS- PERIOD. Reps lied repeatedly,claimed to escalate to next level repeatedly and did not, next level only a rubber stamp.
Outstanding color accuracy and bright picture. Outstanding glare reduction screen. Great picture in not only HD, but SD too.; Haven't found one yet.
Superb picture quality, excellent contrast ratio, great color matching, Easy set-up, reasonable price.; Unlikely, but screen burn-in a possibilty, sound quality not good.
Excellent colors straight from box. 3 easy to use presets for different lighting conditions. Beautiful picture. 3 hdmi inputs. Excellent value to cost ratio. No need to fork over another grand for a 120 hz lcd with same functionality.; Speakers for TV are not good.
Great picture, excellent price, lots of inputs and features. Menu design is easy to use.; Color bleeds.
Excellent picture. Very clear. Stunning; We experienced an audio crackling noise after owning it for 4 months. Samsung support was NO help. The crackling sound is VERY distracting and have no idea how to get this issue resolved.
The picture is absolutely stunning. Setup was basically automatic, minus the time/date settings. Decent user manual helps understanding also. HDMI is a godsend to video. The PN50A550 automatically detects the cabling configuration.; None. Setup was a breeze right out of the box. There were however a couple parts that were included that I was unable to determine what they were for.
Slim Design, Awesom Blacks, Super Energy Savings, Great Remote, Fabulous Connectivity and best colors to date; wasn't easy putting the stand on. Wish had a few more widgets, wished front control lit up
Great picture, Excellent Television; SAMSUNG ; Warranty is a joke, they will attempt to push blame to the consumer and not correct the issue.
i am still sold on plazmas over lcd's in this price range.excellent colours,fluid motion,even screen lighting and no limit of viewing angles.have owned this tv for over a month now and am thuroughly happy with it.; does not have variable volume out. i am still using an older hafler pre-amp(no remote volume control) with a seperate power amp as a 2.1 setup with a subwoofer.Of course this will not be an issue once i finally go with an av receiver.
Picture and blacks are fantastic. Easy to use remote. Lots of picture controls.; Like many plasmas, very susceptible to burn in. Also, if you've got a tv this awesome you may never want to leave your house again (up to you to decide if that is a pro or a con!)
Frame, swivel base, anti reflective, controls, easy ajustment of colors and setting, anynet connection with blu-ray, contrast, back lite remote, Bang for the bucks!. 2 years warranty, 1080p, natural colors, pc connector. Fast for sports and football.; not enought hdmi connectors, basic picture settings needs to be tweek, too thick.. reflection less effective than Pioneer and almost the sane as Panasonic.
This is by far the greatest tv that I have ever owned. Especially for the deal you can get it for now.. Reds, Blues, Greens. Menu Easy to navigate. Blu Ray looks spectacular.; Blacks are a little grainy in dark scenes.
Picture is superb, Black levels are perfect. DIsplay is really good in Standard Definition. 20-30 Picture control to fine tune your viewing quality. The black bezel is nice and shiny and goes with a good black glass stand; Sound is tinny but a Home Cinema System would resolve this. Contrast levels could have been higher, am running at almost highest level
Picture was good on digital set up with satalite tv. Took about a week before I had upgraded HDTV. When I did, oh wow! What a deference. HDTV all the way. I have whatched the show "24" and some hockey games and plasma does great!!; As I was prepaired for from other reviews,the speakers are not the best. I have attached some computer speakers throught the headphone jack and it works fine wihout having a full surrond sound setup. The speakers I have addded work great.(Phillips)
Very user friendly right out of the box and easy to setup. I'm so far very happy with this purchase.; The only thing Is that sometime the blacks are a little green.
This tv did an excellent job displaying sources I threw at it (dvd, cable, antenna, tivo). I loved the black levels, and color accuracy. I didn't feel that the antireflective screen was that bad, but maybe it was just my room.; Image retention is a major issue! After watching the Olympics for one week at maybe 2-3 hours a night, I noticed that a faint NBC peacock logo with Olympic rings was burnt into my panel. Yikes!
for the most part, the picture looks really good. 95%. HD is Dazziling when it is at its best. The color gold as shown at the Olympics was great. lots of adjustments for perfectioniasts. X-Box 360 games are excellent in sharpness and color.; ONE BIG huge one. the so called Antireflective screen. it causes light backgrounds to be pink or light purple in color!
If this TV is in your price range you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! I shopped around for about 6 months and was back and forth between a few Panasonic and Samsung Models. EXCELLENT picture does not dissapoint; None really but if I had to find one it would be the black levels not quite as deep as some of the other plasmas I looked at but this is hardly worth noting because you enjoy the beautiful picture quality otherwise too much to notice!
