Pros:. It is extremely easy to use. Followed 3 simple instructions: take it out of the package, (download itunes if you don't already have it), plug it into your computer.. 
Cons:. The earphones were not great that came with it. I am using a pair than came with a cheaper mp3 player, they fit and sound much better.. 
Summary:. I have an mp3 player that I purchased serveral years ago and and fought with it every single day that I have owned it. I have the 16 and have had no problems at all. It was very quick and easy to get it up and running. I find the menu very easy to navigate. I love the cover flow. I bought it strictly to listen to music, but have found I like watching the music videos on it. I would not recommend it if you want to watch full length movie, allthough it has the capibility, I just don't see myself watching a whole movie on that size of screen and the movie would probably use up most of the memory. If you are looking for an affordable music player it seems like this is a no brainer! I would recommend it to anyone and especially to those who want a simple easy to use, no fuss player.. 

$$;
Pros:. The new metallic shine. movies. great games. the Nike exercise system. 
Cons:. Battery life is only average. the headphones are a bit uncomfortable. 
Summary:. If you want an ipod that is easy on your eyes and wallet then i suggest this!. 

$$;
Pros:. i love the sleek and like that it isnt square and i like the glass screen the games get better and better and the video qualuty is great so fart ive have had mine for at least 2 months!. 
Cons:. battery life...and hard to find accessories for. 
Summary:. great. !!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. bigger but still sleak so you don't loose it easily more stuff on it bigger screen more colours and doesn't put a hole in your pocket and the screen does not scratch easily I can't wait to get one.. 
Cons:. you can't have many songs on it and you have to have itunes 8.. 
Summary:. It rocks I say you should get one there great trust me I'm hard to please.... 

$$;
Pros:. its shape, glass screen, wide variety of colors, great sound on the audio and video, how light it is, its interface and the cover flow ability. 
Cons:. i don't like how the screen is a fingerprint magnet and how when you play games like pac-man, its hard to control the movements.....and thats about it ^_^. 
Summary:. This ipod nano is the best i've ever seen! Its lightweight, pretty and is very entertaining. I don't know what everyone is talking about with the glare on the screen because i don't see it on mine. Even in the lightest setting outside, i can still see the screen clearly without glare. Overall, this new ipod nano is the most beautiful one yet. I love how slim it is. I personally think its better than the 2g and 3g models. Its not too hard to control the ipod when in video mode. Its actually really easy. You just have to be aware of what button you're pressing. In closing, this is a really good buy and if you don't have one yet, you should go and upgrade. ^_^. 

$$;
Pros:. I like how easy it is to find songs and that you can multi task with it and that its small and slim.. 
Cons:. I don't really like the circle thingy that controls it.. 
Summary:. Overall Its a great product, so I very much reccomend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. great shape. easy to use. lots of great features. 
Cons:. software updates. More colors please?. 
Summary:. I've had 3 iPods so far and this one is the best I've had. I love the shape. It was easy to hold and was very cute. The only problems with it I've had was all the software updating I had to do. But otherwise I love everything about this model. i hated the square version. It was ugly but it did have a good screen to watch videos on. But this one also had a good screen. And I love the new Cover flow option. It makes look for music very easy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the shape sorta like the first generation nano, It can play games and movies(terminator 2 FTW), Screen looks REALLY good.. 
Cons:. Bad battery life if you always use the backlight(without the backlight i could get a good 8 hour battery life), Screen while looks good is a fingerprint magnet, Games drain the battery in about an hour.. 
Summary:. Bottom line is it's a good product from apple and is another amazing iPod. People who's iPod freezed reset is menu and center at the same time for six seconds, The ability to play video is good for long car rides. Games suck the battery away from your iPod but are fun. I also dropped it(yes i'm a klutz)and it did not show any dents or things like that. The screen also seems scratch proof(i said SEEMS). 

$$;
Pros:. It plays music! I used to carry around my cd player, and I had to place in in my helmet while riding my bicicle. I crashed and ruined it. So I got this, this Ipod! It is great for listening to music and the radio, and I can fit it in my pocket! Wow!. 
Cons:. The words are too small. I have to wear my glasses to see it!It also has too much features. And games? Who needs games? I just want to listne to music.. 
Summary:. It is great, but the adds are all mouth and no trousers. What happened to the days when you could just press one button and hear beethoven?. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the new design not bulky like the third generation.. 
Cons:. The shake to cahnge song stops working correctly and changes very strangely. 
Summary:. Good to Slap them 510 bay songs. 

$$;
Pros:. Music - Movies - TV Shows - Podcasts. Big, Bright Screen. Thin, Sleek Design. Genius: A Great Idea, Fun to Use. New Software Update Fixes Coverflow Flaw. 
Cons:. None Really, Just a Wish List. Touch Screen. Genius: Work Like Pandora. A Little Shorter Design. 
Summary:. This is my first ipod but not my first musical gadget. I am a gadget maven, I really love my electronics. Just about everything I own plays mp3s.. So ,why did I finally break down and buy an IPOD? For all the other gadgets I can get for it, of course!. Why did I choose THIS IPOD? 16 Gigs, sleek thin design, music, movies, tv, podcasts in this little thing, I am WOWED!. The one real drawback for me was that you couldn't turn off coverflow. If my IPOD was in my armband and I wanted to turn up the volume the coverflow would be flipping a million miles an hour but the sound stayed the same. With the new software update 1.0.3 you can turn off coverflow and solve that problem.. I am really loving my new IPOD and now I'm going to ask Santa for the Bose speaker system, the Sony CD clock radio, and let's see...what else do I need.... 

$$;
Pros:. You can now have games on this iPod, which is fun for traveling. The tilt screen is just fun to play with, nothing special. I love the motion sensor for shuffling! And the bigger screen sure is pretty.. 
Cons:. I've noticed that the battery life is EXTREMELY short. Its almost not worth buying because of this.. 
Summary:. I've had my iPod for 2 days and I'm loving it, but I would say its just as cool as the other iPods. I like how thin it is but that just makes it more susceptible to getting lost because it weighs so little. I'm really dissapointed in the battery life. After playing a game for a mere 10 minutes the battery life turns red. After fully charging the ipod and then turning it on and scrolling through my music I noticed about a 1/4 notch dissapeared from the battery!. 

$$;
Pros:. It's good, stable.. &lt;a href="http://www.sportsstatsblog.com/"&gt;Sports Blog&lt;/a&gt;. 
Cons:. well expected more than which it has!. &lt;a href="http://www.sportsstatsblog.com/"&gt;Sports Blog&lt;/a&gt;. 
Summary:. over all it's a good product!. well expected more than which it has!. regards. Adi. &lt;a href="http://www.sportsstatsblog.com/"&gt;Sports Blog&lt;/a&gt;. 

$$;
Pros:. like the return to the 2nd generation size and shape. 
Cons:. charging with the Bose Sound Dock is not supported. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the menu features, font size option, smaller unit is nice. 
Cons:. The 4th generation nano will not charge in a docking station. I get the screen message "Charging is not supported with this accessory". Thats a big inconvenience for me. Battery life seems to be shorter than earlier versions. 
Summary:. Overall I miss my Gen 3 which I misplaced. It was nice to listen to music while charging in docking station. This isn't possible with this version. 

$$;
Pros:. It has some neat features and the color and size i love. 
Cons:. The battery sucks and it's very hard to understand with the i tune 8 just to complicated and it froze a day after i had it and had to take it back for another one to much money for to many problems and not enough quality. 
Summary:. I like it cause it does have nice features but needs some fixin. 

$$;
Pros:. Larger memory. Color screen. Tilt screen.. 
Cons:. NO other chargers are compatible, or available! Noticebly shorter battery life.. 
Summary:. It was not a problem for me to install the new iTunes. But I do not like the info required for the genuis feature...so I do not use it. I HATE that no other chargers are compatible with this generation, making all my other accessories useless! Did not have much of a learning curve in using the new product, although I still can't seem to master the shake feature.. 

$$;
Pros:. Interface and graphics looks better.. Full aluminium casing (won't scratch easy like chrome backing on 3rd gen Nano). 
Cons:. The Shape. Curved shiny display makes it hard to see in light conditions.. 
Summary:. All though the 4th gen Nano comes in a whopping 16gb, a full anodised body and a few extra funky features I still prefer the 3rd gen shape. Why, because you dont need to turn the screen around to view a movie. Also the "short and fat" design felt more comfortable and less suseptible to damage when carrying the Nano in a tight jeans pocket or on the optional shoulder strap. I think the 3rd gen Nano shape with 16gb capacity and full anodised colour aluminium casing would have been perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the slenderness, lightness, color, interface, and the video. That's why I got the Nano in the first place. It's great overall.. 
Cons:. Now to why this is a 2.5 stars. I have an AC adapter/car charger and Bose Speaker Dock for my 2006 80 GB iPod and 2005 iPod mini. Both accessories CANNOT charge my new iPod Nano!!!. 
Summary:. Overall, it's great. But if you get this iPod, plan on replacing the other accessories too! So it will cost you a pretty penny.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good audio quality, bright screen, lightweight. 
Cons:. Short battery life, the circle can be hard to deal with, support for only iTunes. 
Summary:. I've been using this Nano for over a year now, and I'm really starting to get sick of it.. The audio quality is fine, provided you upgrade from the headphones that come with the Nano. The screen is large and bright, but attracts fingerprints if I'm grabbing it. The battery life only lasts longer than four or five hours if I make the backlight turn off within five seconds of not touching it. The motion sensors are annoying when I need to run, but can be turned off. The circle's sensitivity is off, leaving me to either not move the cursor at all or to skip two songs ahead from what I intended. The fact that Apple only allows support with iTunes to transfer music onto the device is a hassle, as I use WMP to listen to all of my music on the PC, and I only buy CDs (No digital distribution).. If you want to be trendy and hop on the Apple bandwagon, I suppose you can spend your money on this, but you can probably find a nicer product that actually has BUTTONS and a battery that can last entire trips elsewhere.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightweight, small. 
Cons:. After a week my scroll button did not work properly. An image has been burned into the screen. I do not like this ipod near as much as my previous mini.. 
Summary:. I would not waste my money on this ipod.. Updated. on Aug 27, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. None - previous generations are better. 
Cons:. Software freezes, menu dial doesn't rotate smoothly, not compatible with my existing docking/transmitter devices. 
Summary:. Device software has frozen twice in last four months; Menu wheel doesn't rotate as smoothly as previous generations; Not compatible with my Bose docking station (purchased only 6 months ago) or my FM radio transmitter (purchased 2 years ago). I also find the tilt sensitivity to be down right annoying -- I'll be listening to a song and if I move my iPod the wrong way, it automatically skips to another random song.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, light, high capacity. 
Cons:. Poor design. Dial is too sensitive. Any little touch turns on the unit, even if it is in your pocket, and before you know it, the unit is out of power. Also volume control is too sensitive.. 
Summary:. Poor design. Dial is too sensitive. Any little touch turns on the unit, even if it is in your pocket, and before you know it, the unit is out of power. Also volume control is too sensitive.. 

$$;
Pros:. the fact that its able to play video is good, also, the large screen is nce.. 
Cons:. AWFUL BATTERY LIFE!!!!!!! It only holds about 4 hours of charge. 
Summary:. Just dont get it if you will use it for things that force you to be far away from so sort of charger!. 

$$;
Pros:. Holds a lot.. 
Cons:. Does not charge in Bose sound dock nor when attached to FM transmitter in car. So it's always going to be dead if used constantly.. 
Summary:. You want to use the product to listen to your music wherever you are. This nano is not compatible to accept a charge.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love that it has the shake feature. Love the green color.. 
Cons:. It sure didn't break in half, but the screen fell off. Then, the backlight of the screen went out.. 
Summary:. it's crappy!. 

$$;
Pros:. nonneeeeeee. 
Cons:. Only average sound quality, no mirror on the back, terrible battery life, poor design, screen too small to watch movies, too sensitive, click wheel fails in rainy conditions, and other flaws.. 
Summary:. Eurghhhhh...
