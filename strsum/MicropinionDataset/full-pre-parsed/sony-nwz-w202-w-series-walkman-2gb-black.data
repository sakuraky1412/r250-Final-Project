its pretty gd  .

i used these jogging and when i train aquarunning in the pool  .

they are super    light , have good battery life and very good sound  .

but they also make a perfect mp3 player to throw in the bag for short trips or commuting  .

excellent build quality too .

one thing i don't get is people saying things like it does not have a screen neither does nano , i mean it's only 2 gbs  .

my biggest problem with any mp3 has been the bloody cords  .

sony nwz    w202 is the cure  .

this may be my favorite mp3 player of all time  .

i've broken nearly all of my earlier electronics , so having a player this cheap is great  .

the sound quality is surprisingly good , but there is not much bass , but thats probably because i cannot get a good seal i also think its suprisingly cool looking fyi i found mine at my local target on clearance , and i've seen them on clearance for other targets .

by far the best little electronnic device i bought/own .

i have had this for about a week now , and its every bit as awesome as i expected it to be  .

lightweight , easy to use    is anyone else sick of armbands  .

headphones that did not stay in  .

this thing rocks and is my favorite purchase of the year  .

seriously , it rocks  .

if you run or exercise to music , get this .

sony has created an amazing product that they should do more to capitalize on  .

the device is sleek , solidly built , with great attention to detail  .

i especially love the way the two sides snap together and turns off in respond the zappin feature is surprisingly well    implemented  .

annoucements of zappin in , zappin out and sound effects enhances the experience and makes sure you feel in control  .

compared to apple's speaking shuffle solution , this solution is much simpler and works much better in practice  .

it is so much easier to recognize a song by hearing it compared to listening to a robot say its title some reviewers have the cheek to complain there's no display  .

that's precisely the point of this player  .

it's meant to be worn on the head  .

this player is about how to solve the problem of headphone cords and still providing a reasonable interface .

is so tired of the cords on headphones  .

now i am free  .

you will not be disappointed  .

sony scores big with this unit  .

i have various ipods , but this is fantastic  .

no muss , no fuss  .

downloads are simple and quick  .

once in your ears , comfortable and no movement  .

they stay put  .

buy and you will will put your ipod away .

disagree with not sweat proof reviews  .

worn correctly (natural not complicated) the set fits great and i don't see how it can fall off  .

vigorous cardio+weights on hottest seattle day ever (104f/40c)    no problem  .

sound quality a+ agree the usb port should be rubberised but it hasn't caused me a problem  .

blue    tak could fix this for current owners  .

i would love a delete button    then you can upload all the songs you want and delete the ones you do not .

i recently bought this , its just goes inot your ears , no wires , no hassels fit while driving , in gym , while playing with my kid  .

perfect fit for me  .

memory is 2 gb ( its available in 4 gb as well) sufficient to store mp3's  .

zappin function to hear shuffle music  .

its gives 4 sec playback of all songs , i can easily select te song  .

3 min charge and 90 min playback is there  .

its hassel free , time saving entertainment .

there's nothing else better that this out there  .

if you work out and are tired of your headphones falling out or getting tangled get these  .

if these can handle sweat , rain , and general moisture effectively then sony just hit a home run  .

i like it and wear it all day without discomfort  .

a content transfer program comes with the player which makes it easy to drag from itunes and drop into the player  .

i listen to podcasts .

probably the best sport    friendly mp3 player out there  .

waiting for third    party protect case and firmware upgrade .

i just got this a few days ago and i will never go back to wired this are going to start a new generation of mp3headphone combinations i just hope sony markets them right cause if they did they could change the market or at least grab a big chuck of it these work perfect for anyone whos actime i've been mountain bike riding and wieght lifting and there perfect they never shift or move at all and the sound is always so clear and loud  .

i dont ever miss the whole screen thing no more casue its not needed when you working out the jog dail is really usefull for skipping tracks and the zappin feature is not that bad after you get use to it  .

i recomend these to anyone who wants something to work out with or just dosnt want to deal with earbuds no more i would say this thing is well worth the money even is the storage is limited a bit  .

plus at least it has controls you can use unlike the new ipod i think its a waste of money and i should know i retured it with in the first week of owning it .

i don't know about the sweaty guy or the water resistance or lack there of  .

it does not really have the look of a device that is meant for the hard core exercisers  .

its great to wear around when you want your hands free to do things  .

its got a decent amount of on board memory and the battery life is ok too .

i purchased this product about 2 months ago  .

i am relieved that it is working fine till now  .

many people have experienced problems with this player , mainly because it is not waterproof  .

sony has looked into this problem and is providing free service to those who have experienced problems related to sweat  .

if you are having a similar problem related to sweat then you can go to the nearest sony service centre and get your walkman repaired for free  .

for more details , visit the official site of sony now about this device , i love the unique design which is the only reason why i purchased it  .

sound quality is relative  .

the player is able to pump out smooth highs and clear mids  .

but bass is unimpressive  .

it is tight but lacks punch if you listen accoustic pop , electronica , trance , bollywood pop then you will love the sound quality  .

but if listen hip    hop , hard rock or normal pop you will be disaapointed because of its bass  .

overall , the sound quality is good for casual listeners  .

but if you are a audio purist look somewhere else  .

honestly , i listen to my sony 5  .

1 home theatre (rs 50 , 000)and in comparison to that the player just sounds faded .

if the ear pieces would consistently seal , this would have been a great device  .

but because of the design and also when doing active exercising , the seal is always broken and the sound quality nose dives updated  .

on sep 14 , 2010  .

i really wanted to like this player  .

really , i did  .

as soon as i saw it is available i bought it  .

i is a little nervous that it would not fit into my ear canals as i have tiny ears and it would not be the first time ear buds did not fit  .

but alas , the product came and they fit  .

they actually felt great  .

i'm not going to talk much about the mp3 features    everything is fine or up to the level i expected  .

the zappin in feature is awesome  .

i think the jog dial could be a little more sensitive so you don't have to spin it so hard to change the song then i brought it to the gym  .

it works great the first five minutes , but after you start sweating the ear buds will fall out  .

i tried everything  .

i switched the ear bud sizes , i even covered them with foam pieces from other earbuds to absorb the sweat they do not stay in place  .

which is sad , considering this is where the product is marketed    to gym users so unless you do not sweat , i would stay away from this product anyway , i decided to give this mp3 player away to my father since i already own other mp3 players  .

good idea , bad execution  .

if they could fix this i would be head over heels for this mp3 player .

this product , with all its beauty , is useless  .

i've been trying to get my 5k rupees back since two weeks now  .

the player conked out because sweat entered the system through the mini usb port  .

the service centre employees actually told me not to use it for workout or jogging the wheel on the thing is called jog dial , for crying out loud  .

sony is misleading people by saying it has produced a player for workout since this aint it  .

i am deeply disappointed with this purchase and strongly recommend people to buy something else if they want to listen to music while running they have used the excuse of a workout player for many drawbacks    .

no playlist support ,  .

only 2gb of space ,  .

no screen ,  .

no seeking in songs ,  .

no 3  .

5 mm jack and hence , no direct output to speakers to listen to music on some other speaker system i'd have pardoned all these drawbacks    had it really been a workout player  .

its not  .

now these drawbacks are really looming large .

if your a serious gym user i  .

you do it properly and work up a sweat then dont even consider this product  .

if you go there to chat , then its fine but then there are far cheaper products that can serve this puprose oh dear , sony    youve really shot yousely in the foot with this one .

if you  .

re ready to give a try what this new product all about , go ahead  .

in case you  .

re looking for a typical , simple mp3 player easy data transfer and without solving puzzles when you use the mp3 player look some other model/brand  .

nwz202 is not for you .

just don''t sweat on it  .

the charge connection is open and vulnerable to sweat  .

funny for a piece that is advertised for working out with  .

it seems real sensitive to that  .

they need to put a plug over that port  .

the design is great , but consistent performance needs to be more hardy  .

sometimes in the cradle , it doesn't take a charge  .

sometimes it loses battery life very quickly  .

i think the 12 hr time is all the time it's off the charger , not just operating time  .

make sure you charge it before each use , and do not get sweat on it .

cons cont    .

earpieces lay across your face    not suitable to use during any activity that causes you to sweat  .

i am a huge fan of sony , so this poor review is hard to write  .

in my opinion , this product is not thought through , or tested properly before being released  .

all the reviews referring to problems with sweat and malfunction are accurate  .

my unit completely died on my third work    out  .

i is running for 27 minutes , when all the sudden the unit said , zappin , which i did not activate  .

it started playing the short clips of songs , the jog dial stopped responding completely , and now the unit will not work at all ; not even light or respond on the docking station i would recommend this product for someone to use on a plane , while gardening , working around the house etc , any activity that will not make you work up a sweat  .

it is absolutely not suitable for more active applications  .

there are other design improvements i wish they incorporated , but i'll worry about that when a reliable product is released .

i got these for my wife who is a runner , and initially she loved them  .

she had previously been using her palm treo 755p with a motorola s9 stereo bluetooth headset , but she never really liked the fit of the motorola headset , and she hated carrying her phone , and lastly , probably more the phone's problem , but the stereo bluetooth connection is unreliable at best  .

i saw these on first look from ces , and knew i had her solution  .

i waited and waited for them to come out , they were taking a while to show up on amazon  .

com , but i saw them one day in a target (for only $55 i might add)  .

well i snapped them up right then and there (they were the last pair)  .

got them home  .

put some of my wife's music on them , and she is off to the races  .

well , needless to say , they didn't last long  .

after a few weeks , i noticed rust forming around the magnet part that holds the unit together when it is charging , as well as mineral deposits (or perhaps sunscreen) in the mini    usb connector  .

i told her that i had seen a few complaints about sweat , and to make sure to keep them clean after she ran  .

well , she went to use them later that day , and they were dead  .

i reset them , and is able to get them to turn ot , but no luck getting them to charge or even recognize on the usb dock  .

moreover , the unit got very warm when i attempted to charge it  .

worst of all , i had bought them with a gift card , and cannot find the recipt , so i guess i am just out that $55  .

i am really tempted to get another pair , but this time from amazon , but i think i might wait untill the palm pre comes out and try going back to the old solution of the bluetooth headphones the other wank (minor in comparison to the sweat issue) is that there is no playlist support  .

they could have put in a tiny led display just to select a playlist , say before a run  .

i would have prefered this feature by leaps and bounds over the zappin' feature , which i did not fine very useful  .

ok , rant over .

m highly disappointed with this product  .

the whole idea of working out without hassling with wires made me want this mp3 player since it is announced a while back at ces  .

couldn  .

t wait for it to hit stores , so i ordered from the sonystyle store  .

when i finally got it , i went to the gym and after jogging for 30 minutes with it , the controls become irresponsive  .

volume maxes out and it didn  .

t lower if i pressed it  .

can  .

t skip songs nor get zappin to work  .

i am so pissed off that a product like this that it will be used by people for working out can  .

t get sweat on it  .

i guess the testing team is a bunch of nerds who just tested it jumping or walking around their cubicles for about 2 minutes if you are thinking of buying this and you are planning on using it to run or for working out , i would advise you to wait and see if sony can address this big issue  .

if you workout without sweating , then go ahead  .

i guess that  .

s the way sony thinks people do exercise , without sweating .

this , like the 3rd gen ipod shuffle , is a waste of money for joggers as both devices completely fail after being exposed to sweat  .

a waste of money if you intention is to use them for exercise .

pros    zappin , sound is good , light weight design , the led decorative light is pretty , pretty looking mp3 in general , love the docking stand , reminds me of a holoband used in caprica cons    un    reliable , freezes up in the middle of songs or before using it , no playlist function , lack of general support from sony , memory could use a couple of extra gb buy at own risk .

the fatal flaw with this product is its total lack of ability to cope with sweat  .

this is inexcusable given that it is initially advertised (at least in my gym) as a way to work out without the inconvenience of wires  .

i notice that sony has since (quietly) declared it unsuitable for this purpose   not good enough i'm afraid because that is the sole reason for my purchase  .

mine lasted about 6 weeks incidentally , which seems to actually be above average in terms of life span sony need to address this pronto or risk losing its long    standing reputation for reliability and quality control  .

i have been buying sony products since the very first walkmans of the early 80s , but recently the company seems to have lost its way , particularly in its focus on the customer  .

i will be demanding my money back and looking elsewhere for a conventional mp3 player .

i got a refund and went and bought a new one from a different retailer in the hope it is the batch and this one came with a note saying it was not sweat resistant sony that is a weak cop out and crap  .

is that the action you took to ensure the units would not fail adding paperwork stating not to use it near sweat  .

i'm taking this one back unused because i require to work out with my player  .

very sloppy work sony .

do not buy it for its purpose , use it while lazing around only  .

and strictly not for sports , i just wasted 60gbp in 2 months of using this rubbish mp3 player from sony  .

i wonder did they ever do any testing on its parts against sweat  .

not too much to ask is not it  .

i returned the first one because it just stopped working  .

i am now on a second unit and it is doing the same thing  .

moisture has caused the forward song dial to stop working and now it won't accept a charge definitely do not purchase this if you do any exercise .

do not buy it  .

do not buy this usless product , i would thought sony is better than this  .

worst product i ever buy in my life  .

you cannot used them in summer if you sweat a lot , and for sure cannot used in the gym , the sweat will kill it  .

they will ask you to pay for the repair even when i is told that this is design so i can go running with it  .

and they ask me to pay for the repair .

after my purchase , i came to know that sony walkman w202 is facing many problems due to sweat and the company has put a notice of changing the same from the service centers  .

my first concern is why , a brand like sony would manufacture such a faulty product , which is meant to be used during activities like gym , sports and other stuffs  .

after 3 days of purchase , i found the piece to be dead  .

not charging , not being recognosed by pc , keys not functionink , became warm when the connection is on , i have taken it to the company , they replaced the piece , but , again the similar thing is happening with the changed piece  .

this is not at all expected from a company like sony  .

i think since i have waisted my 5 k for this piece of crap , i would never go for sony again in my life  .

pathetic product of a pathetic brand with pathetic service  .

shame on them .

i would recommend waiting to buy this product until sony issues a corrected version that is not a failure in the field .

the concept from sony is great  .

i am a sony fan and is waiting to get my hands on this  .

but is totally disappointed after first use first of all , not a lot of features for playing music , but that's ok for the size i used this in the gym for a couple of hours and my workouts are pretty intense  .

i did about 45 min of cardio and then weightlifting first off , my ears started hurting since the buds did not fit in well next the player just died the next day  .

it just did not start up and refused to work  .

not happy  .

i do sweat a lot (and who dosent in an intense cardio session) and maybe thats got something to do with this  .

i feel robbed  .

i am going to turn this in and get a replacement of something else .

i've now spent two hours on the phone trying to get a reasonable response from sony regarding expedited replacement of my second nwz    w202  .

i is told by their tech support that these are being returned by the dozen  .

my intuition is that the open mini    usb port on the headset allows sweat to wick into the unit not a very slick design element for something specifically designed for the gym  .

please heed my advice    this is a no go .
