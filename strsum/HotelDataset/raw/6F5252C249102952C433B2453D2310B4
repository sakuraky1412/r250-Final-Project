3 years ago by chance we popped in for a meal , it was absolutely excellent even if expensive , so when an advert came through it triggered my memory and decided a good time to visit it again and to walk on the chilterns and combine it with national trust properties , previously we had concentrated on the sites of windsor .
the hotel has a good car park and is about a 10 min walk from maidenhead station .
so what was not quite right , the food was expensive , but although nothing wrong with it i do not think it warranted the price tag .
the volume of food was larger , but then it was too much to try all the courses .
also the menu did not always reflect what ended up on your plate .
breakfast was very good on the saturday and sunday , freshly cooked , but on monday it seemed they were running out of fresh food our first room seemed fine until we tried to turn on the tv. .
it was not the set which was faulty but the aerial socket .
no problem we were given another room , but i do not think the room should have been let in the first place .
the second room was bigger , but not such a good shower the pool is mainly out side and was too cold to use as the pump had broken .
we were not told about this .
the tropical shower was not . . .
