501 is very quiet as it is the only room on that side of the hotel ; has a view back up the slope behind the hotel but not down over the front , but as we were n't there much when it was daytime this did not bother us .
we ate twice in the `` les enfants terrible '' restaurant which the hotel probably should advertise a bit more ; the food was excellent and an allowance of 60euro per head if on half board pretty much covered eating in here .
ditto having to spend over 100 euro to park in the hotel for the week seemed a bit steep on top of what we were paying to stay there .
now the only negative ; even by apls prices , the drinks are a rip off ; 37 euro for a glass of prosecco and a gin and tonic ?
ski hire in the hotels own hire place matched the drinks sadly - i dont mind a small premium for the ease - but waling 100m got my skis at sport 2000 for 80 euro rather than the hotel price over more than 200 . . .
spa is nice if slightly over-run by noisy and badly behaved children ; more of an issue the world over than a fault of the hotel .
a few too many people with too much money pay it but i cant help feeling the bar would be busier if the prices wee more sensible .
we just felt the price of drinks and incidentals got silly very quickly and took the edge off it .
overall we loved the hotel , ski in ski out , the room and the staff .
the staff were all incredibly helpful , and nothing was too much trouble .
