all gps systems will get you where you want to go , well most anyway  .

i use a gps everyday to find between 5    8 addresses each day  .

i used a garmin and a mio in the passed but i used a magellan 3100 whitch is a friends and had no problems with it at all  .

it's also the reason i bought a gps to begin with but i bought a garmin  .

i had some problems including the first didn't work at all  .

i'ts just that i've had no problems  .

i program in all my addresses and just continue even if i detour for coffee or any store i may need and then back to my route  .

it saves me 2 hours in just getting to and from mystops  .

i work in manhattan and have had problems with both garmin and mio losing the signal and left me rerouting over and over , sometimes just turning it off  .

the magellan maestro 4250 is by far my favorite  .

the only reason i might change is if the newer magellan has some features that i like  .

but i do not plan on that for a few years at least .

i read plenty of reviews before buying this system  .

most of them were not good but i took the chance i am telling you all who did not like this system you are missing on a great one from the beggining this thing turned on perfectly  .

the blutooth with my razor phone is great and clear , and the voice command has not failed me i love this toy did i mentioned that i bought it refurbished at overstock  .

com  .

pay no attention to other reviews they do not know what they are talking about , probably they were paid by the competition  .

i returned a garmin 650 and purchased a magellan 4050  .

when i opened the box it had a frozen screen , i called cs and they sent up a 4250 [upgrade from the 4050] free exchange  .

i have not used all the features but what i did use are top notch .

i purchased this device for a cross    country rv road trip this past july (2008)  .

i traveled one way from washington dc to california ; going through the south to new orleans , then north to st  .

louis and on to mt  .

rushmore , then west to home via yellowstone and salt lake city  .

all told , we drove 5 , 600 miles in 15 days and crossed 16 states  .

the magellan 4250 operated near flawlessly  .

the only recommendation i would make before taking a trip like this is to purchase a cheap atlas from walmart ($7  .

99) or some other store  .

the reason for this is simple , you cant use the gps to plan your next routes if youre using it to drive at the same time  .

i looked at a lot of gps units in stores (circuit city , best buy , costco , etc  .

) and a ton of reviews before purchasing this one  .

while some of the reviews were unfavorable , i found this device to be a perfect mix of everything i is looking for   text to speech navigation instructions , easy to read maps and an affordable price ($299 at circuit city  .

for $900 i expect the device to drive the car for me  .

the integrated aaa information is also very helpful in finding campsites and kid friendly attractions in small cities/towns  .

i bought mine at circuit city as a precaution as many reviews here complained about the device dying at inopportune moments  .

circuit city assured me i could return it at any of their locations nationwide with a receipt  .

i knocked $75 off the price by pointing out that costco  .

com sold the same device for $299 and circuit city price matched it for me the text to speech (the voice announcing the street name) is a must as fiddling with a display screen while driving a 32 foot rv would have been hazardous to everyones health  .

the magellans voice prompts were loud , clear and well in advance ; 2 miles before the turn you are prompted that the turn is coming and in which direction , a half mile ahead of the turn you are reminded of the turn and at the turn itself you are guided via another prompt and a two    tone note (left , right and straight prompts all have different tones)  .

while this can seem a little overbearing , you get used to it and eventually begin to drive without looking at the gps  .

the automatic night mode is a nice feature that kicks in when the light level drops , saving you from having to play with the device while driving  .

the maps are very accurate , at one point during the trip we got caught in a massive lighting and rain storm in iowa at 10pm  .

the lighting flashes were completely blinding and rain is coming down so hard , it looked and felt like a fire hose is being let loose on the windshield  .

we couldnt see a thing , not even the road , and followed the gps display through the storm without fail i only had three issues with the magellan during the trip   1) twice the device took me to a phantom location as the poi wasnt updated or is wrong  .

the first time it took me to a walmart in virgina that didnt exist , it is an office building  .

the second time is a restaurant in wyoming that did exist but is at another location  .

the phone number is correct , the address wasnt  .

2) from time to time the magellan would get out of slightly out of gps sync and would call a location address a half block before the actual destination is reached  .

this only occurred a handful of times  .

3) the voice commands can be a little sensitive and an rv full of noisy children can , on occasion , send the screen to the say a command screen  .

murphys law ensures that this will happen just as you need to make a series of turns or are coming to your destination and didnt catch the address  .

unfortunately , you have to press an arrow on the screen to go back , which can be tough when turning or doing something you need both hands for all told , i would highly recommend this device to anyone looking for a great gps unit .

i had to rate this unit a 9 , not because i think this is the worlds greatest gps  .

but because it is not as bad as everyone says i have read many of the negative reviews and would like to respond #1 someone mentioned no manual    this person clearly did not used the cd or go on the manufacturer website  .

there are full instructions on how to use the bluetooth #2 bluetooth sucks    i have an apple iphone , and yes the bluetooth is lame , but so far , mine does work with it #3 freezing    download the latest firmware and install it  .

most here probably do not have the skills to do this #4 low volume    i thought the volume is pretty high , i had to lower the level from max to half  .

it is pretty loud even at that level that is all i tested so far  .

i tested these first because of all the negative reviews  .

again , this is not the greatest gps product but for what i paid , it works well updated  .

on feb 1 , 2009  .

the customer support is the worst i ever knew  .

i spent hours on hold on the phone and i had to call 8 times to get an exchange with their trade    in program  .

then , i is supposed to be charged $305  .

00 , and they charged me $433  .

99 buy a garmin  .

i researched various gps before deciding on this one  .

i have never used a portable gps systen before only my wifes built in her cadillac  .

i found this portable to be as good if not better than her built in system  .

i would definetly buy it again .

the good   beautiful screen  .

you can operate some functions with voice commands , which work well and are very easy  .

it features text    to    speech functionality , integrated bluetooth which i will not need (i dont want my gps to be my phone , pda , tv remote , ipod , etc) , and traffic capabilities using the same fm system as others available (which work , but are far from perfect at this point)  .

the system provided accurate directions , as expected and seen in the past when using the hertz rental car magellan systems  .

the maps are the same for the areas i reviewed in fl , ny , and ca as seen with garmins  .

this is no surprise since they use the same map supplier (navteq) the bad   voice control does not include address entry  .

mount is a little big for my taste the bottom line   beautiful screen and very easy to use  .

if you are familiar with the unit in the hertz cars and liked it , this fits like a glove as it works identical  .

at the costco price of $249  .

00 (with a $100  .

00 off coupon for 2008 march 17th    23rd) , this unit is awesome and does everything and more that i would want from a portable gps  .

buy with your amex and get additional 1yr warranty free  .

this is by far the best gps in it's class  .

it features more than the competition at the same price  .

offers voice activated controls that works great in the car  .

aaa info make poi's far better to use , gives you info on store hours , ratings of restuarants , price of admitions , describes cusine  .

only 2 downfalls one is that unlike other gps units this will not transfer you phones contacts you must put them in manually , and two it will not tell you which side of the street your destination is , once you arrive , but unlike garmin units you can input multiple destinations and plan an itenary and also offers better detour options  .

take it from a former garmin and tomtom owner this is the way to go .

third such device and this one seems to have it right  .

points of interest need to be updated on a sd card not supplied  .

i log over several hours behind wheel and the routing for this has yet to be wrong  .

bluetooth works well  .

the speakerphone sounds great for hands free calling and the feedback i've received on the microphone clarity has been very good  .

screen is crisp and size is just right  .

highly recommended  .

experimented with tom tom one , magellan 4000 , mio and lowrance 500  .

this equals or exceeds any gps unit out there  .

the voice command is fun and the text to street direction is excellant  .

from turn on no waiting for the unit to locate a signal  .

bright and clear screen  .

the voice command keeps you coming back for more the only thing missing is phone voice command  .

for those looking consider nothing less than a 4 or larger screen  .

it has everything  .

when i saw the negative comments i is a little skeptical but i have really enjoyed it so far  .

it can have a delayed reaction sometimes when touching some icons  .

but it does not happen all the time  .

i really like the feature on the map page where it allows you to see your speed while driving and what city you currently are in and zip code  .

overall , it seems to have everything i is looking for .

the maestro 4250 is a very nice well put together gps for the road  .

i have owned gps units for my small business since the first garmin units were out  .

this unit really is set up well for the traveler with it's aaa info and reliability for good directions  .

this unit gives you the option to choose if you want the most direct route , fastest time , use freeways only , or other options  .

yes your first choice may not be the directions you would choose but after choosing another option you will find the one you want  .

(picky people out there)i really think that most early reviews are made without knowing the system first  .

i have not had to call support but it sounds like it is dismal  .

come on magellan  .

hire americans  .

i did use the internet for help especially the magellan site  .

the only thing that i did not like is that the system has no support for storing your own way points  .

you can store addresses but in my business i need to store agricultural fields with no addresses  .

no big deal for the normal user  .

one other great use for these gps systems is in the fog  .

we have tule fog here and you can see the roads before you get to them  .

big help  .

i reviewed all the top products that garmin , tom tom , and a few other companies put out and this one caught my eye  .

first off , the wide screen is great and very clear  .

the menu is very easy to navigate through and it only takes a few minutes to setup even without reading the manual i read a lot of reviews about the blue tooth options on several other units and i is not expecting much but the bluetooth worked on my sprint treo perfectly and the listener on the other end had no problems hearing me the one feature that stands out is the aaa reviews of restaurants , hotels , etc  .

depending on the poi you choose , you can find out a little about that location including telephone and hours of business those are just two options but what most people are looking for is a easy to use gps so far , this is very good  .

you type in the address (it may complete it or give you options as you type) and choose which way you want to go (fastest , shortest , etc  .

) and off you go  .

you can alter your route on screen real easily and the map even gives you the option of a split screen when you come up to turns you can adjust the volume right on the screen and the graphics are very clear while at the store i debated on the tom tom but had a hard time navigating through the screens and it would never pull up the sats i do understand we are in the store but the others pulled up the sats perfectly the other option that this unit has is voice commands  .

this is so easy to use and it gives you another option in changing routes or finding a destination while on the fly it is under $500 so it is not cheap but if you are lookng for a quality gps with options that actually work , this is a good choice .

i have run into a problem with the world of portable gps devices  .

here is my problem and hopefully there is a manufacturer with a solution  .

i recently bought the magellan maestro 4250 gps unit and most of what i came to expect has been great  .

the problem is maybe unique to my job which is service warranty work in the manufactured home business  .

in this industry i travel in many different states and often to addresss that are not current in the gps system or addresses that are not listed on my work order as a valid address  .

example &  .

imagine entering an address into your gps by city then street and the street is not being found  .

example   i had an address in va where the street is listed as rt 1 box 332 and when entering it into the gps i get stopped on the street name because there are never names as route 1  .

i call the home owners and they give me directions to where there home is  .

still i am not able to tell my gps system where they are because i still do not have a valid address to type into the gps unit  .

yes i can manually move my finger along the screen until i locate it  .

but that is unbelievably time consuming and almost impossible to view where you are on the map because you do not get a great overview paper map style look  .

like tunnel vision trying to move your finger down a map until you are where you think you need to be  .

makes the portable gps not near as useful for me in the past i have used microsoft streets and maps software on my laptop with the gps receiver plugged into the usb port of the pc  .

when getting directions from the home owner i use this software on my computer with a mouse and follow their directions until i am within a block or two  .

then i save that point on the map and when i go to drive to the point i use the laptop in my car and it navigates me right to where i need to go  .

but the laptop software and gps capabilities are not near as accurate as a portable in car system  .

so the problem is that i cannot leave for a trip and spend the time to place 10    15 destinations manually into my portable gps maneuvering to each one using my finger  .

remember the addresses i receive are not always found because i get not so normal locations  .

street addresses versus all of these route and box numbers galore  .

so what i need is garmin , magellan , or some other manufacturer to included software that i can use on my pc to map out and better navigate to the location  .

then save all of my points and transport them via sd or usb card to the portable car unit and upload my points  .

does anyone know of anything like that currently out there in the market  .

the only problems i have been having with it is that for some reason , it can not say the number 3  .

wanted to upgrade from tomtom1 to get street names announce feature  .

returned the garmin 360 when i realized the great price is due to it recently being discontinued by garmin  .

also didn't like the fact that i had to type in the city every time i used it , no memory of prior cities  .

tried and returned a garmin 205 after it locked up after 1 days use , and would not unlock  .

picked the magellan based on features  .

almost didn't buy it as big box stores had few magellan options is thinking this might indicate they are not favored for whatever reason having used it extensively for about 3 weeks , with 2 long trips , and house hunting in a new city , like it way better than the garmin , but think the tomtom user interface is better  .

did not buy a tomtom with more features because it's maps and pois were way out of date despite having the latest they offer .

with the same trip set up , magellan has accurately shorten my trip in 5 miles comparing with tom tom 920 and garmin 760  .

both tom tom and garmin kept asked me to reroute toward the longer travel mileages and prolong my travel time at least 20 minutes more than magellan  .

in magellan , you can choose more freeway or less freeway travel , but garmin and tom tom only let you choose fastest time or shortest distance  .

however , both of them route you to travel longer time and longer distance comparing with magellan .

looked at all the gps and found the 4250 is the best to nav  .

have a old phone and is very easy to syc with the unit  .

the voice command is very good graphics are the best i seen on any gps  .

only one to come close is the lg got this unit on ebay for 250  .

00 best buy is 400 plus tax .

i have owned many magellan gps' from the bag unit similar to the hertz' never lost to the 4250 this is a great unit  .

i do not understand the negative reviews  .

the only negative is the magellan support if you have to call    they are poor in this area .

the magellan products have been very useful for me  .

i started with a road mate 850 , which is good in its' own right , but the maestro 4250 has done a great job of getting rid of the applications you do not use , and adding features that are very useful and easy to use the fact that there is no need to spend time developing the voice recognition is great  .

having this tool for hands free operation is great , but i would like to see more points of interest built into it  .

when poi can be implemented entirely by voice , i will be more than impressed if i have a complaint about the magellan product , it would be with their customer support  .

the challenge is not whether your problem will get resolved , but the time and tenacity it takes to get there  .

customer service is professional and courteous , but there seems to be process flow challenges at the end of the day , i would recommend this product based on its simplicity and function  .

though there are features that i would like to see modified , this is a perfectly useful tool that goes everywhere with me .

very good gps , had me driving in circles in connecticut though , also has a bad delay period in cold weather when starting up .

if you're looking of a good basic gps , the 4250 is actually quite good  .

the navigation is intuitive relative to 80% of the other units on the market  .

my only complaint has been trying to track down updates from magellan's web site  .

it's confusing and cryptic .

despite some of the negative opinions in these reviews , i bought a 4250 when costco put them on sale for $249  .

just like the negative reviews noted , i had problems with the on/off button , sluggish response to the touchpad and lock    ups  .

less than 24 hours after i first turned it on the unit locked up on the opening screen and could never get beyond it (use of the reset button , and numerous power cycles could not resolve)  .

but , rather than give in i traded it in for another (why  .

$249 for a gps that best buy had on sale for $399  .

i had to try)  .

amazingly , the 2nd one has worked great for a week , both in virginia and traveling in nevada  .

the routing is spot on and the display and voice cues are excellent  .

the on/off button and lagging touch screen are not a problem on this unit as they were on the first cons   believe the reviews about the pois  .

mine shows a bank on a street corner near my house where there hasn't been a bank for at least 5 years  .

it also shows a bank in a residential subdivision where i'm quite sure there's never been a bank  .

however , it also had the address for a relatively new costco in las vegas  .

it's almost like their new pois are just added in with their old ones , instead of being given a thorough scrubbing  .

the radio has activated the voice commands twice ; and you cannot say cancel because you might cancel the route  .

i haven't found the voice command to tell the magellan i did not want to use voice commands , so a quick push on the back button is the best way i've found to fix the issue bottom line   i now believe many of the negative reviews    my first unit is hard to turn on and off and rendered itself useless in less than 24 hours  .

i now also believe the glowing reviews    my second unit has spot    on navigation , a gorgeous screen and voice commands that work  .

i do use pois    i hope magellan can get someone to do a thorough scrub of their 6 million my recommendation   buy one    and if it starts acting screwy out of the box , take it back and get another soon  .

if it works out of the box , keep it    i think you'll be very happy .

i bought the 4250 after going to a local retailer that had a fairly large live display of many models including competitor units i read many reviews here and at other sites , and i found a lot of bias in the reviews i compared the 4250 against the tomtom 920t , and the garmin nuvi770  .

all three units had similar feature sets  .

the tomtom has almost annoying icons like mcd's etc but some people may like that , i just found it a very busy map  .

also , the unit is loaded up with dennis hopper's voice , that kinda spooked me face it , guys buy gps units because they are perpetually lost , why would we take directions from another guy  .

lol but there is some pleasing british lady voices of the 3 , the tomtom is the only unit that did not have a gps signal in the store so i pushed that one aside next the garmin 770 is nice , i really liked it , the predictive text feature is the fastest and most accurate i have ever seen  .

it figured out what i is typing much sooner than the other two and since i live in bfe that impressed me  .

i also love the garmin quality recognition and seeing the 2008 cd rom of map updates made me happy as well  .

the voice database is adequate , but it is more costly and still did not have a true itinerary planner i ended up with the magellan  .

it's aaa poi database is very comprehensive , the itinerary feature works well , and over all i liked the user interface better  .

the fact it is over a hundred dollars less than the other two pushed me to give it a try  .

i figured if it didn't work out i'd return it for trade on the garmin  .

so a couple weeks later it still works fantastically  .

the things i don't like are it's slightly outdated map  .

i don't see anyway to upgrade them as the website does not list a current map upgrade available  .

also it only has one voice  .

would love to add a more pleasant voice  .

the predictive text works , but it is slower than the 770  .

the itinerary planner works great , but doesn't pull in the aaa poi's , you have to use the offline software for custom poi's  .

have not had it freeze like others have complained about , but it did lock up once in a hissy fit that made me think it completely died  .

but a few moments later it did turn back on after continuing to press it's kinda stupid power button  .

perhaps since it has a travel case , it has an accidental power button press detection  .

so other than mispronunciation of some street names , this thing works very well , and for the money , the features are what i wanted in a gps .

does almost everything except drive the car  .

big bright screen , poi's that you can call from the device , yes while you are driving the number pops up and you can call right from your car great for too  .

needs more poi though  .

bluetooth that connects quickly to both of my cell phones (blackberry razor) , routing options , speaker/speakerphone with easy volume control (my family told me that it sounded as though i is on a speakerphone , great for the new law in ca in july 2008 which prohibits cell use in cars without handsfree device) , quick connectivity to bluetooth and satellites (avg 30 secs to 1  .

5 minutes) , touch screen user friendly  .

1    2 sec delay on position (seemed more accurate/responsive with microsoft's streets and trips gps) , needs longer battery life , cannot import phone numbers , missing street names on mapping function  .

my home address cannot be found in this mapping  .

i live on a small cul de sac  .

all in all though i love it  .

updated  .

on oct 13 , 2010  .

i am comparing the 4250 and the nuvi 650 real time currently in my car  .

the flip antenna for the 650 is annoying  .

the 4250 built in means that it is ready to go and lays flat inside my car (did not mount either and they work fine)  .

but the flip antenna seems flimsy  .

the 4250 has been more exact with prompts when i actually needed them  .

the 650 actually had me go a bit out of the way    which is contrary to what i have read in other reviews  .

aaa feature is very nice    i will update this as i conclude my test  .

excellent unit  .

cannot wait until the bugs are worked out of the mapping program  .

the route exclusion feature needs to be placed in memory for the trip so it does not need a redo to get the route you need  .

the fastest way routing needs serious refinement to insure the quickest and fastest way  .

right now the best the 4250 can do is about 70% of the accuracy of the magellan 760 for this mapping  .

get with it guys programing is essential .

this is my experience with magellan technical support and customer service since i had registered with magellan after purchasing my maestro 4250 north america and log in from time to time  .

and since i had since i had installed one of the updates before    version 4  .

60 sure i wanted to try out the new update version 4  .

85 i tried to do this in march before our spring break trip to la and san diego  .

the installer said something about a file being corrupt    the installation continued without my being able to stop it  .

the result    constantly rebooting gps , cancelling routes resulted in hanging the machine , the 4250 is always lost or is always having difficulty re    finding it's location  .

in short a trashed gps to be used in a thousand mile roadtrip (and i bought this from toysr'us dec 22 , 2008  .

i tried what i could to fix it before and after our trip  .

i called technical support many times  .

hit the reset switch more times than i could recall  .

downloaded the software update again and again from the magellan site  .

tried to install the software in safe mode  .

there is no undo to go back to the previous version of an update (i later learned from customer support  .

) and i am fairly comfortable around technology i sent this back to magellan  .

i dilly    dallied before doing this  .

i had read all the negative reviews about magellan customer service by then  .

but i couldn  .

t return it to toysr'us since it had phased out the sale of all gps units  .

finally i bit the bullet , crossed my fingers hoping the same things wouldn  .

t happen to me , and sent it to them it took all of three weeks to get the 4250 back to me  .

they replaced it with a refurbished 4250  .

sure it had the 4  .

85 update and seemed to work well  .

but it now had the navteq 2  .

9 maps  .

my magellan had the 3  .

1 maps , which i take it to be the 2008    2009 maps  .

that already had many outdated and false pois and i is supposed to take this  .

also the screen of the thing is really rough    they didn't bother to wrap the screen with a proper screen protector just an ordinary plastic wrap  .

try as i might i couldn't take the roughness of totally with the use of lcd wipes  .

also the bezel is creaking on one side  .

the worst thing of all is when i looked at the serial no it is manufactured about 173 , 000 plus units before mine is that would place its manufacture at around 2007  .

none only is it old looking , it is really old  .

i say this because my new 4250 is very sleek and nary had a scratch on it of course i had to send it back  .

i explained my concerns to a customer rep then asked for a supervisor  .

the manager i talked to , ashley , on magellan customer support told me that i couldn't get my original unit back , i could get another replacement though  .

i also couldn't get a new 4250 since it had been phased out according to her  .

i then insisted on a service gps while they went about sending me a replacement  .

she told me she needed my credit card information in case i didn't return the service gps when the replacement gps arrived  .

what person in his right mind would do this    sending good money after bad  .

so we settled on i sending the unit back and receiving it from magellan within 6 days  .

my thinking is i had shamed them into expediting the replacement they sent me an rma through email  .

i used this to fedex the gps to lavergne , tennessee where their repair/return facility is located on may 5  .

it's now day 8 , on the magellan web site , my repair status says they now say they received the gps on may 13  .

i guess magellan or their customer support took me for a ride  .

so my advice to you is don't install any more updates from magellan  .

don't rely on their support  .

in the future do not buy anything from magellan  .

i hope this helps someone fb castro in n  .

california  .

ps while i is writing i is on hold at magellan customer support for more than 30 minutes already  .

to be fair before it took a lesser amount of time to reach a customer rep  .

now maybe they know my number already and just want to wait me out  .

i decided to hang up and just continue writing this  .

maybe i  .

ll send this to the bbb and to other exasperated    with    magellan blogs later .

iif you buy this product and support is needed from magellan you will not be satisfied .

overall a great gps  .

clear picture , accurate directions and easy to hear voice/chime  .

occasionally it will give you the long way to a destination (no short cuts)  .

the timing to your turns could be a bit better so you're not making abrupt turns but it is not that far off the mark  .

easy to use (even while being distracted by the kids) i'll never miss my destination again .

i just used this product on a trip to florida  .

although i pride myself in navigating sometimes without a map all over the country i is impressed with the 4250  .

the freeway poi is helpful when looking for gas or a quick bite  .

the touch screen however sometimes takes multiple pokes at it to get it to respond  .

this gets frustrating especially in heavy traffic when your eyes should be concentrating on the road  .

for a test i drove off the freeway on i    81 in virginia on a country road hoping the gps would guide me back  .

i ended up on a us forest service road which is one lane , unpaved and too icy to navigate with my lexus  .

i had to turn back and retrace my route .

find this until feb 2 for $350 at costco  .

com and in the stores  .

garmin 680 is $480 there also .

i travelled from omaha to southern alberta  .

i had purchased a garmin 680 (was actually looking for a 650 as the gps functions are the same but less bells and whistles and cheaper) the 680 is decent but once i got to billings i returned the 680 and purchased the 4250  .

saving myself about $130 the 4250 does everything i need , i would have no problem recommending it while travelling with it i had not read how to use the voice command , even without that it is impressive  .

when i got home and figured out how to use the voice command simply amazing the aaa info in it is awesome .

i like the functionality of the device in general and think that the gps functions work well on this device  .

i would like to see better and more map updates than are available  .

i had a problem with my gps turning off and not being able to turn it back on after having it for about a week  .

am currently working with customer support  .

other reviews that i am now reading indicate similar problems and frustrations with getting it repaired or replaced  .

it would be nice if they created a more stable device that would not have so many issues with the same problem  .

i purchesed the unit for a good price and would recommend it as long as you are not looking for a good bluetooth device and want to take the chance at having some mechanical problems like the device not turning on regardless of battery or wall power after a few weeks .

the designers , whom i hope read this , should keep in mind that some people are color blind  .

i am color blind to green red  .

actually color deficient , and have a hard time destinguishing the route against the background in the day mode  .

night mode is fine  .

they should give you different options in choosing map color combinations .

this is a decent gps device  .

its interface is nice    the map looks good on the screen , it goes into night mode when it gets dark , it actually states the street names , and it's pretty easy to operate however , while its directions are usually good , they can sometimes be odd    for example , it may tell you to start your trip by going northbound on a freeway for a few miles , only to tell you next to change your direction and go southbound on that very same freeway  .

my other main problem with this is its speed of calculation    if you go off its route , it does not recalculate the route as quickly as i'd like  .

finally    and this is not a major problem to me    it sometimes takes a minute or two for the gps to connect to the satellites .

for the money you cannot beat the features  .

i read a lot of reviews on cnet before buying it  .

my c330 died and i returned it (love sams club  .

i wanted to step up to something nicer , but didn't want to drop $300 on something that was not a great necessity as my wife has a garmin c580 we could use on trips  .

i got it for $250 at costco which is a relative steal  .

i knew to expect some issues , but is willing to give it a try  .

i would suggest that if you do buy it make sure you can return it when you cannot stand it anymore  .

i got the bluetooth to work with my blackjack ii once , granted it's not officially supported , but the call quality is the worst  .

i'm a techie and i gave up on trying to re    synch this thing with my phone , it wouldn't work  .

the biggest annoyance is the interface , slow slow slow if you miss a turn your going to wait 15    20 seconds for this thing to to re    route you  .

if you do not have a general sense of where you are going and are traveling at highway speeds this could prove to be a costly problem , with the way gas is going these days  .

the poi's are good they include phone numbers , but they are sightly outdated  .

it's a decent gps but it should absolutely not be in the top 5 just based on performance  .

i'm keeping this until the garmin i want comes down in price then it's going back .

i is all set to get the garmin 580c , and i wish i would have  .

the lower end garmin's i have used before which are set up like the 580c seem to be a little faster than this one  .

the traffic feature works fairly well  .

if the gps makers ever get smart enough to sync with microsoft outlook , so you can have your address's and phone numbers (blue    tooth)loaded into the gps i will definetly give that one a serious look  .

it is kind of dumb that they do not  .

overall it does what it is supposed to do , and it has come in handy many times  .

now the question remains , when the hell will they update the maps or are we stuck with the 2006 maps  .

have only had this item for 2 weeks and the backlight on the unit died  .

could hear the unit working , but could not see a thing  .

called support and had to ship back to them ($17  .

00 w/ins  .

) and is told it would take 3    4 weeks to return the unit  .

not what i expected from magellan  .

otherwise , for the short time i used it , worked well in the metro atlanta area .

peter teiman franklin here ,  .

this is a useful product well worth the price and very accurate peter teiman franklin ,  .

sweden  .

we purchased the garmin 650 and magellan 4250 to compare both  .

while the magellan is ok , it did not compare to the 650 in the features that we were looking for  .

i'm sure for others who look for a unit to plan a driving vacation this would be a good unit with good features , but i wanted it for basic directions and accuracy  .

here is what we found    .

entering the addresses is easy , but a little more complex than the garmin (however , not as bad as other reviews i had seen)  .

the garmin gave notice of turns ahead of the magellan but the magellan has a split screen showing the next turn direction (i prefer the garmin with the turn arrow on the road) arriving at the destination i is disappointed the magellan did not indicate the destination on the left or right side of the road (garmin does)  .

also found that at one destination the magellan had me make a u    turn that put me on the correct side of the road but on the opposide side of the cross    street (had to make another u    turn to arrive at destination) bluetooth is substandard by far  .

connection is spotty and difficult to hear  .

at times when attempting to make a call the phone would connect but the magellan would not show the connected call (or even that the phone is dialling)  .

persons on the other side indicated the phone would cut out or disconnect on occasion  .

i would much prefer purchasing a $40 headset that works much better than this the screen is not as bright as the garmin and is not readable from the side  .

the driver will be the only one who can easily see the unit or both driver and passanger can have a dim view we cannot speak to the traffic , but after a week we decided to return the unit and keep the garmin  .

why is this good  .

well , the design is sleek and the battery life seems to last longer than garmin  .

also , if you were planning a trip you could enter multiple destinations (garmin allows only one stop)  .

the magellan is also able to be configured to change the detour distance  .

the magellan has the next exit feature that also indicates what services are located at the next off    ramp when on the freeway  .

finally , magellan displays poi markers on the 3d map indicating what is around overall , a good unit and one i would consider if we drove on vacation  .

however , the issues they have make it not worth keeping over the garmin .

first let me xplain this is a refurb , so maybe they didn't work out the bugs before they resold it  .

i liked most features , the wide screen and the aaa extras  .

the refurb price is only $130 so that is tempting  .

it seemed to get lost at time , telling me to turn when there is no road (once)  .

i is about a mile from home and it suddenly told me to turn left , go 1 block , turn right , 2 blocks , then turn right 1 block (bringing me back to my original route  .

when i did not follow the directions it told me to perform the same detour , but this time to my right , then back to the original route  .

lastly it kept insisting i lived on the opposite side of the road  .

the good features were good enough that i'm willing to try another , so i returned this one .

i've had this device for about 1 year now and have used it extensively across the country  .

most notably nyc/nj , denver , southern california , northern california , and most recently , seattle  .

from time to time it's route calculations are a bit off and end up adding time to your route regardless of which routing option you choose (fastest time , most highways , etc)  .

i've finally decided to get rid of this device after using it for the past few months in the seattle area  .

when i first attempted to use it getting out of the airport , it took me on a 15 minute detour  .

when i tried to get back to the airpost , it took me on a 1 hour detour on a bunch of industrial side streets  .

a lot of the roads out here are labeled as state highways but post a 35 mph speed limit  .

i do not think the mapping software understands the difference or the programmers f'd up when writing the route calculation software  .

getting on i405 or i5 to go anywhere is typically the easiest and fastest method to travel for me however this device insists on making me get off freeways and go local no matter which routing option i choose  .

i'm not sure how the mapping software (navteq) and the route calculations interact , but i cannot get from point a to point b anywhere in seattle metro without having to take major detours and scenic routes  .

i have the 2007 mapping software that came with the original release of this device  .

the in    dash factory nav unit in my car never has these issues    only when i take my other car out and have to use the 4250 (no factory nav)  .

i am hesitant to spend more money to update to the 2008 maps because who knows if the routing has been corrected  .

i've tried to call cs but as most other users note    it is pathetic  .

i will probably go to costco since they have great return policies and give the garmin units a try  .

i owened the nuvi 350 for over 2 years prior to upgrading to the 4250  .

routing on the 350 is good but satellite acquisition is awful    sometimes took 15 minutes from both cold and warm starts  .

as rock bottom price it's a good buy  .

i purchased this unit less than a week ago and i already have to pay $80 to upgrade the map  .

there are better units out the but for the money it's a good buy  .

updated  .

on sep 13 , 2008  .

i bought this system about 1 month ago , and today as i finished writng this review i'm taking it back to the store first of all when you get directions it always gives you the longest way and alerts you of trafic until you are already stock in it , if want to avoid traffic or want to take a detour forget it better do not do it beacuse all you are doing is risking to get into the worst route you have ever chosen also when the system alets you when to make a turn it beeps right when you have to make the turn with no time to let you maneuver , this is a big problem if you do not know the area as you would have to go back and make the turn where you had to  .

(but do not worry about missing turns because one of the great features of this system is that it gets you back on track with the repositional feature turn by turn it relocates your position right away and in no time you are back on track to your destination) the second thing is the voice command you have to be in a very low noise environment in order to use this feature otherwise is like not having it it just does not work right in noisy environments third of all , if you choose a route and for any reason no matter what you get stock in traffic or just stop on a light after a few minutes of being in the same spot instead of keeping the same route the system will relocate you and give you new directions , so sometimes it gets you to the longest drive or sometimes you are lucky and get the shortes one and also with the route features which gives you the option for the shortest time , shortest distance , avoid freeways or detours it is almost impossible to get the best route with this system now for the beginer and people who really need a system to drive turn by turn it , i do recommend it but for those familiar with the routes and who are experience drivers i do not think this would be a great gps , i guess i'm going to try another gps and see what happens if you think my review is not fair , please try this gps and see for yourself i'm not saying with all this that magellan is not a good company or that this is a bad gps but for the price i is waiting for something better .

it took three tries to get one that worked  .

the tech support is very good but sometimes difficult to understand  .

the unit i have works well but there is a software hang    up  .

when i turn it on , it indicates the last location from where it is shut off  .

they said it needs a software reset by holding the on button down for ten seconds  .

ok all well and good  .

but on my way out the door i need to use my map book to find my first stop because this thing takes about 3    5 minutes for the satellite to find me  .

this is irritating  .

the traffic alert is unable to inform me of a 3 to 1 lane reduction that had been there for 6 months  .

overall i am not satisfied wished i had tried the competition  .

brought it home and thought there is a problem immediately  .

the supplied cd allows you to download vantagepoint  .

it wouldn't recognize my unit and then i called the uncaring customer support who informed me that the 4250 is not supported by any pc application  .

then why give out the cd  .

the bluetooth is marginal at best  .

the voice commands are great if all you want to do is find a starbucks or restaurants that have been closed for a while  .

used it for about an hour and got tired of it fast  .

our ford navigation system is much better even though it does not have all the bells and whistles  .

returning it in the morning .

customer service is deplorable  .

i have never seen customer service this bad  .

this is my 3rd magellan unit , beginning with a roadmate 760  .

it maps were outdated by 18 months or so  .

they had promised map updates in 6 , 12 , and 18 months , and i finally got the updat just shy of 2 years  .

when the map upgrade is available , it is 69  .

00 and after i loaded it , the gps failed  .

it would not hold initialization  .

called magellan several times before i got someone to say that the map upgrade had hurt the 760 , and they were going to sent me a 4210 , which looks like a 4250  .

also at that time they had discontinued the 760 and the 4210 is a free replacement  .

the 4210 does not give voice directions  .

their website said the 4210 gave voice turning directions , in 2 different places  .

called magellan again and explained the 4210 no voice guidence for turning  .

after holding forever , a standard practice when calling them , a different fellow got on the line and said they would send me a 4250 which does give voice guidence turning directions  .

they did send the 4250 promptly their customer support is in the phillipines and are i guess filipinos  .

it is very , very hard to understand what they say and you have to constantly ask them to slow down and repeat what they said their website registration process has been down 2 or 3 weeks now  .

i am unable to register the product for warrenty purposes  .

it's still down for this purpose today , 2/20/08 i have emailed them and gotten no responses i have been placed on hold and they have never returned  .

i have been promised to return phone calls in 24 hours , and they have never come i recently found out that the maps in the 4250 are from first quarter of 2007 , making them about a year old and they are the latest for the 4250  .

yet the 760 maps , released in late december 2007 , will not work on the 4250  .

no word from them on when the 4250 maps will be updated , other than about 18 months it also does not talk to my cell phone which is only 3 years old and bluetooth capable knowing what i know now , the next gps will be a garmin , and i'm telling everyone i know of my bad experiences with magellan  .

never again  .

in fact i had decided to shoot a hole in the 760 and return it , and go buy a garmin , when the 760 map problem arose , so i tried once more  .

at least i still have a gps i can use .

i've used this unit for a month now and feel that it's not as special as cnet made it out to be  .

it can easily get you from one place to another , but as far as the extras that set it apart , they are either buggy , or a joke the good   this unit has a large screen which is easy to view and use , decent speaker , and easy interface  .

it gets me where i need to go fairly quickly and the eta function is pretty good  .

i let a friend use it who has never owned a gps and they successfully made it to where they needed to go  .

aaa roadside assistance information is very handy as well  .

it gives you cross streets , lat and longitude , elevation , and other information which can help you if you have a problem  .

also , when searching the poi's it gives you the address and telephone number for your choice  .

if connected via bluetooth and you touch the telephone number on the screen , it will automatically dial the number for you  .

as you will read later , the bluetooth is terrible so this great idea turned out to be disappointing the bad    .

as you have read not many people are happy with the bluetooth functions on it  .

the user manual in general is very short , and offers no help with bluetooth functions on it  .

through trial and error i found out how to pair my gps to my phone , how to dial phone numbers , and how to use the entire phone section  .

i am not kidding when i say the user manual completely ommitted a large portion within the phone section the microphone is terrible and can barely be understood by people on the other end  .

the unit is mounted on my dash about 3 feet from my mouth , and with the car stopped , and radio off i could not be understood  .

if i held the unit a foot from my face i could be understood clearly  .

also you can say magellan and it will give you options to direct you home , cancel a route , etc  .

because the microphone is a joke it will either not work correctly , or go off while the radio is playing the poi's are outdated and the maps need some help  .

4 year old construction jobs that have closed down offramps are not in the unit , so you have to drive around lost and wait until the unit redirects you  .

also tech support and the magellan website are poor this unit can help you get from point a to point b pretty easily  .

that's the job of a gps so that's why i gave it an average rating  .

it doesn't get anything higher because the extras do not deliver  .

compared to a year old tom tom 910 , the tom tom has more user options , voice prompts , languages , an external microphone , and better traffic options  .

the magellan works , but it could be better  .

hope this helps .

the magellan 4250 has many good features and initially i is very happy  .

after using the unit for several days it suddenly would not power up  .

i tied over several days to power    up on battery , with the aid of the car charger and with the aid of the power receptacle charger  .

nothing worked  .

i returned the unit to costco and purchased another it took less time for the second unit to produce the same problem  .

this time i called magellan tech support i is very disappointed with this process  .

first of all for two days i rang the number and the message i received was , your call cannot be put through at this time  .

try again later  .

in frustration on the third day i chose sales instead of tech support  .

the call is answered and i is put through to tech support  .

magellan tech support is in india and although the people were very courteous , they seemed to be far from technical experts  .

i spoke to tech support on two occasions and each time the person i spoke to had to speak to someone else for the answer  .

magellan tech support is more like a call centre in my opinion  .

as english is not the first language of the tech support agents , i had some difficulty explaining my problem and understanding their response  .

tech support told me to push the reset button on the bottom of the unit to resolve the problem and when that did not work they told me i would have to send the unit in for repair i am returning the unit to costco and will purchase a new unit once again  .

third time luck , right  .

i am also checking out garmin's equivalent model .

the gps is good  .

but the customer service but the worst customer service ever  .

this unit replaced our megellan older 720 model  .

the 4250 works ok as a basic gps road guide  .

additional features are not user friendly and the owners manual is confusing  .

megellan's phone support is useless if you're buying this for a gps/roadguide , you wil be satisied , if you're looking for the additional bells whistles , you're likely to be disappointed .

this is the second gps i'd ever owend , and both i owned within the last 3 weeks  .

i'd gotten the nuvi 650 for christmas , and unfortunately , it must have been damaged because it is having a hard time establishing a satellite while the vehicle is in motion  .

however , the few times it did work , the maps poi's were very accurate (i tested it out on familiar trips)  .

however , being very disappointed by the satellite issue , i returned it instead got the magellan maestro 4250 and although it had a sleeker look (no flip    up antenna) , came with a 3 month free trial to a traffic service that updates you on road conditions (and only costs about $40  .

00/yr if you decide to keep it) , and had the poi icons right on the map visible while driving , i found that the unit did not perform as far as getting me to a destination using the best route or even finding the nearest grocery store (as the poi function is supposed to work  .

if i hadn't owned the nuvi for two weeks prior and experienced how well it navigated my routes how accurate it is with the poi's , i may not have returned the magellan and thought that all gps' worked that way i do not recommend this device  .

when you can pay a little more and get the nuvi 680 which has all the bells whistles (and more) that this one does but with better maps poi's  .

i do not work for nuvi , i'm just a consumer that does not like spending a lot of money on sub    par merchendise want to pass on what i learned from this experience  .

i is lucky that the purchase is made at a wholesale warehouse because i is able to return both units without paying a re    stocking fee .

i got the 4250 @ costco for $350  .

absolute best price at the time , according to my research  .

circuit city selling same unit for $500  .

i thought i is getting just what i wanted at pretty good price  .

i wanted a gps with bluetooth capability without all the other needless extra features like mp3 player and jpeg viewer  .

this is going to fit the bill perfectly  .

well ok , i knew from cnet review that the unit didn't synchronize phone list , but i is willing to let that slide because i thought as i make calls i would save to the 4250's contact list  .

wrong  .

you have to manually add addresses for a phone list  .

i don't want addresses , i want a phone list  .

i have phone contacts that i don't even know addresses for  .

for instance , to add my wife son as separate listings , you have to enter the city , then street , then street number  .

then a screen comes up that you can add home , work and mobile number  .

come on magellan , get with the program  .

then the bluetooth would sometimes pair and somtimes not pair  .

i have a motorola e815 phone  .

i only had the unit 2 days and it is just a hassle to try to use  .

first time using it took the wife shopping , so i'm in the car not moving , windows up , radio off , i call the house and leave a message  .

when i get home i play the message and all i hear are pops cracks and static  .

it is supposed to have sms texting  .

doesn't work with my phone  .

when i did get the bluetooth to connect with the phone and received a text message it would disconnect the bluetooth  .

then i might be able to reconnect or not  .

it is a crap shoot on that  .

this is the deal breaker for me  .

i returned it to costco and picked up the garmin nuvi 680 for $480  .

so i shelled out another $130 for extras i do not really want as far as graphics are concerned , i thought they were great  .

the unit is sleek and stylish and compact  .

i just wished the features would work as advertised .

i bought the 4250 and is excited as it's a beautiful device packed with a lot of features for the money  .

i haven't seen tomtom's up close (the 920 looks good online) , but to me , the 4250 is far more attractive than the nuvi 680 the 4250's screen is sharper and brighter , although , the nuvi has larger easier to read fonts when driving  .

overall , i think the 4250's screen is great the 4250's voice prompt functions are fun and somewhat useful  .

you may have to repeat yourself several times , but you can keep your eyes on the road and say magellan , distance to destination and it will tell you how far you have to go , and when you will arrive  .

that's actually pretty cool the menu system is good , very intuitive  .

the predictive text is great the pois and aaa pois are very cool  .

garmin charges $69 for their travel guide unfortunately , the 4250 froze up on me a few times  .

it is frozen over 3 minutes under clear skies so i don't know what is going on  .

all i could do is shut it off and turn it back on  .

it found sats within seconds after rebooting i had a problem signing up for the free 3 month traffic subscription that comes with the 4250  .

the bottom line is the foreign csr is unable to help me register for my free subscription that i rate and said i needed to pay for an annual subscription if i wanted the traffic service  .

that's a deal breaker to me customer service is farmed out overseas and the csrs cannot help you with anything more basic troubleshooting  .

even though you can create an account online and enter all of your personal information , the csr doesn't have access to your account  .

you have to speak slowly , and repeat the very same information that you already entered online there's no email support of any kind either i sent a letter to them just after thanksgiving , and i still haven't heard back from them  .

i don't expect to if the 4250 were to stop working i don't trust magellan to support it  .

garmin on the other hand has a fantastic reputation for customer service the 4250s list of phones supported for bluetooth is very limited  .

i have a sony w300i , there is no way to sync my contacts , and no automatic pairing  .

i can manually pair it and it works for basic hands free use , but thats it  .

magellan is way behind on this compared to garmin i want magellan's features/hardware with garmin's customer service and bluetooth functionality (and smaller windshield mount) since i cannot have both , i decided to buy the garmin nuvi 680 and return the 4250  .

the 680 cost me more than the 4250 , but it automatically pairs with my phone , and my contacts automatically synchronized too  .

the 680 has worked flawlessly it's too bad , because i really liked the 4250 , and i normally don't worry about customer support , but these things are expensive and i'm not going to support a company that does not support their product if you do buy the 4250 , get it from a warehouse store in case you need to return it someday hardware 8 , customer support 0 , that's why they get a 5  .

sorry for being so wordy , but this is a real eval .

pretty good for the money if you have a windows computer , otherwise do not even think about it  .

i'm still suffering from acute buyer's remorse .

unit cannot be used with windows 7 based computers pr software or map updates  .

company support and way out of date maps is enough to return the unit to store  .

i used these a lot in the last month and the database is so out of date for small towns it's ridiculous  .

if you do not need small towns , it's a pretty good unit  .

you just have to get used to the fact that the turn ding may come 1/2 to 1 1/2 blocks early so you have to check the screen before making the turn  .

until i got used to that i found it rerouts you very quickly , although there is a slight tone of exasperation when it announces it's recalculating the route .

i have owned two generations of the magellan products  .

the second (maestro 4040) only because it is a gift  .

the first is slow and inaccurate with outdated maps  .

the 4040 is much faster with an internal antenna , but the product is flimsy  .

i have read many reviews on this site about the ineffectiveness of the bluetooth to which i will only add ditto  .

it is not functional  .

the biggest problems i had were when things were broken or did not work the maps being out of date and trying to update them through the site is serviceable with the roadmate  .

the maestro 4040 is another issue altogether  .

the site navigation is confusing and misleading  .

by clicking on a link for map updating i actually got a firmware update  .

when calling customer service (off shore) i got no more help than talking to myself  .

i also had the same experience when the receptacle for the power cord (either from a wall outlet or car power outlet) to be connected to the unit became loose and broke off  .

i called to see if there is some sort of local repair for the unit  .

there is not a local repair facility  .

then i find that the process to get the repair will take at least 3 weeks  .

this is not acceptable  .

all other problems aside  .

if the unit is not going to be supported by customer service or technical support/repair , i do not need it  .

the main reason for this product not being at least average is the major problem of keeping it in use and optimal performance .

i had a garmin for years but saw the voice command advertised and thought it woud really make driving safer  .

wrong my old garmin is also faster calculating the route .

bought this because of the price and availability , not because of the bluetooth or voice capabilities  .

it's top    o    da    line somewhere  .

i read the previous posts pros/cons about this product , but wanted to see for myself the megellan maestro 4250 is certainly a do    able gps if your eyesight is perfect  .

i use readers at the computer and my distance vision is perfecto  .

and fortunately when i'm driving i don't need them  .

but i found that the guidance font across the bottom of the screen is so small that it is virtually not a usable tool  .

i needed to scramble to put on my glasses which is not a normal part of my driving routine  .

sorry officer but  .

i had to rely on the voice commands , which in the past have either been wrong or late , or just plain annoying and thus muted  .

being able to plan in advance my next manuever , in x minutes and x miles , i find to be a real handy bit of information  .

in addition , i like my actual speed and eta to the next fix to always be displayed in a legible font size  .

i wouldn't call this a don't bother gps , but if you have to rely on your readers everytime you want to refresh your brain , then i cannot recommend it  .

the font size is fixed , it's simply a software issue and will probably never be changed until the next generation of units become available , if at all  .

i could not care less about using the voice commands , that technology will always be flawed or behind  .

i know i'm being pessimistic , but come on , are you really having trouble finding a gas station  .

you will find yourself raising your voice or repeating yourself over and over  .

and worrying about bluetoothin' with my phone , again another gee    whiz and somewhat useless tool  .

even though it worked for my phone , albeit poorly , it's not what the gps is designed to do  .

just answer your phone or get a quality earpiece if it's that important  .

it's a gps , stick to the basics , and hope that it's realiable  .

another major disappointment is the basemap software is 9 months out    of    date  .

shame on you magellan  .

these units are selling faster than that  .

purchased mine at costco 3/17/08  .

but for another $100 you can download the latest maps  .

i would expect that magellan would at the very least sell a product that has the latest mapping software available or support your purchase for 30 days and offer a free download  .

with an aviation career background i expected a little more from this product  .

a core gps built on a solid foundation is what i'll be looking for  .

garmin , are you home  .

we got this unit for our 10 hr road trip to las vegas , nv  .

the first unit we bought (from costco online) is defective right out of the box  .

although it is plugged in to the outlet , we could not get past the screen where you can choose to have the unit battery powered  .

so we packed it up and wanted to exchange for another working unit at our local costco  .

that in itself is a headache because our local warehouse wanted us to pay the full price since the unit we bought online is on sale  .

long story short , we were able to exchange it for another one this second unit worked fine and we got to vegas no problems but that is it  .

the day after we arrived , it would not get pass the boot up screen  .

called so    called tech support and no help  .

very scriptive  .

finally told us to send it in because the hardware is corrupted (after a day of good use)  .

luckily we had family in the area and had previously printed out hard copy maps just in case  .

we are returning this and perhaps get another brand i'm very disappointed because i love most things about this unit if only it would actually be reliable and function properly  .

however if you get two defective units barely days into owning it , makes you question whether it's the manufacturer or dealer .

if this unit ever breaks down as mine did it is a nightmare to deal with thier customer or techinal depts  .

it is the most user unfrienly method of getting a ra (return authorization)  .

you can send mail after mails and you would receive no reply from thier site  .

be aware that you have no avenue but to work on thier schedule  .

any time you phone them thier system is down  .

they sell you a unit but offer you no back up service  .

it is totally zero  .

i know i am suffering it if i had a choice i would never buy from magellan .

pros   the screen is big and bright and very crisp much nicer than my roadmate 2200t  .

the point of interest (poi) database is noticeably larger than the 2200t , and includes lots of stores rather than predominantly restaurants  .

the aaa tourbook is pretty cool because it lets you find something new and interesting with a nice detailed restaurant description without having to bust out city search , though honestly , i haven't used it for much  .

you cannot search based on food type like you can in the normal poi area  .

when i'm looking to explore , i probably have an idea of what type of food i'm craving my big con   i bought the unit , charged it up , played with it in the house all seemed well  .

the next morning i went to turn it on nothing  .

no matter what i did , i could not get it to turn on  .

customer support declared it dead and offered to replace with 3 week turn around  .

instead i returned it to costco and got another  .

i charged and turned it on , but no satellites at all when my other gpss had great reception  .

i think the receiver is dead  .

later that night , it stopped turning on too  .

that's 2 dead gpss that don't power on with or without ac power  .

i returned it again but didn't turn on bluetooth , just in case  .

all is well for a week , turned on bluetooth and now sometimes it won't turn on just like the others  .

might be the bluetooth don't know for sure  .

but it's really annoying to have a gps that wo not power on , and when it's the third one  .

that's craziness cons (for those whose unit turns on)   the bluetooth sounds really cool , but it's not as useful as i hoped  .

it's not possible to import contacts (even with the custom poi software) , and you cannot access your cell phones #'s either  .

so you can only call built    in pois or people you hand enter name  .

if you hand enter , you must include an address  .

the traffic is very delayed which leads to gross inaccuracies  .

traffic disruptions are point incidences , meaning there is a spot maybe 10ft that is the traffic issue , rather than a whole road segment  .

so , in oregon , it likes to tell me there is 31mph traffic at precise point that is say exit 65  .

to totally avoid rush hour traffic , it takes the exit 65 off ramp (right before the traffic) and then immediately gets back on the highway (right after the traffic)  .

technically it avoided the traffic spot under the bridge  .

if only it were that easy in real life given that this is an expensive device , last night i finally got fed up and gave the garmin nuvi 680 a try , so far i love it and the ui is better  .

i'll be returning the magellan tomorrow .

just opened it at christmas and it is a huge hassle  .

right out of the box it had us located in california but we got passed that  .

info and answers from web site is really problematic  .

if you are a aaa member (we are) you will need to call aaa for some code in order to register the produce  .

maps    of the four addresses we input to test the thing out it had only two  .

(hey , taking the kids to a water park tomorrow , load that trip in  .

no such address  .

going to in laws    no address)  .

also it will peer with a motorola razr but then it forgets it when you power done , so you have to peer it everytime  .

on the plus side it looks great , has a nice user interface .

tried this device for a week , but it's going back  .

i purchased it mainly for the traffic , portability is a factor , as well as availability of text    to    speech i live in the washington dc area  .

the traffic service on the device lagged the every    10    minute radio traffic by up to 20 minutes  .

the 'auto    reroute' did not and the manual one gives you no info on the extent of the backup , so choosing how far to detour is a crapshoot in addition , viewing the manuever list frequently resulted in a an abliity to get back to the map page (using the back arrow caused the map page to flash up briefly , then return to the maneuver page) tiny quibbles   provided usb cable is so short , i had to crouch down next to my machine to hold the device  .

why is there no direct upload of poi's through the usb connection  .

you have to load a file to a memory chip and access through there .

if the magellan 4200 showed the miles and length of trip , it would be better  .

if the maps were trucker friendly which showed all of the clearances of bridges and tunnels , it would be perfect  .

i am sure , in time , that the trucker friendly software will eventually come out  .

the length of trip and hours remaining can be fixed with an upgrade as far as the points of interest is concerned , i agree with another complaint  .

most of the pois are outdated  .

this monor glitche can be fixed with software and upgrades in time  .

in the meantime , i will use the magellan 4200 in my dodge dakota and use the navatlas 3550 in the freightliner .

i is in the market for my first navi gps system  .

did a comparison for navigations that had text to speach , voice command , bluetooth , and lots and lots of points of interest , live traffic update  .

i is picking between tomtom 720 , which is last years model  .

the maestro 4250 , and the garmin nuvi 260w after checking out the units , i took a gamble and went with the maestro which is a brand new model this year with all the features i is looking for and on sale  .

the unit worked fine for one day and one day only  .

then it started having issues powering up  .

it would take my multiple attempts to power up the unit by holding the power button down  .

then i tried to pair the blue took to my lg vx8600 phone  .

while the magellan would recongnize it is paired with a cellular phone , it does not recongnize the cellular phones model or brand  .

i called magellan regarding this issue and they told me that a firm ware needs to be updated however , it is not available yet  .

the problem of powering up persisted and i went back to the store and got an exchange for the same product since the unit is fairly intunitive to use  .

the first unit is returned within 14 days my second exchanged unit lasted me 1 weeek  .

i went to power up the unit one day and it wont go past the magellan screen after start up  .

needless to say , im utterly disappointed in this product and have no confidence in this company's products  .

i would highly recommend consumers to just by another brand other than the magellan  .

by at the risk of knowing you will encounter fialures from this company .

on/off switch broker after 60 days  .

30 days of repair requests and finally a response with a estimate of 30 days for repair .

the 4250 is the only gps i have used but this one is easy to use  .

it got me from san francisco to dc with relatively few problems the first unit froze up to the point customer service wanted me to send it back to them  .

i exchanged it hoping that a new unit would work just find  .

the same problem happened again and that is the last straw for me and magellan when it worked it is slower than i had hoped  .

at highway speeds it had trouble keeping up  .

at lower speeds and congested areas it took a long time to get use to the directions it did get me across the country but as far as recomending it to others i think their are better options out there .

i had purchased the magellan 4040 last year but i started having issues with lag times after i updated the software and errors with bluetooth  .

i exchanged it for the 4250 thinking oh , an updated model , looks nice , let's take it  .

bad idea  .

i went to legoland this same day  .

nice getting there  .

took a little time to update route  .

so on the way back , i plugged it in , and it froze on the ok screen  .

power would not turn it off and reset would not do a thing  .

i left it plugged in all night and took it back to best buy  .

i now have the garmin nuvi 760 what a beautiful gps  .

it kicks butt .

if this humble observer is in any way representative of how magellan handles its customer support , you may want to consider monty python's advice and run away  .

i purchased a roadmate 800 , which worked seemingly well , but i noted a number of errors in their maps  .

on the magellan website , i noted the promise of a june update , which is revised to july , then august , september , and i finally saw it posted in early october  .

of course , it is not downloadable , so i ordered the cd which , when the expedited shipping premium is added , cost me slightly over 90 dollars , and arrived some three weeks later  .

i attempted to install the update , but the wizard refused to recognize my unit's serial number , which began with a 0 , and would not install  .

a series of e    mails to magellan over the next few months resulted only in automated responses , telling me that my file had been updated  .

attempts at calling the toll    free telephone number were all electronically screened into the ozone at various stages of the process , and never once is i put in contact with a tech rep  .

a couple more e    mails later , i received a reply stating their regrets for my inconvenience , and informing me that an error had been identified in the installation wizard       get this       prior to the update having been shipped to you  .

any and all e    mails have been subsequently ignored , including the one which posed the question , why is the update shipped with a known fault , and the one requesting return of my purchase price and shipping costs  .

if you're satisfied with a nice    looking user interface , ok performance and maps which do not show that major interchange or bypass route which is built a couple of years ago , then go for it  .

however , any attempt at obtaining customer support should be accompanied by a wheelbarrow full of prozak parked right next to your computer  .

as for me , while something still remains of my sanity , i now use garmin .

purchased 1/2008  .

i used the magellan 4250 3 times  .

it kept locking up , touch screen would not always take letters or numbers  .

had to power down and up to get it to work  .

finally it would not power up  .

sending back to magellan at my cost probably for a refurbished unit  .

a lot of money for something that apparently has not been perfected yet  .

both went out the same way just locks up  .

i a trucker there on all the time  .

mite be good for once in awhile  .

big , big problem all seemed to work well , until i plugged in usb cable to navigator  .

i lost all menu options , except user option settings  .

no way to recover anything  .

there is no information regarding anything related to hooking up unit to a pc , in the very limited manual , or from the included cd rom manual  .

although it came with a usb cable , my pc could not understand what program it required to communicate with devise  .

i notified customer support at 1    800 number , described problem , and they told me i had lost entire contents of software in memory , when i connected my 1 year old laptop to this devise  .

had to return unit to retail , for exchange  .

i will not make that mistake twice .

the unit is great when it is working properly  .

screen would not unfreeze after 3 mos of ownership  .

took over a week to get the authorization to send it in  .

did not get the unit back for 5    6 wks  .

no info about the problem , they just sent me a different 4250  .

i liked the unit so much i bought the same unit while i is waiting for the repair on my first unit  .

i needed it and i thought i would give one or the other to my husband when i received the repair  .

second repair   unit froze when i tried to update the map  .

repair authorization took only a few days of emails and phone calls  .

i is told to fax information to a fax number i could not get through on for several days  .

i called and is given a different fax  .

i got the same unit back this time with no explanation of the problem  .

the unit now has no pois and no aaa tourbook information  .

i am now on day 2 of waiting for customer service to respond to my email about that problem  .

unit 2 is still working because i decided not to update the map after unit 1 became inoperable  .

before buying , search the internet for the problems people are having with this unit  .

i found a lot of postings when i searched the internet looking for solutions for the problems i is having  .

check out particularly the map update  .

if you buy this 4250 unit now , you will need to update the map at $79  .

99 add that to the price of the unit  .

i did notice that the units in the stores , at half the price i paid for them , have a different hardware version , maybe that makes a difference .

i am on my 2nd unit now in less than 12 months , and now this one is starting to do the same things the first one did  .

(only have a 2nd one since they reluctantly agreed to replace the first one that stopped working  .

do not waste your time on this product , unless you want to continue to replace it every few months  .

this brand of gps just does not last  .

go with another brand like garmin  .

this device guided us to drive against traffic laws  .

it gave wrong adresses  .

it missed many locations and pois  .

the response and correction of venue is too slow  .

the traffic advisor did not function  .

on top of all they have terrible non responding customer service  .

save yourself time and money    try one of their competitors  .

upgraded them to 2 because of relative ease of use .

this company is not one you want to buy from or deal with  .

i bought a brand new gps online , and after i received it , it malfunctioned on the 2nd day of having it  .

it is stuck on a settings screenunable to be used  .

i tried to reset it , but it is evident that my new unit is defective when i got it  .

magellan doesnt have customer service on the weekends , so & & i had to wait until monday to talk to a technical support person  .

i is told to send it to the repair center  .

i talked to about 5 representatives who all must be overseas , and no one is concerned about my defective unit  .

i asked to speak to a supervisor , and i is sent around in circles without getting any help  .

i have wrote letters , made calls and even got the better business bureau involved  .

this company is not willing to back their products  .

they are not willing to satisfy their customers  .

if you received a defective unit , tough & now you have to pay to get it to the repair center  .

evidently , they do not invest in testing their products beforehand or pay a little more for american representatives to service americans  .

how cheap  .

beware  .

ive read reviews before where people received defective units , and i said , oh , thats just one in a millionit wont happen to me  .

well , you never know , do you  .

if they are not willing to back their products , how reliable will their products be  .

how many times will i have to send it off for repairs  .

on its use , its probably near the same as other gps devices  .

on several occasions , i tried to go a certain route that i knew , and the gps would recalculate my route and tell me to go to the next exit and turn around to get back on their route  .

how absurd  .

i didnt want to go that way , so i expected it to reroute me a different way  .

it didnt  .

the bluetooth wanted to turn off when i wasnt talking on it , even though i wanted to keep it enabled while driving  .

so , forget it , enough hassle  .

when typing in a point of interest by name , the buttons are sensitive and letters get repeated  .

when using the trip planner , i wanted to find out the route from one destination to another , but i couldnt get that info until i reached the first destination , then it would take me to the next one  .

great idea , but this trip planner needs some work  .

i would definitely suggest looking into a reputable company for a gps , not magellan .

very disappointed with magellan  .

i regret buying the 4250  .

the 4250 frequently locks up on various pages and requires complete power down and/or reset button to get it unlocked  .

that's quite an issue when you're driving  .

currently , my 4250 is frozen on one page and will not reset  .

calls and e    mails to magellan are pointless  .

their e    mail tech link is a dead link , and phone calls are not answered  .

i wish i could get my pioneer avic    s1 back  .

it is a much better system .

what i thought is a well    researched purcahse turned out to be a total bust  .

the first unit would initialize , but then it would turn off as soon as the power cord is unplugged (after a 6    hour charge)  .

set the unit down on a table and it would spontaneously turn on and show me my location  .

then i could not turn it off  .

the replacement unit would turn on and find my location , but it would not turn off at all (dc power/ac power or battery)  .

nicely designed but too many functionality problems for the money .

the map database of the maestro series is now about 3 years old , and updates have been delayed to post    september 2008 according to magellan  .

there is no point of discussing the features of these units , some good and some bad (many bugs in the software  .

; useless routing calculations for long    distance routes) , if the database does not contain the major highways in urban areas (e  .

research blvd in austin , tx , is mapped as a surface street rather than the elevated 6 or 8 lane highway that it is now for more than 3 yrs)  .

i am back at printing online directions from mapquest  .

if magellan were an honest company , they would print the date of the map database on the box  .

but they do not  .

and with no updates , you are stuck with a useless piece of hardware .

there is an issue with the 4250 , that it will lose its memory at the drop of a hat  .

previous reviewer lost on usb hookup , i lost it when battery warning came on  .

it took about five seconds for it to turn itself off before i could hookup power , and everything is gone  .

total time owned    2 days i is halfway through trip to parts unknown , so since i found a circuit city before i found walmart for an atlas i bought another one to continue mission  .

i crapped out next day when i turned it on  .

tech support has no clue on this issue  .

they referred me elsewhere on the offshore phone bank and they were worse  .

until they come out with new firmware    beware  .

i used a garmin nuvi for a trip that took me all over europe  .

it had its limitations but the routes it chose were intuitive    and 99% of the time made absolute sense  .

then i drove around america    visiting every city    and for the united states i made the mistake of buying the magellon maestro  .

the routes it chose were stupid    the software is inflexible    and we spent a lot of time going back and forth with the map    and hating this piece of crap  .

it is ok in a city    but    buy the garmin nuvi if you want an inexpensive gps system  .

i previously had a maestro 3225 which died after 2 months (screen would lock up , then test patterns on screen)  .

after speaking with magellan's tech support they wanted me to ship the device to them (at my cost) and then they would not send it back for a month  .

luckily i is able to return the unit for a full refund to the store i bought it at since i actually liked the unit when it worked and figured every manufacturer has a few lemons here and there , i decided to purchase a 4250  .

i is happy with it at first , it has a good sized screen , good aaa features (a bonus for me as i'm a aaa subscriber) , i is already used to the interface , i liked the bluetooth phone dialing although my phone could not dial numbers from poi database as they contain dashes (that's more of a problem with my lg cu550 phone than the maestro though)  .

after the first day of use when i tried to power on the unit it would get stuck at the maestro splash screen , the loading bar fills up but then hangs  .

i tried multiple reboots and used the reset button also to no avail  .

i called their tech support again and is pretty much told to do the same things i had already tried (power on and off the unit , press the reset button)  .

i got the same instructions as before , send in the unit for a month needless to say i'm very disappointed in both the reliability of these maestros and the level of support (i paid for these units , why should i have to be without it for a month while they fix it  .

i will be returning this unit and i will not be purchasing any more magellan products in the future .

i have used the magellan 4250 for 10 weeks , and thanks to costco's 90    day return policy , this gps is going back first , routing is usually good , but intermittently a disaster  .

it has on multiple occasions tried to turn a trip of 160 miles into 300 and an 80 mile trip in to 240  .

these were trips in different states , so it's not just a local mapping error it sends you beyond the proper exit on the interstate , adds another segment of the trip in the same direction , then back the other direction    too far again , then back off the correct exit  .

if i hadn't known roughly where i is going , and had just followed the gps instructions , i would have wasted a lot of time and gas further , if you have the misfortune to cross the canadian border , and attempt to enter a canadian address from the us database , the unit locks up  .

multiple resets alone don't work  .

it requires some magical combination of resets and power switch presses to get it back and the power switch is nearly inoperable  .

the only way it turns on with some reliability is to leave it plugged in to the lighter socket and hope that it recognizes that the car has been started  .

often , it gets stuck in the legalspeak screen , and even the reset button won't get it to power up this is a known issue , and my inquiry to magellan first got a boilerplate non    answer  .

my follow    up inquiry has been unanswered for about 8 weeks the conventional wisdom i've gleaned from reading other commentaries is that the power glitches are a windows ce feature  .

if this is the case , magellan needs to implement a different platform post haste  .

if you cannot even get your machine to turn on reliable , you really have a serious issue this is only an annoyance , but it often takes different routes to the same place  .

different exits off the interstate  .

different local roads the voice recognition is a great feature that has a near    useless implementation  .

it does recognize my voice while driving in a not    very    quiet minivan  .

but the menu of commands is so limited that it defies logic  .

for example , voice dialing for the phone would have been great  .

as would commands like zoom the bluetooth recognition of the cell phone is ok  .

i have to pair my phone every time    an automatic pairing would be so much nicer  .

the speakerphone feature is nicely done for what it's worth , i wo not bother with the traffic receiver again  .

this is not magellan's fault    the data come from an outside provider  .

but i have too often been in stopped highway traffic with no indication of a problem on the gps traffic alert  .

i have also gone through areas with an alert showing slow traffic , with no actual problem  .

in my experience , the data is so unreliable that it has no real value i bought the magellan unit because of positive experience with the hertz neverlost system over many years  .

this unit has proved to be a massive disappointment .

i bought this gps by reading great specification even though i read that it has average reviews  .

i bought a refurb model from amazon , i called magellan cust  .

ser  .

to make sure that it has most recent maps on it instead of talking about map , they asked me to update the software , while doing that the gps got hang  .

i had to return that one and amazon happily sent me another piece when i received the another piece i did the same thing again , called the customer service to find out if this one (i read in the user reviews that they never give you most recent maps) and i is told that the most updated maps they have is 2007 which is loaded on this one  .

if you want you can buy spring 2009  .

technically i bought this gps in nov 09 ; i thought it should either have the most recent map or i should receive the free map update , which they did not give me  .

rather , they gave me an option that if you want you can buy spring 09 updated map for 79$ ridiculous even if i have 2007 preloaded maps , it would not detect some of the addresses older than 2007  .

i called them but they always have human robots on the other end who will keep giving you endless excuses and ridiculous arguments  .

sometimes they literally sounded like recorded message the routs that gps would find me were also bit weird  .

points of interests are completely outdated  .

if you are planning to buy it for pois then you may get disappointed  .

there were delays in service sometimes where basically it would tell me to turn when i already passed it or very short notice to turn , but this happened only few times mainly in countryside areas overall feel of the gps is very good , looks great but if the performance is not good it  .

s useless to me  .

bluetooth is just there for function , it  .

s not good enough to use because every time i tried calling through bluetooth , the other person will have a real hard time listening to me and i will have to switch back to my normal phone mode  .

it is not at all comparable to the built in bluetooth of car audios  .

there are limited functions on the gps compared to other competitors voice command is limited too ; you cannot type in addresses by voice command  .

my voice command stopped working after updating the software  .

when contacted magellan how to fix it they said you will get it back when updating the next version of software which apparently they did not know when is coming out overall , it could have been a good gps if the performance is good and customer service is lot better  .

you can  .

t be satisfied just because it has good looks  .

after getting disanointed with magellan customer service , i returned the unit after 3 months , even though amazon would not refund me full amount because it is more than 30 days  .

in future i will try some other brand but not magellan .

the unit frequently freezes up , requiring rebooting  .

in the middle of a trip it can suddenly stop and demand that you speak a command for it to continue , or it can decide to change from the map to a turn list  .

it comes with 3 months of traffic alerts  .

when i attempted to activate it , i found that i needed a firmare update which could only be obtained through windows vista (not xp)  .

although the package indicates that windows xp is required , nowhere in their advertising or their product information on their website does it indicate this fact  .

mail order purchasers find out only after they have purchased it , that it will not work with a macintosh computer  .

the cd packed with the unit has a section for mac users , but nowhere does it state that you cannot use it with a mac  .

their less than helpful outsourced tech support that this information is available on their fac list  .

probably the only good feature of this device is that it makes a ding sound when you are at an intersection where you have to do something .

i've returned the unit for service and the unit sent back to me is equally slow  .

factory tells me it is the high buildings in seattle  .

wonder how long it takes in ny  .

regardless of my location    city or flat land , 7 minutes is the average for the unit to stark working  .

that's a long time to wait considering the initial cost of the unit  .

do not recommend  .

i like the size and ease of use  .

it is easy to see in the car  .

i do not like that i have only had the unit less than 2 months , planning a trip and now i have to cancel because it will not work and i have to send it in and it may get replaced with a used unit  .

i paid 499  .

99 for the unit and now may get a used one  .

this does not seam right  .

i should have gone to best buy where i get my computers , printers , etc  .

i am very upset with magellan and do not like their policy of replacing new with used  .

also the fact that their product does not last longer than 2 months  .

if i could get my money back i would get something else .

this is a huge waste of money  .

i've had this unit for about two weeks  .

it always takes the longest route possible and sometimes even gets lost if i had not just purchased the unit i would throw it in the trash .

had three units , all had to be returned to costco (thanks for their return policy) all had the same problem small pixel size black spots appearing on the lcd after 3 or 4 days use  .

called tech support and is informed i could send it back for repair but the lcd is not covered by the warrantee  .

he then told me they have this problem a lot the support tech then advised me to return it to the store i bought it and exchange it  .

(fat chance  .

god forbid this unit should break or you should order an upgraded map and the disc doesn't work  .

my experience has been with the upgrade of the roadmate760 , otherwise the unit is fine  .

their policy is not to send you another disc rather send it to an outsourced tech facility in texas , where nothing will happen  .

oh , and do not bother calling their custoer support , that's been outsourced to india where they stick to their script and have no idea what you're talking about  .

if you have hours kill though , go nuts .

many problems i have had two of these new units both had many problems such as screen changing when nothing is pushed , routing would send you miles out of the way or be just wrong , it would tell you destination on left when it is on the right  .

many more problems spent several hours with tech support useless wanted me to send in again for repair best bet i heard the garmin nuvi 760 actually works  .

i have asked for my money back from magellan but they so far have refused and do not care that they are putting their customers out and waisting their time  .

this unit , if they ever quit lying and get it fixed might be a decent unit but not now as of jan 27 , 2008  .

after registering for the free 3 month traffic data subscription that comes with the unit , i is able t confirm that the subscription is effectively activated , but no traffc data could be accessed on the unit  .

customer service       by way of india       is unable to resolve the issue  .

they set my a new traffic subscription kit , which did not resolve te issue  .

after another 3 minutes on hold with customer service , i packed the unit up and am returning it  .

magellan left a very bad taste in this consumer's mouth  .

buyer beware .
