$$;
Pros:. I love the fact that it comes with the latest map feature that allows you to download the newest available map within 30 days of activating your TomTom. Plus the 4.3 inch screen is HUGE.. 
Cons:. Bluetooth is not compatible with all Verizon phones. Route calculation takes a bit longer than my old GPS.. 
Summary:. This is my second GPS device, I got it refurbished and the thing looks and works like new. I would give this device six stars if I could. I had a minor problem with the map update and customer support was friendly and helped me out well. The unit is accurate to within an average of 25 feet and has a great poi database. It locks in one satellites in about 20 seconds from a cold start and about 5-10 seconds if you have been using it. As I said above the route calculation takes a bit longer than my old system, but I have found its routing to be far better than I have experienced in the past and the ability travel via a certain location is a BIG plus. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone looking for a GPS.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use.. not to expensive..can take you anywhere. 
Cons:. Can't always find the closest krispy kreme doughnuts but I am still workin on that. 
Summary:. I really like this device. It is just what I wanted. Everytime I get in my car the tom tom goes with me. Used it all over christmas break it made traveling to see my friends a piece of cake.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not too complicated, worked perfectly out of the box, shoped around for 2 weeks. I bought it off ebay for $249.99+S&#38;H. 
Cons:. The mounts are not very good, TomTom promotes their accessories. I bought a PRO CLIP and is securely mounted in my Mini.. 
Summary:. Just a nice simple product, works well even laying in my seat. I have a large sunroof, which allows the gps signal another avenue to reach the receiver. I was amazed on my 1st trip, it told I had reach my destination, right in front of my office.. 

$$;
Pros:. it does what it's supposed to do. 
Cons:. none that I know of. 
Summary:. I used this little gadget to get me home from Catskill, NY to the hills of WV.. Programing it was a little time consuming, but that's just me; I am intimiated when it comes to learning to program electronics.. Once I got the hang of what buttons to push (and which ones not too), I was good to go! Even though I had to go off my route to fill up at the gas station, TomTom got me right on track immediately to my destination.. I can't wait to take another trip with my buddy! Love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use. 
Cons:. Does not find everything i want...lol.... 
Summary:. WE have become so dependant on our Tom Tom, we don't leave home with out it, not even to go to the gas station lol... We travel a lot with out work(about 70,000 miles a year) and Tom Tom paid for its self on our first trip with it. Some times we have multipal locations to go to so the routing feature is great.... 

$$;
Pros:. Memory upgradable, features being added regularly with firmware updates (like Mapshare). 
Cons:. bluetooth can't be used for handsfree calls.. 
Summary:. I got this refurbished for $130 +free shipping. I love using celebrity voices for the navigation, it's great because there are a lot of free ones. I've added a mediaplayer (for photos, music, and videos) and changed the blue arrow to a car icon. I'm still learning since I've only had it for a few days. There are a lot of hidden features you can add if you know where to look. Check out the tomtom forums for ideas.. On top of that it works well as a GPS, for when you need one of those. My wife had no trouble using it right out of the box without a tutorial. Pretty impressive considering she usually takes a while to warm up to technology.. As a GPS it overestimates how long it takes to get to a destination, not by a lot usually. If it estimates a route to take an hour then you'll be there in less than 50 minutes. It has no problems recalculating directions if you turn off the beaten path. I'm very happy with this unit especially with the price I paid.. 

$$;
Pros:. I read above that they had no texty to speech, well not sure about them, but mine does, I use the tomtom home program on my laptop to keep everything updated and in sync. being able to upload mistakes. 
Cons:. speak up a bit earlier at turns.. 
Summary:. I think its one of the best, I have a few of them, I like to play with the pda versions as well, iGuidence 4.0 is one of my favs for a pda. I have run them both with my tomtom xl and found that they are both very acurate , the trip calculations, speed and other estiments are very good. I have several bluetooth gps as well, my fav is the tom tom and i-blue 747 racing gps.. 

$$;
Pros:. map correction and accuracy. 
Cons:. GPS mount is kinda weak. 
Summary:. this is not my first GPS and had it for more than a year and this thing is for me very impressive! from where I bought it I used it right away (out of the box) it found my home which is a month old! newly develop area here in WA State which my friends garmin and magellan GPS cant find (had theirs for a while &#38; updated) I pretty much use mine everyday use, POI, and address finder. You've got to love this option only in TomTom the MAP CORRECTION which by the way I use most of the time in places name, address, and contact number. Specially now theres a lot of new road popping out here and there. I'll recommend this product to new user it's one of the easiest GPS to use out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Long battery life. 
Cons:. It doesn't take the shortest route.. 
Summary:. This is my very first GPS and was bought for me as a present. It has daytime/nighttime features which are great. It talks to you very clearly. Everthing is precise &#38; accurate. I highly recommend this item.. 

$$;
Pros:. TomTom won: Maps, signal acquisition time, recalculation time. 
Cons:. Garmin was too slow. 
Summary:. I borrowed a friend's Garmin Nuvi 360 for a weekend. I later borrowed a friend's TomTom One XL. At the end of day (actually, at the end of two weekends... ha ha), I greatly preferred the TomTom.. The Garmin took too long to acquire the necessary tracking signal (maybe 30+ seconds), and too long to recalculate a new route (maybe 10 seconds) if I "missed" my turn. I very intentionally tried to NOT take the turns it told me to take, just to see how it would handle recalculations.. TomTom acquired a signal within 10 seconds of turning it on. And it recalculated a new route within 5 seconds.. Garmin would say, "Recalculating." TomTom would just shut-up and do it. I liked TomTom for this.. Several reviews sing the praises of the text-to-speech feature (the Garmin had it; the TomTom did not). I found this feature to be insignificant. TomTom clearly told me, "In 100 yards, turn right" (for example). I could easily see on the display where to turn, and the street's name. I did not need the unit to say, "In 100 yards, turn right at Okemos Road" (which it really butchered anyway because Okemos is a local Indian name in Michigan, and no unit can handle some of our names... try Michilimackinac on for size, then get back to me).. Also, I thought TomTom's maps were easier to read. I also thought TomTom labelled EVERY cross street as I approached and passed it. Garmin showed the cross street, but didn't label it unless it was a major street.. I ordered a TomTom One XL for myself yesterday.. I'm Alexander Zkczyk, and I approved this message.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wider screen, same ease of use. 
Cons:. slightly heavier. 
Summary:. I had absolutely no problems setting this up and love the wider screen. I initially used a tomtom one but gave it to my girlfriend so i could use this one. The wider screen is great for me, and it's still as easy to use as the tomtom ONE was.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, accurate, large screen. 
Cons:. short battery life. 
Summary:. I've been using the ONE XL for a few months now and it have proven to be a quality device. It is very easy to use and imputing a destination is very easy. I've used it on a few long road trips and it has worked great, but when it really become handy is when I'm looking for a specific restaurant in an unfamiliar area. The POI's are so easy to use and work great I'm able to find exactly where I want to go. It's been a lifesaver a few times now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bigger Screen, Speaker is loud and Clear, Does not Lag, Rerouting is fast. 
Cons:. Bluetooth can't be used for hands-free, Traffic not currently availble for US. 
Summary:. I returned my Magellan 3100 because the nav position kept lagging, and the rerouting was atrocious so I got the TOMTOM One XL. Just to clarify Im a noobi at this GPS stuff. Comparing the TOMTOM to the Magellan 3100. The tomtom works awesome, its ready to use out of the box, comes preloaded with US and Canada maps, the screen is bigger, it never lagged, its very fast at rerouting. Touch screen works great. Map zooms in and out automatically when needed while going to your route.. The only dissappointing thing I have to mention is that it does NOT have handsfree bluetooth, otherwise it would have been a perfect 10.. Im debating if I should exchange it for a Garmin 580 which has handsfree. But its hard to give up because the TOMTOM ONE XL just works so well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size and readability, ease of use and features. 
Cons:. Traffic services not available for USA. 
Summary:. The One XL expands on its older and simpler sibling, the TomTom One by increasing the screen size from 3.5 inches to 4.3 inches and providing built-in storage that is more than adequate for all of the maps and POI's. The unit also comes preloaded maps of North America, millions of points of interest, 2D and 3D maps, text- and voice-guided directions, and integrated Bluetooth 2.0 to access TomTom's PLUS services via your Bluetooth-enabled phone. You can create up to 48 new favorites and a huge number of additional POI's. I was impressed with the accuracy of POI's, routes, and maps. The wide screen is much easier to navigate. So far I have not needed a S/D card and probably won't. The screen is acceptable in bright sunlight and menus easy to negotiate.. TomTom's PLUS features are available by installing a CD to connect to the Internet PLUS services. Many features are free that others provide only for a charge. I had only one disappointment, which is the support for real-time traffic services, is not available for the USA. The TomTom One-XL is available for a very reasonable $399.95 and compares with other GPS devices priced at $900.00.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent directions. Clear display. Perfect sound. Helps monitor speed. Works great even on cloudy days.. 
Cons:. Uses older maps. New toll ways not included. Needs expanded POI by type.. 
Summary:. This thing rocks.. I don't get the bashing.. Maybe it's because I'm new to the GPS thing, but, this awesome piece of technology that has gotten me where I want to go in 3 states. Small towns in Illinois, back roads in Kansas, Ozarks in Missouri.. I've only gotten 1 bad (wrong) direction in the 2 or 3 hundred directions I've needed.. That's pretty solid for the price.. Doesn't have the toll way by my house that's OK because it lets me maneuver backroads like a local.. A friend of mine has a Garmin. I feel bad for him, because after seeing how my low-end TOM TOM does. I don't think he's as impressed with his GPS anymore.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's an out of the box fully preloaded unit. There is no purchase cost included for additional software. Within five minutes of taking the Tomtom one XL out of the box, it's up and running with all features operational.. 
Cons:. The suction cup mounts needs a very clean &#38; perfectly flat surface to adhere to. As a portable unit, the 2 hour life span of the battery can be a drawback. Shop around for these units because their price range can vary by more than $100.00 or more.. 
Summary:. Our two Tomtom GPS units have served us remarkably well. We had our unit up and running in our vehicle five minutes after taking it out of the box and mounting it on the dashboard. All the programming for the unit was all there for us and ready to use. For pure navigation abilities both our XL and XL.S GPS units have worked far beyond what we expected. Free updates are readily available from Tomtom?s website. The 4?X3? monitor is very bright and easy to read even in full sun glare. The programming icons are large and easy to read &#38; use while driving; which is a huge bonus for us.. Updated. on Mar 20, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Large easy to read screen, computer daily dwnloads, price, accuracy, easy to understand speech, fast GPS pickup, Easy to read maps and good map color choices, nice volume &#38; touch screen. 
Cons:. Customer support by phone is inconsistent, destination is abit off - sometimes and only by 50-100 feet.. 
Summary:. First, I have a model XL-S. But I think the differences are *very* slight between my model and the XL. I have had two other units, including some brands named by other reviewers here who wrote about the TomTom XL and compared them.. I live in a city of about metro 700,000. I use the latest USA-Canada map. Alot of new developments and new roads. I travel in the city mostly, but have also tried it out of town. I have found it to be very good to find POI's, "Favorites" and destinations once entered. It re-directs and recalculates well, and has very easy to understand speech. Gives me adequate speech notice before turns and other directions. I did go online to a site that specializes in selling quality GPS accessories "cheaply" and got an external antenna. Cost me $20. Well worth it and very easy to use of course. It helps GPS speed I am sure. But it worked fine for 2 weeks before I got the antenna.. Yes, it makes a mistake off and on, but usually that is map error related, and realistically they can only update the maps for everyone so often. Actually the GPS "quick fixes" to tell where the satellites will be for the next 7 days and the daily (or almost daily) shared map updates are fine. And free!. The people who have their units working so terribly either have a bad unit, in which case all the more reason to use the warranty and get an exchange or repair, or something else signal wise is messing things up I would guess. I have four friends with TomTom XL and XL-S's like mine and they are all very happy. They do agree with me that Customer Support needs to hire and train more people, but I have never had a "rude" person (quite patient and pleasant always) and when writing them I have always heard back in email within 1-2 days.. Some people want a "10/10" (read as perfect) in a product, and with electronics, after having computers and expensive "gadgets" for 30+ years, I have NEVER owned anything very sophisticated that did not have some flaw or mild irritation. If it was a BIG flaw or irritation, I got a refund or exchange for a new one, and did not whine about it and make people think just because the device had some bugs with me that it was worthless or "garbage" or other terms I have read in some of these reviews.. If you want fighter plane or military GPS quality and accuracy, I guess you need to do your travel by fighter jet or other military transport. These are made for civilians to help them more easily get where they want to go the best way they can. From my experiences and my friends, this does a very good job most of the time in a easy to read and understand manner. And it is not perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. User Friendly, Easy To Read. 
Cons:. Some obvious features left out, Limited customizability. 
Summary:. I bought this unit as my first car-navigation GPS; however, I have been using GPS for years in many different applications. This is- by far- the simplest GPS I have ever used. Excellent reception/accuracy, Windows and Macintosh compatible, large screen, and good price ($200 at Best Buy) are all good. It's routing engine is only average, but re-routing is no problem. Other features, such as subscription based traffic and weather updates are nice if you don't mind the monthly fee. However, this GPS doesn't quite take advantage of its full potential when it comes to customizing and searching POIs. POIs such as restaurants are not categorized by type (i.e. Chinese, Italian, etc.) which is a surprising oversight. You can't load music or use it as a hands-free for your bluetooth phone, even though it has bluetooth and plenty of memory. These are features that could (read: should) be incorporated in the unit. The "more advanced" GPS units from TomTom do have these features. Bottom line: You get what you pay for with this unit. If you are buying this because you get lost a lot, you like to know what's around you, or you simply want a navigation system that's easy to use then it's a good buy. If you want the extra whiz-bang features, then look elsewhere.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large touch screen, easy to use, many Points of Interest. 
Cons:. Did not find any. 
Summary:. This has been my 3rd purchase of a GPS. I find it very easy to operate. It has clear instructions as well as so many personalized features. You can even change the voice that gives you the directions. I made a wrong turn and it recalculated my route. I did my research as usual and I have found the lowest price at SDCommodities.com. Before I made the actual sale with them I called many times to ask several questions which they answered (this was also very helpful). Anyway do not just take my word for it, purchase the Tom Tom One Xl and then you will see for yourself!! TomTom also gives a 2 year warranty which is good too. I called Tom Tom and their customer service is excellent as well, buy this unit, you will not be sorry.. 

$$;
Pros:. Acurate, fast routing/re-routing, easy to use. 
Cons:. Maps a little out of date, HOWEVER i'd say two three years tops. 
Summary:. I am in logistics, here in beautiful Colorado. I spend a great deal of time on the road going to unfamilure places. And allthough i've only had my XL for a few days now I must say I am impressed. This unit works well, and id call it dependable.. The only thing i've seen that would be a possible con was the maps not being totaly up to date.. Looking for a seafood place to eat, we picked one from the POI list and the XL maped out eveything, once we were within sight of the resturant opon making the final turn the XL got a little mixed up Saying somthing about an "Unknown" street although we were in the parking lot. So I guess we can call it a wash. Id buy the product again. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use, especially after 4 or 5 years with a Garmin.. 
Cons:. It routinely hides the path to some of its functions; deletions, for example. That is somewhat annoying, and can see no real purpose for it.. 
Summary:. Just got the One XL three days ago. Bought 80 bucks worth of map updates; I am supposed to be up to date with all available US &#38; Canada maps. Went out today on an major addition to a nearby major highway which was opened to traffic over a year ago. One XL didn't recognize the more than one year old highway. However, it's features are easy to use, and its navigation route can be affected by the user (eg: don't take this highway, find an alternative route). I don't yet know how out of date its maps are in fact, but this first trip doesn't bode well.. 

$$;
Pros:. big screeen, online updates and extras, diff voices. 
Cons:. limited verbal navigation. 
Summary:. I have a Magellan 3225 also...bought this one because Magellan online cust svc is a joke; however the navigation help is better..Mag. warns several times ten dings when you're at next turn, reads street names and uses miles for measurement. ( i.e. turn left in .1 miles). It has frequent lags in figuring out where you are. Maps are Nov '07 with no way to update as of yet.. TomTom has some neat features:. online updates. diff voices. spots speed-trap cameras. ability for you to contribute and recieve updates from users who've been there. and multi-destination itinerary planing. and some things I'll probably never use:bluetooth, traffic. In simple directions, I do miss the (good job) ding after a turn, the frequent reminders in MILES as you go-. Can't decide if I'll keep this and give Magellan away or vice-versa.. Both wer bought a great discount price of $159 ( one at Bj's, the other at CompUsa). Think I'll use TomTom 1 xl for another couple weeks and then decide. If TomTom had those 2 little features ( text2speach and instructions in miles ( not 400 yards but rather .1 miles) it'd be no question. I'm also undecided which interface I prefer...Magellan is clean and simple - TomTom may have a little too much info in the bottom.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to use. 
Cons:. Touch screen can be... touchy. 
Summary:. I used it in Europe with great ease and very good accuracy. When you don't follow the advice it recalculate the new itinerary pretty quickly and accurately. I didn't find the itinerary option. Only the touch screen seemed pretty touchy at time. the machine seem to freeze a few times. Entering a destination can also be hard at time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy controls,good graphics,sound,&#38;support.. 
Cons:. Inaccurate with street addresses; itineray planning of alternate routes a problem. 
Summary:. Device graphics are clear and EZ to read in dark or sunlight.Voice directions are clear and sufficiently loud. Routes are easily inserted or deleted by a responsive touch screen on the fly. Rerouting is quick. Satellite acquisition takes a few minutes (2-3) the first time in a locale, then quicker.Itinerary plannning is rich. Unhappily it is very difficult to alter a route. If one attempts to reroute by using a "point on the map" the system will insert a map of the Home area instead of the area being altered. This is especially a problem if one is traveling,( or planning an itinerary) in a state other than one's home state. The other major flaw is inaccurate or absent ability to navigate to a residential address. The voice guidance will say " take a left onto X street; and then " you have reached your destination." The graphic then ends at the beginning of the street or 200' or more from the actual site. Customer support is prompt, friendly and earnest. The window mount is sturdy.. The inaccurate address navigation is the major flaw.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Easy to update. Quick recalculation of routes. Inexpensive.. 
Cons:. Lacks text to speech functionality.. 
Summary:. I am starting to question the validity and merit of cnet reviews. The Tom Tom One XL doesn't have hands free calling? Ummm, did you guys actually review the correct device? The only thing that this system lacks is a useless media player and text to speech. For the price, it sure does a lot. Oh well, at least it is nice to see videos of new devices, but cnet...you guys need to be on top of things. You have millions of viewers and people are going out to devices based on your opinion. Well, shame on us for being so gullible.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent reception in my location (SF Bay area), easy to use. 
Cons:. Unnecessarily long routes, no U-turns, no speed limits, inaccurate maps, terrible pronunciation, doesn't speak street names at turns.. 
Summary:. Will take you way out-of-the-way on a long route when a left turn or U-turn will take you right to the spot. It almost never allows U-turns, an essential in CA. It doesn't seem to post Speed Limits. It never speaks the Street Names at turns, it just says "turn right." Terrible pronunciation, but that seems to go for all gps units. Will warn you if you surpass the speed limit but no setting for 5 or 10 mph over the speed limit. Maps are inacurrate. Is there any GPS that gets it all right?. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the large screen size and availability of getting updated map info from other TomTom customers. Able to download specific POI's and voices.. 
Cons:. Battery life is only about 2 hrs. Info from POI it takes several steps to tell what the bus. name is. The fastest route it does not take into consideration traffic lights. Takes time to key in destinations and touch keys are a little small.. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS and I have been happy with it so far. Good entry level.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very user friendly, very accurate.. 
Cons:. Hard to read screen in direct sun when my convertible top is down, volume quality is poor when turned up to the maximum, does not alert which side of the road your destination is on, lane advice could be much better.. 
Summary:. I don't reget buying this unit, but I'm now ready for a much more advanced system.. 

$$;
Pros:. helpful with directions. 
Cons:. takes you out of your way. 
Summary:. Manufacturer is aware of "smoking" problem. They don't think its a big deal as they know of no injuries. Once it smokes, your computer chip is fried. They offerred to fix it. They should fix the known problem--before someone gets hurt.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen, good audio with digital voices,. 
Cons:. poor routing, terrible customer service, bad battery life, maps not that accurate.. 
Summary:. I received one about a year ago as a gift and the battery has gone flat already. I contacted customer service and found the website very confusing and hard to navigate. Finally, the answer is that "too old, too bad, we don't replace batteries". Not really a good answer. I found another battery on ebay and will replace it but NO MORE TOMTOM's for me. Go with a garmin.. 

$$;
Pros:. it was very user friendly; several funny voices directing you to choose from. 
Cons:. not sleek; the suction cup constantly dropped the device onto the floor by my feet while driving OR out the door when the door was open causing the front to get scratched by the parking lot;. 
Summary:. I will never buy TomTom again due to it not working after 2 years. I have left it in my house a majority of its life (so it wasn't in extreme heat or cold) but somehow it won't turn on. Vertical lines appeared one day and then it just quit working. Thanks TomTom. IT QUIT WORKING IN JUNE 2009 and was purchased JUNE 2007 - out of $300 after only 2 years of use.... 

$$;
Pros:. good packaging design, friendly user. 
Cons:. not accurate in selction of routing road, confuse voice guidant, not text to speed. 
Summary:. Just got a Tomtom one XL. It is OK interm of signal reception. The big upset are. - Very confuse guide voice. Voice " keep left" means go straight on freeway.. Turn left or turn right are very confusing alot of time driver will make an early turn or miss the turn. There is not text to speed to support what is the name of the street driver should turn.. - Road calculation algorithm sometime are very confusing. It choose a longer road instead of a short one even shortest road plan option were selected.. With price range 350 dollars you could get a better GPS than Tomtom one XL. 

$$;
Pros:. It works untill I update, then it ruins my life.. 
Cons:. purchased map updates and updates ALWAYS destroys my saved addresses and puts me in Guam. Backup does not work, as well as Restore. It take about 6 hours to fix everything, then the next map update wipes my addresses and puts me back in Guam.. 
Summary:. purchased map updates and updates ALWAYS destroys my saved addresses and puts me in Guam. Backup does not work, as well as Restore. It take about 6 hours to fix everything, then the next map update wipes my addresses and puts me back in Guam. You cannot respond to their emails, which are often all in upper case, cause I think they are in the third grade. Real unhappy here. Do not buy one of these.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast, responsive. 
Cons:. outdated maps with purchase and would not accept my free access code for free most recent update; bought from Overstock.com; sending back. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice big screen, clear maps,. 
Cons:. Flaws in manufacturing, appalling after-sales service, odd fault in maps. 
Summary:. I bought the TomTom in Europe while I was on holiday for 3 months. I had the use of it for about 4 weeks of that time. The rest of the time it was 'being repaired.'. When it worked it was pretty good. The screen was nice and big and the maps were clear. There were the usual issues adjusting to the instructions and to the display:and occasionally the update lag made it difficult to respond in time to an instruction. The maps were generally very accurate but there were some odd glitches. On one occasion TomTom kept telling me to jump off an overpass onto a motorway. Overall the product was useful and userfriendly.. However, in the unit I bought there was a fault in the cabling. After about 4 weeks use the fault caused a short circuit in the device and that was when the real dramas began.. TomTom's 'customer contact' processes actively discourage customer contact and make it very difficult to talk to someone about the problems. You can't send e-mails; the web-page message system defaults to not sending any messages even when you think you have sent one; and now I'm back in Australia there is no longer an Australian phone number I can ring.. TomTom advertise that repairs will normally be completed within 10 working days. The first time mine went in for repairs it took 15 working days for it to be repaired.. TomTom refused to send the device anywhere except the pick-up address, so I had to travel 800 Kms to go back to the hotel where we'd stayed. I wasn't too pleased to have to wait another week in a location I'd already visited. Nevertheless I was really pleased to get the TomTom back and started it up as soon as I could.. It worked for 10 minutes.. We tried to negotiate a replacement or a refund to no avail so we arranged for the faulty device to be picked up for repair again. We also pointed out that we were leaving for Australia in 3 weeks and were assured the device would be returned before we left.. It wasn't.. Two days before we left Europe we rang up , explained the situation and were promised the repaired device would be sent to our address in Australia.. It wasn't.. When we finally (5 weeks after our return) got a reply to our messages, we were told TomTom would not send the device to us in Australia. They then sent it to the address we had stayed at in the UK when we first purchased the device.. My experiences may have been an isolated one but prospective buyers should be wary of reliability: and should be aware that the after-sales service is appalling.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wide screen, ok info on map screen, pretty fast routing. 
Cons:. Cant turn off auto zoom. Company was horrible cust serv. To many menus to navigate. 
Summary:. This is my 4th GPS so i know by now what i want in one. This is not it. Will be returning it tomorrow and paying Circut City there 15% restocking fee ($52) to get ride of this.. Main problem...Cant turn off auto zoom. If your using your map, lets say in NYC and its showing you a 1 mile area and you press the + to zoom in a few times and now you see 4 city blocks, a few seconds later it zooms back out to the 1 mile view. I WANT to see the immediate area i am in, well Too bad for me, i can see it just for a few seconds that it will TELL ME what zoom i have to be at. Called CRAPCRAP (woops, mean tomtom) and they said all the units are like that. I asked if i could exchange it for a higher end unit as i didnt like the graphics quality either, she asked where i got it and when i said Circut City, she said "You should have bought it from us online, there is nothing i can do" then slightly rude "anything else" to imply 'get off the phone'. I ten bought a Garmen Nuvi 350...go read that one, better but still flawed. Recommend the Lowrance iway 500c, BIG sucker, 5lbs, has a full size hard drive in it. Go read my review on that...worth it..

Pros:. Simple device; better styling than previous TomToms. 
Cons:. No wow features and the same 'ol GPS experience. No text to speech and the Bluetooth is not for calling - for data plans you pay extra for. 
Summary:. I bought the TomTom One XL a few months ago and I am not impressed. I like to have the latest tech toys and like some cool features. If you are like me, the One XL is not for you. It is about as vanilla as you can get. I am getting a bit tired with GPS devices at this point. No one is coming out with anything new. Same old devices with basic routing that are dumbed down. Even the maps are a bit cartoony. From what I found Garmin devices are not much more enjoyable. If you want a simple device without a lot of "wow" the One XOL is for you. When is someone going to offer something more with GPS? CB.

Pros:. Nice large touch screen, clear graphics. 
Cons:. Dreadful journey time estimations, position errors, poor customer service, website crashes, must have internet connection to get all the features available.. 
Summary:. On opening the box to my new One XL I was impressed. It has a nice big screen, the software is all pre-installed and you simply turn it on and go  excellent& or so I thought. After a few journeys it became apparent that the unit is awful.. I need 3 things from a GPS: I need to know how to get to a destination, how long (roughly) that will take me, and when I am going to arrive. From that information I can work out when I need to start a journey to be at the destination at the required time  simple.. The unit I purchased in Jan 2008, from a Future Shop, in Canada, came with a pre-installed USA/Canada map. The first thing I noticed when I was driving around town was that the unit would regularly jump to show my apparent position on a parallel street, with the associated turn left/right commands to get me back on track. When driving out of town, on the highway, the TomTom often showed me off the side of the road by up to 100m in the undergrowth. Now, instead of showing me the distance to the next turn point, which would be in several tens of miles time, the TomTom continuously tells me to turn left, turn left, as it attempts to navigate me from the undergrowth back onto the main highway. All meaningful navigation data is therefore lost for this period.. Another major problem I discovered was that the calculated time to complete a journey is hopelessly inaccurate. I am currently living in Alberta and to complete a 300km journey on a 110kph road the TomTom estimates the journey will take 5 hrs and 43 minutes; the journey actually takes approx 3hrs and 30 minutes. I also have a PDA with TomTom software which is configured for the UK, and there is a menu which allows you to change the planning assumptions. For example, if the unit plans on an average speed of 60 kph on highways you can change it to use 85 kph if this is more realistic. This will enable the unit to give a more accurate estimated arrive time for your particular driving style  which is still well within the legal speed limit!! (This point is relevant later). Sadly, with the One XL, there is no such facility to change the planning assumptions and therefore the time to complete the journey &#38; Arrival time are worthless digits cluttering up the display because they over estimate the journey time by approx 175%.. I attempted to work through these problems for 3 months, thinking that perhaps there were localized mapping errors in Alberta that were causing the problems. Unfortunately, having used the unit elsewhere in both the US and Canada I found that the problems were more widely spread.. I contacted customer service, via their website and notified them that I was very unhappy with my purchase, which was actually my 3rd TomTom product (PDA nav and another One XL for a friend in the UK). My complains were that it spent far too much time dealing with spurious position error whilst attempting to navigate me back on track, and that it was useless as a tool to work out how long a journey would take me to complete.. Initially, customer services were good and responded to my e-mail apparently genuinely concerned with my problems. They sent a software update and also showed me how to reconfigure the GPS position. This I did with no effect. I compared my GPS position with that of a hand held hiking GPS and the positions were within 10 meters, thus showing that the problem was with the TomTom mapping data, not the unit. At this point the TomTom website crashed and it became impossible to communicate with customer services by e-mail.. Today I phoned the customer services dept to get the problems fixed. The first representative cut me off, accidentally. The second just became very defensive (I was being very polite at this stage) and told me that my maps were VERY VERY old& yet I bought the unit 3 months ago! She then explained that when you buy a TomTom you have 30 days to download the latest map, yet this was written nowhere in the enclosed instructions. Since I had failed to do that I would have to pay for a new map at $100 plus tax.. On the point of arrival time she simply said, dont worry about that time Sir, you can ignore that&! But I dont want to ignore it, I want it to give me a realistic number. Yes, but at TomTom we make all our calculations based on safety and we cant factor in that you will be breaking the speed limit& so they estimate an average speed of approx 60kph on a 110kph road&for safety? OK&???!. The she asked me how I plan, I said Fastest route. NO SIR, we DO NOT recommend that you do that, you should always plan the QUICKEST route, errr, what is the difference between quickest and fastest? We had a quick discussion about the English language and the conversation went rapidly downhill because I cannot stand people trying to bullsh*t me and baffle me with science.. What I didnt mention to TomTom is that I am a fighter pilot and I work with GPS navigation systems all day. I know when a system is working, I know when one isnt. The TomTom One XL that I own has a 75 meter East mapping-data error and a poor algorithm to calculate journey times. It spends most of its time giving erroneous navigation data, is unable to accurately calculate journey times and therefore cannot fulfil my 3 requirements from a system: I need to know how to get to a destination, how long (roughly) that will take me, and when I am going to arrive. I could spend a further $100 on a new map but who is to say it wont have the exact same datum error? Good money after bad.. Overall: Worthless, buy a Garmin, they work properly.. If you found this useful, please drop me an e-mail: Boycie@wide-boy.com. If you work for TomTom, please use the same e-mail in your system to find the customer that will never buy another one of your products again; you are foolish to think that poor products and poor customer service go unreported since the introduction of the internet.. 

$$;
Pros:. A thin unit that's easy to carry. 
Cons:. Much slower to receive signal that other units. 
Summary:. Not worth using, I travel a great deal on the east coast and find huge map errors in every city. Recently at South Miami Beach and Tom Tom said MIA was 23 miles and FFL was 4.7 miles. Often tells me to turn right when it should be left and always tells me yards to turn, as in 7 yards instead of the correct 7 miles.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface - lousy support. 
Cons:. No support for bugs, just buy $oftware/map updates. 
Summary:. I purchased a TomTom for my spouse in September 2007 - Used it three times. When it automaticlly selects a route it said that unpaved roads were part of the route, even though they weren't - contacted support and they informed me that an updated map is available for download for $79 and this will fix my problem - This is the answer to fix my problem - spend more money and hope I don't have another bug or that this will fix the bug I do have. FYI the new street/road on any of the routes is 8 years old.. 

$$;
Pros:. loud speaker, cool voices that are free. Thats it.. 
Cons:. Poor route planning, plans one way but can't seem to remember the reverse route, problems with maps, problems with battery life, problems with long GPS fix, problems inputting ANYTHING worthwile onto system as a favorite or POI.. 
Summary:. Garmin Nuvi series, like the 255w is BY FAR SUPERIOR to this device !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I HATE this GPS... I can't get rid of it fast enough!!! I'm going back to my Garmin. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much easier to use!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Was easy to use when it went on. 
Cons:. Only worked for one trip, Zero customer support after one year. Customer service said to reset it 3 times and if that doen't work."Thanks again for writing. At TomTom we believe in showing you the way the easy way." (actual customer service response). 
Summary:. Nice unit, terrible company with zero customer service after one year. Would not recommend to anyone.. Updated. on Jan 10, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. it turns on. 
Cons:. Bad Maps, avoids left turns - it will add 10 miles to avoid a left turn, no auto night setting, slow aquiring. 
Summary:. Horrible, really best for a novelty item. i've had this unit tell me I was there when i was within a football field of my destination.. Really - go for a Garmin. 

$$;
Pros:. ok maps I guess... 
Cons:. Reboots, Locks, Freezes, Poor GPS. 
Summary:. If you live in the BAY AREA: Do NOT buy this device. I don't know who came up with the brilliant idea to have the device reboot when GPS signal is lost (under an overpass for example), but that person should be fired immediately. We can not keep this device running for more than 5 minutes without it locking up or rebooting.. Horrible.. 

$$;
Pros:. wide screen. 
Cons:. Severly limited. No speaker phone(yet it has blue tooth) No mp3 player no audio out, No vids... everything is a plus service to the vendor.. 
Summary:. Severely disabled. GPS. Ok here it is. The tom tome one XL. I saw it at Frys right besides the Mio 520c.. Supposedly it has blue tooth and a whole bunch of goodies. Well nothing could be farther from the truth&. I purchased this unit because I thought it would be very reliable. The Tom Tom name and all that rot. I tested it on the way home and it seemed quite nice for navigation&I had set up a British female voice since I am a big fan of Dr Who and the BBC in general. The gps seemed up to date and very accurate. But when I looked up a POI it would not display the phone number like the Myguide I had from before that had been stolen.. It did however display the phone number on the overhead map and that required one to tap right on the item on the item(very hard to do if you are driving).. The blue tooth didnt work too well. THERE IS NO WAY TO USE THIS UNIT AS A HANDSFREE FOR A BLUE TOOTH ENABLED PHONE! NO WAY AT ALL. I DID TEST THE DATA PORTION AND IT DOES WORK. I was able to get weather&Traffic is a fee based service and you have to also have gprs Internet through your provider in addition.. The Unit comes with an sd card slot .When I put a card in it. The unit would give me an error. I tried multiple cards. It would seem that using the card slot is locked out unless you buy the Their software on sd card.. These units use Linux I am told yet every option the hard ware has is locked out. Why? Because TomTom wants to charge for everything.-. Everything that the TomTom one xl cant do the MIO 520c unit right beside it on the shelf can do and then some. The Mio can play any kind of video. I tested it on multiple different types. It plays Mp3s through mp3 headphones or the audio port. It connected to my razor phone smartly and I was able to dial and call pois I looked up&. I used the TomTom the last day I had it to try and get to my friends location. I used the poi look up and it found the muffler shop she was at. I router there and then tried to use the Gps to get to her. Well it routed me to the wrong address. And showed the shop right on the display. Now keep in mind I did an update the night before. SO it should be current. BUT IT TOOK ME THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO WHERE THE MUFFLER SHOP WAS!. I was not happy with the Tomtom. I contacted them and they gave me tons of cop-outs. They had lots of other excuses and told me what they cant do. My 200 dollar unit that was stolen by the neighbors had more ability. I say if you pay $400 for a gps it should have some functionality. I went back and got the Mio 520 c. it is a better unit and cost 42 dollars less.. Conclusion:. The TomTom is a gps made for Aolers and people who have no clue. There is a little Vtech laptop they used to sell at Wal-Mart that has more functionality than this GPS And for crying out loud they cant even make a device that is orthogonal. I cant lay it flat on my desk. The mount totally sucks too.. I will never buy another TomTom product again&POS.
