i had no problems updating my map  .
i just removed some voices before doing the update  .
worked flawlessly  .
keep in mind with the map update it did take a lot of time  .
be patient  .
thanks to everyone complaining about the map being too big , when i hooked it up i did not install the update , instead i made a backup of my unit , then removed the old map from my unit first , then ran the latest map guarantee , now works perfectly , without any hiccups  .
i'm in love with this for a first true gps , and unlike the others , the updater works fine .
i would recommend this model to anyone in the market for a gps  .
it has all the necessities of any other gps , plus extras and a nice large display all for under $300 .
compared to other units i've been given this is a superior system .
good product , have to get use to te features and how to access them .
appears to be loaded with capabilities for a very reasonable price , buy it  .
while no gps is perfect  .
garmin showed old turn    off to new super target in richfild mn , tomtom had it correct  .
garm in had updated street signs by air force reserve tomtom didnt , so each gps unit will have plus and minus .
before i buy anything , i check it out on cnet  .
the editors reviews and then the user reviews  .
after reading some of these user reviews , i almost did not buy this product  .
i could not resist though , due to the sale price it is offered at  .
i am glad i did  .
i had no problem updating the map as some reviewers had  .
it took me about 1/2 hour to download the map with a broadband connection , and about one hour to add it to the unit  .
i will admit that i made a backup of the unit using the tom tom home software and removed the voices that were foreign to me first  .
the voices i removed from the unit were saved to my pc by the tom tom software , so i can always add them back in the future after the map update , i scrolled around the software and added a recorded human voice and a few poi's  .
i bought an s model that will state the road names you are to turn on to  .
this feature does not work if you choose to use a recorded human voice  .
it does work fine with one of the computer voices installed in the unit  .
to me this is not a problem , but thought some of you would like to know that prior to purchase i also read a few negative opinions about the mount  .
i actually like the mount  .
a quick quarter turn and it is adhered to the windshield firmly , i find it to pivot nicely also  .
if the thickness of the unit with the mount attached is a concern , i find it is easily removed from the back of the unit so i can leave the mount in the glovebox and take the unit with me in my jacket pocket  .
with the mount removed , it is no thicker than a tom tom one the tom tom home software is a nice way to update and customize the unit  .
i found it very easy to use  .
i is able to download a new startup picture for my unit for free through the software  .
there are also some optional accessories that you can access through the software for purchase i am not a poweruser  .
i'll use it on long trips and vacations  .
i have used it going to and from work , and realized the iq route technology is actually working  .
it told me to go to work using one route , and a different one to return home  .
i belive this is due to traffic at the time of day all in all , i feel i received a very good deal purchasing this unit  .
i hope that if you purchase this unit , your experience is as pleasing as mine was .
love it would ask santa for another 1 but dont wont to be gready  .
install the tomtom home software , but don't update  .
hook up the gps and go to managing the gps in the tomtom home software , then remove the voice languages you do not need  .
i removed french and spanish  .
i then backed up software on the tomtom home , then i updated and all is well  .
for the money , the features on this are fantastic  .
has lots of poi's and has been quite accurate in getting me around  .
the upper end garmin's are better , but your going to spend a lot more money  .
another feature i like is the mapshare  .
this is a feature that only tomtom has and i like it alot  .
i would recommend this gps , but delete voices first before any update , and you will be fine  .
nice , loud voice and good directions  .
i wish it would tell me which side of the road the house is on like my old garmin 350 , but the tomtom has so many upgraded features  .
very much worth the money .
this is my third gps  .
i also own a magellan and a garmin  .
while magellan's intelligent speller technology is superior (only valid letters are displayed at any time while entering city or street names , eliminating spelling errors) , tomtom's fresher maps trump that advantage , by including more newer streets  .
tomtom offers new maps every 90 days , whereas magellan offers upgraded maps every 18 months , and garmin every year  .
tomtom's mapshare technology is a dream  .
right out of the box , when i did my first free map update , it also downloaded mapshare information for my region that correctly routed me away from an overpass near my home that is closed for repair  .
there's one particular t    intersection in my city that is wrongly classified as a two    way turn on everybody's device (magellan , garmin and tomtom)  .
with the map correction software , i is able to teach the tomtom about the turn restrictions on this particular road , and is then able to upload those changes for anyone else with a tomtom  .
that community sharing feature is the deciding factor in my purchase of a tomtom  .
living in a smaller canadian city , the iq feature does not really do much for me , as there are probably not enough user experiences in the database to make a difference , although i have noticed that tomtom does not always choose the same route between points a and b , so that might be the iq software in action  .
i have found the poi list to be quite complete , and the ability to add my own custom categories to the poi database is perfect for keeping my clients' addresses handy and apart from any other clutter updated  .
on dec 10 , 2009  .
be careful if you install tomtom home and attempt to do updates  .
first , installed tomtom home without connection the 340s to your pc  .
then connect your gps  .
before downloading anything including any free map updates make a backup of everything on your gps via this tomtom home feature  .
next view everything on the device via home  .
most of us in the us wo not need anything other than the english voices  .
delete the other voices from the device only  .
this will free up some space on the device  .
remember that you've already backed everything up so you can get them back if you need them  .
now you can go get your free updated map , poi updates , quickfix updates , additional pois , etc  .
make an additional backup of the unit with all your completed updates  .
if this all sounds too complicated for you find your local tech geek or just use the unit out of the box without connecting it to your pc .
i bought this gps in june for $180  .
the device is great and very easy to use  .
i also loved the larger screen  .
i took it with me on several work trips around the country and relied on it heavily  .
then on a trip in july , i dropped it in a hotel lobby and cracked it  .
i is devasted  .
so , i had to buy a new for for $150  .
the device is worth every penny .
i just ordered my tom tom 340s last week and upon ordering it i started to see a lot of negative reviews which had me a little worried  .
much to my delight the 340s had zero problems connecting to tom tom home and also no issues with downloading and installing a updated map using tom tom's latest map guarantee  .
although , it did take about 58 minutes to download the map and over an hour and a half to install it into the unit  .
at one point i thought the unit had crashed as everyone says it does but i did not touch anything i just kept monitoring the device and finally the new map had uploaded  .
no memory issue , no freezing up , device works as it should .
overall , this is a nice gps for under $200 that i recommend unless you can afford the higher end models i read about the problems with the device only having about 1  .
9gb of memory , and the map upgrade crashing the system  .
i read on tomtom's support page that you need to delete about 35mb before attempting the map upgrade  .
using tomtom home 2 , if you delete the spanish french voices , you will gain about 175mb of space  .
i had no problem upgrading the map after deleting the unused voices i really like iq routes  .
my previous gps devices would always suggest the same routes , giving a deceiving arrival time because they had no idea about traffic lights and rush hour delays  .
the 340s routes me the quickest way using back roads just like the locals know  .
and the arrival time is much more realistic  .
it's great  .
iq routes can be slow to calculate  .
but i'm in the washington dc area  .
when i'm trying to get across 35 miles of maryland , dc , virginia traffic , iq routes finds upwards of 200 , 000 roads (taking about 12 seconds to calculate       not too bad unless you pass a intersection and it starts over again       this can last awhile)  .
usually traffic stops long enough for iq routes to catch up  .
if you do not know the area , you do need to pull over for a few seconds  .
but , when you are within 20 miles of your destination , iq routes is very fast i also like the travel via option  .
i often times need to stop at a store , bank , gas , food , etc along the way  .
with the travel via option poi along route , you can find what you need directly along your route it has a nice map navigation display , and has a reasonably fast boot    up , and very fast satellite capture  .
the display is a little dim in bright sunlight lastly , i cannot find a direct speed camera database to load into the poi  .
that would be nice .
this is a great stand alone unit ; great if you're lost or do not know where you're going  .
sometimes it takes you the long way around , but eventually it will get you there .
does what it should for a reasonable price despite what others report , i think tech support is quite good  .
i had trouble updating the map and the rep walked me through it  .
while online , i mentioned a problem with my xlone  .
the rep emailed me step    by    step instructions to fix that too  .
i've called them three times and have always received patient , polite , helpful and coherent instructions .
note   i do own    i got a great deal and bought two of these on black friday  .
sorry for the length , but i'm trying to help first off i'd like to note that the on of the big cnet cons is incorrect  .
i do not know if tomtom changed the easy port mount after the review , but mine pops right off and on (spring loaded mount around the speaker) ; there's only a small bulge on the back where the speaker is    very easy to transport in a pocket these devices are very quick , in both acquisition and re    routing  .
nice volume with various voice and display options (5 color schemes)  .
turns are noted well in advance and directions are very easy to understand one minor navigation issue that i've found so far is that (of all the addresses i've put in) it thinks my office is about 2/10s of a mile from where it really is  .
normally i would blame the map maker , but since tomtom acquired teleatlas i guess i blame tomtom but , i've had similar problems on my other devices with navteq maps before i get to the cons i'd like to say that my family also owns and uses 2 navigons , 2 magellans and a garmin and they all have quirks  .
this tomtom is a very nice unit quick and generally very accurate routing if that's what you're looking for you will probably like this unit a lot  .
but medium quirk   i live near newport news virginia , not a big town , but one with several zip codes  .
sometimes (not all the time) when i try to enter an address i'll start by entering the city first  .
then , when i try to enter the road , the unit cannot find it  .
but if i enter the zip code where the road is , it pops right up in auto complete  .
apparently the unit determines that each zip code in newport news is a separate city  .
so far i've known all the zip codes where i have been heading , but that's been kind of a pain in the butt major quirk   as noted in many of the previous write    ups , which i tried to follow religiously to no avail  .
following all of the posts i backed up both units and then tried to update  .
both had software and a free map update available  .
sometime in the software update process a file got corrupted    to make a long story somewhat shorter , that basically turned the first one into a brick no way to revert back to previous software , no way to delete the corrupt file  .
after 2 solid days of trying almost every fix i saw on the internet , including reformatting and then re    installing the backup i quit back to the store for an exchange (why  .
well as i noted it is a great deal) tried the update again with both the units i now owned , and i updated the software without a hitch , albeit incredibly slowly now i tried the map update   as previous posts have noted , it's too big for the internal memory so you have to delete the existing map and some voices (unlike some posts noted though , the new tomtom software actually guides you through this)  .
this too is incredibly slow (i mean oh my god slow)  .
after several hours the system froze  .
i tried again , twice same results  .
i turned off all anti    virus , and extraneous software and even my screen saver (i is grasping at straws) tried again no luck  .
reverted to old map and put both in the cars sans the new map just too darn painful to continue on a side note , i just updated my navigon map    that map too is too big for the 2gb sd card that came with the system , so i had to buy a 4gb card to install the new map    but after both experiences , i'd much rather deal with an external card , because you can always buy a new sd card cheap , but if the internal memory gets screwed up i think you're basically going to have to rma it ti tomtom that written , i still really like the units    but i think i'm going to keep them in my cars and away from my computer , lest i get the itch to update them again i hope this helps in your decision making .
i like it but it needs a few refinements  .
but an ok unit otherwise  .
i have no major buyer regrets but there has been a learning curve for me .
i found a ridiculously good deal on this tomtom on craigslist , but before buying it , i rang tomtom tech support (which is very quick to do and the young lady is actually in the states not oursourced somewhere) to see if the previous issue with the large maps had been resolved  .
turns out , according to tomtom tech anyway , that it is not the overly large maps that causes the trouble , but when people download additional computer voices , this is what causes the gps's brain to get too full  .
i am off to go purchase the thing this evening and will keep you posted .
called customer service , who referred me to tech support , he said it is an issue with the model sent it back today , fex    ex , postage paid , they will send me another unit  .
, , he said he will talk me though installing new map  .
that ought to be good , if it cannot fit to begin with lol  .
but very helpful to even try i'll see what happens .
love this product  .
i cannot say i would highly recommend this unit , as there are some issues going on with it  .
my first one is returned as having a defective motherboard , and my second one wo not charge with the car charger  .
use extreme caution when buying this unit .
ready to use the day you get it  .
i started using it in the parking lot at best buy and it worked perfectly pros   easily enter in an address , better visuals and user interface than other garmin devices i is looking at  .
cons   the battery life is a bit short , but i always have this plugged into the cradle in my car so really unless i want to carry it with me is this a problem .
i do like the tomtom products in general , however whilst driving back into new york on a sunday night the new technology in this latest gps ; the clever iq routes told us to take the lincoln tunnel and then took us through midtown past madison square garden at the time we didn't know new york at all and so proceed to endure the extra 1  .
5 hours that we did not need to now that we know the fdr takes us past all that traffic very easily  .
since then we have had to always plug in our destination and then specifically select an alternative route to go via a location to ensure it does not try to drive right through the middle of one of the world's most congested cities  .
given this technology is designed to avoid traffic congestion through the analysis of traffic data at different times of day , it really does not achieve what the marketing campaign claims other than this the unit works very well  .
would i recommend buying one yes but certainly not for the iq routes .
compared 330xls next to 340xls travelling in same car , on the same road , at the same time  .
330xls had exact road information when 340xls lacked street names , one    way access points and posted speed limits  .
340xls with iq routing option on made zig    zag turns increasing travel time  .
make sure to have a backup before using the map update feature  .
update crashed my unit three times  .
i do not require the maps for parts of mexico , i would have liked keeping all the map data features of the 330xls and having the mexico map as optional  .
summary    wait for a better revision or buy the 330xls instead .
have major heartburn with the pois   completely inaccurate  .
driving down the street , unit lists pois (ie , gas stations , restaurants) long gone  .
i do searches for well    established stores and gps does not know where they are  .
unless you're looking for a mcd's or hardees , you're out of luck  .
am headed back to best buy today to return this unit .
after less than 12 months of minimal use my unit failed  .
the support staff quickly determined that the device is beyond repair  .
they quickly pointed me to several outlets where i might purchase another  .
no thanks    this is the last tomtom product i will ever own .
stay away  .
it's ok , i probably should have shopped around a little longer before buying , would not purchase this model again  .
lack of memory slot and no outputs for other uses .
i took the prodcut out of the box , connected it to my computer to download the map update and i got a error message and the unit no longer worked  .
tried again , same result  .
called tom tom and got put on hold  .
looked at the troubleshooting on line and found 10 pages of gobblygook on renaming files , reinitializing , etc , etc  .
competeley unacceptable  .
apparently , this is a common problem judging from other posts  .
returned the unit to the store  .
boo on tom tom  .
do not bother with this one .
great paper weight choose a different manufacture if you want to save your self some stress  .
i would not reccomend tomtom  .
until tomtom gets its customer service right , you purchase a tomtom at your own risk  .
it appears that tomtom is not designed to update with mac computers  .
ok , we're only 11% of the computers but often the most tech savy  .
why they would write off this audience i don't know  .
i suppose if you consider your gps to be a disposable consumer item and rather than update maps would just give it away and buy a new one , then why do not they fix the problem  .
it's been 3 years since we last owned a tomtom and i would have thought they would have fixed the download problem updated  .
on aug 29 , 2010  .
from a local store , i got this device naively yesterday  .
it is on sale  .
this is the first gps we bought and my wife , my son and i were quite happy about it  .
it worked great until we drove back home  .
the only thing i noticed at that time is the touch screen is kind of slow and that i could type much faster than the machine response  .
but it is a small problem and i didn't care  .
then , while we took a lunch i connected to a pc to update the software , thinking that it would be over by the time we finished our lunch  .
while we took lunch we promised to go shopping using our new device  .
after lunch i realized that the update is still progressing with progress bar at about 2/3 of the full length  .
so i told my wife the update is not done yet and we waited for another hour  .
i kept net    surfing so that the machine does not go to sleep  .
well over an hour later , i still found the progress bar is at about 2/3  .
i cound not see anything in the tomtom home window which i could tell the update is going normally  .
i started think that the update is frozen somehow  .
then it came to my attention that there is a big red abort button which sounded like i could cancel the update  .
i hesitated a bit , but decided to click it and go shopping anyway as we planned  .
i thought i could do the update anyway in the evening if it takes a long time i quickly i realized that the device no longer contained the original map , making the device totally useless  .
i tried to update the software again , but this time i only got another error  .
so our plan changed to go back to the store to get another device  .
we could get a new one , and with that we went shopping as planned  .
returning home , i connected my replaced device to my pc prepared to do a long update then the software said something like 'the serial # of your device is different from the last one  .
are you sure you want to change to the new one  .
you can change your device only every 6 months  .
' i of course clicked yes  .
then the software gave me an error which i do not remember what it was  .
i restarted the software and connected the gps to pc again , then what the software had to say was , 'your device serial # is different from what is registered  .
you can change it only 6 months later'  .
what  .
what kind of software is this  .
i bought this gps today and i can do the update only 6 months later  .
no way  .
i called tomtom support  .
i got 'call us back on monday to friday'  .
this is sunday  .
by this time i had developed enough sense that this update software is a piece of junk and that i would be wasting this hours after hours trying to fix the problem  .
i chose the quickest solution   return the device after browsing through internet posts i have now learned enough that my decision to return the device is right  .
there is a usb cable in the box as if they recommend an update  .
tomtom should at least warn what kind of danger there exists in updating the software and how lot it is expected to take  .
the update software does not have a consumer grade quality i have now ordered a garmin updated  .
on aug 25 , 2010  .
state road names are not an acceptable for a map  .
look at any map    in any location except for very rural areas streets have names  .
how many people know what state road number they live on  .
the company said this is done on purpose  .
for the purpose of this unit in my husbands patrol car it is useless  .
i is amazed at the company's attitude about this  .
at $70 for the update i wanted the unit to be reset and a refund  .
they do not do refunds  .
they do not care about the quality of the product that they are selling  .
if this had been disclosed prior to the update i would not have wasted the money  .
i have a unit for sale cheap  .
the tomtom xl 340t is one of the worst pieces of technology i have ever purchased    and as a 30 year old man , i have bought my share of tech toys  .
i returned the tomtom after 10 days , bought a garmin at similar price and am now very happy with the garmin (more on that below)  .
problems with the tomtom xl 340t    .
1) most significantly , the touch screen sensitivity is inaccurate  .
it either is too sensitive (which resulted in double    taps) or not sensitive enough (i  .
, didn't do anything when i tapped the screen)  .
result    very difficult to navigate the menus 1a) also very important , the device gave bad directions  .
i used it on some familiar routes , and it came up with shall we say , unconventional directions , which took significantly longer  .
also , the device took a while to re    route when i deviated from the provided directions 2) the device requires you to navigate through many menus to do even very simple tasks (like go home or get directions to work )  .
it's nearly impossible to do a quick function (like find a nearby restaurant) while at a red light  .
the touch screen sensitivity issue (#1) compounds this issue 3) once the device has come up with directions to your destination , there is no button to return you to the main menu  .
you have to punch a spot on the map , which will then hit the corresponding item on the main menu  .
for example , if you tap the top left corner of the map , it might take you directly in to settings  .
again , this is compounded by the screen sensitivity issue  .
i frequently turned off the volume by accident when i is trying to return to the main screen 4) the electronic voices are almost impossible to understand , to the point that you really have to look at the device to figure out where you're going 5) as other reviewers have pointed out , you have to delete some of the data on the device in order to download the latest maps  .
seems silly , given that many competitors have a sd card slot 6) traffic was not very accurate  .
for example , one morning a 15 minute delay on the beltway didn't show up at all 7) the final time i used the tomtom , the traffic icon (which usually shows the traffic on your route on the right side of the screen) did not display    even though i had it set up to show traffic  .
i played with the menus for about 10 minutes , but could not get it to show up  .
this is the last straw after 10 days with the tomtom , i is wondering whether any portable gps could compare to my wife's in    car system  .
i do not believe that my tomtom unit is defective , merely horrible  .
fortunately , i returned the tomtom and got a garmin 255w with traffic  .
it is about $10 more , but is infinitely better  .
the traffic is not perfect , but the other problems noted above are not an issue with the garmin  .
i used the garmin on a 2 week trip to the opposite coast and am perfectly happy with it  .
the garmin is nearly as good as my wife's in    car system in conclusion , i would not recommend that anyone purchase the tomtom xl 340t  .
if you must buy , try it in a store first to make sure you can navigate the menus .
i purchased a refurbished one and regretted it quickly  .
when i tried to use my free 30 day map update it told me it is expired (the day after it is delivered to my home)  .
after clearing that up with tomtom , i found out that my gps is actually broken and unable to download the current map  .
the system memory kept coming up short  .
i spent around 4    6 hours divided between numerous occasions speaking to different tomtom customer service people trying to figure out the problem and eventually i even reformatted it  .
i even had an extremely rude tomtom customer service representative mouth off to me and actually hang up on me  .
this has been a terrible experience  .
good luck if you go this route  .
trust me , you do not want this low quality junk nor the rude service experience  .
my iphone will blow this piece of crap out of the water  .
if this is the best they have    i will do without .
i bought this gps because of his look , price and the fact that i is very satisfied with my old tomtom after 3 hours of relooping , i did an exchange for the same model the second worked better untill i go online to update the maps like this is asked  .
this is a free map after 5 hours of downloading , i realize that this gps went from all usa to only western region the gps is after asking for a code that does not exist  .
i try to call tomtom during more than 2 hours but no one ever answer i send an e    mail asking for the code but even if they are promising an answer in the next 24 hours , i never had any reply so i decide that i will reset the unit to put back the usa map backed    up on my computer to finally realize that there is nothing saved this product is a junk , stay away from tomtom  .
i had a garmin that worked ok for a few years  .
bought a tomtom to hear hommer  .
should have bought another garmin .
everything has pretty much been said here , they did send me a new one after much fuss , the new one never worked , now they want me to sit here night after night trying to fix this one do not think so  .
i watched a presentation of this unit done by a representitve of tomtom  .
i is very impressed with the units capability's that were demonstrated  .
once i got the unit  .
i downloaded the tomtom home program  .
, and it all went downhill from there  .
once you hook up the unit it searches for new maps with it's 30 day map guarantee  .
the program found that a new map is available for download for free  .
i spent hours trying to download the new map only to start receiving error messages  .
at this point the unit no longer worked at all  .
i called tomtom customer service  .
and they sent me some links that would help me flash the unit and reinstall software  .
more time is wasted , more errors messages , and then software said that the new map is too big to fit on the unit  .
i called tomtom back again and gave them the rundown of what had occurred and they looked up my problem #  .
they then said oh you have the 340 s ; there is a glitch in those units  .
she then explained that the automatic update that occurs when you first hook it up , is what cripples the unit  .
i asked if i could flash the unit and download the original software image and reinstall  .
she said no  .
when asked why tomtom would release a product with such a major issue  .
she said i do not know i just work in the call center  .
needless to say i am just returning this unit as defective and not going through the rma process i have been a beta tester for various hardware and software company's and i have never seen a product , even in a beta test ; released with such a major software issue bottom line  .
if you must have this unit , or received it as a gift ; do not under any circumstances update the unit or you will have a $250  .
00 paperweight .
Good screen, nice company website; Updating maps took away street names. It left us with state road numbers.
nice screen size..text to speech..tom-tom home .; Same problem as all else.. bought new map..too big. Accidentally deleted old map off computer.
Very Quick GPS Acquisition. Very Quick Rerouting. Auto Day/Night Screen Change. One or two click menu. Good Auto-Complete; An updating nightmare. All memory is internal -no external memory card options.. You better know the Zip Code
Pretty accurate. fast re-routing easy to update. very good unit; every gps has some problems. Mine some old street names by airforce reserve base
Well, it's svelte. And has a nice mount.; Touch screen is dodgy. Inaccurate directions. Overly complex menus. Unclear voice. No SD slot. Traffic reports not accurate
List of POI's available online to download.; Outdated maps.. Very poor reliability.. Bad customer service.. Updates not workings.. Not working at all.
Nice advertisement!; Arrived unable to accept latest map upgrade. Item had to be returned to get it exchanged. TomTom customer service agent's can be unhelpful and rude (bad experience).
Mapshare is great! Free update is even better!; No 3D buildings like the newer models. Interface could use a makeover :P
Super fast speed for redirecting, all the new bells and whistles makes this 1000 times better than my ONE 3rd edition; A little bulky
loved all the extras that my garmin did not have, mapshare, lane guidence, ect; terrible support, and even worse unit
Easy to use, inexpensive, IQ routes and street voice recognition.; Window mount and delay in satelite signal upon turning on device.
Well priced, easy to use, aside from IQ Routes it's an improvement.; IQ Routes should help when you don't know the roads....... they don't in our experience.
nice paperweight. screen colors are easy to read.; (1) unit application menu has none working features. (2) tech support has canned answers with no hands-on knowledge (3) tech support unable to solve problem after five different calls (4) no menu option to backup user entered mapshare data
Found a great price on craigslist; Bit wary of the negative reviews posted here... will give it a go anyway
Price point; Performance. No Tech Support available from TomTom. Their solution to an issue, after you jump through hoops explaining the problem, is to give you an RMA which takes between 10-15 days for turn-around.
Customer service number was answered with relatively little hold time.; Faulty product released with know major "glitches". Uniformed phone personal. Tom Tom home program irreversively renders the unit useless. No online fix for known software issues. No warning of known issues in the box, documentation, or online.
features, size and sound; Does not say which side of the street your destenation is on
None. It does not work right out fo the box; Well, it didn't work out of the box. How's that for a big CON?
so far i love it pluged it up deleated some voices and put sling blade on mine update worked great; none yet wished it came with a case to put it in.
Easy to use and lots of features; First unit died in 1 week, the replacement from TOMTOM took over 2 weeks to arrive and died within one hour.
Simple and legible screen/interface, The window mount holds very tightly.; The quick connect is a little weak. I knock it off the window mount regularly. I think I'd prefer a straight-in USB cord over the right-angle plug.
Nothing yet.; 4 hours and 27 minutes of downloads and tech support and still it is a no go. Reminds of the toys I got as a child - "Some assembly required" and never worked.
Excellent GPS. Easy to use and accurate. Nice HELP ME features built-in.; Install TomTom Home. Connect device. Do backup of device as is out of the box. Delete any unnecessary voices (frees up space). Do updates. Do another backup .. don't overwrite the first backup. Happy GPSing.
This is the same model as the xl340s, except without the Mexico maps. I got this for $99.99 at Costco, in fact I bouth two of them. For the money, there is not a better deal out there.; BE SURE AND DELETE THE VOICE LANGUAGES YOU DON'T NEED BEFORE UPDATING, OTHERWISE YOU WILL END UP WITH A BRICK.
Nothing!. Has not worked from day 1..Customer Support has been more interested in trying to prove that there is a problem on my end then admitting the defective product!; Has not worked , Poor Customer Support!
Fairly accurate but slow to respond e.g. when leaving an airport parking lot. Really got confused here with frequent changes in direction. Had to beg exit attendents to get out of the airport parking lot!; Poor readability of data from driver position. Slow response where turns are frequent (see above). Awkward attachment to windshield. Also very difficult to see screen in glaring or bright light. Short free update time is unreasonable.
Very user friendly and easy to navigate with. The speaker is functional without being too distorted. Easy to see while attached to windshield.; The power charger has stopped functioning. GPS unit has fallen off the windshield mount a couple times already.
Nice Screen and easy to use menu system; not to accurate on some of the nav points when entered by GPS coordinates instead of a street address
Cheep, relatively slim when you have the car mount popped off, very loud audible speaker. The updater worked fine,; Initial map update took 4-6 hours to download and write, understandable it was 1.4GB. When writing info to the unit, it seems to use a burst mode and go idle for a bit.
This is much better than nothing, but my friend seems to have a better experience with her cell phone naviagator.; Not as convenient as having a cell phone on you that has GPS navigation. Also - sometimes sends you on crazy trips that take you out of the way you want to go.
I like the big display - it provides at a glance clarity without using the voice prompt. It gets me to my destination with a minimum of fuss.; It's a little slow keeping up with sharp turns - off ramps, cloverleaves and the like
The price was very good and I bought it at Circuit City. The actual routes were not very good - keep putting me on small roads even if you set the option correctly. Battery was weak as crap.; After only 4 months of use - the unit quit working. I was very gentle with it.
Pros: easily enter in an address, better visuals and user interface than other garmin devices I was looking at; Cons: the battery life is a bit short, but I always have this plugged into the cradle in my car so really unless i want to carry it with me is this a problem.
Easy to use with a little practice.. IQ routes and MapShare are invaluable.. Choosing POI's on your route is very helpful. Maps seem to be fresher than competition; Did not sync to satellites as quickly as I thought it would.
Big screen. Already charged so works out of the box. Various voices built in even if you can't download new ones. Cheap (but not for value received); Second TomTom we've owned, my wife bought it for herself. I had one previously, purchased voices, they couldn't be downloaded when upgrading unit. New unit, trying to download new map. Won't work with a Mac computer. Out $50. Will cancel with Amex.
I like the higher end options that this low priced GPS has, such as:. - IQ Routes, which allows you navigate like a local.. - Lane assistance. - Easy to find &#38; add additional destinations along your route (which can save a lot of time); - IQ Routes does take a few seconds to calculate the fastest route. If, while it is calculating, you go through just 1 intersection, IQ Routes will then recalculate the route again. This can go on for several miles.
This model is a good gps for the average user. It has all the functions one needs to get moving confidently in the right direction. It has a large screen size which makes it easy to see and has many good extras that make it even better.; It is a little bulky due to the mounting device on the back which makes it hard to put in a pocket, but otherwise no real problems.
Ease of use; large screen; easy to use mount; easy to backup and update; customizable; Tom Tom Home software is also easy to use and is a nice way to manage the info on this unit; One road I travel is not on the map, I guess I'l lhave to use Map Share for user fixes; I did expect it to be there with the updated map.
