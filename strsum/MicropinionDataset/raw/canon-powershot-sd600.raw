Pros:. I've taken more than 35,000 pictures on it during my 4 years with it. It's been dropped (hard!) five or six times, and keeps on tickin'! The "manual" mode allows experimentation and good quality photos in a variety of conditions.. 
Cons:. None, really -- I wish it was waterproof!. 
Summary:. If you can get a reasonably priced used one, go for it -- it's definitely worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very user-friendly, and sharp, detailed pics. For the price-top notch!. 
Cons:. Absolutely nothing.. 
Summary:. This has been the best camera I've ever purchased. I had the misfortune of losing my first one (Careless me.), and I immediately sought a replacement. I love it, and would definitely get another-hope I don't have to though.:). 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, great photos, compact size.. 
Cons:. We've had it for a year and not found any yet.. 
Summary:. Very good choice, we have taken hundreds of pictures, maybe thousands and absoluteley love everything about it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Image Quality and Compact. 
Cons:. limitations of an ultra-compact camera. 
Summary:. This camera did not disappoint, with the ISO settings, and also the Stitch function, which allowed me to get a great panorama view of the Manhattan skyline,and you short in low light. The camera feels sturdy, and the LCD screen seems to have a coating that makes it hard to scratch. Ergonomics are great, and I never had it fall out of my hand while grabbing for it in my pocket.. The only thing I didn't expect is a high-pitched mechanical whirring noise when you power on the camera, and when you focus. This noise is in addition to the mechanical zoom in/out sound. The previous models did not have it, and I almost returned the camera because of this. I had to go down to Fry's to hear the floor model do the same thing, and also the SD630. I guess the new models all have this sound. Just a heads-up.. 

$$;
Pros:. VERY fast, easy to use.. 
Cons:. Absolutely none. 
Summary:. I rate this camera a "10" based on what it was designed to do, not on the entire universe of possible options. Simply put, if you want a FAST, high-quality, small camera you just cannot do any better.. This is my 4th digital point n' shoot camera and for what we wanted it's perfect. My old camera missed a lot of shots of my young kids because it took so long to power, focus and shoot. What this camera excells at is SPEED. Hit the power button and WHAM - it's on and focused, ready to shoot.. It's small enough to put into your pocket and the image quality is superb. The featureset is moderate but very useful - for instance you can manually set the ISO from 100 to 400 depending on the speed you want. There are various preset modes you can easily adjust to - nighttime, outdoors, indoors, even underwater if you have the diving case.. I can think of very few products I've bought in my life that were perfect, but this is one of them. It meets and exceeds my every expectation. Any smaller and it would be too hard to handle. Any more options and it would be too cumbersome to navigate. They got this camera just right.. I went on Ebay and got an extra battery and small case. I keep the extra charged battery in the case and never miss a shot. A 2gb SD card is under $20 these days and holds ~700 maximum quality photos. Unbelieveable!. Now, if you're expecting to take magazine quality low-light action photos this is not the camera for you. Go get a $1500 Digital SLR. If you want a compact, handy, speedy point n' shoot this is the one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy portability, price,. 
Cons:. Nothing nothing. 
Summary:. This a exelent camera for your photography............... Is A exelent buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's almost 3 times smaller than my last digital camera, with the same LCD screen size. The quality of the pictures are also so much better! This is perfectly portable, fast startup and image process!. 
Cons:. No battery meter, but I'm actually fine with that and won't knock off an entire point since the battery lasts long enough for me anyway, my previous camera dies so fast with fresh AA batteries.... 
Summary:. I'm a canon man now, I converted from sony and nikon cameras. Just something about the image processing and the post editing on photoshop that makes this so much easier. I am very happy with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. The pictures come out really clear and they look great!!. 
Cons:. It is hard to zoom in super duper close- like to some moss.. 
Summary:. Don't get any other brand of camera. THis one is really great. Seriously, I have seen all the pictures that my other firends and family have taken with their lame cameras- and it is nothing like the pictures I can taek with my Canaon.. Anna23@natureday.com. 

$$;
Pros:. Autoupright, Small, great pics, video. Color effects.ISO 800. 
Cons:. usb port is difficult to acess, only plastic moving part of otherwise all metal body.. 
Summary:. Great for my purposes. I have it for one month now, and have taken more than 1000 pictures (new 2Gb sd card!) already.. Pros:. 1. Small. Works great due to small form factor with newer sd cards.. 2. I like the auto-upright function for pictures. Basically if you tilt the camera 90 degrees the picture automatically turns upright when you pull into the computer. This feature is unique to canon I think and works great with picassa.google.com to make web albums. That one feature has helped me save atleast an hour of not having to rotate pictures in a photo editor while creating a 100 pic web album from about 800 holiday pics. I was very trigger happy, and was pleasantly surprised it took less time to make and album and email it to relatives.. 3. Auto color sensing feature. You can set one color to "pop out" of an otherwise black and white photo. Makes people think you are very photoshop savvy when you only spend one extra minute to do it in the camera. There is no loss of fidelity also as you dont have to reprocess a jpeg.. 4. ISO 800. This mode is very useful for low light. Somewhat grany pictures but great light. I guess in bright light it gives even brighter pics so I ended up leaving it always in the 800 mode. Nice new feature, not there in older canons.. 5. Great video. Nice sized, video, can project with reasonable quality on my home theater projection system. (I am saving tons of time not having to deal with the computer and studio programs). Cons:. 1. USB Port Cover. It is a metal piece, but it is attached with a plastic thingy, which you have to pull out before you can open it. I am being very careful with it as I am very worried this will break with successive use.. No other cribs yet.. Summary:. Go buy it. I am hard to please and this one did it for me. I returned 3 other cameras this BF season before settling on this one. I highly recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to take pictures..kind of fun to use. 
Cons:. None that I can find. 
Summary:. I have or presently own many digital cameras from the onset of the digital era and have been taking pictures for over 50 years I also have professional training. I find this camera to be of the highest quality. I view this genre of cameras to be a point and shoot variety and it has met or surpassed my expectations. It is the only one with a seperate viewfinder (essential for outdoor shooting). The manual was simple to understand and follow. The onscreen menu is easy and most important the picture quality is superior. Even my wife who does not like to take pictures would have fun with this. A solid 10!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, great pictures, fast shots, DVD quality movies, very small!!!!. 
Cons:. None so far.. 
Summary:. I got this camera for my 68 y/o father. He hates carrying a camera and video cam. I got him this for the video quality. It had to be the most simple thing for him to use. And It Is!!! 6MP/DVD Movies/ Fits easily in pocket. $200. I cant think of anything better. Im buying another for my wife.. Kefta. 

$$;
Pros:. Very portable, BeAuTiFUL PiCtURes!!!! Plenty of features. 
Cons:. How could anyone dislike ANYTHING about this camera????. 
Summary:. I got it mainly to take pics of my daughter and because I got a great deal on Dell. She's two and moves ALOT. I have not taken a blurry photo yet even though it has no image stabilization, which is something that almost convinced me not to purchase it. But, I gave it a try and it's simply wonderful. I held it to a cigarette box and it is exactly the same size. You cannot see the camera around them no matter how you hold the box...so it really is a pocket camera. And they say it only has basic function? This is honestly the first camera I've owned, but I'm very good with electronics...I've had it 3 hours and still have not figured out all the functions, but there are tons of functions to play with. A must have!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. image QUALITY!. 
Cons:. Nothing so far. 
Summary:. Had a Nikon N90s and switched to the digital technology trynig to get something less bulky and easier to deal with. This tiny camera is superb! My greatest concern is always image quality and this little one is HD! Very simple, very intuitive. Thanks Canon!.

Pros:. honored euro warranty in the US.. 
Cons:. lens jammed.. 
Summary:. ok, bought this camera in the UK while i was living there for about 2 months (its called the ixus 60 there). served me very well. basically fell in love with the quality of the photos and the function and features of the camera. took it everywhere with me.. i get home, and its fine, and i fly to NY. worked fine on the plane, but i'm about to take my first picture there, the lens jams. well, that sucked because i wasn't able to take any pictures while i was out there.. so i gotta get this thing fixed, so i call canon, they ask me a few questions, try to troubleshoot it - no go. so they have me send it in, but are kinda uncertain if they'll honor the euro warranty in the usa. so i sent it in anyway (they made it really easy - just download, print and fill out a form and put it in the box with the camera). i check my status of the camera online and it said it was warranty work. i was stoked. got the camera back, brand new lens (old one had a dent in it from being dropped a few days after i got it), nicely packaged 2-day fedex.. camera is back. only took about 10 or 11 days from when i shipped it out for it to get back to me. the only thing i paid for was shipping it there, cost me like $4.30 or something from san jose, CA to IL.. anyways, besides that. there are too many rad features to list, and i've already written a lot so i'll let the rest of the reviews do this camera justice.. i give this camera and canon as a company a 10. they deserve it. i feel like any other company just wouldn't do this. if the warranty hadn't been honored, the repair would have cost me nearly $140. thats like nearly 1/2 the value of the camera.. sorry, i'm ranting again.. A+.. 

$$;
Pros:. fantastic pictures. 
Cons:. no internal memory. 
Summary:. I read some people nit pic over features, but what I was looking for a great point and shoot camara with good PQ and this camara fits the bill.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ultra small, great photos, very fast, practically all features you would really need.. 
Cons:. No battery meter, but still there is a low battery warning.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, great picture and video quality. 
Cons:. Buttons slightly clumsy. 
Summary:. Thumbs up for this little master!! Can fit in my shirt pocket and shoots amazing photos and videos!! Highly recommended.... 

$$;
Pros:. Great Pic Quality, Awesoem peformance!. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. This is a great small camera. Awesome picture quality. It powers on very fast and its ready to shoot the first picture. All of this will happen in about 3 seconds. Has awesome shooting modes and manual mode as well. I like to play a little bit as well. It fits and goes everywhere.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture Quality, Video Quality, Size, Screen.. 
Cons:. USB hatch feels cheap, Zoom quality is limited.. 
Summary:. I bought this camera over a year ago and have shot about two thousand stills and several videos with it. For some reason it was only $279 back then and now street price is about $600. Check out dpreview for best camera ratings. I went to Yosemite with a friend who owns a $2000 Canon DSLR. My pictures came out better! Sharper and more accurate in color. I can't explain it really,especially when you compare his fat lens to my tiny one. Also was very impressed with shots at night of Christmas decorated houses. The colored lights were sharp and color defined with no burning or red shifting, and the camera handled the extreme contrasts of the lights and dark surroundings beautifully. Video quality is also excellent except when zoomed in where pixilation becomes obvious. The metal body is very attractive and this camera does not feel cheap like many compacts do. Again, low light performance was excellent, and the screen is quite fine. You can use the optical viewfinder when sun glare is a problem, but practice your framing because the viewfinder is way off. Color saturation is outstanding, and I rarely felt the need to use Photoshop.. I took a hundred or so shots of the San Francisco Carnaval on a semi overcast day. Without the harsh shadows of a bright sun, the colorful costumes popped off the images and these were the most satisfying photographs I have ever taken! I'm not a pro, but I used to use AE1 programs and used to print and develop my own photos eons ago...I took a full year of photography in College so I consider myself an advanced amateur. If you don't need to zoom a lot, this camera will do everything you want it to. That's pretty amazing for a camera that will fit in your pocket.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good shutter speed, quality pictures, easy to use, auto focus, battery life, &#38; size. 
Cons:. It does not have a delete all option for deleteing pictures.. 
Summary:. I've had this camera for at least 6 to 8 months now and I absoluty love it. I paid around $200 for it and for the price I paid vrs the quality of camera you just can't beat it. I don't have any other camera to compare it to but I realy like this one. I turn it on zoom if needed press the button half way wait for the green box and take the picture.. Now some of the pictures don't come out as nice as I would like but I just take another one (great thing about digitals with LCD) and most people that use film only expect one good picture out of a roll of film, so I get around 90% of my pictures to come out great. Also with a 1G memory card I can take just over 700 pictures.. The size is great it fits right in my pokets and its easy to cary and hold if you expect to take pictures. The options for taking pictures are easy to use and redily availible for quick acsess. There are plenty of options like red eye reduction, ISO, Macro and a few others to boot. The only thing I didn't like about the camera is that there was no option to delete all pictures (wich all in all might not be a bad thing) but you just have to remeber to do it right after you download them to the CP and go into the camera CTR + A and then delete. I'm no profesinal but for me an avrige user for family and stuff it's great and the size make it perfict for travel.. The battery life is great I havn't had the battery die on me in the middle of shooting and if conserved right can last a few days without recharging. also the charger is smaller thatn the camera and is easy to take traveling.. 

$$;
Pros:. so easy to use, fun features. 
Cons:. there really is nothing to complain about. 
Summary:. I bought my camera off of beachcamera.com for a little over $200. It's strikingly simple, well designed, and compact. Most people have already raved about the great features so I'll just mention three things.. It has a gravity sensor. I don't know if most cameras have this but just like the iphone, when you hold the camera vertically while viewing photos, it automatically shifts the picture for you so you can see it better. At first I had no idea why it moved by itself and then after I realized it, I felt all silly and giddy.. Another feature I'm not too familiar with is the ability to change pictures into black and white and sepia. Nice touch. Again, I don't know if most other cameras have this, but it's really fun to use.. Great mechanism for charging. I love how there are no cords in order to charge this. You're given a small adapter, you pop the removable battery into it, you plug it into the wall and when the light turns yellow it is fully charged. So easy and portable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small with great battery life. 
Cons:. No battery meter but I haven't found that a problem.. 
Summary:. I have no compatibility problems with XP. I consider my photography skills very basic. I like the fact take 200+ pictures over the course of a couple weeks without a recharge. Its small enough that I always have it in my pocket.. The video works great, better than my old Kodak Easyshare.. I chose it over the 630 because I wanted the viewfinder. My Kodak was always low on battery power and I was concerned that with only the larger screen I would have problems. The battery life on the SD 600 is so good, I never worry about it. The screen is big and clear enough that my wife can see the pictures fine without her glasses.. Every Sunday I charge the battery overnight and I have enough to take 200-300 photos the following week. Sometimes I forget and I still haven't had a problem. I use it for work verification photos and pictures of my kids.. I looked at a lot of digital cameras before purchasing this one. There are some good deals in the sub $200 range but you have to look for them. I paid $175 at Staples in March 07.. To sum it all up, unless this camera breaks, I don't see myself buying a new camera for a long, long time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, takes great pictures. Fast response. 
Cons:. Nothing bad for me. 
Summary:. I recently updated from Canon Powershot SD200 to the SD600 and the difference is phenomenal. I cannot imagine a better camera for everyday use. Closeups are super crisp. The 3x optical zoom is great. The 12x digital zoom is nearly perfect. Movies on this camera are clear and I was able to zoom while taking the movie.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features, great size, excellent video quality.. 
Cons:. I have not found any.. 
Summary:. This camera is great. It takes superb pictures. My favorite thing about the camera is that it takes high quality video images. The zoom is great and the size is very comfortable. Canon by far makes the best cameras. I had an olympus once and will never use them again. By far this is the best Canon I have ever owned.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact design, takes great pictures. 
Cons:. Pictures can be a bit grainy if camera not set right. 

$$;
Pros:. Great size and features.. 
Cons:. I can't think of any.. 
Summary:. Awesome picture quality! Totally amazing! Videos are cool with this too. But, what gets everyone's eye is when you're reviewing the pictures, if you took a portrait picture you can just tilt the camera and the picture turns sideways so you can see it better. So many people have thought this was just amazing. Overall, I love this camera!. 

$$;
Pros:. Affordable, small, 6 megapixels, 3x optical zoom, lithium ion battery. 
Cons:. Need to purchase new battery if you loose battery or run out of juice. 
Summary:. As as freshman in college, I needed a camera to help me remember all the great times I had. I got my camera for Christmas.. Once I opened the package, I was surprised how small the camera actually was and how big the screen was. The second thing I noticed was the nice metal finish. I turned it on and started to test out the camera.. Pros:. - Turns on fast; don't have to wait long to start taking pictures. - 3x optical zoom along with digital zoom. - Sturdy, durable, as far as I can tell, scratch proof. - Easy navigation. - Large screen. - Small size camera. - Battery lasts long compared to 2 AA or AAA batteries.. - Takes decent quality video. Cons. - No extra battery if your first one runs out of juice or you lost your other battery. - No case. - Comes with only 16mb SD card. It has been a couple months with the camera, and I haven't had a problem since I've got it.. 

$$;
Pros:. small, light, quick, great usablilty and good quality pictures. 
Cons:. none, so far as I'm concerned. 
Summary:. I did loads of research before buying this model. We needed something very small, no fuss, with reliable picture quality. We have used an older model of Canon digital camera for the past 3 years, and have been fairly happy, but we needed an upgrade. We have been so satisfied with our purchase. It is affordable, high quality, and came in a very small package. We considered getting the very highly rated SD800, but, frankly, I'm glad we didn't.. I'm no expert on cameras, but that's exactly why this camera is so perfect. You can easily switch from one mode to another, or quickly turn the flash off. In general, that's all I ever want to do. I didn't give it a "10" for the simple reason that the are a few features it lacks (such as image stabilization), but I don't feel like I'm missing anything. If you're looking for something with more bells and whistles, I would go with the SD800. But if you want a camera that does the point-and-shoot thing like a predictable charm, this is it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid Build, great movie capture, reasonable manual features, User friendly navigation. 
Cons:. Red eye reductions is not as good as other cameras of same class. Low light shoots need improvments.. 
Summary:. Despite small little glitches, it's a great camera to have in this price. I have used Sony and I must admit that Sony is little more user friendly than Canon but there is a fair difference in image quality.. Canon SD600 takes great photos and somehow capture amazing video clips too. One of the good features is dedicated button to transfer images to PC.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture quality. 
Cons:. No Image Stabilization. 
Summary:. I recently bought the Olympus FE-230 (after having an older Canon) and quickly returned it for this camera. The Olympus did have image stabilization, however, the picture quality was so crappy it didn't matter if my subject (my toddler) was still or not. I would have given the Canon SD600 a 10 out of 10 if it had the image stabilization feature. The camera takes amazing photos without it, but it would be nice to have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Takes great pictures! Inexpensive Canon quality camera. Very fast performance. 
Cons:. No image stablization (you spend more to get that feature). 
Summary:. I bought this Canon camera last Thanksgiving (2006) to replace another great Canon 2 megapixal digital camera that I loved but that had over the years become a dated dinosaur.. If you're like me and used to an older slower performing digital cameras, you'll be amazed at the fast start up, sheer speed and performance when taking pictures. I'm a happy camper!. This really is a great ultra compact point and shoot camera that you can fit into a pocket and take with you anywhere. Feels sturdy.. Canon is smart to continue making ultra compact cameras that include a small but usable optical viewfinder along with a nice sized 2.5-inch screen.. The 6 megapixals on this camera is more than plenty for the average point and shoot person.. Buy this ultra compact camera with great Canon quality built in while it's still available. At the great current prices, I'd be really surprised if it stays around much longer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quality steel desgin, 2.5" screen, many settlings, 15 second long exposure capable, super long battery life even when the screen is used. 
Cons:. Probably not for those with abnormally big hands, and probably not for those who don't know how to read the advanced manual.. 
Summary:. Some people have said you cannot select how long you want the shutter to stay open for long exposures and this is a lie. Please for the love of technology read the advanced manual or at least wait to review things till after you know what you're talking about. You can keep the shutter open up to 15 seconds in manual mode, you just need to enable long shutter times (Switch to Manual mode &gt; Menu &gt; ISO &gt; ISO &gt; Long Shutter to ON) see... Easy as apple pie. Now to use the long shutter (Func &gt; Down to Exp. &gt; Menu &gt; Left/Right to select shutter time) wow! Now as for having to have a super steady hand, no not really. I shake pretty bad and so far I haven't had a blurry image, it's all in the settings my friends. Just take your time and read up on this camera in the 2 manuals that come with it. If this is too hard go get a Kodak or something........ 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent pix n videos; Easy 2 use; Logical Manual controls; Easy 2 carry. 
Cons:. little low battery life. 
Summary:. Excellent Pix &#38; Videos, Versatility n Programmability of manual controls are just some of the sexy features of this little babe iXus60. Pix r clear enough 2 capture even dust particles or ORBS, when shooting in night/dark. (dust particles while snapping photos in dusty areas or ORBS while snapping in ghostly or haunted areas, ha ha. Those who r crying over poor night photos,try this setting 2 get the true night pic better than its competitors like Sony, Casio, Olympus, etc.. Shooting Mode = Manual. Exposure Compensation = +2. Skin Tone = Dark. Metering method = Evaluative. Compression = Superfine (for most settings). Flash = Off (if object is illuminated). Flash = Auto if there is poor light.. Those who r crying over problems faced after connecting the cam with Win XP, better install licenced version of windows XP. Windows XP has clear n most simple way of communicating with wide range of cams, printers &#38; scanners.. U dont even need to install Canon Photo Software.. Those who r crying over lack of anti-shake feature, better use timer to snap the photos. Set the timer to say 2 seconds and press the button, buzzer will beep and there u go. the software inside camera does the job of snapping the photo which r crisp clear and offcourse with 0% blurrrrrr.. BEST anti-shake by default is present in Casion Exilim series. but Casio is no match 2 Canon when it comes 2 indoor/close-up/night photos. Remember anti-shake doesnt work well in night modes/while shooting in dark.. Metering methods are simply mindbogling.. Using that u can snap clear pix under bright lights. even when the cam is facing the light source.. Slight Con is when the low battery warning appears then u have roughly 10 min 2 finish up the photo session. so b quick or carry a spare battery with u.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clean and crisp pics, very easy to use.. 
Cons:. None that I've found. 
Summary:. I love this camera! Just bought it about a month ago and have had several occasions to use it. It takes great pics, some better while on manual, so you can make use of all the great settings, such as: inside, pets, nighttime, fireworks, snow. The pics are very clean and crisp, and the movie option is pretty cool - you can take short movie clips and e-mail them!. You'll definitely need an additional memory card and an extra battery (both easily and cheaply purchased on eBay). I also got a card reader, so no need for cords and loading the software onto every computer.. I bought the camera (brand new) and all the accessories (carrying case, memory card, cleaning case, small tripod, card reader) on e-Bay for $239. Great buy!. I've read several reviews where people mention being concerned about scratching the screen. I found some screen protectors on eBay and they work perfectly; and they don't distort the LCD screen at all. Just search: canon sd600 protector OR guard. They were $1 + S&#38;H and well worth the price. No further need to be super careful about simple scratching, dust and finger marks.. Overall, a great camera!!!. Highly recommended!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice LCD display and nice quality photos. 
Cons:. I can't think of any so far. 
Summary:. I am so happy with this camera. I had originally purchased a Sony DSC S500 and was so disappointed with it. I returned it and replaced it with this Canon Digital Elph and am glad I did. The photo quality is fantastic in all lighting situations. I love the software that comes with it too. This is a versitile camera that is so reliable and easy to use. Plus the compact design makes it great to store in your purse or pocket. I know so many people who have this Canon Digital elph and I have not heard one bad thing about it. Do yourself a favor, and get this camera. You will not be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Build and picture quality.. 
Cons:. limitations of an ultra-compact camera. 
Summary:. I've owned several Kodak digital cameras over the past 5 years ranging the full rainbow of quality. I purchased this Canon when my last DX Kodak had battery issues, and breaking plastic parts due to poor design and cheap materials. I'm never going back. The Canon SD600 has excellent build quality and materials, a decent battery charge, incredibly compact yet feels rugged (an honest pocket camera), but the image quailty is way above anything I've seen from Kodak. The color rendering, crispness, and automatic exposure and ISO is all excellent - you have to work to take a bad picture with this one. I'm very pleased with this camera after a frustrating experience of my Kodak DX only lasting two years. Menu is 'bare' if you are national geographic photographer, for the 99% rest of us mortals, you will find it well thought out and easy to navigate after the first day.. 

$$;
Pros:. stunning image, great features, fast performance. 
Cons:. just a quite noisy zoom...but still is a perfect camera. 
Summary:. I like this camera for its really fast performance, stunning image and graphics, and has good features...I would recommend this for people who takes pride in photohraphy,graphics,performance,and technology. 

$$;
Pros:. small, easy to use, awesome pictures. 
Cons:. had to buy a larger capacity smart card, blurry zoom.

Pros:. Size and image quality.. 
Cons:. Too many features.. 
Summary:. I've had many 'name' film camers and this is my fourth digital. A Fujifilm MX-2900 ($450), Fujifilm 1300 ($150), one Kodak C743 ($150) that I didn't keep long. The SD600 ($212) is better than the rest all put together. It is really a quality camera in an unbelieveably small package.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick start-up, compact, very simple to use, photo quality very good. 
Cons:. Red-eye reduction isn't all that great. 
Summary:. Canon really seems to have figured out this whole "digital camera" concept, finally. Too bad other companies haven't caught up - I previously had the equivalent Olympus 6-megapixel point-and-shoot (Stylus 600), and it simply didn't measure up in a number of ways - most importantly, ease of use and photo quality.. Whereas my wife had trouble figuring out the Olympus at times, the Canon is mind-numbingly simple - as it should be. It really is point-and-shoot.. The photo quality is great, especially when compared with the Olympus. When all is said and done, poor quality was the one reason we simply couldn't use the Olympus any more - we had to delete 75% of the shots we took because they came out horribly. Night and day with the Canon - the vast majority of our shots are keepers now.. The videos it takes are really impressive in their quality. It uses some sort of image stabilization, so the video isn't bouncing all over the place; you get surprisingly good results, as if the video was taken with a real video camera.. One recent discovery for me: The macro mode is amazing. It takes simply awesome close-up shots; you'll have to try it out and see.. The one nit I have to pick: Its red-eye reduction isn't very effective. In some situations, it just doesn't work. But really, any time the flash and lens are so close together, you're going to get that, and 5 minutes in Photoshop fixes the problem anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. inexpensive and takes great shots. 
Cons:. so small its easy to lose. 
Summary:. This camera is great for the average person who doesnt want to carry around a big SLR but still wants beautiful pictures. The camera is so small that it is easy to misplace. at around 250 dollars after getting a memory card it is much less expensive next to similar 6 megapixel cameras. it is easy to get professional looking shots with this camera even if you don't have the most steady hand or the subject is moving. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great everyday way to capture a moment.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent image quality; very fast; tiny size; easy to use. 
Cons:. If I have to put a con, I guess the cameras with completely internal lenses are cool.. 
Summary:. If you're looking for an ultra-compact point-and-shoot, you can stop looking because this is the camera for you! I have had this camera for several months now and use it almost everyday. The images are excellent, the camera is very fast, and it even performs well in low light situations.. I use the camera everyday because I can. My old camera was so much bigger and I had to store it in a camera bag. This thing is so small I just slip it in my pocket and use it whenever I want. No hassle. The videos are pretty good too, so it's nice to have video capability at your fingertips as well.. Most users don't need more advanced features or higher resolution, so this camera makes things SIMPLE. And at $200 you can't find a better deal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great resolution, simple controls.. 
Cons:. Digitals eat battery power fast.. 
Summary:. We own a Canon Elph film camera and love it. It travels great. SD 600 is our first digital. It fits our use and situation perfectly. Simple to use. Travels great.. Sales person's expertise prepared us with spare battery and SD's. The resolution is very good. Use it everyday everywhere. Spare SD cards and battery store and pack easy. Still learning how to conserve battery power. Downloading pix is simple with or without Canon software. But Canon software program is very,very good and simple to use. This camera is very easy to use and maintain. Just like the Elph film camera, strap it to your belt and you're off and running.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, great pic quality. 
Cons:. wish it were faster. 
Summary:. I recently upgraded from the Canon SD450 to the SD600. I have always been a Canon fan and don't think there are many cameras out there that are as reliable.. The picture quality on the SD600 is of course better than the 450 and I have not had any complaints at all. The battery life is very good and we have taken it on 3-4 days trips and taken more than 200 shots and the battery is still good. I think this is the most important thing for us. The SD card interface is great as well - from camera to computer in a jiffy. I don't use the canon software - Picasa is the best way to transfer the images.. Only complaint if anything, I wish it were faster. In the right mode, it is quick but on Auto sometimes you are taking chances with the right moment!. I will still recommend this to anyone looking for a smart, sharp, small yet powerful digital camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. It fits in almost any pocket and takes great photos.. 
Cons:. Limited zoom range (3x). 
Summary:. Not just relevant to this camera, but why, oh why, do they bother with digital zoom? Does anyone use it?. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent picture quality, great price, nice metalic body. 
Cons:. zoom is only 3x. 
Summary:. i love this digital camera so much !!! i just got it a few days ago and i am starting to experiment with the coler accent and coler swap. the zoom feature could have been better but other than that this camera is the best!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact , crystal clear pix &#38; excellent shots of darker scenes. 
Cons:. View finder is so small I don't use it, but I know it's there in case I have a problem with the LCD screen. 
Summary:. I did A LOT of research before buying this little dynamo. I had to replace my Kodak 4 mp after I dropped it. I really wanted either the Casio Exilim or the Nikon but research convinced me to buy the Canon. The SD600 is amazing and truly compact.. I've never used manual controls for fear I didn't know what I was doing, but this camera makes it very simple by just skimming the instructions and playing with the features in various lighting and motion scenarios . Reviews said it just had the basic set of features, but I can't find anything that it's lacking.. I took pictures in Las Vegas in a dark setting inside a hotel with a show full of lights and moving everything, the pictures came out perfect. Also took shots of the Freemont Street Experience and again...perfect pictures. I have so many old pictures of a nighttime party where all the lights are streaming across the pictures...this camera DOES NOT do that when the settings are (easily) adjusted accordingly and I have yet to come across shutter lag that is noticeable to the basic user. You need to know when you want more light to come into your picture, you need to hold the shot for a couple of seconds, but isn't that common sense? It's not a camera flaw.. The LCD screen is big and can be easily viewed in the dark or in bright sunlight.. I've taken pictures of pictures using the macro setting and the result was worth making 5x7's for the rest of the family of a picture that I thought was long gone. I know I could have taken it to the KODAK Picture Maker but I wanted to test out the macro setting.. I've taken pictures of a baseball game at noon and at 6 pm and I've been able to catch a clear shot of the ball in the air and the ball connecting with the bat not to mention the batter running between bases.. The video is also great, no problems yet.. Only downfall is that I used the same 256MB SD card from my old Kodak that held 300+ pictures but with this camera and the various setting I've used, I recommend the 1G or 2G card. The first day I had it I had it set to large format photos and used the video setting and it only held 21 pictures and a total of 45 seconds of video. I quickly made the adjustment, but thought I'd share the info. On the normal settings I have ran out of memory yet, but I'm still buying the bigger memory so I don't run into a problem at the worst possible moment.. I was really concerned about the rechargeable battery and thought I'd need a back up, but so far so good. I don't need to spend the extra $40 for the spare battery.. I've highly recommended this camera to everyone that is even remotely interested in buying a new digital camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Value, picture quality, upload speed. 
Cons:. Poor bat/mem card door design. 
Summary:. Unlike another rater, I have no problem with multiple USB imaging devices being installed on my computer and uploading from this camera. The camera simply falls in queue and uploads when requested. Of course, any problem in this area could well be a Windows setup problem. I'm running XP Pro SP2 build 2600 and it's 100% patched. No idea about Apples.. I really have nothing bad to say about this camera, given it's price, I expect fewer bells and whistles. But as a P&#38;S I really would recommend it to even those who might be electronic gizmo challenged.. Cameras of this nature, and other electronic "kit" purchases, are always assembled to maximize profit. To that extent, you going to have to take care of the "extras" yourself. Extra battery, large mem card, carry case, and etc. are simply not going to be included in the base purchase. I feel this is an advantage in that it gives me the freedom to shop around for what little extras I want. I like deciding for myself, finding the highest value, reading reviews and all other activities associated with all my hobbies and avocations.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price &#38; Features. 
Cons:. For this price I can't find any.. 
Summary:. http://digital-camera-resource.blogspot.com/. This is another Canon that I plan to feature on my site. What a wonderful camera for the price &#38; features! Get it while you can : ). 

$$;
Pros:. great lens, exposure meter, superb macro, solid construction.. 
Cons:. haven't found any yet!. 
Summary:. first let me say I'm fussy, very fussy!. I'm not exaggerating when I say I've tried out about 8 cameras recently, all makes and price ranges of compact auto-focus digitals.. In Canada we have 15 days to try out a camera which is a damn good idea; I had almost given up on ever finding a camera to please me; thanks to CNET camera reviews, I saw that this little beauty had a great rating; it deserves it! I would highly reccommend this solidly built (Japan) user-friendly work of photographic art. I'm getting macro shots that bring tears to my weary eyes...and no, I'm not a Canon employee.... 

$$;
Pros:. Small size, excellent picture quality, large LCD screen, good battery life and some really nice features.. 
Cons:. Not many. Image stabilization would be nice but high ISO setting helps.. 
Summary:. Get this camera with the Cannon leather case, one extra battery, and a 1GB SD card and you are ready to capture a long vacation without wires. The high ISO setting really helps in low light situations.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Picture, Easy To use, Very Small, Have it own Battery. 
Cons:. Too Good to be True. 
Summary:. I just want to Thank Cnet for helping me purchase this product. The Review helped me so much more. The camera is excellent. The features, the size, the shots is great. I mean in pitch black the pics still comes out perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small Slick and Spectacular. 
Cons:. Scratchy LCD and digital zoom on lowers image quality. 
Summary:. Love the Canon SD600...really small and slick and yet can take amazing photos. I actually used it to shoot great quality photos that I used for a photography class!!. 

$$;
Pros:. small, large screen, high res, &#38; clear. 
Cons:. pricey and memory stick is a little small. 
Summary:. This is my third canon, and they keep getting better. Nothing is really wrong with this little camera. Best investment is purchase a 1GB memory stick. Can't go wrong with this one if you're looking for a small handy camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. First of all this thing is small and light and takes great pics. What more can you ask for. Haven't seen any mangled photos yet.. 
Cons:. Almost too small. WIll take some getting used to.. 
Summary:. I just bought this camera and I am very impressed. Very often, high tech electronics fail to live up to the expectations, leaving you with a bad case of buyer remorse. Not in this case. This camera seems to provide you with everything you would expect. I wanted a compact camera that would produce great 4x6 and 5x7 prints. That is exactly what I have.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Great picture quality 2. Fast speed 3. Quick startup time 4. Easy to use 5. Solid Construction. 
Cons:. 1. Comes with small SD memory card, but lets face it, who expects a camera to come with a large one. 2. Very small, this is good and bad. I worry about breaking it.. 
Summary:. This is the third digital camera I have owned. After purchasing a Kodak 2mp camera 4 years ago, I vowed I would never do that again. 2 months ago I purchased a Kodak Easyshare One for all the wrong reasons. It was cool, but the picture quality and menus stunk. This camera is ten times the camera the Kodak was. I love this thing. It takes awesome pictures, the menues are intuitive and it is solidly built.. 

$$;
Pros:. viewfinder, size, Canon quality. 
Cons:. none that I've found yet. 
Summary:. I bought this little camera to use when I didn't want to lug my bigger Nikon around. I love it so much, I'm actually considering selling the Nikon! It took fantastic shots right out of the box before I really knew how to use all the features. I went with the the 600 as opposed to the SD630 because it has the exact same features as the SD630, except for the fact that the SD630 has a 3" LCD screen as opposed to the SD600's 2.5" screen. But with the bigger screen, you get no viewfinder - and that was something that I wanted, because in certain shooting situations, a viewfinder is the better choice to use over the LCD. Plus the SD600 was $50 cheaper (which I spent on my SD card).. This camera is fun, easy to use, and takes wonderful pictures. I highly recommend it!. 

$$;
Pros:. All around quality, photos, software provided, size. 
Cons:. only 16MB card supplied, upgrade to 1GB. 
Summary:. I love this camera. Bought it online based upon the CNET reviews. I used it on a trip to the Oregon Coast and it produced excellent photos. Batter life is good, but Canon should provide a larger card upon purchase. Go out and get a 1GB card and you can shoot about 300 photos.\. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the software that came with the camera. Very easy to use.. The quality of the camera is outstanding. I love the large lcd viewer! My wife is jealous and wants one now..... 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, large screen, image quality, quick response time.. 
Cons:. No battery meter, but I'm very impressed with the battery life.. 
Summary:. I wanted a small point-n-shoot camera that I could carry with me. I had a Sony W1 and was frustrated with the slow response time between shots. Good camera though. I read all the review on this one and found that there aren't too many complaint. I agree.. I recommend a high capacity memory card however. The image quality is superb on the large picture setting it is also just fine on the other settings.. I love how quick this camera is!! I can power up and I'm ready to take the picture. No waiting on the flash, or loading settings. It's already there when I want to snap a picture.. Another great feature was the color accent and color swap. It's a bunch of fun!. Overall I would recoment this camera to anyone!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great performance,Very comact. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. I dont know much about cameras but i have to say that so far i love this little gadget. it takes clean and clear pictures and its also a video recorder.Its just amazing!Its so small you can carry it around like a cell phone.I also love the fact that itcame with videoaudio cable to plug right in to your tv so you can check out your pictures and videos. BUY THIS CAMERA!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Easy to Use, Great Picture. 
Cons:. a little clumsy with big fingers. 
Summary:. I purchased this camera from Buydig about 2 weeks ago and have taken several hundred pictures since. I am happy with its ease of use and excellent picture quality. Its a great camera for those of us that don't need a thousand different options, bells, and whistles. Its a simple, high quality camera..

Pros:. Great photo quality, high ISO settings, long battery life. 
Cons:. Slider is easy to inadvertently set to movie rather than still photo. 
Summary:. I'm a avid cyclist, and I needed a small digital camera that would easily fit in the back of my bicycle jersey on a recent bike tour in Colorado. I originally set a budget of $200 for camera and memory card. After reading many, many reivews and trying out several potential candidates at the local retailers, I decided on the SD600.. Some of the things that this camera had that others did not were: fast shutter response, fast picture save to memory (this was very important to me), lithum ion rechargeable battery, ISO800 mode, large LCD AND manual viewfinder. And of course mostly good to excellent reviews.. Bought the camera at Fry's as I needed it that day since I was leaving for Colorado the next day. Paid $346 for the camera, and also picked up a 2GB SD card that came free with an extra 512MB. So, 2.5GB for $69. With tax and everything it was $453 out the door. So much for that budget.. I have always bought cheap digital cameras in the past. I was immediately impressed by the vastly higher quality of shots I was able to take with this camera, even in low light situations. With lesser cams, low light pics are often pointless. Before leaving for Colorado I downloaded some of my pics to my computer and they looked stunning on my monitor (ViewSonic P225f, 22" flat CRT, 1280x1024 resolution).. Made a nice find at REI, a Timbuk2 carrying case that fit the camera perfectly and has a large vecro strap in the back. This allowed me to strap the case to the handlebars on my bike, making it easy to take on-the-fly photos.. The camera performed perfectly in Colorado. I was able to take many pictures while riding, although one drawback emerged. If you're not careful, the function slider can end up in movie mode instead of picture mode. I guess it probably slid over when I was taking it out of the case. I ended up taking at least 7 inadvertent movies on my 471 mile, 6 day bicycle trek. On the flip side, the quality of the movies is excellent when downloaded and viewed on the computer. With the 2GB card I could take up to a 16 minute movie, which is cool.. Battery life was great, I charged it the first day I had it, and then took at least 200 pictures in all lighting conditions before having to recharge again on the road in Colorado.. BTW, downloading pictures is a breeze. I haven't even taken the CD or the cable out of the box as the camera uses the same cable type to hook up to the comptuer that my blackberry does, so I just use that instead. You can look at all your pics in a folder in XP without having to install the software, so I don't know what all is on the included CD.. Overall I am really, really happy with my purchase. I am super glad that I did not cheap out this time. The difference between this camera and lesser ones is pretty noticable even for a novice like myself. If you want a small camera that takes great pictures with no unnecessary complications and no performance compromises, this is the one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Build and image quality, functionality. 
Cons:. Optical viewfinder is a tad small. 
Summary:. Being the Canon fanboy that I am with their multifunction photo printer(MP500), camcorder(Optura300), 35 m.m., and now my second powershot camera, I have been greatly impressed by this particular camera.. It's highly pocketable, very durable, as well as functional. The buttons are laid out in a logical manner and makes it easy to get to all the options and customization available. The screen is sharp, bright, and vivid enough to see it outside on a bright day. The all metal casing is durable and doesn't smudge. I also like the fact that all Canon cameras have a place on the side for users to attach a lanyard; it makes it much easier to carry the camera.. Now onto the image quality. What can I say, the pictures are terrific. All of my shots have turned out just bright enough and pefectly matched colors. Macro shots are great, but I use the optical viewfinder for better shots, it's very hard to frame what you're going to take correctly. Zoom shots look great and allow you to really capture detailed shots. The digital zoom is functional as the Digic II processing does a good job of smoothing out the picture for a usable and printable shot. I recently had a chance to capture some recent fireworks, and they also turned out amazing. The color swap feature is pretty cheesy, but I've actually had a lot of fun with it and have gotten some really good shots with that function.. You'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between a video from a low-end camcorder and this digital camera. There's no lagging on action shots. A complaint is that only the digital zoom is functional when in movie mode. This works fine, but it'd be nicer to zoom in with the Canon optics to avoid the noise when you utilize the zoom. It looks okay up until 4x.. Playback on the screen is much more enjoyable than my previous SD110. The screen is vivid and there are now transitions. The screen also automatically rotates the picture depeneding on your orientation of the camera. So now when you take a portait shot, all you have to do is turn the camera and you can see the entire picture on the entire screen as it was meant to be seen. The tv-out function is also nice allowing you to watch those movies, which really look like a camcorder shot the video.. The speed of this camera is also very nice. You can take several pictures at once without worrying about the camera being able to process in time. I've also yet to miss a shot as the camera turns on immediately.. Prints turned out great on this camera with my multifunction printer. Incredibly crisp and even looks better than chemical developing at the stores.. I found that the camera was very affordable as there were a number of rebates available for it at a local store, but with all the discounts online, this is still a very affordable camera especially since it shouldn't be outdated for at least another 5 years.. Overall, it's a great camera, although the optical viewfinder could have been better placed to avoid smudging the screen as well as bigger. If you have the money, spring for the SD630.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome photos! Small, compact with solid build quality. Fast continuous shooting. Great white balance and detail.. 
Cons:. None really. Scratched the back of the LCD after a couple of days. I should have put one of Fellowes' protective laminates on it sooner.. 
Summary:. I love this camera. I was struggling between this one and the Sony T-9, and although I like Sony's LCD better (seems smoother and sharper to me than Canon's), Sony's issue with excessive red eye and dust spots from the flash, plus the smaller lens and $100 more made me go with this one. An image stabilizer would have been nice, but not a deal breaker. I recommend this camera for its outstanding photos once you see them on your PC/Mac or in print!. 

$$;
Pros:. Pocket size, Excellent picture quality, Large LCD. 
Cons:. Small buttons, no battery meter. 
Summary:. I picked up this SD600 after checking out my friend's SD450 &#38; liking it. I was familiar with the nice picture quality of the Canons since I own an A80. The A80 is nice but very bulky (it was ok in the begining). The SD600 slips into a pocket with ease. This thing is so compact it's hard to tell you have something in your pocket - well... I like the large LCD screen. The pictures are razor sharp in the right mode. The built in video camera is great &#38; comes in handy at times. The array of functions like macro settings, color settings, attaching audio notes, etc. are all pluses.. Now the not so good: The buttons can be a pain being so small. I know they can't be gigantic but they could be easier on the fingers &#38; I don't even have large fingers. You can sometimes hit the wrong function by accident. Knowing how much battery is available would be nice. Hello Canon, where is the battery meter. A simple (pleather) case would have been nice touch to protect your new toy. Last thing... the BS memory card. Canon could have included at least a 64MB card- which is still not much. However 16MB holds about 8 picturs at good quality.. Overall though, you cannot go wrong with this camera. If you're still shopping you can stop now &#38; get the SD600!. 

$$;
Pros:. lightweight, compact, lcd + viewfinder, plethora of functions!!, crystal clear photos, high sensitivity iso, evaluative imaging!! aka, detects what is in foreground +backgound, panoramic photos. 
Cons:. no battery level meter, function menu a bit intimidating but still very easy to use. 
Summary:. canon has done it again with its sd600. it is truly one of the better top of the line compact cameras with a multitude of functions and settings and sharp, crisp image quality. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing image quality, easy to use. 
Cons:. Flimsy A/V out - usb hookup. 
Summary:. Got Best Buy to price match down to $300 3 days before I left for Portugal, Spain, France, England, Morocco because I could not decided between the 600 &#38; the 630. Played with both cameras twice in best buy and finally decided on the 600 as the resolution of the screens was identical- the 630's lcd seemed less sharp compared to the 600.. Extremely pleased with the 600. Also bought a Canon accessory pack containing leather case, metal neck lanyard, and spare battery for $55 bucks. Neck lanyard was godsend- I hate carrying large purse/stuff on trips- feel way too touristy. Leather case fit camera while on neck lanyard- very sturdy.. I don't know much about digital photography except that I had an old Olympus 2 MP and refused to take that- it still takes great pictures but it's heavy, large, and the AA batteries are constantly falling out of the compartment.. Besides using exposure compensation, macro, infinity, and reading 90% of the advanced user manual, steve's digicams and dcresource I have virtually no knowledge of digital cameras.. This camera is EXTREMELY easy to use. Switching modes from presets to manual, very intuitive - I had the hang of the camera in under a day.. I'm still a little befuddled by ISO other than basics of high vs. low - for low light pictures I found turning the flash off, setting the shot mode on continuous, and taking a series of 3-7 pictures typically presented 2/3 sharp pictures (I don't like the look of flash pictures in cathedrals, etc.), and then I'd erase the blurred ones later on.. I realized later on, that'd I'd seriously underestimated the number of pictures I'd be taking (rather idiotic of me since I'd taken a 3 week class in Egypt 1 year ago but also had my computer to dump photos) and filled up my 1 GB 80X Transcend card less than 10 days into the trip - 579 pictures on 6 MP &#38; Fine (Medium) detail setting. Bought another 512 card and filled that one with 3 days remaining - (put it on SuperFine for the Louvre).. Camera ran wonderfully - battery life probably around 1.5- 2 days for intermittent use, longer if you turn the LCD off and aren't constantly reviewing your pictures (I'm anal). Movie mode was spectacular - I took one of the Eiffel Tower in Light Seizure Mode (very rapid blinking) and it looks amazing (320x240 30 fps, 11 secs @ 7 MB) but it also filled the remainder of the 512.. Several other people had Sony cameras and camcorders - there were constantly having trouble getting them working correctly (one refused to turn on every so often, even if battery was freshly charged, one camecorder could not delete individual pictures). My canon worked so refreshinly easy and it syncs perfectly with my mac.. I did note one problem when try trying to import pictures onto my mother's intelMac - about 75% of the photos refused to import and gave a file corrupt error, whereas I had no problem on my 17" Powerbook 1 Ghz. Also, the Canon software would not install on the intelMac- I didn't see a notice on their website but I didn't look too hard- I'm guessing it's not Univeral Binary yet so one would have to rely on iPhoto.. Canon software works fine on my computer, only thing I haven't gotten around to doing yet is the "ImageStich" software - for combining pictures to make a panoramic.. Overall, I'm glad I got the 600 instead of the 630 - I can't image battery life being nearly as long it was on the 600, and for those few shots were it's so ungodly bright you can't see the LCD, the viewfinder was the perfect safety. I still can't get over how sharp the LCD on the 600 looks next to the 630 - another .5" really does make a large impact on resolution.. I would not recommend any other camera- I spent months researching the aforementioned sites and quickly decided against the casio z850 when I read about it's deplorable movie mode, the sony T9 looks pretty but I can't stand how aggravating they can be to use. Canon was a perfect fit for me and I can't see anyone not being satisfied with this camera.. Just be very careful with the A/V Out, USB Door- I noticed this on other reviews but since I tend to treat my electronics better than my boyfriends, I'm not worried.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp, saturated photos; quality build, size. 
Cons:. None really, just some nitpicks: a little shutter lag, uneven flash, shortish battery life. 
Summary:. I bought this great little camera almost two weeks ago and have enjoyed every minute of use. I bought it to sort of replace my 3 year-old Canon A80, which was getting left home more and more because of its bulk. I travel a lot and wanted a quality ultracompact that would take pictures of the same caliber (or better) as my A80, but be much more pocket-friendly. I considered a number of cameras: Canon SD4xx/5xx/6xx, Sony's T series, Casio's Z series, and Panasonic's FX01. I went with the SD600 for its photo quality, build, optical viewfinder, and being the Goldilocks for size: not too big, not too small, just right.. Thoughts so far:. The SD600 is has a nice little heft to it but is not too heavy, and felts like it's been machined out one piece of metal. For such a small device it feels nice and solid in hand. One-handed operation is fairly comfortable; though the case is a little on the slippery side. I see I'll have to be careful with battery/card cover: it's the one thing that feels delicate. The buttons are large enough for my average-sized male hands.. The camera starts up very quickly, and shutter lag is negligible under most conditions. Turning off the nine-point autofocus (AiFA), which leaves on the centered AF, speeds things up a little. Flash is strong in the center of the shot, but regardless of zoom, weak on the sides. Fleshtones on the whole are rendered warm and natural, but again, it can be a little harsh in the center. Redeye is present as often as not, but it's better than I expected. The flash cycles fairly quickly with a charged battery. Battery life is OK: about 140 shots in fine mode, some flash use, and heavy LCD use. Thank you Canon for making a small flat charger whose prongs fold flat!. While this ELPH's LCD is not stunning like some of its competitors, resolution and brightness are satisfactory in all but the harshest sunlight. Bearing in mind this is an ultracompact, the viewfinder is decent and a reason why I chose this over the SD630, Casios, and Sonys.. I am very pleased with the photos this little guy is delivering. There're enough scene modes, and the automatic settings produce consistent results. The camera's manual controls are somewhat limited, but it is a point-and-shoot after all. Still, there's enough manual control to improve on the some of the auto modes and get more shots. I've found the white balance modes rather useless but surprisingly have had better and even more natural results using the special color modes. In the auto modes, colors are nicely saturated and accurately rendered. Focus time seems about average. Autofocus with or without AiAF is precise, so images are crisp without looking 'hard.' Contrast and detail are very good. In the 4x6's and 5x7's I've printed out, I'm sure a trained eye would see some issues, but what counts is that my eye is delighted with the results!. In making up my mind, video quality was not a consideration. After playing around with it though, I like what I see on the LCD, but I don't have enough experience with video to comment one way or another.. This Canon is the best compromise for me: excellent photos, solid construction, and very pocket- and travel-friendly. Battery life could be better. That's true of alot of electronic products, but I can live with it because the battery charger is very compact. All in all, this camera has met my expectations and has not disappointed me at all. In fact, it's been a lot of fun to use and play around with, which I think is much of the point of this class of camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. EVERYTHING. 
Cons:. awkward video mode, no battery meter. 
Summary:. its a reallly great camera, and u'll do GREAT With it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact yet solid. Intuitive controls. Great image capture.. 
Cons:. Weak flash. No visible battery monitor.. 
Summary:. I wasn't sure what to expect with the Canon SD600. I had been using an Olympus 3030z purchased in the year 2001. I used to carry around the big case full of spare batteries, extra memory cards and RCA cords. I was ready for a compact. I bought the Canon based on the size, specs and its popularity. It has not disappointed.. The most surpising feature of the SD600 is the video. Amazing. I'm not sure if the technology has improved that much since I last shopped for a camera (admittedly 5 years ago), or if Canon does an exceptional job, but it is a joy to use. I almost use the video more than the stills.. My only complaint after two months of use involves the flash. It seems I wish it would fire more often in the automatic program mode. I know, the high ISO is supposed to compensate, and does. This will take some getting used to. And even when the flash does fire, I end up wishing it was a little stronger. Again, I realize that the compact form factor does not lend itself to a monster flash, so this will take some getting used to.. Lastly, I enjoy the software included with SD600 and recommend you get at least a 1GB SD memory card. (I bought a 2GB and love it.). 

$$;
Pros:. Awsome Features that will actually let you focus on one color of a setting and turn everything else black and white. Refer to the CNET review video. It actually works.. 
Cons:. Noisy start up with lens.. 
Summary:. It reads my 4 gb SD Card and allows 1500 to 10,000 phots on it. I also have the WD-DC4 waterproof case for it and works amazingly well. Cant wait to use it in 3 weeks in the dominican republic. I bought it for 236 dollars on preferredphoto.com. If you dont mind a little sales call(dont buy anything they offer, its over priced) they have the best prices.. 

$$;
Pros:. Exceptional Image Quality; Fast; Great Design; Simple. 
Cons:. So far I can't think of any .... 
Summary:. Now this is a great point and shoot digital camera!! It provides truly exceptional image quality with crisp, sharp images, vivid and true colors with superior zoom and macro features. It is fast too. Start up is quick and lag between shots is unnoticeable. It is simple to use and the price is very reasonable. I did a great deal of research before buying this camera (after having been 'burned' with the HP Photosmart R717). The expert and consumer reviews for this camera have been very positive, across the board. If image quality is important to you - buy this camera!. 

$$;
Pros:. Big Screen, Compact Pocket Size, Stylish ID. 
Cons:. No IS and No Battery Meter, but still a Great Camera. 
Summary:. I just bought my Ixus 60 one month ago. Found that it is really perfect and stylish. With the metal casing feel very solid when holding it. The camera can take good photo with good quality and good color without any problem when bright. But the problem for it is the Flash, the flash is still not good and strong enough. Another problem is the camera don't have IS. It will be problematic when take photo at night or when dark without using the flash. The photo will become blur when the higher ISO is using. Overall it is a great camera with the compact size for me as well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality &#38; user friendly.. 
Cons:. No image stablization; only 3x zoom.. 
Summary:. I bought this camera after a fiasco with the Kodak V570. Love the simplicity along with great picture quality. Really like the viewfinder for bright sunny days. Very compact and fits into my pocket.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact &#38; Powerful. 
Cons:. Yet to be discovered. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, easy to use, large display. When matched to a high speed SD card (ecost 133X) pic-to-pic and download times are extremely fast.. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. This camera was bought to replace our Canon A70 which was our 1st digital camera. It feels like we made the transition from dinosaur to speed racer! The SD600 is very fast, during start-up, pic-to-pic, and during focusing. With the DIGIC processor it's difficult to take a bad picture. The rechargable battery has worked great, lasting a long time even with extensive photo sessions. Definitely buy on-line for the price break.. We are so impressed that we bought one for our friend that is graduating from college!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, ease to use, lots of features &#38; ISO800. 
Cons:. A longer zoom would be great like 4X or 5X optical. 
Summary:. I paid 280.00 for the camera and had no complain at all. A lot of features and the Macro were great. I tested Macro function on a postcard portrait and every one seen the picture thought it was taken from a live model. The size was so compact that I could just carry the camera in my pocket all day long without even thought about it. I rated a 9 due to only 3X optical zoom. If it has a 4X or 5X optical zoom then it would be a perfect 10. Definitely recommended for any one wanted a compact camera for great picture.. 

$$;
Pros:. small size, large display, custom settings, solid construction. 
Cons:. USB connector cover poorly designed. 
Summary:. I replaced my older Canon S230 with the SD600. More options for movies, and "nifty" extras like "changing colors" make it more versatile. Overall a GREAT little camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fits into my jeans pocket, great picture quality indoors without-flash gives non-fuzzy pictures.. 
Cons:. None so far.. 
Summary:. I just purchased this camera a month ago for a vacation to NYC. I wanted to get a camera that could take good indoor pictures in musuems that didn't allow the use of a flash, and something compact.. This camera did not disappoint, with the ISO settings, and also the Stitch function, which allowed me to get a great panorama view of the Manhattan skyline.. The camera feels sturdy, and the LCD screen seems to have a coating that makes it hard to scratch. Ergonomics are great, and I never had it fall out of my hand while grabbing for it in my pocket.. The only thing I didn't expect is a high-pitched mechanical whirring noise when you power on the camera, and when you focus. This noise is in addition to the mechanical zoom in/out sound. The previous models did not have it, and I almost returned the camera because of this. I had to go down to Fry's to hear the floor model do the same thing, and also the SD630. I guess the new models all have this sound. Just a heads-up.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast start, Widescreen. 
Cons:. slim and small. 
Summary:. well i had the sd450 and that was also a good camera saw this in best buy liked it and bought it home amazing quality. love canon products would buy another camera soon maybe their Rebel. But BUY This. 

$$;
Pros:. portability, picture quality, optical viewfinder, easy controls, fast.. 
Cons:. some advanced options on digital menus buried a bit deep. 
Summary:. The key to great pictures is having the camera with you when opportunities arise. How many times do you not have the DSLR when a great shot is available. For those of us who don't have time to go looking for photo ops, the key is to have a camera thats always with you.. This one takes great shots in every kind of light (has ISO 800, is every bit as versatile as anyone but a pro could possibly need, and is one of the few in this size range to keep an optical viewfinder. That means that a single battery can last through an entire vacation if you use the optical viewfinder for daytime shots. I carry one spare battery, a 1 gig SD card, and can travel anywhere, taking hundreds of perfect shots, because the camera is always in a shirt pocket or on my belt, and I can go days without the need to recharge a battery.. Replaced a canon S400 which was also a great little camera. I never touch the DSLR.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact and Powerful Little Giant. 
Cons:. NONE except no WiFi. 
Summary:. If you are in the market for one, THIS IS IT!!! HAVE A FUN WITH IT!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Image Quality, Compact. 
Cons:. Flimsy Lid for Battery/SD Compartment. 
Summary:. Great little camera. Use my Nikon D70 when picture speed and quality a must. But I wanted something to carry around or put in the video camera bag. Made a good choice and Canon did well with making the choice easier. Very compact, good images, screen and options. Battery lasts quite a while and additional batteries not that expensive. Again not the perfections of a DSLR but when you want to have a camera with you at all times and will preserve the moments..This is a very good option.. 

$$;
Pros:. Photo Quality and Good Video. 
Cons:. Weak Zoom Capabities. 
Summary:. The photo quality is excellent and video is good considering the weak zoom capabilities. The small camera kicks big @#$. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use with good quality.. 
Cons:. would like to have manual functions but this is hard to find in any small camera. 
Summary:. Sorry, I disagree on the hard to download photos if you have a multifunction printer hooked up to Windows XP. I have no problem. I use Adobe Elements 2 to download very quickly. I also got a much better deal than the $599.54 price!. 

$$;
Pros:. Does what you need quickly, great battery life, has all you need for any point-and-shoot application.. 
Cons:. Back button printing wears off quickly, not so bad if you have keys memorized. Some vignetting.. 
Summary:. I've had this camera for about a year now, and I am impressed with its value. I've shot about 3000 pics through it cause it is small enough to carry everywhere. It makes taking tons of pics easy wherever you are. I took it to spain and took almost 400 pics in one day on one charge. had it in my pocket here in Iraq for about 4 months now, and this camera is a trooper. Had a nikon 4300 and it didn't hold up for a month with the fine sand in the desert. Taking alot of pictures of daytime cloudless blue skies revealed some minor vignetting. Nothing serious though. If you want an awesome camera for less than 250 dollars, I highly recommend this one, and despite the editors review, it has more features then they lead on. Took me awhile to discover them, but very impressed.. 

$$;
Pros:. takes great pictures, easy to use, feels well-built and durable. 
Cons:. no image stabilization, a bit outdated now. 
Summary:. I'm glad Canon chose this camera to replace my old IXUS v3 [for free!]. Having no image stabilization sucks [I have shaky hands, and there are a lot of times when I want to shoot without flash indoors], everything else is great. Camera design, software, and of course photo quality -- perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's small. It had lots of cute features and the pictures normally came out of good quality.. 
Cons:. The color accent feature was really complicated to use and didn't really work and sometimes the pictures would show too many details like every little pimple on your face would be highlighted.. 
Summary:. Overall, I really enjoyed using the SD600. It was cute and convient. The first few days I had it, I didn't like it but once I find the perfect setting. I fell in love with it. It takes thee most gorgeous black and white pictures and I absolutely love black and white pictures. The colors came out decent as well. My only compliant would be that the color accent feature didn't really work well and that was one of the things that had initally attracted me to the camera and sometimes it over emphasized things. Like once all of a sudden my camera become so detailed that when you zoomed in you could see every indiviual strand of your clothes. I would totally recommand this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent images, awesome colors,fast startup. 
Cons:. Red eye reduction dont seem to reduce much. 
Summary:. This is my first digital camera and I made an excellent choice.I did alot of research on digital cameras and found that the Canon Powershot SD600 is easy to use and very compact,fast startup and the images are great! I'm still learning to use the Canon Powershot and I love the idea of seeing the picture right away.The only thing is even with the red eye reduction on I still get alot of red eyes,I know it is made to reduce red eye and not eliminate it totally but 90% of my photos people had red eyes,maybe this is my fault, like I said I'm still learning, but all in all this is the best camera for me!. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, decent low light pics, big screen, some manual features, quick start-up time. 
Cons:. Not many "extras", flash too bright. 
Summary:. I bought this camera about 4 months ago, after having my old Cannon stolen at a Dodgers game. I wanted to stick w/ Cannon because I liked their interface, quality, and generally ease of use. For the price, this is an easy pic for a simple point and shoot. It doesn't promise anything huge but that's ok. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Take good quick pictures. My girlfriend uses it for more point and shoot and I've used it for slightly more advanced photography. While it doesn't have tons of features (no aperture setting) you can use it in manual mode to set ISO speed and shutter speed. Like most compact digitals, it doesn't handle low light all that well, but it does at least try. When shooting in automatic mode there are quick access buttons that you can set to no flash and another to high ISO if you want.. My biggest complaint with cannon point and shoot it the flash is way too bright. You can adjust it but it basically goes from super bright to still really frikin' bright. Id you're taking pics at anything less then 15 feet in, say, a bar environment you get your subject really washed out. I've actually taken to putting a little piece of white paper over the flash when I'm snapping pics to soften it a bit.. All this said, I love this camera. It's small, it feels very well made and I haven't had any trouble with it so far (I wouldn't expect any in only 3 months). Also I forgot to mention that its start-up time is incredible and same for the processing time in between shots. If you're looking for a quality camera at a good price, get this.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality. 
Cons:. USB cable won't charge the camera. 
Summary:. As I have a life, I'll only write a short review - I got rid of a Panasonic FX07 which took very poor pictures; especially compared to the Canon SD600.. No, this isn't the best or perfect like those other headlines would like you to think, but if you want a small digital camera for all around use, you won't go wrong with this camera.. And no, I won't complain about the small memory card included... get over it, they all come with small cards.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, fast takes. 
Cons:. No ZOOM/TRIM option on camera!!!. 
Summary:. This camera is fantastic, thanks to all the reviews, it is exactly what I was looking for in a digital camera, HOWEVER, there is no zoom/trim option on the camera itself. I had a sony cybershot before and this is one of the best features...that you can take a picture, then zoom and crop it on the fly on the camera itself, not so with the SD600. BUT, the computer software will allow it, although I had to figure this out on my own, Canon's tech support said it couldn't be done. They also said there is no zoom/trim on the camera itself, but I'm going to keep looking. I am going to be getting the Canon 6700D printer to print out the photos and even though they said there's no zoom/trim on the printer, I will look to double-check, they don't seem to know too much about their own products.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent options and spec's. 
Cons:. Couldn't find anything bad about it. 
Summary:. Found it for around $215 via a search on Froogle for "canon SD600 " and several stores on the net for below $250.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image Quality, LCD, Charger, battery. 
Cons:. No battery meter, No manual controls, samll optical viewfinder. 
Summary:. Excellent Snap Shot Point &#38; Shoot. I bought the SD600 to replace a 3 year old, but perfectly functional Sony 3.2 megapixel Sony Cyber-shot. The Sony worked but its images never seemed as sharp as those taken by friends and family, at the same events, with newer 5 to 7 megapixel point and shoots. When I hold both cameras in my hand the Sony feels like a brick. The Canon is half as thick, and third less wide (right to left), the same height, and considerably lighter. Canons sleek build did not come at the expense of a small or cheap lens, both cameras have f2.8 lenses that open up just as wide to let in the same amount of light.. One great but rarely mentioned feature of the Canon is its superb battery and charger. On the Sony the battery is not replaceable, you simply plug the camera into the charger. The Sony charger is a big brick with one long cord running into the wall and another long cord running to the camera. The Canon battery is about the size of three quarters stacked on top of each other, and it slides out of the camera, and into a small supplied charger (Canon product CB-2LV) that is the size of a closed flip-phone cellular. So what if the Canon does not have a battery meter, for $15.00 you can buy a second battery and have a charged spare ready.. This is camera is not perfect. Display and control of shutter speeds and aperture would be a nice addition to the SD600. I use a Nikon D70 for my serious photography, and the SD600 for when I do not want to lug around a bag full of photo gear. For users who want best of class image quality, shirt pocket portability, and design that would make Ipod and SubZero proud, this (or the SD700is) is the camera to buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large, brilliant screen; Great picture quality; Good features; Compact.. 
Cons:. No battery meter; No USB bus power; No EOS Utility support; Lacks a few advanced features; 3x zoom a bit whimpy.. 
Summary:. Well, Canon has done it again! Canon's new line of cameras is probably the best combination of aesthetics and functionality on the camera market today. It's like they put together Sony (who only focuses on looks and doesn't care if the pictures it takes are crap) and their older Canon models (which were the fattest, ugliest things ever, but took great pictures) into one slick product line.. This camera is great, but it's not perfect like many make it out to be.. Pros: This thing looks sexy! Large 2.5" screen that you have to see to believe. Bright and brilliant, it makes you wish they implimented this kind of LCD technology in everything digital. It boots up in about a second, which is great for those who like to turn it on just to snap a picture, and then keep it off to conserve battery. The pictures it takes are great, and there are a myriad of different features, which include several different kinds of presets for point-and-shoot photography in all sorts of situations. There are also manual features which can be tweaked to liking, such as white balance, color, exposure (contrast), ISO speed, etc. There is also a High-ISO mode for 800+ISO pictures, which can be handy for many situations. Also one neat feature is time and date input and time zones. Basically when you first boot the camera for the first time, you enter in the date and time and your time zone. Then, if you go traveling, you can set the camera into travel mode and select the time zone of your travel locale for instant time switching.. Cons: No battery meter! Is it just me, or do NO digital cameras these days have battery meters!? Sheesh, at least make it a menu item where you can check the battery levels! The camera also lacks some advanced manual features like aperture and shutter speed. On top of this, the camera requires battery power to operate USB transfers and does not draw USB bus power. The software bundle comes with Canon's EOS Utility (which allows some nifty features like remote capturing of pictures straight to the PC), but there's no support for the SD600! It kind of gets your hopes up when they bundle that software in there, and then it doesn't even work with your camera model. Also, the 3x optical zoom leaves much to be desired.. Conclusion: This camera is great, and if you can get over its few shortcomings, then it's for you. If not, then you can try checking out the Canon A-Series which I imagine would have a few more features, but slightly poorer picture quality. Overall, great camera, and another success for Canon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, quality and functions galore. 
Cons:. Poor manual picture quality. 
Summary:. So I lost my Canon Elph S230 and had to buy a new one. It was a no brainer to pick up another elph, because I loved my last one so much. Low and behold my lost camera showed up on my doorstep and gave me a chance to compare the two. This new model is substantially thinner and a bit shorter (~1/8"). The shot isn't that much better though. I thought 6 megapixel would blow away a 3.2 megapixel camera, but when you zoom in on photoshop, the quality is hard to discern. Nice video options and I like the high ISO800 feature. If you don't have a camera yet, this is a sweet deal. If your looking to upgrade, I would hold off.. 

$$;
Pros:. Durable, Good quality for a point and shoot camera, small/easy to carry with you where ever you go.. 
Cons:. Mine was run over by a car and I can't use the screen but other than that works great even with smashed housing.. 
Summary:. I found this camera in the street one day. It was wet and pretty muddy. I also noticed that it had most likely been run over by a car because it's body has been crushed and deformed. The screen is cracked and unusable. I took some pictures with it at a basketball game through the view finder, which is pretty small. The the pictures came out fine. I also took a few videos and they also came out fine and with decent quality but one of them did not record any audio. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with it's durability and I'm looking for a charger so I can use it as an everyday camera instead of my phone camera or Nikon D200.. This site lists this camera to cost about $549; that's outrageous. It's not worth that much as a point and shoot camera. I found this same camera for about $250 on another website. And considering it's durability, I would not be afraid to buy used.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact Size, Great design, LCD size, Picture Quality Good Most of the TImes. 
Cons:. Picture Quality Bad Sometimes, Poor Flash, Simple Features, Video Takes Up Storage Space and Wears Battery Out. 
Summary:. This was a great camera, and it managed to last a year longer than its warranty guaranteed. Then eventually flash stopped working and so did it's tolerance for low light.. The only issues that I had with it were the ones listed next to the "Cons" above.. Such as the Picture Quality: Flash is okay, but sometimes it adds too much contrast into a picture, but it's hardly ever blurry. Flash also delays for about three seconds--maybe longer--before it actually takes a picture, which is undoubtedly frustrating. Without Flash on, the pictures can come out blurry unless you have it on the proper ISO setting. Make sure you have a steady hand.. The problem with the videos is pretty minor. It doesn't take up too much space as long as it's a minute or less and the battery doesn't wear out too much faster. The video con was really just a warning.. Other than those things, the camera was great. The quality was good when I could get it to work, and it lasted two years.. It's a good camera, especially for not being one of jthe latest models.. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid feel, good picture quality, very portable. 
Cons:. Without stability control pics can come out fuzzy, indoor shots let down. 
Summary:. I have owned this camera for about 1 year. Overall, I am pleased, but I would have preferred a camera with stabilization after using it a while. Pictures can be fuzzy without them as any camera this small is also impossible to hold perfectly still.. Outdoor picture quality is stunning, colors vibrant, good contrast ratio.. Would recommend for the price (now much cheaper @ $230), but if you can afford better, do it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, easily fits in pocket; Takes good pictures;. 
Cons:. Uses special battery that requires a special charger (included).. 
Summary:. This is a good all-around camera, with a somewhat basic feature set. It would work well as possibly a first camera, or for someone who does not need a lot of complicated features found in high-end cameras. It fits easily into pockets, but forms a noticeable weight so you know its there. It sometimes struggles with pictures in low-light, but usually when the flash is switched off. When it is turned on, it takes good pictures in low-light. A neat feature I saw was when I went to an aquarium, it too pictures in windows without taking the reflection, heavily reducing glare. the one major pain I have with this camera is the battery. It is made by Canon, and is product-specific, making it hard to replace. Also, if you lose the charger, you're out of luck. it would probably be simpler if it used AAA or AA batteries, but perhaps it needs more power than that and the size of the camera is a major constraint in terms of that.. 

$$;
Pros:. small, quick, clear photos. 
Cons:. very basic camera!. 
Summary:. i purchased this because i needed a good point and shoot camera to take pictures of my daughter playing soccer, swimming, family vacation photos, around the house, blah blah etc..... and found this camera rocks! great clear quality photos, small in size and easy to use. when i need a quick photo and don't want to miss the moment, this camera does the trick.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact with a large screen. 
Cons:. Needs image stablization. 

$$;
Pros:. very quick, beautiful pictures, good options. 
Cons:. lcd screen problems. 
Summary:. Very good camera, beautiful pictures, very quick and responsive. I just have one problem with LCD screen. When in the dark and pointing at the light source, I get those vertical blue lines on the screen. They don't show up on the picture, but they are there right before you shoot the picture. Maybe somebody can tell me what these lines are.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, instant boot up, screen size. 
Cons:. Mimimum features, picture mode switch slides to movie when you holster, not the desired shoot mode. 
Summary:. I picked this camera to carry when I don't want to lug my Canon EOS 2D on travel yet still want the option of taking photos. Overall the quality is good, you just have to remember you're shooting without image stabilization otherwise you end up with a bunch of unusable photos. Basic modes are acceptable- auto, manual, macro, portrait, night, and a kids/pets shoot. The lack of a fast mode is somewhat lacking for action shots. The menus are intutive and offer help text automatically. The larger screen is a great improvement. Thumbs up Canon, no regrets on the purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. decent camera, nice tonal response, good controls. 
Cons:. lousy buggy canon software on mac. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek design, includes an optical viewfinder, nice photos, easy to use.. 
Cons:. Protective anti-glare coating peeled-off,no battery meter and no built-in memory.. 
Summary:. I have been using this camera for almost a year and am mostly pleased. My biggest gripe is when the protective anti-glare coating on the LCD screen peeled-off after a few months' use. It has an optical viewfinder to use outdoors when the LCD screen gets washed-out. Unfortunately, when using the optical viewfinder, the snapshots come out way off-center. What should be in the center of the photo shows-up at the very bottom or even gets cut-off. No crossbars are included. It must have something to do with parallax. As a result, I have to use the LCD screen even in bright sunlight. I am also not pleased that there's no way to check the battery strength so you don't know when the battery is weak until when an indicator finally appears. I have run-out of power as a result. I lost taking photos of the landing of the first Airbus A380 as a result. Now, I often carry a spare. I also wish that the ISO was higher than it is. The shutter lag seems to be slower than advertised. The auto white balance often must be adjusted manually. A backlight compensation switch would be nice, too. Overall, I am pleased with the camera although I fear that the battery cover and top toggle switch will one-day break-off.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great photo quality, big screen, good looks. 
Cons:. horrible menu navigation, super cheap battery cover, short battery life, cannot charge battery without removing it from camera and plugging into wall, no cradle, hard to hold, screen is too big. 
Summary:. Do not get me wrong, this camera takes very good photos. I've had it for a few days now, but will be returning it today for the following reasons.. 1) Build quality is NOT good like CNET says, I feel like I'll break it within a month.. 2)Battery cover will be broke within a year without question. Horrible quality.. 3)I bite my nails, to open the A/V cover to download photos is a nightmare!. 4)I have to take the battery out and plug it into the wall, why no other option is available is beyond me.. 5)Menu system is horrible. to get to all the good custom scenes take too long.. 6)the screen is SO large that its impossible to hold with one hand without putting your fingers all over it. 7)The camera is slippery, feel like I'm going to drop it.. 8)The LCD screen has the same pixel count as the 2.5" screen, making it pretty washed out in daylight.. If you can live with all these things, you've got your self a camera that takes VERY good photos. I just can't put up with all these cons. Probably the biggest one being that I feel like it is very cheaply made.. 

$$;
Pros:. Took pretty good photos for three years, but then a "lens malfunction" rendered it useless.... 
Cons:. ...and I really babied the camera. Turns out it costs $109 to fix. Smacks of planned obsolescence to me. Always a big Canon fan, but now I am wary of their products.. 
Summary:. Nothing is built to last anymore.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size; LCD Screen; Intuitive Controls. 
Cons:. Image Quality; Flash;. 
Summary:. I purchased this camera because I needed I wanted a model I could place in my pocket and because Canon always receives the best praise. I had previously used a Canon Powershot S50 and was delighted by its feature set and image quality even though it was a relatively old camera. But I must say I was disappointed with the SD600. The pictures just weren't that good. The camera was way too prone to blur. The flash left everything washed out, noticeably moreso than other Canons I've used. On the bright side, the camera is small, stylish, and boasts a large LCD and Canon's easy-to-navigate controls. I suggest purchasing this camera only if you want to have a camera that fits in a pocket and can be handy at all times. Otherwise, I'd look for another model (or consider one of the new SD's that uses image stabilization).. 

$$;
Pros:. small, sleek, good outdoor photos, big screen. 
Cons:. Blue lines/blocks around light sources, problems with Canon Customer Service. 
Summary:. I have only owned the camera for a few months, and for most of the time, it has been in Canon's repair centre. A few weeks after buying the camera, I noticed that there were blue lines and blocks around light sources (lights, candles, windows). It shows up on the screen and in videos, but not in photos. The blue lines and streaks are quite noticeable. I wanted to return or exchange it, but BHPhoto wouldn't accept it after 2 weeks.. I decided to get it fixed through Canon. I dropped it off at a Canon repair centre. The customer service representative took a look at it, and seemed to think it was a problem they could fix. They took 3 weeks to get it back to me. When I received it, the problem was still there. The repair form said that they replaced a defective part in the optical unit. After calling and asking them about this, I was told to send it back to them. After waiting another 4 weeks, they returned the camera to me without having fixed anything. The repair form said that there was nothing wrong with the camera. They compared it to other SD600 cameras, and wrote that it's normal to see such blue lines.. I have used the Canon SD550 and other digital cameras (Pentax) and I never noticed this problem. Is this normal? Or is there something defective about the SD600? I'm very disappointed about this, especially since it shows up on videos. I'm also very annoyed with Canon right now. I have barely used this camera, and I wasn't able to use it on my trip or on a few special occasions because it has spent so much time in their repair centre. If it's something they couldn't fix, I wish they had told me that a lot sooner..

Pros:. Small size, large screen, durable casing, cool manual mode features. 
Cons:. Poor flash, zooming needs major help, video sound quality sub par, blurry images when viewed at full size on your PC, drains battery. 
Summary:. I got this camera as a pocket size, on-the-go camera and I chose it over the Sony in the same size class. At the time there were no user reviews so I made a gut choice but since I have had three months of use and the list of cons keep growing larger.. It's great for taking portrait photos of people in dark places as long as you're not more than 10 feet away. However, even the night portrait mode at moderate light is very sub-par and often blurry when viewed on a large screen. The optical zoom is decent and you can usually snap a few clean shots but if you use the digital zoom forget about it, it's going to be blurry even in the best of light.. Another reason I got this camera is its abilities to take high res videos. At 30 fps and 640x480 on a 512 mb card you may be able to get 5 20 second videos. I have to take it all the way down to 15 fps 320x240 to be able to actually use the video and take pics, but the videos come out ok if you're at the right distance and lighting. Another cool feature was the ability to zoom while recording but if you do, the camera doesn't auto-focus so you get a crisp image at first and it goes blurry as you start to zoom. Also the audio on the camera seems to be way too amplified and while it is good for indoor personal home video recording, if you are at a concert, club, or any other venue where there's bass, the audio comes out terrible unless you're far away from the stage. It would have been far too logical for Canon to provide you a way to turn the mic down on the audio.. All in all, if you are going to be using this camera to snap photos of friends that are close in proximity then this is a great buy. But if you want to take videos of events, distant photos that require zoom, or if you can't hold a camera perfectly still while snapping then you might want to think about another camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. great camera, slim design, quick shutter speed. 
Cons:. doesnt show battery life, really basic features, and somewhat crappy picture quality.. 
Summary:. so i just bought my canon sd600, used it, liked it, dont love it. my nikon 5.1 megapixel camera seems better then this. first of all, its farely slim, thats the reason why i bought it, but what was i thinking, everytime i take a picture without the flash, it blurs up, it shows all the pixels, its like its on the lowest quaility but i donno how to change it. but when you take a picture with the flash on the quality is amazing. im not sure if its like this to all sd600's or just mine but its really getting me mad. im using my nikon until i figure this out.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fun to take pictures with, great lcd screen, not bad on the lag time. 
Cons:. Bleached out images, lack depth, strange shadows, and white blotches on some photos. 
Summary:. This is a fun camera to use, it's very compact, but I was disappointed with the image quality... 

$$;
Pros:. Takes good pictures. 
Cons:. Difficult to operate. 
Summary:. Poor documentation manuals and poor online pre-printed materials. This is a technological marvel and takes good pictures, but I spend too much time figuring out how to do things. Navigation is poor with obscure functions at top.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, small. 
Cons:. Many. Read on:. 
Summary:. While I think this - and other Canon cameras as well - is a very good camera overall, it is well behind other cameras in many aspects:. 1. LCD Resolution: While the 175,000 pixels is much better than previous Canon elph models which features just 118,000 pixels, it's still way behind other cameras which offer 230,000 pixels (Kodak, Pentax, Sony, and others). (And they still use the lower 115,000 pixel LCD on other cameras, S80, A700, etc.). 2. Video is captured in uncompressed AVI format - which will allow for a mere 8 minute high quality video on a 1 GB card - while other cameras use compressed formats (MPEG or QuickTime) which allow up to 1 hour of high quality video.. 3. Optical zoom is disabled during video recording, only digital zoom is allowed. Other cameras (but not many) would let you zoom in &#38; out OPTICAL during video recording. The digital zoom is really bad and isn't worth to try.. 4. The camera is pretty fast, but some other cameras (especially the Casio Exilim EX-Z750 I recetnly tested) is much faster.. 5. Battery life is only adequate. The Casio models are much better.. 6. Controls are very tiny even for small hands, leave alone bigger hands. Again, the above-mentioned Casio has controls which is much superior to the Canon's. (Canon's controls was much better in the past with smaller screens, as the SD300).. Some other options I found in other cameras not available on the Canon: Small lamp to illuminate dark areas when recording video or for shots without flash (Casio, Kodak); magnify videos during playback (on Canon cameras, "Cannot Magnify!" comes on the LCD when trying); see a bar during video playback, similar to you media player on your computer so you see graphically the length of your clip, and where are you now(found on Casio and Fuji cameras); Battery meter (found on Casio models.). To summarize, I think that Canon needs a lesson from other manufacturers, that besides good picture quality, they leave so much to be desired..

Pros:. Great pictures. 
Cons:. No low battery indicator; symbols rub off. 
Summary:. This is my 2nd Canon Digital Elph camera. Both the prior model and this model take great pictures. I upgraded for a higher mp and smaller size which this model featured. While I would be tempted to give this model a much higher rating (based on picture quality and ease of use), one major flaw and resulting Canon customer service keeps me from doing so. That is, the symbols around the function dial in the back seem to be pressed on rather than etched into the dial. After less than a year of moderate use, my symbols have rubbed off and I can no longer tell what the buttons are for. Since the camera is under warranty, I sent into Canon for repair, but much to my surprise, was told that my camera had a dent in it which shows that the camera has been dropped and thus, the warranty is void. I was shocked, since my camera is in pristine condition! I went round and round with the Canon service rep on the phone because I refused to pay...$115 (!) to have the camera fixed and they refused to fix it under the warranty. I finally told Canon to send the camera back to me and I am hoping that Costco will stand behind the camera. I have owned 3 Canons in the past and because of the lousy customer service and problem with this camera, I will probably never purchase one again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice camera while it worked. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. Camera broke after six months, fixed by Canon, then broke again two months later.. 
Summary:. Canon charged us $107 to fix the camera after six months of use. When it stopped working two months later, Canon wanted $107 to fix same issue. We passed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful styling....sturdy looks. 
Cons:. 2-broken lcd's and blue line of death. 
Summary:. In the last 6-months I have had to have the lcd fixed, not once but twice! I also get the infamous blue lines of death in low light shooting and on the videos. I really wanted to like this camera but can not recommend it due to the above faults. Up until this camera, I have never had an ounce of trouble with any of my cameras. I may have gotten a bad unit but Canon fixed this the first time and went over it, in their words: "with a fine toothed comb" and it broke once again at a football game in which my brother was playing. I should give it a "zero" but won't due to the fact that so many others have evidently gotten a better made unit than mine. All I can review though is the unit that gave me nothing but trouble.. 

$$;
Pros:. Canon is always a great camera..but... 
Cons:. Error E18 will likely turn up..beware!. 
Summary:. This looks identical to my Canon IXUS 700, so will likely suffer from Error E18 at some time..ie the jammed lens. Before you buy, look at Error E18 on CNET or Google for it, then think again.... 

$$;
Pros:. Takes great pictures, fits easily in your pocket. 
Cons:. connection problems with Windows XP. 
Summary:. Hate to give this camera such a low rating other than to draw attention to a major compatibility problem with Windows XP.. First the PROS: Great small size, sturdy casing, takes great pictures even on Auto which is easy to set, has more features than anyone should need in what for most will be a carry-in-ur-pocket point-n-shoot camera, great LCD (this is the first camera that I actually prefer to take photos via LCD but the viewfinder is a great backup for those sunny outdoor shots where all LCDs get washed out). And has a neat color adjustment feature, that u can alter/correct a photo, save it as a duplicate rather than overwrite the original so when you download you can choose which is better, the original or the altered one. Can save you time by not having to use Photoshop later.. CONS: And this is a major one. Impossible to download to Windows XP if you have another camera, scanner or multi-function printer/scanner connected to your computer without first disconnecting all those other imaging devices &#38; rebooting your computer. And I dont mean WHILE youre using those other devices, just if theyre connected to your computer is enough to prevent this camera from downloading. And this is a pain if all you want to do is download a few pictures &#38; get back to work. This is because Canon wants to hog that device manager and wont share with other imaging devices. I have multiple cameras, scanners, printers &#38; a multi-function machine and they all co-exist happily except the Canons which wont share. Canon tech support knows of this defect and even mentions it in a small paragraph buried in the manual but since this is a known problem with all Canon imaging products, it should be noted in bold print on the box so you see it before you walk out the store.. However its an easy fix: buy a memory card reader for $40 but that means youll never use all the download features of this camera.. And while Im at it: no battery meter. All you get is a warning icon when the battery is low which only gives you a few minutes to change batteries. And since you cant leave the battery in the charger more than 24 hrs, this means if you dont use the camera regularly, and you dont have 90 mins advance notice to charge the battery before you walk out the door, you always need a backup battery. Another $40.. So, this means youll constantly be opening &#38; closing the cover protecting the battery &#38; memory card to remove &#38; change them and the cover/hinge are not that sturdy. I fully expect that to break one day so make sure you buy this camera from someone like Costco that has a no questions return policy.. And a final minor point  comes with a pitiful 16mb memory card which only holds 10-12 photos so count on buying more memory before walking out the store. Another $40. Most will do this anyway with any camera. But come-on, for Canon it would only cost a few dollars more to include a 256 or at least a 64mb card. How cheap can they get.. In short, be prepared to spend another $100 to overcome this cameras shortcomings. But unlike other cameras, at least this cameras problems can be fixed with more money. And if you can afford it &#38; can work around these problems, it's a great camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small and looks good. Great for those that buy service contracts at the electronics store, because it will pay off on this camera. 
Cons:. So delicate you will eventually end up with the lens that will not retract. 
Summary:. I have 2 of the powershots. First was the SD600... lens stuck open. Fixing is more than the cost of the camera, so I go buy a SD1000. Gues what, same thing in the next couple of months. Buyer beware, if you don't carry this in a velvet box and take pictures with bubble wrap surrounding it you will have a lens that will eventually not retract.. 

$$;
Pros:. Handy size, nice menu and selection setup. 
Cons:. MAJOR: really needs flash for indoors, eliminating "warmth". 
Summary:. I loved the feel of this camera, owned it for two weeks, then returned it to Amazon (no hassles!). I hate to throw hot water on all the rave reviews, but, I'm sorry, this camera cannot take indoor pictures using room light only.. As you take each picture, a little red alarm starts blinking in the lower left of the LCD screen, telling you that there is not enough light unless you increase the ISO, use a tripod, or turn on the flash. I did increase the ISO, but it still blinked. Every indoor picture I took over two weeks in several settings was of poor quality. I finally relented and turned on the flash. The pictures were okay, but washed out; they lost the warmth of the scene .. lights on the Christmas tree, etc.. I have come to the conclusion that one should not purchase a camera this small which does not have IMAGE STABILIZATION (IS).. I did more research, and also went down to Target and Best Buy to feel out other cameras, snapping a few pictures right there in the store. As a result, I am ordering the Panasonic TZ1 today. It's exactly the same price at Amazon, but it has IS, and also a 10x optical zoom! It's a little bit bigger, for sure, but is still quite "pocketable.". Again, I'm sorry, but what good is a camera which cannot capture the feel of your subject matter? And, incidentally, the same blinking occurred in the store with this camera (with the flash turned off), even under those bright fluorescents. And, in case you�"re wondering, I do not have the jitters or shakes in any form. Good Luck.. 

$$;
Pros:. none due to the fact that it didn't work!. 
Cons:. name it........................... .............................. ... 
Summary:. Purchased at Target (which ripped me off for $299 when it is available for much less elsewhere), and right out of the box displayed blue lines on all the pics. Took it back and this time the pictures looked great until the lens decided to not retract! This camera and the headaches that I have had as a result are mind boggling. Two defective cameras? Maybe but I've had enough. How many cameras do I need to buy before EVERYTHING works? This camera deserves a "zero" but C-Net won't let me go that low.. 

$$;
Pros:. Canon Brandname. 
Cons:. To Many to List. 
Summary:. After returning three of these units to OfficeMax for replacement (which were defective also), and testing four more in the store which were also defective, I would tell any person to steer clear of this unit. Make sure your crosshairs are centered in the viewfinder, the AF Assist Beam centers in the crosshairs, the Digital Macro mode actually works without blurring images, and that the ISO 800 and image stabilization work. In other words, check every aspect of the camera for features that are working correctly. Also, the paint on the slider for the battery/SD compartment will begin to chip off soon after purchase (design flaw in my humble opinion). Should have made it metal and not plastic. The bottom line is that there were problems with every camera in OfficeMax when I tried to make the purchase..
