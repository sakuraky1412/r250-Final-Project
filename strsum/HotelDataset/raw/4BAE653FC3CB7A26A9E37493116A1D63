this large hotel is centrally located in old san jose very close to the picturesque okayama park ( it was the original airport ) and around a 30 – 40 minute walk up central avenue to the plaza de la cultura , the national theatre and the national museum of costa rica .
we enjoyed this modern and well-situated hotel but disliked the constant noise .
we were given a large luxury suite for the two nights we stayed here on the 8th floor .
unfortunately , with only thin pane windows on two sides of the suite , we found our room very noisy from the street traffic and city noises which seemed to go all day and most of the night – you have been warned .
the constant noise was unfortunate as our room was pretty amazing with wifi , a comfortable king size bed , coffee maker with bar fridge , safe and a great huge bathroom with a great shower .
breakfast was pretty average but they had several hot and cold choices .
of course , the coffee is excellent in all costa rica .
the 180 degree view from our room was impressive and the surrounding mountains are pretty but the city is pretty drab .
most of the buildings are one or two stories as the city is prone to earthquakes .
san jose seems like a pretty safe city ( including the areas around the hotel ) if you are careful .
do watch yourself crossing the streets as the drivers are . . .

do watch yourself crossing the streets as the drivers are aggressive and there are walking hazards like concrete rain ditches and uneven sidewalks everywhere .
there are many great costa rican restaurants and many other restaurant flavors in walking distance of the hotel .
this would have been an excellent hotel except for the constant noise.
