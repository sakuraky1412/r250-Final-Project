i was looking forward to a good rest and happy prepare to return home trip by checking in 2 nightsbefore i catch my plane back home .
i arrived at the rome airport hilton way pass mid-night as mybusiness partners were very kind to me .
the receptionist miss giulia was very kind and immediatelygave me a nice room , while the bell boy justin did all he can to help me .
i checked into my room , fullysatisfied until i try to make tea for myselfand switch on the telivision . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
i could not find the socket , to plug in and the t.v was not working but miss giulia tried to help by calling the maintaince guy .
this guy arrived . . . . . . . .
tune the telivision correctly the tell me to make tea by plugging into a plug next to the toilet on the floor .
i was shocked , is this the hilton standards lately ? ? ? .
so , i told the maintaince guy definately not .
then , he started to move the little fridge and suddenly found a plug .
therefore , things got back to normal after 30 minutes .
but there are many things going on in this hotel that needs to be done .
the next morning , i went down to breakfast . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
imagine where the manager on duty put me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
on the walk way , near the buffet .
ofcourse , i suggest to the manager that i would like another table but he insist , that he wasfully booked and he needs that table for some coming guests .
therefore , i had no choice but to seat on my given table .
in all hotels , atleast to the ones , i have been in half the world , all hotels welcometheir guests to take pictures of their lovely buffet breakfast , their wonderful atmosphere but to my surprise , pictures were not allowed at the hilton in fumicino airport .
immediately , it came to my mind , what are they hiding that they do not want the world to see ? ? ? .
this time , i will not write the name of themanager on duty on the 2nd of may in the morning breakfast but ican say this , it is not nice to be aegoist and think that u can get away with it .
anyway , my day was ruined and i regret that u have tarnish the good name of the hiltons .
the breafast buffet was good but , we are not poor travellers from asia .
as proof , look at the pictures for yrself .
