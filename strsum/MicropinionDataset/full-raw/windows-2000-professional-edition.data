some people say the boot time is slow  .
this entirely depends on the number and type of applications you have starting at boot    up  .
turn your messengers and spoyware programs on manually , once you have entered windows  .
(i also suggest the use of a file eraser to keep your pc fast)  .
my boot    up time is about 60 seconds for stability and speed , this os blows away both windows 98 and xp  .
it is particularly good if you refuse to give up your piii  .
do i want to go out and spend a grand on a new tower that is capable of handling windows 7  .
heck , no  .
don't believe the hype  .
with windows 2000 , you get what you need , without all the junk you don't it will not accept ie7 , but with firefox , who needs ie7  .
(ie6 is still my main browser)  .
with a broadband internet connection , a file eraser and registry tool , as well as frequent defragmentation , my windows 2000 system is much faster than a lot of my friends' xp and vista systems  .
admittedly , this has a lot to do with configuration , but i guess my ultimate point , here , is that for the casual surfer and word processer , there is a lot being offered , these days , that you just do not need  .
i run it on a 600mhz processor with 640 ram and a 15g harddrive and i could not be happier  .
i read the horror stories about other , newer systems and just cruise on by .
microsoft should consider how much their users prefer this system when creating windows 7 .
for me it now windows 2000 professional now plays a utilitarian roll on my home net work  .
(internet connection sharing , file storage/retrival computers ect  .
) it is by me trusted due to it's stability and speed and ease of use  .
i could not say enough  .
of all the microsoft bashing people must have ignored windows nt completely  .
more stable than windows xp will ever be , i have found windows 2000 pro to be a truly dedicated os that will run contemporary software , most games (despite it's business    class) and will allow you to compute with confidence with it's intuitive win9x interface , it looks ready to go without being daunting , yet it is not win9x by a long stretch  .
based entirely on 32 bit windows nt , microsoft squeezed every little hint of dos out of this os , and it is such as good os , that they based the windows xp operating system on it the uptime is easily server    like and reboot is only necessary when you configure a new device , make a big registry change or hack the hack in msconfig  .
what i said in my summary  .
ignore the folklore about ms instability  .
the only thing i would recommend before connecting to the internet is to turn off the windows messenger service , either in the services applet or via this website   http  //www  .
grc  .
com/stm/shootthemessenger  .
htm  .
other than that , windows 2000 sets the ultimate goal in stability , security , usability , and proven dedication  .
well done , ms  .
microsoft windows 2000 professional is the best microsoft os to date  .
it does run a little slow and takes up more room then microsoft nt workstation 4  .
0 on a pentium ii 200 mhz , but that is to be expected since nt 4 is from 1996 and w2k is from 2000  .
anyways i recommened this to any nt 4 user that has a 150 mhz pentium with 64 megs of ram  .
i recently upgrade my pc from win98se to win2000pro  .
soo far i think its the best , coz i try winxppro it didnt give me good result plus it take a long time to upgrade although i must admit its kinda slow in booting time but usualy i dont boot , i just hybernate my pc .
i built a computer about a year ago , and installed the full version of win2000 pro  .
my system has never crashed once  .
i've had programs lock , but all i had to do is hit the windows key on the keyboard to get back to windows the system has never locked , honost  .
although , i've heard it's not for gamers , i have 27 different games installed of different types all run great , even the old ones  .
some software makers recommend windows 2000 pro over windows xp pro  .
i would recommend it to anyone who has a good understanding of computers (it does require more knowledge of computers and operating systems than win 95/98/winme) .
intuitive interface , stable performance , what else can i say  .
so much better than 98 , delivers what xp promises .
i've been using windows 2000 professional at home for about 4 months now and i have never gotten a bsod or hard crash  .
also i can protect my files and folders with win2k's security features and ntfs  .
these are degrees of security and stability that no win9x or me user will ever experience  .
i highly recommend this os to businesses and home users .
this os is the best out there  .
all of my programs run so nicely on it    solidworks , adobe premiere , photoshop , and all my games run so perfect on it  .
there is nothing wrong with it , though , i like the look of xp , but i can give up look for quality  .
device drivers can be found at http  //www  .
driversguide  .
com for any machine .
i used to have windows me and it almost destroyed my computer and my sanity  .
but eversince i changed to win2k , my sanity is back and my notebook works fine  .
it is more friendly than i expected  .
i use celeron processor , yet win2k seems to work just fine  .
if you are frustrated with 98se and/or me then change your os to win2k .
i do not like most m$ products , but i do have to admit that this is by far bettter than 95    xp  .
it's familiar and it's stable  .
also , diablo ii and everquest work well with it  .
i like how it's a m$ based os that actually uses all your ram and speeds the performance of everything up  .
i have to give credit where it's due , windows 2000 actually made me happy .
i will never go back to a 9x after using this os  .
best os microsoft has written to date even compared against xp pro  .
if you want an operating system that is flexible , reliable , and can do all you want here it is  .
i found that it can also run many games  .
do not mess with windows xp  .
2000 pro is the way to go .
windows 2000 is awesome  .
its really fast , and runs smoothly  .
once it boots , it runs faster then 98/me  .
even more stable then windows nt 4  .
upgrade  .
its worth it  .
i've been using windows since win95 , the main problems were stability , now , with 2000 , i have not encountered even one crash , i've been using it for 6 months now , even win me has crash problems , long live 2000  .
best os ever  .
instlled xp and really like it  .
if you rate xp under 3 , i guess you never use it .
best os  .
it workes better than winxp winme  .
do not ruin your time money with winxp .
this is the best os so far  .
i have used all the os from 3  .
11 to today and this one beats all of them  .
i have had it for a year adn it crashes far less than any os i have used  .
plus its secure  .
i can keep my stuff private  .
whoever said xp is better is full of sh t .
i used every single os by microsoft from 3  .
1 and up i haven't used a os better than nt , i thought , until i installed windows 2000  .
i have used it for about 2 years now and it has not crashed once  .
i used 98 both first edition and second edition and i almost ended having to buy a new computer  .
i used me and couldn't get anything done  .
i also heard about the new xp and how good it is  .
but when i installed the professional edition , i could not believe how much space it took on my hard drive  .
2gb  .
, it is a rediculous amount of hard drive space  .
i also needed 128mb of ram to ran it  .
simply outragious  .
after getting everything set up on xp , now i have to worry about the bugs and cracks all over the place  .
even after service pack 1 windows 2000 has been the best os microsoft has ever produced  .
the os has none or at least none cracks or bugs i have expericed yet after installing the service pack 1 and service pack 2  .
if your computer meets the minimal requirments for windows 2000  .
i really suggest the upgrade .
xp gave me heartaches and crashes and bsod  .
so i went back to win 2000 (sp3) and i never looked back  .
this is great os  .
i started on computers with dos which i loved  .
i have used windows 3 , 3  .
11 , 95 osr2 , 98 , 98se , windows me (forget that one) , windows 2000 pro , windows xp (on computers i have worked on  .
) windows 2000 pro is the operating system for me it's looks , ease of use , no blue screens it is stable .
i had w2000 for two months and i have yet to experience any crash  .
this os is simply fantastic  .
you gotta have it  .
you will not regret it .
with nt backbone , w2k is the most stable windows ever , including xp  .
2000 has only a few stupid badly    made , useless , full of bugs , features  .
unlike 98 everything that went in works  .
also , operation never slows and if it does with an instant alt , ctrl , delete it is easy and fast to quit programs  .
there is nothing like it  .
i had windows 98se and me and they regularly lock    up or freeze for no reason  .
windows xp better than 2000  .
please if you own old hardwares and softwares , xp is a nightmare (just read some of the user reviews in cnet)  .
win2k may not be flash as xp , but it sure is stable and friendly to good old hardwares and softwares  .
the some of the problems people have with win2k can be easily corrected by clean installing and not updating  .
win2k is still the best os  .
i can think enough of people who are installing windows xp home or pro edition on their computer this is just bad i use windows 2000 for gaming and sirf the net and i want the best possible optimized performance for my computer so i use win 2000  .
forgot about me , dont talk to me about xp if you dont want to upgrade , choose win 2000  .
or , stick with 98 .
a good stability , quick and also vrey complaint with the most aplications , software and drivers  .
a must to have  .
i use my pc for gaming , multimedia and surfing  .
my first os is 95 , good at it's time  .
win98 is a big improvement over it  .
stable and easier  .
i've used 98 for three years  .
then came winme (the dreaded)  .
i formated my pc to install me  .
after that i had to format every three months or so  .
it is a huge disapointment  .
totally worth less cause most of games ran very slow on that os  .
my friend recommended win2k for me and i tried it out  .
sure i had to upgrade my drivers , but it is amazing  .
interface is as smooth as me but whole lot faster and stable  .
never crashed  .
all my newer games plays faster on win2000  .
i love it  .
also good choice for families where kids also use pc , and you're afraid they might kill your pc  .
profile managment is as good as winnt  .
note   some older games may not run on win2k  .
so dual booting in win98 is an option .
i love this os  .
i used to run windows 98 and is afraid to upgrade because of poor games support  .
when i finally did , i is impressed at how well it did run games  .
sure , i had to spend some time getting some new drivers but that time is well worth it  .
two words   task manager  .
i recommend this os to anyone who wants to fall in love with their computer all over again .
i am again and again amazed by win2k  .
over the last three months the system has never had a fatal error , and i as more and more product updates comeout for it , i am able to play all the games i ever wanted  .
about the only problem that i really have with it is the fact that it takes a minute to boot , and only a minute  .
from what i have been reading about xp i will not upgrade  .
win 2k is where i am staying for now .
i is able through work to go to microsoft's xp training seminar  .
i think this is their best attempt so far (even though the requirements are a bit hefty    but then again , all the new systems out nowadays should support it)  .
microsoft overhauled the os a bit added cd creation capabilities , dvd through decoder , an unzipping program built in , customizable desktop , more stability , and much , much more too numerous to mention here  .
and the very controversial activation is nothing spectacular at all  .
microsoft been doing it for years and just started it here in the u  .
with office xp  .
if you have an internet connection , you're activated in mere seconds , if that long  .
i say if that's what they have to do to prevent piracy , then so be it  .
take it and run with it  .
according to microsoft , you can put it on another system , you just have to completely uninstall it from the system it is previously on  .
simple as that  .
i'm impressed by xp and to those of you who obtain it , you'll be too .
in my opinion definetely the best windows of them all  .
i have used windows 95/98 se , me , xp both home and professional and windows 2000 professional is the best of them  .
it's stability is impressive (pretty much the same as windows xp , they use the same system 'nfts') its speed is awesome except for booting the computer (start) which is kind of slow but not very (faster than 98's)  .
it still has the windows classic style which is much more comfortable than the 'new' xp style in my opinion  .
it takes less space in your disk than xp does  .
the only 'bad' of it is that it doesnt come with the windows media player that actually is a player (it comes with the 6  .
4 version) and other features that come with xp  .
do not think that xp's features are that good , for example the new feature in xp called 'movie maker' is a joke  .
xp comes with things that you dont even use  .
i discovered that after installing both xp and 2000 in different partisions , i entered windows update and guess what windows xp has like 35+ 'critical' updates while 2000 has less than 10  .
xp comes with ie (internet explorer) 6 while 2000 with ie 5  .
there are almost no difference except for 'screen fit' which sets the picture in the windows size  .
but if you would like to have that feature you can download it to 2000 but i dont recomend it because you will need to update + more 10    20 critical updates to it  .
windows xp vs  .
windows 2000 , 2000 wins easy  .
best windows ever .
i've had windows '98 , me now for the past 3+ month's i've had the pleasure of using window's 2000  .
what i'll say is it has surpassed ny expectation's in that , i thought os's were always buggy you'd always encounter the odd or maybe obligatory error  .
not with this os  .
i've had nothing but plain sailing all the way  .
seriously , i've used '98 for year's is never pleased with the (legendary) blue    screen    of    death  .
on encountering me , i found the same operating system as '98 , just with bell's whistle's now a disturbing sluggish feel to it  .
so in conclusion , 2000 is the best out there ( do not even get me started on the un    reliable bell whistle ridden mess that is xp) if you're looking for a stable , reliable , hassle free os windows 2000 is your only choice  .
i have fewer headaches and glitches with win 2000 than win xp  .
2000 is stable fast and thankfully lacks xp's neauseating cartoon interface my pc had xp preloaded and i went back to win 2000  .
i've been using windows 2000 on my home machine for three months now  .
my only regret is that i did not install it sooner  .
when i bought my machine , it came with windows me , and i had nothing but trouble with it  .
i'm still amazed that microsoft released two different operating systems that present the same interface to the user , but are like night and day when it comes to stability and reliability  .
after the switch to windows 2000 , i is able to use all the software i had already bought (except for one dos game) and it all runs better than it ever did under windows me  .
for example , under windows me , easycd creator would always underrun its buffer if i tried to burn at speeds faster than 300 kb per second  .
with windows 2000 , i can burn cds at the limit of my hardware and the buffer never drops below 98%  .
one thing i did have to do though , is add memory  .
win2k (and xp as well) is a memory hog  .
i would recommend at least 256 mb of ram  .
i upgraded to 512 mb to better accommodate high    end games like no one lives forever 2  .
my dad recently bought a new computer with win xp home edition  .
it's supposed to be an improvement over win2k , but the only significant difference i saw is nag messages for microsoft services like passport  .
i thought that once you paid for the software , it is supposed to  stop  nagging you  .
this version is stable and it is the probably the best , if you really need it  .
nobody mentions how to uninstall it but then it is not something you even consider when buying into something but look hard before you buy into this as it is a nightmare to uninstall especially if you have an oem version  .
i own it , do not go near it as i had my debut with this one  .
stable like a rock and anchors into your hardrive like an arc weld  .
microsoft offers support to oem owners on a pay per need basis right from day one  .
yes you pay to buy it , you pay to get support and they want you to pay to help you uninstall it  .
windows 2000 is basically windows xp with some little features  .
its rock solid and performs well .
i've been using win2k for over 2 years now and in that time i've had but one (1) blue screen of death  .
my pc is left on 99% of the time and the only time i reboot is during an occasional software install  .
i have been able to run 20 memory intensive applications at once and have never had a problem  .
i have to hand it to ol' bill on this one    ms really got it right .
best choice if you do not want to have ms approve every install on your personal system .
if you need stability , speed and system securuty , then windows 2000 pro is the solution  .
i first got win2k pro as a replacement for windows 98se  .
it made a world of a difference  .
uptime is a lot longer , and you need not worry about all those memory leaks that forced a reboot daily in 98se  .
with that said if you do plan to upgrade to windows 2000 get the drivers for your hardware ahead of time  .
most importantly your network/modem cards and your video card should be downloaded before hand if you don't already have it  .
you can always get the rest of them later if you have to  .
if you do plan to move on to windows xp pro , then disregard what david dickerson had to say about upgrade issues  .
no offense but he got it wrong  .
first , with win2k pro and nt4 you cannot upgrade with win xp home because microsoft wo not let you  .
its all marketing  .
but you can with 98 , 98se , me  .
second , you can use the windows xp pro upgrade package to do a clean install of windows xp pro on your machine  .
even if you take windows 2000 off your drive you can still do it  .
but the xp pro setup will ask for a windows disk that is eligible for the upgrade during the installation  .
in your case just put in the windows 2k disk  .
it will check it , go ok , and ask you to reinsert the windows xp pro setup disk and finish the setup  .
to recap , windows xp upgrade packages can do clean installs .
it's slow when you boot up , but it's stable and has a good quality and easy to install  .
you should have at lease 512mb of memory to make it boot faster  .
you should download service pack 2  .
i like it .
i have used all versions of windows , including xp professional , but win 2000 is the best among ms os  .
stable and it works without crashes  .
of course , i'm obliged to apply all the sp and patches , but nothing is perfect under microsoft if you are a professional user , i suggest not to upgrade to xp professional  .
if you are a network administrator using win 2000 server / win 2000 pro , do not consider at all to apply xp on the client side   you will waste too time .
works almost perfectly , compatible with anything outside of dos games  .
win9x/me is a cheap joke , nt4 is old and somewhat limited , xp is overweight  .
2000 is the ideal windows version  .
win9x users should not be afraid , 2000 is not really that complicated  .
reviewers are way off the mark in that area  .
you can even set it to automatically use a single user account if you're really afraid of that stuff .
upgrade from 98se in a small home network win98 se crashed too often on its nat setting win2k works so well that it has not crashed when i tried to overload the win2k server very stable but xp just a headache as much time is spent to fix the hardware and soft ware i have to open the case to put a new hard drive and forget it .
i have used all os , s since win95 including mac o (s , win 2000 pro is by far the most reliable and easiest to use  .
for the office it is a must  .
if you use your pc at home for wrigting cookbooks and surfing the net it will also do the job  .
on my work pc i installed win xp pro , but have gone back win 2000 pro its lighter and seams faster for my type of work (xp pro is very stable however)  .
i installed 2000 on my very old pentium 233 with mmx and 160meg ram and have doubled its performance , she now has a new lease of life  .
2nd to none op sys  .
recomend it for designers who don`t use mac .
i exprienced lot of crashes when i is using win me , after upgrading my computer to win2k , blue screen of death is dead  .
it's a very stable os       blows aways 9x       those were crash city       and plenty of blue screens and freeze    ups  .
the support could be better       just try calling ms for support       expect to pay for the long distance call unless you live in the seattle/redmond wa area  .
i've been running it for nealy a month now at work , i must admit i only installed it as i is getting explorer gpf's in nt  .
it has not crashed once and once you get used to having the admin tools hidden in the control panel you thin your'e running nt .
win 2k is by far the most stable os released by ms  .
though i had some problems getting my dvd up and running , there have been a lot less bsods after the upgrade touch wood  .
if you're searching for an operating system that let you work without problems    windows 2000 pro is for you  .
but if you use your computer for multimedia , such as mp3 and online videos , for e    mails or for gaming , you should think about upgrading to windows xp home edition or windows 98 se , but do not upgrade to windows me  .
windows 2000 pro has some problems with peripherals and compatibility , but it offers great performances and a lot of stability  .
if you're thinking about upgrading your pc to windows 2000 pro , you should also consider windows xp pro , that is the new version of windows 2000 .
if you have tried multiple os use 2k pro its the most stable and the best i used xp for two weeks and felt better when i switched back  .
it is one year that i'm using win2k (sp2 by now) no crushes  .
but one thing is bad it not handles all games i do not know anything about xp hope it is gonna be better afer about year from now .
i have been running winbloze machines since win 95 and this os rocks  .
with xp based on the same kernel all the new applications and games support it  .
and you can finally get rid of dos  .
having few problems even with unsupported chipset  .
though some software does not work such as the adaptec direct cd that worked with nt4 .
used by 15 people , needs rebooting about once a month  .
sometimes minor problems with networking .
i recently installed a second hand copy of windows 2000 on my system , as a dual boot with windows me  .
it is recommended that windows 2000 be installed on its own partition , so i used the freeware fips to non distructively create another partition  .
the installation went flawlessly  .
windows 2000 would not recognize my old intel combination modem/cam card , which is understandable since intel doesn't even support the product any more  .
all of the other hardware , including an inexpensive scanner , were compatible  .
the system is very stable , and at bootup i choose which windows i want  .
i use me for the multimedia stuff , games , and for the kids use  .
windows 2000 is for the serious work , using office , etc , when stability is critical  .
at this point given what i have read i would not even consider xp  .
one caveat   when installing as a dual boot system , make up your mind beforehand that you want to finish , as an aborted install can make the hard drive unbootable .
windows 2000 is definitely the windows 98 alternative  .
although it is not meant for gaming , the stability is incredible  .
the features are amazing  .
the support could use a little work , but everything else is great  .
device drivers are still hard to find in some cases but most can be found  .
i like it .
i upgraded from windows nt 4 (sp 6) to windows 2000 professional very soon after windows 2000 professional is released  .
despite the usual patches from microsoft , plus two service packs , i am very glad that i upgraded to win2k pro  .
(i also ended up updating some major hardware , but the investment is a good one  .
) microsoft's support of the product get a mixed review from me  .
most of the time when i had a problem , microsoft insisted that my hardware is incompatible , although i had win2k drivers from all of the hardware manufacturers  .
at one point , microsoft support insisted that i flash the bios of my motherboard using the lastest version , which is a beta  .
the representative said he would not assist me until i used the beta flash ; i did , and my motherboard died  .
i also had one representative , joe , who is so rude that i got him in trouble with his superiors  .
he always behaved in this manner and i received two written apologies from microsoft , but       much to my disappointment       i ended up getting two more cases assigned to him  .
such behavior is inexcusable and microsoft should terminate any support representative who is rude and insulting  .
i find xp pro very tempting , but every time i think that i will take the plunge , i remember how stable 2000 pro is and the teething pains i had with it (not to mention the support trauma )       and i do not place an order for xp pro  .
finally , if you are running windows 2000 pro , have decided to upgrade to xp pro , and you want to do a clean install , forget about buying the upgrade version of xp pro  .
you must purchase the full version of xp pro in order to do a clean installation , although you are eligible for the upgrade version  .
(i assume that this situation is the result of microsoft's antipiracy measures , but i always do clean installs of new operating systems  .
) i am still considering xp professional , but windows 2000 professional is a keeper , and i see no harm in rushing into a decision , particularly after reading many reviews of xp pro .
iv been working with win2k small buisness server and advanced server  .
there the best os's since nt 4  .
0 server  .
forget xp you'll spend the next 2 months downloading the proper drivers to work with your operating system .
nt workstataion had been microsofts best user product but it appear win2000 pro tops it  .
can be hard to find drivers but the stability is well worth the search  .
stay away from xp i've tried it it's mixing winme with 2000 a combination that does not work well winme is horrible so why stick with a bad idea  .
i used it on a p4 1  .
6 gig and it ran like win95 on a 486 thanks microsoft but nothanks .
win2k is overall very good  .
quality gets a 4 only because microsoft has yet to fix problems with their 'active desktop' and i doubt they will be fixed in xp   microsoft prefers adding in new features rather than fixing old features which still have wrinkles to be ironed out  .
features meaning how well win2k being the amalgamation of nt stability + win98 multimedia capability  .
stability is top    notch  .
for an os which uses ~750 mb of disk space , win2k is great  .
mac os x (ox) takes a mammoth 1  .
5 gb disk space , and win xp has a ludicrous 2 gb requirement       so obviously i'm not switching to either platform  .
win2k is quite ideal  .
support    look at microsoft's wealth and the salaries of the ceos  .
combine that with how not all bugs get fixed (and yet how new os releases seem to fix more problems than service packs) , and it is clear microsoft should not be asking tons of money for support calls  .
they are a monopoly ; they find new ways to get consumers to upgrade  .
they could be respectable and civil enough to give out free support  .
(just wait until ms starts laying off their workers ) if microsoft does not fix existing problems (and reduce the size of its os , of which the reasons are technical and many as to why size does matter in an operating system)  .
microsoft needs to fix its product now or else xp's replacement 1~2 years from now will not even sell  .
even the most non    technical person cannot consistently be fooled  .
i have been using this operating system for the past 8 months now  .
i have never been as pleased with an os as i am with this one  .
stability is one of a kind  .
the only minor problem that it has is that there are some hardware/software out there that will not run on it  .
other than that , if you can afford to buy it , it is a must buy  .
this is a great o/s and very comparable to windows xp even though there is no themes or anything like xp  .
there are the transition effects though  .
anyways you can run most windows xp programs on it since it's built off of the ntfs  .
very stable , if one program crashes then the whole o/s is not sucked in with it , a very good task manager is built in  .
recommended for those who want something new and do not care much for their older software and games that ran on 98 , though some programs still run  .
great os  .
or else go back to windows me for what its worth  .
windows 2000 pro is nothing but a slow pig with very frustrating boot times (make a pot of coffee)and requires a password  .
even with the latest sp3 , its still slower than xp or me  .
it even refused to accept my modem  .
and after 3 trys and strikes , 2000 is out  .
xp is garbage  .
please do not buy it people  .
this is simply the best m$ os on the market .
i have never had to deal with so many application crashes before  .
i think i would rather save my time and money and reinstall win98 before i do that again .
i have been with ms since dos 3    win 3  .
0 and have been a fan ever since  .
i've had two blue screens in the last 3    4 months  .
i never turn my pc off  .
i wish there were no blue screens but i wish i owned a island too  .
my next os will be linux though xp is the end of the road .
if you are running only microsoft made programs and no games , then it will run fine , great  .
but i use more than just stuff made by microsoft , every game i have crashes , and it crashes without games running  .
lots of nice features , but even if i is running a business i would not use this .
i just do not see the point of this upgrade  .
runs much slower than nt , eats up memory , cannot see the advantage of using it .
for no reason , you will see a program , which is named system8 , continuing writing to your hard drive and it will last as long as your computer is on  .
this stupid thing happened every single time after 2 hours of using the computer  .
i know this because i saw the hard drive led is flashing for hours  .
i then used a program call filemon , and it showed that system8 is writing something to the disk drive  .
there are other system programs which do the same thing , but i guess that's enough .
there seems to be problems with the way win2k handles video on my older machines using 32 meg pci video cards  .
i get regular crashes on different games in virtually the same way for both systems  .
if only on one i'd expect the card , but the video cards are different  .
the only consistency i get is consistent crashes .
poor implementation of netware's nds  .
the install process is still primitive and virtually unchanged from nt  .
while it's an improvement over nt , anyone with experience with other oss will be disappointed at the least .
windows 2000 the late great model of things to come  .
i surely hope not  .
98 was , at least , commercially viable  .
the only reason microsoft continues to exist is the computer user base  .
about 95% just do not know any better  .
windows is great if you arent burdened with worrying about your systems integrity  .
about access from without and within  .
the instabiltiy of the platform as a whole  .
so just close your eyes , breathe deeply and enjoy your computing experience  .
ignorance is bliss .
standards for desktop os today are are set by ms  .
we all know how 'high' these standards are  .
well 2000 has not crashed on me yet  .
so thats pretty good .
it is not stable , because the registry and dll hell  .
this combination is enough to make it very unreliable .
i had problems from the begining , it just never worked it is bloatware and good for nothing i went back to good old reliable windows 95  .
have 2 machines at home one has win2k and the other has win98se  .
win2k has continued to perform well and remain stable through a couple win98se installs on the other machine  .
win2k does boot slower , but since it seldom crashes , i seldom have to reboot so not a big deal .
