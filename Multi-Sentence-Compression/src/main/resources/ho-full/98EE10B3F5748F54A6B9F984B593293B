upon arrival , we had a seamless checkin , everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful .
the lobby , pool and room were very modern and just the right atmosphere ( albeit it 's in disney ) meaning not chaotic or overcrowded at all and the room itself was very well appointed and nice with heavy doors that block out noise !
the pools were great with one of them being meant more for the little children who could hang out in the graded shallow end in water or play in a foot deep pool with no nervousness .
the water did n't smell over chlorinated as it did at another disney hotel that was inundated with families and kids .
we ordered food at the pool and was told we had to hurry and eat it bc the birds would attack it .
one of the dishes ( do n't order the yummy sounding nachos ) was terrible .
we told them and they did nothing .
as service oriented as they 'd been this was disappointing and then they charged us for it w/ no resolution .
the bathroom was probably one of two things i was disappointed in the most - shower head was 10 ft high and the water sprayed everywhere bc it was so wide and the magnifying mirror ( which was a surprise ) had not been cleaned and had other 's lashes and brows on it .
the second thing was of all the details they did n't put it room blackening shades like everyone else . . .

it looks like it but there are two boxed areas where light comes in . . .
why ? ! ? !
we 'd still come back but would be aware of the minor issues.
