$$;
Pros:. As if the feature set for the Droid wasn't awesome enough, I just realized today I could Wordpress via my Droid. How freakin cool is that?! Check it out here: http://www.leospetcare.com/blog-1053. 
Cons:. Honestly, my only concern has been battery life. So now I've got chargers at home, at work, in the car... and I'm happy! :D. 
Summary:. Oh, I want a Droid X.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent GUI, easy to operate. 
Cons:. touch screen can be a little buggy. 
Summary:. I love this phone although it has glitches sometimes. That happens with all smart phones though. I find it very reliable and would purchase another one in a heartbeat.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is by far the best phone I've ever owned. It's very fast and the APPS available are awesome.. 
Cons:. The keys on the keyboard are too small for my hands....so I rarely use it.. 
Summary:. It's well worth the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Adobe flash player 10.1. you can use usb tethering and hotspot via on pc only. ugh verizon. Finally can take picture with led flash in dark!. video chat on qik is awesome. 
Cons:. Battery life time at time. Hopefully android can support it with 3.0 os!. 
Summary:. Get this phone u wont regret.. 

$$;
Pros:. awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
Cons:. awesome!!!!!!!!!!. 
Summary:. awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. great call quality, verizon, snes emulator!, does every thing i need it to do, and a physical keyboard.. 
Cons:. battery is lacking but i can replace it.. 
Summary:. solid phone with an app to do any thing important. rooted my phone and installed a custom rom of froyo so now i can watch flash and what not.. 

$$;
Pros:. Freedom to do literally WHAT EVER YOU WANT! loud speakers, great service from verizon, flash 10.1, growing application store, excellent camera quality, and a huge screen to display it all!. 
Cons:. application store is behind apples as of the today, when to many apps run in background, the phone can slow up and crash from time to time, but not to frequently to be an issue.. 
Summary:. by far the best phone ive ever owned, it easily tops its competition, whether its a blackberry or the iphone, i would grab a droid, or any android phone for that matter without hesitation, ive become to accustom to open customization abilities, free tethering (via pdanet on the market) as well as the other features from the android os to go back.. 

$$;
Pros:. - the screen. - GPS navigation. - OTA update. - mounts as a usb device. - android os. - google voice. - widgets. 
Cons:. the slide-out keyboard is pretty much useless for me; the on-screen is fine.. Camera is only OK, ( however the 480p video is quite good). 
Summary:. This machine's hardware has been superseded by more recent models, but it still does just fine, and with expected performance improvements with froyo, I expect this phone will meet my needs for some time to come.. My wife has an iPhone 3gs which I recently upgraded to ios4, and was frustrated by the absolute need to go through itunes for everything; some people are OK with that but I find it restrictive; I pre-empted the last OTA update for the droid by downloading the update from google to the phone?s sdcard , then I installed it manually. Whenever my wife wants some media that I have on my phone; I hook the droid up to her laptop via usb, drag and drop, easy. Same goes for media the other way; I drag and drop music onto my droid frequently.. - GPS navigation. This phone basically retired our GPS because it has full turn-by-turn navigation; the route and the audio are downloaded from the cloud as it plans the trip; My wife noticed that it?s gotten better at pronouncing street names in the last few months; no work on my part, no upgrading firmware or buying disks from garmin.. I don?t pay for SMS because I use google voice. If I want to make an international call, I can set up my phone to automatically make that call through google voice ( = 0.02 cents per minute to Ireland ). Verizon has it set up so you can make skype calls directly from the handset over 3g.. I switched from AT&#38;T partly because their coverage was useless for me ( zero signal in my office at work; Verizon has no problem ). Also, with the new cloud messaging API introduced with Froyo, I think there is going to be a huge surge in cloud-based mobile computing that is going to be very interesting.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's a powerful phone with tones of free apps and rich features. The features seem endless. 
Cons:. The industrial design isn't the greatest. The iPhone is elegant, and this one, well, it's just a bit clunky. Motorola should wake up and add a little elegance to their products.. Also, no nice leather holster available! Magnets/sleep driving mode?. 
Summary:. Overall, I can't believe the power they have packed into this tiny device. The small sacrifice in industrial design shortcomings is well worth the signal that I'm able to get and no dropped calls..... 

$$;
Pros:. Call Quality. Hardware. Software. Fast Phone. Open platform. Easy to use. 
Cons:. No spell check with physical keyboard. No flash until July 2010. 
Summary:. I absolutely love my Driod.. I switched from a T-Mobile Wing (horrible, horrible carrier &#38; phone....shudder...), to the Droid, and it's incredible how much faster I can do things.. Great hardware and software implementation. I like the Droid quite a bit more than the iPhone (played around a while with both before purchase). Android is a much more custom experience, and I really dislike iTunes.. Updated. on Sep 3, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. large display, fast browser, great email functionality.. I love the weight of this phone, not too heavy and not too light.. 
Cons:. auto-lock feature is mildly annoying. 
Summary:. Having upgraded from a Blackberry 8830 World Edition, I must say that I am immensely impressed. The Droid has met and exceeded my expectations. This phone is a all-inclusive device that functions as a media player, GPS system, communication device, and PDA. I was considering the HTC Droid Incredible but decided on the Motorola because 1) It was in stock. Incredible on back order until July. 2) I actually like the thickness and weight of the Motorola better. As someone who tends to drop my phone alot, I felt the Motorola would stand up to more abuse. I am extremely pleased with this device and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a phone that marries cutting edge technology with good looks.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything, this phone is cool. 
Cons:. None that I can tell.. 
Summary:. I cannot keep my hands off of it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great device that is versatile and provides the functionality of high-end phone, GPS, and PDA in one. Voice capability was just added and so far it is amazing.. 
Cons:. Keyboard is just a little small compared to other phones but with a little practice all is well. Screen is difficult to keep clean, but that is a mix of using it frequently and the touch screen capabilities.. 
Summary:. If you enjoy the Google suite of products then you must have this phone. Order phone chargers and extra chargers for work as you will use it often. It has proven to be seamless working with my office Microsoft Exchange Server as well as vpn connectivity. Improvements continue and the widgets continue to grow.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is completely customizable. Everything is at your disposal. The Android Market has thousands and thousands of many and many are FREE!! There are so many things that I love about this phone, it would be hard to name them all.. 
Cons:. I can't think of any.. 
Summary:. Bottom line... get the Droid! It's better than the iPhone in my opinion!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Internet access practically anywhere. This is THE phone for people who really don't want a cell phone. I've heard a lot of compaints about battery life, but it beats a laptop hands down. The charger that comes with the droid is also a USB cable.. 
Cons:. It's addictive. The biggest problem I have thus far is that the touch screen is too sensitive while talking on the phone. Again, if the only thing you want is a device to make and receive calls, save your money and buy a basic cellphone.. 
Summary:. Let's be honest, I don't want a cell phone. As a Mom, I need one. For my job, I have to have one. In reality, I'd rather not have a landline, much less a portable device enabling people to call me wherever I roam.. That said, I love the internet. I like to take pictures, listen to music, surf the web, play games, read books, and occasionally text my friends and family to touch base. As a frequent traveler, it's nice to have a map that doesn't have to be folded, unfolded, or studied on the side of the road with little gas and practically no light at 0300 if lost. I now have all of this and more with one device... no need to have a tomtom, phone, ipod, camera, and laptop to lug around. Oh, and if I'm inclined to do so, I can call people :). The Droid is the first smartphone I've had. My first qwerty keyboard. First touchscreen. I have not been disappointed.. The android market is full of free apps. Many are actually worth having and do what you need them to do. If you want a Droid, here are a few tips.. As soon as you activate your droid, find an antivirus app. For now, there doesn't seem to be many accounts of phone viruses but that is sure to change. I use Lookout because it also has an option to remotely wipe the droid and/or make it scream should someone decide to steal it.. Afterwards, have fun. Be careful though. Check out what the app you are installing will have access to on your droid. For example, I wanted an app to help organize a grocery list. I found a really cool one but it had access to my phone settings, GPS, phone calls, SD card.... it was crazy. I decided pen and paper works just fine.. Also keep in mind that the info an app has access to may change. Point in case, I had a lightsaber app to amuse the hubby. I reviewed the access the day after I installed it, and was disappointed to see that the app had access to practically everything but my DNA profile. I uninstalled, much to my hubby's dismay. To pacify him, I searched the app again. Per market, it only listed 'prevent phone from sleeping' as an access. I reinstalled, cheked the access, which still listed only 'prevent phone from sleeping'. I rechecked it again a few hours later, and was not suprised to note that the app suddenly had access to everything but my DNA once again. I uninstalled it for good. So monitor your apps!. Keep in mind that all cell phones can be used to track you. That's great if you're a missing person and it sucks if you have a psycho stalker. I don't, but I'm still a little paranoid about how easy it can be to be tracked by your cellphone. If you are of a similiar opinion, adjust the settings on your droid. Be sure to disable the "My location" setting, among other things. This means that when you open Google you won't get a cool list of locations of questionable interest near your personal point in space, but that's ok. You can always turn it on temporarily if you feel the need to do so.. Some apps are cool, come from a fairly reliable source, and have access to things I'd rather not they have access to. Google Sky is one. If you're totally paranoid and don't want anyone to have access to you, your not going to like the droid. Then again, you probably don't want a droid in the first place. However, I can understand why google sky needs to know my GPS location- I don't understand why a grocery list app needs it.. In the month that I've had my droid, I've used it daily. I have used it to navigate to a family reunion and bypass the tollbooth, thank you very much. I've taken really good pics of a varity of things, no more "I wish I had my camera." I have found out just what that bright dot in the sky is- it was venus, I didn't remember venus being quite so high from high school science class. I used a translator to help someone whose english was not great. I used a compass app because it was cool. I took my kids geocaching one day when they were bored and driving me nuts. I've read five books, on my phone. I have an alarm clock that works. I have a flashlight that I never forget to bring with me. I kept myself entertained when asked to 'pull ahead' in the drivethrough. I aways know the date of the next full moon and is it waxing or waning. I have a unit converter for work. I've looked up an endless number of useful things to know, right when I needed to know. I got online while in an extremely remote location where my friend didn't even have phone service because I could. I showed a fellow gardener the really pretty flower I planted, a rare plant with an impossible name. I've even made a few phone calls, and was pleased with the reception and sound quality. None of this has cost me one extra penny beyond the monthly cell bill.. If you want a phone, get one. If you think way too much, love to research and do cool geeky things, get a Droid! If you find yourself far from home, wishing you had remembered to bring a book, your camera, laptop, etc... get a Droid!. 

$$;
Pros:. All the things this phone does WOW. 
Cons:. Can't wait for flash play. 
Summary:. I have had every cell phone that has came out(iphone-blackberry storm you name it) an hands down I have never been more happier with a phone. All I can say to sum this up is BRAVO MOTOROLA YOU HAVE STEP UP YOUR GAME. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the ability to run multiple applications at a time. I can listen to Pandora radio while updating my Facebook page. It's pretty fast in completing tasks.. 
Cons:. I don't like that battery life, especially if I'm on it a lot. Also, sometimes it freezes. This is my first smart phone so I don't know if that is normal or not.. 

$$;
Pros:. Customization. Connectivity. Syncs with my Mac/iTunes. Even plays ACC audio files. Play movies, music, sync email; google, mac mail, iCal through Google. Surf the WEB!!! Connect to Wi-Fi or 3G network. Games are good and getting better.. 
Cons:. There are not as many games as on iPhone. You can't initiate voice dialing through bluetooth, you have to use the phone and hit 2 buttons instead of just one. The bluetooth device can dial the last number you called and answer calls though.. 
Summary:. I was considering leaving Verizon so that I could get an iPhone on AT&#38;T and I am so GLAD that I decided to take a look at the Droid. I mean, I don't see what it is lacking at all compared to an iPhone. Maybe just a smaller pool of games to choose from. If you think that the Droid has low quality games, just buy the Raging Thunder 2 game. It's just like playing a PS2 game. This is a great example of the capabilities of this phone as a game player. I just LOVE this phone. I have 15 movies loaded on it and about 4 GB of music. If I decide to upgrade to the 32 GB SD Micro I can have double! There is no reason that I can see to deter a smart phone buyer from getting this phone. The Bluetooth problem is not a big deal to me, because when I'm driving the phone is always in the GPS style cradle and it's no problem to hit my voice dial button and then hit the phone again when it lists the contact I voice-searched for. It's not a big enough problem for me especially when there is a perfectly good and easy work-around.. Updated. on Apr 19, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. everything. 
Cons:. there is none. 
Summary:. i got this phone a week ago and it has been the greatest phone ever i havent used my computer since i dont need to this thing is a computer the call quality is amazing crisp clear neverending apps battery life is excellent if u download the app killer app the keyborad on the phone is wonderful the camera is perfect i could go on and on but final saying best phone ever (the phone i had before was a delve so thats a big step up). 

$$;
Pros:. Has pretty much everything you need in a mobile device.. 
Cons:. Lacks GSM mode.. 

$$;
Pros:. Phone does just about anything that you would need a phone to do.. 
Cons:. Slide out keyboard is under par.. 
Summary:. Phone is great! This is the first phone that i haven't gotten bored with. The app store continues to grow which makes the phone operate a little differently each time. So far my phone has operated flawlessly. Highly recommend!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast and responsive. I love the open source and most of the apps that I had to buy for my iPhone are free for the Droid. This is the best phone I have ever owned and I have owned a lot.. 
Cons:. Don't care much for the physical keyboard but I use the virtual keyboard anyway.. 
Summary:. If you want quick response time from apps as well as your browser, this is the phone for you. Tons of useful apps are free and the screen size and resolution are unmatched.. 

$$;
Pros:. Powerfull, beautifull, smooth,lots. 
Cons:. hmmmm nothing big.. 
Summary:. great apps great look great feel good price ...no complaints. Ive had almost all smartphones in the last 2-3 years and this is my favorite. gotta love the google os.. 

$$;
Pros:. - almost everything is customizable. - beautiful screen. - handy to have the physical keyboard. - multitasking. - fast processor. - nice camera. 
Cons:. If you've been using an iPhone it takes a little getting used to the menu design. While not as intuitive, it is a better design in the end. What doesn't take any getting used to is its ability to multitask, faster processor, and better photos.. 
Summary:. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is getting tired of the iPhone hype or just wants a solid smartphone on great network like Verizon. It'll do anything an iPhone does and probably better. I spent months agonizing over this purchase, and I'm glad I made the right choice and went with the Droid.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Blazingly Fast Processor. -Fast, reliable Verizon Network. -In-depth. -Gorgeous, large screen. -Keyboard + Touchscreen. -Google Market (Apps). -Customizable. -Multi-tasking. 
Cons:. -Not a phone for simple, dump, or impatient people. -Takes a few days to get the hang of it. 
Summary:. Some background on me: Been a Mac user since 2007, have had Verizon since 2003, have the iPod Touch, has friends with the iPhone (same as the touch, without the phone) and BlackBerries. First off, I want to say that I think Mac makes some great products in regard to innovation and design. I have the most recent software on my iPod Touch (same thing as the iPhone, without the phone or crappy AT&#38;T) , have a ton of apps on there, and use it all the time. I think Apple started it all when it came to innovation and improving the SmartPhone, but the Motorola Droid has definitely taken it to the next level. The positive reviews you are reading are not just from people who are anti-Apple Fanboys, but people who have owned Apple products including the iPhone. You definitely should listen to them if they say they had an iPhone but the Motorola Droid blows it away.. I first went into the Verizon store and played with this for about 30 minutes. I walked out, not sure if I really liked it especially since the keyboard felt awkward at first. I was actually going to wait a bit and get the HTC incredible when it came out on Verizon. I did more research and found that a lot of people mentioned that the keyboard takes getting used to, but that it is worth getting because it's a handy thing to have. As someone who's been using the Touch for 3 years and had an LG Dare before getting this phone, the novelty of a pure touch screen isn't as appealing to me as anymore and it's luster has worn off. There's times when I wish I had a keyboard which provides easier typing and just more accuracy in regard to selection. I was surprised that Motorola actually came out with a great product!. I came back the day after and played with it for an hour in the store. As I played with it more, I began to get the hang of the keyboard and found it extremely useful. In addition, I had a Verizon rep who had the Droid who really showed me all the neat features of the phone and knew the ins and outs of it. I actually told him ?Look, it takes a lot to WOW me. I have an iPod Touch and I?m familiar with all the Apps and what it can do. Show me something impressive about this phone.? There?s too many things to name as to what he showed me, but let me just say that this is not a phone for simple people. I bought the phone, and have no regrets that I did. It is honestly the best phone I've ever had and I can honestly say this puts the iPhone to shame.. It will take you about a few days to learn how to navigate the phone, but once you learn what it?s capable of doing, it?s just even more exciting! I?m used to the iTunes apps and was a bit skeptical about the Android Market, but I did find many apps that were free or low-priced ($1.99) that were close or equal to what I had on my iPod Touch which were mostly budget/finance apps, games, etc. The Google Market actually has a lot more cooler apps when it comes to customizing your phone, so I actually think it?s better than what iTunes has to offer.. I?ve pitted my Droid against my friends? iPhones, Blackberry on AT&#38;T, and Blackberry on Sprint and it doesn?t even compare when it comes to the processing speed of the Droid against their phones. Even the Droid vs. the HTC Eris (both on Verizon), you?ll notice a difference. This is THE phone to get on Verizon, and anyone with an iPhone who says the Droid sucks is obviously someone who hasn?t spent 24 hours with this phone. My friends with iPhones were actually envious of my phone, though some didn?t want to outright admit it.. Updated. on Apr 5, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent camera, excellent display, nice touch screen, everything about the phone is nice except one thing. 
Cons:. The battery isn't the best but does its what it can since the phone has a lot of features.. 
Summary:. The Droid is by far the best smart phone Verizon has to offer. Everything is nice about the phone except the battery. The battery life is very short but with all the features, you can't really expect it to last real long. Besides that, I think it is very nice and is much better than my old Samsung SCH-i760. This phone will be around for a long long tine.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the slide out QWERTY keyboard. I have heard people complain that the keys are too flat, but you really get used to it after a couple of texts..at least I did.. 
Cons:. I really don't have any cons other than currently there is no pinch zoom in the default browser..but that is coming soon..and the cameras shutter is kinda slow so you have to make sure you hold still while taking pics.. 
Summary:. This is a great phone and you can drag and drop your itunes songs directly onto the SD card and they will play..so..you basically can put all your itunes on here. =). 

$$;
Pros:. Everthing sound camera email apps and build quality.. 
Cons:. none so far and dont forsee any. 
Summary:. This is my first smartphone and I am glad I waited Motorola is back. 

$$;
Pros:. A solid Android phone that is amazingly thin considering it has a keyboard. Lots of Apps that will only keep growing.. 
Cons:. Small internal memory, keyboard is a bit hard to type on, battery life is average. Android has a few quirks.. 
Summary:. The best phone out there. The iPhone runs it close but the Droid's keyboard, although not the best, pushes it into the lead.. 

$$;
Pros:. Here is a list of pros:. The GPS. Android Market. Customizable display. onscreen keyboards (especially the landscape keyboard). 
Cons:. Cons:. Slide out keyboard (not that it is any bad, but it feels very awkward). Battery life (though you can adjust the brightness of the screen to make it last longer). Size (a bit large). 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, very stylish, love all the apps. 
Cons:. battery life could be a little better. 

$$;
Pros:. everything, great apps, customize everything, battery life is good as long as you dont run things all the time such as wifi and gps. absolutely no complaints.. 
Cons:. i dont use the slide out keyboard much cause i got fat fingers and they are not textured so really hard to feel what you are pressing.. 
Summary:. sweeeeeeet a** phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, internet, touch screen, apps.. 
Cons:. Battery life.. 
Summary:. This phone does everything. The screen is fabulous and the internet is truly fast. Like the option of physical keyboard. Downloaded the beta swype keyboard and now rarely use the physical keyboard. Los of apps to choose from to personalize your phone right down to the color the led light flashes when you get a text depending on who sent it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android provides an amazing interface that is easy to use and *********.. 
Cons:. The buttons on the keyboard sometimes stick.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super fast browsing, &#38; fast navigation speed. Fast searches. Great speakerphone. Great voice searches, &#38; voice dialing. Very user friendly. GREAT PHONE !!. 
Cons:. My only complaint is that there is no easy way to sync the phone with Outlook for contact updates. You can export your contacts in a CSV file and upload it to your gmail account, and it will send the contacts to the phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Multi-tasking is a noteworthy feature packed into the Verizon Droid. 5mp camera, fast processors and expandable memory, High resolution Screen, I like the keyboard and it incorporates the best that happened to the internet since the Internet. Google.. 
Cons:. Verizon made it cheap 2warm people up 2 a phone that can actually measure up 2 the best Phone they've evr seen not another failed attempt 2copy the Iphone. Its cheap n it shows from a mile away. Apple is a tough competitor Its favored by certain ppl.. 
Summary:. Get this phone. its worth your money. Verizon has the best services for your TV Computer or Cellphone all the more reasons to go with the Droid.. 

$$;
Pros:. -KEYBOARD. -VERY LOUD SPEAKER. -Free GPS from Google Nav. -Lightning fast 3G. -Battery lasts 2 days with heavy use, better than my old iPhone 3GS.. - Full functionality as iPhone. -Customizable widgets! iPhone 3GS cant do that!!. -Snappy interface. 
Cons:. -Have to use Verizon car charger and not a knockoff mini USB car charger. -none other than car charger issue.. 
Summary:. I switched from AT&#38;T on their iPhone 3GS and was tired of unreliable 3G signal. I was dropping calls everywhere! In my area we have excellent Verizon service. Everyone on my street has Verizon and no one has had any issues with service, while some other people that have AT&#38;T on my street have spotty service.. The iPhone doesn't have widgets. The iPhone doesn't have customizable backgrounds for the apps to sit on. The iPhone doesn't have a keyboard.. I am someone who needs a physical keyboard because the staleness has set in for the iPhone. Apple fails to update and refresh how the device runs and gives the average consumer the choice to customize.. Droid does. Period. Droid does everything I ask it to. The Droid also MULTITASKS! It may eat a little battery but it does last longer than the iPhone 3GS. Let me tell you, I did the same internet surfing and e-mail on the iPhone and the Droid and I would leave the house at 6 am and come home at 5 with a dead iphone. With the droid i would leave the house at 6 am and come home at 5 with 1/3 battery gone. I still have most of my battery left for the rest of the day! Droid's battery is excellent! I have no issues at all!. Droid's camera is 5.0 Mega Pixels while iPhone is 3.0 Mega Pixels. The Droid takes fantastic pictures and when the iPhone cant see in the dark to take pictures, the Droid comes in and uses its duel LED flash to light up your photo.. This phone, DROID, does an execllent job at picking up the slack that the iPhone does. I can multitask and do everything plus more with Droid on a better network.. I have not dropped any calls on Verizon since the Droid came out and am very happy with the service. Verizon has 3G coverage everywhere I am in New England. New York City is so much better for Droid because AT&#38;T's spotty service in NYC doesn't do me any good. Thanks to Droid, its been a life saver. Enough said. Droid wins.. One last thing. iPhones GPS doesn't work in nyc when the droids does. Droid does an excellent job and keeps up with the new technology of GPS. It didn't say lost connection or anything when traveling from 5th ave to Broadway. Thanks again and the clear winner here is the Droid.. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredible GPS/map capability. 5m camera. Tethering. Open architecture.. 
Cons:. No hands free voice dialing. A real miss. 

$$;
Pros:. More than just a phone, a mini-computer! My first smart phone, and I didn't realize what I was missing.. Google Maps works great. Lots of apps, some that are actually usable.. Great battery life on standby (using task killer).. 
Cons:. Some websites aren't viewable, esp those with Adobe Flash.. After leaving plugged in over night, seems to stop charging and goes back into an 'unplugged' mode. So, keeping it plugged in will not ensure it is always charged.. 
Summary:. Great phone, will probably buy another for my wife.. 

$$;
Pros:. this phone is purely amazing. i used to have an iPhone that broke at least 7 times but my droid hasn't broken since i bought it on the first day that it came out.. 
Cons:. some of the better iphone apps havent YET been made for android. 
Summary:. recommend it to anyone under the age off 40 and above the age of 12. 

$$;
Pros:. Dual Processors, Blazing fast internet, Multitasking with thousands of Applications, Totally Customizable phone, Google Maps with Free GPS, I love it so much!. 
Cons:. Battery life is shorter than usual due to dual processors. The operating manual is a joke, only cover basics and leaves you to learn everything else. Data Package to use this cell is additional $30 to your calling plan ouch!. 
Summary:. Solid performance with total customization. I keep finding new applications to use and keep being blown away with all the features.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Screen. Good Verizon Service. Connection to Google. Navigation Feature. 
Cons:. Apps not as varied as iPhone. Apps can be more expensive. Battery life could be better. 
Summary:. I've been using an iPhone 3Gs provided by my employer for almost a year now and like it quite a bit. We got my spouse a Droid over Christmas and she has been using it now for a couple of months. She is extremely happy with it, the free Navigation tool, while perhaps not as good as a dedicated device, has come in very handy for her on multiple occasions. The link to her Google account means no having to transfer contact information. The Verizon service is simply better than AT&#38;T in our location. The apps she has she really enjoys. If I had my way I would ditch the iPhone in favor of the Droid myself. The only thing I would miss is the pinch to zoom but the spouse doesn't even notice that because she never had an iPhone, it doesn't bother her at all.. Overall VERY pleased with this smartphone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Customization, open interface, widgets, google syncronization w/ google apps, etc, etc.... 
Cons:. Keypad takes time to get used to. Slow camera.. 
Summary:. I enjoy this the droid more than any other phone I have owned, including the iphone. That's because I am not constricted to how I can use this phone in terms of customizing the home screen and how I can store music/videos to my memory card. The touch screen is very responsive and the keypad is more useful than I imagined. I use it when i'm just not in the mood to use a touch screen. Most importantly, I use google apps for my business and I don't miss a beat in terms of synchronization and access.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Has some qwerks and won't support Flash Player, which is a must. They say they're going to fix that but they haven't yet. 
Summary:. It's a great phone I'm enjoying it and really haven't had any problems. 

$$;
Pros:. fast, full qwerty keyboard, great voice recognition, great camera, smooth sturdy design.. 
Cons:. facebook for android sucks,. 
Summary:. great phone that can hold its own with any smartphone out there!. 

$$;
Pros:. True multitasking, great external and internal sound, better network, nice size, fantastic screen, voice recognition for search is phenomenal.. 
Cons:. Need a separate app to monitor background processes (can get it for free), flat physical keyboard (which I rarely use, anyway). 
Summary:. Maybe I had low expectations, but this phone exceeded my expectations in so many ways. I now have a phone that can play Pandora Radio while I'm surfing the net, and my calls don't get dropped anymore. Love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. * sound quality. * extensive use of GPS technology w/ integration with Google maps. * real keyboard. * touch screen. * removable memory. * quality build. * uncensored apps. * innovative magnetic control of software. * 5 MB camera w/flash &#38; video. 
Cons:. * I use it so much that I need to have 2 batteries on hand. 
Summary:. This is really a mini-laptop computer, and then some. The sheer usefulness of the GPS integration is one thing that really surprised me. You can just speak into it and find the nearest store, or library, or police station, or anything. You can speak into it and have it call any contact. Since the oS is open-source, and Android devices are popping up all over the place, the app selection will start to expand exponentially. The brilliant hardware design will assure a long and very useful life for the Droid.. 

$$;
Pros:. If your stuff is based in google, it's an effortless existence. Everything is shared and syncronized automatically. The apps (of which I've only tried a handful) make everything else sooooo smooth.. 
Cons:. Some might think it's a little heavy, but I like the weight of the item because it "feels" like "quality".. 

$$;
Pros:. - Multitasking. - Fast internet. - call quality. - easy navigation. - customizable. - camera quality. - google search and maps/navigation, accurate. 
Cons:. - can't call and surf at the same time. (but can receive calls while surfing). 
Summary:. My headline says it all. If there is it's not available yet. This phone is fast and easy to use. The internet is super quick, which is important to an inpatient person to me. The email use is great, I have all my email accounts in one view, and get notified when I receive new email. It's the fastest way to check my email. I think the screen is amazing, pictures look great. My decision was between droid and iphone, and I don't regret my decision. I have had this phone since thanksgiving and haven't had any problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen, fast, great web browsing, so much to cutomize, new apps daily. 
Cons:. It slowed down when I installed an anti-virus.... I deleted this and it is back up to speed. I was informed that the anti-virus was not necessary through several sources.. 
Summary:. People judge too quickly. This phone is great and I have no complaints so far.. Updated. on Jan 23, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. metal case, big screen,slide out keyboard,speedy,all the apps blows Iphone away. 
Cons:. my friends are all jealous. 
Summary:. I am so glad for Motorola coming out with ,also happy i waited for the droid and didn't buy some other smart phone. love the fact that i can see the screen without my readers, i also like the the basic book that it come with (nothing) so i can set it up the way i ant to set it up. i have had all new phones since the wireless phone craze started and this by far blows away any phone that i have ever owned. Everything i have always wanted in a phone and more.. 

$$;
Pros:. Power, speed, customization, Bat-armored Chassis.. 
Cons:. Processor Heat,. My friends get Jealous. 
Summary:. First off i love the weight of this phone, with the metal chassis this thing can take a pretty good drop without damage.. I love the Android operating system, and feel that most of the issues about the phone are software related and therefore fixable with a good patch.. If I had to come up with a con, it would be that the powerful processor gets kind of hot in your hand while streaming video or doing something that taxes the mighty brain, but it is certainly cool to know that the processor is that powerful.. 

$$;
Pros:. I feel like I have my Palm Pilot back without all the crashes. Love having my calendar and complete address book with me at all times, along with weather at a glance, fun games (Space Physics!), music, great camera and GPS. Great phone!. 
Cons:. Touch is very sensitive, am always hitting something that jumps me out of what I'm using. Hate that I can't use an exterior button to make a a voice call.. 
Summary:. This phone had a huge learning curve. Verizon has an in-store class that is super in teaching you how to use it, as well as online tutorials. Droid is amazing with all of it's features. The GPS is very good and amazingly clear in satellite mode. The camera switches easily from camera to camcorder mode. Droid Market is easy to search and find everything you need. Google search bar is convenient and intuitive. The best accessory is the entertainment dock which makes the Droid a great bedside alarm clock and convenient for watching youtube or photos. I find the virtual keyboard easy to use, and the slide-out keyboard fine for when needed. This is a fun phone and I totally love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. everything...yeah everything. 
Cons:. nothing... yeah nothing. 
Summary:. sorry iphone...yeah really sorry. "Being exceptional at everything you do is not an attribute but rather an attitude."- Matt. an attitude that DROID DOES. yeah this is undeniable. 

$$;
Pros:. great display. good battery life. open architecture. fast. 
Cons:. None at this time. 
Summary:. I'm recommending this phone to all my friends, family and colleagues. 

$$;
Pros:. i like the slide out keyboard the androis 2.0 the google voice everything. 
Cons:. i love it all. 
Summary:. i have used this product for over a month now and my life suddenly changed from being late to my appointments now i'm on time and even early.. 

$$;
Pros:. Operating System. Fast CPU. Great Apps To DL. Great Calling Quality. Drag and Drop Music to SD card. Widgets. Great allround phone. Screen is lovely. 
Cons:. Heavy. Large. Not very style typed phone.. 
Summary:. Great for anyone who wants a TOP line smartphone with googles new OS installed . Great interface and easy to understand . I love this phone .. 

$$;
Pros:. Great GPS, Great minibrowser, Great email, Awesome display,. 
Cons:. The slide out keyboard is hard to use with adult size thumbs.. 
Summary:. I have never really liked the idea of a smart phone. It seemed like too many trade-offs. But the Droid is a really good PDA in its own right. It absolutely kills anything running Windows CE, trust me I've tried to make those things work. So for me this is how I can actually get away with carrying one device. Instead of a phone and a PDA or NetBook and remember to take that GPS on trips, I just carry a Droid. One thing really is everything I need. Like I said in the beginning, I never thought I'd own a smart phone, but I love this thing!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easily customizable,fast internet,great reception/coverage,hearing someone over this phone is crystal clear,loud ringtones/alarms, able to run multiple apps, great app selection, 2 keyboard choices: touch-screen or slide-out, voice command for google. 
Cons:. Nothing!!!!!. 
Summary:. Best smartphone ever!. 

$$;
Pros:. The google navigation system is the best in the world. The screen resolution is the best I have seen. I am comfortable with the size. The apps are great, love the browser speed and the phone as a phone has been flawless.. 
Cons:. Having trouble with the Wi-Fi, camera takes some time getting used to, keyboard is not the greatest. World Wide phone network by verizon would be nice.. 
Summary:. I like this product because I am google person and have been with verizon for 10 years now, it just makes sense. I like the overall design of the phone and the materials they used, it has substance. This phone got my attention because I feel the Google OS and its power to "see the world" is key in this industry. I also feel that the phone will be able to upgrade with the future and have many new features as needed.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the customization options. It also has awesome features. 
Cons:. It doesnt support LTE. 
Summary:. Great phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. totally customizable, all the way to the home screeen. 
Cons:. there is nothing. 

$$;
Pros:. it is fast and it is has great apps.. 
Cons:. when it has all of the apps on there going at the same time it sometimes crashes the phone. so get task killer app.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, apps (I'm a limited app user, however), ringtones.. 
Cons:. I have to make sure it's in my pocket bottom-first so the keyboard doesn't jostle partially open.. 
Summary:. Having used an iPhone for over a year, I find the Droid is every bit as good (and as cool). But there are some wonderful differences. Even though AT&#38;T claims to this awesome 3G network and complete coverage, I found so many dead spots (in well-traveled areas, e.g., down I-25 in Denver) that I wouldn't even bother with phone calls when I knew I was going to be on that route. But that's the network problem.. There were some quirks with the iPhone, just as there are some with the Droid, as mentioned, the keyboard tends to "slide out" when in my pocket top-side down (so the keyboard is down). The keyboard also requires that I orient my rather large thumbs appropriately; however, that being said, I virtually never use the physical keyboard. The touch-screen keyboard is at least as quick as the iPhone, especially when in landscape orientation so there is no need for the physical keyboard. I haven't been on the web enough to have required the physical keyboard, and the sites I've been on have worked just fine with the touch-screen.. Finally, the seamless syncing with my Google calendars is a big, big plus! There are some quirks with forcing a sync with both contacts and calendars, but I actually only ran into that once. I was able to force the sync and only wish I could remember how I did it so I could pass it on.... It is money well-spent and worth it! And not having to pay for ringtones is a hoot!. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding visuals, Facebook synchronization, open app store, multi-tasking apps, Google Maps, and a highly customizable OS.. 
Cons:. The keyboard is a bit flat, and the phone screams 'manly' to the point where it can turn off some people if the default settings aren't switched.. 
Summary:. This phone is a surprise for me-- as a long-time Verizon customer, I've been used to being snubbed on quality phones. As soon as the Droid came out, I decided to take the plunge and see why it was getting such good reviews-- and now I know. The phone is outstanding.. The screen is incredible-- its pixels make you wonder how you could ever look at a lesser phone's. Facebook automatically syncs with your contacts if you sign in, and although one might think that it would lead to some problems or take lots of time, the syncing is quick and seamless. The applications found on the store cover most of the same areas that can be found in the Apple App Store, although in the Android Market, one can get applications that compete with native Android functions; for example, I downloaded two separate browsers to try them against the default one.. I haven't yet brought up the Google Maps application, which is simply stunning-- and free. It gave outstanding directions to a house over an hour away from me, and it quickly synced and did what it said it would do. An impressive piece of work.. That said, the keyboard could use improvement. It's impossible to learn how to type quicker on such a flat keyboard. On the phone's default settings, it can be a bit scary. The phone states "Drooooiiid" in a mechanical voice every time you get a text message-- luckily it can be changed. The start-up shows a massive red eye staring out and almost pulsating.. The small problems though are minute-- this phone is amazingly outstanding, and after using a Droid, I don't think I could ever go to an iPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big bright screen. Fast downloading. All the apps I need for what I do. Easily customized. Lots of free apps, only had to buy a couple. Love Google maps. Speakerphone is sweet. 3 homescreens to organize apps. Good call quality.. 
Cons:. Not a con but the weight of the phone took getting used to. Would be lighter without the slideout keyboard.. I kinda wish that it had cut-paste capability when I'm working in the NoteEverything app.. 
Summary:. I had envied all my friends who had the iPhone. I'm a long time Mac user. But I had previous dismal phone connection service with ATT, dropped calls, could not use my phone in my house (ATT said it was because I had concrete walls), lost voicemails. When I heard about the new Verizon phones in November, I decided to check them out. I liked the look of the HTC Imagio but the internet seemed sluggish in the store. When I played with the Droid I was hooked from the beginning. All the things I said above are what I like. I have big fingers so the physical keyboard is a bit small. After some practice I do better with the virtual keyboard and like the auto-word feature. If you get the phone, download the free Advanced Task Killer so you can easily shut off un-needed apps if they launch.. A buddy and I did side by side comparison of his iPhone and my Droid as far as downloading YouTube videos. The Droid smoked the iPhone. He was envious of the high def screen on the Droid. Bottom line....If Verizon got the iPhone tomorrow and offered me a free exchange, I definitely would keep my Droid.. Updated. on Jan 2, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast!!!. Good overall feel (weight, size). Responsive Screen. Screen size and resolution. Verizon network coverage. Huge Market place. Email connectivity. Google connectivity (e.g. contacts, calendar ect). Wi-fi, GPS. Google Navigator (sort of). 
Cons:. Very short cord(s). Dial interface. Camera is slow. Takes some time to adjust to (i.e. learn the OS and how it functions). No native support for Outlook (a Google business account/app is required). Limited Video compatibility (no AVI support). 
Summary:. I was hesitant in purchasing the Droid after reading so many reviews complaining about the keyboard, contacts, calendar and other minor issues. But after biting the bullet and getting one I must say this is one of the better Smartphones I've used (and I've been using them for many years, since the first Palms and HP's on AT&#38;T). I'm have very large hands and must say that, while a bit cramped I don't have a huge problem with the QWERTY keyboard. Sure there are occasional typos but I've not found a single QWERTY that's any better (and I am coming from the AT&#38;T Tilt which has probably the largest and most spacious keyboard available). The onscreen keyboard (both in standard and landscape display) is good enough that I'm actually using the physical keyboard less and less.. The Market Place is great with TONS of apps already available and more coming. I've used gmail and google services for many years so the lack of support for Outlook wasn't a big deal. The phone is great with Google calendar and contacts (though people not using Google may have some issues, note: there is a workaround for connecting to Outlook but it requires the Google business app). Personally with the way the phone works it actually is better for me because I like having everything based online (i.e. on my google account).. I was a little upset that there is no support for AVI (DIVX) video but some quick conversions to mp4 solved that and the video playback on the phone is just GREAT. Video resolution and sound are the best I've seen outside of some very high-end HTC phones.. The built in Wi-fi and GPS work great. I get a quick GPS lock even with thunderstorms overhead (it's the quickest cell-phone GPS I've used and is on part with an actual GPS nav unit). The Google Navigator is great, though admittedly is not perfect (in terms of map accuracy) but it's still a 'beta' so I trust it will get worked out soon.. A note on service: I'm coming from AT&#38;T so I'm very happy with the coverage that Verizon has in my area (of course this will vary greatly but here in Nashville, TN Verizon coverage and 3G is far better than AT&#38;Ts). Also customer service seems FAR better than AT&#38;Ts.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast. lots of memory. screen size. keyboard. wifi. 
Cons:. keyboard needs improvement. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent phone - and the hi res screen makes the web, videos, and most other apps awesome. Bargain price for early adopters and the phone includes audible turn by turn navigation and more like a one time fee for an app to tether to your laptop.. 
Cons:. Apps still coming. I think I still miss an external phone button but there is already a widget to make speed dialing a matter of tapping the screen once for speed dial #1, twice for #2..... 
Summary:. just a matter of time before same widget or another allows redial of last call .. BUT you can dial and broswe at the same time - while surfing web you can hit home key, activate included standard phone widget or another, make call, chat while hiting home key, then browser widget to find you are right where you left off in the browser while talking away. The apple commercial and several reviewers are WRONG.. Updated. on Dec 27, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. The Droid has a gorgeous screen, great design, and a huge feature list. It also has Android 2.0, which now boasts a new user interface and a smoother experience. Battery life is better than many other smartphones on the market, build quality is up.. 
Cons:. The Droid's keyboard is flat, and sometimes isn't quite as accurate as it needs to be. The home screen is a bit laggy, and the UI still doesn't have the same polish that HTC's Sense UI does. Lack of multitouch built-in is odd considering HTC has it.. 
Summary:. The Droid is possibly the best phone on the market today. It competes directly with the Palm Pre, iPhone, and the other major smartphones on the market. It lives up to the high expectations of the competitive market, and has no trouble keeping up with, or surpassing it's "peers".. The phone flies, to be honest. Applications open instantly, run smoothly, and multitasking has no effect on the phone speed. Loading webpages is a breeze, as it takes very little time to render and process all of the incoming information.. The design is an odd look, that is starkly contrasting to the iPhone and Pre. Where the iPhone and Pre go for a smooth, sexy, sleek look; the Droid stands out with a sharp angular look, that seems oddly imperial, as if it should be commanding all of the other phones. The design is thin, especially for a phone with a full QWERTY. It's only slightly thicker than an iPhone.. The screen. OH, the SCREEEEEN. It's the best feature of the phone; it really is. It's double the resolution of the iPhone, and the colors pop. The size is huge, and really helps out the Android OS, which I've always found slightly cramped on a 3.2 inch screen. The responsiveness is great, and is second only to the iPhone. The screen still wows me every time I use it.. The lack of a call and send button has been called out as a bad design cue on the droid, but it's not called out on the iPhone or the Pre, and I don't quite understand the logic behind this.. I've been extremely pleased with this phone, and the biggest advantage it has over any other phone is that it has Verizon's service backing it up. Coverage is great everywhere I go, and it really helps when you're traveling abroad. Voice quality is great too. All of my calls sounded clear and natural, with calls sounding good no matter how many bars I had.. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this phone, and plan on keeping it as long as I can.. The Droid is not only the best Android phone on the market, but is also the BEST phone on the market in my opinion.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fully customizable, great display, touch controls are dead on. Google Voice is amazing.. 
Cons:. Still some issues with apps and some minor functionality glitches. Something that will be fixed as software fixes come through.. 
Summary:. Already returned mine because of a faulty earphone plug(it thought they were still plugged in and did not let me use to headset, only the speakerphone). A minor gltch with google voice sending texts twice if sent with virtual keyboard up. Camera issue fixed with update. Some sound issues through earphone fixed with new replacement phone.. Otherwise it is everything that was advertised. Able to do everything someone wanting to write and app wants it to do. Its app library is growing everyday. This phone can only get better with time as software programmers get into gear.. 

$$;
Pros:. Virtually everything about this phone is first class.. 
Cons:. Don't really use or need the slide out keyboard. Would rather the phone be smaller and lighter, but it's ok.. 
Summary:. I stay at the top of the smartphone chain. Although I have been a customer of Alltel/Verizon for about 12 years, I tried the IPhone for about three months. I loved the phone but hated the service in my area. When I saw the Motorola Droid, I bought it, canceled my ATT contract and sold my IPhone. In my humble opinion the Motorola Droid is a complete class ahead of the IPhone. From the slick interface to the incredible built-in speaker. All I have to say is The Best Phone Ever, Period...... Updated. on Feb 10, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. The notification bar. The thousands of useful free apps. The customization through widgets. Mainly, though, the realization that Iphone users think the have the greatest phone ever because it plays music and has over two thousand fart apps.. 
Cons:. It has to be recharged. It can't deflect bullets. In water, it sinks. When near Kryptonite, it's free metal detector app says its quartz.. 
Summary:. Bottom line, throw your Iphone at me head and I'll deflect it with my DROID and then kill you with my QWERTY board!. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, accelerometer, supports multi-touch, on screen keyboard (on portrait and landscape) are very responsive, autocorrect works well and is customizable. Takes very good pictures and the best video I have seen on a phone, w/ slideout qwerty. 
Cons:. Just a tad confusing at first. Only holds 3x4 grid of widgets on home screen if you keep the Google Search bar there.. 
Summary:. Coming from someone that has had Verizon, TMobile and Cingular/AT&#38;T, and a plethora of phones along with that (including Blackberry's, Sidekicks, Palms, LGs, and Samsungs) I can honestly say this is the best and most functional phone I have ever had. Its also one of the best Multitasking phones I have ever used as well (second up is the Sidekick) I really do love everything about this phone, the contact sync with Facebook and Gmail, the giant touch screen, and they keyboard. Yes, the keyboard feels flat and weird at first. You WILL press 2 keys at once a lot on your first day because of this, but after a day or two's use it becomes a lot easier and you find your sweet spot with the phone. The browser is incredibly fast. The default browser has Tap to Zoom, not Pinch to Zoom... but there is a browser on the Android Marketplace that supports Pinch to Zoom. (Dolphin Browser).. The app store is growing, and there are a lot of useful apps on there. I love how the store is set up as well. Apps/Games/Verizon When you make the selection it goes to Top Paid, and then Top Free, and Just in. Great organization. When you select an app, before downloading and installing you can read about it and see user comments on whether or not they like it, and their ratings. As soon as you download it you can rate it and comment it yourself for others to see. Text messaging is fast and organized (because its threaded messaging... Messages organized by contact). When you play around with the phone you find so many new things.. Like when you click on a Contact's picture a little bar comes up that shows their facebook status, and a bunch of options that you can perform like Text, email, call, look at their profile via facebook app, or Instant Message.. All in all it is a great phone I havent found a con that didnt get fixed or was something I can look around.. Best phone I have ever used.. 

$$;
Pros:. NOT on AT&#38;T, so it can actually make phone calls in addition to being a fun gadget. Stable, user friendly.. 
Cons:. A tad bit heavy.. 
Summary:. The best phone I've ever owned. The Android 2.x operating system is a pleasure. The touch screen is clear, bright, and very responsive. The camera works very well, and has a flash! I love having choice of 3 keyboards. About 60% of the over 20K (and growing by the thousands every week) Android apps are free. Contacts can be created and maintained via a Gmail account, and will sync and combine Facebook data into the contact list. Any changes are automatically sent to the Droid. Most importantly, it's not on AT&#38;T!. 

$$;
Pros:. Ive a scripture ap for church. It remembers my audiobook place. The google maps directions, traffic &#38; weather bug (ap) are REALLY handy. It surfs fast as a 'puter &#38; boots faster. This phone does it all: pics, gps, mp3.. 
Cons:. My hubby hit it the first time it gave us driving directions because the voice scared him. The battery lasts only about a day but I use it almost constantly. Had to go to ehow.com to get directions on how to use it.. 
Summary:. Well worth the money for the data plan and the phone. Perfect when traveling to eliminate dragging my computer with me. It can't access every webpage, nor every email, but it sure comes close!. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge screen. Very Responsive. The battery is great. A Hardware Keyboard, Virtual Keyboard as well. Very Thin. Android 2.0. 
Cons:. Nothing really this phone is great the keyboard is something that you will get used to the most you use it. 
Summary:. Updated. on Dec 21, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. OS is fast and strong. Physical QWERTY keyboard. Great Apps. Great Camera. Wi-Fi. 3G. Great Camera. 
Cons:. None with the phone. Lack of SIM card with Verizon is annoying. 
Summary:. Great phone for Verizon Wireless, I would even describe it as the iPhone of Verizon. Highly recommend it, you will not be regretting your decision. 

$$;
Pros:. Great everything that you could want from a phone. The Google voice navigation makes it worth buying this phone alone with out all the other great stuff.. 
Cons:. you can't back up your apps like an iphone does.. 
Summary:. This is a great phone and you do not have to be on At&#38;t to get it...lol. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful big screen. Android OS. excellent sound and customization options. Excellent product that I would recommend to anyone except my grandmother.. 
Cons:. A bit heavy for my tastes, but at least it's a direct result of using metal instead of plastic. The battery life could be better when Wi-Fi is on.. 
Summary:. I really like the iPhone for it's design and intuitive interface, but AT&#38;T was a killer for me. The inability to make calls from many hotel rooms and in some major cities (like NYC) made Verizon my only option as a carrier. And while the Android Market is nowhere near the App Store (in sheer numbers) at this point, they are growing and have most of the apps covered that I use personally. The Droid's interface takes some getting used to, but I can now navigate it with ease. The weight of the phone was a turnoff initially, but is due to the body of the phone being made of metal instead of plastic, so it is a "problem" I accept. I have had none of the problems that have been reported by some users. I do believe that there have been some manufacturing defects, but luckily that has not been my experience. This phone is faster than any phone I've used (including the iPhone) with multiple apps running at all times. Call quality is excellent. The learning curve was more steep than any phone I've ever owned, but once I read the manual and checked out some user tips online, I am loving it. Is it an iPhone killer? Probably not based on the hardware and software alone. Throw in the Verizon network and the difference between the two is dramatically reduced. In a perfect world, I'd own an iPhone running Android 2.01 on the Verizon network. Then I could truly leave my laptop at home most of the time. If you need the dependability of Verizon with their customer service, IMO this is the phone for you. If you get decent AT&#38;T coverage where you live and work and must have an iPhone, that's a decent choice as well. For me, this is the absolute best combination of features and carrier available. It's the best technology purchase I've made in the past three years and that is saying a lot!. 

$$;
Pros:. The touch screen is very responsive. The phone is FAST, making multi-tasking a breeze. Screen is bright and crisp. Many ways to customize your home screens with shortcuts, folders, and widgets. Call quality is excellent. Tons of apps to choose from.. 
Cons:. The only thing I don't like is that you frequently turn the volume up or down unintentionally due to the design and placement of the volume control. Keyboard initially is odd, but after a few weeks I was typing with no problem.. 
Summary:. The Droid has a ton of potential in the coming year. Developers are finally beginning to take the Android platform seriously because of this powerful device. Soon we will see apps that will give the iPhone a run for its money. Switching from the iPhone was not a bad call with this device. I love how much more I can do simultaneously with this phone! I couldn?t even respond to a text message using my iPhone without having to exit ANY app I was using except iTunes. Now I can listen to Pandora, text, browse the web, download and install apps, and launch tons of other applications all at once! I'm glad I switched, and if you're on the fence, GET OFF! Come try this phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. everything. 
Cons:. i like everything. 

$$;
Pros:. Best OS out, amazing screen, sick keyboard, and best of all IT'S VERIZON: which means it can actually be used for internet and calls like a phone should be.. 
Cons:. hmmmmmmm too awesome?. 

$$;
Pros:. 1.screen quality is second to none. 2.feels solid in my hand. 3.google maps w/ voice navigation is free. 4. amazing sound quality. 5. reception is great. 6. can do anything a phone could possibly do. 
Cons:. nothing that is not expected from a device like this. 
Summary:. the first thing i will say is: This is NOT an iphone so im not going to compare. i love both devices and what they do, they do very well. they run on to OS platforms and work differently although there are some similarities. that said, this phone is simply phenomenal! its very responsive, the touch screen works really well, it has tons of expandable memory, the picture and screen resolution is awesome, and its a beast of a multi-tasker. as i said in the cons portion of this review, i havent found anything really annoying that i didnt expect from a device like this. and anything that i may eventually find will probably only be software related and can be fixed with updates.. if you are on the Verizon Network and need an awesome smart phone that can do just about anything you would expect a device to do, then you should definitely check the Droid out.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's on Verizon is the biggest plus. I can call on the Droid when I can't on the iPhone. I like the speed. ( I have a 3GS). Update 2.0.1 fixed the camera focus issue.. 
Cons:. Apps not as polished but some of the latest are close and getting better. OS update 2.0.1 fixed a number of issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, Keyboard, Application Capabilities, uniqueness, camera, and Customization. 
Cons:. Battery Life. 
Summary:. I love this phone so much, I have to usually charge it at least once in the middle of the day!. 

$$;
Pros:. Features, Smooth, Fast, Great apps, Best Phone Ive ever had. 
Cons:. In Call features: not being able to end call with a button... thats about it. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, screen, call quality, open source, range of apps. 
Cons:. Battery usage, though imminent update said to solve the problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Three keyboard inputs, Android OS, WiFi, Navigation, Verizon. 
Cons:. Need video capability, wifi sometimes hangs, half to wait on industry to catch up with accessories. 
Summary:. I waited over a year before I finally made the move to a smartphone. I looked at the iphone and yes that phone changed the game but the Droid is a player. The only things I would change about the phone are text suggestion prompts when using hard keyboard, software that allows dual touch (yes the phone has the ability), more apps for the 2.0 OS and more accessories like a XM dock. There are a few querky things with using the phone like using the dial pad during a call, learning the menu button and figuring out a widget vs app but anyone with half a brain will be an expert in a few days. Go the store and give it a try I'm sure you'll love it..

Pros:. Easy to use, versatile, fast, smooth. Connected to Exchange server without a hitch. Took 30 seconds.. 
Cons:. Big and heavy.. 
Summary:. I didn't need the manual because everything is so easy. The phone is very fast and there is typically no lag when thumbing through screens. I didn't think I wanted real keys, but I love that too - you don't have a virtual keyboard blocking your view. Games are fun, video and pics look great, marketplace has a lot of great apps, connect to facebook was something new to me and was surprisingly smooth and easy - one click and everything was imported. Very cool.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything is great....Have no problems with anything.. 
Cons:. No cons at all.. 
Summary:. Best cell I ever had!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, takes the place of my old cell, my PDA, and my neuvi! Satellite navigation is awesome. Receiving e-mails on my phone is convenient and google calendar is a great tool. Small profile, fits easily in my pocket.. 
Cons:. battery life!!!. 
Summary:. I am 50+ years of age and this is my first smartphone. It is a bit scary at first, but I am having a wonderful time learning all its capabilities. It may be "intuitive" for my 30 yr. old son, but I have to work at it a little. I still love it and would recommend it highly.. 

$$;
Pros:. DOES EVERYTHING YOU NEED IT TO AND MORE. VERY FAST AND RESPONSIVE TOUCH SCREEN.. 
Cons:. BATTERY LIFE IS SHORT. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything is a pro.. 
Cons:. Nothing is a con.. 
Summary:. Wayyyyyyyyyyyy better than the iphone. Best phone ever.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast, great service, great apps, simple, screen is great. 
Cons:. with a case on the screen is hard to slide up. 
Summary:. This phone is a fantastic phone for anyone. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing screen, best in the market. 5MP camera takes amazing shots. The browser is fantastic and better than my Iphone. You can make you own 'widgets' which is a great feature.. 
Cons:. Comes with no manual, hence you have to download one online.. 
Summary:. Best phone on the market thus far. Will hurt Iphone sales for AT+T's lousy coverage is well known.. Open operating system, hence applications are being ported at rapid pace. Verizon will sell one million of these by year end, hence huge momentum. Upgrades based on user feedback. Phone has a big upgrade on 12/11. Slide out keyboard works well.. Updated. on Dec 4, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Multitasking.. Travel laptop replacement.. Fast network, available virtually everywhere.. Good battery life.. 
Cons:. No good video player available.. Had to search market for good audio player.. 
Summary:. As my first true smartphone purchase I have been thoroughly satisfied with the Droid phone. Battery life lasts around ~2 days with my normal usage. I have found that on quick trips this phone can completely replace a travel laptop since it handles internet, email, music, and video so well. Google Navigation has also come in handy many times when I have found myself travelling without a GPS, or in a new city looking for something to do. I think that the Android market could use a little more quality control on the applications, as some (not many) have the tendancy to freeze-up the OS or not work, but in general the reviews section of the app market lets people share this information.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best display, hands down.. Very customizable.. Responsive touch screen.. So many apps.. 5.0 megapix camera, very clear photos if you know how to use a camera.. 
Cons:. Keyboard is shifted to the left making it a bit awkward.. Some customization features cost.. 
Summary:. Bottom-line? Best phone I've ever had. I don't think I will ever stray far from Google ever again. I can't wait for the Google OS for PC or Netbooks to come out. Google does an amazing job. Easy to use, fun to use, and it doesn't get boring within the first month like every other phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. 3g coverage AMZING!. it is multitouch. GREAT APPS that iphone dosent have and many that the iphone has!. MULTITASK! i dint even know what itWAS. IPHONE KILLNER? NO! THIS IS IPHONE WORST DREAM (IPHONE DESTROYER). (I AM AN IPHONE OWNER) 2 of them. hacked)). 
Cons:. keyboard takes time to get just2 but u do.. it feels slow BUT ITS NOT it has the same proccessor as the 3GS iphone. icons not soo nice but they are ok.. GREAT PHONE for sure!. 
Summary:. Im a owner of two iphones , i love them! BUT!!!!. the Droid became my new cellphone and I LOVE IT! i dont miss my iphone too much... but i get to do alot more stuff in the DROID than my iphone... YES like vnc , video ringtones , rss in my lockscreen , ETC!!!!. but the droid has as much potential as the iphone does or even more and i belive the android software has a long way to go.. NO MORE DROP CALLS OR NO SIGNAL!. IF the IPHONE was in verizon i would probably still have it BUT the droid its PERFECT and GOES BEYOND WHAT I EXPECTED.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen - beautiful, crisp. Keyboard - The keyboard is one of my fav things about the phone. GoogleNav - great!. Notification Pane - Great!. Google Voice search - Great. Fast internet - Woo hoo. 16,000+ apps - Sweet. Speaker - Loud. Notifications - :). 
Cons:. Gold trim - yuck; but it's negligible in even noticing it. Outer edge of screen - Metal/paint chips...again, not very noticeable but still irritating. 
Summary:. I've had the phone since November 6th, and have loved every minute of it.. As I said in my headline, it's the only phone I've ever owned that has grown on me, instead of losing its magic.. It's easy to use once you figure everything out (and there IS a lot); much easier than my WinMo Imagio. It's so versatile, and you can do so many things at once...I was listening to Pandora radio, surfing the web, and answering text messages, responding to emails, etc all at once...the notification shade made interacting with the phone sooo easy, and actually fun.. The camera can take good pictures, but it's finicky...I think there will be software update for it 12/11? Hope so.. Video quality is excellent, but I have yet to attempt sending videos and playing them on my laptop.. I did have a bug where any external sounds (ringer, music, voice nav) would be routed to the earpiece instead of the external speaker if I was using the external speaker when an incoming call was received, etc. I removed Slacker radio and this problem has only reappeared 2 times since then.. The feel of the phone in your hand is sophisticated, smooth, quality, and is worth overlooking the gold trip and flimsy volume rocker/camera button.. It's important to remind everyone that this is the first iteration of hardware, and the first iteration of software for this phone, and all first tries are never perfect (iPhone...no MMS for years after the first intro?!?!? No multitasking??!?).. Two other people also bought the Droid after interacting with mine...It sells itself. IF you know how to use it, and take the time to learn.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, smart, intuitive, awesome screen. Did I say fast?. 
Cons:. A little hard to get used to, but once you do, it's awesome!. 
Summary:. This phone does everything you could ever think of. If you can't find something or how to change a setting, it is there, just might not be as easy to find as a Blackberry. If you ever need to find out how to do something, Google what you are looking for and the Motorola forum will have the answer. If not, submit a question, and Motorola is awesome at getting back with the answer.. If you are concerned about battery life, give it a week to get the charge fully up to par, and turn off Bluetooth and WiFi when you're not using them; very easy to turn on and off with this phone.. Highly recommended!. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing screen, google integration, google nav, apps, video camera. 
Cons:. Poor still camera. 
Summary:. I was waiting to buy a new phone from Verizon for 6 months,but they didnt have any phones I wanted. I almost got an imagio, but I'm glad I waited because the droid is awesome. Being able to customize it with apps makes it much more useful. Besides the pros and cons, the battery life could be better but with normal use it lasts for more than a day. The bottom line is, the droid is not just the best Verizon phone, it is a good phone, period.. 

$$;
Pros:. google maps navigation. 
Cons:. flat keyboard is small. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone is fast, the screen is amazing, the feel is solid, the soft keyboard is easier to use on the larger screen, the speaker kicks "a" ... Facebook integration.. 
Cons:. The hard keyboard is a little small, but I got used to it easily. I don't like the flash on the camera. My volume toggle is loose feeling, but solid, and I wish the charger was on the bottom.. 
Summary:. I didn't even have the G1 for a year before I got the DROID. I also didn't even handle the DROID before I bought it. I seriously have never had a nicer phone and am so glad I didn't buy a mytouch(cause my g1's keyboard crapped out on me) I've never been one to like the iphone, but I don't know why I would need one over this phone. I say I because I'm sure there is other reason people want it, but this phone is the bomb diggidy if you ask me! If only there was a tweetdeck app for it =/. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast screens. excellent and intuitive interface. voice search that WORKS. excellent sound for tunes and phone. great phone book. easy self sync with Facebook info. upload with ease. great battery life. 
Cons:. minimalistic music controls (no stop and no external buttons for player only use). not necessarily intuitive interface. low light stills are grainy. Verizon stores WAY behind online pricing and not budging. Very slow cold boot (ie MINUTES). 
Summary:. Obviously, the Droid has delivered much more than I thought I was buying. I especially love the battery life and sound quality. I mean, it is a phone, first and hopefully foremost.. I got this on Vacation at the family get together, and everyone liked it so much, it became the buzz...let's get the straight dope, ask the Droid! the voice browser seldom missed it's target.. The navigation we tried several times, and every time, it took us the most direct and expeditious route. When we moved it around, it quickly resets and presents the new altered route.. We did have 1 error on which side of the road the destination was on.. I moved all my iPod songs off the iPod, into the Amazon MP3 folder on the droid, and the Droid added all the cover art and plays with slightly better bass than my Nano.. It was a bit of a chore "discovering" the upper message curtain, and also figuring out that is needed for some basics you would not expect, such as USB discovery, but the web already has plenty of answer pages.. All in all, a home run. Import the multi-touch, which reportedly the Droid in Europe enjoys, and it's very likely a grand slam for Big Red and Motorola.. On the nits - I got mine via Dell - special on-line offers for $119. Wow! Cheaper than what I paid for the Razor 3XX 3 years ago. And the curtain interface, and all, although not entirely first cut or auto intuitive, after you get used to it, it gets fairly easy to start to discover where things are on the phone before you have to look them up. Since I am doing all that in the first week, with time, I can only expect this part to be even easier.. I think why everyone is complaining about the camera is due to the low light imaging, and only because the video camera is so superb. Oh, and one slight correction of another's review, at least on my Droid, it gives youtube sharing of video by default. Big Red, add FB sharing of video, it's a no-brainer.. As for weight, no issue, it feels good to me.. My port of my service is not complete, but my Droid is fully outgoing functional at this time. Hopefully, this is the issue with the cold boot being very long.. It's a great phone, even the iPhone junkies that have seen it seem to appreciate it. I love the iPhone (my wife has a iPhone 3G), but I think if I had to pick, and I had to, I chose the Droid. So far, I'm very happy with the choice.. And to see full bars at home, instead of the one dot and constant drops of AT&#38;T in my house, I am very pleased.. Updated. on Dec 9, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, Outstanding Free GPS (did I mentioned Free?), excellent UI, QWERTY, 5mp Cam with Flash, Solid construction, removable memory &#38; battery, network coverage, OS openness, app market selection is great considering its infancy.. 
Cons:. Camera could be faster (hope it gets corrected Dec. 11th).. 
Summary:. At the end of the day the Driod is a very powerful and useful device that matches and surpasses rival devices in many departments. If you admire iPhone and Pre like myself but reluctant to switch carriers for a particular device then that situation has been remedied by the introduction of the Motorola Droid by VZW.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fully customizable, easy to learn user interface, voice turn-by-turn navigation a plus.. 
Cons:. No flash player. 
Summary:. Best Phone on the Market in my opinion. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the free navigation, and how internet friendly it is.. 
Cons:. The media player need a little bit of work. 
Summary:. I like this phone cause the price was right with www.e-phones.com at $149 with a 2yr contract and the features it has are great, I love it. 

$$;
Pros:. great screen, like the physical qwerty keyboard, plenty of apps, good interface, fast 3G speeds. 
Cons:. interface is good, but took a day or two for me to really learn it. 
Summary:. will recommend this to anyone. 

$$;
Pros:. it will not compete with nokia n95. 
Cons:. n95 and n97 are the best phone i hve seen forever. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, keyboard, Android 2.0, micro-usb.. 
Cons:. No real Outlook/Exchange sync. 
Summary:. Like a lot of people hear, I liked the iPhone but did not want to go back to crummy AT&#38;T service. It is REALLY bad if you live in a mountainous area like me. This phone does everything I want to do, some better than the iPhone, some not as well like the music player. Not a deal breaker for me. I still use my phone 50% of the time to actually make phone calls and the phone clarity between this phone, the iPhone, and the BB Storm, is no comparison. Texting and emailing which make up probably 40% of my other use are also better and easier, once again, just my opinion.. 

$$;
Pros:. Keyboard (even though it sucks it has one). Screen. Fast internet and processor. Growing App center. Battery life. Multitasking (had it to 3 apps and no problems). no droped calls in a long time and works in places I thought it wouldn't work. 
Cons:. Camera Does suck but I hear its software not hardware and is going to be patched. I guess its a little heavy but I don't see a problem with that. Apps also crash or don't work with the android 2.0 software conflict or droid phone itself don't know. 
Summary:. It was pretty hard for me to find some cons and there was still more pros I wanted to put in but couldn't. I just really like to show some of the iphone people all the stuff I can do with my coverage while theres keep on trying to find the 3G signal. Its great to have the fastest if it works. I can't really say too much with AT&#38;T and so I am not going to say too much more bad things with them but I know there are a good amount of people that do wish they had the Verizon service and not the AT&#38;T service. I do like the new IPhone and AT&#38;T comercials that are coming out to try to kill the Droid &#38; Verizon comercials that are already out there. I think the conection on Verizon is fast enough for a phone. Ping is at 177ms, download is at 838kbps, and Upload is 509 kbps. Which is pretty good for me. Well that is about all I have to say on the phone hope this is able to help with anyone thinking about buying it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, Google Marketplace, Navigation, Speaker quality, calling quality, Screen, Wi-Fi, battery life and a whole lot more.... Including Physical Keyboard. 
Cons:. Camera and video recorder are not too great..... No voice dialing yet.. 
Summary:. Google and Verizon have saved Motorola from an impending doom, and I couldn't be any happier. I have long been a Motorola fan but have disliked Verizon and Google in the past very much. I have become a big Verizon fan thanks to their customer service over the last year (seriously!). Now I can say I am a Google fan as well.. This phone does everything I hoped the Samsung Omnia would do, but couldn't thanks to Windows Mobile, and improves it 100 fold. The speed is unmatched besides the iPhone. The Google Marketplace is fantastic and offers a lot of quality vs. the Apple quantity. The call quality is probably the best I have had since using a regular cell phone.. The Google navigation, although in beta, is excellent. It actually saved my hide a few nights ago when I went out to dinner and had to do a quick Navigation on the phone. And it also saved my butt when we forgot to bring the CD for a young relative. I was able to very quickly go to Youtube and play the song off of that.. To summarize, it?s not an iPhone killer. I hate the terminology and frankly I love the iPhone too. It?s an unbelievable phone that appeals to non Apple fans, non AT&#38;T fans, or non ETF fans. I fall into the non ETF fan category but this phone makes me forget about that completely.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, easy to learn, and very powerful. 
Cons:. keyboard is too small for my fingers, keys too close together, and wish it was easier to zoom in and out. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything Am Handicapped so the tactile and keyboard are a very good help.. 
Cons:. No global delete of Email if emails are not wanted. Little sketchy on on learning all of these things and software but I am getting there.. 
Summary:. Everything is so easy to use. I am an IT guy so I need emails sms calanders the easier the better,. Onlything I havent tried is VPN as I cant find a decent Terminal Emulation Program for IBM AIX Systems.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compared to other smartphones this device definately stands out. The call quality is excellent, which is sometimes sacrificed with other smartphones. The turn by turn navigation with google maps is a great alternative to other native apps.. 
Cons:. The camera could be a little more dependable, but this is to be patched on the new OS update. Over the course of time I believe app developers will concentrate more on developing Android centralized programs. I would like to see easier pc link.. 
Summary:. Although this device does not have syncing software for PC interface, it does sync very well with google. If you are a google user you will absolutely love the availability to sync contacts, email, and calendar wirelessly.. The device has a solid build with little plastic hardware. This goes a long way with users that have been paying hundreds of dollars for devices made entirely out of plastic. The look and feel of this device makes you comfortable with the 200.00 tag.. The web browser and voice activated searching is very user friendly and allows users to find what ever they are looking for whenever they need to.. I have owned all the palm devices, all the blackberries, all the WinMo phones, and the iPhone. This combines the user friendlyness and touch interface of the iPhone, the OS dependability and speed of the blackberries, and the call quality of other cell phones. Absolutely my best phone!. The. 

$$;
Pros:. The call quality crystal clear. The speaker phone is very loud. Powerful vibrator. The screen is very sharp. The browser is fast!! .Google navigation/voice search will blow you away. Physical, and virtual keyboards (nice touch). Just great.. 
Cons:. The camera is not good. Pictures are bad for a 5mp camera (update hopefully). Physical keyboard (not the best) takes some getting used to. Had a battery issue. Drained quick. It was going to be a deal breaker. I exchanged battery, all day usage now.. 
Summary:. A great phone! If you never had an android device before, give it a try. Very good multi-tasker. I never had an iphone, but I know it's an excellent device. Forget the phone wars, get what you like. Just remember you have good choices out there, and the Motorola Droid is definitely something to look at.. 

$$;
Pros:. lots of apps, stuff you need, and probably never knew you needed. beautifull screen, top notch google GPS built in, emails, calendar, you name it. great sound on calls as well as speaker. 
Cons:. none! most of the complaints can be traced back to user issues- apps that are downloaded that chug battery power, snap on covers that block the speaker or mic... things like that. moto will be doing OTA updates to fix other issues- I love that!. 
Summary:. I have had this phone for a week now, and LOVE LOVE LOVE it. its a great phone, does more than I imagined it would, and since I did not defect from another smartphone, i dont have any comparison complaints.... I cant imagine anyone not being happy with this phone, unless they are too impatient to wait for the minor issues like bluetooth dial to be fixed with the coming updates, or folks who are so in love with, and used to thier previous devices that they never should have switched.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have been a Verizon customer for over 10 years and have owned at least 5 different types of phones. I must say that this has phone has really changed my mobile experience as it allows me to stay connected to the online community with ease.. 
Cons:. The lack of multi-touch with the on-screen keyboard is a drawback for two finger typing. However, I usually will type with only my right index finger, thus do not struggle with the lack of this feature.. 
Summary:. Like, live it, own it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Google calendar, Windows Live mail, and Apps run fast and easy. It has a good keyboard. Have not had to "reboot" the phone yet because it hung up or froze. Screen is large, and resolution is larger than most phones.. 
Cons:. Its a little heavy. No extended battery available yet. Phone does not use standard usb mini plug, so have to get plug in chargers and car plugs for it (good news is they are surprising cheap on the internet).. 
Summary:. I really like this phone. Its is fast, easy and fun to use, with great graphics.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the browser and the fact I can stream pandora while still doing other things. 
Cons:. the pull out keyboard is a little hard to use and doesn't give you the read ahead that the virtual keyboard does.. 

$$;
Pros:. im a owner of the droid and im very happy with it. 
Cons:. battery life... 
Summary:. im very happy with it i love it i love the keyboard just have to get use to it and the phone it self.... 

$$;
Pros:. Screen res excellent, google maps, GPS Navigation, Lots of great apps, size is nice, real keyboard, customization, email works great, it actually works as a phone!! Unlike the iphone. Great sound quality.. 
Cons:. Needs an all caps button, maybe I haven't found that yet.... 
Summary:. I was waiting and waiting for Verizon to get the iphone. Love the Verizon network and was willing to wait. All of a sudden the Droid appeared and was a great match to the iphone I've been wanting. There were things about the iphone that weren't so great, dropped calls... data clogs ... so I went with the Droid. It's down right amazing and now I don't want an iphone! Get it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast. Reliable Verizon service. There's an app for everything. Beautiful screen and solid feel. Easy to operate. Totally fun.. 
Cons:. Whatever cons there are, there's an app to fix it--and if there's not, there will be one very soon.. 
Summary:. The browser is really great. The full version of the latest flash, I hear, is slated to be added to this phone in early 2010. No Flash Lite stuff, we're getting the real deal.. I love the barcode scanner app--it's fun.. This phone lets me access my company network, lets me sync with Outlook Exchange, and is awesome for social networking.. I was amazed at how well this phone understands my voice when I'm searching for things! The other day, I told it to find a restaurant and within seconds I was looking at a page on Yelp with a phone number. I pressed and held the number and it popped up with a list of options--one of which was to dial. I dialed and ordered for pick up. It was so simple and didn't require a high degree of effort--which is great when you're driving and can't spare the attention.. I have a friend that speaks with a thick Cuban accent and the phone understands him perfectly too. I didn't realize that voice recognition had become so advanced.. I can't even begin to list the things this phone can do. When it comes right down to it, whatever you might be able to come up with that's a weakness in the phone's operation, there's probably an app to fix it. If there isn't an app to fix it, there will be.. I recommend to everyone to get this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Gorgeous screen. -Great Network Coverage with VZW. -Google GPS turn-by-turn for free! (this is a biggie). - Growing App market and ability to customize. -amazing video quality. 
Cons:. -No native pinch-zoom in browser. -App market not as polished as apple's. -photo quality poor in low light. 
Summary:. This phone, in my opinion, is the best alternative to a touch style super phone like the iphone. In many aspects this phone is superior to the iphone, but there are definitely areas where the iphone still outshines it; most apparently the apps. What apples has a definite advantage in is the sheer number of people with their phone, and therefore the number of people developing apps for them.. That said, the android platform is taking off, and I suspect that within 6 months the android market will make leaps in bounds in catching up. This is the best mobile device I've had the pleasure of owning, and being able to get it on. Verizon's ample 3g network is great. Of all the current phone options and their abilities I would still rank iphone fist, but the network tradeoff brought me to Verizon, and to the close second of the Droid.. 

$$;
Pros:. The attributes that jump out at me are the razor sharp screen, the myriad of useful applications, the speedy processor, and the ease of use with the touch screen keyboard.. 
Cons:. The slide out keyboard I find rather cramped and difficult to use. I find I nearly never open the phone. The camera boasts a 5MP camera but in "take-a-quick-shot" situations I find that the shots are often blurry if the phone is not stable.. 

$$;
Pros:. I've got two words for you: "Android Marketplace" ! ! !. 
Cons:. The short battery life is the only thing that I have to complain about so far.... 
Summary:. The touch screen is extremely intuitive and the device is faster than my home computer- no joke! I'm thoroughly impressed!. 

$$;
Pros:. Most everything. 
Cons:. Keyoard takes a bit to get used to. 
Summary:. Besy phone yet for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android 2.0, Google Navigation for FREE, Google Application Support, Open Source Software.. 
Cons:. No online email support other then Gmail. Physical keyboard takes some getting used to.. 
Summary:. This phone is simply amazing. I have had it for over a week now and I am still amazed by the features and functionality that the phone offers for FREE. This phone is made of metal which gives it a very solid construction and feel. I have had phones that I simply thought I was going to snap in half if I opened them too quickly, not the case with the Droid.. The thing that makes this phone even more amazing is the support of Google with the applications that it offers. There are so many applications that you can get but I live by the sentiment that it is not the quantity but it is the quality that matters. People have said that the Droid has less Apps then the iPhone, which is true, but the Apps that matter are all there and then some.. Furthermore, I have many friends that have iPhone's and the Droid outshines their phones in operation and applications, whether the iPhone is Jail-broken or not.. Really it comes down to what are you going to use the phone for, if you need a rugged phone that has great functionality and usability then the Droid is for you!. 

$$;
Pros:. Well the screen is higher res than any phone out there. Google works great and everything runs really fast and I can have multiple stuff open and it doesn't slow down!!! wooooohooo. Plus my company account was super easy to set up. 
Cons:. None really. The face book app is kinda just skin and bones but if you use the browser to use facebook...it works just fine. 
Summary:. At first many people were like, Ooooh the keyboard is too flat.. waahhhh but the keyboard works like a charm as totally easy to use. Then some people complained that the phones touch screen is jittery but it is super smooth and very responsive. People just don't want to admit that this is as good as the iphone or better...plus the GPS is very useful and very accurate with pictures of where you're going and of your destination when you get there...What the F?! Why don't other phones have this totally useful feature....also there are more than enough Droid Apps available every app on other phones are just as useful except the droid runs super smooth with google. Overall, best phone EVER!!!!!.

$$;
Pros:. Fast running phone on all functions and apps. Beautiful screen. Great media play. Real querty keyboard, plus portrait and landscape touch keyboards... all methods of typing for everyone. Super google turn by turn navigation. Lots of fun apps.. 
Cons:. Keyboard does take getting used to. Would have been nice to have a user guide come with the phone.. 
Summary:. I and 3 family members have had the Droid for about a week now, and we all really love it more than we thought we would. Our contract was up with Verizon soon and we thought about the iPhone. We did side by side testing of the Droid and the iPhone... and in our area the Droid ran everything way faster, and we all agreed that the Droid touch keyboards were easier to type on. Very surprised by these results, as well as the fact that AT&#38;T is very slow and sparse in our area.. I thought the full querty keyboard would be difficult as other reviews have stated, but within a day we were all used to it, and have had no problem since. (Hubby has really big fingers, but has mastered the keyboards!) I also like the landscape touch keyboard as well. I am not much of a touch screen typist, but it is easy to use. Another thing others mentioned in reviews is the turn on button on top of the phone. It is difficult to find sometimes, but that is great as I tend to turn my phone on by accident a lot. Not one accidental turn on or pocket dial yet! I'm sure that is why they made the button so hidden, plus a swipe unlock on the first screen. Droid is all metal, so I guess I can't destroy it (I am hard on phones and have cracked many plastic parts.). This makes it a bit heavy, but I kinda like the weighty feel of it.. Love pretty much all the functions on the Droid so far. Calling is wonderful... after all, isn't it a phone? Clear, no drops, phone pad goes dark while at ear and shows up when pulled away from ear... nice. The net runs great over the phone network, and even better when on wifi. So happy with it. Txting is fast and easy too, keeps each person you are txting seperate, so it is easier to follow a conversation when txting more than one person.. Media... music sounds great and is so easy to load off my laptop. Pandora app works very well. Video is great and loads great too. Youtube runs beautifully. Photos are better than most phones, but not as good as my last phone, the Voyager. There are some nice photo editing apps you can grab off the google marketplace. Speaking of the marketplace, I have been able to find every kind of app I needed, as well as some no one needs but are just fun. Drinking a glass of milk, star wars light saber, foggy screen... Family agrees that it is addictive finding and playing with the games and apps. I love the New York Times app, playable guitar chord app, and downloadable books! I even made use of the barcode scanner.. Navigation... tried the google nav several times, even tried to mess it up by going the wrong way but it worked great. Wonderful turn by turn and visual help. Nice Car Home button with a screen specifically made for use while driving. It has big one touch buttons for voice search, contacts, maps, and nav. What a great idea instead of searching through your phone for small buttons! Way to go google! The voice search for the net and the nav works really great for me. I use it all the time.. Don't quite like... can't organize photos, but I'll bet there is an app for that. No speed dial... really?... BUT, I did find a way to put my speed contacts on one of the home screens, even did separate ones for txting, calling, and mailing. Different menus for each page or app you are on is kind of confusing at first. Would have been nice to have a better user guide come with the Droid to explain some of these things.. This is a great fun phone for a regular family of people who love to do EVERYTHING on their phone. We have become Droiders!.

Pros:. I like that this phone exceeded all my expectations. It is more of a computer that has a phone as a perk.. 
Cons:. I do not like the pictures I have taken thus far.. 
Summary:. If you want a quality phone that will do much more than you expect, you should get the "Droid". You'll be glad you did..

Pros:. I was a Blackberry fan for years but. this cell phone "rocks!" Great response with Verizon and truly incredible speed.. 
Cons:. This is the first of many to come so it might be wise to wait six months.. I'm pleased to have bought this on the first day of release.. 
Summary:. Great value and incredible reception..

Pros:. Large, very responsive, bright and detailed, touchscreen. Physical qwerty keyboard. Google maps. Easy to use navigation. Google street view. Fast processing. 5MP Camera. Applications galore. Customization, widgets Call quality.. 
Cons:. Battery life is okay. Camera can be slow. Not a big fan of the light sensor (for screen brightness being located on the back of the phone).. 
Summary:. This phone is incredible.. The touchscreen is slick and fast. It is just as responsive as the iPhone (if not better, I have an iPod touch to compare). The resolution and quality of the screen in fantastic. I had no trouble viewing the screen in broad sunlight. I love having a physical keyboard at my disposal. A keyboard that I did get used to very quickly and can hammer out a text or email very fast. I perviously had a LG Dare which is a dedicated touchscreen phone without a physical keyboard and am much happier to have one again when I need it. Texting and writing emails with the touchscreen is still very easy, especially with auto-correct/spellcheck, but there are times where I would just much rather have a physical keyboard to type. I personally find the phone to be very appeasing to the eye as well.. The google services provided such as google maps and navigation are incredible. I was so sick of the standard Verizon navigation system which is absolutely terrible compared to this. It is so much easiler to just type in an address or business name without having to find out and punch in it's sate or zipcode every single time as VZ-nav requires. The incorporation of google street view is a luxury providing the ability to see exactly what your destination and route looks like. Plus google maps is easily able to provide you quick directions without having to startup a turn-by-turn readout if it is not desired or needed.. I absolutely love the 2.0 operating system. The phones runs very smooth and quickly. It is quite easy to use (especially after playing around with it for a bit). The web browser is great. Pages load fast and are displayed very well on especially on such a large screen. I love how the phone is able to display what applications are running so you can optimize performance and battery life. The application store is very good and it is growing every day. I can even get several apps that I already have on my iPod touch and that are offered on the iPhone. I especially love having an widget that always displays the weather on the home screen and top notification bar if I should choose. The ability to search google by voice is incredibly easy and frighteningly accurate (especially funny when you try dirty or odd voice searches to see if it can recognize what you are saying). Google SkyMaps is ridiculously cool. Customization is easy to do whether it be wallpapers, shortcuts, widgets, or even ringtones. Especially the ease to make custom and free ringtones. I also was thrilled to be able to put all of my music on the phone without having any playback issues. It is also very cool to be able to link your contacts with your facebook account so a person's facebook picture and profile-link are merged with their contact information. I could go on for a while more about the operating system and the things it does, but simply put 2.0 rocks.. From what I can gather the light sensor for the phone is on the back located next to the camera flash. This is used to detect brightness for the camera and to auto adjust screen and (qwerty) key brightness. I have noticed this at times because of the way I tend to hold the phone which can lead to the screen auto adjusting for a dark setting because my thumb or finger may be blocking the sensor which can be semi annoying but easily and quickly fixable. The camera is a little slow to load and review pictures but it is not as bad as people are making it out to be. Battery life is okay, but this is my first smartphone so I have a skewed idea of what to expect when it comes to judging that. And it is a new phone that I do not want to put down. I would also like to see some adjustments to the music player.. Luckily most of these cons can and probably will be fixed in a software update. Including the camera speed.. Overall I would highly recommend this phone to anyone. Especially to any customer on the Verizon network. I am a phone enthusiast. I have been waiting for a phone like this with all these features,\ to come about for some time now and I can happily say that this was well worth the investment.. Updated. on Nov 15, 2009.

Pros:. Verizon's great service and coverage area The software is better than the iphone's and the screen is just as responsive as the iphone. Also, the crystal clear screen is huge. The slide keyboard also allows you to utilize the full screen horizontally.. 
Cons:. One of the few things that bugs me is the mini usb cable instead of the regular. Also the keyboard keys are a bit shallow and take some getting used to. (which I am still doing). 
Summary:. First and foremost, the service is great. I had an iphone for a month and had tons of drop calls. If I was in a dense area of people I just couldn't make a call. I would go 5+ hrs sometimes before I could even make a call.. Something that I did not realize when I first got the phone was value of the slide out keyboard. Having used an iphone for a few weeks, I actually thought the keyboard was going to be a problem. But after using the Droid's keyboard, I fell in love with it. It allows you to have a full size horizontal screen which is great for browsing the web along with everything else.. I never thought a phone would be able to compete with the iphone, but Motorola has stepped up to the plate in a big way..

Pros:. Clean best sound of any phone; clean clear screen; intuitive basic apps; ease of use for screen and real keyboards; easy voice dial; great google calendar/email/etc. synching. 
Cons:. Too much to choose from; so many apps; so many icons; for working person, too diverting from tasks at hand. 
Summary:. I've used so many phones for more than a decade now; this is clearly the best for clear clean sound which is first and foremost for me in a phone. Verizon system has great coverage. Unlike iPhone/ATT combo, I haven't dropped a call since I got it a week ago and I'm on it all day. Appreciate long call time, appreciate fact that it takes batteries; appreciate that I can use mini-SD card for music and not face Palm problem of filling up the memory over and over; appreciate ease of emailing with big keyboard for big fingers; appreciate GPS maps cause on and off airplanes all the time and need quick mapping - this thing is right there, right away, showing me where I am and directions to next place. Synching with Google Calendar, and with all my Contacts in Outlook and on Gmail really huge. I was afraid this phone would be too much like a toy with music and games as its main event. Clearly it does all that if that's what you want. But if you just need a real workhorse that does it all and does it excellently, this is the main event. Makes the iPhone feel like a toy to me now, a fun toy no doubt, but just a game machine next to this Mean Machine..

Pros:. Great Screen... Great Apps ... Great Interface ... Gotta LOVE the GPS NAV and Car Mode... Everythink works flawlessly..... 
Cons:. I just dislike VZ practices.... 
Summary:. Good Bye iPhone...... Hello Future..... This product is THE BOMB.. the Future.... Compared to iPhone.... Better Screen.. way way better resolutions. Better interface (Widgets). Better Network (I hate VZ but they do have superior network to ATT).... Voice Nav. and Voice Searches..... Car Mode.... FULL Turn by Turn Nav.. Open Platform... Vs. Closed... Who do you think will win..... Google... always been more ethical and user oriented..... iPhone more apps..... ya right... wait just a year... you will see.... As a developer... I would rather develop for Android anyday rather than for Steve Job..... Apple Fan boys... sorry... You will be always boys... time to grow up and get an Droid.... Android not necessarily a Moto.....

Pros:. Everything. This is my first touch screen phone and it is amazing!. 
Cons:. Does not support bluetooth calling via voice commands on bluetooth device.. 
Summary:. You need this phone!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Verizon Reliable. + = +. Android Customizable. 
Cons:. Needs more quality free apps, but the basics (Evernote, Pandora, Qik, Shazam, Google Voice) are covered.. 
Summary:. I like the DROID quite a bit more than the iPhone (and I had previously owned a 3GS) because its primary job of being a phone is done way better on Verizon. I love the added keyboard and the openess of Android. That coupled with the power of Google is wildly awesome. I know most people gripe about it being non-GSM, but honestly, I don't have any plans of leaving American soil in the next 5-8 years. All that being said, I didn't mind a fully touch phone, so I might have been able to save 100$ by going with the DROID Eris.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. the large 3.7 inch display. 2. the android 2.0 OS. 3. the media player. 4. the pattern unlock feature. 5. CUSTOMIZATION!!! CUSTOMIZATION!!! CUSTOMIZATION!!!. 
Cons:. I really wouldn't call these cons....just things that kind of irk me so far as compared to my previous phones. 1. man this phone is HEAVY. 2. somewhat complicated. 
Summary:. It's really hard to find cons with this phone. Before I buy cell phones cnet is the first place I go to look for reviews. So i waited two weeks before I bought the droid. If you are thinking about purchasing this phone....dont base it off of these reviews...go play with it yourself. People complain about the keyboard, the camera, and the browser, well i absolutely love the virtual and physical keyboard, the camera takes great pics so far, and i have no complaints about the browser. One of my friends has a G1 and another has an iPhone...we all compared phones and my G1 friend is going to switch to verizon and my iPhone friend (whom is a freakin mac lover) actually LOVES my phone...especially when i showed him my VZW monthly bill. To sum it all up...I love this phone....I have never been excited by a phone, but I can't keep my hands off this one...im constantly downloading music and apps and backgrounds....there's even an app that keeps track of all my bills and banks accounts...IM IN LOVE!!!!.
