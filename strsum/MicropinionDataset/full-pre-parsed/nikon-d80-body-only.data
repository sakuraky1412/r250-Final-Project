with its 10mp i can make large prints and yes this is perfect for me when im shooting a sunset  .

and want the photo in my living room     .

i dont get tired carrying this in parades , birthday parties , family reunions and wine festivals     .

i get more control over color and depth of field , my photos come out more artistic rather than  .

plain snap shots my precious daughter has gold speckles in her eyes i never noticed before     .

the software that came with my d80 to edit photos let me really get close in my photos and  .

honestly i like the way it shoots so i rarely do touch ups unless something needs a tiny warmth filter i recommend this to anyone starting out , its kit lenses might not be the best    but    can easily be replaced  .

with better ones     .

i fully suggest fx lenses    they fit my d80 , d300 and i even hear they fit the d3x (my next camera on my wish list)  .

i do love the versatility of adding grips and taking extra sb600's with me to family re    unions     .

the pocket wizards can really make this a good cam if you know what you're doing .

i am bias to nikon because i got my first nikon when they were made less bulky than the 1rst canon film cameras ( which didn't feel right in my hands  .

) way to bulky and i have large hands the nikon d80dslr is feels very comfortable in my hands , the controls are similar to the nikon film cameras , so learning curve is very easy  .

lots of features some not available on more expensive digitalslr's at a reasonable price  .

plenty of menus submenus , focus modes lots of options to personalize to your own type of shooting if you are an advanced amateur or a proffessional this is the camera for all types of shoooting plus blow    ups with no noise or pixelation problems at 11 x 14 enlargements as to my comment about the 1rst canons  .

they have made great progress in reducing the bulkiness of their digitaldslr's and all dgital as has nikon  .

unless you want to spend a small fortune on a camera that becomes obsolete within months  .

buy this nikon  .

don't go spending $2000  .

00    $3000  .

00 on a 21 megapixel camera  .

they too will become obsolete a short time after their release if you are not shooting fashion models or travel the globe to photograph wildlife in exotic places  .

just my opinion .

i love my nikon d80  .

it's easy to handle almost like a aim and shoot camera .

this by far and away the best camera i have ever shot on  .

all the control i need for any situation , fast , nice menu layout , most importantly great pictures and a ton of accessories available i have used the canon equivalent both at work and at home quite extensively before making this purchase and i must say the nikon out performs it in every way every time best camera i have ever had  .

for the prosumer you cannot go wrong .

it's been years since i had my film slr  .

i finally broke down and purchase the d80  .

i love this camera  .

i've gotten pictures that my friends say look like a pro took them  .

they only think i'm having problems with is remembering how to implement all the options that are available or let's say user error  .

you cannot go wrong with this camera .

i have been an avid shutterbug since the age of 9 when i bought an old box camera at a local sale that makes 43 years of photo taking  .

i even collect collect camera's  .

i started buying nikons about 5 yrs  .

ago the n80 i have a large amount of accessories for this camera so the d80 is a logical joice , all lenses fit the d80  .

so if you don't have previous lenses you may concider the d40x which is the same megapixels  .

the photo quality is amazingly sharp even when you zoom in on a jpg on the computer  .

i also use photoshop 7 so i do recommend a good photo computer program to enhance photos you like  .

do not take this like you need a photo work program to get good photo's just better pictures colors and i also change pictures around like you see in the magazines  .

i have shot professionally (film camera's) weddings , books , brochures and so on  .

trust what i say the film camera has it's place in photography the only problem is , it is in my camera case now and most likely will stay there  .

if you are concidering buying the d80 please allow me to help you make up your mine  .

contact me at n8ygn@aol  .

com with any questions you may have  .

good luck and keep taking pictures .

i have owned this camera (with the 18    135mm lens) since march '07 and have several thousand great photos to show for my investment  .

as a gadget guy , this camera does everything i ask of it (which is not much at this time) and more  .

i am just beginning to scratch the surface of the camera's true potential  .

the more time i spend with it , the better i am understanding how all of the settings work with or against each other  .

i have 2 batteries and 2 high speed 2 gig sd cards , and very rarely run out of battery or memory  .

(that's +/    900 shots total  .

my wife thinks the camera is too hard to use , so she plinks around on our old point       shoot digital camera  .

but , when she wants keeper photos , she calls on me to be her personal photographer  .

i have become the designated photographer for our families , brownie group , church , work , buddies , sports teams , school functions , etc the only thing i can think of that would make the camera easier to use is a hand    strap from the base to the right strap mount that would make carrying the camera for extended periods (disneyland , parades , races , etc  .

) easier my next investment for the d80 camera is a faster mid    range zoom lens to capture indoor sporting events , concerts , museum type shots easier and with higher quality .

i have had this camera for six months  .

i have rented higher end d200s and d2xs for special events  .

i am very impressed by the ease of use of my nikon d80  .

i create some very impressive images with this precious piece of technology and love doing it .

for about 4 to 6 months i have been reading anything i could get my hands on about dslr's  .

i is set to purchase the canon xti when an acquaintance i know said to her it didnt give the image quality she thought it should  .

that sent me back to reading posts , buying every camera magazine i could find  .

to get to the point , i purchased the d80  .

i loaded the images on the computer i printed them , and its by far more impressive then i had hoped it would be  .

the pictures are just so clear i cant get over it  .

i've had some good 35mm slrs and only point and shoot digital cameras , one expensive point and shoot  .

i truly thought it wasnt possible to get a clear , good color , picture from a digital camera , right from the camera and not having to retouch it with ms image pro 9  .

printed they look as good as any 35mm i have shot  .

if youre doing what i is doing , looking reading and wondering , take it from me you will be just as surprised as i is when that first image comes up on the monitor  .

i know a perfect score shouldnt be given for most things but i gave it one because the d80 is what i thought couldnt be had in digital pictures .

this camera is packed with goodies , i am very happy with the nikon d80  .

i got the 18    135mm lens and it is great  .

i looked at the canon rebel xti but it felt really cheap in my hand while the d80 really feels solid and it is  .

i have dropped mine  .

from a desk and it did not scratch a thing  .

this is simply the best out period  .

this camera is just brilliant  .

the menu system is intuitive and easy  .

photos are just superb  .

supports large capacity sd cards (ie sd    hc)  .

auto mode does everything , but if you want to start playing , there is a 149 page manual (yes just one language  .

) which allows you to adjust so many parameters and settings so appeals to enthusiasts aswell as novices  .

i use with the nikkon 18    200mm lense and i am just blown away with quality , colour , resolution , clarity etc takdees sheikh  .

a jump from film to my first dslr  .

i tested a number of other brands but fell in love with nikon  .

the d80 camera is light , well built and easy to use  .

a great number of features give you the ability to really creat inovative shots  .

i carry it with me all the time  .

the long battery life is a blessing  .

i love the 18    200dx vr lense  .

such versatility with this particular lense  .

photography is my hobby and i enjoy it immensely hope you dicover the same  .

i bought this camera with the 18    200 vr lens the first couple of pics i took with the camera were of the moon which i thought would be really hard because not only is this my first dslr but it is also my first digital camera  .

the pics turned out really great  .

i couldn't believe how much details i got  .

i didn't even use a tripod , the lens is awesome and the vr works great  .

i cannot tell you how easy it is to change the settings and get the picture exactly the way i wanted  .

the camera performs perfectly in low light  .

it is so much fun to use  .

the command dials are perfect  .

you can change almost everything you need (iso , image quality , size , shutter speed , aperture) which is great because you don't have to go into menus every time you need to take a picture i is comparing this camera to the canon xti (aka 400d) and the sony alpha (as , i'm guessing , everyone is) and i'm glad i chose this one  .

the sony alpha felt so cheap when i tried it , and the canon xti as well  .

this is of course not the reason why i chose the d80 , but i've done a lot of research during the last 3 months and everyone seemed to agree about the fact that the d80 is the best among the 3  .

probably the sony offers the best price at the range of features it is offering but my suggestion is add the extra money and you will not regret it  .

at least you know you are buying a camera from a well established name in the world of (d)slrs and , most importantly , lenses  .

for the canon , a lot of people seem to agree that it has exposure problems for back    lit objects  .

you would not want to pay this amount of money in a camera and have a problem like that the lens is great  .

it is an all in one lens  .

it is all i need from wide angle to a decent zoom range  .

there is a problem however with the flash , it casts shadow if you are shooting at 18mm (the widest angle of the lens) .

if just want take a point a shot picture the camara do it for you or if i want take a more complex profesional picture the camara just do it too , work excelent to every one .

it is great to open the box , intuitive to assemble , and point and shoot some sharp shots , even in the worst light conditions there are a host of controls that will allow greater control for experts .

my story is that i bought a d80 with the 18    55mm kit lens i heard great things about the canon xti so i decided to give it a try as well i is disappointed , i shot some photos of my girlfriend with both cameras , compared the quality , d80 beat the xti by far on my opinion i returned the xti and the 18    55mm lens , i got 2 different nikkor lenses   28    80mm and 70    300mm  .

the camera is beautiful , the body is just awesome , i thought i is going to like the xti being a little smaller , but it felt like a cheap toy , i did not feel right with it , the d80's got to be the best purchase i've in a while .

i am more than a beginner , but not close to being professional  .

if you cannot take good pictures with this camera , give it up  .

i researched and researched and looked at canons , olympus , and sony  .

the canon rebel xti is a close second , but when you hold and shoot these two cameras          side by side , the quality and solid feel of the nikon is obvious  .

it is like the difference between a chevy and a lexus  .

the lcd is big and bright  .

if you are looking for a digital slr , and you look at the d80 , you will buy it .

this is an exceptional intermediate skill level cam if you are learning and earning your way up the nikon camera chain  .

it is not a pro level camera but it gets close d80 prices for this discontinued camera are very afordable betweem $600    700 for this $999 beauty  .

if you do not have the skills and or bucks for an fx d700 or d3 get a d80  .

you'll love it .

never feel sorry to brought this camera .

today it's one of the best cameras i've ever owned  .

i've made about 60  .

000 photos and i could say it works really like a clock even when the temperature is extremely low splendid choice  .

as i said before i like that fact that you can use your lens from your other camera the photo quality is great easy to use light in weight i like the fact it has a 10  .

2mp the speed could be better maybe 4 frames per second other than that is a great camera i would recomend this to anyone who loves cameras i rate this camera @  and 1|2 stars  .

i bought mine with the 18    135 mm kit lens and added the 70    200 f/2  .

8 soon after  .

what a dream  .

not too heavy on the neck or wallet  .

very functional  .

easy to use and setup  .

fun , fun , fun  .

i almost always shoot in manual but the few times i've used auto have not let me down one bit  .

focuses quickly  .

the view finder is easy to read even with 50+ year old eyes  .

had mine for 18 months and love it  .

price is even better now .

absolutely fabolous camera once used with decent lens  .

this camera has the right amount of pixels for the sensor size , the right design for a photographer and the right price for this changing industry  .

i'm an amateur photographer and love this camera for its picture quality and flexibility in use  .

i can shoot in any of the auto modes and get great pictures  .

white balance is very accurate in auto , though sometimes auto mode overexposes the image now that i've had the camera for a year , i rarely use auto mode  .

i like how easy it is to change settings without toggling through the menus  .

there are many short    cut keys on board to quickly tweak white balance , iso , aperture , shutter speed , metering , exposure , focus area , etc  .

it's just easy to use  .

shooting in raw mode is a huge plus for computer editing  .

there are minor editing capabilities on the camera , but i prefer to do all editing in photoshop elements 6 i also like the wide range of accessories available , especially since i did not know what i wanted when i first bought it  .

i did skip the standard lens and splurged for the af    s nikkor 17    55mm 1  f2  .

8g lens without regret  .

the images i can get from just this lens are phenomenal  .

i'm an art quilter and when i travel to shows  .

i take pictures of quilts from 6+ feet away in bad light (flash use is typically prohibited)  .

i have to capture white thread on white fabric  .

not only do i see the thread in the images , but i see the individual fibers of the fabric when i zoom in  .

i also have a nikkor 100    300mm zoom , a sigma 10    20mm wide    angle , and the sb800 flash with a light sphere from gary fong i considered the nikon d40 because i'm an amateur and i new the d200 is way too much for me  .

i'm glad i chose the d80 because i probably would have replaced the d40 with a d80 within the first year  .

i cannot imagine replacing this camera any time soon  .

it will suit my needs for 10 years or more if this is your first digital slr , i highly recommend an after market book or dvd to understand all the functions of the camera       the manual is way too technical .

after a year of frustration with a near    slr from panasonic , i debated the merits of this upgrade  .

but , the speed and accuracy of this nikon makes it well worth it particularly when trying to catch the fast motion and fleeting expressions of small children  .

this camera satisfies the photographer but is simple enough for a point    and    shoot user to love  .

nikon is just plain brilliant .

awesome , i bought it with the 18    135 as a kit  .

lens good for the cost , but not great  .

upgraded recently to 18    200 vr wow  .

i am a semi    pro who does mostly industrial/commercial photography  .

90% of my 1st shots of a subject are great , and i seldom have to revisit a shoot .

i just received my camera on friday just in time for my trip to verona , italy  .

took over 200 pictures with just a half of a battery , all amazing photos  .

most photos were taken on auto , cannot wait to get my own personal touches to the photos  .

do not believe all the bad reviews  .

great camera .

the best , i bought the sp    600 flash , 10    24mm and 70    135mm  .

nothing works better  .

add a canon pixma 9500 and you'll rival the best money can buy .

my first digital slr is the d70 , which i loved  .

i upgraded to the d80 , which has been a wonderful choice  .

i have not been dissappointed at all  .

now that the prices is a little lower ; it is a good investment , for those who did not have questions about spending d300 money .

fantastic reuslts in every shooting circumstance  .

the high iso parameters allow great available light photography , virtually taking a photo in the dark  .

i am still learning to set it up but so far , with the use of a photo tweaking program , the results are great  .

i recomend you purchase the md    80b power grip  .

i've left it on over night and the batteries have yet to run down and i've taken over 1000 pictures  .

equiped with the 18 to 135 mm lens and the 70    300mm lens there is not much you can miss  .

the camera is quick and responsive  .

although it makes for a big brick hanging around you neck it is a great piece of quality equipment .

love this camera  .

i used a friends rebel xti for a week to try it out and is ready to buy canon  .

read the reviews about the d80 and decided to try another friends d40  .

loved the d40 and decided to go with the upgraded d80  .

d80 is absolutely the best dslr under $1000 period  .

everything from image quality to quality of the actual camera is head and shoulders above the canon sub $1500 category  .

cannot believe nikon has the d80 priced where it is when it is very comparable to the d200 .

many quality cameras are currenly available in this category of slr's  .

i am very pleased with my decision to purchase this particular camera , nikon d 80 , with the kit lens 18    135 mm  .

if you take the time to read the manual , learn all of its features , (practice , practice , practice) , you will be amazed by the versatility of this particular model  .

an absolute pleasure to use .

brilliant  .

i work for a online printing store and this camera gives great results both from my camera and my friends  .

i would reccommend this camera to others  .

this is my first digital slr (nikon f4s)and i really love it  .

it is fast and easy to use in auto mode for my wife who is a point and shoot person  .

and works great in manual modes  .

it shoots a little over exposed in p mode so have to set to     .

7 in full sun light , but if it's cloudy set it back to  .

read ken rockwell's directions , big help with getting started  .

i have the 18    135mm lens that came as a kit and am very happy with this lens  .

the 18    200 is a better lens but 3 times the price and after taking over 2 , 000 pictures on my alaska adventure and washington's olympic nat  .

park i'm very pleased with the results in all kinds of conditions  .

i purchased the 70    300 nice lens but not sure i would do it again  .

i got used to the menu on my trip but towards the end things got really busy and i switched over to auto and i'm still very happy with the results  .

i wish they had not gone to the sd chip as i had to buy all new ones and the filter size is different also , but if you don't have other camera stuff this won't matter  .

the sdhc chip i purchased with fast and did not have any noticable lag even when shooting is raw  .

i is surprised how long the batteries lasted  .

i took 3 and only used 2  .

battery life lasted more than 1 full day of shooting even using the camera flash for fill light  .

oh one big gripe the lens hood has to come off when using the flash otherwise you get a shadow in your picture  .

would i buy again  .

oh yea  .

the nikon d80 is a great camera to have  .

it is very fast , can easily be customized , and with 10  .

2 effective megapixels , its the way to go .

basically a d200 w/out 5 frames per second , 1/8000 shutter speed , and weather proof body  .

outstanding performance  .

great for someone who wants to move up from a point and shoot , but wants more than what an entry level dslr can offer  .

large and bright lcd  .

viewfinder is the same one as the d200  .

like the viewfinder , the nikon d80 has the same sensor as the d200  .

why should you choose this camera over a canon  .

for one thing it a fast start up time of about 0  .

18 seconds  .

for another reason the noise at high iso settings of this camera is less than the canon 400d  .

it also shoots faster that the 400d (i've been comparing this camera to the 400d , but it really is designed to match up to the canon eos 30d)  .

this camera also has a status lcd on top of the camera which i prefer over a combined lcd  .

the accessories available for this camera are great  .

you have most nikon lenses and flashes  .

by the way , nikon is at the top of the line in flashes  .

this camera is also built a lot more solidly than the canon eos 400d  .

it's not weather proof , but it has a metal chassis and an outer shell of plastic  .

there are several rubber seals and grips  .

these seals protect the camera better than just plain plastic  .

this is an outstanding camera that will take anyone far  .

you could be a hobbyist or a newspaper photographer , this camera can do it all  .

i highly recommend it  .

u know what  .

just get one , u'll see what i meen  .

beautifullllllllllllll  .

i've owned many different nikon slr and cannon slr cameras  .

this is my first digital    slr and i love it  .

i can set the top dial to manual and do everything myself or use one of the other settings and get just a great of pictures  .

(actually better , i've still got some room to improve my skills)  .

i'm the local amateur photographer  .

my pictures and services have become more requested since i bought the d80  .

i love it .

it is a great step    up from a slow point and shoot  .

i have really enjoyed owning this camera  .

i love this camera  .

i upgraded from the d50 and i'm so happy i did  .

i use this camera with the 85mm f/1  .

4 and the 18    200 vr lenses and could not be happier  .

i love the ease of use , user interface , responsiveness , speed and color rendition  .

i'll keep this camera and be happy with it for a long time to come .

right out of the box , charge the battery and take some nice shots with the 18    135 zoom  .

i'm an old school film shooter from the days of the great nikon f and digital is a brave new world for me  .

but with this camera , i feel very well equipped for exploring it  .

some of my stuff is published and it's already looking better  .

overall i rated this camera as a 9  .

previously owning a d50 and using a d200 for a month (my dad's) the d80 is closer to the d200 as far as functionality and overall picture quality , even though it's almost $400 less than the d200 i've found the auto setting to be a lot more consistent in shooting compared to the lower models    the exposure and f    stop settings in auto tend to be very close in a single setting manual modes are very easy to customize without having to delve into the menu  .

provided buttons around the display and thumb wheels make settings a breeze to adjust image quality with a decent lens is exceptional  .

focus speed is very fast and allows multiple shots to be taken without much buffer time between shots  .

a faster memory card is highly recommended when shooting in nef (raw) format , as the file sizes can exceed 12mb per shot depending on the situation the battery life is consistent with all of the nikon dlsr models    it lasts forever using the ittl with nikon's sb flash series produces clear and correctly exposed pictures i highly recommend this camera versus the d80 or the d200 , unless the d200 offers capabilities you must have as a professional .

i love this camera  .

i recently took a very huge leap and purchased the nikon d80 about 2 weeks ago  .

i went from my canon s3is to this and wow  .

i am glad i did  .

i've been researching my next slr camera for about 6 months and is pretty convinced that i would go to another canon , as i've always liked canon , that is until i got my hands on this beauty  .

i is hooked from the minute i picked it up and started to play  .

i'm new to the world of slr's and this is a very user friendly camera  .

everything from the 2  .

5 lcd to the in    camera editing , the 18    70mm lens that came with it (it has the metal mount)  .

i also purchased the 70    300mm zoom  .

i took it to the beach and took over 200 pics  .

with the polarizer the colours were rich and vibrant (right out of the camera)@ so much better than any other digital camera i've owned  .

the images are crisp and razor sharp  .

the camera is incredibly fast with virtually no start    up time , it's ready to shoot when you  .

are  .

i'm still learning how to use it so i have not come across anything negative about it yet (although i seriously doubt that i will)  .

the only thing i have had an issue with is trying to fing the manual focus ring , i suspect this will be easier to find once i become more familiar with using it and is in no way the fault of the camera all in all , i have no regrets about buying this camera and will never own another point and shoot  .

it feels good in your hand , it feels solid , it's very simple to use for the beginner and advanced enough for the semi    pro  .

it is a fantastic purchase  .

i just upgraded from the d50 , the model that is no longer available , and have been very impressed with this camera  .

i have always had nikon cameras , even back in the film camera days , and this particular model is not at all a disappointment  .

it's fun to use , the larger media view area is fantastic , the colors are striking , and all in all , well worth the cost .

this camera is the one i is directed to by a professional mentor , every pro seller , and numerous reviews both on and offline (including this site)  .

i spent almost 6 months researching dslr cameras and that culminated in two hours of side    by    side and 'in hand' comparisons , taking many shots in ritz cameras , the place i final made the purchase  .

the d80 easily outperformed everything under $2000  .

in the comparisons here , it is stacked against cameras well over $2000 and rated well my first con comment is not really a reflection of the camera as much as it's a consideration for larger hands  .

the second tho , is a major loss for me , as i prefer macro photography to all other types i brought d80 home and is taking good shots in 15 minutes , without reading a single word of the manual  .

in 15 days , i is taking shots that were so good that one of them won an award in a citywide weekly contest  .

this camera is easier to use than my first two 'point and shoots' yet fully controllable now that i've moved to slr equipment if you're a first time slr buyer , this camera will hook you in seconds and it seems many , many people agree that it is one of the best options possible .

i am a semi pro photographer , this is my 4th nikon and this camera rocks  .

ease of use , full of options , slave flash capable , and fast startup if you are in the market for a rockin digital camera , the d80 is for you , you cannot go wrong with this camera  .

canon who  .

this works well with all nikon lens  .

great feel  .

superb programs  .

the pictures are truly professional quality .

this is by far a fantastic camera  .

i is pretty much satisfied with using my d50 and d70s simultaneously for assignments , but i just couldn't resist on getting a 10  .

2mp camera  .

if you do a lot of cropping , those extra megapixels do actually come in handy  .

however , as with any digital camera , there will be a few quirks  .

my d50 overexposed shots while my d70s underexposed  .

the d80 has its quirks too  .

it overexposes highlights which can easily be corrected by setting the ev to    0  .

3 or more  .

also , when the built    in flash is used , even with the iso bumped up , the d80 tends to underexpose (i use an sb    600 anyway , i just find the built    in flash to be rather weak)  .

other than that , the d80 makes the most of my lenses and then some  .

i is not disappointed at all  .

do not get me wrong , the d200 with its 5fps and almost weatherproof body is a plus , but i tend to shell out more money on lenses than on bodies  .

the d80 is superb .

i gave the d    80 a bad review , after taking two home that had major problems  .

went looking for another brand and could not find one that had the features and felt as good  .

the sales person said give it one more try and it is the best thing i've ever done  .

all photos have turned out great  .

low light is not a problem either  .

i'm giving nikon d    80 thumbs up .

great camera for the amateur who wants excellent images and a useful feature set in a camera that is a pleasure to use  .

although great images are the most important aspect of advanced photography , the ease of use and versatility of the machine itself are not far behind  .

this camera fills the bill in all categories .

i am an advanced beginner and i am just delighted with the d80 slr that i've had for about a month , my wife's early christmas present to me (i had to have it  .

)i am hoping to soar to new photographic hights with this wonderful addition .

if you are looking for a digital slr , do not pass this one up for at least a look see , it is quite the digital slr  .

we love it so far , but learning what it's capabilities are will require some of your time for sure  .

what we really like is that at turn on it is ready to shoot in a nano second , and you wont miss anything unless you blink  .

prior to this we were using a nikon coolpix 8800 , and at the time of this review it is in the shop for the third time for the same problem , (lens error) that has yet to be fixed , we would strongly suggest going with a dslr like this and save yourself the $1000  .

00 mistake that we made  .

great dslr  .

this is my first digital slr after years of prosumer and pro film canon slrs  .

after a weekend of putting it through its paces , i am really impressed  .

did i want to get the shot and no time to think about it  .

shoot in full auto  .

got time and want to play  .

full manual gave me all the creative control i wanted  .

program , aperture and shutter preferred modes all dead easy to use as were the preset image type modes  .

macro shooting in mixed light industrial setting to outdoor winter seascapes did not even have it breathing hard  .

terrific colour saturation , sharpness and speed out of the 15mm    135mm zoom optics  .

my only big gripe is how it selects iso settings  .

i had it set to fine , small images so that may have had something to do with it bottom line , this is a canon killer  .

it's not a 30d but it feels like a more serious robust camera than the rebel xt and xti and , at cdn$500 less than the 30d , it's a lot of camera for the dough  .

nice job nikon over to you canon .

i had been planning to buy a dslr for a long time  .

i planned to buy a xti but after seeing d80 i know i really want the d80  .

so i bought d80 with 50mm f1  .

gee , what an excelent combo  .

i can take very very sharp and beautiful photos  .

i love the camera so much and it makes me want to take photos all the time  .

it is a such joy to use the camera  .

it feels really nice in my hand  .

i am glad that it uses sd card  .

it is a lot smaller to carry around  .

the battery last very long  .

it starts up so fast that i do not need to put it in stanby to take photos  .

the lens is really good for low light and it focus really realy fast  .

love it  .

this is one fabulous digital slr  .

i've always been a canon fan but once i saw the lovely big viewfinder , the perfect    sized lcd , the great 18    135 lens , and its perfect size , i just had to switch brands  .

canon's on    board flashes have never had the same metering as the add    on external flashes , whereas with the d80 , the built    in flash gave absolutely perfect exposures i recommend this camera very highly  .

note   i bought a sandisk 2 gb ultra ii card , and it does take about half to one second for the picture to show on the lcd  .

i think this is no fault of the camera ; its just that for such a huge card , the card's memory size is too large i think  .

with a normal jpeg and large file size , which is the ideal setting , the camera can take 500 photos on the 2 gb card  .

i'm glad i got that size .

it is affordable when you consider the level and features of this camera .

since this camera just hit the streets less than 2 weeks ago , i obviously haven't had this for a super long time , but i moved to the d80 as an upgrade from the terrific d50 , and the d80 takes care of every single minor nitpick i had with the d50 , and then takes it even beyond that  .

moreover , since i moved from the d50 and not a d70    series , i is thrilled that the d80 uses secure digital (sd) flash cards as with the d50 , the d80 just feels terrific in my hand  .

i is concerned initially because the ergonomics of the grip have been ever so slightly modified (more like that of the d70s than the d50) , and i really liked the feel of the d50  .

however , once i got the d80 and actually started using it and shooting with it , the concern evaporated quickly  .

the d80 is a complete success ergonomically this camera is blindingly fast  .

it's senseless to really even try to quantify it because the numbers (less than 0  .

1 second to start up) just don't convey how instantaneous shooting with this camera is  .

there's no discernible shutter lag , and shot    to    shot time is as fast as you need it to be  .

the d80 can fire up to 3 frames per second , up to 100 jpegs deep  .

amazing for a sub    $1 , 000 camera the things missing from the d50 that the d80 addresses  .

backlit lcd , superimposable gridlines in the finder , depth of field preview , one    button bracketing , bright and large viewfinder , one    touch zooming on picture playback , and a snap    on clear plastic cover for the monitor as a bonus , some of the in    camera retouching options are fantastic  .

you can take a color shot , then convert it to b w with a red filter (still preserving your original image)  .

you can utilize red    eye reduction (in the uncommon instances when it occurs at all) , and nikon's d    lighting is the digital equivalent of dodging and burning , and i love it the autofocusing on the camera is staggeringly fast when coupled with the right lens  .

like other nikon dslrs , the d80 has an independent af    assist light (some other cameras rely on the flash unit for this)  .

for af lenses utilizing the screw    driven focusing mechanism , there is a noticeable increase in focusing speed over the d50  .

you can also employ an 11    segment dynamic af grid and select which segment will be used for the point of focus a word about the pop    up flash   it's brilliant  .

rarely does a camera with a built    in flash get it right so often  .

i took numerous flash photos in sometimes varying and difficult lighting situations , and the d80 nailed it every single time the lcd is the best i've seen to date on any camera  .

plenty of cameras have 2  .

5 monitors now , but this one has 230 , 000 pixels and is so sharp and detailed  .

you can view it from any angle in a 170    degree arc  .

similarly , the viewfinder is a major improvement over both the d50 and the d70 series  .

rather than utilizing a cheaper pentamirror like some of the competition , nikon elects to use a genuine pentaprism which allows the finder to be nice and bright  .

additionally , the diopter control knob with detents for each setting is a welcome change from the slider on the d50 image quality is suberb , as one would expect from a 10  .

2 mp dslr  .

i like sharp , vivid pictures , and the d80 delivers  .

i have not had any of my photos from the d80 printed out yet ; only viewed them on a 19 monitor , but they look terrific the d80 is highly recommended as the perfect camera for the advanced amateur or enthusiast photographer  .

it bridges the gap between the d50 and the d200 perfectly  .

pair this camera up with a high    quality lens , and a good photographer will have a tool with which stunning images can be made .

the d80 is an incredible camera with one of the easiest digital menus in an slr today  .

in addition , the built in editing function is unique and very useful  .

i just recently moved from an nikon f100 to a d80 and this is not a step down  .

i have taken several photos with the camera and i cannot believe the clarity    near film/better  .

built in help menu is a huge plus , no more seeking out the manual  .

in addition , the d80 has many customizable menus that allow such things as on demand grid lines via func (custom button)  .

sure canon has the same mp , but you may miss the shot thumbing through cumbersome menus  .

entrants like sony/pentax are good , but lenses  .

if you add an 18    200 vr nikkor , you do not have to worry much about dust vibration  .

nikon is definately putting out good product these days .

well , 1st things 1st  .

how does she feel holding her  .

great  .

the d80 has a real solid feel to her  .

it's not like the d200 , which i think is heavy , so i prefer the lightness it offers  .

i hate boat anchors  .

the responsiveness is impressive from the second you turn it on and start playing  .

the camera is quick  .

pictures  .

great  .

they really look good , balanced and well saturated  .

also , keep in mind that you can change these settings in the custom menu  .

the screen is a dream and the flash works well  .

i have an sb    800 , and the camera can control it as a slave , no need to use an 800 as a master as the d80 does it  .

ohh flash sync  .

well , if you use the right nikon speedlight the camera/flash combo lets you sync at the full shutter range so up to 1/4000th  .

don't buy an aftermaket flash the nikon works that much better  .

an sb600 is reasonable and a great flash unit  .

what else i like the sd card slot  .

i had an issue where i bent the pins inside a camera with a cf card  .

no prob  .

here  .

also , the sd slot supports the 'new' sdhd standard basically , up to 32 gigs on a card  .

however , the largest i've seen is 8gb  .

i guess you can tell by now i really like the camera i've used the canon 10d and 20d  .

all great cameras , but i like this one more it just moves  .

the camera can also edit pictures and remove 'red eye' and do other things automatically  .

nice features what i do not like is the simple stuff the nikon software is poor and i have to spend $150 or so for 'better' software  .

i'm trying to shoot raw but nikon makes that difficult as the support is not yet avalable in adobe or bibble labs however , that's soon to come  .

i wish the camera had some environmental seals for rain  .

that's really it  .

it's a great camera that should last for years  .

it's a winner .

first step to a digital slr from compact digital cameras and i must say i am very impressed  .

i researched for while and decided to wait for the d80 and i am not dissapointed i coupled the camera to the magic nikon 18    200mmvr lens and the images so far have been outstanding  .

this lens is worth every dollar and well worth the wait , as a matter of fact i recieved the lens before the camera the camera is extremley easy to use and very intuitive i have only had the camera a week or so but i can tell already that as i become more familar with it the pictures will only get better  .

my first digital camera is the d70s , i bought it a year ago and have a few thousand shots on it , but i is a little dissapointed by the 6  .

1 megapixel  .

but then comes the d80 with almost everything i loved about the d70s and at 10  .

2 megapixel how could i say no  .

i have had it for 2 days and am extatic to see that it simulates iso 100 whereas my d70s only did iso 200  .

it's extremely powerful and with that new func  .

button and all those d200 features i am in love with this thing  .

my d70s has just become a backup .

i have been waiting for several years to buy my first dslr , and this is the camera that i is waiting for  .

having had 2 35mm slrs , i knew what i is looking for , but no dslr to date had it all  .

the d80 does  .

combining the size and quality with the kit lens and then the price is what led me to make my decision  .

that , and the fact that it takes about 4x the number of shots per charge than the canon 400d , made it a dealbreaker .

taking photos as part of my profession (medical) for over twenty five years i can assure this is one of the best cameras i have ever owned  .

nikon optics are without question among the worlds best and nikon has a slr digital camera to match at a reasonable price  .

the only draw back is the size when taking family photos , but on the other hand it is lightning fast       no more missed shots .

he comprado para mi trabajo profesional dos camaras d80 al aï¿½o presento err  .

se envio al taller autorizado y al mes de reparada presento el mismo problema , no obstante la segunda camara al aï¿½o presento el mismo problema que hacer  .

updated  .

on sep 12 , 2008  .

this is my second magellan  .

first one (4040) has been stolen so i bought this one from costco for me it has some advantages over garmin    .

much louder voice  .

i used to have garmin and on speed over 60 i couldn't hear it (my car is pretty noise one ( pilot )  .

split view  .

it very helpfull when you take exit on freeway  .

garmin told me south or north for example , when it is too late to change line with split view you see exactly where you need to go 3  .

bing when you need to make turn  .

very helpfull feature cons   it slow to recalculate ; if for some reason you didn't follow it directions it takes 20    30 sec to recalculate also pretty buggy software however , in case with my late 4040 , magellan has released 2 updates and it fixed a lot of bugs  .

4250 already has update to fix some bugs , hopefully they release more in worst case i bought it from costco gps do not have 90 return policy  .

i have bought this camera as a first buy in the world of digital slrs  .

of course i have not been able to get the same performance as compared to film cameras but that is not practical as well  .

shooting in sunlight is fun but things are bad when it comes to shooting in low light  .

also the 3 frames per second claim is not convincing  .

overall i would like to say that it is a good buy for novices and professionals would find it average as per the investment is concerned .

i have used nikon cameras since 1994 (n90 , n70 , f    100 , coolpix 990)  .

i have had the d80 body (i use a 24    120 nikon lens) a week and a half and took over 100 pix outdoors and indoors  .

i am very pleased  .

but i have to follow ken rockwell's advice and use    0  .

7 exposure compensation , or more , for daylight outdoor photos due to metering problems (nikon needs to fix this  .

as an advanced amateur i have almost all the controls and options i would ever need with the d80  .

i'm sure that the d40 and d40x would have been cheaper and great too , but the d80 is fully compatible with my nikon lenses and the others are not .

i got this camera from costco few days ago it came with 18    55mm and 55    200 lenses i had been taking pictures with the camera that is in my sony camcorder and always wanted to own a dslr and finally got it i am not an expert but very much interested in learning about photography using these camera here are some questions i have    .

what else do i need to buy apart from the 2 lenses  .

i will be using this camera mostly for family , friends etc i see there are filters , wide angle lenses and so many other accessories 2  .

how to decide of when to use the 18    55mm or 55    200mm lenses 3  .

also when i am taking pictures under night potrait mode i am getting the images blur/shaky  .

i even tried to take using table for support  .

do i need a tripod in this case or do i use the manual mode setup thanks for you help if possible please send answers to my email id   kandadi@yahoo  .

com  .

great camera with nice automatic and advanced features .

takes good pictures , easy to adjust levels and settings , easy to correct picture on the camera , but if you need more elaborate work on picture the software does not give you a good tool to work with pictures overall good camera for the price i is expecting canon will give us a good software to go along with the quality if the camera  .

i have always shot with cannon's my oldest son who has a degree in in photo journalism he shoot's with a nikon  .

he has done some great work , he works with the d70 i've been waiting to see what nikon would bring out next i like that the lcd screen is gone from 2 to 2  .

5 i wish they could have kept the speed that the 70 had but sometimes you have to give a little to get alot .

i will add the d80 body to my present set of lens for the d70 .

if you cannot get this for $200 less than the d90 , then just go for the d90  .

if you can get this for $100 less than the d90 and the $100 is really important to you , like really important , then just get this camera  .

good camera , great pictures , you'll love it  .

are there advantages to the d90  .

yes but those advantages are valued user    by    user  .

definitely would not trash this camera really great build by nikon .

this camera is great 1 year ago but it sits in an odd space today  .

if you want a quick and convenient traveling slr look at the d40/d40x if you want a more professional camera go to the next models up the line .

functionality is great durability is poor  .

i have been involved is dslr photography for many years and shoot part time  .

here is my take on why you should not buy a d80    .

i would assume that most people who are looking at the d80 are probably entry level shooters  .

i own a d80 , but i recently used the bought the excellent d40 and would completely recommend the d40 over the d80 why would i recommend nikons entry level dslr over the d80  .

; a camera that would appear more advanced  .

read on firstly , the d40 uses exactly the same sensor as the d80  .

same technology for almost half the price the d40 is much more sensitive to light because it defaults to iso 200 unlike the d80 d40x which default to iso 100  .

this makes for sharper images  .

even the overpriced d40x cannot compete with the d40 because of it's sensitivity to light (the most important part of photography) the d40 flash sync speed (ask any pro photographer how important this is) is 1/500 second whereas the d80 is 1/250 second (may not sound like much , but it makes huge difference when shooting with a flash)  .

worried about 6 megapixels versus higher  .

don't be sold on the camera manufacturers claims that bigger is better when it comes to mp's  .

large megapixel sizes don't mean a thing  .

megapixel size is targeted towards the average uninformed consumer and is a way for corporations to get people to upgrade to newer cameras  .

unless you are shooting large poster size prints you don't need anything bigger than 6mp's  .

at 6 mp's you can makes great prints up to 12 x 18 inches  .

personally i have never printed anything bigger than that the flash on the d40 is the same as the d80  .

if you want to create great indoor photo's , i recommend buying the sb400 speedlight for the bounce feature  .

bounce flash is the holy grail of indoor flash photography because direct flash ruins photo's and washes out the colors the lens on the d40 (18    55mm) is a jewell of a lens  .

it is one of the best nikon lenses i have used (i have some expensive lenses)  .

it also weighs next to nothing so along with the camera , it makes for a very comfortable carrying experience  .

my d40 + lense weighs the same as my d80 body with no lens  .

other dslr's i have owned become tiresome because they are so big and heavy  .

the d40 is really a joy to use ; hard to explain but one in your hands and you will understand  .

it just feels so comfortable in your hands  .

the lcd on the d40 is so sharp and clear (same lcd as d80) , only the d300 is better some of the more technical aspects the d40 offers are full rgb histogram (through the well hidden color balance option) , full auto iso (it really works , you can even shoot at 3200  .

) , 3 point auto focus (3 is enough , don't buy into the hype of needing more) , battery life is excellent (i have gotten over 1 , 000 shots off one charge) most importantly , you can get fantastic colors using the saturation feature in the menu options  .

colors are vibrant using this along with the color iii mode bottom line , the d40 will take as good if not better quality photo's than the d80  .

i don't even use my d80 anymore since the d40 takes great photo's and is so light to carry around i would purchase a d40 vs a d80 (next step up is really the pro d300) any day of the week  .

the extra money you save can be spent on the excellent sb400 speedlight flash and the excellent nikor 18    200mm vr ii zoom lens  .

at the end of the day , remember having a more expensive camera will not make any better shots than a cheap camera (google photo's people have taken on camera phones if you don't believe it) you can pick up the d40's now for about $479 , lens included with shipping  .

just make sure you visit www  .

resellerratings  .

com and research the company you are purchasing from  .

there are a lot of scam sites out there  .

i buy most of my camera equipment from buydig  .

com and beachcamera  .

com (no i do not work for them) hope that helps .

does not have the feel that a professional camera should posses  .

cannot synchronize flash at speeds higher than 200 , that is not good for fill flash when shooting outside in sunlight also flash card dose not hold enough memory i believe the nikon d70's is a much better buy for the money i would not recommend this camera to the professional shooter .

i have been disappointed in the performance of my new d80  .

first the l  .

viewfinder is not bright enough to be visible in bright sunlight and it is not adjustable  .

secondly it is slower to focus no matter the setting or lens used  .

most annoying is its slow rate of actually taking pictures  .

it is nowhere near the advertised rate of 3fps  .

the manual actually says that you can get up to 3fps if you do not use the autofocus feature  .

why would i spend $1000 for an auto focus camera that i cannot use in the autofocus mode if i need to snap off picture quickly which i do as i phtograph fast moving trains  .

also the 18    135 lens it came with is mediocre at best but i can live with that as i have many of the older af nikkor lenses  .

what i am very displeased with is the dim l  .

, the slow autofocus and the slow frames per second  .

i do not have these problems with the d70s or the d50  .

thery are excellent cameras and a good buy  .

is it possible that my individual camera has problems or are these problems with other d80'  .

i would very much appreciate it if others who have this camera might report their experience with the three glitches i mentioned .

i love nikon products , do not get me wrong but personally i think that the d80 sucks  .

i have a constant issue of the f    stop flashing f       and i can not take pictures until i make the problem go away , which usually requires me to remove the lens from the body and then reattach it  .

the problem seems to resurface again and again every several uses and the problem seems to worsen the longer i have the camera  .

i have had two d80's since june of '08 due to this issue and the second one had this problem the minute i pulled it out of the box  .

i attended a local nikon school this weekend i made a point to ask about this issue and even a nikon technician told me he did not know what is wrong and that i would have to exchange it  .

immediately upon me asking , many fellow photographers that overheard my conversation joined in saying that their d80's did the same exact thing  .

bottom line  .

do not buy the d80  .

i myself am going tomorrow to exchange mine for a much better and less defective d90 .

i purchased this camera for action photos but works terrible indoors  .

very difficult to adjust to indoor lighting or dark settings  .

if you want to take good pictures carry a spot light all the time or a tripod  .

i hate it i missed out on good kid photos  .

i could have bought a cheaper camera and get better photos .

in an effort to maximize its profits , nikon sells the same product at different prices around the world  .

low priced versions of the product are plentiful in the us and when unbeknownst to me i purchased an international product , nikon told me that they wouldn't even stand behind their own product  .

no warranty  .

no firmware updates  .

no software updates  .

no support  .

and they blamed me but wait , there's more  .

i called nikon prior to purchasing  .

i visited their website and no where did it say , nor did anyone tell me to beware of international product  .

to this day the website does not even notify customers that you must buy from an authorized reseller i've always thought of a nikon as a top notch brand , but despite the fact that the problem is their own making , they choose to blame the company  .

take my advice and buy from a customer friendly company like canon .
