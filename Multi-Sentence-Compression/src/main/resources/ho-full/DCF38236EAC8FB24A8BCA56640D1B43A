our room was clean and appears to have been recently decorated but very basic , the bed was huge and the linen was fantastic .
the ensuite was clean but let down by exceptionally poor pressure for the shower .
in addition , most loos have masherator type systems so strange noises must be tolerated .
the staff were friendly and helpful ( very kindly allowed us in 2 hours early to change for a wedding ) but the reception was unmanned on arrival with a notice saying ask at the attached cafe if unattended - the queue at the cafe was ten people deep with one person serving !
luckily a cleaner appeared after 10 minutes and let us into our room .
like most hotels , the dedicated parking is very limited and appears not to be controlled .
24 hour parking in the adjacent habour car park was about £8 .
to their credit , the manager did offer to help out with this cost but as it was about a quarter of what we paid recently to park at a brighton hotel recently we did not take up the offer .
the hotel decor was undergoing refurbishment during our visit but they have a long way to go - the stairs carpet was in quite poor condition and holed in places .
this a basic hotel , not up to your premier inn or great western standard but it was clean and comfortable .
it appears to be used a lot by . . .

it appears to be used a lot by divers so is a bit more industrial then family orientated.
