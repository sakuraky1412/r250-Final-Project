this is our main unit in the family room  .
the video quality blew me away  .
i would call it wonderful  .
i read that some older units had audio sync issues , meaning the sound had a delay and did not match the lips of the speaker and lg had to upgrade it with a firmware  .
not the unit that i bought  .
the case should be closed  .
plus , whoever bought the unit should have a home theater with a decent sound system  .
i can  .
t imaging people spent over a thousand to buy a hd tv and keep complaining about sound quality  .
hd tv should match a surround sound system , not a native speaker  .
this is the first lg electronic unit  .
i have just found lg makes high devices with affordable price  .
i went on and bought a lg blue    ray player , very happy about them both  .
i am going to write a good review for the blue    ray later  .
the only thing that i am not happy is that days after i bought the unit the prices started to drop a bit  .
other than that , no complaints updated  .
on may 26 , 2010  .
you wo not beat this tv for the money  .
even may higher priced tv's cannot compete with this  .
overall a very high quality addition to any home .
i would recommend this tv to anyone  .
it took me a long time to get this tv i had to deal with best buy and it is crazy i first started off with the sony 46inch w series and it is defective , then i got another one and it is defective so i is talked into buying the a samsung and i could not stand the glare on the tv at all  .
so they gave me a 52 inch v5100 for free  .
i had that tv for about 3 weeks and it just is not the picture i is looking for  .
i brought it back and they swapped it out for this tv for free  .
i am in love with this tv especially since i only payed $950 for it   )  .
the first sony i bought is the ps3 package deal and that is only $950 muahahah  .
i love it  .
picture is outstanding for gaming , movies , tv , etc  .
the led backlighting with local dimming rocks  .
great value  .
i is buying samsung led until i saw this deal late october .
every thing from the the appearence to the functionality to the audio and picture quality and the freedom to choose from an extensive list picture and audio presets/setting and can adjust it according to my convienience .
my components are as follows    .
55 lh90  .
lg bd390 blu    ray player  .
cox motorola hddvr set top box  .
pioneer a1019ah    k receiver  .
first let me say that i really wanted a plasma but did not want to deal with break    ins and burn    ins  .
most of my tv watching centers around financial , news , and sports channels that have tickers strolling continuously therefore i thought it best to purchase the best lcd on the market  .
mission accomplished i wanted to install the components without the receiver just to see if i would experience the lip sync problems that are associated with the set  .
utilizing the hdmi connections i connected the cable box and the bd 390 directly to the tv but did not experience the lip sync problem with either  .
the picture is outstanding and i is extremely pleased with the tv  .
even the netflix streamed movies and youtube playback over a wireless connection (via the bd 390) is flawless  .
then i broke down the connections and reinstalled everything through the receiver  .
same results  .
therefore i can honestly say that the tv is everything that i hoped it would be  .
by the way i is able to program the pioneer remote to control everything including all of the functions of each component  .
this is a pleasant surprise  .
i must admit that at this moment i am one happy camper  .
the picture on this tv is outstanding .
i went through 4 hdtvs before getting this one  .
i knew i wanted 1080p and 240 hz  .
i went to a local furniture store and got the sony 46z5100  .
when i got it home , i loved it , until the sun went down  .
in darker rooms , the backlight shines through and creates uneven colors and bright spots in darker display scenes  .
i got online and found out this is a common problem with the sony lcds i took it back and the sales rep talked me into a toshiba 1080p , 240hz tv  .
junk  .
i hated it  .
it is too bright and the colors were saturated  .
i took it back and decided to go to bb when i first went into bb my eyes were drawn to this lg , but the sales guy talked me into the samsung 850  .
i took the samsung home and it kept powering off every 2 hours  .
i took the samsung back to swap it out and another sales guy said , oh yeah , we have that proble with these samsungs  .
so i went and spoke to the first bb sales guy and he told me to get the sony 46zx5100 again  .
he swore that i wouldn't have the backlight issue again  .
so , like and idiot , i got another sony  .
sure enough , i is getting the blotchy flashlighting effect  .
so i took it back and told them that i want the tv i is drawn to in the first place  .
before i took the last sony back , i kept it for a week and did research on the lg  .
i even took my xbox 360 into the store and hooked it up to the store model  .
i loved it in the store  .
the 240hz , although not true 240hz , looked just as good as the sony  .
the thing i loved is the colors of the lg and the local dimming  .
b    e    a utiful  .
better color than the sony , the samsung , and the toshiba combined  .
no joke the only concern i had from the reviews is the sound sync issue  .
i called lg before getting the tv and they said that it is a known issue and if i got one that had the problem , then i can call them and they will send me an update for free or i can download it from the internet and flash drive it to the tv  .
so far , i have not had to do this obviously , i am very picky  .
i love this tv  .
i got it for $1399 on sale and in my opinion , that is a steal  .
lg continues to pump out quality products and this is the latest and greatest  .
i rated the sound high because it blows all 4 of the other tvs out of the water  .
yeah , its perfect , but it rocks compared to the others  .
it's also led so it uses less ower than my electric toothbrush  .
i narrowed my search down to 2 tvs that were sitting side by side in bb  .
one is a samsung led (i am not sure of the model now , but it is on sale for about $1700) and the lg 47lh90 (currently on sale for $1500)  .
in the store both sets looked great , but i probably would have chose the samsung except that it did not have as many input ports / methods as the lg  .
i have a few older tivos which the samsung could not handle  .
it also would be nice to occasionally connect a still or video camera  .
no can do with the samsung so i zeroed in on the lg and researched it on the net  .
reviews were mostly positive with the exception of the audio sync problem  .
i almost gave up on the lg after tying to understand by the problem reading various success and failure stories  .
i went to lg's website to see if any official info is available on the problem  .
i found nothing there , but i did find their phone number  .
i figured it cannot hurt to just ask them about it  .
i talked to a customer service rep there and explained my concerns about buying a tv with audio    sync problems  .
she acknowledged that there is indeed an issue with this set when used in conjunction with some cable boxes  .
they said that the problem has been fixed  .
i asked how i could tell if i is purchasing a set that had the fix in it  .
they said that i could not  .
but if i did have a problem , all i had to do is call them and the fix would be sent free of charge  .
i is concerned if the problem affected hd tivos which used cable cards and they said no  .
i asked again if there is any way to identify whether a tv had the firmware update by displaying the firmware version and again she said no  .
(i found that hard to believe  .
but , i think they gave me the piece of mind i needed to just go ahead and buy the set tomorrow please disregard my 5 star rating as i do not own the set yet  .
probably not fair for the total rating averages , but giving it anything less might also be unfair hope this helps  .
maybe other people can call lg too and confirm my story .
its really worth , i bought it on 09/09/09  .
in this time i watch the sports us open , nfl etc and also watch matrix reloaded movie all are in hd (on the air) , i have only basic cable connection)  .
it is really stunning experience with natural skin tone , natural grass green in the football , with deep black levels in the matrix movie etc  .
the sd channels are really good  .
i played a dvd movie in a non    branded dvd player , but still i didnot miss dvd clarity  .
i also tried laptop    tv with s    video to composite connection , even though the picture looks same as in the laptop  .
iam really satisfied alot  .
this is my second lcd , the first one is phillips lcd which i returned after 3 months of purchase  .
i strongly recommend this .
for $1699 at best buy , i do not see how one could go wrong with this tv  .
sure there is better out there but you are going to pay alot more  .
for me this tv at this price is great and performs as stated  .
i own a samsung 40 lcd and went back to purchase another larger samsung for my living room  .
after two days i returned the samsung led and went with the lg  .
it covered every fault i had with the samsung   poor black ; annoying led side lighting ; glare from any window on its beautiful glass screen and hard to (non techie) set up to get the best picture the lg set is not a pretty led like the samsung but the matte screen works to stop glare  .
it is not as thin , but it allows me to mount it on a tilt mount without worrying that i may break it if i pick the wrong bolt  .
the price drop did not hurt either  .
i have always been disappointed with the samsung's aspect ratio choices (remember i own a 40 ) especially if you go from hd to non hd channels  .
this lg set gives me more choices and i now have a great picture that fills the screen and does not cut off the sides or game scores for both hd and non hd programs  .
the setup is a breeze with the picture wizard    it provides test pictures and you simply move the settings until it matches the picture based on your room conditions  .
never had a clue as to how to white balance before now i am god sound quality from the tv speakers is ok , and it does provide treble and bass adjustments , as well as thx sound and something called clear voice that improves the verbal over the background sounds  .
i lived with it for a week before my new home theatre system came in and it is fine  .
have not had any issues with lip sync  .
which is voiced as a concern for lg sets  .
hd and blue ray is life like and this set does a great job with non hd pictures  .
so if you can find this tv on sale and do not need pip or internet (which is still too clumsy to do on tv's) , then go for it .
agree with the most recent review and responded to his comments .
bottom line is this tv is well    worth the price tag  .
the picture and adjustments will leave you very satisfied  .
i picked up this tv at costco for a very significant savings .
only a samsung un55b7000 rivaled this lg model ; at nearly double the price too  .
lg is really coming on fast , imo ,  .
threatening sony and samsung the companies that get mucho dinero just for their names .
overall it is a great led hdtv .
this television is amazing in terms of picture  .
it's just beautiful  .
turn dejudder off  .
it will annoy you    everything looks like home handicam footage and you cannot watch a minute of a movie without it really getting on your nerves    there's no blur issue with it off  .
dejudder is an evil across the flat panel world , so it's hard to blame anyone for having it , but the default should be off    you can set it to off (from the default low ) under the picture setting in the menu now for the lip sync problem  .
this is a problem that you'll see when you use an hdmi cable from at least certain hd cable boxes  .
mine is a motorola dcx3000 from comcast  .
the sync problem is pronounced  .
it is less so with the component cables but there a bit  .
the fix for this is to go into your cable box settings    for my dvr this is done by keeping the tv on , powering off the box with the button and then hitting menu on the box or remote  .
i then go into other hdmi settings (or something like that) and under audio    switch it from auto or dolby or pass through to pcm audio    this is called l    pcm on my box and that will fix the audio sync problem the other way to address it is to use a receiver / external speakers for your audio  .
if you call lg , they will ask you a bunch of questions and tell you that someone is going to call you to set up an appointment to come with a firmware upgrade and make adjustments that might fix it  .
fine , but in the meantime you're getting gray hairs  .
i came across the pcm audio setting fix on a message board and after using it i wanted to post it here so that others could benefit from it by the way , if you have the same hd dvr as i noted above , i found the manual in pdf on    line with a quick google search updated  .
on dec 14 , 2009  .
i bought this tv and a new ultimate performance thx monster ( i know , i know , i got ripped off) hdmi cable because the monster box said it would be good for 240hz refresh rate  .
do i know if it makes the tv look any better  .
but i look at the hd movies i am watching on cable like the dark knight and i can barely breath  .
i am watching the yanks beat up on the phillies and the 240 hz seems seamless  .
football games look great as well  .
is it possible that the reviews on cnet and users are done with an outdated cable for the specs this tv has  .
i do not know , but sports and action movies are a thing of beauty i have set the calibration as specified by cnet and it looks appreciably better than thx setting which is too dark and drab  .
the only difference is i set the noise reduction level to low instead of off and upped the backlight and brightness a little bit because of the bright room it will be kept in i simply cannot imagine how anyone but the most die    hard videophile would be disappointed with this tv good job lg  .
sound   i originally bought the samsung led 8000 because of some of the negative reviews i have seen about the lh90 , specifically concerning lip sync issues  .
i found out that the 8000 had those issues as well so i exchanged it for the lh90  .
i found that the lip sync is much better with the lh90  .
i called lg and said that there is a little lip sync issue and they mailed me a usb memory stick with an upgrade of the firmware  .
fixed it perfectly picture   in the store the samsung 8000 looked better  .
now that i have had both , the lh90 is much better  .
the colors are very true and the back light is much more consistent with the lg  .
a huge plus is that the lg has a matte finish to its screen and does not reflect light if you are looking at the samsung led and the lg , go with the lg  .
the sound has been fixed and the picture is better .
so i did not save the $40 and buy anything but the best available hdmi cables currently available  .
monster 1000s and the sat service tech comment that he thought it is the best picture he had seen yet  .
is he blowing smoke  .
dunno  .
but it seems as if it is better then any hd set i have seen so far sure i will learn more about this tv and the possible settings but the initial set up is pretty easy , it's just that nosing around the menu i came across more options then i even have a clue as yot as to what they do or if i will even find a need to try them out  .
option for option this set will be bringing the competitions prices down , 47 full hd 1080p full led backlighting 240hz lcd tv all of which is more then intended to bring home with me , along with the total investment being more as well  .
but the lat set lasted near ten years so if this last near that long it will end up being well worth every cent .
i bought this tv partly because of cnet's review , but ran into the 'leaning' problem lg is talking about fixing this one , if they can , but say they wo not replace it even though it's under warrantee .
very nice tv  .
best picture i've seen  .
the audio delay can be bypassed by using an external sound system so it's not an issue with most but still troublesome to know it exists  .
lg says it can be fixed and i am still waiting .
i have this set hung on the wall above the fireplace ~ 8 feet off the ground  .
it is tilted slightly downward and the room is quite bright as i have 14 ft tall windows 90 degrees from the set  .
screen performs well in these conditions during the day  .
however , at night the off angle viewing is not good  .
the screen begins to take on a grayish hue and blooming is readily apparent  .
it is great if you are seated directly perpendicular to the screen , but start to deviate laterally and its performance suffers  .
i have noticed that if i stand on a chair off angle , the image distortion is less noticeable  .
i do not understand this phenomenon because the set is tilted downward to optimize the viewing angle  .
the room is quite large (20 ft x 20 ft) so most of the viewing spots are ~13 away which minimizes the amount one has to tilt one's head upward for viewing  .
i am seriously considering the sony xbr9 series which appears to suffer less from off angle viewing demons  .
it sounds as if the led sets are all displaying this off angle viewing concern .
i have only had this set for little over a week  .
i really like it but the lip sync thing unless fixed will have me exchanging it for something different  .
i will update the review in the near future .
bottom line , the picture is great , but the audio issues are criminal  .
lg is very aware of this problem and is working on a firmware solution (could be 3 or 4 more months as of 9/14/2009) that is not guaranteed to fix the issue  .
they realize that there are a lot of sets out there with this problem but have no recall or solution  .
the lg customer service rep advised that i try to return it to the store before my 30 days are up since they have no set date for the firmware update  .
great , now i have to dismantle and pack up this monster to take it back  .
it seem ridiculous that they have not recalled this product given the number of affected sets  .
it's a shame really , the set has a great picture at a very good price point  .
picture gets 5 stars , but the audio is a big 0 .
i purchased this television over the labor day weekend after reading the reviews  .
i'm using hdmi cables from my verizon fios to tv and i am experiencing lip sync issuers  .
i have had verizon reset my cable box and that did not work  .
i telephoned lg and they walked me through a television reset  .
i spoke with best buy and they showed me how to reset my lip sync setting back to 0  .
none of these worked  .
stilling working on problem  .
updated  .
on sep 28 , 2009  .
as i did some research on line i came to find out this is not all that uncommon of an occurence  .
conveniently for lg it seems to break just after the expiration of their warranty  .
you would think for a tv that costs this much money that a software failure would not require a $500 fix .
got this set and is amazed at the improvement in picture quality compared with a 5 year old dlp  .
noticed straight away a minor lip syncing issue and a more bothersome ghosting effect when characters were moving rapidly  .
called bestbuy geek squad and is told this brand new set needed a firmware update  .
when the geek hooked up the set to perform this action the set died entirely  .
the geek said another function should have been performed and lg gave the wrong advice  .
reported this within 30 days of purchase and now cannot even get someone from bestbuy to discuss it with me , except for the girl who hung up on me  .
take message    bestbuy has not stood behind their sale and a new tv should not need a firmware update .
