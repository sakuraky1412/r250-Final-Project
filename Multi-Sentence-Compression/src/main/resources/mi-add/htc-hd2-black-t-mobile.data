the phone is easy to use has a huge screen its skinny and lightweight and another thing i love about it is its really easy to send messages  .
i couldnt ask for anything better for my first true smartphone that can handle the heat and run through it at the same time .
the screen size is large enough to be a realistic mobile office and media viewer it has all the features you can think of and several more besides it is stunningly good looking and feels great , and it is a very capable tool  .
all of it's features work properly  .
it is not lacking in the way many of the other comparable devices do  .
had issues with it freezing up constantly  .
i reformatted the sd card and added my music by syncing from windows media player on my home computer to the phone instead of just dragging them onto a folder on the sd card  .
once i did this , all of my issues were resolved and the phone operates flawlessly .
this maybe my last phone ever  .
i love my hd2 and would not trade it for any other phone  .
it has been very stable and fast , fast , fast  .
i had an iphone 3g and that is like an appetizer for the full    on smartphone experience that is hd2  .
there is an adjustment period of about a day to get used to htc's sense gui , but it is sweet  .
great integration with contacts and facebook  .
so many clever touches , like the multiple sliding unlockers that take you right to new texts , emails , etc  .
great phone , better than the iphone , do not let windows mobile haters keep you from checking it out updated  .
on jun 2 , 2010  .
the bottom line is this phone is worth it even though its battery life is not great it still has a wonderful system and a great display .
after three years of blackberry devices , most recently the bold 9700 , i decided to try this device because of the screen and the fast processor  .
i honestly thought i would send it back after the trial period due to the lack of a keyboard and due to my love of blackberries then i got it in the mail  .
the screen is impossible to describe to you    everyone who sees it wants it  .
the form factor is not too big , and it is thin  .
the processor is blazing fast  .
the phone can even be used as a wifi hotspot for multiple devices    and it is fast too the windows mobile os is highly customizable    which i love  .
i can make the phone behave very differently with minimal effort  .
b n nook reader ; blockbuster video rentals ; blazing fast web browser ; music ; movies ; oh , and a great phone too one of the essential things for me is that this device had to sync my two g    mail accounts and the calendar on one of them  .
if it did not , then i would not be able to use it for work  .
well it does  .
the calendar even syncs faster than on my blackberry this phone has been a wonder for me  .
one lasst reminder , you do have to perform minor maintenance on it (ramclear ; task manager) every so often to keep it with its best performance .
you cant beat this phone  .
by far the best phone created out there .
the four os out there for smartphone are ; blackberry , android , iphone and windows mobile  .
i have tried them all and all on the right device work great  .
i think for some time windows mobile is running dead last  .
the new entry into the race htc hd2 running windows mobile 6  .
5 is by far a great phone  .
i could be dead wrong but a lot of people like this phone and most more than the iphone  .
hd2 is a smooth piece of work and the design is great  .
this phone blows my old blackberry curve away  .
i feel that you have to give credit where credit is do  .
they my have laid some bombs in the past , but this project is a solid effort  .
way to go boyyyy  .
(htc hd2) rocks .
don't let people fool you , windows mobile is an incredible smartphone os , but if you think that the iphone is a smartphone , we're talking two totally different worlds  .
the iphone is the worlds best feature phone , but the lack of multitasking , productivity software , expansion options , and limited settings in the os do not make it a smartphone  .
it is still laughable , that windows mobile 10 years ago , has greater power and features than the iphone does today so , if you just want a gadget phone , this is not for you  .
however , if you truly do want a netbook replacement that fits in your pocket , you can get no better as for those who complain that the battery life is poor , i think they must have defective devices  .
for having such a tiny battery , my phone with heavy use all day long with exchange , internet , rdp , and web use , will still have 30    50% battery when i get home late at night  .
think that is bad  .
try that with your laptop sometime and tell me how long you can go  .
do not compare it with your old razr phone , they're not even in the same world also , i'm not sure how this phone can feel clunky  .
yes , it is big , but not in comparison to the screen  .
look at how much wasted space is on phones like the iphone and the droid  .
there is a lot where there could be a screen  .
this thing feels solid yet incredibly slim in your hand  .
the solid body is the best quality htc has put out to date .
amazing phone , no problems with it so far  .
as for the call quality talked about earlier , i don't notice any problems except when you first get it  .
you have to adjust the call volume while on a call to get it to your desired level  .
as for the hanging up and calling randomly , i have not run into that problem maybe other people just do not have the settings set on the phone so that when you put the phone to your ear , it blacks out (kind of like what the iphone does)  .
hope this helps anyone that has doubts about the phone .
if you want the best mophone out there today  .
get this one  .
it's awsome  .
and despite some reivews saying that it's too big  .
i expect they must be about 4 feet tall and have hands the size of a mouse .
oh , did i forget to mention that the hd2 will allow for dual boot  .
meaning you will be able to run windows mobile as well as android os's  .
it is a close battle but , the hd2 phone is officially better than the nexus one and the iphone 3gs  .
check out phonearena's official review  .
its some reading involved and a video at the end for the apple iphone vs htc hd2  .
i've played with both and although the nexus one and the iphone are absolutely great phones , i bought the htc hd2  .
the only disadvantage i the hd2 has out the box is that the windows mobile 6  .
5 market place has nowhere the amount of apps that the android market has  .
but , once again , you can load android on the hd2 so , problem solved  .
but , take windows mobile 6  .
5 and add htc sense and wa    lah you have a phone that does what android does  .
the hd2 it takes the best parts of every innovative cell phone ever created and combines then into one phone with a 4  .
3 inch touch screen  .
even if you cannot stand touch screens , you will appreciate the technology that went it the hd2  .
and to make it even better  .
you have the swype texting feature which is absolutely wonderful and a time saver , believe me    )  .
opera browser works much better that the ie browser  .
ummmm , there's more but , i do not want to  .
turn this summary into a 5 page article , lol  .
just try it for yourself and submit your own opinion  .
this is mine sorry google , the nexus one killer has arrived and as for apple , may your next  .
iphone be equal to or better than the htc hd2 think about it updated  .
on apr 18 , 2010  .
i love this phone because of its speed and the size of its screen  .
the swype makes texting easier than a full keyboard and lets face it  .
this phone looks hot  .
i am a t    mobile customer for life  .
not to mention they offer unlimited talk text and web for 79  .
unbelievable  .
they also offered it as a bogo on a contract plan ridiculous  .
yes  .
this is it  .
the best os on the best device  .
i have had the iphone since its first came out but not to mention i have also had my fair share with windows mobile phones  .
the htc hd2 is an excellent phone and i would highly recommened it  .
the phone is not that big its thinner than most blackberry's and a little longer than the iphone  .
i switched from the iphone to the htc hd2 no complaints here  .
updated  .
on apr 18 , 2010  .
the hd2 lives up the hype  .
it's fast , gorgeous , a joy to use , and attracts attention wherever it goes .
properly syncs with a pc running ms office create and edit ms word docs and excel spreadsheets excellent media player  .
it will run many of the 1000s windows mobile applications the replacement for the ipaq 4700hx  .
cons   the micro usb connector    why not the mini  .
the lack of a stylus for the more intricate stuff  .
no transcriber handwriting recognition  .
changing settings , and finding applications and enabling and disabling features is a bit cumbersome this is the device that i have been waiting for years to replace my ipaq hx4700 the screen size is large enough to be a realistic mobile office and media viewer it has all the features you can think of and several more besides it is stunningly good looking and feels great , and it is a very capable tool  .
all of it's features work properly  .
it is not lacking in the way many of the other comparable devices do  .
yes , it can be a bit of a long winded process to get the best out of the device , the operating system and menu screens could be more intuitive , particularly the options and settings screens , but it is all in there and although it can be hard to find at first , you get used to it pretty quickly my own experiences of it hardware ireviews s not so much finding out what it will do but more about what it won't do  .
so this is the list i've found , or at least not yet found the setting for    .
it wo not lie flat on it's back on a table top  .
the sharp edges of the camera lens protrudes and it wobbles and could scratch a polished surface most applications wont close and continue to run and hog memory unless you force them to close in the task manager it does not have an ir port  .
it does not have a front facing camera for video calling it seems not possible to reduce the screen touch sensitivity it can be a bit 'hair trigger' pinch to zoom seems only works with applications specifically written for that feature .

dont get android i have a hero so sick of it  .
all you hear is android and iphone  .
htc is a fresh new look get one if you can .
this phone is nothing short of amazing in every way  .
speaking from having tried out the various versions of the hd2 (non    us) , this one feels faster and smoother , comes with some amazing new apps , and has better specs  .
this is , by far , the greatest phone currently available  .
as long as you do not have tiny hands , it will be the best smartphone you have ever used , by far  .
get online and start getting some free apps from the many websites out there (xda developers , ppcgeeks , freewarepocketpc) .
i never thought i would say this but i love my windows mobile 6  .
5 hd2  .
i is going to buy the nexus one but i could not find it in any brick and mortar t    mobile stores  .
i is waiting until it came to the store but it never did  .
google's loss but my gain  .
go to your local t    mobile store and see for yourself , the hd2 is an awesome phone  .
little history , started with at t htc 8525 to verizon voyager to blackberry storm to blackberry tour  .
jumped to motorola droid , then hated verizon so tried t    mobile with the motorola cliq xt  .
i traded during my 14 day trial to the htc hd2 , and wow  .
ithas a sense ui that can act like android while it boasts a music player like the iphone  .
by far one of the best phones i have ever laid my hands on  .
if you are looking to upgrade go for it , super fast no lag operation loaded with everything under the sun including movies and blockbuster on demand  .
its fantastic  .
does have turn by turn navigation and server software to even help find and maintain gps satelites faster  .
not to mention one of the largest clearest displays around , making every task from work to fun easier and enjoyable  .
and with rumors showing that it will be available to upgrade to the windows 7 system os for free in q4 of 2010 whats your excuse now  .
the best phone ever  .
i would recommend it to all my business partners  .
great phone .
the hd2 is the best phone i have ever used , hands down  .
it beats the iphone hands down in terms of functionality , and is about on par with the droid there is one thing which is troubling me , however  .
the barnes and noble e    reader app supposedly comes with 3 free e    books , but i have not been able to find anything on b n or the hd2 website about the specifics of what kind of books are 'free' (price range , title range , etc)  .
they obviously aren't the already free e    books on b n  .
com , otherwise , they would not have bothered to mention the '3'  .
has anybody been able to download the more expensive e    books free  .
more light shed on this subject would be much appreciated  .
this is a very fast , business user phone  .
anyone trying to use this device like an iphone will be unhappy  .
i switched from at t and the iphone 3g to this device in may  .
i've been very pleased with the performance of the htc hd2 and tmobile's network  .
i haven't experienced one dropped call in 2 months  .
i have not experienced the freezing up problems but i'm using the task manager on a daily basis to close applications and power cycling the phone once a day  .
the battery life was not very good when i first received the phone but it's seemed to gotten better over time  .
with medium to heavy use i can make it an entire day before i need to charge the phone  .
that's not bad for a smartphone .
this is the best phone i have used so far  .
the trick with this phone is to put a custom rom on it  .
basically that means remove the stock software and put one that has been improved upon  .
right now i am using core cell series from xda developers and its amazing  .
the processor is soo fast and the phone works flawlessly  .
i really dont think this phone is for people who arent tech friendly  .
word of advice if you know how to use your pc without going to geek squad at best buy for installing anti virus software then you should be able to customize this phone and put new rom  .
go to xda developers they are life savers .
this phone is the best phone out there  .
i traded in my mytouch 3g for this phone  .
this phone has everything im looking for  .
the only disadvantage is the battery life  .
im determined to go out and buy another battery for me to carry around , but other than that i recommend this phone to anybody who wants a high tech phone .
bottom line , all the skeptical people of a windows mobile phone , give it a try  .
i come from having an android 1  .
5 system to this and i would say for me this phone is more intuitive and meets my expectations  .
in a phone i look for email friendliness , customization , user friendly (navigation in the phone) , call quality , simplicity , battery    life , screen display , call and end buttons , camera w/ flash , etc  .
with all that said , if these are areas you are looking for , i recommend this phone  .
the only thing for me that is really lacking is the marketplace  .
however , there are apps that meet my needs on a daily basis such as pois , bible , wifi router capability , clean ram utilities , etc updated  .
on jun 26 , 2010  .
i think t    mobile and htc have something here  .
this phone does everything it's supposed to  .
i switched from android on my mytouch 3g (original) that locked up all the time and most of the apps forced closed to the hd2  .
i have gotten comfortable with the menu structure and design within 5 days of having it  .
there are some things that droid does but many that windows does better  .
there are so many little things that htc built into this phone that just make sense , like the proximity sensor , i have never seen a phone that shuts the screen off when it's close to your head , or switches to speakerphone if you set it down and flip it over  .
it's slightly bigger than the current iphone/droid phones but the difference is not really noticeable  .
if you are already carrying one of it's competitor's phones then the screen is definitely worth the size  .
it comes with a gel case , wired headset with media controls and mic built right in , power/sync cable (not that you need the sync cable for anything but syncing music/media to the device  .
it is really an elegant looking device and is very customizable  .
just like droid phones there are many hacks out there , that you can really take this phone as far as you are technically inclined to do  .
if you picked it up on t    mobile's all    phones , all    day , all    free sale you really got a deal  .
well worth the upgrade , way to go t    mobile/htc  .
finally a device i am happy with .
bottom line phone is good because i havent had a phone that had everything work  .
i is able to download all my personal and work emails  .
and i finally have a phone that can be a navigation tool as well (copilot live 8 is awesome)  .
i wish tmobile and htc would fix the freezing issues and wish htc came out with a 1800mah battery that uses the factory back plate but over all this phone has become my favorite compared to my 40+ phone i've owned in the pass 8 to 10 years even though i dont have 8+ mega pixels or hd quality video .
i currently am a t    mobile customer and owned a bb  .
t    mobile has descent phones , but nothing like verizon or att  .
i is thinking of switching but you cant beat t    mobile prices  .
and no , i don  .
t have a problem with coverage where i am  .
before i bought the phone i did some research about it  .
i read a lot about windows mobile , most of it is not good  .
ok 99% of it is not good  .
i said screw it and bought it anyways  .
out of the box it is an amazing phone  .
after a couple of days of playing with it i is almost ready to sell or return it  .
there is some customization but not a lot  .
make it my own  .
is what i wanted and it didn  .
t really deliver , out of the box  .
then i found xda    developers  .
these guys are the real deal and love wm , and i  .
m glad they do  .
if you buy this phone you will need to visit these guys  .
it will change your life  .
here is a link to help you out  .
http  //forum  .
xda    developers  .
com/showthread  .
php  .
t  688928 this link has some nice incite  .
thanks to member jdwrrzmm for posting it , you da man  .
it's a great phone  .
the only thing that pulls it down is the world's worst os  .
htc had made it an htc phone , not a windows phone  .
but when you hit one of those little bumps , it's windows , always windows  .
the hd2 should have been an android phone  .
we all know that  .
but i'll take it .
first of all let me start by saying i paid $100 for this device , and $100 to stop using my iphone as a phone  .
totally worth it  .
i have read reviews by people who gave this phone to a child , nice  .
the problems you might encounter with this phone have been widely discussed on this review board  .
i have hit most of them along the way  .
all of them are fixable , annoying , unnecessary , and microsofts fault  .
anyway , it took me a month to get it where i wanted it  .
most of its issues are carried over from when i used winmo 6  .
1 so shame on microsoft updated  .
on may 15 , 2010  .
i love this device for its versatility and power  .
windows mobile 6  .
5 enables it to integrate comfortably with a pc running windows os       you can even access the pc desktop from the phone  .
i can tether a laptop to the phone and use its data plan or even make the phone a wifi router that accepts multiple incoming connections  .
i can also run multiple application simultaneously , checking email or browse the internet , listening to streaming radio , synchronizing rss feed , and in between make a phone call , and check google map with live gps  .
to me , this is a wonderful pocket computer that makes the best use of my time pockets  .
if you do not mind paying for applications , this is the phone you want  .
this phone is a great phone  .
easily the best one i have owned  .
its added benefits of being expandable memory and removable battery make it a great foe of the iphone  .
i think in a little time the apps will come around and this phone will be a great addition  .
i highly recommend this phone to anyone despite the cons  .
really a great phone .
great phone get it i love it i finally got this phone after 4 years with my last one im sooo happy with it   )  .
do not listen to anyone about poor service due to phone going to edge  .
i live in hickville , alabama and get perfect service  .
phone is really great if you can get past the battery life and limited apps .
i would give this phone a 94  .
5 out of 100  .
just watch a movie and you will laugh at the iphone and nexus one's tiny screen .
this phone gets picked on for being big  .
but its not bigger than an iphone , but it has a larger screen and build in flash for the camera , higher resolution for the camera updated  .
on apr 3 , 2010  .
if you want the perfect internet phone this is it  .
if you want all the apps you can handle get a android or iphone  .
this phone is the perfect entertainment phone .
this phone reminds me of a computor  .
if you dont know how to use it what good is  .
it also it reminds of a auto  .
if you want carry 8 people you would buy a sports car  .
also like a computor if you open 10 screens you think your computor slow down  .
go to task manger close some of those screens  .
learn about the phone before you buy i wrong know what need before you buy  .
this phone does what i want and need and i have 30apps that i use most on my home screen and could put more  .
i had treo is 1st smart phone and the gave it back because the screen is too small  .
bought this phone in april and still learning  .
there are a lot free apps if you know where to go and purchase some nice one my fav most use spl3 time alarm unlimited alarms i am up to 25 alarms  .
i turn my wifi and blue thooth on and off from my home screen  .
the phone does what i want i can go on and on  .
do you notice they dont give books on the phones any more  .
from people comments some people blame the phone  .
i need to admit the phone is very senstive  .
but from reading other reviews i know this phone is the true mulititasker  .
true to your self what do you want your phone for and what do you want it to do this one does it and more  .
with a few tweaks and reading through guides and forums on how to fix things , this phone is running as well if not better than my friend's htc evo 4g  .
i am considering getting an extended battery and have already purchased a solar powered charger (car) and a battery powered portable charger for my backpack at school work  .
the phone is beautiful  .
android runs absolutely slick and i have no complaints  .
the kicker is this phone can be bought in relatively good condition on ebay for $200    $250 compared to the evo which run $400    $500 unless you want to sell your soul for 2 years and get it for less  .
this phone will not disappoint you i guarantee it  .
i would suggest getting an 8 or 16gb sd card just to be sure because the os takes up a decent amount of space .
price is ok $439 base price but the $79  .
99 t    mobile unlimited package is worth it if you buy the phone and not take the service plan  .
i cut my verizon monthly cost in half , basically getting the phone for free with 3 months savings  .
i do not have a problem with windows mobile 6  .
1 , so if you hate ms or windows , better stay away  .
cannot sync with google calendar yet , but i use outlook so it's ok for me and does that well on the hotsync activity .
i was not a touch screen guy until i got this phone  .
the phone reacts to every touch with ease  .
the keyboard also helps with navigating without touching the screen  .
the speaker is great for music but it is only on the back  .
if the phone is in your pocket or lying down on the speaker , you will barely hear the phone  .
the battery life is great , on idle time without doing anything it'll last up to 3 days  .
when you're talking , texting and using the web , it'll last for up to two days  .
camera takes good pictures but there is no flash  .
i wish the phone could've come with a regular headphone jack but thats what i have my zune for  .
overall good phone for playing around and professional office work  .
everyone has things to say about this phone mostly negative , but if you have had as many phones as i have in a short amount of time you get to know the pros and cons of these devices  .
i've had all major os , and models of phones out there for the last 3 years , im not talking about dropped calls , reception , or call quality because thats the provider im talking about u  .
speed , the bread and butter of a phone and this phone is one of the elite  .
htc sense is great , easily able to customize home screens and prefences  .
some people talk about lagging which i've exprineced with all phone the iphone , blackberry , my touch , and this phone gave me the least problems  .
windows altough is not the greatest os , has it's calling in the cell phone market , sync to windows base pc's which for many is wonderful  .
it's one of the fastest phones on the market with 1g of processing speed opens programs with no problems and muititask beautifully  .
im writing this after having the phone since it's launch , and it has not let me down  .
i've had android based os and they are great if your into social networking , and seems to me that there phones are geared as more fun phones , just my opinion  .
in terms of being a powerful phone this is a power house  .
it's kind of funny they love the unlocked version , with the same os because windows moblie 7 is not released yet but the regular versioin is terrible  .
did i mention that i get around a day and half of battery life with heavy usage , which is better than most  .
the camera is great takes great videos  .
there is alot you can say about this phone but it is in the top 5 phones on the market , not because it makes the best calls or the reception is great but because it's one of the most powerful phones on the market updated  .
on sep 28 , 2010  .
i had always wanted an iphone , but i did not think it is cost effective with att plans  .
so i finally got my touch screen , through tmobile  .
the windows os just makes sense  .
period .
it has a hug display loads of features and is the best for multimedia and a n edge over other phones  .
i'm in line  .
the bottom line is that if your service provider does not support 3g on this phone (at t for example) , the cons outweigh the pros  .
the iphone is a much better option for a at t user  .
this is not too say that this phone has some advantages over the iphone    .
camera takes crisper shots , videos seem smoother    ps1 emulator is great for old classics , and is easy to use    any app can be downloaded for free if you look in the right places + 3rd party app support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             .
internet    .
2g is terrible not to mention that it wastes a lot of battery life  .
since the phone doesn't turn of internet connections when it is locked (unlike the iphone/itouch) , it drains a lot of battery life in your pocket (3% an hour) , so you find yourself constantly turning it off  .
tethering (using the phones internet connection to send internet to your computer) through bluetooth is flawless , the only thing it lacks is speed (2g limitations) , it starts with a click of a button on your laptop , and it is very convenient                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             .

0) , this phone is not very friendly to the music listener  .
browsing the internet as well as watching videos is really all this phone is good at , and with 2g this is very limited  .
the native music player is terrible , and will only support up to 200 songs without insane amounts of lag  .
pocket music , and some others are awesome alternatives , however even they suffer from the speed of the connection between the memory card and the phone  .
if this phone taught me anything , it is that built in memory is the way to go , memory cards over 8gb aren't practical for listening to music  .
i also feel that the slow memory card writing/reading speed is also the reason for why sometimes video    recording lags , and creates 5 frames/videos , or skips                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             .
price    .
i bought this phone for $480 with a 16gb memory card new and unlocked when it came out , but paying $30/month for 2g internet (at t) is just not worth it  .
knowing that the iphone 4g is just around the corner i would have definitely reconsidered  .
for $180 cheaper , you get a phone that does not lag when you play music , has 32gb memory , has better app support , and better battery life .
the phone is unlike any other , it's huge and at the same time stunningly beautiful  .
it features a slim    profile despite the huge screen size and has a really good built quality , and the casing is really designed well  .
the snapdraggon processor will handle almost anything effortlessly , and htc sense really furnishes windows mobile os pleasantly  .
extras like the fm radio and flash are nice additions to and the camera it features takes excellent pictures for its class (5mp) the screen may not be suitable for everyone though , but it is pocketable  .
the windows marketplace which is like the app store for windows mobile os does not feature many quality apps and many have horrible user interfaces  .
basically expandability is limited another thing is it's settings are not set to full potential but it has a great mod community backing it up that help unlock hidden features like wireless n and make the device faster and such  .
it's really the aftermarket modifications that make this device special and it's wide support by the modding community  .
it is even capable of running android (most features work as of august 2010) but still testing to make sure .
i actually like the iphone , but hate at t  .
i really want htc and especially t    mobile to out do the giant  .
this phone is a great try , but it just didn't make the cut  .
i'm going to put the blame on microsoft not htc or t    mobile  .
i do love this phone because all the features are easy to use and using the internal router is definitely a plus  .
this phone is actually great  .
the main reason i got it is for office 2010  .
i can save documents from my computer to the phone , use it on the road or put it on any other computer and print it if i want  .
and like i said , the display is awesome  .
as phones are now less of a phone and more of a micro computer , the os needs to step it up  .
if windows does not come up with something spectacular by next summer , i'm going back to android .
this is a very good phone , certainly not the best though  .
there may never be a day when the perfect phone exists , but it has been the best i've ever had i got this phone for the easy linking between contacts , phone calls , appointments , messages and email  .
its great ; i have one contacts information all linked together and can easily access it with one touch  .
call quality is fantastic , email works well , calendar reminders haven''t been a problem but the text messages have had a few issues  .
the texting itself is fine , whether you use the full qwerty keyboard or swype  .
the only problem with the text messages is the delay if you dont delete your messages  .
i have mine set to organize message by send , so whenever i open that thread , it needs to load all the message , which can take awhile  .
if you consistently clean out your messages you should be fine all of the other features are great , havent had any problems  .
love the camera quality , panoramic mode is awesome  .
also like that you can instantly post pictures to mms , email and facebook right when you take the picture the battery life does suck  .
im ok with charging my phone everynight , but if there is ever a case when i couldnt charge for 2 days i would be screwed  .
i have heard of setting the mode on airplane mode when not using it to save battery life but i havent tried it overall great phone , one of the best out on the market  .
way better than the iphone  .
once you get use to it , youll enjoy it .
adding music and video is almost the same to an ipod  .
very helpful keep in touch with friends music and movies without having to be at home  .
this is a very nice phone and has a lot of cool features  .
the only 2 things that i dont like about the phone is that the battery dies very quickly and the reception really sucks  .
i like my iphone 3g a lot better then this phone .
in the past i have owned   htc shadow , htc dash , htc wing , htc touch2  .
all of these were  .
user friendly  .
and i set them up within 2 hours with favorites , music , etc now this beast , the htc hd2 is truly a huge beast  .
it took me 8 hours to set it up the way i wanted it and still not finished setting it up  .
yes , i am a geek and i know how to tweak , however , this beast will take at least 6  .
8 more hours of tweaking  .
it is a good thing that i love a challenge and don  .
t mind tweaking because if not , i would send it back  .
i am determined to grow from kind of liking this phone to almost loving this phone and wanting to use it all the time  .
so , i will be updating my review in a couple of weeks  .
my advice is that if you are not a geeker or a tweaker , stay away from this phone  .
to sum it up   i went from a htc touch2 (smaller and simpler smartphone , like a junior high phone ) to a huge and not simple htc hd2 (like a phd phone)  .
or to better explain , it is like i moved out of my small apartment (the htc touch2 with 500 square feet) to a luxary new home of 5 , 000 square feet  .
so this phone is 10 times harder to  .
set up  .
and  .
tweak  .
than any of my older htc phones  .
i bought this phone for one reason   the huge display  .
and the reason for my rating of 3  .
5 stars   i took off one star because the keyboard is hard to use and a half star because of hard to fine settings  .
one more thing , they moved the old media player to the file manager , in order to set up playlists on the media player , i had to go to file manager and then find my songs  .
then all ok  .
i is thinking this phone would be like my htc touch2 , only larger  .
wrong , it is nothing like the htc touch2 (a much easier phone to use and setup) updated  .
on may 15 , 2010  .
i found out that after i turned the sense ui off and put it on windows default , the phone performed a lot better  .
you do have to make sure you actually close programs , because the phone can get unresponsive if memory hungry programs are running in the background  .
its a pretty good messaging phone , but does not beat my ex blackberry  .
web browsing is nice whenever i can get a good 3g connection , which can be spotty  .
a small few fixes to the factory phone and everything's good  .
a lack of integrity , consideration , intention design ever  .
it's an wish wanna be smartphone .
it's down right sad that cnet never , ever blames the handset they're using on why 3g is constantly going down to edge  .
if you go and read every review they have    the comments on t    mobile's 3g network varies widely in the same city  .
the reason why is because the phone is also part to blame with how it deals with a less than strong or weak signal  .
the hd2 will drop 3g in a heartbeat just like htc's nexus one where other 3g phones won't of course have 4 bars , but will have 2 or 3 or even 1 bar of 3g  .
get it together cnet , i know they must observe which phones do and do not have good reception , but they rarely if ever note it in their reviews , they just blame the network  .
this goes for all handsets they review .
most apps pre    loaded require a subsription  .
there are some bugs with getting around in the menu screen  .
no adobe flash player etc  .
i is a blackberry user and really liike the feel of the blackberry o  .
with that said however , its nice to have a larger screen to actually use the phone as a legitimate browser  .
the trade off is its more cumbersome as a phone  .
hopefully there will be more apps for this phone coming soon  .
windows marketplace is very limited compared to the iphone apps .
though lacks some features that htc evo has , the best available windows mobole phone  .
it is definately better than iphone with the 1 gb qualcomm snapdragon processor and sufficiant ram/rom  .
the screen resolution is pretty good , watching youtube videos is more comfortable .
the phone itself is an amazing device  .
snappy fast and the sense ui and weather animation (all though neat but useless) is great  .
the swype keyboard option is neat and is very quick to get use to  .
the large display is both a positive and negative  .
when surfing the web , watching video or just reading that 4  .
3 inch display is amazing  .
but as in both my pro and con the large display is awkward to hold comfortably in the hand while talking on the phone  .
windows mobile 6  .
5 is not bad the sense ui really covers up the flaws people talk about with that platform and not being able to upgrade to windows phone 7 in the future is a drag  .
the processor allows you to quickly and easily slide between applications , the demo games were very nice on the large display  .
the phone did quickly integrate my contacts with facebook but i kept getting error after error after error while trying to sync on my computer using windows 7  .
the first day i had it i almost took it back for what ever reason i kept getting a ton of error messages while sending text messages to my wife and they were phone/windows mobile errors as it kept sending me to the do you want to send this error report to microsoft  .
and i got the same messages while trying to surf the web but after that first day i have not had another error in 3 days  .
i got it on it's release day and have had it for just a few days and i am afraid to say it is probably going back to the store  .
nothing on the phone but the network (t    mobile) does not do this phone any justice  .
i live just outside of nashville , tn and if you live in or around downtown nashville you get solid 3g coverage but where i work and live (20 miles south east of nashville) i only get edge service which just drags , my wife has a htc hero on sprint and we get nearly full 3g coverage with sprint and her phone will pull up web sites easily 3 times as fast as my hd2  .
i have a blackberry curve on sprint and is out of contract and i will probably keep my sprint coverage and wait for the nexus one to come to sprint  .
even with the evo 4g coming this summer the 4  .
3 inch display really is awkward to hold when using as a phone , it's almost too big for a phone  .
my dad uses an iphone and it's more comfortable in the hand  .
running on t    mobile stinks their network does this phone zero justice  .
on my wi    fi network it flat out flies , if i turn it off and switch to edge it drags and takes forever to pull up even the simplest of web pages  .
with a better network this phone would easily be a keeper but to pay $449 (i went with out a contract) for a top of the line phone you really need a better network to really justify this phone  .
now if you live in a city with great t    mobile 3g or their hspa roll out then i would keep it  .
t    mobile told me they will roll out hspa to my area some time in 2010 but they can' tell me when if i knew it would be soon i would keep it .
i switched from iphone 3g because the t    mobile plans are unlimited and more affordable  .
i is also tired of the at t network dropping calls and slow internet speeds this phone does everything i need it to and the service is great with t    mobile  .
phone quality is great and data speeds are amazing the usability is a disaster  .
i find i only use my phone for calls , reading emails , and listening to music  .
sending text messages and emails are very painful  .
the predictive text locks you until you select from the words it predicts over all i am looking into the google g2 , or looking to move back to iphone .
the tactile keyboard is very frustrating  .
my fingernails barely reach the end of my fingertips and even they are getting in the way while using the keyboard  .
who designed this  .
and for whom , a teenager with skinny fingers  .
in just the first 2 days , i have inadvertently sent 4 unfinished email messages as the outlook send button is right above where my left thumb rests  .
also , the delete key is just above the enter key  .
because i'm having so much trouble typing , i have to delete a lot of characters only sometimes i hit the return key instead and the text is accepted , but it's often incorrect (for example , a password)  .
this is very nerve wracking and i get very stressed while typing because it takes 5x longer to compose a message than on my blackberry (with a physical keyboard) , i'm afraid i'll send a message with lots of errors , or send to the wrong person i have tried copying a phone number from my outlook contacts to an email message and find that , while i can copy the number from the contact entry , this cannot be pasted into an email draft  .
i had to write down the number , then type it into the body of the message it's too easy to inadvertently dial from the call list    a short tap while scrolling through the list is enough to place a phone call to that entry i've had complaints that the call quality is not good when using the speakerphone the 30    page user manual provided with my t    mobile phone is way too general  .
i went online and found a manual which is 300 (small) pages and much more thorough i have to keep using this because it's my company phone , but i find it hard to imagine that i'll grow to like or trust the keyboard  .
and poor sound quality defeats the purpose of having a company phone in the first place .
good for taken picutres listenin to music and the preloaded entertainment please tmobile fix these issues  .
i loved the phone and the concept  .
it has a great screen , the phone is slim  .
the operating system kills it  .
70% of the times when i made a call i had to hit the sot reset button (when i is able to get to the app) or just pull the battery because the phone just would not hang up the call  .
the phone would bog down .
i really expected this phone to be great especially since i dished out serious money to get it  .
not living up to expectations  .
definitely not as cool as the commercials hype it up to be  .
probably would keep it if i was not having such trouble with my email o well mytouch slide is where its about to be at   )  .
my hope is that when windows 7 comes around , we (hd2 owners) will be able to upgrade to it  .
my hope is that win 7 will entice all those programmers to start writing code for it again  .
i will be willing even , to pay a nominal fee to be able to upgrade  .
updated  .
on jun 10 , 2010  .
i wish it was not running on windows mobile maybe then it would be better  .
until then ill put up with it and just have my fingers crossed htc will address these issues .
once it converts into a droit , it really will be unbeatable .
i purchased this phone for my daughter who initially loved it , after 2 weeks and half a dozen support calls we returned the phone and cancelled our service with t    mobile  .
those of you who are considering buying this phone think about it carefully , read the t    mobile forums before making the purchase .
move on and get the nexus one  .
come on tmobile , htc and microsoft you are on to something finally  .
fix the bugs  .
this phone has the potential to blow iphone and android phones out of the game  .
but i do not want to pay 500 dollars on a phone that randomly calls people and has a lot of static  .
maybe in a few months i will try again  .
had to take this one back  .
yes the iphone has a lot more apps  .
so does android  .
but this phone has way more potential  .
i have had the mda for years waiting for a decent phone  .
the touch pro 2 almost had me because i like real key boards  .
but it fell a little short of what i is looking for  .
got my daughter a new ipod touch  .
has fun apps and games  .
just not for me  .
too hard to type on and to proprietary  .
if you try to use more than one computer to get music or movies from , your out of luck  .
no flash on camera  .
just a toy compared to the potential of this phone  .
as far as the apps go , i do have to give props to apple for that  .
but with some apps coming out now , you will be able to run android apps on hd2 soon  .
already available for touch pro 2  .
so you can have microsoft office , a real pda that's not proprietary , add memory and battery without buying a new phone  .
and have microsoft and android apps on one phone  .
just fix the software and static noise on calls updated  .
on jul 17 , 2010  .
this phone has it's ups and downs for me  .
while i commend htc for keeping to microsoft roots , they really should not have with this phone or they should have at least waited until windows 7 comes out  .
microsoft could also take a page out of apple and google's book and make their software upgradeable  .
if they were supposed to make me fall in love with this phone , they fell short of my expectations  .
i do not mind the bulkiness of the phone but the integration between htc sense and windows 6  .
5 is the equivalent of putting a mustang engine in a ferrari  .
also the other bone i have to pick is why is it that the same phone is being developed for sprint but with android , better camera , and just a little bit thicker than the htc hd2  .
i will have to wait for the summer and see what the evo 4g can do  .
while i have a great disdain for sprint , the evo 4g might be the phone that changes my mind  .
my parents broke their necks to get the phone i decided i'll just wait in hope something better will come out  .
(they usually do)  .
i tried this phone for one week  .
i am an iphone owner and have tried different other phones like nokia n97 , xperia x1 , htc fuze  .
etc frankly iphone is still the number one the hd2 phone is best windows mobile phone in the market  .
but it is still a windows phone running win 6  .
5 not upgradable to win 7  .
in addition , t    mobile coverage sucks in my area so to me this is the main reason to return it to the store  .
the phone itself is nice and i like eveything in it , except the win 6  .
5 os  .
let's face it , win mobile looks very retarded to the shiny android or iphone interface if the win7 will not compensate for the outdated look and retarded performance of the win 6  .
5 , then there is no point of having the fanciest device  .
the software should match the hardware , and that is why the iphone wins  .
the amazing os of the iphone is unbeatable  .
do not get caught up in the hype about this phn its not cut out to be what it seems  .
the window has a long way to go and alot of improvement to catch up wit before it is able to compete with the android phones  .
sticking with the android market  .
my windows 7 computer did not recognize the device when i plugged it in  .
could not get it to sync with exchange even after importing the root certificate  .
i really did not want to spend a lot of time trying to get this thing to work  .
personally , i felt let down when it did not work out of the box in a windows environment  .
after reading on some forums i discovered that if you went into other settings and disabled faster connection over usb for active sync my computer recognized the device ; it still hung up when syncing  .
we are at a point in time when devices like this should natively work out of the box especially when using an os built by the same company  .
the hd2 took great pictures and the video work well and took advantage of the flash as well  .
anyway , i took it back to walmart ; cost $500 no contract price  .
hopefully , my experience will not be the norm because if things worked out of the box i would have loved to keep the device  .
yeah , i did have the hd2 ; walmart accidentally sold it too early .
dont waste your money  .
maybe the woes will be fixed w/ wm 7 , but i am skeptical  .
do not be a sucker for the display , get an evo if you can , or any other software platform from t    mobile  .
i am seriously disappointed this has happened on two phones for me , i returned the first buyer beware i know 2 other owners personally who have the same problems  .
it is truly pathetic .
everything is good , except battery life , voice quality  .
also most of the times the while calling if my ear or cheek touches the screen call disconnets  .
even when i am searching for the phone number most of the time it connects to some one else  .
i do not like this phone  .
this is the first touch phone i am using  .
i am already tired of this  .
it is already more than 15 days i bought this phone i do not know whether i can send it back or not .
if the hd2 were running android no phone on the market could touch it .
after spending 450 to upgrade to this phone , i had big hopes the only thing i like is the camera  .
period  .
this phone freezes all the time  .
i've had the phone for two weeks and still have not figured out how to change the ring tone  .
the touch screen is ok  .
i find myself retyping the same word about two to three time  .
the internet is horrible  .
internet explorer sucks and opera is not much better  .
facebook is not good you must load each profile everytime you click on it  .
you cannot comment from the status page or view wall posting to friends t    mobile service on this phone is not good the phone will drop calls when showing 3g loading a page on the web is worse than dial up i never write reviews in fact , this my first  .
i'm writing this to save someone 450 dollars this phone is junk  .
if you think that it's going to be a droid or that micro soft has changed anything with there crappy software ; you're wrong save you're money or you can buy mine for $400 updated  .
on jun 16 , 2010  .
this phone has so many features than any phone i ever had  .
it allows you to share your internet with your pc  .
you can download games from a pc to the memory card and play it on the phone  .
i love the quality of the picture and the video  .
you can record unlimited video depending on how much space you have i'm a phone geek but i almost crash this phone because of it slow performance  .
it freezes everytime you click an application  .
sometimes when you you change your track , you have to wait for 20 sec for that music to play  .
uhhh  .
, i hate when a song is buffering on window media don't go there  .
my cousin lives oversea ; this phone mistakenly call her number    when i clicked    end call    , it froze on that call and my cousin answered her phone i is charged for making international call but t    mobile settle this problem  .
anyway , i is sick of this phone and sold it on craiglist for $380 a $60 profit is not bad but the time i wasted to maintain it hurt me  .
do not buy this phone , you will regret  .
it's an ok phone  .
the os needs an upgrade asap if they want to compete with the iphone or blackberry  .
i delt with the issues for a month trying to over look the phone's flaws , but in the end i gave it back and went back to my bread and butter blackberry 9700  .
i sent it back after trying so hard to love it  .
it just put me over the edge after taking a call and i could not answer it because it crashed due to programs running in background that i did not kill  .
lame phone is not ready out of the box  .
if you want tweaks you have to go to obscure download sites and try some of the apps  .
its built for business not consumer consumption .
ok first of all i am coming from a jail broken iphone , with expectations for both business and personal use  .
so there will be comparisons first impression is wow this is a well built phone with an incredible screen  .
starting up it felt very familiar but different  .
the sense ui can carry the misgivings of windows mobile only so far  .
touch sensitivity is on par with the iphone the screen however is huge and super clear  .
at times it felt like the screen and phone is just too big  .
i have big hands and at times i just had to put the phone down  .
i could have gotten used to it in my pocket but would eventually have gotten a holder of some sort the 3g in the atlanta area is surprisingly fast in areas , paired with the snapdragon processor this device seemed to fly through applications  .
applications opened in a blink of an eye  .
you could open as many applications as you need , which may be a problem in its self  .
i had to keep task manager on my home page to close out things as the phone slowed down  .
downloaded opera 10 which is such a great browser for this device , except i experienced some issues with clicking links and some web pages would not accept opera as a valid browser my biggest disappointments may sound petty but when you are used to something its hard to take a step down from it  .
facebook application is like the early web app the iphone had , its limited and annoying that it goes back and forth between the application and the brower  .
youtube is just a joke , it is limited to its own operation and will not work with any other like a browser link or email link  .
this may be petty but why wouldnt the application have subscriptions included in it the overall flow of the phone to me seemed choppy and i found it cumbersome to move from one application to another  .
even with no multi    tasking the iphone seems to move from one application to another with ease and though its one app at a time it just seems to flow naturally  .
email a youtube link to yourself to see what i am talking about now though i have to admit that i is seriously impressed with the overall build of this phone i have to say there needs to be a soft reboot sequence other than removing the battery  .
especially if they continue to handicap this beautiful device with windows mobile  .
oh i remember how everyone complained about battery life on the iphone , it is a fact of life with a smartphone that you had to recharge at some point before you were really ready to  .
that said , this battery sucked  .
i could easily run the battery down 2    3 times daily  .
it is so bad i carried around a secondary power source , when i knew i wouldnt be near a outlet or my car  .
yes i had 3g on , wifi , and i guess gps  .
yes i pulled mail every hour , had notifications on for several applications  .
pretty much same routine for current phone there were several reasons i returned the phone ;  .
1) in the 4 years i have had an iphone i never dropped a call  .
day 2 with this phone on a conference call with a client sitting on my desk the phone decided to drop the call 2) found myself accepting some short comings of the phone and using it in conjunction with my ipad  .
i is now replacing one device with 2 , why  .
3) i got tired of having to reboot the phone  .
waiting for it to reboot so i could pull mail for a check in is the last straw 4) it may have been premature to decide on the battery life but at that moment it is unacceptable to be tethered to a power source that much 5) windows mobile sucks  .
i refused to upgrade from my mda until this phone came out  .
sometimes i wish i would have waited and not jump the gun so graet potential  .
but today i had request that my phone be replaced  .
the glitching go so bad and so frequent that the phone has not booted past the stay connected logo during bootup  .
i have not used the phone for two days  .
i hope that the new phone with teh new , upgraded software proves to be the answer  .
i really want the phone to succeed  .
will see next week  .
ant suggestions on tweeks for performance improvement or upgrades or apps would be greatly appreciated .
nice looking phone , just toooooooooo many problems for someone who needs reliable communications .
buy a phone with a more stable os  .
at t is not the greatest network but i never had problems with my iphone like i am having with this piece of junk  .
avoid windows phones at all cost in my opinion .
if you're in the market for a smart phone please do yourself a favor and get a phone running on the android operating system  .
i regret the day i first set eyes on the hd2 and now its my ugly companion for 2 years  .
t    mobile does not stand behind this phone at all  .
they admit its got many bugs and does not work as well as other phones  .
also , stay away from t    mobile if you're looking to switch providers  .
let's put it this way you get what you pay for in their service , support , and overall customer experience  .
i give t mobile an f in all of the above but again i'm stuck with these morons for 2 years .
i really poured my heart into this  .
many many hours and dollars  .
i could not even get the facebook app to sync  .
my friend bought a t    mobile nexus one and only entered her email address  .
bam , all social networks and all of her contacts synced minutes  .
i spent 75 dollars and seriously 7 days with no results  .
i give up updated  .
on jun 22 , 2010  .
i hate this phone  .
the web is so slow , its hard to text on , it is huge and clunky and cannot fit in your pocket  .
the only good thing is watching transformers on it  .
i am switching back to an unlocked iphone 3g .
i is over fascinated with this phone  .
however did not feel like possessing it after using for 12 days .
camera has sharp edge and stands out , windows mobile 6  .
5 (explains all the glitches) , screens shakes when you put finger to read through site ; that's if data connection does not fail (50% of the time you cannot access web because you will get a server connection failure  .
couple of times when i would slide to unlock phone for use , it would stay frozen .
a lot of people have talked about the eye candy that make this phone beautiful  .
i agree with them so i'm not going to repeat their comments  .
what i am going to focus on is the fact that the hd2's os is horribly designed for phone use i am really disappointed with this phone  .
i had the opportunity to run a motorola droid (first droid phone and picked up the same day) and the hd2 (third windows powered phone)  .
first of all , the from the time i activated the droid , it sync'd with my contacts , calendars and email and is fully functional within 10 to 15 minutes  .
the hd2 took over two days and i still had not discovered that making simple adjustments , such as the browser , required making changes in three locations (system , tools and on the app itself) just to function as shown in their advertising and get full html browsing  .
on the droid , i found that phone and system adjustments were all located in one place  .
on the hd2 , you have to look in 2 to 3+ locations and dig through several folders to make the same minimal adjustments  .
this is significant , because this type of difference extends to everyday tasks , making the phone useless when searching for a local business on the droid , just press the microphone button and speak  .
the droid will give you all results (internet , your contacts , etc) with the options to either call or navigate to the business and all within a few seconds  .
just to get phone number for the same business on the hd2 took , you have to go through several steps , a lot of frustration and when we finally got the phone numbers , we could not get the screen to respond to the phone number provided on the search  .
the phone eventually crashed and froze  .
additional , navigation is only available via an added monthly cost on the hd2  .
the challenge is keeping the phone running long enough to use it  .
bottom line in performance for a simple search task , it took the droid less than 30 seconds from pressing the first button to getting navigation started , the hd2 took 5 minutes to get to the information , then crashed  .
the punch line here is that we had to call the business on another phone because the hd2 had to reboot i really wanted to like the hd2 so that i could join my wife and kids on the family plan  .
unfortunately , the phone works so poorly that i am forced to spend more money and go with another carrier  .
it is a beautiful phone , the htc interface is incredible , but the os requires too much attention to be considered a business tool .
the nexus one beast the iphone hd2 didnt so cnet please stop playing musical chairs  .
i wanted to like this phone  .
every t    mobile store in my city is sold out for days i is on a wait list and finally , they called  .
that huge screen is great , but holding it for any length of time made my hand hurt  .
no kidding  .
the 3g network worked off and on  .
mostly , it went to edge  .
i liked the pinch    zoom , but the apps selection is ridiculous  .
bottom line is the phone is nice if you've got big hands and you're willing to wait until the bugs are worked out in the t    mobile system .
i wo not recommend this phone to anybody  .
the phone is too expensive to be having this kind of issues  .
sound quality is awful  .
the picture quality even when using the flash is very poor  .
the browser is super slow  .
i had to return it , i gave up  .
compare to samsung highlight , htc phone does not have a good security option to block applications to prevent others to have access too  .
i am considering getting the samsung galaxy soon .
all in all , i do not recommend this phone  .
it's fancy and cool but the core value , and quality of it is not worth the glamorous outside look  .
i'm currently fighting with tmobile to get a different phone .
this is the second one i've had , one already returned  .
they sent me a new battery it's just the same as the other two , last about 8 hours sometimes  .
in additions to the above it tries to connect to the web even though it is turned off  .
unable to get 3g service  .
i had an htc a couple of years ago , it is a great device .
i got this handset on 6/22/2010 i sent it back on 6/27/2010  .
i did not have this phone a full day when the problems began  .
i loaded music (150 songs) from my laptop to the storage card , the music player froze and i had to pull the battery to get the phone to work again  .
on occasion the phone would lag and freeze when i would try to do simple tasks like make a call , edit a contact , etc programs like slacker , windows media player , and facebook would work but then suddenly crash and i would get these program had to be closed errors  .
i would tap do not send but then the errors wouldn't stop so i had to keep turning the phone off to make the issue go away then the screen starting doing this disappearing act when it would go blank and then turn on by itself when i is trying to access programs from the start menu  .
also the 3g signal would mysteriously drop for like an hour and i is unable to use the internet , meanwhile my wife's phone , also t    mobile , would be working great on the 3g network  .
the virtual keyboard would also hang when typing a text message or an email at times also the hardware is solid however , when the os is working  .
the transformers movies played without any problem  .
the camera takes excellent pictures and the exchange activesync works flawlessly  .
however , when i tried to record video and play it back the phone would freeze up and lag again  .
so basically , i figured out that as long as i didn't use the music player or the video functions , the phone would work well , however , being that i paid over 200 for this device i expect for everything to work , especially since i only had it five days i regret getting this phone and after calling t    mobile , who has excellent customer service , i sent the phone back on 6/27  .
i will soon be getting another mytouch slide 3g  .
my wife has one already and that phone is flawless  .
it does not have the big 4  .
3 inch screen but it is running android 2  .
1 , and at least everything works without any hitches  .
i'll gladly downgrade to a 3  .
4 inch screen when i know that it will work do yourself a favor and do not get this phone , do some homework on google and you will see that even after the updates this phone is still garbage  .
t    mobile has many other phones that do not have the so called ooos and ahhs of the 4  .
3 inch screen but they are far superior  .
trust me they cannot discontinue this junk quickly enough .
is it the software or is it the hardware  .
does it matter  .
this device will reminid you of everthying you hate about microsoft products  .
lots of promised sizzle followed by dramatic disappointment       think vista  .
start with the basics like address book and calendar   both are extraordinarily difficult to use for business purposes ; the address book requires alphabetical scrolling through entries and the calendar is extremely difficult to change dates into future months  .
for a new calendar entry , you are forced to pick a time by scrolling a clock  .
the bluetooth is spotty in my car even though my old treo 650 worked perfectly  .
the sms post feature is hobbled by the screen    based keyboard , which is almost impossible to use without multiple re    typing of words  .
there is significant pause time when changing between applications  .
the phone screen displays previously dialed numbers , which are redialed if the something , like a coin in your pocket , touches the screen  .
once the device is in locked mode , you have to touch and slide an icon to unlock it , which can be dangerous while driving  .
the clock on the home screen is goofy since it automatically starts at the wrong time (not the last time displayed) when you sign on and then flips to the correct time , like a train station clock  .
(what idot at microsoft came up with that one  .
) it comes pre    loaded with all kinds of entertainment apps       like blockbuster       none of which have value to me .
bottom line , i think windows mobile has a long way to go  .
this phone's hardware rocks  .
great camera video is amazing dual led flash , great picture quality , sleek design , i am returning the phone tomorrow to t    mobile and canceling my t    mobile account to switch to at t for the iphone 3gs  .
i love t    mobile and have been with them for 7 years i know outside of the united states t    mobile is alot bigger then any sell phone company in america  .
competing with vodafon  .
basically t    mobile needs a iphone  .
t    mobile in 6 weeks will have the fastest internet on the market  .
so dont buy an hd2 from t    mobile windows mobile is horrible  .
i is excited when i learned that the local tmobile store had a brand new stock of these yesterday  .
i have been using a my touch for several months and before that the g1 and had become extremely reliant on my google calendar and google contacts  .
i went to the store and purchased one and immediately tried to set up the phone  .
i immediately discovered that the google calendar and google contacts would not synchronize properly  .
at one point , i got my google contacts , but they were not grouped , e  .
, family business  .
and then , it wiped them out  .
some of my calendar dates synchronized , but not all of them  .
i use my phone for business and when i am out of the office , it is nice to know that if my assistant puts something on my google calendar , it will instantly show on my calendar on my phone and anything that i put on my phone will automatically show on my calendar  .
google calendar synchronizes with outlook and you can , i am assuming , successfully synchronize outlook with this phone , unless you have microsoft exchange server (which many small business people like me do not) you can only synchronize with your outlook on your computer  .
even the store and t    mobile's online tech people could not make it work correctly for anyone who is used to and addicted , apparently like i am , to the google calendar and google contacts , this is not the phone for you  .
i returned the phone within an hour of purchasing it .
marriage of 3 partners   microsoft , htc and t    mobile makes it a nightmare for customers to want a product that works right out of the box .
product is not very useful for the items listed in my cons  .
you cannot even do a google search using a voice command  .
i got more use out of my blackberry curve .
unless the software is completely redesigned , or replaced with android it has no use .
note   i have a htc hd2 , i have owned it for 3 months , it has bad video playback , and very buggy windows mobile os i is given a free case by t    mobile for the htc    hd2 at the time of purchase  .
the htc hd2 , without the rubber case , looses reception in the left corner (fast)  .
i wonder how the reviewers of cnet let the htc    hd2 antenna problem slip by them , but slam apple .
i explained above in the cons so do yourself a favor do not buy this phone  .
although i spent $450 on this phone it has got to go  .
i hate it hate it hate it  .
never been so disappointed with a cellphone like this  .
i'm going back to boostmobile (dont want to be under a contract otherwise would go back to my iphone with at t) t    mobile got me with this one but they wont get me with another  .
i think if they gotten rid of the freezes that last so long you have to reboot the phone would actually be good  .
but what good is a phone that can do everything but cant do anything because its stuck on one screen  .
fix the freezes and you will be on to a great phone  .
the concept is great but the execution fell way short  .
oh yeah connecting to the internet from the 3g can sometimes be well you cant most of the time have to be on wifi .
if you are outside and it is windy and you do not have a a paper weight handy then this is the phone for you , you want to actually be able to call someone or look at anything on the web might not be a good choice  .
updated  .
on jul 14 , 2010  .
tmobile told me it is their version of the iphone but better  .
that is a lie    it is nothing like the iphone  .
i know people who have the hd2 and love it  .
i know several people who also disliked it and returned it  .
it's just all relative to what you are looking for in a phone  .
it sucked to me .
i like it  .
first of all   the screen  .
it's huge compared to an iphone , though the fone is quite big  .
it may not fit in you pocket but thats what they make cases for  .
it has great resolution , playing videos in hd the fact that it comes with a 16gb memory card is a big plus  .
the card comes with transformers 1  2 included  .
the second you see these movies being played , you will fall in love  .
it has many apps for it  .
including blockbuster wich i will say   runs verry slowly  .
the controlls are nice , sliding in a verticle manor like your jail broken iphone (lol  .
over all , this is a nice phone  .
it looks nice  .
and the screen is incomarable  .
it's good for all the things that any other smart phone can do and that's where the setbacks lie  .
i would only suggest buying it if you use t    mobile , or are used to htc  .
it's screen is not so big that it's a must have and the size gets really annoying at times when you forget your clip .
i have this for business only because my droid based phone was not supported by it get a droid if you can or an iphone  .
this phone is a case of saying it will do something to be competitve when in reality it cannot perform it hsa been an utter waste of time up through locking me out and not accepting my password tmobile said 'yup , we know it does this'  .
that's comforting if you want to lose your all of your info/media and have a phone that freezes then get this phone .
if you have to get windows mobile wait for win mobi 7  .
better yet get a 3g slide or the galaxy s or g2 like i did when my hd2 screen broke from just a wussy fall  .
i have had a ton of fun with android and it's only going to get better and faster with froyo 2  .
i love the physical keep pad and touch together and would never leave android now that i have it  .
summed up hd2 is not worth the money or waste of time  .
worst phone in the market , and regrettably t    mobile is not helping resolve the issues or provide solutions  .
they have treat me as it is my fault the phone does not work  .
talk about lack of customer support and responsability  .
very frustating .
for it's price and screen size , you should expect that this phone should deliver all the technological advances but it failed all my expectations of an expensive smartphone .
i is fooled by the 4    star rating here at cnet to get one about 5 weeks ago  .
the system freezes 3 times everyday  .
i am in the process of getting ride of it  .
do not get one or you will regret .
extreme lagging when texting/typing during text messages , web addresses , searching , updates on social networks (any app that requires text/type)  .
freezes between phone navigation  .
restarts on its own  .
had to master reset/factory reset the phone 4 times in 2 months to resolve issues (known issues apparently) such as device stating my pw is incorrect to unlock my phone  .
web browsers constantly shut down  .
the swype functionality delays when predicting your text as well  .
htc hd2    a big could have been but never was since day one  .
exchanged for the same model device and experienced same problems  .
total fail .
t    mobile knows this phone is no good  .
they tell users to power down the phone and re    boot , they even tell users to take the battery out of the phone while it is turned on as a preventative measure  .
at least once a week  .
i have also a mytouch which has been powered on for 8 months and never crashed once .
oh man i don't know where to start , i have went through 4 of these phones and the same problems , no matter how much you reset it  .
it's like hard reset , soft reset , hard reset soft reset every week  .
all the time the phone freezes repeatedly  .
this is t    mobile's way of signing your life for 2 years to them , horrible carrier on how they acted with this , after this contract ends i am done with them for good , there policy's is horrible they don't even exchange it unless u send it back like 10 times  .
everyone has this issue just look on you tube and hd2 forums  .
c    net never really explains anything , they just commercialize to get there money so don't believe there reviews a bit , look at what the user's say  .
i cannot even put music into my phone without it lagging , every time i put more then like 500 songs on my sd card the whole phone lags  .
you cant even put programs from the market on , every thing seems to lag the phone  .
microsoft has been killing us with there os , i hope mobile 7 will be as good as win 7 and will be like jumping from win vista to windows 7 , but for mobile phones it should be better , considering how horrible its been all these years htc is the hardware master at garbage hardware , there phones have always been fragile , on top of everything if it drops , a little drizzle of rain gets in and anything basically and you can flush it down the toilet  .
and trust me i have the latest updates and hardly have any programs on it as is , i don't even use my emails with it cause it lags so bad  .
i constantly have everything closed with task manager and run clean ram and registry all the time , and i have done this with all 4 phones , they come lagging out of the box , with the new updates  .
it is a horrible and horrendous phone the combo of windows and htc have created crap together again , this time on separate stools  .
comparing it to motorolla's and nokia's hardware , is like comparing plastic with iron  .
this will be my last htc phone , and i will never use windows mobile until win mobile 7 comes out  .
and if it will actually work then i might consider  .
overall do not by this phone  .
and stay away from htc products  .
if you don't trust me now you will know in the future  .
if you don't want to listen to me review it yourself , like i said before you tube and any hd2 forum and you will see the same issues with every single person , this has just been a defected product all together  .
look all over the internet and especially you tube on videos where and how it crashes  .
it has been a huge marketing scam , and do not be a victim .
i returned this phone before my 14day return period  .
you will disappointed .
i have been a proud owner of this phone for almost two months  .
i am currently on my third hd 2 , same problems as with the other two that i sent back  .
i have spent countless hours with t mobile customer service untill finally a miracle happened  .
while talking with the supervisor my beautifulll htc dropped her call 6 times in a 30 minute conversation , she actually kept calling me back and my phone would hang up on her  .
so here is the miracle they are taking this third one back and shipping me a my touch slide along with a 70  .
00 dollar credit  .
if you are a t mobile customer or maybe considering t mobile stay away from this phone sooner or later you will be very unhappy  .
all the bad things that you might have read about this phone is all true do not let the eye candy draw you in  .
so if you want a phone that freezes , drops calls , won' let you hang up or make calls then this phone is for you  .
one last thing i tried writing this review on my htc however it froze , i guess it new what i had to say  .
i highly recommend you dont buy this phone its a p  .
the worst phone i have ever bought from t    mobile thank goodness im a loyal customer and that are sending me the blackberry 9700 for free and dropping all chagers for the hd2 pos  .
this phone physically has an excellent design and looks pretty sharp  .
however the software is exactly what you would expect from windows  .
those who say that this is an improvement for windows etc are lying  .
it is exactly what you would expect from anything microsoft  .
it's clunky , laggy , and unpredictable  .
nothing works the way you would like it to every step is a fight to do everything  .
i took this phone back and downgraded it and am happy with that choice  .
this is by far the worst phone that i have ever laid hands on  .
i would not suggest this phone to anyone unless you want something to fight with tooth and nail and are determined to get it to work the way you want  .
this thing is not ready to enjoy out of the box .
this phone on paper looks great  .
the 1ghz processor , huge screen and the endless amazing little usability extras mean that it should be an iphone killer unfortunately in practice , it fails    presumably because it's running windows mobile  .
it's like htc are trying to build a skyscraper in quicksand    it just won't last it crashes all the time , it's weak and unreliable , awkward and effectively unusable  .
i hate it so much it gives me energy the first problem is text messaging  .
it sometimes wo not send messages immediately , but rather keep them hidden in the phone somewhere (hidden    not just in the outbox) until you next restart the phone (which is a frequent occurence because the phone needs to be restarted 2    3 times daily)  .
it is awkward if you're trying to message someone and you're not sure if they're ignoring you or not getting the messages (and they've removed the 'read message confirmation' option)  .
the only way to fix this problem is to patch the phone and block the htc sms interface and use the terrible windows one it also occasionally keeps transmitting after 'hang up' is pressed , so that if you start   about the person you were just talking to , they can hear it  .
awkward  .
picking up calls and hanging up calls also occasionally crashes the phone you'd think all the crashing is a result of having too many programs open , which is be easy to check with the old htc interface that had a task manager in the top corner in all programs , but here they've moved it    and still , running very little programs , it will crash or freeze for no apparent reason there are a bunch of other problems that upset me enough i blogged about it at http  //www  .
harrykey  .
com/blogs/the    htc    hd2    review    demon    phone/  .
i guess try it if you really want to  .
when your done messing around with it and tired of all the lag you will experience , just fork over the extra dough and get a nexus one .
-THE SCREEN. -1GHZ SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR. -3G/WIFI. -5MP CAMERA FLASH. -WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER ON BOARD. -BUILT IN APP AND HARDWARE FOR TETHERING. -16GB SD CARD. -PROXIMITY SENSOR. -ABILITY TO INSTALL APPS TO SD-CARD. -ANIMATED WEATHER DESKTOP BUILT IN; -GPS/NAVIGATION COULD BE BETTER. -RARELY, BUT STILL LOCKS UP ON OCCASION. (TYPICAL OF ANY SMARTPHONE, THEY RUN BETTER WHEN REBOOTED A FEW TIMES PER WEEK.. -WINDOWS MARKETPLACE (FOR APPS) IS GROWING BUT HAS SOME WORK AHEAD OF IT.
I LOVE TO WATCH MOVIES AND VIDEOS ON THIS PHONE. IT FEEL LIKE A LABTOP. THE SPEAKER IS VERY LOUD. YOU CAN USE IT AS A MODEN TO SHARE YOUR INTERNET WITH YOUR LABTOP.; THE HD2 IS VERY SLOW. IT FREEZES EVERY TIME YOU BROWSE AN APPLICATION. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TURN IT ON TO RESET IT. I BOUGHT ONE AND SOLD IT ON CRAIGLIST BECAUSE COULDN'T STAND IT. I;M A ENGINEERING MAJOR AND I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT...
"Make it Yours!"; Some would say Windows Mobile.... I disagree...

The screen &#38;nd camrea . ! thats it .; everythinq' its slow . slugish , the phone has too much of nothing .
Size, screen, apps really a perfect phone and device.; Why would anyone in their right mind put Windows on a device like that?
large screen, lots of features, 5MP camera, youtube, 16GB hard drive; Battery life is very short and very poor reception. Keeps loosing reception for no reason.
Big Screen, Bright Display plus preloaded movies, Flash on camera; Runs on Windows Mobile 6.5 (rumors say it won't be getting the new update to Windows Phone 7), Drops Calls constantly, Freezes on Swype texting feature, poor battery life
Fantastic phone very fast super responsive and best of all....looks nothing like windows mobile!!!; None yet, and thats a first for me.
You can do everything from watching a movie to writing a school paper. Best phone on the market!!; None that I can think of.
Looks good, that's about all I can say that resembles PRO!; The Battery won't even last 8 hours, everything is off GPS etc all turned off. It changes screens while setting on the Table.
Fantastic phone very fast super responsive and best of all....looks nothing like windows mobile!!!; Factory default customizations and settings are not optimal for stability or use
Screen...I get 3G all the time. I dont like Android. Win 6.5 workes great with Htcs Sense ui. Oh yeah its a great cell phone not a laptop........; Cant find one
The large screen and .the need for the win OS; The battery life could be better. And have not found 32g card
Great Screen. Great Pictures; Not a consumer phone like iphone or android phone.. its a commericial business phone with windows 6.5..SLOW. Crashes or freezes. Have to close programs or it will crash. HTC UI called Sense UI tried to hide Windows 6.5 bt it can't.
Screen, bettery life, 1GHz processor, nice feel to phone.; camera has sharp edge and stands out, Windows Mobile 6.5 (explains all the glitches), screens shakes when you put finger to read through site... (read bottom line)
Great display. Loaded with functions.; Getting use to a Touch Screen Keyboard. Would be nice to have a Slider Qwerty Keyboard, like the HTC Touch Version. But, I think I can adapt.
I love everything about this phone and I have had somewhere around 25 phones now this is by far the best!; There is nothing I don't like about this phone!
ITs big screen; windows 6.5 and htc sense is on every phone they make that has there logo practically is just a clock and weather,internet and weather buttons boring
The screen has to be seen live to appreciate.. There is a 14% discount for AAA members on TM service.; Fry's is out of stock at present, of course.
swype typing, screen, eye candy; Constantly crashes and freezes. you have had to remove the battery 2 to 5 times per day to reboot it. Simple adjustments are difficult to make. You can't take advantage of the phone's speed due to the OS's design.
Big screen, Microsoft sync; Need to reboot it once a day. Calls are constantly going to voicemail. Normally that doesnt bother me but my job requires me to be on call 24/7. Locks up at least twice a day. Keyboard refuses to deploy. Swipe kills the phone.
I LOVE THIS PHONE. IT has everything you want in a cell phone. And you can upgrade to win 7 Q4 or Q3. Take that Android.80% of androids apps are stupid...200 fart apps wow..........; Very big but thats ok more to look at!
screen, u.i., syncs to windows contacts and windows live, fast; battery life at frist is low, a little complicated when you are unfamiliar with windows, market place is horrible.
Looks great; The micro USB connector - why not the mini?. the lack of a stylus for the more intricate stuff. no transcriber handwriting recognition. Changing settings, and finding applications and enabling and disabling features is a bit cumbersome
Connections to calls easily, no drops. Display, Camera, Video, Flash, Touch Screen, External Speaker.; I spent a whole week and $75 dollars in apps trying to get it to simply sort my contacts by first name and sync with my Google Contacts, Calendar, PC and MAC. I am running Windows 7 and Snow Leopard. What a Windows based nightmare.. Microsoft only!!!!
swype typing, camera is good (better than iphone), with skyfire you can play flash videos, htc sence (no complaining about the windows os you can barely notice), 3rd party apps (download straight from the internet); Can only rotate on some applications or programs and can only rotate one way, Trouble deleting programs downloaded from the internet, marketplace needs improvement, can't put t.v. shows as easy as the iphone
-amazing and gigantic screen. - smooth capacitive screen. - HTC sense UI is beautiful and rivals iphone OS. -powerful camera. -Windows is very customizable; -phone feels awkward when talking due to size. - voice clarity can be a little better. - no front camera for skype video call
Humongous screen,packed with apps,good storage and connectivity and camera with flash,much better than the other phones presently in the market,and good looks best for business and multimedia; It is so huge that it barely fits in pocket,little low on 3g
Fast! Fast! Fast! VOICE COMMAND for hands free calling!!! Highly customizable, Great Photos &#38; Video, Great call quality, HAS NOT CRASHED...EVER, VERY STABLE. Beautiful user interface, it HAS &#38; DOES EVERYTHING that I've ever wanted in a cell pho; The Market place is a little sparse right now but you can get MORE apps at XDA Developers AND FreewarePocketPC.net. NO Google Maps with turn by turn nav... yet.
Clean lookin...great screen and resolution, camera is amazing, multitouch is nice. Windows mobile is nice, but confusing at first; UH.....none really, just hard to figure out windows at first...and where all the files and stufff are
Pros:. 1) Huge and very high resolution beautiful screen. Easy to read webpages and other items.. 2) At times, very peppy.; Cons:. 1) Keyboard is not easy to use, always hitting the wrong keys. (Biggest gripe).. 2) Hard to find items.. 3) At times too peppy, then at times slow as a snail.. 4) Hard to change some setting both Opera browser &#38; IE.(Will install SKYFIRE)
The screen is magnificent. Movies are an enjoyable experience. The camera is very nice. The sense ui when working is a pleasurable experience.; Constant errors, constant lag, constant freezing, lack of organization, terribly hard to sync, and overall more trouble than it's worth.
Huge screen. Easy to navigate, and I was critical on this part due to the fact that this was my first Android. Actual phone part was good. Camera was awesome. 16 GB memory card standard. Free gel protector. Would recommend to ANYONE!; Poor battery life (needs recharging daily). Not enough apps. Other than that, awesome phone.
Big screen, very nice to watch any videos, good photo quality.; Due to bad voice quality every time I am using speaker phone. Battery life is very less. if I use for 1-2 hours it goes to 0% battery. Even if I do not use for any video or internet just calling for 1 hour per day also battery comes to zero.
It has a big screen and a fast processor.; It crashes too often. Major problems include lost Internet service, lost e-mail accounts (once while the phone was in the hands of a T-Mobile rep), even my phone directory was lost; minor problems include speakerphone and ringer not working, others.
great screen size and quality,love the radio and entertainment; poor call quality i thought i was the only with the problem of it sounded like static during a call very frusterating also unresponsive screen freezing up and slow reboot not worth 500 dollars
Large High Quality Screen. Good Speakers. PS1 Emulator Support. Camera Touch Focus is amazing, highly recommended. Good video recording quality.. Easy Bluetooth tethering.. Screen is scratch-proof.. 3.5 mm audio jack; Limited App support. Overheating problem causes battery drain. Native music player will lag and freeze your phone. Camera sticks out of phone. Price ($480 + 16GB memory). GPS not working (Being an AT&#38;T user might be the cause). Switching to landscape lags.
Large screen,. T-Mobile gave a FREE CASE at the time of puchase (case seems to solve the "dead zone" antenna problem of the HTC HD2); Very buggy Windows Mobile OS ( I had T-Mobile re-install OS - twice).. Screen colors are muted. Windows Market Place has very limited apps.. SMS does not work properly.. OS has memory leaks.. Antenna problems without the rubber case...
The fast processor and huge screen are great. The interface (when it works) is awesome.The WiFi internet sharing is brilliant.; It crashes and freezes all the time.. Texts don't send.. Calls continue to transmit after pressing hang up.. HTC Support doesn't support.. Screen (and camera) goes pink.
best thing about this phone is the preloaded Transformers movie. Video quality is superior to the iPhone. That's where the 'pros' stop.; Freezes constantly, buttons don't always work (hit 1 and 3 appears). IM/text doesn't update mid-conversation. You must back out of the program, reopen,find the person in your contact list. Stays frozen even after battery removal.
YOU CAN LOOK BUT YOU CAN'T TOUCH! CAUSE IF YOU DO, IT WILL GO OUT TO LUNCH ON YOU.. other than the HD feature...high resolution pictures and video will the only thing I'll miss on this phone.; the phone locks up all the time and it's random. speratic lock up lead to unreliability. If this is your business phone, you're bound to close for business. ineffecinet, and unproductive, it is the most un-user friendly phone ever made.
1. It Multitasks!! Yay. 2. Better, Faster, Stronger.... 3. Great audio quality. 4. HTC Sense. 5. Great camera with flash. 6. It Multitasks! I don't have to shut down Pandora/Slacker to check email/text/facebook/surf.; 1. Need bigger buttons for "Confirm", "Reply", "Ok", etc. The screen certainly is big enough to accomodate.. 2. There aren't a zillion apps available.. 3. Apps that are available are often overpriced ($20?? Really?)
Big Screen, Easy to navigate the web...when it works!; The phone locks every time I try to use any feature. Need to reboot at least 5 or more times a day. Locks and drops the calls randomly. Have already replace the phone once, the card, the battery and nothing helps. The battery only last a few hours
The big screen is nice and the picture quality amazing; It runs very slow. On top of that when you open an application and close it, it really still stays open until you go into open applications and close it. Then texting became slow. Just dont buy this piece of crap.
Strong processors, great for movies, contains other innovated idea's.; Biggest fault in this phone is that it has the Microsoft operating system. All software costs money, interface is confusing and non-practical. I returned this phone before my 14day period for a refund
Design, size, great in THEORY !!!; Slow, freezes, and finally died, I have owned cell phones from day 1, the is the only one that never worked properly, and died. I was told I could take it back for replacement, but I dont want to have the liability.
Runs Winmo 6.5 and Android 2.2 Beautifully. What else could I ask for. Video playback support is basically unlimited in terms of formats. Flash 10 is awesome. Android games are way cooler that their Iphone siblings in that massive 4.3" scree.; Standby Battery life in Android currently now 20-30hrs. With light usage you can expect somewhere between 15-30hrs. Depends on how u use it and at which processing speed. (mines clocked at 728mz and still a beast)
the phone itself is excellent. camera quality is unmatched. very user friendly. highly customizable; can be sluggish at times, i actually had to swap my first one out for another due to lag and freezing issues. battery life sucks
Its look, big screen, nice resolution.; -Always Freezes. -If you read through forums you will understand what i mean, battery needs to be taken out 5 times a day to unfreeze.. - cant insert a lot of music on SD card, lags the phone and doesn't play.. -cheap fragile htc hardware as usual
Great pictures!!! Love the Transformers movie (one of the reasons I got it). Messenger apps in one location. Microsoft Office. Can link contacts with Facebook.; Unable to setup up both Hotmail accounts nor Outlook; has frozen on my twice; maybe a bit too complicated for me (former BB user; a bit slow at times; poor battery life!!!
-Fast. -Awesome Screen. -Good Camera. -Applications. -Usefulness. -Good Speakers. -the looks and the feel of the phone. -weight; -Sketchy Rom updates from TMobile. -Rom Update causing phone to freezes. -Not really a quality camera phone (I down graded from a 8MP pixon). -Battery life is junk ( Should have came with a 1800 or 1600mah battery). -No Call Manager app
A huge screen that works well with Swype, 5 MP camera with autofocus and flash, interesting apps included, and Transformers 1 &#38; 2 preloaded. The call quality and web-browsing experience are crisp and quick (only with 3g for the latter, though).; Windows Marketplace doesn't offer as great a variety in apps as the Iphone or Droid Marketplaces.
has a big screen, able to touch it right the 1st time, easy to see, love the flat design; Does not compare to the android market at all, you hv 2 pay for tha apps, 3g network is rarely available, cannot mms, nor browse while you are on the phn, battery don't last lng
Great picture quality. Movies look great. The touch screen keyboard is easy to use. The flashlight accessory is great.; Freezes constantly. Crashes all the time. Even after downloading new firmware and clearing the memory regularly this phone crashes constantly. I have lost my email inboxes once and all my pictures have disappeared twice.
Big Screen. GPS works well, but has no voice commands, so you have to pay extra tog get a good navigator app.; Poor call quality, line will go dead on both sides quite often. Apps are useless and expensive. You have to buy anything that is of any use from Microsoft Marketplace. Low battery life compared to Blackberry.
Does what it claims - email, web preferences (via Opera!) that's easy to navigate. Windows Mob 6.1 syncs well with PC - no hicups like Palm 755. Call quality and email client for HTC good. It's big, but looks great. Good camera and video.; Buy from knowledgeable store person (T-Mobile on Monterey Highway in SJ really great). Contacts is hard to use need two hands vs. thumb ball. "Virtual" keyboard hard to get used to. Mob 6.1 can't sync with Google Calendar.
Huge Screen with great quality. Best PDA. Only touch screen phone that I have seen where I can actually type on without correcting every other letter. Built in FM Radio. Fast Processor. Built in GPS. Camera with flash. Amazing flashlight.; Pretty bad call quality on my phone. This may have been just my phone because no one else has complained. To much static. Very touch sensitive. Would randomly hang up on my calls and call someone else. Sometimes locked up and takes forever to reboot
Low profile &#38; larger screen is much better than iPhone. Easy to slide in back pocket and hold on to. Love HTC's Sense user interface. Great product for watching movies.; Microsoft. Lack of documentation. Tech Support is not ready. Sync issues resulted in the unit repeatedly shutting itself off. Touch screen is too sensitive. Flying hand over or sliding unit over ear resulted in opening random apps and making calls.
Great Tech specs... you already know them. The screen is great, not as many apps, but enough to keep you distracted.; Freezes 3-4 times a week.. from making phone calls!! After about 2 weeks of decent use, the freezing starts. I constantly delete messages to keep the system clear (I also use the tsk manager to close unused programs)... problem persists.
the touch screen and that is it!; i bought the phone in march and its only the middle of may and i'm on my 3RD!!! replacement! the phone freezes up,unable to access the web,must do a master reset at least once a day,even after doing a end all task a million times
Email that works the way it should. The most customizable OS period. The best hardware available. T-Mobile easily has the best prices of any major carrier. Multitasking, tethering, great camera, GPS that works, Does everything my Iphone couldn't; Comes with great content but hard to find any more. Factory default customizations and settings are not optimal for stability or use. Marketed to the masses, who frankly don't have the patience or logic to fix the just plain stupid default settings.
Screen size is lovely, I love the fact that I can sync to Outlook. I am a Windows fan, not Apple so this is the perfect OS for me. Its like I'm carrying around a computer in my purse.; You do have to research some things for this phone. Its not easy to use. If u want, make sure u are prepared to spend time setting up, looking for info on internet.
Huge Screen and great sound with head phones. Super fast and very versatile. Tons of potential.; More Apps. There are plenty out there but not of great quality. This thing has so much potential but it seems T-Mobile has really kept it back. The HTC Sense has been great but the Windows Mobile is still easily overloaded.
Great Screen and flashy interface and that's about it!; Phone was rather buggy and acted up all the time. I had to trade it with someone for a Nexus One on Craigslist. Had the G1 and really missed the Android system too because of all the free apps! Windows Market place sucks!
Users can customize the HD2 to the maximum. Speed is lighting fast with 1Gz CPU. Touch screen is the largest, has a hard glass surface, and feels comfortable. Multi-tasking capability is awesome. It's arguably the most powerful smartphone today.; I use it often so it sucks a lot of battery power. The problem is solved with an extended 2300 mAh battery.
best phone i had in years screen is nice and big and love the weather. the head phone jack is very useful, u can plug it in, into ur car line input and listen to music and answer calls, sound quality is great too ( when plug in); keyboard r very hard to use. u cant get the right letter without overlapping to the next letter. somtimes it freezes, somtimes the menus can be hard to uses, also while playign game and having aim messenger running can be laggy at times
It Turns On; So far I have had three of them. When it does not freeze it never holds a signal. This is the first phone I have had in six years that when I am in a back bedroom I get nothing. It switches from E to 3G always. Buy a 2 cans and long string instead
16GB card included, HD Screen, Mobi TV, 1gig Processor, Sleek, 5 MP Camera. The phone works great in between menus and the 3G modem capability was great!; The phone is way too slow when sending and incoming text messages are being done simultaniously. Lost data connection many times, and I had to take out the battery 2 to 3 times a day to reset the phone.
Pros, the harware rocks, almost doubling the iphone 3gs in all aspects.; Software, windows needs to get outta the cell phone market cause they suck. I have owned this phone for 13 days now and this phone does nothing but freeze up, i have to pull the battery out of it at least 10 times a day to re-set it. BATTERY LIFE
Great HTC Phone. Love the big screen.; It runs Windows. It got old taking the battery out a hundred times a day. The upgrade T mobile has does not work. The market place is horrible. I finally gave phone away and moved back to my G1. I'm switching to Verizon where they use Android.
Huge crisp display, extremely slim profile, modern design and casing, sturdy build quality, camera takes excellent pictures, has flash, really snappy processor, built-in FM radio, HTC Sense lightening up WM, and a great mod community backing it up.; Huge screen also not suitable for everyone although pocketable, Windows Marketplace has lack of good apps, camera sticks out of the rear of the phone (be careful with banging the phone down the table, out-of-the-box using inconvenient options.
The phone is great in theory, the screen is very responsive. The picture quality and screen quality is amazing.; The battery life is terrible. With a full charge it lasts probably 5 hours. With only texting, and screen viewing. The screen freezes and to get it to work again you have to remove the battery. The speaker phone feature doesn't work half the time.
How it is supposed to interface with Outlook. Wide spectrum of graphical features and the free wallpaper looks nice, but $600 is a lot to pay for free wallpaper. Free rubber case, probably cost 2 cents to include in the box.; After over a week of experiene, nothing worked well and screen based text entry was damn near impossible. I've never had problems with the T-mobile network using TREO devices so I can't blame T-mobile as did a previous commenter.
Fast, great and very bright touch screen, oodles of useful software right out of the box.; the Mobile Windows OS is clunky, but manageable. What surprised me was the lack of many programs that are readily available on the i phone and Android phones, even though, the Windows OS had been on the market for a long time.
Possible the Best SmartPhone Ever Created. . . . . EVER!! HTC Sense, 1GHZ Processor, Light &#38; Thin, 5MP Camera with Xenon Flash, Great Call Clarity, Pinch &#38; Zoom Feature. . . and the list goes on. The list is too long for 250 characters.; What?! Because it runs Windows Mobile 6.5? . . Is that really a problem, considering that it incorporates the HTC Sense which allows for a smooth and powerful experience. Also, you will be able to upgrade to Windows Mobile 7 once available.
The only features I love of this phone is that the screen is big and bright .; 1) The media window player it freezes the whole phone and does not let you do anything.. 2) It takes to long for the main screen to show.
This phone has a terrible OS. Windows Mobile 6.5 if abysmal and clunky and HTC Sense only saves it a little bit... I am currently running HyperDroid v1.2 which is a CyanogenMod of Froyo 2.2 and it runs amazingly.; Windows Mobile is stuck on the phone at the moment. Meaning you can't completely remove it. Booting into Android from WM is pretty painless though. Battery life is also terrible on this phone.
Reading emails is a pleasure on this phone. As a business oriented person, that is a big deal for me. It acts as a PC but it is mobile. Great customizations from XDA developers to give you a more clean home interface. Tethering is a plus.; Alarm clock did not sound off continuously to alert me to wake up. I downloaded a 3rd party application to fix that problem and it basically bypasses the pre-installed clock and integrates itself in its place.
The screen is huge. The 2 Transformers movies play and look great on the screen. The phone looks great!; The phone freezes so much! Everyday sometimes 3-4 times a day it has to be rebooted. The apps hardly work. Had the phone 2 months and had to have three hard reboots causing me to lose everything. Cant enjoy because of all the reboots and freezes.
The Huge screen makes watching videos, movies and web browsing practical for the first time on a wireless device. It gets better signal than any other Smart phone I have ever used.; Its hard to find. I wish there were more apps in the Market place but there are 1000's of apps out there in 3rd party land
Great screen, you can tether for internet, fast internet speeds, camera and video recording are great. Syncs great with social networks, youtube, and email contacts.; The user interface, menus, and settings are scattered all over the phone with little continuity or intuitive feel. The OS hangs especially when listening to music. Text messages screen hangs. Battery life is short. Preloaded with useless apps.
Very fast. Tons of Space. HUGE!. Very receptive touch screen. So many other pros that I just can't name them all.; Haven't found any yet...and I've had the phone for about a month now.. It is tougher to navigate to the settings screen because of HTC Sense. The Microsoft settings are a bit hidden, and sometimes it's these that are the one's people want to change.
* Super fast. * Very smooth. * Lots of RAM and ROM. * Stunning screen. * Top notch apps included (hundreds of thousands more available for free); There is really nothing at all bad with the HD2. The only possible thing that I could think anyone could have as a complaint, is that it is possibly approaching too big for someone with small hands. But the screen is amazing and well worth it.
Very easy to get to navigate around the phone because of the keyboard, touchscreen and windows start. Screen is big enough to read emails and text without any struggle. The sound quality is great due to the big speaker. Batter life is great.; I am not an apps but if you are, Windows likes their money and do not offer a lot of free apps like Android.
Beautiful screen and size. It's not too big to fit in a shirt pocket and Sense from HTC make Win Mobile acceptable. It's OS is very logical and intuitive.; Battery life is basically one day of moderate use, but just charge it every night and you are good to go. Biggest complaint is the not enough apps. Win Mobile needs to get on the stick as we are a distant third to Apple and Google.
Very fast and smooth and easy to use. The screen is the best looking i have ever seen. Now all i need to do is sell my new ipod touch since i have no need for it with this phone. Feels great in my hand.; Screen is a little touchy and hard to scroll without clicking on something until you get used to it. Need more Apps.
It was a lot of fun compared to my blackberry Pearl Flip and 8900. I enjoyed it for the fact it was my first touch screen and seemed like a good choice with all the hype and 1 gig processor. It had some movies 2 to be exact and that was cool; Operating System the WORST!!!!! WOW!! I hope windows mobile 7 is better in leaps and bounds because even 2.1 android beats the tar out of it without even trying. No where near the functionality of Android or even apple. DON'T BUY THIS!! GET FROYO
Its nicely designed with a very vivid lcd screen. Great youtube playback. Music is easy to look through, you browse music almost exactly like iphone. Amazing camera and you can use the extremely bright dual leds as a flashlight (an app for it).; Very terrible software. Very buggy. Ive had to remove the battery countless time when it freezes up during SMS texting. This is just simply not acceptable. I seriously want to break my phone sometimes, I was mislead and letdown by t-mobile big time.
It has a beautiful 4.3 inch screen and can run many different programs. It also has windows software which might not be a perk to some but i think they did a great job with this phone.; I would say that the only flaw in this phone is the battery life but then again the phone is running many different applications, it isn't going to have the best battery life.
The most amazing picture quality around. I can and have watched a 3 hour movie on it and looks better than my gmas tv. Office 2010 and the Omarket are wonderful. Great mobile pics, especially for the frequent social network user.; After a couple of months of use, it begins to hang a bit. Not too bad, but with all the expectation of a windows device you would expect better. It is a bit large and wont upgrade to windows 7.
