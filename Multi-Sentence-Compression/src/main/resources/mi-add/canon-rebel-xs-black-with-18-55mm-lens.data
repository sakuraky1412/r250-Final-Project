real life photo taking  .
at the time in 2009 , i needed a extra camera    for a short time tried to reg  .
with canon    a joke updated  .
on mar 28 , 2010  .
all in all , this camera is probably the best bang for the buck  .
it comes with a nice starter lens , but you will need to upgrade if you want to take long distance photos  .
this is my first dslr and i'd recommend it to anyone  .
it's easy to use , takes wonderful photos , has many add    ons , and is cheap  .
it takes a normal sd card , so memory is easy to come across and afford  .
if you're looking for a cheap , first time dslr , i'd say go for it , as you will not be disappointed ; i know i was not this is a link to my redbubble profile , all the photos were taken with this camera and the starter lens (until i get my sigma 70    300mm)  .
enjoy c   http  //www  .

i love the concept of a digital slr because of interchangable lens being able to compose your shots and do unlimited things to the pictures after they are taken no developing or waiting for prints etc  .

the rebel eos xs delivers  .
i've worked with this camera for eight months now and i've held off reviewing because i've wanted to provide my accurate opinion  .
this camera performs rock solid in any situation , and it's pictures look absolutely beautiful  .
it's a fantastic camera for hobbyists and amateurs alike  .
the xs delivers dedicated buttons for almost any feature which is rare in the dslr realm  .
most cameras will have you struggling thru menus within menus to find options  .
the menu system it does have is simple to navigate and honestly makes sense , which is a nice departure from typical menu systems that have options spread out between multiple in    menus is this camera the end    all , be    all of digital photography  .
of course not , but this camera does exactly what it's supposed to do and it does it amazing  .
i've taken photos with this camera that rival my sister's wedding pictures which were taken on a nikon d300  .
it's a fantastic learning camera that will assist you in every way as you get more comfortable with the camera you can start exploring it's different modes  .
go from fully automatic to completely manual in just a couple turns of the dial on top  .
i found the viewfinder to be nice and large and that i could hold up the camera comfortably ; it's much lighter than a traditional slr and i must say that it does help when trying to hold zoom lenses by hand i don't use the included software (i use aperture 2) so i cannot comment on that , but i can say if its as user friendly as the camera then it should be great too it's true you can get more expensive dslrs out there that will have higher mp counts and iso levels (although i don't understand the appeal of having astronomically large iso levels    unless you love grainy shots) but imho i believe unless you are a professional and looking for the absolute top    of    the    line , you're wasting your money if you decided to go with a different camera just because it's more expensive  .
when i is in the market i is considering the nikon d60 , but after looking at and reading some reviews i decided to go with the rebel and i'm glad i did  .
i could not get be happier this is a not an investment you will regret in any manner ; if you are in the market and looking for a great dslr , stop reading reviews    go out and get this camera  .
great camera and it takes great pictures  .
what more do you want  .
first of all hatsoff to its pure image quality , this is my first dlsr camera  .
after a long research finally i got settled with this camera  .
happy that i got this one instead of spending extra bucks on xsi  .
i suggest everyone to buy this camera  .
only thing i didnt like is the design , which may cause your hands to lose grip .
great camera for anyone , espeically if your not well versed in photography , this thing makes you look good at taking pictures with minimal effort .
the canon xs is a great camera  .
the only difference between it and the xsi are the live view , screen size , and about $200  .
i highly recommend this camera to anyone who is starting out with a dslr but wants something that can keep up with their increasing knowledge of dslrs .
this review confuses me and if you want the best photo quality and/or need fast , low    light focus , the canon rebel xs outshines its competitors  .
however , it doesn't deliver the best value for the money overall ; that nod goes to the pentax k200d  .
is not getting the best photo quality the whole point  .
if you weren't primarily concerned with getting better quality photos , you probably would not be buying a dslr in the first place .
great buy for people who enjoy photography as a hobby or want to excel in this craft .
i do not have anything to compare rebel xs to as this is my first dslr , all i can say is that i am happy with my decision of buying it instead of rebel xsi because i is able to save a couple of bucks for lenses and accesories  .
i am not a pro but using canon rebel xs makes me feel like one  .
for photography enthusiasts who are planning on switching from a compact point and shoot to a dslr , canon rebel xs is a good option  .
this is my first dslr , and i'm really satisfied  .
i've read some of the reviews the pro's have made regarding this camera  .
sure , if you are a pro , i can see why you might want something with more features  .
but for the average joe , this camera is all you'll need  .
within minutes of taking it out of the box , i is snapping off beautiful shots  .
bought it on sale (saved $50 off the base price and got an additional $350 in free gear thrown in)  .
so from a bang    for    your buck perspective , this camera ranks high  .
a friend bought the same camera and is equally impressed .
after many month of reserch and reading reviews and comparison  .
i finally decided to go for the xs from amazon and i am very happy with this decision i love this camera  .
this is great camera  .
it has to be one of the better dollar for dollar dslr cameras out there  .
for anyone who is a semi    serious amateur photographer , you simply can not go wrong here  .
the question becomes if you want to chalk up the extra $200 for the xsi  .
i personally do not think it is worth it  .
the only major differences is a jump from 10 megapixels to 12 and a 3 lcd instead of the 2  .
personally , i would rather put that money toward a nice lens this is not the greatest camera out there but that means you are not paying large amounts either  .
i have nothing bad to say about it so far  .
it is easy to use and it is a great value  .
if you are thinking about getting into the world of the dslr then strongly consider this camera  .
i would also strongly suggest that you purchase some sort of handbook on how to get the most out of your camera as a side note , i also strongly suggest that you lean towards canon when deciding on a dslr  .
i say this because i believe that canon makes the best lenses out there  .
i know that some lenses are compatible with separate brands , but it just makes sense to work with the same brand .
i bought this camera because i grew more and more frustrated with or point shoot camera's capabilities  .
i wanted something that would take great pictures of our kids playing sports and be as easy to use as a point shoot  .
i listened to a friend who told me to save the few bucks on this over the xsi and get an additional zoom lens  .
canon hit the mark with this one .
its a cheap , wide range of lenes , excellent image quality , easy to use  .
a good starter slr might leave you wanting more i dont know  .
i have used other dlsr's but this is the first one i've owned  .
its a great camera  .
as long as photo is not your life this is a great camera  .
it has a lot to offer and can do a lot  .
great layout and setup  .
great quality pictures  .
i is a pro photographer for 20 years and did promo work for pentax  .
i shot hasselblad , pentax 6x7 , and pentax lx    pro cameras  .
i moved to canon disgital with the release of the d60 , but started doing more writing than shooting , so never upgraded until now  .
i wanted pro    style features but wanted to keep the cost down  .
user reviews led me to choose the xs and i couldn't be happier  .
forget the cons you read hear , they're nitpicking  .
who says a pro camera cannot be small  .
no date stamp  .
every pic has shot data attached , including the shooting date and your name if you want  .
focus point display  .
did not even notice it after five minutes shooting  .
a 3 lcd is so much better than a 2  .
put on your glasses  .
live view is about as pro as you can get       seeing the image pop up on the laptop is perfection  .
need more than 1600 iso  .
really  .
ok , if you're doing that many night shots , or shooting jets , then you probably need a $5000 digital  .
the kit zoom that came with my xs does a beautiful job and i'd challenge anyone to pick my photos out of a lineup with l lens images  .
bottom line , if you have an unlimited budget , go for the 1d mark iii and a bagfull of l lenses  .
if you want the best dslr for the price , pick up an xs .
to me there is no better camera to enter the dslr game with  .
quality is as good as any other camera from $500    $1000 msrp so there are not too many reasons to buy a t1i instead , given the price difference  .
the photographer can use virtually any canon slr lens (film or digital    there's no difference) made since the late 80's  .
this means that you can outfit yourself like crazy for a few hundred dollars , unlike sony or olympus cameras which have few options  .
even nikon does not have as many compatible lenses in their line    up  .
my best piece of advice for any photographer is to invest in adobe photoshop lightroom 2  .
0 or newer , as this allows you to make a snapshot look like a work of art with a few tweaks of the sliders  .
always shoot in raw mode and develop your photos in lightroom as if in a darkroom for film  .
you will be really , really happy with this camera .
my dad is a professional photographer in the 70s and 80s and i have been an avid photographer for a while  .
until digital , i used a pentax me super 35mm and sometimes a yashica d twin lens medium format the first digital camera i ever saw , i bought  .
it is a casio qv    10 , 320x240 for $300 in 1997  .
i then got a kodak dc215 1mp my last camera is a canon powershot a610 5mp point and shoot  .
it did a great job for snapshots i wanted to step up to a dslr to tap into my creative side cons   no date stamp    this is my biggest beef  .
canon uses the exif system to implant date , time , f    stop , iso speed , shutter speed , etc into the image  .
my a610 only has date stamp on 1600x1200  .
it may be weird to date stamp a top quality photo , this camera is made for soccor moms and proud fathers , not a pro  .
i still like to print them out to give to relatives and it would be real nice to have a date stamp  .
also a name stamp (type in your name) would be nice so noone would steal your photos  .
only raw +l    i like to shoot raw but would like the option of saving it as a 2  .
5mp jpeg so i could 'preview' the raw before converting it (not really a big deal)  .
i am male and have big hands and the grip feels small but my tiny mother in law likes it (personal taste)  .
this thing is a computer , many different modes and styles and functions , may take a while to really understand it all and the owners manual is good for getting started , not real good for advanced features  .
strobe flash for af    when i'm shooting people and the flash strobes , some people think i've taken the shot and start to move , my a610 p+s uses a red beam for af 2 biggest pros   bracketing    this is the reason i chose the xs over nikon d40 or d60  .
it has both auto exposure bracketing and color bracketing and its 1 button for 3 images , perfect for hdr  .
other big pro is that it could be a great camera for years and years to come  .
lenses and accessories will still be available for a very long time  .
if you hook up a $1500 usm af super zoom lens , you'll get shots like the pros  .
only canon and nikon are generally used by the pros and can rightfully claim they are pretty much future    proof other pros (pretty much same as nikon)   good kit lens , flash is decent if you don't want to spend $300 and lug it around , screen is easy to read in direct sunlight and show settings in an easy to read format , very lightweight and small for a dslr , battery life is excellent    i get 300    400ish shots with full af , screen on and some flash other considerations   nikon d40 or d60 would have been my choice except no bracketing on either model and lenses were a bit more expensive in general  .
olympus e520 is ok but has a smaller sensor and much less local availability for new and used accessories  .
pentax k2000    much less local availability but it comes with an external flash and can use all the old pentax lenses  .
sony alpha a300 is available and uses the minolta lenses but image quality is a lot worse than canon and nikon bottom line   great for people who want a camera for a long time , want to use it creatively and do not care about spending a little more cash in the future  .
i think the canon edges out the others just a little bit  .
if you just want to point    and    shoot , forget this or any dslr .
excellent entry level cam .
if you are looking to a dslr that is just an upgrade from a point and shoot then i suggest looking at the sony a330  .
the xs has very good picture quality in comparison to other entry level dslr's but requires allot of experimenting to know how to use it (for those who are inexperienced with dslr's)  .
i highly suggest this camera for students and hobbyists because it is a great camera to get you off the ground so you can later use higher quality cameras  .
i love this camera for its learning curve , i do wish it could take better night shots though this definitely a camera to look at , if you are looking at this price range .
all in all a great camera to get your creative juices flowing  .
aftab sayed says get one i have it .
all in all , ok camera , the cheapest among canon lineup and the worst one  .
if you are serious about photography , take 50d or better  .
if you are not    take a mirrorless aps    c cam from samsung or sony .
for the casual non professional , this camera is too big  .
i never take it with me because it does not fit in my purse or pocket  .
it lives in my car  .
that says a lot about my expertise in photography uh none but i still want quality photos both for work and play  .
i'm returning it for a canon s90 , better choice for the non    pro who prefers to be unemcumbered by photo equipment .
even though this is the cheapest canon slr , it is not really a good value  .
for about $100 dollars more , you can get the more advanced xsi  .
the xsi has a higher resolution (12 mpg vs 10 for the xs)  .
better processor (14 to 12 bit)  .
remote controll shooting capabilities , high tone priority , sport metering , better coverage using the viewfinder (87% to 81%)  .
i found the grip to be more confortable on the xsi once you use the limited features of the xs , you wish you got something that had more for a couple of hundred dollars more , you can get a 40d which has the xsi features inside a bigger , tougher magnesium body , more iso choices including 3200 iso , faster burst rates .
when you buy a digital slr , you have to ask yourself a question    what do you want to do with it if you want to turn pro in the future , then you probably know you have to spend a lot more money (thousand) to add on good equipment in the future for professional photos  .
i would suggest you to just buy this camera body without the kit lens  .
the lens is junk  .
you cannot use that for professional shooting anyway  .
it's just waste of space  .
you probably get frustrated with its' limitation and mediocre results while learning anyway  .
it's pointless and not even good enough for beginners if you want an slr for semi professional looking photos for business purpose  .
for example , you are an entrepreneur and you want to diy and shoot some nice photos for marketing material  .
i love your spirit  .
but with that kit lens , it won't look semi professional  .
again , body is ok , lens is useless if you want a dslr as a hobby because you saw some nice photos in the magazine and you want to create that  .
keep in mind that an entry level camera kit won't cover your needs at all  .
dslr photography as a hobby is a money pit , you have to spend a lot more than you imagine , then you can finally create something semi pro or like pros  .
otherwise , an entry level camera kit with a lame kit lens will barely make your photos better than your point and shoot snapshot  .
sure , you get shallow depth of field with an slr , that a point and shoot or bridge camera cannot offer  .
but the rest of the picture quality is just not there if you want a dslr as a hobby to produce better shots for your personal photo albums  .
you are not really trying to create something looking like magazine photos  .
you just want your photos to look better than your regular snapshots  .
then you have you consider if you really want to much more than this camera kit to just achieve that  .
because this camera kit won't necessarily make your photos look better  .
to achieve your goal with a dslr , you need to spend more money to buy decent lens  .
then you need to consider if it's worth it or you prefer to spend something on something else  .
many friends of mine think they will be able to create better personal photos with an entry level camera kit and lots practice  .
they are disappointed the default lens won't create better shots after all the study and practice , and they only find out the lens is so limited and in poor quality  .
their original budget is just the price of this camera kit  .
they have never been willing to spend a lot more  .
so they are stuck with a camera with a useless lens and no extra money for this hobby do some research about good lens first , then you will know the real price tag of getting the right and necessary equipment for dslr this lens is so lame , it makes people look uglier in the photo  .
i am not kidding  .
we know that those point and shoot cameras actually create excellent macro shots because the way the camera is built  .
if this lens does not make you look prettier than point and shoot , then what's the point having it  .
overall , if this is your first experience with a dslr style camera , you will think its a god among digital cameras  .
if its not your first time playing with dslr cameras , you will thinks its horrible  .
i found that auto focusing is slow , the live view feature is more annoying and ridiculously designed than it is practical  .
let my tell you how much i hate the live view feature  .
to begin , you have to go into a menu , then select it  .
i strongly dislike that , there should be a button to switch between live view and evf  .
then you have to press the shutter button to take a preview of the picture that you are taking  .
plus , when that's all done , you only get an unfocused preview of the subject in which you are taking the picture of  .
for high speed subjects , this just doesn't cut it  .
if i is part of the canon development team for this camera i would be embarrassed to market this as one of its key features for the rebel xs  .
the image quality is poor when in low light as the camera only comes equipped with a 1600 iso  .
the noise reduction is decent , but does not match sony's alpha series i know that this is only a entry level camera , but i expected more from a company like canon  .
this camera would be great for the amateur users who wants to upgrade from ps digital cameras and advance a little further into photography .
generic error 99 message after only 1 month  .
i could resolve the error by pulling the battery , but it would only return if the camera is powered off  .
also had mirror flapping around like crazy sent into canon , 5 weeks now and canon is waiting for parts  .
apparently they do not keep parts on hand at their repair centre customer service has been unacceptable .
i do not recommend this product  .
i have been in touch with canon�s rep in the us and canon does not honor warranties on products outside the us or canada there is not such international warranty it�s a lie (those people probably never studied geography)  .
, even if the products are purchased in the us , there is no support at all  .
be very careful with canon�s rebel xs , and read users forums before buying canon  .
err99 , err99 , err99 on a brand new 599usd camera  .
it worked well for a couple months , but now it quit working  .
no screen , no pictures  .
i'm dealing with canon's customer service now , but i've searched and found multiple instances of this same problem on the internet  .
i would buy a nikon if i could do it over again .
VERY GOOD CAMERA FOR A AVERAGE USER. NO FUSS BUT NO LSD.; NO LSD. TOO LITTLE FOR THE MONEY.
SLR, lots of features, great photo quality.; Too big &#38; cumbersome. I always leave it behind.
Best Image Quality, Very Fast and good performance, Good night photos; Small Size with less grip
Photo quality, features for the price point, simple menus, lots of available lens options; Kit glass isn't the best
Decent picture. Menu system and buttons easy to understand and navigate. Grip is uncomfortable.; Even though this
Very good Lenses; Terrible after sale service, ZERO international warranty, error 99 continuosly everytime you turn on the camera and after the first shot. Zero Canon�s QA,
it takes beautiful pictures easy to use light with right lens combination; nothing i see no faults
If you hurry, you might be able to purchase this camera at Circuit City's going out of business sale.; I bought this camera for under $400 before taxes!
IS works great and can manage shots 1/6th of a second or even slower hand held.; Broke down after 1 months use.
Great pictures, great controls, easy to use; live view isnt that good however... who needs live view with a dslr???
Picture quality is by far the best I have ever seen in a digital camera even after playing with my brothers Nikon SLR where he paid over a $1200 for 3 years ago, I did over pay for mine $799.00 but I love the camera espsically after owning a kodakeas; over paid but thats not the camera's fault : )
The menu is intuitive enough. The buttons are in the right place. The navigation is smooth. Camera body is made in Japan.; The kit lens is junk. It makes people look uglier than a decent point and shoot. This lens doesn't do well in low light, some point and shoot camera can actually do better in low light.
a) Inexpensive to buy and well-built.. b) TONS of used lenses and accessories on the market .; (All minor cons.). a) No video mode.. b) Fewer autofocus points than XSi.. c) No AF-assist beam.. d) Might be overwhelming (like an DSLR) to a new user.
* Picture Quality is crisp and clear. * Color saturation is just right. * The IS makes almost every shot a perfect shot. * Easy to learn - Easy to use. * RAW is a +. * Price is +++; There are no CONS that i can think of
The Camera has intuitive controls with dedicated buttons for almost any option. This means less time trying to navigate thru menus, more time taking pictures. Vibrant screen; MegaPixel count close to on market point-and-shoots, flash can be sluggish to recharge if taking a series of quick shots
Well priced and a steady entry level camera. Has a nice 3 frames per second feature, decent battery life and 10 megapixels. Quick start-up.; Only has a 7 point auto-focus system and the picture quality seems a little on the poor side. The grip is formed in a way which after a long period of holding, will cramp your hand.
picture quality is one of the things i like about this camera. although price is not the lowest among entry-level dslr, it is still affordable.; exposure can be a little difficult to set on bright lights..
The Canon Xs is a great camera. The menu and navagation systems are great, and the my menu option can be a life saver. Also, the battery life is very long. The image quality and shutter speed are very good. I give it a 5/5.; I cannot find any so far (I've owned it for two months now and used it frequently).
Wide variety of features yet easy to learn and operate.. Small enough to pack yet large enough to be comfortable in the hand.. Inexpensive yet gives you pro-quality results. Accepts wide array of Canon lenses and accessories; Ok, yes, feels a little cheap to the touch. But I've yet to see a review complaining about it breaking.
The quality picture is amazing. The Menu is User friendly and the body is easy to grasp.; Could be a little bit annoying when taking pictures in live mode, but anyway its great when using with an tripod and a remote control.
- cheap. - small (good for backpackers, not pocketable though). - light. - fast. - easy to use after P&#38;S camera. - good AF; - small (ain't happy about the grip, in fact only 4/3 have worse grip). - light (ain't exaclty stable with telelenses). - advanced user will need Av, Tv modes instead of presets. - ISO limited to 1600. - smallish viewfinder. - feels like a cheapo in hands
Great picture quality. Lightweight and small. Easy menu navigation. My Menu settings are wonderful. Good price.; Wish it had a 3" LCD on the back, but I can't complain too much about that. There are some menu items that don't allow you to use all four directional buttons, but that is hardly anything to blink an eye at.
Great Photo quality, great metering, has everything you need to start up and get shooting and you dont need no 1000$ setup to make your images look good this will start you off just fine.; Would have like to see the infrared on this as well as audio and video, though there is a video hack floating around in the cloud.
Price, kit lens, bracketing feature (for HDR images), decent flash, nice screen (both in clarity and functions it shows), very robust feature settings, lightweight, easy to use out of the box, battery life, this camera won't be obsolete for 20+ years; no date stamp on images, only RAW+ large image no RAW +m or small, smallish grip, big learning curve to exploit the features, strobe flash for autofocus in dark rooms, owners manual could be better
Everything. This camera takes excellent, high resolution photographs (3888X2592). It's incredibly easy to use, and comes with a variety of add-ons. This maybe the baby brother of the XSi, but it's a perfect camera for most peoples needs.; The fact that there is no video-capture mode was a little disappointing, and only being a 10MP DSLR was a little 'bleh'. But unless you are a major photographer you won't have a need of more MP, but if you do, I'd recommend getting the XSi or higher.
The auto focus system works well and all the controls and settings are easily accessible. Image quality is great for its price range and the upgraded IS lens and the extended battery life from the XSI has a good life span.; The auto focus system isn't to big of a deal but would be nice to have a littler larger then 7 points. It isn't a good camera for someone who is just going to keep it on auto settings. Live view mode is only on programmable settings and it is hidden
