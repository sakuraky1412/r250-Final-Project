i/LS thought/VBD the/DT castle/NN was/VBD interesting/JJ ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP some/DT important/JJ things/NNS to/TO note/VB :/: the/DT rickety/JJ elevator/NN is/VBZ operated/VBN by/IN the/DT hotel/NN receptionist/NN ,/, so/RB be/VB prepared/VBN to/TO wait/VB ./.

i/FW believe/VBP there/EX 's/VBZ no/DT one/NN on/IN duty/NN after/IN 7/CD or/CC 8/CD ,/, so/RB stairs/NNS are/VBP the/DT best/JJS option/NN ./.

if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP physically/RB challenged/VBN ,/, you/PRP 're/VBP best/JJS off/RP somewhere/RB else/RB ./.

i/LS had/VBD a/DT water/NN view/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD quite/RB nice/JJ ,/, but/CC be/VB aware/JJ that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT air/NN conditioning/NN in/IN the/DT rooms/NNS ./.

it/PRP was/VBD cool/JJ at/IN the/DT time/NN we/PRP visited/VBD ,/, but/CC in/IN the/DT summer/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB untenable/JJ for/IN me/PRP ./.

all/DT the/DT rooms/NNS are/VBP small/JJ ./.

the/DT castle/NN was/VBD renovated/VBN and/CC occupied/VBN by/IN monks/NNS at/IN some/DT point/NN ,/, so/RB do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB to/TO have/VB large/JJ rooms/NNS and/CC opulent/JJ furnishings/NNS ./.

the/DT furniture/NN is/VBZ second/JJ hand/NN ,/, at/IN best/JJS ,/, although/IN the/DT sheets/NNS were/VBD nice/JJ ;/: the/DT towels/NNS are/VBP old/JJ ./.

the/DT trash/NN basket/NN had/VBD not/RB been/VBN emptied/VBN before/IN my/PRP$ check-in/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT was/VBD the/DT only/JJ area/NN that/WDT needed/VBD attention/NN ./.

the/DT bathroom/NN fixtures/NNS were/VBD also/RB old/JJ ,/, but/CC they/PRP functioned/VBD ./.

i/LS had/VBD a/DT closet/NN -LRB-/-LRB- no/DT hangers/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- but/CC no/DT bureau/NN ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ sister/NN did/VBD n't/RB even/RB have/VB a/DT closet/NN at/IN all/DT in/IN her/PRP$ room/NN ./.

i/LS thought/VBD the/DT rooms/NNS were/VBD overpriced/VBN for/IN the/DT comfort/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB a/DT walking/VBG distance/NN from/IN the/DT cute/JJ town/NN ,/, so/RB you/PRP 'd/MD only/RB stay/VB there/RB if/IN manresa/NN castle/NN was/VBD on/IN your/PRP$ ``/`` to/TO do/VB list/NN ''/'' ./.

my/PRP$ ratings/NNS are/VBP for/IN the/DT hotel/NN portion/NN only/RB ./.

i/LS do/VBP n't/RB know/VB why/WRB trip/NN advisor/NN does/VBZ n't/RB yet/RB have/VB a/DT review/NN page/NN for/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD n't/RB open/VB for/IN our/PRP$ stay/NN at/IN the/DT property/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD a/DT disappointment/NN -LRB-/-LRB- especially/RB because/IN i/FW 'd/MD asked/VBN specifically/RB about/IN its/PRP$ hours/NNS at/IN the/DT time/NN i/FW booked/VBN our/PRP$ room/NN because/IN i/FW 'd/MD heard/VBN such/JJ good/JJ reviews/NNS about/IN it/PRP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, but/CC we/PRP ended/VBD up/RP an/DT extra/JJ day/NN at/IN the/DT palace/NN hotel/NN in/IN port/NN townsend/NN ,/, so/IN we/PRP went/VBD back/RB to/TO the/DT castle/NN for/IN an/DT evening/NN meal/NN on/IN a/DT wednesday/NNP when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD open/JJ ./.

we/PRP were/VBD underwhelmed/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ rooms/NNS at/IN the/DT castle/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT restaurant/NN was/VBD fabulous/JJ ./.

we/PRP opted/VBD to/TO eat/VB in/IN the/DT bar/NN area/NN to/TO get/VB a/DT window/NN table/NN -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC i/FW would/MD have/VB loved/VBN to/TO not/RB have/VB had/VBD the/DT tv/NN on/IN -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, but/CC the/DT dining/NN room/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN my/PRP$ first/JJ choice/NN as/IN its/PRP$ furnishings/NNS are/VBP quite/RB genteel/JJ ./.

our/PRP$ meals/NNS were/VBD perfect/JJ ./.

i/LS 'd/MD recommend/VB the/DT chicken/NN marsala/NN ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ sister/NN 's/POS entree/FW was/VBD also/RB perfectly/RB prepared/VBN ./.

our/PRP$ meals/NNS were/VBD prefaced/VBN by/IN a/DT bread/NN course/NN complete/JJ with/IN three/CD different/JJ butters/NNS :/: gorgonzola/NN ,/, garlic-herb/NN ,/, and/CC regular/JJ butter/NN ./.

the/DT gorgonzola/NN was/VBD aromatic/JJ and/CC just/RB wonderful/JJ ./.

a/DT diner/NN at/IN a/DT nearby/JJ table/NN took/VBD a/DT conniption/NN fit/NN because/IN she/PRP said/VBD something/NN tasted/VBD moldy/JJ and/CC she/PRP asked/VBD the/DT server/NN to/TO take/VB it/PRP away/RB ./.

blue/JJ cheese/NN ,/, duh/NN ./.

the/DT server/NN did/VBD n't/RB educate/VB her/PRP$ that/WDT blue/JJ cheese/NN is/VBZ moldy/JJ ,/, as/RB are/VBP all/DT cheeses/NNS ,/, which/WDT may/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT disservice/NN to/TO the/DT diner/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP certainly/RB enjoyed/VBD the/DT appetizer/NN ./.
