this resort is associated with seaquest divers , which is on the same premises ( a long-standing and great dive operation offering high level of service to every level of diver experience ) .
i had last been to the resort several years ago , and there have been some changes since .
the level of customer service remains excellent .
the room are fairly basically furnished , but perfectly clean , and serviceable .
( a previous reviewer reported that a guest had left behind bed bugs in his room - this is how they arrive - but there was absolutely no sign of any kind of infestation in my room , and bed-linen was spotless ; they have obviously dealt with the problem ) .
i had a 'deluxe ' room which was traditional , rustic .
very efficient and quiet aircon , hot water shower , but a bit slow in operation , no tv , but this could be a blessing to some as the noise level in the resort was nice and low ! !
wifi works around the restaurants and the pool areas , but happened to work in my room too .
one new feature is that the main restaurant and bar is now at the beach , and that works very well , although i felt for the kitchen porter who had to bring food down from the kitchen , some way from the beach !
the food was overall pretty good , although the italian dishes on offer unsurprisingly lacked a bit of mediterranean flair , ( especially the saucing for pasta dishes ) , but all . . .
