hd video in my pocket that i can take to the pool with my son or on the golf course and not worry if it rains  .
it's nice to be able to record life's moments without carrying around a camera bag .
if you do not mind having 0001 file all over again (after deleting previous ones on camera)    go for it  .
i't annoying , but otherwise i'm happy with mine .
if you are looking for a solid , well priced , easy to use video camera this is the one to get .
i spend my time outdoors hiking and in the mountains  .
i have had many cameras but this one takes the cake  .
i attach a wrist strap to it and im ready to go bottom line is this  .
for $150 this camera is amazing  .
perfect for posting to facebook or sharing family videos  .
i already have about 10 vidoes on facebook and several people have commented on the quiality if you are looking for a compact hd camera for the trail , camping , pool , or beach this is the camera for you  .
overall it's the best on the market  .
better pics than the flip models and higher capactiy (up to 32gb sd card)  .
i have a 16gb sdhc card in mine and have hours of great video  .
the playsport has a wider viewing angle than the zi8 so fits more in the picture  .
also , the mic seems to be more sensitive and picks up voices/sounds better  .
the screen is smaller , but that's fine with me ; just makes it more portable  .
this is the best $150 i've spent  .
if you go diving , make sure to attach something that floats to the camera so it does not sink below the 10ft depth limit .
bottom line for the price , and for what i need , this is a great camera  .
i can take pictures or video easily and on the fly  .
and with three kids , on the fly happens a lot  .
i wish i could get the editing software that is on the disk onto my computer so that i can edit this stuff , but i will figure it out i guess  .
and i is unable to upload straight to facebook  .
but i could upload to youtube and send a link to my facebook family this is an early christmas present from my husband so i could capture the holidays  .
and i cannot wait to get a chance to really do that  .
i was not expecting a $600 camcorder btw  .
i expected a small easy to use take with me device and i got it .
i is happy with my sd camera and this thing looks great  .
i have a brand new led lit vizio 55 inch 108p tv and the video from this looks like i shot it  .
i haven't played with it too much , but wondering how i can get that video onto a disk and play it at that resolution for sharing and archive  .
vids get big quickly i've owned everything from canon l2 (the big camera not the point and shoot) to the xl1 and everything inbetween  .
they just never got used for every day shooting , too big  .
even the mid sized are a burden  .
this one actually is in my pocket all the time  .
ready to catch whatever  .
moreover its far more discrete  .
worlds above all the current cell phone cameras and at a price that makes it an easy purchase because your carryon is too full for your regular camcorder i haven't used it in all situations or light sources , but it so far seems to handle bright light and indoor with the shades open just fine  .
i hear its low light is poor , but , unless it says low light on the package , you can assume it stinks , and even then , sometimes when it does say low light  .
seems rock solid , though the water tight seals do take an extra bit of care  .
i've had a water proof olympus with the same type seals and doors for years and it's always maintained its integrity gotta love the sd card slot vs sony's sticks  .
i'm up to my ears in sd cards , they go in just about everything i own , just like your house  .
so i've always got a couple gig sitting around  .
that said , 1 8gb memory card shoots well longer than your battery will last  .
5hrs at 1080p and 3  .
5 at wvga  .
which is right in there in the 15    30 min per gb typical of digital media the 60 fps video actually ends up letterboxing your screen to up the frame rate , but it does give you great slow    mo capability  .
i tried the flip and flip minio and they were similar quality pic , worse stabilization , and not waterproof  .
the big stupid usb flip out is asking to break the camera off as well  .
it just does not suit my computer work space , though i appreciate the lack of need for a cable  .
but its a standard miniusb cable , so i've always got one for charging my phone anyway i've actually got 2 of these now , as i cannot pry the other out of my wife's hands , and they're practically a dime a dozen , how can you go wrong .
for the price of this camera it is very hard to complain about anything this unit represents a great value easy to use , beautiful pq , and a tough package this is something that kodak does very very well flip is in the dust against this little gem .

v  iqtacobadc0 camera worked great for what i needed it to do  .
skiing videos were very good and water skiing videos were very good on hdtv but i think youtube quality is not quite as good  .
the video editing software worked great  .
i love this camera but would like to see later versions offer a flash .
better build quality than flip , better feature set and better quality video and stills  .
included software is by arcsoft and is leaps and bounds beyond the flip software which i considered to be a joke  .
having the storage on any sd card makes it easy as they are cheap and easy to find  .
this also makes transferring videos super easy  .
i'm very pleased with the ergonomics , the ease of use , especially when switching between video and camera modes (e  .
, 5 mp stills , 720p , 720p @60 fps , 1080p)  .
there are different lens filters for water , dark , and indoor environments  .
takes good stills indoors even without a flash  .
buying an extra sd card is cheap , and i found extra li    ion batters for just under $3  .
00 bucks each  .
tried the flip , was not impressed , took a chance on the kodak , absolutely loved it  .
great bargain at $129       it even includes a mini hdmi cable to hook up directly to your hdtv , or standard cables for sdtv's  .
would buy this product again .
so nice to capture my kids and friends in action with out asking anyone to hold on , let me get my camera  .
just pull it out and simotaniously turn on and push record  .
no more bags and straps  .
great deal and functional  .
definatly has the most dextarity of all the pocket cameras .
this product is nearly perfect considering the price and quality  .
people need to understand what they are buying and stop giving bad ratings and nitpicking a 150 dollar camcorder  .
the zi8 is so well received last year , and this is the exact same image sensor , only the camera is cheaper because there is no external mic jack and also no macro mode  .
but this will take the exact same quality video as the zi8  .
i is one day away from picking up a zi8 for a trip to the grand canyon next month    and came across a post mentioning the zx3  .
so i looked it up and is glad it did  .
i saved a few bucks and alos got a more rugged camera all in all , you have to understand what you are buying    a pocket camcorder that takes very good qaulity video    better than your cell phone camera , and it is easier to carry around than a conventional camcorder  .
great buy at 150  .
00 , i got an 8gb memory card from amazon for only 15 bucks  .
the only hangup is the eis    i have shaky hands and sometimes it does come across in the videos  .
hopefully a firmware fix will come out soon  .
this thing goes from being off to recording in about 3 seconds so it's going to catch whatever you are wanting to without you being stuck waiting for it to power on the quality is excellent for what it is  .
it will not disappoint  .
i own a dslr camera , and the last thing i want is two bulky pieces of equipment to lug around on vacation  .
this is great and if you are not a professional , this will catch those memorable moments and they will look great when you reminisce for years to come .
i got the playsport with a bundle deal of an 8gb class 6 mem card from amazon for $139  .
added extra battery/charger , case , 2 mini gorilla    type tripods , and the wireless remote  .
a local tv station has already used some video i shot of a house fire just around the corner from where i live  .
it is getting dark and i shot it in 720p/60 fps  .
if you're making a spec trailer or something , or just a hobbyist , great little camcorder  .
i plan to mount it on sailboats to get action footage of the cockpit during races , and to use it kayaking out on cape cod this summer  .
people think i'm holding an iphone or something , usually  .
not only does kodak give you all the cables you'll ever need , the thing boots up in about 1 second and is shooting as soon as you hit the button  .
i did have to rma 1st one i got , there were a few dead (white) pixels in the middle of the sensor apparently , since i watched the video on several different monitors and the artifact is there on all of them  .
however , amazon sent out the replacement about an hour after i went online to process the return  .
this is not an indestructible camera  .
it's waterproof  .
to 10 ft  .
so , would be great to take on your snorkeling trip in hawaii , etc  .
, or to a shallow beach  .
i think kodak really hit a homerun with this  .
if i was not going to use it outdoors/on the water , i'd have gotten the zi8 for the external mic input and some fancier features  .
but the playsport is a winner in my book , and i'm a cranky geek and hard to impress .
way better than the other product i've used  .
bought this at sears along with the 2 year warranty and have been happy except for battery life  .
i took it skiing today on an epic powder day 31 inches of new snow  .
take a look    .

buy it try it and get a new one next week  .
rukiya belagam  .
compared to other products in this segement this is probably the best device  .
however if you plan to use this in active environments that will require you to move around a lot while shooting this may not be the device for you  .
any movement of the camcorder causes the image to pixelate until the camera returns to a semi stationary position .
if you cannot afford a better quality video camera , and can learn to create the content you want , initially , this camera will allow a reasonable short range event sharing platform i don't blog , nor do i use twitter , or facebook  .
i only have a cell phone for making phone calls  .
i do post videos of my dogs to youtube , but that's about my only activity that this camera supports  .
the fact that it readily fits my pocket , and it's ease of operation are the main advantages  .
conditionally high quality video is nice when it's available i wanted a pocket video camera to edit the video output maybe mix it with some that i already have from my other cameras , and burn it to dvds on my windows computers  .
the output from my video editors using playsports mov files hasn't been acceptable , but my biggest surprise is the playsports files didn't work well with my mac , either i haven't had it a week , yet , so i'm hoping to find a reasonable editing solution but i think another more expensive video camera lies in my future  .
for now , i am using it as a pocketable heart warmer , as i capture some great moments on daily walks with my dogs my feelings about this camera are mixed  .
the potential is there to capture attractive looking video , and i have had some fun with it but when i want to do more , it has not supported my efforts , so far  .
i intend to keep working on it , until i purchase the next video camera  .
i've pretty well worn out my digital8 camcorder .
i had a flip ultra hd which shoots at one setting , 1280x720x30 frames per second  .
i wanted the 60 frames per second rate (for smoother motion) and the underwater feature of the kodak playsport  .
the kodak playsport image is much crisper than the flip , has better contrast and better color accuracy in low light  .
the low light sensitivity is very good compared to the flip  .
the playsport feels solid and rugged in the hand , but it is a bit more complicated to use than the simple , one setting flip  .
the kodak has a 5 megapixel still image setting , something the flip cannot do at all  .
stills shot in bright light are incredible , with crisp , clear distortion free image quality right out to the four corners  .
there is no visible chromatic aberration (color fringing around objects)  .
even my nikon slr's kit lens had some of this , but the kodak doesn't shooting at the 1080 resolution produces a very sharp image , but at 30 frames per second , it has a staccato look to it when objects move  .
the image stabilizer works , but very minimally  .
shooting video at the 720    60 frame mode yields less sharpness , but the motion is very smooth  .
on the dvd you make from this camcorder , you wo not see the sharpness advantage of the 1080 mode , because dvd's are only 480 anyway  .
but you will see the smoother motion of the 60 frame rate , so i recommend shooting at 1280x720x60 mode  .
for some reason , this also provides a more wide angle view which is desirable for scenic outdoor shots and tight indoor spaces the weak link is the lack of an optical zoom lens  .
if you zoom digitally , you lose sharpness  .
you might as well capture the full wide image and zoom in during post production on your pc or mac  .
the view screen is very hard to see outdoors in sunlight , an even indoors it looks chalky and dim  .
it's just the viewfinder that looks that way  .
the recorded images are fantastic  .
they exceed the quality of the new sony sd camcorders by quite a bit , and those cost double what the kodak costs the real disappointment comes in the lack of quality control for the imaging chips  .
the first playsport i bought had a dead pixel , which shows up as a fixed white spot on the image  .
not wanting to return it until i had another unit , i bought a second playsport before returning the first one  .
i went through three more units that all head dead pixels , one unit having as many as five of them  .
kodak finally sent a replacement , but it is a refurbished unit that had scratches and scuffs on the view screen and on the back of the camera  .
there is a smudge print on the inside of the lens where obviously a technician touched it while working on it  .
it can not be cleaned without completely dis    assembling the camcorder  .
my fear is the waterproof seal would be compromised by disassembling the unit in short , the design , build quality and image quality far exceed what you'd expect for 150 dollars  .
it's even better than many standard big name 300 dollar camcorders  .
unfortunately , the quality control of the imaging device and the kodak customer service fall short  .
i appreciate their fast service , but they never solved the problem  .
sending me a refurbished unit in place of my brand new one day old camcorder is something i find unacceptable unless they also refund the difference in value of a new unit verses a used one  .

i am not satisfied at all  .
i would return to kodak if possible .
don't know if the store i got them at maybe had a bad shipment , but it is pretty sorry quality for two to have the same problem  .
usually a camera might develop one after a year or so , but each one had at least 4 right out of the box  .
back to the store they go  .
so if you do not mind hot pixels , then i would highly recommend you get the camera .
i is very excited when i bought this video camera  .
full    hd video on a compact , waterproof , shock    resistant package , it seemed like the ideal camera  .
until i found out that it only records up to 1 hour , 36 minutes of video (assuming you have a 4gb card or larger) , because battery life is so bad that you cannot even record for 2 hours indoor video looks bad  .
the best way to describe it is like taking video from a cellphone at 320x240 resolution and then trying to display it on a 1920x1080 hdtv  .
all that pixelation and compression artifacts are magnified when you try to view the playsport's supposedly hd video on an hdtv  .
note , this only happens with indoor videos  .
videos taken outdoors on bright days look great you could take 5mp still pictures but do not bother taking them indoors , as the shots will come out darker than what you saw on the lcd preview screen  .
needless to say , i returned this camera to the store after four days of owning it  .
it is not good enough  .
would not buy another kodak product  .
when are they going to stop putting miniature 4    way and center select user button control interface  .
got to be the worst user controller invention ever  .
looking at the flimsy design , i don't think the unit is capable of keeping out water as stated so i wouldn't even try reading other reviews , i thought kodak may be onto something , but my quickly broken unit quickly dismissed that hope  .
stick with japanese canon , nikon brands and you wo not likely be disappointed .
Price, Full 1080, Waterproof; Poor video quality if not on tripod. 5 MP still images very soft
Great Images. Solid build quality. Usable under water. Multiple video formats - 1920x1080x30, 1280x720x60, 1280x720x30, 720x480x30. Decent sound quality.; No optical zoom. Dead pixels in three out of four units.
Great price. Comes with all needed accessories, even an HDMI cable. Use of the included software is optional.; Awful battery life. Poor indoor performance.
Nice form factor, great picture quality, easy to use.. Under water shooting is alot of fun, and great pq there as well.; can't really think of any
Really easy to use. buttons are perfect for my big thumbs and its water tight; Would like a light, and EIS could be better
Compared to other products like this one is probably the best device.; It does not take the best video. Its really more fun then for a good vid.
Easy to use.; broke after 1 use. Contacted Kodak on-line support who said to sent it to Precision Repair which I did. (cost me around $20 in shipping cost.) Camera couldn0t be repaired so Kodak is sending me a "re-conditioned" camera to replace my new one.
Lightweight and easy to carry. Cheap. High quality video. Waterproof. Shock proof. Fast. Easy to see screen in sunlight. Connects easily with your pc or mac, and facebook.; A bigger view screen would beThe digital zoom could be a little faster
Same exact camera as the Zi8, minus the external mic jack and macro mode.. Waterproof to 3M. Very good quality videos, tested 720p/60fps on 42" TV and it looks great.; EIS too wimpy for my shaky hands.. Low light videos are bad(but so are any other pocket camcorder's)
Makes good when you can see what you are recording.; You can't see the screen in the sun at all. It is advertised as a sport camera, but it is almost impossible to see anything on the screen in the sun. I even bought a filter at my expense (this was the only possible solution offerred by Kodak)
nice colours, sharp, good quality video and still pictures, small so you can carry it everywhere and be ready for "Kodak moments". Waterproof so ideal for the beach or rainy weather. Easy to use.; digital zoom is useless, file numbering system also.
Have had this video camera for about a month. It takes great video and is extremely easy to use. the screen is a decent size and the resolution is superb for a camera under $200 dollars.; Nothing I have found. Maybe a 2.5 inch display but I can live with the 2.0 size.
Cheap alternative and just a small step above camera phones for recording videos.; Very crude user interface; need to look up manual on how to really use the limited number of buttons. My unit actually broke after taking videos and not even being submerged - this says it all in terms of Kodak quality.
Wide viewing angle on lens, good quality picture, better sound quality than prior models, more portable and rugged! I came from the Zi8 and got my Playsport this week. Small and portable, and it feels very comfortable in the hands.; The things this is missing that the Zi8 had are (1) USB plug (which I don't think is a big deal since I have SD card readers in my computers) (2) macro mode (which I never really used on the Zi8 and (3) external mic (I never used this either).
Always there, its iPhone sized.. True HD quality, looks like real life on my 55 inch 1080p TV. Removable memory and battery.. Records in standard (mp4?) encoding. No crazy compressed stuff that won't play. Works with mac/win whatever; Have to be pretty steady to maintain a steady pic.. Picky but, can't easily find spare batteries or a separate charger.. Included software is ok, but only works with winblows.. Field of view is ok, but of course, standard compact issues with zoom.
The image quality is very good. The product feels very solid in your hand and the navigation is easy. Has a very good field of view also. The camera would be great..if...See Cons; The only con I have about this cam is that I have now had two of them and they have both had hot pixels. Easy way to see if your Kodak has it...Shoot a black background or just in a dark room...you see hot white spots in the picture, you got them.
I have shot all my videos in the 720 60fps and they are excellent. I love the portability and waterproof features...takes great video and photos under water. It shoots a great HD picture and easy to share to youtube, facebook, etc.; No optical zoom...I wouldn't suggest using the digital zoom. Don't buy this as your digital camera. It's an HD video camera that happens to take pictures too...no flash.
When held perfectly still in shaded or overcast daylight, this vid-cam does a reasonable job. Avoid bright sun and low light, to capture video output that is clear and well saturated. The price won't stop me from stepping up to a better camera.; It only took about a day to understand I would want a better video camera than the Playsport. I only paid $120 for it, but I find that I'm taking the same video content repeatedly. EIS isn't very helpful, and advanced editing prospects are dismal.
It is small. I can fit it in my pocket and take it with me. It is waterproof so the kids can't destroy it. It takes great video. I did research before my purchase and based on the reviews this was my choice.; The button to turn on can be a pain. But I chalk that up to I need to get used to it. I have been unable to get the software to load on my computer. I found this is a common problem as I searched for an answer. Haven't found it yet.
Ergonomically pleasing. Waterproof to 10 feet and drop-proof to 1 meter. Excellent construction quality, rubberized plastic all around. Easy use, easy to switch modes between camera and camcorder. Had an Flip before, the Kodak is much better.; The inclusion of a rechargeable battery may be considered a plus, but bthe fact that it is proprietary and not able to be powered by AA's off the shelf is a little bit of a drawback. Battery life has been fine. I found extra batteries for $2.50
Got a Playsort in May. 720p 60/fps is the mode to use for great looking video. Even performs well in low light. Comes with all the cables you'll ever need. Super easy to use, good battery life even with the EIS turned on.; What do you expect for $149? Digital zoom, but still not bad if you're subtle. Proprietary USB port a bit of a drag. Wind noise can be an issue. Would be nice if it came with a memory card but it doesn. Would have also liked a case.
