this was our first time at the hotel and visited in march 2015 .
the service before we arrived was good as the hotel communicates with you about the inclusive treatments and these can be booked in advance ( this is recommended as all guests have the inclusive treatments as part of the package ) .
when we arrived - check in was good and we upgraded our room to a deluxe oceanfront room and the room and the view across the ocean was great .
the hotel has so many activities that you can do if you want but can resist if you also want !
there are activities starting from 6-7 am in the morning and they all finish about 5pm .
we took part in morning stretch classes , boxercise , spoga ( spinning & yoga ) , water and beach volleyball , walking , golf and we had a treatment each day - massages , hydrotherapy massages etc - sheer bliss .
there is a gym but we did not use this .
there are choices of where to eat - the food was good - not exceptional - but fine for the time we were there .
i came back from this hotel feeling relaxed and fitter than before i went - but did n't feel like any of the activities were a slog - there were good .
apart from the activities , time was spent on reading , sleeping , playing pool and chatting to other guests at the hotel .
the holiday is not cheap but . . .

the holiday is not cheap but when you take into account the all inclusive nature of the holiday ( food , drinks and activities ) - then it is worth it .
