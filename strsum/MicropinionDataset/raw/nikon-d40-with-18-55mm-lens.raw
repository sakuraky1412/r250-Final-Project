$$;
Pros:. Lightweight, relatively fast, easy learning curve and customizable. 
Cons:. Slow to focus sometimes. 
Summary:. I dearly love this camera - takes great shots and is easily customizable. I can use it as an amateur on auto and as a semi pro in manual.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to learn, great quality, amazing for the money, ultra light + small = ultra portable, incredible battery life, best thing I have ever spent my money on, really. 
Cons:. I wish the D40 came standard with the VR version of the 18-55mm, but no cons with the camera itself. (well I guess if I had to choose, I would have liked to see Auto Exposure Bracketing). and I guess some people would not like having only 6MP. 
Summary:. I bought this camera a year and a half ago and I have loved it ever since. It is my first DSLR, and I didn't have any problems learning how to use it. I have never had a problem with it, even though I have not always treated it nicely. I have used it in the rain and in snow, and in sub-freezing temperatures. Despite filling with condensation at certain points and even getting it pretty wet, it still works perfectly.. As for battery life, I once went on a two day trip where I was using the camera constantly. I took more than 1000 photos, and I was constantly looking at all the photos I had taken since there were train rides between destinations. And with 2-3 days of literally straight use, I never even had to switch to my spare battery. A year and a half later, the same batteries impress me equally.. Also, I don't think it's a big deal to have only 6MP unless you were planning on making giant posters with your photos. Any amateur photographer will have no problem with this. In fact, I think it's a good thing since it saves me lots of hard drive space.. Summary: Best camera for the money, hands-down.. 

$$;
Pros:. it light it wont hurt your neck compared to other dslr, long battery life, user friendly menu, comfortable hand grip, fast sync speed. 
Cons:. none, this is the best entry level dslr. 
Summary:. pixel size doesn't matter, it only matter if your doing large prints like giant billboards. i recommend buying 18-200mm lens, for more detailed review visit kenrockwell.com. 

$$;
Pros:. Manual focusing and zoom, picture size and quality, trust in the name. 
Cons:. None really, except perhaps the cost of additional lenses. 
Summary:. I am a college sophomore studying photojournalism and finally took the money dive and bought a Nikon. I've always wanted one, just because of the name itself. Now that I own one, I am very impressed. I am only in my entry classes, but have already found so many neat ways to work the camera and get effects that one only thought was possible if using photoshop. If you have it, and aren't satisfied, you need to learn how to use it! If you are thinking of purchasing it, definitely do. It will be confusing at first but when you learn how to play with it and the many ways it can be used, you'll be so glad you took the leap. Highly recommend!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image quality, friendly user interface, compact size,. 
Cons:. i would like to have seen a live view like the comparable Cannon. 
Summary:. this is my first Dslr and im in love. i find it very user friendly and easy to understand, the menu is very easy to get through.. i would have like to see a live view like the cannon but im very happy with image quality. 6 megapixles is plenty for what i want to do.. All and all a very good camera for the price. i would recommend this to any one who wants more than they can get from there "point and shoot". 

$$;
Pros:. Light, easy to use. Forget megapixels. This camera, set to auto ISO, shoots great without flash in almost any light. Good enlargements to 20x30. I leave my D200 home, using the D40 with the 18-200 VR lens, unless faster burst speed is required.. 
Cons:. Equipment snobs won't take you seriously. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality excellent, very user friendly, lightweight, easy transfer, overall great camera. 
Cons:. For the novice as I am the menu on screen is a bit confusing. 
Summary:. For the person upgrading from a point and shoot to SLR this is the camera!. 

$$;
Pros:. I've bought and sent back 4 different cameras until I bought the Nikon D40. I know what a digital camera should do and the Nikon D40 fulfills all of my needs and then some. From 1 to 10. Ease of use. 10. Picture quality. 10.. 
Cons:. None. Of course if you are a professional photographer you might have a different opinion but with this camera you don't have all the bells and whistles to deal with but you get professional qulaity pictures.. 
Summary:. Get the wide angle and telephoto lens. A must.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, picture quality, price!. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. I researched cameras for about a month before choosing the D40. I bought mine at a large camera shop chain and got a fantastic deal, getting the additional lens as well as dvd's, case and all kinds of coupons for free services as well as a "free" printer. This camera is just amazing. As a complete beginner to camera's and the art of taking pictures, I've already managed to take AMAZING pictures!. The D40 is lightweight which makes it just a joy to use if you have back or neck problems. It fits quite nicely in your hands so you can work with it for long periods of time without discomfort.. The controls are well laid out and so easy to use. The software that came with the camera is decent. I also got Nikon DVD's with mine which were really helpful. I almost feel like a pro already!. The battery life has been outstanding. I do plan on buying an additional battery in the future but I really think that it's not something you HAVE to have. I've used the camera for really long stretches of time without having to recharge them.. The only downside to the camera (and I really don't think of it as a con) is that you do have to push your face up against the LCD screen to use the viewfinder. As a person of the female gender, I tend to get makeup on the screen. So, I need to clean it quite often. Of course, if you're a manly guy, I suppose you'd get it all sweaty too! In either case, tt would be nice if Nikon included a lens cloth with it.. I just can't say enough about how wonderful this camera is. I have not encountered a single problem with it. It has really helped bring out my creative side as well as record family memories. If you are thinking of taking the plunge, you won't be disappointed with the D40.. 

$$;
Pros:. Build Quality, Performance, value, ease of use, fun camera. 
Cons:. Cannot think of a single thing except the VF doesn't cover the entire image but you have to pay alot more money to get a 100 percent image View finder.. 
Summary:. It was time to move up so I left a wonderful relationship with my Kodak Z612 for this beautiful D40. We were soulmates right out of the box. I do not think there is a finer camera available for this price. Nikon grandslammed this one right out of the old ballpark!. I was in a rush to my first shoot. I had everything set up and running in about 10 mins including threading the neck strap to the cam. Shot 38 frames with stunning results. Then I realized I had the resolution set on the default setting "Basic" Wow, was I blown away. The linear resolution, color quality and saturation, to say nothing of the sharpness even with the kit lens 18mm-55mm f/5.6 on the "basic" (lowest resolution) setting, no less was like, wow!. Yes, you should buy better glass if you find yourself taking more pictures now and want to look even better.. Don't worry a typical serious amateur - semi pro photographer will have $1000-$5000 in camera/s and $20,000 in lenses. You build up towards this level as you learn. It's not just a hobby, it's a lifetime adventure.. Good Shooting!. Rix Rox | The Digital Cameraman | Genesis Studios. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid grips, dials, durable, flexible. 
Cons:. No auto exposure bracketing, flash seems flimsy. 
Summary:. New to SLR, this camera has allowed me to ease into learning SLR techniques. I can point &#38; shoot as I need. The price couldn't be beat with the image quality. The dials, body, hardware seemed more durable than the Canon. Unfortunately auto-exposure bracketing is missing for HDR which is something I wanted to work with. Had I known, I might have leaned towards the Canon more.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality! , ease of use, nice size dslr, perfect. 
Cons:. there is no cons. 
Summary:. This is one great camera. Slow kit lens according to cnet? Hogwash. Where do they get these "reviewers"? Oh, now they want one to think about rating something a 10. Sorry, rare as they may think, this camera is perfect. I am buying a second one for backup.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price and features. 
Cons:. I dont like size for travel. 
Summary:. I really like this camera. I am a beginner into the DSLR world and this is a great camera to start with. price is reasonable. takes very good pictures. well worth it. I know its compace enough to take travelling but i like an ultra-compact to take on vacations.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple Easy to Use. 
Cons:. Only 6 megapixels. 
Summary:. I fit into the demographic Nikon is looking for. I have wanted an SLR since I was young, I just couldn't afford it. So I decided to treat myself a few months ago. But I had to make a rough decision. I could either spend $200 more for the D40x or spend $200 more and get the kit with the extra lens and bag kit. I had to choose between those because unfortunatly I didn't want to wait and spend nearly $450 more for both. I settled with the kit bundled with a bag, two lenses, and the Nikon D40. Needless to say, I adore my camera. This hobby has even allowed for a few paid gigs, which I didn't think was too shabby. Well, case in point; this camera is designed be an introduction to the dSLR world. And it does a phenominal job for what it's designed for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, weight, lens. 
Cons:. none none none. 
Summary:. It amazes me how C-NET continues to get their reviews so wrong. Recommending the D80 over the D40x is so incorrect. I own both the D40, D40x &#38; the D80. Ask any pro photographer and they will tell you to purchase the D40. The D40 is a great camera and is all you need to shoot great photo's. I don't use my D80 anymore because the D40 does everything I need it do. The D40 is faster than the D40x and is $200 cheaper. www.kenrockwell.com is one example of a pro who recommends the D40 over the D40x and even the heavy D80. The price of the D40 is now under $500 and the 18-55mm lens is fantastic. The only item I would recommend as an add is the SB400 Speedlight flash for indoor photos. Side with the Users here who acutally own and use the D40 (not just for 1 hour CNET staff) and get the D40, you won't regret it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the low price and that it has a lot of controls.. 
Cons:. AF only works with AF-S lenses because it doesn't have a motor in the camera. Still, it deserves a 10.. 

$$;
Pros:. Overall a perfect camera. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. A perfect camera, except something that has nothing to do with the camera itself. Have been using film camera and then point&#38;shoot, and can see the different in physical size of the the lens between the two. But now with DSLR, disappoint that the len is more similar with the point&#38;shoot. In optical, len size do make a different.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Image Quality - any mode, any setting, any ISO! Very easy to use, even right out of the box.. 
Cons:. "Auto" is so good you just might never experiment with all that the camera is capable of. (For some, that's not really a bad thing.). 
Summary:. I purchased the D40 in February and have been absolutely floored by its outstanding performance. In my spare time I teach photography classes at a local camera store and have had the opportunity to get a lot of hands testing with all the sub $1000 DSLRs. After reading dozens of others reviews on all the cameras as well as actually shooting and doing test prints on my own, I chose the D40.. I disagree with CNET's reviewer, Lori Grunin, with regards to the speed of the auto focus system of the D40. To date I've taken 3617 shots with my D40 and haven't missed a shot. The excellent speed of the auto focus system showed its strength when I was taking shot after shot of my 3 kids at some local Easter egg hunts this spring. The focus system is both quick and quiet and incredibly accurate. I initially thought that 3 AF points might be a drawback, but it's not. I point the camera, focus, recompose if necessary, and take a great picture. (And I haven't had to adjust any settings to do so.). Probably one the most important capabilities of the camera is its ability to shoot at high ISOs and get usable large prints. I shoot almost as much indoors as I do outdoors, and even with my SB-400 flash, which is the phenomenal by the way, I still need to bump the ISO up to 400 or 800 sometimes. With the D40 my shots look great &#38; grain/noise free. I couldn't get great lower light/high ISO shots that I took when I was considering the Canon &#38; Sony DSLRs.. The absolute best thing about this camera is that you don't have to screw around with settings, and picture styles, and metering options, and dynamic range optimizers and focus modes, and ...all the other stuff you will if you by a D80/XTi/A100/K10D/K100D. As Ken Rockwell says, and credit goes to him - because he said it first, "The camera gets out of the way and lets you take great photos". As a photography instructor, I believe the less time you spend adjusting settings and the more time you spend working on your composition, the better your photos will look.. Those of you deciding between a D40 and a D40x, it's a tough call. I like the D40's 1/500 sec flash sync, I use the SB-400 when I shoot people outdoors, it kills shadows and the fast flash sync allows me to have a shallow depth of field w/o the need for ND filters. If you're trying to decide between the Canon XTi and the D40 (as I have), I actually think the choice become an easier one to make. I choose the D40 over the XTi for the following reasons:. 1. Lower ISO noise at all ISOs.. 2. Faster flash sync.. 3. Auto focus assist light is on the body.. 4. Easier to read menus on the LCD.. 5. Longer battery life. I get about 700 shots a charge; I don't use my pop up flash, but extensively review my photos when I'm not shooting.. 6. Better handgrip. Dear Canon, Change your hand-cramping hand grip.. 7. Better/More Accurate Metering System. I like the exposures of the D40 better.. 8. Spot Metering Ability, and this I do use quite a bit.. 9. It has the Image Retouch Options from the D80; these are both fun and useful.. 10. Excellent low cost accessories. I loved the SB-400 flash (paid $130) from the first time I shot it. I also recently picked up the Nikon AF-S VR 55-200mm zoom lens. I paid $250 for it and it takes tack-sharp photos!. The Nikon D40 is a fantastic shooting camera, that products extremely well exposed, sharp pictures. I love it, I know you will too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Build quality, image quality &#38; ergonomics. 
Cons:. None for me. 
Summary:. I've had the D40 for about three weeks now and have taken about 400 images, which I consider 200 are keepers. In the old days this would have taken me a year or so. This DSLR is not only a great tool for picture taking but a serious production tool as well. The build quality, image quality and ergonomics are all outstanding. I've been into photography since the early 70's and have never been so impressed with a piece of gear as I am with the D40. Just simply go out and buy one - you will not regret it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great AUTO settings w/plenty of manual controls &#38; has many of the D80 features. 
Cons:. As an "entry" level dSLR and even compared to higher priced dSLRs the D40 has no real cons although it does overexpose slighty which is easily compesated for.. 
Summary:. This has fast become my favorite camera out of my other two and more expensive dSLRs (Canon XT and Nikon D80). It's ease of use and great ergonomics (I have lenses that weigh more!) make it a natural fit in my hands. For those of you making the switch from a Point &#38; Shoot you will not be disappointed. The AUTO settings on this camera make taking great pictures a real snap (pun intended). As many of other reviewers have mentioned 6 megapixels is more than most will need and because the D40 Kit lens is so good you will NOT notice any difference between a higher megapixel camera even on larger prints of 8x10 and higher. Also as some have wrongly stated, this is not a downgraded version of the D50 although you do lose some "features" like the an internal focusing motor for non-motorized lenses. This is NOT A BIG DEAL! You can still use your older lenses you'll just have to manually focus.. Other pros:. -SAME image processing engine as on the D80. -SAME large &#38; bright 2.5" LCD as D80. -SAME bright viewfinder as on D80. -SAME image sensor as on D50/D70/D70S. For a MSRP of only $599 this camera will give you many of the same features of its bigger brother the D80 but you won't break the bank.. 

$$;
Pros:. light and compact, good ergonomics, quality feel, good pictures, low price. 
Cons:. autofocus does not work with some older lenses. 
Summary:. The review of Lori Grunin is a disappointment. This is a review of a salesman, not a photographer, most likely a salesman of a different brand (e.g. Canon). I doubt Lori Grunin takes any pictures herself.. "only 6 megapixel" -- It is enough for an entry level camera. I have D200 with 10 megapixels and D40 with 6 megapixel, and I take most pictures with D40 now.. "slow kit lens" -- for the price of the camera ($570) it is an EXCELLENT lens. Canon's expensive cameras (over $1200) includes a worst lens kit than D40.. "no automatic sensor cleaning" -- none of the professional dSLR includes automatic sensor cleaning. Only few of the cheap dSLR includes it, just as a sales point.. "control scheme ban be awkward" - D40 has EXCELLENT (for the price and size) ergonomics, menus and controls. I do not know what she means by that.. "occasionally slow focus" -- I have not seen that. It has only three focus points, but that is a PRO for an entry level simple camera.. Again, the reviewer is most likely a salesman of a different brand.. I give it 10 point since I think it is an excellent camera for the prize.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feather light, low noise at high ISO, fast shutter response. 
Cons:. Its not a D200, but then I don't need a D200. 
Summary:. I had a Nikon D70 and Fujifilm S2Pro. I recently sold the Fujifilm S2Pro as it was getting old and I did not want to wait for it to breakdown and end up with a big paper weight.. I kept the D70 for a while as it was newer. However, I grew increasingly frustrated with the noise levels of the D70, which seemed apparent even at ISO 640 with proper exposure. The Fujifilm S2Pro had no such issue.. When the D40 was announced, I tried it out twice in the shop and read the reviews and I was sold!. It was really light which is important for me as I have a bad back and can't carry a heavy camera for long periods. The kit lens (18-55) is equally light, much lighter than a 18-70 or 18-200VR which I also own.. Shutter response seems very fast with very little blackout. In fact reports from Imaging Resource indicate that the D40 (0.098s) even faster than the D70 (0.124) and Fujifilm (0.160). Perfect for the dance and people photography that I take.. The 3 point autofocus was not an issue for me as I don't trust these multi point focus things. I always use the centre point only and prefocus and shift. Focus seems fast and accurate.. The noise levels at ISO 800 and 1600 are really low and perhaps even a tad better than the Fujifilm. Colors, sharpness and exposure seem right on.. I used to dread carry around my heavy SLRs, now with the D40, its fun time again! Highly recommended for those who don't need to use non AFS lenses.. 

$$;
Pros:. A Top Notch Camera. SUPERB IMAGE QUALITY!. 
Cons:. Top LCD Removed and Battery Life Questionable...mmm not much else really.. 
Summary:. I just recently purchashed a Nikon D40. I am tremendously excited about my new camera. I was looking at the D50, D80, and several other Canon cameras. The Canon cameras just felt horrid in my hands. I know these days people are split between Canons and Nikons but, I simply cannot substitute comfort.. I used to work as a graphic designer before joining the Air Force and I knew what I was looking for. The added reason for myself purcashing a new camera was due to a future addition to our family - my soon to be born baby boy. I wanted a camera where I could capture many of his early life moments with great image clarity. When I really compared (I researched over 30 websites...I found that the D80 really wasn't something I needed...at this moment. The D40 when compared to the D50...really does outshine in several departments. The compromises with the D40 really doesn't hurt me at all. The chief complaint most have from what I've seen is the inability to use non-AF-S/I lenses. I don't have ANY lenses. So I will not be losing any money there by going with the newer D40.. I took several test photos already...and the images are CRYSTAL clear...even when zoomed up completely. This camera was well worth my money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great camera, want.. 
Cons:. Isn't free. Live view is hard to find. 
Summary:. Great camera for the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Excellent sensor produces sharp and accurate results. - Little noise on high ISO. - Large LCD. - Small, compact and very light. - 6mp sensor results in more clear less noisy photos while keeping details. 
Cons:. - Does not work with older Nikon lenses. 
Summary:. I have owned this camera for quite some time now and it is a great backup camera along with my D90. Takes great photos and sometimes i prefer the results to the D90. The biggest downfall in this camera is its lack of internal lens motor which means only new lenses with built in motor will work on this camera. But i can say that this camera is superior to the D50, D60 and the D70 for various reasons. The D60 utilities the same sensor with more pixels punched in which results in noisy photos, specially at night. Also the D70 costs more and along with the D50 are older and feature small LCD screens. If you cannot afford the D80 then this is your choice. Forget the D60. D40, D80 and the D90 are my favorite budget Nikon cameras. Ask ken rockwell! btw nikon release a reamped D40x version, stay away from it.. Speed is key in photography, specially if you do animal photography. This camera is fast with 2.5fps so you wont lose a shot. I have to agree with cnet that the stock kit lens is slow. Let me add that the stock lens lacks VR. At night VR is crucial. Make sure you buy the 18-55mm VR instead. Overall a great, small compact and easy to use camera that delivers results.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Excellent image quality. - Easy and intuitive layout for beginners. - Great ergonomics. - Highly portable. - Decent kit lens. 
Cons:. - No Auto-Bracketing. - Only 3 autofocus points. - Only 2.5 fps burst shooting. 
Summary:. This camera is brilliant. It's my first dSLR, and while I don't have anything to compare it too, I wouldn't choose any other entry-level SLR on the market. It's been available for a long time now, which means you can get it for a great price. Despite being a number of years old, the quality of the camera matches brand-new beginner SLR that cost twice as much or more.. The image quality of this camera is astounding. Misinformed consumers might think that 6 megapixels is not enough, but I think it's perfect. In fact, because there are fewer megapixels than newer cameras, each individual pixel is more accurate and better quality. This also means that higher ISO levels turn out better as well. The only disadvantage of 6 megapixels is that the images cannot be blown up as big.. Nikons are known for their unmatched ergonomics, and this camera is no exception. It feels great to hold and it's light in weight so it's easy to carry around. The menus are also great and easy to navigate for beginners, but there are also plenty of advanced options for more experienced photographers.. The only real complaint I have is the lack of auto-bracketing, which I'd find very useful and it would be fun to experiment with HDR photography. It can still be done but it's just a bit harder to do manually. 3 autofocus points isn't that much of an issue because I always compose my shot before I take a photo anyway, but people using this camera for action photography (which I wouldn't recommend for this camera anyway) might find this to be a drawback. The only other negative, a reasonably slow burst of 2.5fps, will only apply to action photographers as well, so it doesn't really bother me.. Overall, a great beginner SLR or a good secondary camera for professionals (from what I've heard). The image quality is great, and the positives far outweigh the negatives.. 

$$;
Pros:. -plenty of megapixels (6.0 is more than enough for 99% of people). -light and fast startup. -excellent kit lens (18-55mm). -really cheap if you buy it used (like me.!). 
Cons:. -kit lens isn't vr (but not really needed). -autofocus only works with certain models (af-s, for example). -flash sync speed is slow... 
Summary:. each person has different needs and expectations and cameras are no exception. most people buy point and shoots for its compact size but sacrifices quality whereas dslrs offer quality but comes in a bulky form. the D40 is somewhere in between and has the good qualities of both a P&#38;S as well as a dslr. the consumers that D40 targets is anywhere from hobbyists to parents. hobbyists (like myself) will love this, especially in urban settings. I took this on my eurotrip last springbreak and it was the perfect size to haul around and it yielded excellent pictures as well. i noticed that the built-in flash clearly didnt cut it at dark places (such as tombs). sb-400 is a cheap (~$100) external flash thats excellent for indoors (for a party. :]).. for people who read this "review" by cnet and was dissuaded by the "lack" of megapixels, don't buy into it. you can have the best camera and still yield bad pictures. you should use the money that you're saving by buying this camera to get a nice lens (like a 12-24mm or 18-200mm) to compensate for bad camera techniques or maybe buy books and read up on techniques. all in all, quality is excellent and many pictures i took with a tripod and took time to setup the shot, i can print up to 30"x20" crystal clear. as for shots taken at parties, i would never blow it up to a 30x20 or even 18x12.. if you're going on a tight budget, choose this (d40) over the d80 or d300 and get a nice external flash along with a nice lens (18-200 vr.!!).. 

$$;
Pros:. Instruction book is easy to understand.. Easy menu navigation. Real life color. 
Cons:. No grid lines.. You need another lens beside the kit lens.. 
Summary:. I got this as a graduation gift, and it was my first dslr, and I'm extremely pleased. I used an old slr Nikon, but I'm much happier with my own Nikon.. The colors are so vibrant, and you can just play around with the settings to achieve the shot you want. The menus are easy to navigate, and I've taken this camera to baseball games, and I only got 2, at the most, blurry pictures.. The only down side, is the kit lens. My parents got me an additional 55-200mm lens to go along, and I'm so happy that they did, because it really comes in handy.. I've heard alot of complaint about not coming with RAW editing software, but I've never shot with RAW before, so that's not a problem for me. But I'm sure once I start to use RAW, it'll be a problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Weight, Image Quality, Ease of Use, Features, High ISO performance, price, battery life. 
Cons:. Won't Autofocus with some older lenses with the mechanical AF screw. 
Summary:. The Nikon D40 surpasses every expectation I had of it when I first looked at it. Transitioning from a P&#38;S to this was very easy. The D40 is so precise and flawless when it comes to shooting. The size of the D40 is by far the smallest SLR I've ever seen/held. The features on the camera are also very clear and simple. Customization is also quite handy for photographers who don't want the fluff in the menus. The image quality of the D40 is excellent with just 6 megapixels. The myth of more megapixels is better is obviously wrong as the D40 lives up to the image quality if its bigger brothers like the D40x, D60, and D80. The kit lens that is included with the camera is great for beginners. It offers enough zoom for most of the shooting that I do. ISO performance is excellent on this camera. There isn't much noise until ISO 1600--and even then it's still a very respectable picture. Battery life on the camera is excellent as I have averaged close to 800 shots per charge since I started shooting with this camera. I would definitely recommend the D40 for photographers who are looking for their first SLR transition from a P&#38;S. You won't regret buying this bad boy!. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, Very easy to use, Inexpensive, Nikon reputation, Very useful 'Help' menu, nice LCD screen,. 
Cons:. 6 Megapixels may be less for people who want to take very large prints, the outer ring on the kit lens moves while focussing... 
Summary:. If you want me to put it in one sentence then This is the perfect Digital SLR for a beginner. Its very compact (the smallest DSLR, i guess), but Nikon did not compromise on the build quality. Its very sturdy and has a nice comfortable grip. The buttons are all in the exact positions where you would expect. Its also very inexpensive. So if you are planning to take a dip into the world of SLRs, then you'd be happy with its pricing. This would give your budget enough room to invest in lenses!!!. Now for the features... The reason why i call it the perfect DSLR is that, when one upgrades from a point and shoot to a DSLR, then the options and features offered may be overwhelming to the point of getting confused on what to do.. Now here is where the 'Help' menu comes handy. With the click of one button the camera would tell you what the selected mode does and also makes recommendations like "Low lighting, Flash recommended." This is a blessing to a total beginner. The option of Auto and Program-Auto along with a wide variety of scene modes makes the transition from a Point and Shoot a pleasure. The graphical view of the LCD screen shows the representation of a lens aperture and becomes very useful for a beginner to understand the concept of Aperture and Shutter. There are a lot of dedicated buttons (not as many as you would find in a Full frame, but good enough for the first timer) to adjust the most common settings like, exposure compensation, ISO, flash, Self timer. There is also a Function key which the user can customize to do a specific function.. Now although this is a perfect beginner camera, it can be used by amateur or advanced level users as this can handle really well almost any kind of situation. Due to its compact size its great for traveling which even advanced photographers would appreciate.. It has a hot shoe to connect any external flash, you can add accessories like filters, wireless remote controllers, and also pick from an enormous selection of Nikon lenses as it works with any Nikon lens. One thing to note is that the Auto-focus motor is not in the camera body so you need an AF-S lens if you want automatic focusing.. But as we all know nothing is 100% perfect, the D40 also has some minor negetives.. First, the 6 megapixel resoluion might be less for an advanced level photographer, who would like to make Very large prints.. But for most amateur users this is more that enough. My second concern is with the kit lens that comes with the bundle. When you set it to auto focus and push the shutter release half way down to automatically focus, the outer ring of the lens rotates to focus, this becomes a problem when using a filter.. But more advanced lenses of nikon do not have this issue. Another note. If you have large hands and fingers i would recommend you to go to a store and check out the camera for yourself to see how comfortable it feels. I have small hands and it fits better than my biking gloves!!!. So if you are in the market for a compact Digital SLR and can get over the "6 megapixel" thing, then the Nikon D40 should be the ideal camera for you.. P.S. Do invest in a good tripod and you'll always thank yourself!!!!.

Pros:. Compact DSLR. 
Cons:. I have yet to find any. 
Summary:. Most people balk at purchasing this camera because it only has a 6.1 megapixel sensor. Most people don't realize that megapixels don't matter as much as some people think they do. 6.1 megapixels is plenty for 95% percent of photographers. Beyond that this camera has the power of a DSLR while still being simple enough for the beginner. I LOVE mine!!. 

$$;
Pros:. There are many program modes (8 auto and 4 manual), good battery (~500 shots w/flash). 
Cons:. at first you have to set it to display all menu options, and you have to buy RAW software extra.. 
Summary:. Overall the camera is a great buy, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to experience a DSLR without the $1000+ (usually +) price tag.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, nice sharp detailed photos, display, fast continuos shooting. 
Cons:. focusing could be faster. 
Summary:. I have recently gotten into photography, and I wanted to buy a camera that took professional photos and was also digital. My friend has a canon EOS that used film, but I wanted to be able to immediately see the photo I had just taken and perhaps correct it by taking another.. The Nikon D40 is relatively light for a camera in its category.. The neck strap allows for the camera to lie flat against you.. The photos are of professional quality.. I could use it right out of the box with no problems (having never. used a DSLR before).. The battery life is excellent.. There are several in-camera options to change the saturation or. to make colors more or less brilliant.. It comes with very useful software (could potentially replace iPhoto).. Very versatile lens. I bought this camera through Costco and saved almost 100 dollars from the 'cut price' at best buy. If you want even better pictures, then Nikon D40x is available for a couple hundred dollars more. In my opinion, it is not worth it do go the small step up. (the D40x has 10 megapixels while the D40 has 6.1) In my opinion, there is not a big enough difference in the quality of the photos to be worth a couple hundred dollars more. Keep in mind that more is not always better.... So far I have been completely satisfied with my D40. It has surpassed my expectations, and it is the best camera you will find in its category for the best price.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to handle in the dark. 
Cons:. doesn't handle rain that well. 
Summary:. I found this camera through a friend of mine who... donated it to me. Yes, a lovely friend of mine. I've found its great to use in dark places but the flash can cause nasty after effects.. bovinasanctaveritas. 

$$;
Pros:. Auto zoom. Small in size. Light in weight. Very clear shots.. 
Cons:. Make sure you read up on the manual before you use the camera, otherwise you will not be getting the most for your dollar.. 
Summary:. You will enjoy this camera if you are a beginner. The price is right. Make sure you look for the following:. 1. Research the product before you buy.. a. Visit a camera store(Not Best Buy or Radio shack, an actual camera store). Hold the product, ask and get answers to the product. Even request pricing.. b. Visit Cnet, NewEgg, B&#38;H Camera, and any other online retailer for the product.. 2. Make sure you buy the camera with a package, for example I bought my D40 like so:. *D40 Body. *Indoor Lens. *Outdoor Lens. *(2) Lens Filters(MUST HAVE). *Camera Bag. *Small tri-pod. *Extra Battery. *Outdoor Lens Filter(for Sun - Polarized Lens). *LED protection stickers. *SD Card(2GB).

Summary:. IT IS EASY TO USE &#38; TAKES AWESOME PICTURES, BEST CAMERA EVER! I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT!. 

$$;
Pros:. Evrythong about it.. 
Cons:. 6 mp, not for pro's. 
Summary:. I like it, i love it.. This is the camera of my choise, its a camera u should buy if u want to start with digital slr's.. Only downsize is its lack of mp (only 6).. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, weight, image quality, camera build. 
Cons:. prime lenses not available now. 
Summary:. I just received this camera, bought one with a Katzeye screen (a great innovation) through ebay. The camera functions flawlessly and produces great images right out of the box. I was canon p&#38;s shooter until now. Wanted a camera that could produce much better images without going semipro in terms of knowledge and price. This is the perfect fit. Can't wait to take this lightweight nikon on excursions. It's the perfect thing. Very satisfied with the 18-55 lens. Would shoot for, or wait a few weeks, for the same lens with VR in a kit. Should be a stunning combo.. 

$$;
Pros:. negligible noise levels, auto iso, great kit lens. 
Cons:. slightly over exposes... easy fix though. 
Summary:. Wonderful camera to use... don't get caught up in the megapixel wars... 6MP on this camera beats my "compact" 8+MP cameras hands down. Excellent details, easy controls and bright and big LCD.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use. 
Cons:. only 6 megapixels. 
Summary:. I received this camera as a gift and the more I use it, the more I love it.It is a great model to move from a point and shoot digital to a dSLR. It goes from totally automatic-point and shoot mode- to totally automatic and all the in betweens.The on screen editing is great you can go right thru and edit the pictures, remove red eye and enhance all right on the camera before you move it to a computer.The colors are very bright and sharp.Focus time is quick and there is not alot of lag between pics like most point and shoot models.The big negative I've read about this model is that it is only 6mp.But from what I've read this model takes better pics at 6mp than most models at 8-10mp. Great camera!. 

$$;
Pros:. Low price, color accuracy, easy to use menus. 
Cons:. Very wide lens. 
Summary:. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. This camera has everything you'd want in a D-SLR but with a price not much higher than some point-and-shoots. The color of the pictures in gorgeous, especially outside. It's extremely easy to use. Just click it on, point, then shoot! I have nothing bad to say about the Nikon D40. You won't either.. 

$$;
Pros:. Takes great photos. Great at night. Great flash. Fast! 2.9fps! No flash priority; neat option. Small light and compact for a quality DSLR. Great price.. 
Cons:. Only 3 fields for auto focus. Limited number of mega pixels.. 
Summary:. This is a great camera. I took it over spring break to France and Spain. I kept it on auto or the auto with no flash option. The photos were phenomenal. The day photos, night photos, everything is vibrant with accurate colors. I swear by auto, its perfect for 98% of your shots!. Don't let the number of mega pixels worry you too much. You get what you pay for, if you want more mega pixels, buy the d40x. Unless you're going to make prints greater than 8x10 or if you like to severely crop, 6.1 MP is plenty. The quality of the camera has much less to do with MPs than many hype it to be. If you really want more, you can spend $400 for a 10 MP model.. Bottom line: If you want to take the most amazing photos, have never owned a DSLR, and only make 8x10s or smaller, this is the camera for you!. 

$$;
Pros:. EASY TO USE, PICTURE QUALITY IS GREAT, SMALL SIZE. 
Cons:. BETTER QUALITY KIT LENS. 
Summary:. GOT RID OF MY $500 POINT &#38; SHOOT SONY CAMERA, BECAUSE I KEPT MISSING THE SHOT. THE NIKON D40 IS A FANTASTIC CAMERA, LOVE THE AUTO-FOCUS. SOLD THE 18-55MM KIT LENS AND BOUGHT THE NIKON 18-135MM LENS THAT IS SOLD WITH THE NIKON D-80. EVEN MY 11 YEAR OLD SON CAN USE...JUST USE THE RING TO TELE-ZOOM TO FRAME THE SHOT , THEN POINT AND SHOOT....YOU WILL HAVE A VERY SHARP DETAIL PHOTO 99% OF THE TIME.. 

$$;
Pros:. Photo quality, build quality, handling, value-for-money. 
Cons:. Some competitors have IS and dust removal, no RAW editing software. 
Summary:. I read the cnet review of the Nikon D40 with interest and I agree with the overall positive rating it got therein, but I was puzzled with a few factual and conceptual errors the author has made, to the detriment of this excellent camera.. First of all, I would be deeply disappointed if cnet would join in with the marketing departments of the camera manufacturers, which would have us all believe that more pixels means better pictures. In actual fact, it tends to be quite opposite, because more pixels means smaller pixels, smaller pixels means poorer light absorption capability, and that means more noise in your photos, or more noise processing by the camera's circuitry, which affects the quality. The only reason for the megapixel obsession is that cameras are sold by marketing departments, not by engineering ones. People get easily impressed by numbers, and that's all the manufacturers care. Please do not side with this thinking, and do not promote it. Two megapixels can produce a 5"x7" print, so six cannot be bad by any count. It is because of its reasonably sized sensor that Nikon D40 has a good noise characteristics, so it can afford having ISO 200 as its default sensitivity, unlike its more expensive 10 MP siblings, which have to start at ISO 100 to produce a clean, noise-free image.. Also, the 18-55mm lens is equivalent to 27.5-84mm in film camera terms (x1.525 conversion), not 28.8-88mm (x1.6 conversion, a Canon sensor/lens combination would convert like that). That means (a bit) more wide angle, another rarity in the world of consumer cameras. Speaking of the lens, I compared it with my old 24-85mm f/2.8-4D, the lens that costs 5-6 times the price. I am aware that my old lens is not the best that Nikon could make, despite its price, but was nonetheless impressed with the 18-55mm kit lens, because I could not notice a visible difference in sharpness, and it actually has a visibly smaller distortion at the wide angle end. I know that some would say that the sharpness comparison may be limited by the camera's low resolution, but then we're splitting some really microscopic hairs. Some purple fringing may be there if you insist, but is controlled easily with the aperture. Nothing's perfect, but I can bet this is better than any other lens in the class.. D40 also has the flash synchronization down to 1/500s, which is unique. It provides for a great flexibility of the fill-flash in strong light.. The comment on the handling (with reference to the aperture-priority mode) is superficial. All exposure-related settings can be made with primary commands - dial and buttons, there's no going to menu involved here. Other settings are accessed via one Fn button and via the menu. Accessing a frequently used setting in the menu takes two presses on the same button, as this takes you to the last used setting, which is most likely the one you need. I agree it would be much nicer having a couple of more hard buttons, but it's really not a big deal. Once you have made the one-time adjustments according to your preferences, you are one-, or sometimes two-presses away from most settings you may need in your work, like ISO or White Balance.. I bought this Nikon D40 recently, after having used an F80 (N80 in the USA) for seven years. It should have been natural to go up and get a D80 or D200, which were both well within my budget. I decided instead to do something unusual for a relatively advanced user - go simple and get a D40. I figured I could always upgrade if I need to, and possibly keep D40 as a back-up. Now I don't think that will happen any time soon, and I think I have made one of my cleverest purchases ever.. To see any noticeable difference, you would have to skip the D40x and D80, and get the D200, and then you will get some better handling and more muscle, at the cost of a far greater weight. D40 is featherweight.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light weight, easy to use, inexpensive memory card. 
Cons:. Can't find one yet. 
Summary:. It's a great camera for someone moving up from a point and shoot.. I want to take sport and concert pictures for my son but the point and shoot is too slow and I can't zoom close enough to the stage.. Another reason I picked this Nikon is because of the type of memory card it uses.. SD cards are much cheaper than CF or Memory Stick cards.. I got a high speed 2G card for just $10.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent image quality, wonderful user interface and controls, very solid and high quality feel/construction, Just a joy to use. 
Cons:. Lacks support for semi-older AF lenses (AF-S only), no grid overlay, full auto mode gets the lighting all wrong almost the time.. 
Summary:. I would like to mention, first off, that I take issue with cnet's complaint about it being "only" 6 megapixels. They've obviously not done too much research on the "megapixel myth." Your normal 10mp point and shoot is using a sensor half the size of my pinky fingernail and capturing at 75-100dpi with an ISO of 50 or 75. That's a recipe for cruddy images. This is delivering a resolution of 300dpi with a full size sensor using a minimum ISO of 200 (which is a GOOD thing for anyone who knows what that means...) The image &#38; sensor quality of this camera MORE than makes up for the fact that it's "only" 6MP.. Cons first (pros later):. - The lack of support for AF lenses (AF-S only) is a bit of a downer. There are some nice, lower priced AF lenses out there. (for those of you who don't know, AF-S means the focus motor is IN the lens instead of the camera). There ARE, however, a huge variety of lenses available for AF-S and anything that you wanted in AF almost definitely has an alternative in AF-S. AF-S is the way things are heading at the moment for Nikon.. - A grid overlay for the "rule of thirds" would have been nice, although this is a very minor gripe.. - For some reason if you operate in full auto, the lighting always ends up wrong except on almost all occasions. It took about two weeks for me to REALLY figure out how to get great quality images. Full auto still looks good, but picky people like me have to do a good bit of editing to get it to look PERFECT. Using programmed auto or aperature priority is the way to go IMHO. The camera comes with a GREAT manual (better than the Canon XTi one that came with my wife's camera) and it walks you through all the steps regarding the different things you can set up.. Pros:. - The image quality is just excellent. There's no two ways about this one. They really put a high quality sensor and great electronics in this camera. Entry level or not, they did an exceptional job. Pro reviewers are recommending that you pass up on the 10mp D40x and get this one instead because of it's superior sensor and image quality. Spend the extra $250 you'll save on the 55-200mm lens that Nikon makes (model# 2156).. - The menu and interface drew me in the first time I used it. Nikon REALLY got it right this generation. It's appealing to the eyes and very user friendly. The screen is larger than most and the information readout clearly gives you all the current settings. As is normal, the viewfinder information readout informs you of the current settings as well. I loved all the features about the camera, but the interface and meny system was what REALLY sold me. As soon as I started using it I was instantly sold. You bring up the main interface with one button and with another you enter an "edit" mode which looks just like the information readout. You simply use the d-pad to scroll around the screen and change the setting that you happen to be on. There are also numerous settings that can be changed by simply holding other buttons on the camera and using the scroll wheel.. - The camera itself feels great. It's light, but not too light, and it definitely doesn't have a "cheap" feel to it. Nikon uses a sort-of matte/textured finish on their bodies that hides bumps and scratches very well and adds to the overall "good" feel of the camera.. - The operation is quiet. The shutter is more of a subdued &#38; satisfying "clunk" instead of a high pitched clank and motor sound that a lot of cameras have.. All in all this is an EXCELLENT camera. I've read articles about it from some pros who carry it everywhere since it's light and takes great photos. Ignore the nagging thoughts that 6MP isn't enough. 6MP is more than plenty unless you plan on doing some very heavy cropping on your images. There are still lots of professionals out there using Nikon D70s for their trade...and that's a 6MP camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. No learning curve. 
Cons:. Zoom is rather weak; get the telephoto accessory. 
Summary:. Our kids are getting older and we were frustrated by the so-so quality of our point&#38;shoot digital cameras...so many lost moments. We wanted a DSLR for better pic quality but literally know nothing about photography.. The Nikon D-40 is "only" about $200 more than a good point&#38;shoot digital camera, but the quality is well worth it, and it's incredibly easy to use. Within days we had many great shots - more than we'd achieved in YEARS with p&#38;s cameras!. p.s. - Don't sweat the fact that the D-40 comes with just 6+ megapixels - that's plenty for 5x7 and even 8x10" photos.. 

$$;
Pros:. High resolution, easy to use, takes great photos!. 
Cons:. Only 6 megapixles, Takes a required lense, Need software to view raw format.. 
Summary:. The Nikon d40 has all the slr needa packed away in a small, light-weight body. I has indeed recently purchased the nikon d40 aand im proud to say that i have taken quiet good photos. There are a few things i would like to say though. 1: I purchased my nikon d40 from parallel imports and the software they gave me was pictureproject, a software i could use for uploading raw images. I found that it was all in japanese. I cant do much about it now, so i stick with raw-jpeg.. 2: Some say that only the nikon d40 can only take a standard lense of a type. This is not true! The nikon d40 can fit all lenses, but the ones that has and af-nx lense you can only do manual focus because the motors inside the shudder relese are different i sizes.. 3: The nikon d40 has no automatic sensor cleaning mechanisim. This means you have to clean it automaticly, whitch is dodgy.. -aidan. 

$$;
Pros:. Weight, size, quality, I can go on and on!. 
Cons:. None that I've found. 
Summary:. When my 2 year old D70 started acting quirky, I decided to step up to the D200. Off I went, debit card in hand, and picked one up. The romance lasted for 2 weeks, it was big, and heavy, and had way too many features that I truly didn't need. I boxed it up and returned it, looking at other cameras to replace my D70. I looked at the Canon Rebel but when I picked up the D40 I knew that it was the one to go with. It does everything I need, it's light, and it's fast. Since I saved so much over the cost of the D200, I bought the 18-135mm "kit lens" that comes with the D80. This was a great choice also. For what I do I now have the perfect camera. The D40 is far better than c/net's review. It is a solid, basic DSLR for those of us who grew up with a manual SLR. Why does everything these days have to have all the bells and whistles to make it seem better??? Trust me, it's not the case!. 

$$;
Pros:. good price, good features. 
Cons:. battery life. 
Summary:. excellent camera for the price. i havent been disappointed in the quality of pictures makes a excellent camera. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality, value, ergonomics, compact yet comforable, excellent viewfinder... the list goes on.. 
Cons:. It's Achilles heel - lack of legacy lens support. 
Summary:. It's very nice to see an entry level product that doesn't make you compromise in a lot of areas. The image quality is very good, at any price point. The kit lens, feature list and build quality are also very good.. I do see the lack of support for non AF-S lenses as an issue, while not for me personally. I understand Nikon's reasoning considering this is an entry-level camera. However, thanks in part to this camera's excellent quality and compact size, it seems that Nikon has attracted many existing DSLR owners buying this as a second camera.. I do feel that CNET missed the mark somewhat with this review. This camera will not dissapoint.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightweight, bright LCD screen, Easy to navigate. 
Cons:. Limited range of lenses specifically made for it, no LCD protector.. 
Summary:. This camera is great for students, beginning and aspiring photographers. It's Nikon's lowest priced dSLR camera. The lens isn't something to be desired but does the job. I've made some pretty good panoramas with the supplied lens. One thing Nikon really need for the robust 2.5" screen is a screen cover. All in all this is a wonderful camera. I plan on some really good shots with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality; build quality; Super value. 
Cons:. No one can compete the photo quality in $$$$; Not MIJ. 
Summary:. The CNET reviewer, Lori Grunim, is bias to the Canon product line too much. Or, done the reviews only on paper and technical specifications other than real photo and image comparisions. Nikon D80 is much better camera than Canon XTi if you have a lot of non AF-S or AF-I lense. Nikon D40 is using 6 megapixel CCD to generate better photo image than Canon XTi in 8 megapixels CMOS. It's super bargain to the value and photo quality. Do not follow the CNET's bias review and listen to user's command. I believe most of users are very happy with the D40's picture quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, Size, Weight, Photo Quality, Lens, LCD and Menus. 
Cons:. Bad software, AF can lag under certain shooting conditions. 
Summary:. I am glad I did not read the CNET review before I decided to buy this camera. The Nikon D40 is a fantastic camera, much better than the CNET review indicates.. I bought the D40 in Jan. 2006 as an upgrade to my 3MP Nikon Coolpix. I am a novice photographer, so the point-and-shoot was fine for awhile. But I became so frustrated with the shutter lag and less than perfect print quality that I stopped using it. When I went shoping for a new and upgraded point-and-shoot, I was again disappointed with what I could get for $300 -$400 so I decided to spend the extra money for what I really wanted, a SLR (quicker shots, better pictures, more manual settings, etc).. I am really happy I went with the SLR and the Nikon D40. The first 200 photos have been excellent. I have received countless compliments from family and friends on the photos of our newborn. Also, the size, weight, and ergnomics of the camera is what initially sold me. It just feels good in my hands, much more comfortable (smaller, lighter) than the other SLR I looked at (Canon, Pentax, Olympus, Sony). It's small and light enough to bring with you to all occasions(the bulky size of a SLR was one thing I was initially worried about).. And at $599, the price right. Less than the Cannon XT Rebel and the Sony.. The auto focus can be a tad slow, as the reviewer pointed out, but that's usually because I am too close to the subject; probably the result of an amateur photographer. I found the included software to be cumbersome, but in fairness I haven't spent much time with it. But since I spent the money for the camera, not the software, that doesn't bother me so much. Finally, I was a little hesitant about the 6 MP since some of the other entry level SLRs have 8MP. But as the other reviews indicate, 6MP is more than adequate for the Average Joe and the results of my initial photos have been excellent.. If you are looking for an entry level DSL, do yourself a favor and buy this camera. It is a perfect for amateurs like me that want to move up from a point-and-shoot to a SLR without breaking the bank. Listen to the customer comments, not the review, and you will be pleased that you decided to buy this camera!. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely light and compact, great LCD display, very good battery life. 
Cons:. Not fast enough for sports, no camera raw interface for CS2 (yet). 
Summary:. I have had a Nikon F-100 digital camera for years and finally made the switch to digital after studying a lot of cameras and reviews. I have a lot of big and expensive lenses but realized this 27-83 equivalent works fine for almost everything I photograph. This camera and lens combination is so light I carry it everywhere. The LCD display is excellent and battery life is outstanding. 6 MP is more than enough for everyone except professional photographers. Be sure to go to KenRockwell.com to help get the initial exposure settings dialed in correctly. Go with this camera unless you need a D200 - you can't go wrong!. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality; speed (somewhat); Presdes for dummies; Assistance for newbs; Portability/size. 
Cons:. Only three autofocus areas; no built-in AF motor, 10 MP would be nicer; A few more programmable butons would be nice. 
Summary:. This is a very nice camera for those stepping up from point and shoot cameras. To prove its friendliness to newbs, it provides text (and sometimes visual) assistance. For example, it has a diagram of how large the aperture is in information display mode. The camera also provides explanations of certain settings and features in the menu system. I'm not too much of an expert, but I can tell that the image quality on this camera is good, details are reasonably visibl for 6 MP. Nikon resisted increasing resolution, which can be a good thing because upgrading the 8 MP would be near useless (and increase file size in vain), and moving up to 10 MP would decrease the D40's difference from the D80, which can threaten D80 sales; thus keeping the camera strictly entry level. The camera feels quick, albeit I know it's not quick for a DSLR, it's not like anyone moving up to the DLSR market can tell.. Lens compatibility is slightly dissapointing. Yes, they work with all of Nikon's lenses, but the older lenses (G-type, I believe) which don't have built-in AF motors will suffer. It only allows for AF when using the newer 'CPU' lenses. Again, must people moving into the DSLR market won't notice the difference. While I'm on lenses, the kit lens are quite slow, which is slightly dissapointing. Another very annoying thing is that it does not come with a lens hood (or a cap for that matter), which means you'll have to go hunt for one; extremely annoying. The lack of a lens hood has already wrecked at least a few of my shots.. There are only three autofocus areas. Ironically, less versitile than some point and shoot cameras. This is another annoying feature, even for a DSLR newb like me.. A nice thing is portability. It's nice for those who don't have extra lenses, or external flashes. But for those who already have a full-sized bag to carry their equippment anyway, I'd say it doesn't matter much. Despite the small size, the camera has good ergonomics for hands; the hand grip is comfortable, and thumbs have a good grip on the back. An annoyance is that the viewfinder sits too far in on the camera (which is uncomfortable anyway). This forces users to push their head further into the camera, thus smudging noses onto the monitor (which, by the way, is a really nice monitor). Again, an uncomfortably hard eyepiece. Other than that, the other 'flaw' may be that the camera is very light. This could be a good thing, but with heavier lenese, the camera's center of balance goes forward into the lens, so that the camera is constantly trying to fall forward. The camera body is made from a sturdy and hard plastic that is found on higher-end models as well. I wouldn't think this is 'droppable' though, or weather sealed as well. The body's exterior has good fit and finish, where all the different panels fit nicely together.. The camera has good performance, better in some fronts than others though. Start up time is fast at 0.18 (but it feels slightly longer than it sounds.) Focus time as I said before, is slightly longer than it should be. Very quiet lens, though.. Again, good camera for begginers with on-screen assistance and preset exposure modes.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightweight, great picture quality, easy for 1st time SLR user. 
Cons:. Have to press face up against LCD screen to use viewfinder. 
Summary:. This is my 1st digital SLR. I was totally torn between the Canon Digital Rebel XT and the Nikon D40, and went with this one because of the outstanding user reviews and because it felt much more comfortable to grip in my hand.. I've had this camera for 24 hours now and can say that you don't need to read the manual before you start taking pictures using their preset auto modes. I can't wait to get fully into what this thing can do once I master the manual controls. I took several shots using my point and shoot on auto settings, then shot the same subject (still life, same lighting) using this thing, and the pictures really are worlds apart. Best part about this (and other SLRs), and the #1 reason I switched from a high end point and shoot- NO SHUTTER LAG. Even using autofocus this thing just goes!. IMHO, you can't blow anything up to the size I want (huge) and expect to retain crispness unless you use an 8 x 10 large format film camera, so this 6 megapixel camera is perfect for anyone looking for a take everywhere camera that (supposedly) holds up to 8 x 10 enlargements.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality, auto shooting modes great for entry users.. 
Cons:. Advanced controls alien to inexperienced users.. 
Summary:. To start out with, I saw the rave reviews of this camera and it sparked me to become interested in it. I've wanted to pursue photography and I felt that an entry level dSLR might help me get my feet wet and enjoy myself. The Nikon D40 is the exact camera to do that with.. A lot of people have complained about the kit lens being a little slow, but ultimately if you're new to using a dSLR, you won't see a whole lot of quirk to it. It'll feel fantastic in your hands and you'll be in awe at the fact that it just took a fantastic picture. And if you don't want to deal with the slowness... use the manual focus. I actually found it quite enjoyable to tinker with my focus manually.. The auto shooting is pretty great. I feel like my camera's getting the good shot for me as long as I zoom properly. Although it's hardly the camera that makes a picture, it feels very comfortable to my hand, and I felt that the camera was the perfect type of comfortable. It's not heavy by any means.. Although... I'm not an experienced photographer and won't admit to be. The manual modes included are difficult and if you don't want to read them right away, stick to the auto shooting mode and just toy around with settings before going head first into the others. If you're willing to learn the included guide is worth it.. I just can't help but feel confident when I use this camera. The best part about it though, is that it's very affordable compared to the others that I looked at. I recommend this HIGHLY to anyone who wants a dSLR but doesn't want to spring for a dramatically expensive camera..

Pros:. See Every Other Test Superb Image Quality etc. etc.. 
Cons:. Legacy Lens Limitations For Some. 
Summary:. It is with sadness that I write about the unbelievably flawed test made by the tester on this site. See the following followed by links to many professional camera testers.. First the 'issues' that do NOT exist:. http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/readflat.asp?forum=1034&#38;thread=21373803. Now for some truly professional tests from universally respected testers:. http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond40/. and. http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/ND40/ND40A.HTM. and. http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/nikon/d40-review/index.shtml. and one from a reviewer that some respect and others question:. http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40.htm. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice quality feel and good price. 
Cons:. No lens cap retainer cord. 
Summary:. Nikon has a reputation for producing quality cameras. The D-40 fits into this category. Its a quality camera with all the usual features common to SLRs. I like the feel. Ive owned 3 35mm SLRs and 4 point and shoot digital cameras and this camera has a nice comfortable feel in your hands. I like the smaller size. Its great for casual photography. The D-40 is a great step up from point and shoot cameras. It took me awhile to get used to the SLR routine  looking through the viewfinder and adjusting the focal length of the lens manually. As for the fact that its only 6 megapixels: Ive taken great photos with a lot less. Print quality is a factor of matching the resolution of the printer to the image. In any event, I would recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, reliable, durable, trustworthy.. 
Cons:. Software leaves much to be desired.... 
Summary:. Most "F" mount lenses will fit on this body, so you can find the older manual focus lenses for relatively low prices. They are excellent lenses (among, if not the best). As for the megapixel myth; which would you rather have? A 6,1 mp that gives you 300dpi in *.jpg mode (240dpi for RAW/*.nef mode) or an 8, 10 or 12 mp that yields 72dpi in *.jpg mode? Your screen is at 72dpi, most printers are BELOW 300dpi, those that do more either have very high prices or extrapolate.. This camera will give you ease of use and you won't have to hold it at arm's length to focus. The best of all, it's ready to shoot when you turn it on, the response is immediate. You'll soon wonder why you didn't get a dSLR in the first place! Another good point, it will last you a lot longer than any Canon ever will.... 

$$;
Pros:. Superb image quality, light weight, great LCD screen, ease of use.. 
Cons:. None that need mentioning. If you want superfast get a D200.. 
Summary:. If you are considering your first DSLR and are moving from compact point and shoot then look no further. This is the camera to buy. I love mine and I am sure you will not be disappointed. Don't let the 10 Megapixel Canon EOS 400D sway you. 6.1 is plenty for crystal clear images. The D40 feels like a real camera and is far more comfortable than the Canon. Try them in the shop if you don't believe me.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. 
Cons:. none to speak of. 
Summary:. I received this as a gift and love it! It's easy to use, lightweight and compact while substantial.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image quality, nice size, fast and friendly to use. Perfect entry level dslr.. 
Cons:. Get better glass...kit lens is cheap.. 
Summary:. I recently purchased my D40 as a backup and I must say the image quality is tremendous. You will be able to do beautiful A4, A3 enlargements. I recently got back a poster sized print of the George Washington Bridge- Awesome! I don't understand why CNET's Lori Grunin has the D40's 6 megapixel as a Cons.. CNET, please stop propagating the more pixels yields better images message. Only 6 megapixels? What we need are larger, better quality pixels, not a larger pixel count. If you are doing larger than poster sized prints then maybe look at the Nikon d200 with 10 megapixels. In fact more pixels frequently deteriorates the image quality because it creates more image noise. It also takes up more memory and drive space. If you want top notch images, save your money and buy the best lens you can afford. That should be CNET and reviewer Lori Grunins message&not that more is better. You should be applauding Nikon for not following the marketing trend of just adding more pixels to sell products to the average, uninformed consumer who gauges image quality purely on the number of pixels. Shame on CNET for not properly educating your readers.. 

$$;
Pros:. long battery life. lightweight. didn't break when I dropped it. not so many bells and whistles you get overwhelmed. 
Cons:. with some Nikon lenses, you only have manual focus available. focus point can be easily changed by a bump of the nose. 

$$;
Pros:. crisp, sharp pics. 
Cons:. no auto bracketing, only three points of focus. 
Summary:. I've really enjoyed my experience with the D40, but have found some features a bit limiting.. 

$$;
Pros:. This camera is very easy to use, it takes great pictures. 
Cons:. 6 MegaPixels. 
Summary:. This is a great camera, it is easy to use and takes great pictures.. 

$$;
Pros:. Perfect picture quality, great feel. 
Cons:. Requires some reading understand all the features. 
Summary:. For a novice, this was a huge change from a compact digital camera. The picture quality is just perfect. I recommend this camera to anyone with kids, you won't be dissapointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to pick up and shoot - good learning curve. 
Cons:. Only three focus points. 
Summary:. having finally put aside my trusty old FZ3 I plumped for the D40 rather than the Canon 400D, for the simple reason of price - and also for simple reason that the average snapper (to be separated from a true photographer) won't ever need anything greater than 6mp, and with the change I saved from NOT buying the 400D, I bought myself a nice 80-200mm lens. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use, light and very responsive. 
Cons:. No auto bracketing.. 
Summary:. I have used this camera for a few months now. The features it offers, makes taking pictures very easy. The menu system is great.. On the down side.. This camera desperately needs auto bracketing. Almost everyone wants to try HDR photography these days.. With out auto bracketing, this camera will not easily work for you. The D80 only offers 3 auto bracket frames not much better.. Look at what the competition offers before making the purchase.. Nikon made a big mistake by leaving out auto bracketing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed compared to Point and Shoot, great color and detail,. 
Cons:. Should come with at least a 64meg card since memory is so cheap!. 
Summary:. I LOVE this camera. I used SLRs for years and then went with a Nikon 990. It was slow awkward but did the job. Now that I have the D40 my inner photographer has been born again! For less then $600!! I paid more for the 990 back 6 years ago. I use photo software but unlike the old camera, it rarely needs to be adjusted. The sensors and program is that good! Contrast is good and it auto sets EVERYTHING if you want it to! I even took pictures in complete darkness and it set the ISO and all the settings and gave me the coolest picture of an abandoned church. But it still gives you full control over everything. Just get it, you wont be sorry. Besides with the way tech is always improving you'll probably upgrade sooner then later anyways, so why not take the step with an affordable competent camera like THIS one!. 

$$;
Pros:. Big display, light weight, inuitive menus, versatile lens. 
Cons:. Only 3 focus areas, can't use old lens. 
Summary:. I did years of 35mm film photograhy with a Nikon FM. With digital SLRs being so expensive ($3K+), I then went through a couple canon point and shoot digitals (like the SD450) and was always dissapointed with the pics.. I had access to a Nikon D50 for about 1 year and was impressed with the photos, easy of use . I was about to buy the D50 when the D40 was released in Dec 06. I was swayed by bigger display screen and smaller body. The D40 also has a updated menu which is much easier to navigate through. The camera is very easy to use. It is set up much like the old film camera, so it is an easy transition.... plus it has all the benefits of the digital era.. This is dubbed an the SLR newbie/ inexpensive entry level camera, but by the time you add in a SD card, carrying case, tax etc, you get to about $900, so it is still a fair cash outlay. Bottom line: a great value and a great camera to get started. Most newbie SLR photographers don't use all the functions on a D70 or D80, so why pay for them. The D40 is a solid choice. If you are a budding Herb Ritts and outgrow it, you can always keep it as backup.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy interface, Outstanding Image Quality, Great Battery Life. 
Cons:. AF-S Lens limitations, Poor Image Software. 
Summary:. I purchased this camera last week and have shot already 400+ pics over the weekend. I am very happy with the quality and ease of use for the D40. It does have a nice professional feel to the camera without being too big. The image quality is outstanding and the camera is very easy to use. With all of the pictures I shot I still have great battery life left! I have already found myself tinkering with the P and A settings, although there is really no need. The image software that comes with the kit is useless. You would do better with picasa or any other web service. I wish the software had RAW data capability, but you have to pay extra for that. It is a fun camera that offers a ton of possibilities. I purchased a 55mm-200mm AF-S lens on eBay last night for $150, so I am looking forward to seeing how that works out. Overall an excellent choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, lightweight, easy to understand menus. 
Cons:. No autofocus with older, non-AF-S lenses. 
Summary:. As usual, CNET makes factual errors in their DSLR reviews.. If I understand the review correctly, according to the reviewer, certain settings are only accessible by going through the menus and using the four-way button set. This is certainly true enough, BUT in the next sentence, she gives an example:. "For instance, in aperture-priority mode, you can change the aperture only via the command dial; to change the shutter speed, you must go through the aforementioned process.". I take the "aforementioned process" to mean going through the menus.. Alright. There are several things wrong with the example:. 1) The point of aperture-priority mode is to allow the user to change only the aperture and leave the camera to choose the shutter speed for you. No camera on the market (not even professional DSLRs) allows you to change shutter speeds in Aperture Priority mode. If you want to change shutter speeds, then you will need to go into Shutter priority mode, or Manual mode. There is an EXCEPTION, however:. 2) If the user nevertheless wants to change shutter speeds in Aperture Priority mode (for example to second guess the camera's metering) then there is an Exposure Compensation button (labelled "+/-") just behind the shutter button which allows you to do so. Holding down this button and rotating the command dial in A.Priority mode will indeed vary the shutter speeds. There is no need to go into the menus to do so. In fact, when in Shutter Priority mode, the same Exposure Compensation button will allow the user to vary aperture settings.. 3) In fact, the points above are the same for any camera, even a Canon 400D (Rebel XTi) or a Nikon D200.. 

$$;
Pros:. Handy, very good battery life time (long lasting after two years), good photo quality. 
Cons:. White balance, no live view.. 
Summary:. Excellent for non-professionals. 

$$;
Pros:. As far as I have noticed, my favorite feature on the camera is manual focus. You can do far more with manual focus than auto, and it seems alot of the entry level dSLR's are putting the auto focus with no manual, as well as no lens options. UGH.. 
Cons:. I guess I would say I dont like the fact its a 6 megapixel, but thats decent size for 8x10's. The only reason you would use larger megapixel is for cropping and zooming before actually making the photo, and for posters. Its the other features.... 
Summary:. I look forward to buying one. We have a Fuji S1000 coming, but I am gonna dish out some extra cash for the D40.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Inexpensive. -Good for Beginners. -Lighweight and Compact. -Exeptional picture quality for the money. - Battery Life. 
Cons:. -Too Small. -Poorly Designed. -No AF Motor. -Poor Image Sensor. -Nikon did not make any attempt to make Accessories for it. (Battery Grip). 
Summary:. The Nikon D40 DSLR is a great beginner''s camera. This camera is good for anyone who wants a DSLR but doesnt want to have to mess with a professional DLSR. Also during this ecomomy it is a great camera that is in many people's price range. The problems with this camera - it is way too small, almost too small, and too compact and lightweight, the battery grip is a must. That brings me to my next point, Nikon did not consider the D40 "professional" so they didnt make a battery grip that was compatible for it. Also once you have learned the camera you have nowhere to go with it. It is strictly a begginers camera. The next thing is the help program that almost always pop's up giving you advice, this is not a camera for people who know what they are doing with a DSLR. And no AF motor means that you have to have a lens that has a built in AF motor if you want Auto Focus. Lastly the Image Sensor of this camera is awful, the 6.1 megapixles isnt the problem but the cheap and low end image sensor creates a problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, battery life is terrific, ergonomics. 
Cons:. Lens restrictions, color is funky sometimes. 
Summary:. I upgrade from a fuji to nikon and am somewhat disappointed with the ccd technology. The colors are somewhat bland and photo program does not really help enhance?. 

$$;
Pros:. Very compact, Very light, very good menu system, nice big LCD. 
Cons:. Not so good with Noise at High ISO in low lighting, kit lens isn't very good. 
Summary:. I borrowed this camera to shoot a local show and had the ISO set to 1600 since that's where it should normally be when you're doing concert photography in very low lighting and all the pictures came out very noisy. I was disappointed since I thought it would rival the Canon 350D/Rebel XT and was contemplating on buying this model but for now I am just going to stick with my Canon : ).. The kit lens isn't very good I'd recommend getting a nicer piece of glass and just buying the body alone. Great camera for anything though but concert photography.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks great on LCD. 
Cons:. Photos came out not sharp enough.. 
Summary:. I was disappointed with photos taken at my son's concert at his school. All evening photos lacked clarity and blur images. I would return the camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. We stopped using it after it broke the third time. We could not justify spending more money to fix it. It is in our closet collecting dust and I think a spider has built a web on it. As far as Pros go, it makes a good spider web house.. 
Cons:. It breaks. It is expensive to fix. They charge just enough to not justify buying a new one every time it breaks. They will not tell you how much to fix it until you send it in. Then they hold you hostage until you pay them. We did this twice.. 
Summary:. The Nikon D40 breaks. the autofocus mode no longer works. it will not take pictures in auto focus only in manual focus so all pictures are out of focus. The built in flash no longer works. The Nikon D40 autofocus and built in flash break just after the warranty expires and they charge you way too much to fix it. This camera sucks. do not buy it. We wasted three years with this garbage and then we bought a Canon. Do not buy the Nikon D40 we regret that we ever did. We spent way too much to buy and then way too much to fix it the first time and then way too much to fix it the second time and now it is making a very expensive dust collector and spider web house in our closet..
