if i return , i will definitely take a `` reserved '' space for the coffee shop and hopefully not have to end up in a fight over it .
but , i almost did n't stay at this hotel due to the horrendous front entrance design .
there are only a few parking spaces and i drove around the block numerous times for 10 minutes until one finally opened up - on a weekday night .
they do , however , have plenty of reserved parking spaces for the customers of the coffee shop and sub shop that are off the lobby .
i have never been to any hotel of any class or size in my entire life that did not have provisions for parking to check in .
the single lane driveway is very small and they have signs that warn you not to park - only drop off .
i could n't have been more pleased with this room and the front desk staff exceeded expectations .
i was furious but chose not to take it out on front desk as i know it 's not their fault .
especially loved the bathroom counter top that was separate from the sink counter top and provided a nice place to put luggage and shoes underneath instead of crowding the living space of the room .
that would have helped a lot but i guess management is too cheap to fund that position . . . fail .
