This is one of the more effective water filters I've used
It states 300 gallon service capacity
At least I've used them for over that amount without issue
When you change filters, the flow acts funny for about the first half gallon - that's normal
Some filters produce cloudy-looking water for the first gallon, but this one doesn't
I've had no issues with these filters
This is by far the simplest, most secure and easiest filter to install that I've experienced
Also, I didn't find a better deal anywhere else including the manufacturer's site
They try to sell these single by single, but sometimes in a pack of three
It's just another filter to keep buying at its hefty price
But its easy to install
Works great
Best price I could find on the internest
Shipped quickly with no problems
Will buy this again in 8 months when I need another one
