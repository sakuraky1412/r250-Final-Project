simple , record what i want to watch it when i want to watch it  .

easy to use for the new tech literate person  .

not for those stuck back in the 50's in tv watching mentality , unless you have someone who can show you how to use it this system is for the new technology literate people  .

if all you know how to do is change channels , it may not be for you  .

my 86 year old granny loves it cause we recorded some of her favorite old movies she can watch anytime  .

she exclaimed , what will they come up with next  .

has to be one of the best products on the market  .

of course we got it free with dish network promotion for new customers  .

who would pay for it , when they will give it to you for free  .

the picture is crystal clear , especially on our new high definition tv  .

you can see the details in all outdoor films , and the color quality is fantastic  .

you can actually almost count the feathers on birds  .

and it shows what movie stars and model really look like up close  .

really , really good  .

great for new action movies and all other programming  .

i see why the won the best award  .

enough said , get one , you wo not be sorry you did .

great machine almost all of the cons in the main review have been fixed well worth the extra $5 a month updated  .

on jun 28 , 2009  .

this is easily the best hddvr that i've ever used , and i've had directv and comcast previously  .

not only is the monthly cost far less exuberant , but the dvr itself is a superior machine  .

user friendliness is a big deal for me , since my roommate is what you might call technologically illiterate , but even he can utlize all of the functions on this receiver  .

the 722 model 350 hours of stock availability compared to dtv's crappy 150 and comcasts even crappier 100  .

also , this receiver has many functions that are a godsend  .

you can literally record three programs at one time while simultaneously watching a 4th pre    recorded program  .

its unbelievable  .

as i've already stated , i've had several dvrs before through other companies and this one is easily the best i've ever used .

if you want a state of the art dvr look no further  .

this will take your tv watching to another level i have had all the other dvrs  .

nothing compared to dishes 622\722 .

thanks dish keep up the superb work .

i just upgraded to the vip 722  .

the choice is easy and i have no regrets  .

i had directtv before i switched to dish sd  .

i is much more impressed with dish , hands down  .

dish suited my channel choices much better than direct  .

then after six months of sd , i bumped up to hd  .

on my vizio 37 lcd , i get a great picture from hd and the sd is not bad either  .

the completely user friendly basic function is great for even my 5 year old  .

she can easily find her recorded sponge bob's in 2 seconds flat  .

plus the ability to fine tune and take full advantage of the vip 722's high end features is easy to find and set up for a technofile like me  .

my girlfriends brother has driect hd and i find that the picture quality is exactly the same , the programming on direct , for my likes , is lacking and the user interface and remote are much more convoluted on direct the dvr storage and retrieval on dish is perfect  .

i can scan the progams list , my recordings and menu with ease  .

the dvr is phenominal  .

i have not had a single complaint or issue with dish at all .

i have both a tivo and the vip722 and the 722 in my opinion blows it away  .

the picture quality is much better , it has an rf remote , 30 sec skip and ability to watch record 3 shows .

i have had the 622 for close to 2 years now  .

aside from my 50 industrial panasonic hdtv monitor , there is no high tech toy that has given me greater pleasure  .

the optical outlet enables me to connect to my older av receiver for dts or 5  .

1 sound  .

dish really did a great job on this one  .

i had directv before and their recievers are slow responding , small recording times , and picture quality isnt as good as this reciever  .

this will also hook up via your network  .

this utilizes updates and dish on demand hooked up to a toshiba 47inch lcd    hdmi  .

optical audio to sony reciever  .

amazing sound  .

4 months in and i have still not had to delete ne thing i did not want to  .

the capacity destroys the competition .

have had the same dvr box since july 2008 just in time for the olympics and never and i mean never had a problem with it  .

never had tivo so i cannot compare the 2 .

the best in the recording option , because you dont loose any program and you pause live tv for any reason (phone , ring bell anything) and you dont loose you show  .

although i know very little about dvrs from tivo or direct tv , etc  .

, i cannot think of any feature the 722 lacks  .

although one has to pay a one time fee of less than $40 for enabling the archiving capability , i consider it well worth the money updated  .

on jan 6 , 2009  .

i have active a vip722 hd dvr on september 4 2007 and my experiency with this tecnology is great  .

all feature is very good  .

no trouble  .

is a perfect equipment .

very good unit  .

i had direct's standard definition dvr and it took forever to move through the menu  .

dish's dvr is fast  .

also dish's multiple room concept with one unit is a smart money saving idea only negative for this unit in comparison to direct's unit , is the awkward means to search for movies and favorite stars  .

direct tv unit have built    in list and all you have to do is click on a star and the unit will find the programming .

i just took their hd only package which is just upgraded and contains most of the channels i ever watched with directv  .

only thing i'll miss from the zillion channel packages is fsn , but i'm hoping they'll make the multi    sports package available as an add    on (then this deal really becomes a 10)  .

overall , though , the picture and sound are impressive  .

since i have ota , my cost with the dvr is only $36 a month    has to be the best deal on the planet .

this is the easiest dvr i've ever used and i've tried several  .

the menu's are simple , the picture is great , and you can set things once and never worry about it again  .

you can even set a timer for one of your favorite programs and set it to record all  .

it will then record the program even if it airs on another channel , without recording the same episode twice  .

the box will operate two televisions or one with pip capabilities , and you can toggle between the two options  .

it records in hd and has external hard drive capabilities  .

the only drawback i can think of is that it does not broadcast to the second television in hd  .

dish network does not currently broadcast locals in hd in my market , but i called them to figure out how i could make that happen  .

i picked up a $40 antenna and ordered two $3 diplexers  .

the antenna mounts to the dish mounting on my roof (it's a ranch) and the diplexer allows you to combine the two signals so only one line is going into the house  .

then the second diplexer goes on the inside and splits the signal back out to the two jacks on the box  .

best part is that you can record three programs at once now  .

two signals off the dish and one from the antenna  .

my girlfriend lives in an apartment building and is thus relegated to cable  .

she has the cable dvr and i cannot begin to explain how inferior the cable dvr is to my 722  .

the hard drive is limited , there is no widescreen epg , and it is very sluggish to respond to remote control commands  .

worst of all the cable dvr does not have a 30 second skip forward button  .

the 30 second skip forward button on my 722 is perfect for zapping commercials  .

it beats the heck out of fast forwarding and then overshooting i have not tried a tivo box to make a comparison to that  .

i went with dish's 722 because it got such good reviews and it is a free upgrade  .

i do not regret my decision  .

can wait to get a new one with more capacity on the hd .

set up is very easy  .

the unit comes with a usable all subscribed channels list  .

there are 4 user assignable favorites list  .

search defaults to the all subscribed list which contains sports packages and ppv  .

this list can be edited with channel locks , lock ppv and hide locked options  .

after setting up locks the dvr will only search and record unblocked channels creating tivo    like wish lists can be done through the remote   2 button is a , b , c 3 is d , e , f  .

being able to key the search terms really speeds search time  .

there a myriad of other recording options which all work for home theater users the remote comes preprogrammed to operate tv , receiver and vcr/dvd  .

this can be accomplished manually or automatically  .

volume default is assignable  .

when it determines which code works the tv , the dvr automatically adjusts the picture output to match the tv at either 480i , 480p , 720p or 1080i on screen guide has seven different customizations so you can choose font size and number of channels to display with or without picture  .

other dvrs limit the display to a very short 4 or 5 lines there is a pip feature that allows you to view two satellite pictures at the same time in a variety of different formats , including split screen this dvr replaced a short lived competitor's dvr which replaced a 7 year old tivo with a large hard drive  .

so far the vip722 has the best software package .

since writing our previous review (under the vip622) , we've had a bit more time  .

and guess what , we had to have them send a replacement 722 because a minor hardware problem    we started getting a jumping freeze frame with normal audio  .

but their tech support has been great , so we are not downgrading our rating the hd picture is incredible  .

and , in fact , we just watched the new law order ci on usa    non    hd but wide screen and the picture is incredibly clear for digital standard definition tv compared to our older dish receiver    recorders we still use also , we added a western digital mybook essential 750gb external hard drive which expands the storage capacity of the system to what appears to be about 100 hd movies  .

(if you choose to do this , do not buy the mybook premium edition as it has some nifty things you might want for your computer , but not for this use) here's our original review    .

we have been echostar (dish network's parent company) satellite tv service customers since 1988  .

the company tries to provide , and generally succeeds in providing , adequate , competitive service  .

based on our own experience when we had two homes plus on the experience of friends and family , dish network's service is on a par with , if not better than , cable service and directtv  .

keep in mind for any of them   sometimes the magic works and sometimes it doesn't  .

with that said , we did not leap into dish hd even though we've had a 42 inch hd plasma tv since 2003  .

the reason is simple , we live in the redwoods and most of the initial dish hd signals were on satellites we cannot see  .

(the satellite companies are clear    lacking an unobstructed southern sky view can be a problem for service , a problem not found in cable service  .

) we still cannot get some of the hd service we theoretically are paying for because of this  .

but almost every hd feed we'd like to see we now can  .

(we also waited a few months for the release of the vip722 because it is black as are the other components in our home theater system  .

since we were adding to our dish network standard definition service (keeping our existing two receiver/recorders active) , we knew what we were getting into  .

if you are new to satellite tv browse the links at http  //www  .

dbstalk  .

com/ and particularly the dish network info at http  //ekb  .

dbstalk  .

com/  .

things went pretty much as expected  .

we called the dish network number and explained we wanted to add an hd 722 receiver/recorder to our existing two feeds    four feeds total  .

the woman took the order without needing alot of explanation and but she gave an incorrect price which she couldn't get straight , but oh well three days later two installers wearing shirts with the dish logo arrived in a old , but well maintained , unmarked pickup  .

one spoke only spanish , but the other who is the lead is fluently bilingual  .

(my spanish is comparable to george bush's so i speak english but listen carefully  .

) the lead installer discussed his flawed work order with me , called his supervisor to get permission to do what we had ordered  .

installation went well  .

but , you need to know that we had the cables to our theater system hooked up with the end plugs for the vip722 waiting on the shelf for the installer to plug in  .

he will likely not have with him more than rca's for composite video and two channel sound and an s    video cable  .

we have hd component connections and an optical surround sound connector to our theater system , plus an s    video and rca stereo to our additional room distribution box  .

he activated the system which resulted in most signals being activated before he left , but some (local channels for instance) took another three hours  .

(we knew this would happen from previous experiences with changing our programming  .

even though we had prevous service with older (508) recorders , the menu's for the 722 are complex and require some deciphering , the adequate operating manual notwithstanding  .

for us , the dish tech portal at http  //tech  .

dishnetwork  .

com/departmental_content/techportal/content/tech/receiver/722  .

shtml is very helpful  .

nonetheless , after about two weeks of setting it up like we want it , the hd picture and 5  .

1 sound is as good as our dvd player provides (no we don't have brand new hd or bluray) and certainly as good as we are ever going to be able to appreciate for us , several consideration were involved  .

even though we did not have cable service available when we first moved here , we now have comcast which is our high speed internet service provider  .

we had comcast in our other home and two of our adult kids have comcast  .

we have no problem with comcast but it would be more expensive and they are just now upgrading to be able to offer hd in the future  .

we could have gotten a huge new customer discount from directtv , but directtv's packages are not what we want (we are not big sports enthusiasts) and they are just beginning the process of providing hd  .

additionally , no other service has provided the state    of    the    art recording technology as reliablly as dish  .

some people prefer tivo , but that appears to be a personal preference  .

we do have rare weather related signal losses  .

but our cable system goes down more frequently and in a power outage it simply goes down  .

with satellite our battery backup lasts long enough for us to start up our generator without losing service and programs being recorded  .

in a two or three day power outage which does occur every four or five years , this is a big plus .

i love the product but had one fail about 9 months ago  .

i don  .

t recall how long it ran before it failed  .

i do not feel it's right that dish wants customers to pay to insure their equipment or you deal with repair costs if you don  .

t pay the monthly insurance fee  .

when the unit failed 9 mo  .

ago the tech rep put the monthly insurance on and said take it back off once i get the new unit  .

9 mo  .

later the next unit failed  .

they did the same thing only now they charge a $25 fee if you cancel the $6/mo insurance before 5 months  .

this may seem off topic but it is pertinent because based on my experience , it's not unlikely that you'll have to have the unit replaced at some point and you will be using it with dish .

generally , i have been very impressed with this receiver  .

but there are several control functions that are a real pain  .

i happen to be hard of hearing and often want to switch the close caption on or off  .

to do this it takes an unbelievable 17 button pushes to either turn the closed caption on or off not quite as bad , but to time record (dvr) a program or delete a program it seems like one has to go thru an unecessaryly large number of navigations before you can get the job done  .

and , there is no way one can stop a recording once it has started  .

you simply have to wait it out  .

on the postive side , i really like the 30 second skip and 10 second reverse skip feature on the recorder also , i liked the dual hd output capability (hdmi and component)  .

with this i is able to connect our hd tv in our living room with the component output while using a 50' hdmi cable (yes , hdmi can be that long  .

) to our bedroom hd tv  .

and , of course , i have used tv2 to pipe analog tv throughout our house to other analog tvs , all with just the one 722 receiver .

this is my first dish dvr  .

i is a longtime cable dvr user , and i am very disappointed at no longer being able to watch one live show (on each tv) and record another (on each tv)  .

this is a huge oversight by whoever designed these dvr units  .

the whole point of being able to time shift is   not tying up your tv with whatever you are recording with the cable company's scientific atlanta box , for example , i could record 2 shows and watch a 3rd live tv show simultaneously , no problem  .

i could even pause and rewind the live tv show i is watching with dish dvr , you cannot do that  .

if you are recording 2 shows (one on the tv1 tuner , and one on the tv2 tuner) , then you can not watch live tv at all  .

the act of recording essentially ties up the each tuner this is a huge drawback , and if i had known about it in advance , i might have stuck with cable  .

i don't want to have to plan my evenings around what's on live tv , versus what i want to record  .

i often record two shows at once while watching tv  .

dvr recording is supposed to happen in the background , it's not supposed to conflict with the same tuner (s) that you use to watch tv  .

they should be  completely  separate i cannot stress that enough  .

this is inexcusable in fact , i specifically asked dish if you could watch live tv on both tuners , while recording two shows at the same time  .

they told me you can  .

(i have it in an email)  .

so , either they lied , or their employees don't know their own products  .

either way , i don't care  .

this is a big deal , and it's very poor design choice to omit this  .

it is a huge disadvantage over other companies' dvrs essentially , because the dvr shares the tuners with the live tv , my family now has to schedule what we watch on live tv  around  stuff we want to record  .

that is so backwards it is not funny anyhow , barring that , the rest is not all bad  .

the picture quality is terrific  .

and (assuming no one in the house has scheduled any dvr recordings) , being able to pause and rewind two tvs , while watching live tv on each , is wonderful the menu is a little clunky and unintuitive  .

i often find myself having to start over or hit cancel , because it turned out what i wanted is in a different part of the menu it also seems rather silly , but as high    tech as it is , this thing still complains when it cannot find a connection to a telephone landline  .

i have it connected to my high    speed internet via ethernet cable  .

yet , it still tries to make outgoing telephone calls  .

none of the customer service options function via internet  .

it just says could not detect phone line and there is no way for me to tell it there's no phone , use the internet instead  .

what a software ui gaffe i once scheduled a recording of one tv show , (i had once selected , not all , and not first run  .

i  promise   .

) , only to find that it had decided to schedule dvr timers for about 16 instances of that show  .

i had to delete them all one by one  .

what a pain also , it is rather slow to change channels  .

it literally takes ~5  .

5 seconds to change a channel  .

i just timed it , doing three trials using a chronograph  .

this is not a deal    breaker for me , but it does make channel    surfing a chore  .

you can avoid this by using the guide to channel    surf , but it still means a 5  .

5 second delay if you're using recall to jump back and forth between two shows  .

having switched from cable , that 5  .

5 seconds feels like an eternity  .

i have to tell myself , this is what i'm giving up in exchange for the savings  .

in fact , my experience with this box , in general , has been fraught with telling myself just that   this is what i am putting up with , in exchange for the [theoretical] cost savings over cable  .

some of  the technology in this dvr is definitely impressive  .

the ability to add external storage is a no    brainer that will certainly come in handy  .

the ability to connect to the internet (not an issue for cable , since they can stream content to you via the cable    but brilliant for a satellite company) is sure to add some value  .

and of course , running two tvs off one box is very slick indeed  .

fewer box rental fees is always a good thing they just need to make it so that you can watch live tv while recording shows , on both tuners  .

if this means adding 2 more tuners to the box , then so be it  .

that's what they need to do  .

that is what the designers of a well    designed , well    thought    out dvr box would have done  .

this implementation is a half    measure  .

however , it may be a half    measure you can live with i know there is no perfect solution currently on the market , and i admit , this box is right up there in the upper echelon of the as close to perfect as currently exists in 2010 category  .

as    is , this dvr box could be an ideal solution for you , if you do not mind tying up your tvs' ability to watch live shows while you're recording .

great dvr and easy to use  .

after living with tivo on directv for 6+ years , we moved to dish for hd , because the directv dvr gets such terrible reviews  .

the vip722 does the job , but it's much harder to use than tivo reliability has been very good , and after 2 months we've only had to re    boot once when it mysteriously decided not to stop showing any hd channels  .

it's fast and responsive , though the remote control is sluggish and plastered with buttons    we still get confused by it sometimes  .

it comes (at least as of dec 2007) with a 500mb disk which records some 55 hours of hd or 300 hours of sd the user interface is definitely not intuitive and continues to leave us occasionally lost  .

the dual tuners and dual tv outputs in their default setup is simply baffling    what were they thinking  .

once you switch it off , things start behaving in a sane way , i  .

being able to record 2 hd programs at once , transparently while it's been very reliable , there aren't any features on this that tivo did not do even better , and more intuitively  .

but for now , this seems to be the best non    cable hd dvr you can get .

i like this receiver because you can record tons of movies , documentaries , etc  .

that are easily found for replay with a library you set up to meet your personal style  .

it allows you to direct your recordings to either its built in large capacity hard drive or an extemely high capacity external hard drive you provide  .

ordering a ppv with your remote is a snap with just an internet connection to the back of the receiver and i think the hd quality is superior to a cable box  .

hd for free is another big plus .

i have a vip722 hd dvr and a tivo second generation dvr , if you put it side by side , even with the second generation tivo dvr the vip722 doesnt measure up  .

tivo is much better , the on screen programing for tivo is better , the vip722 just feels like a plain jane dvr , i'm not impressed one bit , i feel if you never had a dvr before , then you will like the vip722 , but if you have had tivo before , then your not going to like it to much , i feel babied with tivo , but with the 722 , i feel its just a plan jane dvr , sure its hd , and it has a large hard drive , but when i go to purchase a movie from dish network , it only gives you 24 hours to watch it , then it locks out the movie  .

and with tivo if you record it , it stays on your tivo till you delete it , so its kind of like ordering a movie from amazon , amazon only will give you 24 hours to watch it with tivo  .

so like i said i guess im spoiled with tivo i feel  .

but again , if you want a good dvr then buy the vip722 hd dvr , it will work fine , but you dont get the features that tivo offers , and thats what i like , is those tivo features  .

well there you go , my 2 cents worth , take it for what you will , and enjoy your dvr no matter what one you have  .

i only downrated this one because of the early life failure (no received signals from either dish    standard or hd)  .

luckily , it just barely made it through the olympics  .

hopefully the replacement lasts a lot longer  .

i had no problems over two years with the previous receiver .

let me start out by saying that i have a lot of experience with designing user interfaces , and have tons of years of computer experience (inside and outside the box)  .

i am not a newbie with user interfaces i will describe in detail the problems i have had with my vip722    .

1) the unit has been unstable   i just had problems today (and it is not the first time)  .

i have owned my vip722 for about 1 1/2 years now  .

i have run into multiple situations where the vip722 will randomly lock up / reset / freeze / or have sound only but no picture  .

this morning , i is surfing channels , and i suddenly saw a blank screen and channel #65535 for every channel i chose , and it is the channel number shown for every channel in the program guide  .

i had to reset the unit to clear out the issue  .

i have also had the unit go through multiple resets on boot    up , where it may constantly reboot for 5 to 10 times before it finally comes up  .

something is flaky    software , hardware , or both 2) dvr programming interface   without a doubt , this is the absolute , hands    down worst user interface i have seen for a dvr  .

i have used about 4 others (sagetv , tivo , directtv , cable) , and all of their user intefaces are much better  .

when i am trying to record a single show of a series (say , next week's 'nova' episode in hd) , it is almost impossible to figure out how to do it through the user interface  .

do i press dish pass or timer  .

i have actually called up dish network technical support on this multiple times , and the vip722 doesn't handle it very well at all  .

i is always told by the technical support staff that the only way i could do that is to go to the program guide , navigate to the channel / time that the program is being shown , and then press the record button when the show is highlighted  .

every other dvr i have used supported this functionality , and it is accomplished through the programming menu  .

if i want to record a single episode of something 2 weeks from now , i may have to scan through a hundred or more program guide pages before i get to the show of interest (if i know what day it is playing) in addition , figuring out how to adjust specific settings for a recording is almost impossible to figure out  .

if i want to change a planned recording so that i start recording 2 minutes earlier for that show , i usually waste about a half    hour before i finally figure out which screens i need to get to note   i have recently found that dish network's remote access via a pc works very well , and gets you much easier and more capable programming of your dvr  .

i no longer use the dvr programming menus in the vip722  .

i only use the web interface now , and am eagerly awaiting the release of an android app for remote access 3) menu navigation is painful   for some reason , dish has assigned 'secret button sequences' in order to get to some screens  .

for example , you may need to press the 'dvr' button twice to get to a specific screen  .

useless and annoying  .

how is i supposed to know to press the dvr button twice  .

it was not on the menu screen , and it is not on the remote  .

(it is mentioned in the 146 page manual , though)  .

more significantly , the names of their menu selections aren't clear enough that you get to where you think you wanted to go  .

many times , i find myself going back to the main menu to try again 4) records stuff you do not want   if you select a 'dishpass' to record only 'new' programs , be ready to delete a whole bunch of stuff  .

i have a dishpass to record only new 'daily show' episodes , and the vip722 will record every old episode that is not listed with a specific original recording date  .

in addition , i have set the vip722 to record only 'new' showings of a special event (like a battlestar galactica tv movie) , and the vip722 will record every instance of the event  .

that will fill up your hard drive quickly  .

again , i have  never  had these problems with any other manufacturers' dvr i have used in the past .

overall , this is a great dvr  .

very simple to set up and operate  .

my parents had directv , and they liked my dvr so much that they switched to dish  .

the onscreen guide is very intuitive , and the remote is the best i've ever used  .

so good that i decided not to buy the multi    function remote that i had planned to get on the downside , the hardware reliability is terrible  .

in the 14 months that i've had this , my first dvr lasted 8 months , and the second one just died today after about a month of problems with the hard drive  .

to their credit , dish is sending an installer out tomorrow with a new unit , but i had to talk to a supervisor to get it  .

word to the wise   back up the shows you want to watch on an external hard drive rather than the internal .

dish network does not know their own product  .

in the course of switching to this unit from a direct tv/tivo i had seven people at the company , including three installers , tell me point blank that the unit would not allow pausing live tv on the two tuners and switching between them  .

some of them said they'd never heard of such a thing  .

some of them said that it would not do that if you chose to make the dvr accessible to a second television all of them were wrong and the only way i determined this is by reading cnet's review before going to the dish website as for user experience , it's mixed    .

image quality  .

the direct tv signal provided marginally better quality for non    hd viewing than dish does  .

didn't have hd with direct so i cannot compare that    user interface  .

i've used tivo for a few years now and thought it is brilliant from the first hour  .

what a shame dish could not have incorporated some of those principles in to their software    remote  .

ditto  .

a blizzard of buttons spread out in ways that put the controls for associated functions in awkward places and the way those buttons control those functions is frequently badly thought    out    two rooms can access the same content    as tivo no longer supports two satellite inputs and so will not time    shift two tuners it's only suitable for cable subscribers , so it's no longer a solution for sat  .

customers , so our only choice is between dish and direct tv  .

and from what i've heard direct's ui , remote and dvr are even worse .

this receiver , is only a digital off    air receiver (unlike my previous 811 which had both analog and digital receivers)  .

for that reason , i cannot receive some distant stations since the digital signal is too weak (analog used to work fine) secondly , the integration of the local off    air stations into the program guide does not work  .

i cannot tell what is playing on the local , over    the    air stations  .

the guide simply displays digital service  .

perhaps this is a bug in the system .

it does provide a pretty picture when it is working and the interface is simple enough  .

the signal from the second remote worked sporadically until someone told me how to rig a pigtail on the antenna  .

if only the other problems were so easily resolved  .

we are on our 5th unit and i am writing this as i sit waiting for a tech to show up  .

three of these machines were afflicted with intermittent freezes , one lost all dvr function and one replacement arrived doa  .

the problems are frustrating however , and doubly so with dish network tech support insisting that this is their most reliable unit  .

the tech will probably gives us our 6th box today , but if that one doesn't work , i wo not have a 7th in the house .

went to dish network because versus is dropped from directv  .

the directv remote and on screen guide are much easier to operate , but neither are as good as tivo  .

i hope that dish decides to revamp the whole guide/record method to make it more tivo/directv easy  .

if you want great dvr buy tivo  .

i had tivo for 5 years and this pos vip722 for about a year  .

anyone that says this dvr is great has never used tivo .

all you really need to understand   network is to watch an episode of charley chat , a program featuring folksy dish ceo charley ergin and his hokey side    kick what's    his    name  .

these clowns take carefully screened calls and answer questions from customers  .

yeah , maybe  .

anyway , when you see how lame this billion    dollar company looks , you will definitely want to consider cable or directv  .

i prefer my executives to be properly dressed , not looking like they're on their way to a monster truck rally  .

and , yes , dish network is run like a maw    and    paw convenience store , with 3rd grade graduates manning the customer service and technical operations  .

this actually happened   dish customers were having problems with their hd dvrs , contacted the tech department , who did not have a clue how to fix the problem , in denial the whole time , and blaming the customers themselves  .

guess what  .

the solution is posted on an internet site called avs for a month and customer service is still clueless  .

it works       most of the time setting up a recording is unnecessarily difficult  .

instead of being forthright with their terms , they decided to get cute  .

instead of setting up a recording , one sets up a timer  .

and it insists on recording every single episode of that program no matter how frequently it is broadcast (some cable companies will rebroadcast a show 4 times in 24 hours or more , and this machine wants to record them all  .

you can change it , but the default is to record them all  .

) and occasionally , it will decide that it can no longer find the satellites even though the satellites haven't moved and the dish receiver is still where it always was  .

and it will take five to ten minutes to reprogram itself  .

annoying under most circumstances ; but when it's the final five minutes of a football game when the teams are 3 points apart and the looser is driving toward the goal , annoying does not adequately describe the outage all in all , i'd say this is a very inferior piece of equipment  .

and the only reason i use it is because i cannot find anything else which will work with dish network .

i hardly know where to begin when describing the problems  .

the digital audio cuts off intermittently from the unit  .

the unit is not intelligent enough to allow you to watch tv on the unused tuner when you switch programs  .

it requires a reboot whenever it downloads the program guide  .

half the time , when i turn it on , it starts looking for a satellite signal (something it could have done when it is in standby)  .

the user interface is downright ugly compared to the scientific atlanta box i had with twc  .

the problems are a shame , given dish's great hd lineup and the hardware specs of this box  .

whatever dish executive is responsible for this calamity of a dvr should be fired , and they should outsource the work to someone who really knows what they are doing .

i ordered to upgrade to a vip722 and agreed to a 24 months contract  .

what i got is vip622 (a 4 yr old model with less capacity)  .

when i complain to their customer service , they say they do not guarrantee the availability of the vip722  .

when i ask to wait until they have the vip722 , they do not have a good answer  .

the bottom line is dishnetwork will insist in giving you their old box even if you insist  .

i is told to buy an external hard drive to increase the capacity of the vip622  .

the problem for is i will spend another $150 for the external hard drive and dish network will charge me another $40 to activate the external hard drive  .

if you order a new subscription with a contract , be sure to ask their customer service to guarrantee to get what you ordered .

bottom line  .

dish support is told to lie and claim they do not know of any problems  .

that is impossible , since all my neighbors have the same troubles with the box  .

the bottom line is dish tv said and is still saying that their dvr is better than tivo  .

nothing could be further from the truth  .

i used tivo for almost ten years and is drawn in by dish with empty promises and discount contracts when i switched to hd  .

now i wish i had never heard of dish  .

listen to me save yourself some frustrating times ahead and dont get dish network  .

their customer support are so bad you will regret ever getting their service  .

we paid for their monthly equipment protection for 2 years and never used it , but when the dvr over heated , they wont send us a new one oh , and , when you end service , you will need to get on the roof of your house to take down the dish and send it back  .

if you are not planning on getting on your roof , dont get dish network  .

we switched to dish this month to avoid paying the $279 directv wanted for an hd dvr  .

we had directv's tivo based receiver and it is far superior  .

the focus of all these machines frustratingly appears to be to record favorite tv shows  .

our main use is to have it record shows we don't know exist , by entering a keyword and asking it to autorecord , e  .

, an actor's name or subject  .

both dish and direct want you to first look at what's on their guide (only 9 days for dish and over 14 for direct) but the only way to really accomplish this successfully is to by    pass that option and create a timer in dish or a keyword autorecord in direct  .

the dish installer had no idea this could be done and directv support haven't a clue either  .

i would like to not be dependent on cable/sattelite at all since we aren't network program viewers and do not subscribe to movie channels  .

we pick up what we like by keyword (timer) which usually turns up on bbcamerica , pbs , or a couple of network channels  .

when will this technology become civilised  .

the vip722 is the worst dvr i have ever gotten my hands on  .

i install home theaters for a living and can tell you this is absolutely the worst piece of equipment i have ever had to use  .

i want my tivo back  .

do not get this  .

you would be much more satisfied having 2 single tuner receivers than this , although the ui will be just as bad on those receivers , the upside is you will not have a degraded picture on your second tv .

in three years of having dish network i've had 5 or 6 622 dvrs break  .

i just got the vip722 dvr three months ago and it already broke .

from the word go we have had nothing but problems with dish and their equipment  .

i understand that you will trust cnet more than me , heck you don't know me  .

just be wary when you deal with them  .

we were told all of these great things about the system then learn the dvr really only works in one room as hd  .

the other tv has coaxial from the dvr going to it so it is not a hd signal and honestly is quite poor on the picture quality  .

today a dish network tech came to the house to inspect the dvr and i is told that due to my hard drive being about 45% full with recordings that is the reason i needed to reset the unit once a week due to the system freezing up  .

so i cannot use half the hard drive  .

well i could go off on a rant here but i wont just take my word for it and do not sign a contract with them  .

it is going to cost me over $200 to get out of the contract and no telling how much to get back with directtv  .

the only plus for this unit is that it can record up to 350 hours on sd i'm on my 5th unit since november of 2008    waiting for a field service manager 3 right now i'm an active participant in my tv viewing  .

if i'm watching a show and like it , i do searches for more , others similar or actors that are in a particular show  .

i like to search    as i'm watching shows    to see what's on     .

i could do all of this without problem on the 522  after a very short while    less than a week with a couple of the units , the unit slows down    more and more each time i search , set timers , etc  .

until it finally freezes up and shuts down  .

then , the unit just cycles on and off every 6    10 minutes i had to add the external hard drive so that i could keep all of the shows/movies safe  this unit has repeatedly set 3 and 4 timers to go off at the same time    it's designed to allow a maximum of 2 timers simultaneously  .

often , when i check history , it will display a show as done yet , when i check the my recordings , the show is not there  often , when i search with dish pass , it will come back with  .

results that are completely different    in every way    from the show i entered (for instance , a search for ncis (exact match) brought back    no results for fringe )  .

the back button is supposed to go back 10 seconds and , it often goes back up to as much as 10 minutes  in dish pass , i will set a show to record in standard definition    no particular station    and , it will show up in the timers to record in high def  some of the units have started the recordings as much as 10  .

minutes after the set time or just stopped recording before the  .

end of the show there are a number of other goofy issues dish people keep telling me that the problem is electrical  .

i believe that it is software related or a combination of software and less than adequate hardware (it's usually the lowest bidder that gets the job) i have 4 computers , tv , and two electronic sewing machines in this room and none of these have ever had a problem  .

never blown a breaker , either the dish 522 ran in the same spot    flawlessly    for about 5 years the 722k is plugged into an apc ups (uninterruptable power supply) because we get lots of brown outs and spurt power failures out in the country bottom line , i'm frustrated beyond frustration  .

i'm thinking that , when you are a hammer , everything looks like a nail dish people all want to blame it on electrical  .

if the issues is  .

electrical , why is the 722k the only thing that is having a problem  .

if you are a passive user/tv watcher , i guess the unit would  .

be fine if you like to surf/search/set timers/move things around    save your sanity and get something else .

once again dish terrible network has refused to replace or refund me for my equipment i sent to them in error  .

despite my filing a better busines bureau complaint , they simply offer an apology for inconvenience  .

they took my personal property and destroyed it without any notification to me , in any form , by any route  .

i mistakenly sent my dvd recorder with a hard drive to them  .

it looked similar to the dish receiver i is returning to them and i just packed the wrong one  .

they were both out of my media tower , which i is rearranging after switching to directv  .

they continue and adamantly refuse to compensate me or replace my dvd recorder with hard drive  .

they show a total disregard for other's personal property , yet would charge me without hesitation for keeping and destroying their property .

i recently switched from cable with tivo series 2 dvr's to dish network and their 722 dvr after having used the 722 for 5 months it is clear this box is no where near tivo first at night this box needs to power down to update  .

thats ok you can adjust the time , what i cannot stand is the box stays off till you wake it back up  .

i see no reason for this you cannot be updateing the box's os everynight to need this  .

second even though you can connect 2 tv's only one outputs in hd  .

if you have more then one hd tv too bad oh and try to get a second hd receiver  .

dish doesn't believe anyone needs more then on hd tv the main items i find that does not make this better then tivo    .

cannot send video to or from the box (tivotogo    tivocomeback)  .

no networking  .

nightly update power down (at least turn the box back on after any updates  .

on screen guide frequently has wrong information  .

another item i cannot get use to coming from cable is the lack of a digital display with time and channel number .
