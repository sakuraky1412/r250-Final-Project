the ps 2 can be summarized by the following    .
games  .
sexiness  .
superior graphics  .
controllers that actually fit my hands 5  .
games  .
games  .
great games library .
i love this ps2 unlike the clunky old one  .
if you have multiple friends or family members , this console is not for you since it only has two controller ports  .
thanks sony for this great redesign  .
this new slim look is pimp  .
and it comes with the network adapter thats hott  .
flawless .
i hate the review for the ps2 on cnet  .
it's stupid , look the new ps2 is smaller than any console and doesn't overheat  .
anyway the ps2 has a huge library of games since it came out in 2000 not only that it has hundreds of games from ps1  .
i don't know about you but i is one of 100 million that had a ps1 and i have lots of classic ps1 games it is true that compared to xbox and gamecube in graphics it's getting old  .
i look at it this way ps2 is being made to battle dreamcast (r  .
they did not know about xbox cause everyone thought it is a rumor or it is gonna play pc games only  .
so microsoft and nintendo had plenty of time to make their gpu's you know what though ps2 is approaching 100 million aswell , not bad for a system that has inferior graphics huh  .
anyway ps2 is the best console for what counts , games  .
xbox and gamecube can have the better graphics but at the end of the day it's all about the games and that's why ps2 is number 1 worldwide exclusives like grand theft auto whose controversy just increases the sales of it and ps2 , gran turismo and many more is what drives the success of ps2  .
i hope my review helps people see the bigger picture between ps2 and the competition .
great console , sony please manage to bring the magic back .
the ps2 slim is one of the best gaming rigs out there .
a good choice for newbies to gaming systems  .
i really love this system  .
i have since it came out  .
there's nothing bad i have to say about it , asside from the very awkward    shaped controllers .
for a casual gamer this is a great system , available cheap and the selection of games is astounding .

i have already received 60 gig ipod by doing this , and now i want to get my ps3 before christmas  .
you can too free and easy .
i recently traded in my old standard ps2 and bought this new slim one  .
boy , am i happy  .
it is so light  .
i travel to my friend's houses and bring my xbox 360 and my new slim ps2 and it is so easy to take with you  .
also , it looks nice and slim like a compact dvd player  .
it is no bigger than a hardcover book  .
it is thinner than a book , but about the same length  .
it is very quiet while playing , also it has a flip open disc tray  .
this style lets you control taking out disks rather than the console actually pushing the tray in and out  .
great upgrade and outstanding value  .
even offer a usb key entry  .
the ps2 should have done that small at the beginning .
the slim form boasts a definite cosmetic improvement (including a silver version if you're tired of black) , taking up less space at the expense of an additional cord  .
the only flaw is the disc tray , which loads from the top  .
the door opens at a very narrow angel , making it difficult to put in the disc especially if you have large hands  .
the door also feels like it can easily be snapped off with an accidental jolt of the hands aside from the cosmetic difference , the machine still performs the same  .
the real appeal of the ps2 is its impressive game library and cheap price  .
if you've never owned a ps2 before and are interested , pick one up .
the ps2 is one of my favorite systems  .
it brought the gta games resident evil games and tomb raider (legend not the other one)games back to life and allowed you to play dvds  .
it is a huge step from ps1 and proves once again that sony knows what there doin  .
the ps2 slim is a very nice , good looking very small compact system  .
although , the door is not very good , mine got accidently ripped off from my little brother , it would not work after that  .
i cannot wait till the new colors come out late this year , alien green , powder blue , blue , pink , and other colors aswell , with matching conrtollers and memory cards  .
also the price is going down to $100 and games are only going to be 9  .
99    39  .
99 dallors by autum  .
i would reccomend this consle , but it's going to be dead soon from nex gen consles .
sony did a great job downsizing the playstation , we bought this slim model after our first (larger model) one stopped reading discs  .
we've had this ps2 for a little under a year , and it has hardly ever frozen  .
the library of games is expansive , and the greatest hits titles are a great price  .
with the release of the ps3 , newer titles such as madden are sure to drop in price  .
internet setup seems to be easy with the built in ports  .
i do not like the top    loading tray , it's flimsy , but with the console being so small , it'd be hard to put a stable tray in it also  .
also , the power converter can get hot , but it has never posed a threat  .
the only problems that the ps2 really has are because of how much it is hindered by its size  .
they could've also matched the xbox's capabilities with this redesign .
the ps2 is an intuitive and breathtaking console with a killer price  .
its small form makes it perfect for the dorm room or the person with minimalist tastes  .
a huge library of games makes it a fun system for all people to play  .
though the graphics may look dated by 2006 standards , those of us who look beyond the graphics to the gameplay and the true essence of the game are seldom dissapointed .
ps2 is a good system for a family  .
there are sports and racing games for kids , and exiting shooters for teens and parents .
been out of console video games for a few years because i is taking college seriously  .
but wow  .
there's a lot of cheap ($20 or less) quality games for ps2  .
if this is what's like for ps3 5 years after its launched , i might wait for the ps3 to be under $200 to get it  .
and get quality $20 games all in all i dont really care that much about the graphic of the games  .
i tried to play xbox360 ncaa football 07 and playing the ps2 version  .
all it's different it's the graphic , and the gameplay remian the same  .
so , do not be a graphic fetish and you'll spend less money and still get a good gameplay  .
ps2 have alot of games for me to explored , beyound the launch of playstation 3  .
the only bad things about ps2 is i cannot play halo , and zelda  .
but i might end up getting all the current    gen console anyway , after the price goes way down (i'm talking $50 or less) , yep , i'm a budget gamer  .
i got the slim ps2 because my fat ps2 broke , and i wanted to play gta   san andreas  .
its a really great system , not much different than the fat ps2 other than the fact that its slim and has less problems than the original ps2  .
the top opening disk    drive seems clumsy and makes you think you may break it for how fragile it seems  .
just but it if you dont already have a ps2 .
this is really the most compact and practical of current    gen consoles  .
at 3 lbs less than ps2 , it retains all the same gameplay flaws as ps2  .
294  .
9 mhz processor is nothing compared to gamecube (485) and xbox (733) , although the toshiba sony emotion engine is better than the bm powerpc gekko (nintendo) if at equal rates  .
less than 1/2 the cache memory of xbox and 1/6 of gamecube  .
gamecube , xbox , and even dreamcast came online ready out of the box , so this is less an improvement , as much as it is maintenance the hdd slot is useless , unless you want to save your games on a hard drive and not carry all of them around  .
the slim ps2 has 2 usb ports , but neither is compatible with an external hdd  .
sony probably did this to cut down on game pirating , which can easily be done with hdloader (not endorsing pirating , it is stealing , you can be prosecuted , and it is very cheap and easy)  .
also , you cannot save your memory card files with the slim ps2 (requires hdd utility disc) , but this can be remedied with another memory card still dvd and cd compatible , though the disc drive is kind of lame  .
i prefer not having to bend    up my discs to get them out of the console , but it's cool , whatever  .
it is unsure whether the new version will actually overheat  .
the base will get fairly hot after 1    2 hours , but it could just be hot and not overheating  .
the lack of open space (which contributes to over 50% of the volume in a ps2) is the most likely cause  .
having no on/off switch in the back is weird , but i like the idea of making the reset and eject buttons blend in with the ridges all in all , if you have already purchased an xbox or gamecube and want to try playstation , this is a good console (actually , the only console)  .
its only real difference from the original ps2 is being compact  .
an online adapter can be bought used for $0  .
99 at eb  .
online experience is horrible though  .
it's not as bad as nintendo's , but xbox love leaves everyone else in the dust  .
if you do not already own a playstation product , the games are a perk  .
seriously , what's so special about halo (interactive star trek) or smash bros (it's alright , i guess)  .
madden and kingdom hearts is where it's at  .
also , xbox and gamecube controllers suck .
if you can only buy one system there is only one choice as to what to buy   playstation 2  .
while it maybe not have the best graphics , it has without a doubt the best library of games over all the genres  .
if you are wonder what system will likely get a particular game you can easily assume ps2 will get the game  .
the systems only flaw is ist online functionality  .
the lack of an integrated online service is unfortunate , but given taht only 20% of console owners currently have broadband though and isp its is easy to see why such a function is a low priority this generation  .
with that said some of the most popular online games ever appeared on ps2 , so it hard not to admit sony did exactly what it needed to and no more finally , if you are reading this you are likely in the market to buy a pstwo , so i will just say go ahead  .
unlike xbox or gamecube , the sony pstwo will see continued support for the next few years  .
even now the system is a worthwhile long term investment .
fairly good , small console , fast load times .
its a great product  .
the slim design is soo much better than the large version  .
it gets hot but this is a common problem in alot of game systems and other electronics  .
my fan is getting loud but its nothing to bothersome  .
plus i'm sure if you actually clean it once in a while you'll be fine  .
its brought me hours and hours of entertainment  .
it plays ps1 and ps2 games , cd's , dvd's you cannot really ask for much more  .
i choose it over nintendo and microsoft becuase of sony's great reputation and i am not dissapointed .
well the ps2 is definatly one of the best , the graphics are awesome , and the gameplay and sounds of the games are very good , i would also suggest waiting for ps3 before getting a xbox360  .
i think this is a great product  .
you dont need an expansion slot for a ps2 unless you want faster loading times  .
i cannot wait for the ps3 though it has a blue ray disk reader and the media is 54 gb  .
okay , i'm a playstation fan , and i'll admit it  .
but ps2 is the best console in terms of power , size and choice of games  .
there is no other console that exceeds the library of games available for ps2  .
its really slim ; it would fit inside a backpack easily if you intend on bringing it around  .
its controllers aren't as big as xbox's (especially the first ones    it is huge  .
) while some might complain that its processor speed is too slow or its graphics aren't as good as xbox , think again  .
xbox might offer you a better graphics , but you pay , as a consequence , the size  .
you cannot make it stand upright ; it would fall on itself  .
you have to put it sideways    and it takes up a space comparable to a 17 widescreen laptop  .
which is more useful    a laptop or a xbox  .
i think the answer is obvious  .
although i do like halo and halo 2 , that's virtually the only good games i like on xbox  .
mind you , i like all sorts of games but there isnt a lot of games that captures my eye on xbox but there is some flaw to the new slim ps2  .
i just plain hate this top    loading disc tray  .
it flaps open when you press the button  .
this makes it virtually impossible to make it vertical , 'cause the disc would fall out every time you open the flap  .
its best enjoyed lying somewhere safe where it cannot possibly topple over  .
i also do not like the fact that there is only two controller slots ; its boring to play against your brother all the time , even if my friends are over    they cannot all join in and play together  .
but i still like it , and i'm anxiously waiting for the launch of ps3 .
i have nothing against this fantastic console , just in the graphics department compare to its neighboring xbox which has a lot of processing power , 733 mhz vs  .
299 mhz but when it comes to games ps2 has no competition at all  .
see it for yourself visit your nearest video game stores    ) sometimes its not only the graphics count bro  .
junn  .
the new ps2 is just as good and fun as the old one .
if you don't already own a ps2 then buy this sucker , it's still a great gaming system and runs all games except for final fantacy 11 i think  .
if you already own a ps2 and it's still running fine do not bother getting this one , as long you're happy with it or if you're a final fantacy player  .
it also has built in ir for the playstation remote so you can watch your dvd's .
i love it the wide variety of games the graphics the options but only the one problem no place to put the 40g hard drive in to the new one there is no place to put it  .
other then that it is the best  .
if you have no ps2 but have been considering one , this a great time to get one  .
this ps2 is far quieter than the original  .
just as i is building a muffler for my old ps2 i saw this came out , and since i have 2 places where i play my ps2 , i thought it would be nice to have 2 ps2's so i got it and now i love it  .
it's so portable you can bring it to friends houses easily without worrying about it  .
its a little more of a pain to put cd's in since you have to depress them on the spindle , but it's more reliable than the old one with the motor that slides the cd trey out  .
in addition , this one includes networking , so i can get online and play my games too  .
no need for any add ons or pay services like the xbox  .
still just as fast but the quietness really makes the gaming experience better overall .
i bought 2 of these slim pstwos  .
one for my bro @ christmas and one for me 3 days ago  .
no overheating problem  .
the poer inverter is on the cord so that removes one heating element  .
the other is the new flip lid disk tray  .
i like it much better  .
less heat and moving parts is always a good thing  .
still not as powerful as my xbox or gc byt still has the best games .
if you like to game get this system  .
everything is good about it and games for it are really cheap  .
@5 for madden 08  .
also awesome graphics  .
but if you have the extra money get a 360 or a ps3 because it is kind of old  .
great buy  .
near perfect product , with a large selection of good and great games  .
online options are decidedly underwhelming , but many choices of great games otherwise .
overall , the ps2 is pretty great , but not awesome  .
cannot really name anything i specifically feel it lacks , but it fails to be really overly impressive .
hello , my name is cesar  .
i had purchased this console so that i can enjoy available console games entertain my friends with a stylish system this slim line ps2 is great  .
there are so many games available for this system , i am flat out impressed  .
the format is ultra compact , which is useful in my living room  .
when i purchased my ps2 , it also came with a vertical stand (glow stand)  .
once mounted my ps2 fits nicely beside our television stand  .
i am also amazed at how well this small system performs  .
i have had the slim line ps2 for a number of weeks now , and no overheating issues as of yet , although i have not put it to dvd use yet  .
i understand earlier play station systems had a problem with over dvd use  .
finally the ps2 looks sweet , and with great controllers its modern design and a stylish exterior make for a very impressive combination i would not expect such a compact system to have a hard drive , or many more controller ports , it is in an understandable condition  .
those options would be nice though  .
i also understand that some other systems can claim to have greater graphics , to some extent i feel this system has nicely delivered what i had expected , and more  .
for those considering a new console ; i recommend this play station 2 slim line  .
i also figure the game soulcalibur iii should come standard with the system , if you know what i mean cesar .
the playstation 2 , has brought us some of sony's greatest moments , modeled some of the best mascots , and is pretty darn' fun  .
the play station 2 offers many likeable features  .
for one , it has had a stronghold on the gaming market for over 5 years , although it's load time can be slow , the graphic quality can suprise you , especially if you are an xbox user  .
the ps2 tooks it's step in the 6th generation of gaming , and allows intense gaming  .
although , gaming is evolving rapidly , and since so the ps2 is created in 2000 , where the microsoft xbox and gcn (nintendo game cube or game cube network) is released a year later , and took a different hold  .
for example the gamecube had alot of young gamers interested because of the high amount in e games where the ps2 does have , but not as many , which is not suprising for nintendos stradegy , (a good one i might add) and the xbox commonly known as a computer undercover , had better graphics  .
although the ps2 has been prefeared by lots of rpg gamers , and action adventure sci    fi ones , and is the home for the final fantasy x , kingdom hearts , and more  .
i give this console an eight for it's sturdy gaming  .
the ps2 has come a long way since 2000 when it is realeased  .
the main strength of the console is down to the sheer number of games and not its graphics , but there are a ton of quality games for the platform which have a wide range of genres thanks to the hefty japanese developers support  .
the xbox is a great system but doesnt have the wide range of games the ps2 has , that is the bottom line games make a system not powerfull hardware .
after going through 4 of the old style ps2's in the span of a year i is beginning to think that my gaming relationship with sony is over  .
but i ran into the probllem that i still had a couple dozen games sitting on my shelf that i just coudn't play because ps2 #4 had just crapped out on me  .
frustrated i returned it to best buy with the trusty replacement plan and they gave me the new slim one  .
my first thoughts were oh great now it's a more breakable pos  .
but i have been much happier with this one  .
i got it around january and it's a good 7 months later and it still works like the day i bought it  .
this doesn , t mean that this unit is infinately better than the old one , though smaller it lacks a disc tray but goes for a top loading instead  .
i really would not care to much about that if there was not a useless button on my remote that i paid $15 for  .
my only other problem is how loud the system gets  .
maybe it's just mine but when it gets spinning (mainly on blue discs) it sounds like a plane is going over my house  .
i still have my doubts but hopefully i will have an overall better experience with this than my previous sony hardware .
going away to college i needed a gaming system that had a  .
affordability b  .
portability c  .
plenty of titles available  .
with the advent of the psp , it would seem that the slim ps2 would be come non existent , however the psp's price ($250) for a college student and ability to play on a tv monitor have its drawbacks  .
i'm not saying the new slim ps2 can stack up stat or feature wise to the psp or even the upcoming ps3 , however it is a great system for the money , especially for the gamer in need of space and price .
i bought the new slim line ps2 immediately when it is released and sold my original ps2 in the process  .
i could not believe how much smaller sony made it , i love it  .
sony did the same thing with the original playstation then the smaller ps one  .
i wish microsoft would do the same w/ the xbox for big black is a pregnant elephant compared to this mini system  .
i agree , the price needs to finally come down to the 100 level though  .
thanks sony  .
now if only we could get slim line colored ps2s  .
i love this product i would very much recomend this product to a friend or family  .
and i cannot wait until i get my hands on the new psp  .
if u have a xbox this is a great additional system  .
i got this system because i wanted guitar hero 2 and my sister wanted ddr  .
i am very happy with the game and pretty happy with the system  .
its a good system if you don't like the wii and do not want to shell out $600 for a ps3 or $400 for an xbox360 .
i just have one quiestion , can i use playstation2 (slim) for 6 or 7 hours with no problem  .
i mean , do i need condition air or some kind of ventilation machine for de ps2  .
the ps2 swept the gaming world when it came out  .
it is the first system to push the envelope for higher 3d performance and it remained one of the top consoles for a half the decade  .
since the ps2 has been around for a long time , no real updates have been made , the gamecube and xbox reign supreme in visual quality because they were releasesd afterwards still , the ps2 offers tons of hits , like gt4 , the whole grand theft auto series , and the final fantasy franchise which lured me in to buying the ps2 in the first place  .
the ps2 gets my 7 because it's good for the time being , because sony is planning on releasing the ps3 in the future  .
the new models are now slimmed down , which makes this a cooler purchase if you're demanding higher detailed graphics , and have the money , choose the new xbox at the moment  .
if you want some quick entertainment and want a huge collection of games , get the ps2  .
it's a matter of choice  .
i had bought a ps2 about 2 years ago  .
i dont know but some problem occurred in it  .
i went to the sony service center and they said that sony dont repair playstations  .
they said that if i had a warranty card they will replace it but they wont repair it  .
i found it absolutely weird  .
if you are selling something you should repair it as well  .
what about those customers whose ps2 are out of warranty  .
if their ps2 gives some problem then it wont be repaired  .
so my suggestion just as your warranty is about to expire exchange it otherwise out of warranty pariod it wont be repaired .
a small playstation 2  .
that's what the slim ps2 is  .
it could fit the size of both of your hands , it has a new 'pop up' disc tray , and everything is small  .
that's the 'massive' difference between a ps2 and a slim one  .
the shocking thing is , the ps2 uses more unhelpful ultilites , such as a guardian thingy and that is what is basicly is .
for the money's worth your getting here folks , your paying for what could of been done by a specialized or even bodge ps2 chipper the techies at sony ripped out the beast dust covered fan and replaced it with , wait for it nothing oh and , that really annoying whiring noise , well done , the fan does not make a noise  .
it aint there also  .
well done techies , you decided to take out the electronically controlled cd tray , that is actually a good idea , it got annoying from time to time and mine got stuck in the process of retreating back the new ps2 includes an all labour working console , and it's bringing back the rememberance of it's dead first brother , the psone , with the standard push to break switch controlling the shutter type tray apart from that  .
your paying for an anorexic ps2 with attitude and some rip off modifications .
i like it , but not as much as my gamecube and xbox  .
there are not really that many games on it that i care for , and the graphical quality is lacking , with the exception of mgs3  .
just no that great of a machine  .
the ps2 is a good , albeit underpowered , system  .
however , there is little point in buying this version , which doesn't even support the [near dead] hard disk drive if you're going to buy your first ps2 , and you want this to look good in your living room , buy this version  .
if you already own a ps2 , or don't care about looks , or do not want to spend a lot of money , just buy a normal ps2 .
i only bought this to play tekken 5 and it freezes a lot on that game and seems i cant play shinobe at all  .
this is completely unnaceptable  .
i have had this system for less than a week and i am ready to return it  .
good thing k    mart has a good return policy  .
gamecube here i come , tekken i will miss you .
i have 1 when u bump it it shuts off  .
always disk read error  .
xbox blows ps2 out of the water  .
ok so sony just made there other system smaller just like the ps1 but isnt this system just made even smaller than this , the psp  .
it has ps2 graphics , most ps2 games are coming to psp  .
lol its funny how sony trys to change an out dated system by making it smaller and making it so you dont need the network adapter , ill just wake up anyone who thinks this ps2 is the best its still the old 1 made to sell , ive already heard of heat problems on this little thing , its tooo skinny  .
, its like a starving system , give it some meat  .
, let it live or just buy the beefy xbox instead of getting this peice of crap  .

It is very small and compact also lightweight, It has a flip open disc tray (like a gamecube) and you can't get your game jammed in there if your power supply breaks, it fits into any home setup; Probably would break if it was accidentally dropped from 6 feet or more because of how thin it is.
The PS 2 is an amazing system. It is sexy, and performs exponentially better than its competition. Unfortunately I have not been able to build a system that matches the PS 2's superiority (or PS 3). Fortunately for me, I am a great marketer!!$$; This product has absolutely no cons. I sleep with it in my bed at night.
This PS2 is only a little bit larger than a PS2 game case!!! It comes with the online adaptor already in it when the old adaptor was bigger than this whole ps2.Disc tray is great and its very portable; None, although it would be better if it had a on/off switch rather than a standby mode. The small red light can be annoying to some.
Great Controller , Slim Factor very nice , The best Games of past generation , it just gave us so many great classic games, Mteal Gear Solid 3 , God Of War 1 and 2 , Gran Turismo 3 , Fatal Frame, Devil May Cry , Final Fantasy X , Ico,......etc; Limited DVD capabilities .....but seriously ,......all the cons that it has are washed away by all the great moments it gave me ....if it were not for the Snes this would be the best console ever
