Pros:. My Roku has always been useful but with the latest software it's much better. You can add to your Netflix queue or browse titles by category of search for a particular show.. 
Cons:. No wi-fi but we have a wired LAN which is more reliable than our wi-fi and faster. If you don't have a wired LAN then you need to put the Roku near your router.. 
Summary:. The main way they could improve this further would be to add categories or sub-directories for your Netflix queue. Once you have a couple hundred titles it's a pain to browse to what you want. Why not sort your horror into a separate category from your drama or action flicks? Why not let family members have their own instant watching queue? The latter may be due to Netflix but I can't see why the Roku couldn't keep your queue sorted into categories if you prefer it that way. A minor complaint as the newest software answered most of the drawbacks. You can do some of the same things with Play-On or a blu-ray player or a HTPC but I'll stick with the Roku as it does nearly everything. It even has an app that lets me control it with my iPod Touch in case I misplace the Roku remote.. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally a decent selection of on-demand programming!. A great value.. 
Cons:. Need more channels.. 
Summary:. I love my new Roku. Those of you that have comcast on-demand already know that the technology is pretty cool, but lets face it, the content sucks! Its not worth the money.. Now that I have my Roku system and can tap into Netflix and Amazon.com on-demand movies, I am no longer held hostage by Comcast's low budget investments in old movies no body wants to see, but can tap into a much better selection.. It installs pretty easy and works great. The user interface is a no-brainer. I love it and for $99, well worth the investment. Cool device... especially for people that already have Netflix, you may as well pick it up.. 

$$;
Pros:. It connected to my TV with a HDMI cable and the video quality is excellent. The activation with Netflex was quick and simple. I purchased a Cisco Linksys WRT610N router with both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Dual-Band to stream the video.. I am good-to-go.. 
Cons:. The instructions are too simple for the electronics layperson who might not know that one has to press the TV / Video key to locate the COMP, VIDEO or HDMI screen to stream video. Composite cables should be replaced with at least Component cables.. 
Summary:. The Roku box is a great performer. However, it must be matched with the right strength router connected by the higher quality cables.. 

$$;
Pros:. Better than free VOD from my cable company (including Premium channel VOD). 
Cons:. Software update, activation a little clunky.. 
Summary:. Works HD-XR version works perfectly with my D-Link DIR-655. From 2nd floor to 1st, through a couple of walls, D-Link reports 81 Mbps, 66% signal.. I was blown away, I expected some pixelation and stutter, there was absolutely none.. Just got it last night, it was a little clunky downloading the software updates, entering 2 activation codes (Roku and Netflix) but after 10 minutes getting it set up, it blew away my expectations. Perfect 720p display throughout the entire movie, about as good as any cable display.. 

$$;
Pros:. Built-in Wi-Fi. Easy set-up. Great image and sound quality. Unbelievable price for all it offers. Growing selection from Netlflix and Amazon, plus more channels coming soon.. 
Cons:. Rekindles your love for your television and home entertainment system, to the detriment of playing outside. Causes pangs of regret about all the money you've spent for ho-hum cable TV.. 
Summary:. I've owned my Roku player for over a year now; I bought it shortly after it launched, and have not had a single problem with it in that time. Stellar product. Elementary set-up. Dependable and consistent. Does exactly what it says it will, and for $100, is infinitely more valuable than dozens of other tech product I have purchased for far more money.. I now see Roku has recently launched an even more affordable (!!) $79 standard-definition version, as well as a high-end version that has built-in Wi-Fi n (the lower-cost players come with standard b/g Wi-Fi built in, which is completely adequate in my case).. I love it, my wife loves it, and my 4.5-year-old loves it. If you like movies, don't like Blockbuster, and enjoy cutting-edge, simple-as-a-hammer tech products that work, the Roku cannot be beat. Anyone who says otherwise also complains about how much difficulty they have checking their voicemail.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up. Brilliant picture with use of HDMI. Small. Offers a VAST variety!. 
Cons:. Non really. Just check your router security for Wi-Fi use. Sometimes WAP format is better than WPA security format.. 
Summary:. $99 goes a LONG WAY:). 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to get connected to your internet connection.  Works amazingly well over a wireless network, but recommend connecting to wired like I did.  So many features to be had like movies in HD now and soon to come digital audio out.. 
Cons:. If you have a firewall or router, you may have to open the proper ports to make it work right through wireless.. 
Summary:. Great little device.  It is so rare that you buy a piece of equipment that has the ability to upgrade without buying an extra piece or replace it.  Amazing that Roku had the foresight to include ports that didn't even work just because they knew they would work at some point.  The software and firmware upgrades happen automatically.  The quality is the same as DVD quality in my opinion on most movies, especially the HD movies.  I highly recommend connecting using HDMI, but the quality is decent either way.. 

$$;
Pros:. LOVE this product! I have had one since they came out and have never had any problems. I was able to convince my husband to cancel our cable after he saw everything that was available through the Roku and Netflix. Set up and use could not be easier!. 
Cons:. Nothing, everything is great!. 
Summary:. I will be giving these as gifts this year to family and friends. Everyone who sees ours wants one!. Updated. on Sep 22, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. The first thing that I do coming home after a tiring work day is spend some time watching one of my favorite TV show on my Roku. There so much great selection of TV episodes and movies to pick from Netflix and Amazon Video On Demand.. 
Cons:. Nothing at all, maybe more content partners, which I?m sure is coming down the pipeline.. 
Summary:. The Roku player is one of the best devices that I have purchased this year. It is really an affordable buy at only $100. And you get so much from the little set top box. That?s amazing. Apart from Netflix and Amazon Video On Demand, with the new partner MLB.com added to Roku?s list, you get even more options. If you are a die-hard baseball fan like me, then you should not miss this.. When it comes to picture quality, Roku is great. One thing I would like to clearly emphasize is that if your broadband connection speed is faster (my is around 2.0 Mbps) then you will certainly see highest quality. Remember, the quality of streaming depends on how fast your broadband speed and you need at least 1.3 Mbps to enjoy the Roku player.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. The Roku is easy to set-up and use.. 2. My hard-wired Internet connection (3-7 Mbps DSL) provides an excellent picture on my 32" HD TV, and the sound is just fine through my stereo system. I haven't tried a wireless connection.. 
Cons:. It needs an on-off switch.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent free content!!. 
Cons:. None........ 
Summary:. My family and I watch all the time! Love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Cable modem 720p streaming beats 480 cracked or skipping DVDs. Easy pause on remote. 
Cons:. Should have a USB connection allowing storage drive steaming.. 

$$;
Pros:. Setup and connection to network was very easy. Love that it offers multiple ways to connect to TV (composite, hdmi, s-video, component, etc.). Built in wireless or use network cable.. 
Cons:. Limited content providers.. 
Summary:. Most complaints that I've read are really issues with the content provider or Internet speed. I bought this box soley for Netflix and love the fact that Roku will be adding more content provides. No, it doesn't do 1080p, so it won't blow Blu-Ray away, but it's great at what it does. Wonder if the box is worth $99? Take a look at eBay. Folks are pretty close to retail for used versions of it. Apparently the market thinks it's worth the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. BUY ONE 2 EXPERIENCE IT YUR SELF.TOO MUCH 2 VIEW,WHEN YOU WANT,AS MUCH AS YOU WANT FOR SAME MONTHLY FEE.. 
Cons:. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE ??....IN 30 DAYS YOUR NOT SATISFIED RETURN FOR A REFUND.. 
Summary:. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD ROUTER &#38; HIGH SPEED CABLE.FOR BEST PICTURE. 

$$;
Pros:. price and quality. 
Cons:. I can't think of anything not mentioned.. 
Summary:. I get 4-star downloads consistently so I'm its ideal user. No downside.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small. Easy to set up. Updated software itself. Logged into netflix with no problem after confirming ID over computer. Streaming video was amazingly good even when using Roku player's built in Wi-Fi.. 
Cons:. Only con is that I did not get it sooner. Not all things stream from Netflix at this time, but works as a perfect supplement to find hidden treasures. You need your own HDMI cable, but that is not unexpected.. 
Summary:. Small. Easy to set up. Updated software itself. Logged into netflix with no problem after confirming ID over computer. Streaming video was amazingly good even when using Roku player's built in Wi-Fi. Easy sign-in to my Wi-Fi network password.. HDMI hook up worked perfectly out of box.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1) SIMPLE, SIMPLE, SIMPLE. 2) Movies without pay-per-view (or PPV on Amazon if you want). 3) Very good video quality on most flicks. 
Cons:. Would like the audio to be 5.1 or higher but will settle for stereo in the hopes of firmware updates.. 
Summary:. I've had none of the technical issues that others have described. Video quality is good to very good on my 37" 720p LCD. I even have the video connected through RGB component due to lack of HDMI inputs (HDMI switch will soon fix that). You can not go wrong for $99 upfront and $9/month in Netflix subscription. My wife most often thinks I'm silly for my home theatre infatuations but even she had to admit this was one of the coolest things she's ever seen.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple setup, easy to use, looks very good on standard def 27", kids shows and movies without the commercials, no additional charge to watch Netflix instant queue on your TV, remembers where you left off, pause, rewind. 
Cons:. Limited selection, but I would expect this to grow over time. 
Summary:. I have only had Roku for 1 month and it is great so far. While selection is limited, we have way more on instant queue than we can possibly get to in a year and I would expect that instant selection will grow over time. When watching Roku, you can pause, rewind, and fast forward. If you want part of a selection, it remembers where you left off and you can start from there, or start over. For multi-episode selections, you can also choose to skip to a different episode. And after you watch, you can remove the program from your instant queue, or leave it on the queue.. It is very easy to setup, especially if you already have Netflix account and already tried streaming to your computer. I have not tried Amazon, so I cannot speak for Amazon setup. Our Roku is connected wireless to broadband (3MB) internet via old G-router. It is about 50 feet away from router and we always get strong signal, 4 dots (but this is rural area, so no interference of any kind apart from cordless phone and CFLs). Simply plug it in, setup for wireless (or wired if close to router), and Roku provides Netflix access code. Go to your computer and log into Netflix account and enter the code and within minutes your instant queue shows up on Roku. Very cool.. Hooked up to standard def 27" and picture looks very good. I am not interested in spending big bucks to get best quality video &#38; audio. It works great for TV. I will defer to others to comment on home theater and large screen suitability.. This is great for setting up kids programs so kids can watch TV/movies without commercials and without messing with discs and tapes (yes, we still have tapes).. My only complaint is with Netflix. Netflix allows me to have multiple queues for discs, but not multiple queues for instant. I would like an instant queue for kids and a separate instant queue for us, with ability to choose with optional password from Roku.. If you are used to cable/satellite on standard def TV, this is a great option for watching movies / shows on-demand. If you already have Netflix account, this is one time charge for Roku box and no additional charges. I highly recommend Roku!. 

$$;
Pros:. robust wireless support, easy setup, netflix and amazon support and content, excellent video quality (SD and HD). 
Cons:. no access to movies on my own PC (mediacenter support or similar would be great). 
Summary:. pro:. great flexibility in setup (wired, and very easy and solid wireless interface), simply interface to get setup done. navigation is easy and straightforward.. it is great to have access to as many Netflix titles for free (provided you have a subscription), and in my opinion picture quality is great. the HD titles are of course downright stunning in quality. make no mistake - this will kill DVDs faster than you think, this is the future of delivery.. support for Amazon titles is also rock solid, and very up to date choices (if you are willing to pay per title).. oh, and all this for only $99? this box is fantastic.. con:. hard to find faults with this little box that does so much for such a low cost.. in a perfect world, of course, i'd like to see the roku offer support for windows media center or a similar setup that gives me access to video titles i have on my computer. i mean high quality video titles, ripped DVDs etc - personally i am not interested in watching youtube on my TV set, but ymmv. another thing has less to do with the Roku box and more with the way netflix works for on demand titles - it's hard to stay atop the new titles, netflix could and should improve navigation of their available titles.. summary:. this is the future of on-demand tv watching.. i was about to buy a blueray player, but upon buying this box decided there is no need for me to do that anymore. any new title is cheaper and more convenient to own on amazon, really, and the richness of classic content of netflix very neatly documents that.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to setup. Easy to use. Lots of connection options.. 
Cons:. Not much in the way of diagnostics for techno-geeks.. 
Summary:. I bought this to pair up with my Netflix account. Setup was a breeze and overall operation is simple enough that anybody could figure it out. I was impressed by the number of connection options they managed to fit into that little box including HDMI and WiFi. I've used it on a 40" LCD and an older 32" CRT and the picture quality on both is on par with a standard DVD player... our streams are delivered via Comcast. Some limitations, which are a function of Netflix and not Roku, are fast-forwarding, rewinding and chapter skipping... none of which work quite the way I would like. I've queued up over 100 movies on my Netflix account and they all appear on the Roku box so I'm not sure what the queue limitation is. I have not hooked this up to my surround-sound receiver so I can't comment on that.. The only problem I've had is that one time I had trouble getting a stream to start. For some reason the buffering progress bar would stop progressing and then the unit would go back to the movie title screen. This may not be a problem with the Roku box and could be a Comcast or Netflix issue, but either way, this is where it would be nice to have a techo-geek menu selection where I could do some diagnostics and troubleshooting. That's my only complaint.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely simple to use. Simple remote. Connects wirelessly from anywhere in the home. Many different connection outputs to connect to an older television or new HD flat panel. Setup took less than 10 minutes.. 
Cons:. No power off button? Simple unit design.. 
Summary:. Honestly, I can't figure out anything bad to say. Usually I want to focus on the things that could be improved about a product but it truly is a wonderful product. Okay maybe they could focus on making the unit blend better with my existing audio/video equipment.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, reasonably priced, streaming video across wi-fi is flawless, and even my wife loves it.. 
Cons:. limited movie selection on netflix. 
Summary:. this is the best product i have used in 5 years - it works flawlessly, was easy to configure, and very reasonably priced.. 

$$;
Pros:. With Roku you can just plug and play and that is it. Roku has great quality and good offerings with Netflix and Amazon, all at a fraction of the cost of going with all the cable or satellite listings and offerings, and at a fraction of the effort... 
Cons:. None - you just have to know that this isn't going to give you HBO - but either as an addition or a replacement to cable or satellite, it is first rate.. 
Summary:. I have got to the point of just saying to hell with all the new gadgets and offerings. Even with cable you have to be a geek to program a remote... if you have a few devices you need to get a universal and program that. With Roku you can just plug and play and that is it... I am done with having to be a geek and doing the work for a cable provider - if they can't make it real simple, than I don't have the time to waste. Lots of other more important things to do than in figuring out and resolving their issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Very easy setup and Excellent quality.Mor than happy. 
Cons:. None! was very easy to set up and is Very easy to use and excellent quality. 
Summary:. It was Very Very easy to set up just like someone was holding my hand. Also the Audio/Picture is Great even over just my DSL. And there are so many choices to choose from it is amazing. I would highly suggest it for anyone.Was one of the best investments I made in a long time. 

$$;
Pros:. We got rid of cable and satellite tv over a decade ago and have been using our television for viewing videos only. With access to Netflix and Amazon Video on Demand, we have a great selection from which to choose.. 
Cons:. We do not have any complaints about the player.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to set up. My 13yr old did it in less than 5 min. easy to use. Interface is flawless. tons of content, now with Amazon Video on demand even more!. 
Cons:. no surround sound. 
Summary:. This is the best $99.00 I have spent on technology. They have provided several updates since I purchased mine...HD, Amazon Video On Demand and more. I cant ever remember buying a product like this and getting more than I paid for again and again...Good for roku...This box ROCKS. 

$$;
Pros:. Free movies, TV shows, Set-up is a breeze! User-friendly!!! Love being able to watch every episode of the Munsters with my 6 yr. old daughter.. 
Cons:. Remote is less than advanced. Search features lacking and navigation could be better.. 
Summary:. Worth every penny! Just awesome!!! Can't wait for Amazon on Demand!. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid build quality. Great usability on many levels. Paragon of simplicity. Very good picture quality. They did everything right, as Apple is known for.. 
Cons:. Entering long and secure WPA passwords is very tedious.. 
Summary:. The user interface is great. The remote feels great in the hand, works in any orientation, and always sends the intended number of clicks. Roku one-uped Apple at building a high quality device that you like more the longer you use it, rather than disappointing the more you use it. And at $100 it is a steal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, easy to set up and works....what more is there?. 
Cons:. If any it would have to be the little light in front (power on). 
Summary:. I had read reviews of how many problems they had but...Out of the box I knew I would like this...small and everything was there. simple to hook up and (important) if you have read their instructions about which router works and you use that, you will NOT have any problems...period. Got everything hooked up and the moment of truth...power on! WOW ! it found my router, asked me for the code and we were off to the races. It configured and then asked me to activate my Netflix account and gave me a code. I went to the Netflix website, clicked Activate, input the code and by the time I walked back into the livingroom, it was up and had my que up and on the screen.. Don't buy anything else.......... This is the perfect thing, it even upgraded the firmware automatically right then !!. My wife is jealous, I told her that I have fallen in love again.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the price ($99) and the instant gratification of watching the new Starz movies on Netflix. The interface is so simple and easy to use. The set up took less than five minutes to plug it in and hook it up to my wireless internet connection.. 
Cons:. It's hard to find anything wrong with this little box, it does what it's suppose to do and you can't beat the price ($99).. 
Summary:. This has got to be one of the COOLEST PRODUCTS EVER! I love it and so do all my friends who come round to watch movies on my Roku player. I can't wait to start watching all the new releases from Amazon video on demand that is coming soon to the roku player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up. Easy to use. Small footprint. Did I mention easy to set up?. 
Cons:. None. Content is a little limited for streaming, but Netflix still sends me as many DVD's as I can exchange a month.. 
Summary:. See my review at hoosiertoo.blogspot.com. 

$$;
Pros:. This was worth every penny, we have done away with cable and replaced it with this box and we don't miss cable much at all.... 
Cons:. there have been a few movies that did not get encoded correctly, but a quick call to Netflix gets them on the fix list and they get repaired.. 
Summary:. I have been completely satisfied with this purchase, and now I am just ecstatic that they are going to be adding more &#38; more content and channels best $100 I ever spent!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. sound and video is excellent, interface is very easy to use and set up. This is the convenience of the internet combined with the best of Hollywood.. 
Cons:. no HD, not all movies and TV shows are available for instant play. 
Summary:. an excellent value and a wonderful product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use the quality is amazing.... 
Cons:. Need more newer movies to pick from.... "But for the price it's well worth it". 

$$;
Pros:. - Surprisingly good selection. - Surprisingly good video quality on a 55" Sony LCD. - Very clean design and GUI. - Easy setup. - Dirt cheap compared to any other movie source. - It does what they say it does. 
Cons:. - Some glitches watching certain films, although most stream flawlessly. - Sometimes you only get 2 dots out of 4 (streaming issues that Neflix claims are fixed). - You may not get much sleep if you buy one (too much good stuff to just "go to bed"). 
Summary:. Roku was a whim purchase for me. CNET reviewed it, and I already had a Netflix account, so why not. I was blown away with how good this little box is. I've watched hundreds of movies in the last two months.. Sometimes I don't make it through the whole movie, but that's the point. In the first five minutes if I find out I'm watching a bad "B" movie that has no redeeming value (some are fun to watch because they're bad), I pick something else. No harm - no foul, I just move on to another movie. I gave up on renting movies due to how many bad movies I went home with. Roku eliminates that and even better, Roku allows you to take chances on movies that you suspect you won't like and certainly wouldn't rent. Sometimes I've been surprised by movies I didn't think I would like.. There are thousands of movies I never saw because I didn't see them in the theater, or rent them. Roku has allowed me to catch up on what I may or may not have missed. It's outstanding for students studying film since so many classics are available.. The final reason I love Roku. Foreign movies. I'm a huge foreign movie fan and Roku has allowed me to watch some extremely moving films. Films that take chances and stay with you. I would have never seen any of these films without Netflix and Roku. I give Roku the credit because I probably wouldn't have rented them through Netflix itself. Like I said, Roku enables you to take chances on films you wouldn't see otherwise.. There have been some streaming issues, but Netflix claims to have fixed them. I don't know about that, but with what I've watched already I have zero regrets, and I use it every day.. Updated. on Dec 10, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. I was able to set it up on my home network in a few minutes. Was watching movies right away. I was afraid that picture quality would not be acceptable on my 42 inch HDTV. But it was. Quality is different for different movies, but all were watchable.. 
Cons:. Pause and rewind work but it takes getting used to if you are used to having the whole show recorded on the hard drive. I would like the product to do some caching so I can go back and forward quickly for say 10 minutes.. 
Summary:. Excellent product. Well made. Very good value for the money. Picture quality is good but I would like it to be even better. Better selection of movies would also be good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super Easy Setup. Simple U.I. that gives you everything you need. Good looking device. Quality of video exceeded my expectations.. 
Cons:. None yet........ 
Summary:. You ever use a product or a service and you just know that it was built or executed the right way? This is one of those products. The setup is super easy..it just works! The User interface is very simple..yet it gives you everything you need. Wireless works well, and of course, it's even faster with a wired connection. Great value for $99.99.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Nothing, All good. 
Summary:. I dont know about the reviewers on cnet but i have this thing streaming wirelessly and it works great!! Never had a skip and the quality is comparable to dvd. I have a 50" samsung dlp and it looks great. Movies load in less then 10 seconds. I would recomend this to anybody with a good internet connection.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up, easy to use, exceptionally affordable.. 
Cons:. I have had my product now for two weeks, and have not experienced one negative todate.. 
Summary:. This product does not measure up to the advertising, but rather exceeds them. It is comes amazingly packaged, super easy to install, and comes complete with easy to understand and impliment directions.. While some people seem to have complained about the limited number of movies to watch, Netflix continues to make improvements on product offerings, but most of all has a serious grip of their customers needs and wants. This little box is the just the beginning of new technology that will change the way we watch movies today, and into the future.. 

$$;
Pros:. affordable, simple user interface. 
Cons:. none at all. 
Summary:. The Netflix Player is the greatest gadget since the PVR (TiVo) came out. Netflix offers a decent library of titles and the user interface is very intuitive. Right now it is my favorite gadget.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy, convenient, great to have. 
Cons:. Current available video/audio quality is mediocre. 
Summary:. I love this box and for $99 its a steal. Much better than the DVD mailer route for:. 1. FREE grandkids shows that are needed on the spur of the moment,. 2. FREE short indy videos that I'd never queue up otherwise,. 3. FREE for surfing music DVDs just to check them out (I'm suddenly a Yanni fan),. 4. FREE for TV shows (Heroes) that was already on my regular queue,. 5. FREE, yes for older stuff that I just use as filler when my DVDs haven't arrived.. 6. FREE instant selection from 10K offerings.. NOTE: The box is capable of much better audio/video, all the way up to HDMI and digital HD video and 5.1 audio as soon as the bandwidth and source offerings are available. And for right now, $99 up front and FREE re-curring cost is out-of-the-ballpark unique, like, not offered by anyone else. Until the available source material improves I don't see how anyone can rate the box itself at anything under a "10".. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to Use, Great Price. 
Cons:. None So Far. 
Summary:. We have ours hooked up to a standard def Sony and it absolutely ROCKS! We are by no means early adopters of tech hardware, but this is a no-brainer. Anyone giving the Roku low marks has obviously NOT used one. It is simple to operate, the quality is the same as our digital cable, and though selection is limited, we have no problems finding titles to watch.. No question this is the wave of the future. Apple TV and Vudu are flops compared to the Roku. All-you-can-eat titles, great quality, all at NO extra charge. Expect the number of titles to grow tremendously in the next 6 to 12 months as these boxes catch on.. The whole family just loves the Roku. We are ordering a second one for the HD set in our bedroom. I give the Roku a perfect 10 as I don't find "only" 10,000 titles to be a drawback.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use. Plug it in, pair it and you see your instant viewing queue. It easily found my home network. It's also small. The image resolution is excellent over our slowish cable internet connection.. 
Cons:. It's another tiny remote to keep track of. It's unclear which channels are for pay and which are for free.. 
Summary:. Love it. It's the easiest way for us to get Netflix on the the t.v.. 

$$;
Pros:. Does everything you want it to do.. Extremely light and portable.. Hook up to any TV in 60 seconds.. You can bring it to a friend's house and get a new activation code.. 
Cons:. Limited by NETFLIX online selection.. No Off switch.. 
Summary:. If you already have many dvd players in your house and don't want to pay the extra money for a Netflix/DVD player combo than the ROKU player is the best option. I purchased the standard ROKU player, not the HD, because my TV is not HD. The picture is digital quality and perfect for me. It was $79 with free shipping.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to setup and use.. Better than Comcast's basic ONDEMAND. 
Cons:. Rewinding and Fast Forwarding does not work effectively.. Netflix selection is limited.. 
Summary:. I think this is well worth the $100 one time price if you are going to subscribe to Netflix anyway. Although Netlix has a limited and not great selection of movies, there is usually something I want to watch. The selection of TV shows is a little better, and if you check online frequently there are new releases and more popular movies available for shorter amounts of time. I think the seletion is better than the instant selection my cable offers and the box wroks well.. I'm looking forward to trying MLB.com next year! All the playoff games this year were offered for only $10!. 

$$;
Pros:. It is easy to use and can be wired or wireless. The addition of MLB shows they are making progress adding more options for the consumer.. 
Cons:. You do need a strong internet connection.. 
Summary:. A great to watch movies or television at your own pace and a great price.. 

$$;
Pros:. It took about 1 hour from when I opened the box to when I was watching Star Trek season 1 and the quality was as good as a DVD. Hopefully they will have internet radio such as Pandora, which make this even better.. 
Cons:. There is no off button. As of yet I have not figured out, other then unplugging the box, how to turn this thing off. Minor overall. Also Netflix and Amazon of demand the only options for now, but I am sure there will be more soon.. 
Summary:. I highly recommend this to anyone with a decent internet connection and subscription to netflix. Tons of free content to watch. It is very small and unobtrusive. Easy connection. It is better with an HDMI connection.. 

$$;
Pros:. The device works great. I can watch movies on my old TV upstairs via the wireless link as well as on my HDTVwith wired ethernet by moving the device to the respective TV.. 
Cons:. They play games with the shipping. I sat at one computer and saw $14.99 for shipping. Cleared the cache and the shipping went to $0.00. Using my Firefox browser it showed $9.99. My son's PC showed $4.99. Customer service would not adjust.. 
Summary:. Buy the product, play with the browser to alter shipping before ordering.. 

$$;
Pros:. I was online within minutes and browsing my Netflix queue, and playing my first program within about ten minutes. Everything is simple, intuitive, and fast. The video quality varies from item to item, but is good overall.. 
Cons:. There's no surround sound (stereo only), and you are limited to Netflix and Amazon. It would be great if Hulu (or similar) services were available through it.. 
Summary:. For $99 you just can't go wrong. The box updates itself to add new features, and is HD compliant for whenever Netflix starts streaming HD content. The lack of surround sound is disappointing, but acceptable. This small device has greatly increased the value of my Netflix subscription.. 

$$;
Pros:. picture quality is great, i'm receiving my signal via 720p and its almost crystal clear, the picture is better than the digital signal i get watching tv, (DTV). The guide for the movies in que is cool, easy to hook up, (less than five minutes).. 
Cons:. the fast forward and rewind feature could be a little faster.. 
Summary:. they could charge more for this product, i paid 99. and got more than my money's worth, i wasnt expecting it to be this great. I was prepare to settle for good or ok, but this is awesome, being able to have something to watch when nothing is on tv, or instantly find a movie to suit my mood is awesome. I wished i had tried this sooner if your not sure if this is for you, let me tell you HD movies when you want, oh and i do have 5.1 sound thru my RCA receiver, theres nothing better. By the way i cancelled my movie package with DTV, because it's cheaper with Netflix and picture quality is better. Best 99. i've ever spent. Get it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Overall easy to set-up and account linking. Now that it streams Amazon it's usefulness has doubled. I am using it on a 1.5 Mbps WiFi connection and a 60in SDTV and get an amazing picture. Your queue is updated instantaneously, no waiting or forcing.. 
Cons:. For the computer novice the set-up might be tricky as it is not 100% compatible with every router. On my cheapo Belkin router I had to turn off my firewall entirely for it to complete the connection.. 
Summary:. Other than it's quirky relationship with many routers out there, this box has been a god-send. While I have not had pay-TV for a year and a half. I got rid of it after I started playing WoW. Well I recently gave up on WoW and was looking at my entertainment alternatives. I already had Netflix and frequently streamed movies so this was a no brainer for me. I can't speak for it's HD performance, but for you SD hold-outs, its SD performance is excellent. I use it on a 60in old-school bigscreen and it looks perfect on my 1.5 Mbps WiFi connection. The only time I have seen artifacts was when watching Ratatouille when there was a very fast movement in a frame (comicly fast head turn and things of that sort), but it didn't take away from the experience. This is only due to my connection speed though. This device is easily the best investment I have ever made.. 

$$;
Pros:. selection is not complete in almost any area, but there is something for everyone in the instant listings. simple small footprint box, many many output options. svideo cable to my old rear projection tv looks nearly as good as dvd.. 
Cons:. remote is too small and easy to lose in my couch. scrolling through queue with over 200 titles in it can be a little slow. some options for alphabetizing it or perhaps having more than 1 row of titles on screen might help.. 
Summary:. overall the device uses approximately 3.5mbps to give me a very acceptable way of watching hundreds of netflix titles every month without ever having to wait for the mailman. with the disc by mail system i tend not to take chances because a dud movie might mean doing without until a new one arrives. not anymore. i can add any old thing to the queue no matter how odd and if i don't like it it only takes a few seconds to dump it from the list. you doubt my? I watched a movie called Doggy Poo a few weeks ago about a small lump of freshly dumped dog poo that is searching for meaning in its life. would you wait 2 days for the mailman to bring you this?. I would love to have more than one of these boxes, but with my bandwidth limited to 5mbps the quality would suffer. (I tried watching one on pc while one played on Roku box and quality was unnaceptable.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD quality for some movies, DVD quality for everything else. Easy set up and firmware upgrading. Great deal when combined with Netflix 2 or 3 DVDs at a time by mail. Finally found a replacement for Comcast Cable.. 
Cons:. Unable to browse Netflix library from the TV - have to add movies to your list from a PC. Noticed some lag issues (would exit movie and go to movie loading screen) over wireless network, but this has been resolved with a new Trendnet router.. 
Summary:. I was a bit skeptical about buying this mainly since I was concerned that the picture quality over our wireless network would be terrible. We had a few minor issues initially, but our router was 5 years old, so we just bought a new one. The selection of movies available to use with this box is pretty good, and is constantly expanding. It's incredibly easy to set up and use. It's great to be able to take as long as you like to watch a movie, and the spot you are at is held in the memory for all movies in your list. Movies aren't automatically deleted when you watch them - this is a good thing since wecan keep all my daughter's favourite TV shows in the queue permanently. We are having a lot of trouble watching everything we have in our queue - so much to choose from! It was great to ditch our $70 a month Comcast Cable, and pay $100 for the box then $17 for unlimited streaming and 3 DVDs at a time (best way to get newer movies). The picture quality has generally been DVD quality. When it has been lower quality, I just exit the movie and reload it, which usually fixes it. There are only a few movies available in HD, but you don't pay extra for them. Only minor gripe is the inability to select movies directly from the TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ordered in Jan 09 before Amazon on Demand is supposed to be available. The Netflix quality is very good. I upgraded to version 1.5 which supports 720p and was very impressed. Even at 480 it was pretty good on my HDTV.. 
Cons:. Other reviews have complained about video quality. I noticed a slight pixelation when watching Spiderman 3. Depends a lot on your Internet connection. It's streaming video so some flaws are to be expected.. 
Summary:. Worth the $100. I hope Netflix puts all of their movies on their Instant Queue!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Brainless set-up, seamless integration with the Netflix website, clean look to set-top box, small footprint, simple yet efficient remote, wireless (thank you), crisp resolution. 
Cons:. So far none to speak of. . .. 
Summary:. Purchased for the Christmas as a gift to in-house family member (that way I could benefit too, LOL!) In regard to setup, it took me longer to undo the twist ties from the RCA cables and the power adapter then it did for me to set-up the ROKU Box and start watching a movie from the Instant Queue.. I used RCA due to use on tube TV, though I will move the box to test the HDMI port out on 50" HDTV (just to see. . .will follow up). The picture quality was better than I could have ever hoped, especially due to the fact that I'm on Wi-Fi (G) network. The box detected my network and connected no problem. I did have to enable DCHP on my router, wasn't able to assign the ROKU a static IP address, though I didn't look too hard, will investigate that one a bit further, but either way doesn't really matter.. The box produced the activation code in quick order and I entered that code into the Netflix account, all without issue. Then popped into Instant Queue to add a couple of movies to test. As soon as movies were added to queue, they were available on the ROKU.. I'm not worried about the movie selection, there's more than enough to be entertained with now, plus the fact that I'm not paying anything extra to have this service outside of the one-time equipment cost....hello....I call that a deal. As another reviewer wrote "THE FUTURE IS HERE". I wholeheartedly believe that...this is where all movies are heading, and I bet we'll all be surprised in just how fast the "transition" really happens.. If you're on the fence with this product...all I can say to you is I have bought a total of three of these devices, one to keep in the house and the other two to gift away. After this Christmas, I'm now the one relative known for giving the "good" gifts.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use and simple set up, make tis very small set top box fitting nicely into your home theatre arena. The controls help you click the movie and see the descripton. There is no lag time since the movie downloads quick PRIOR to watching.. 
Cons:. Would be nice to be able to use all Netflix features right on the box since it is pretty generic and basic looking, but I bet that will come soon. The quality of some movies a bit grainy, but not awfull.. 
Summary:. I went out on a limb and bought this and with my 9.00 Netflix subscription and still able to get my new releases on DVD mailed along with the on demand feature, it makes this well worth it.. Updated. on Oct 13, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy Setup, Good Quality Picture, Tiny.. 
Cons:. One source for content right now, must use computer to add content to cue.. 
Summary:. I live in a rural area where broadcast TV reception is not so good and I'm too cheap to spend money on cable or a satellite dish. I only use TV for movie watching anyway and I have a Netflix account because the local video store selection is lousy. I bought this box to give me convenient access to more content.. Setup was a snap and it only took a few minutes for the Roku to find and connect to my secure wireless G network. I had to enter the WPA key using the remote.. I had placed several movies and TV shows into my instant cue earlier that day and after I connected that content was then viewable on my TV screen. The selection interface does a great job and it's easy to flip through and find what you want to watch.. Picture quality is better than I expected. It's not HD quality but it looks pretty good. I'd say it's in between VHS and DVD and closer in quality to the DVD so not bad. The level of quality automatically varies depending on your connection speed. There are 4 levels and mine uses either level 2 or level 3. The box is highly adaptable and selects it's level based on many factors and the auto quality level selection can be disabled and set to one level if desired.. Playing a movie doesn't happen instantaneously but it takes about 20 seconds in my case for buffering before the show starts. I have not had it pause to buffer once playback has begun yet so it works well.. The box has many connection options including component video, stereo sound, optical audio, HDMI and S video. There is no RF modulator and you'll need one if your TV does not support one of these options. I use the HDMI and the 16:9 aspect ratio.. In the future HD movies and 5.1 sound will be offered because the technology is there in the box and it just needs a firmware upgrade to make that happen.. In the future I would like to see access to non Netflix content on Hulu and other sites, You Tube etc as well as a way to stream music and video from a NAS or PC. As it stands all of this is possible with the right firmware and that firmware is Linux based and thus open sourced which should allow for some neat stuff in the future.. All in all a very cool product that brings a lot to your home for only $100 and an inexpensive Netflix membership speaking of which you can support up to four boxes all sharing the same cue on one membership. Cool. 

$$;
Pros:. 5 min. setup, works immed., plenty of content already. 
Cons:. Must use netflix site to hunt movies, no big deal. 
Summary:. Can't wait for:. HD. Other movie/tv sources. Access netflix thru roku. 5.1 sound. free software updates(no bugs noticed). 

$$;
Pros:. great quality, innovative product, good image quality, easy install. 
Cons:. user interface , titles availability. 
Summary:. this is s great product for movie lovers. very responsive, user friendly and reliable. you won't be disappointed by this innovative product ! give netflix time for some firmware updates and roku will be perfect!!. 

$$;
Pros:. - none so far. 
Cons:. - super easy set up / great image. 
Summary:. I received the device 3 days ago and it is the best gizmo ever. I set it up in 15 minutes and started watching the movies in my queue.. It downloads really fast(broadband connection) and the image is the same as DVD quality.. I have a DPG-1200 Medialounge from D-Link that ended up being my worst nightmare - horrible product, impossible to set up and full of glitches - I called support and they did not even know about the product. After 1 hr on the phone I was told that just ONE employee knew the product enough to troubleshoot it and he had left for the day. The ended up exchanging it for me but that unit still does not work. AND they refused a reimbursement. Stay away from them!!!. If you want to stream movies to your TV without going nuts get ROKU!!! Fantastic!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent quality, easy set up. 
Cons:. Limited selection of older titles, no 'n' speed WiFi. 
Summary:. I have used the player for a week and I am very pleased. The set up was easy and it works well with my Apple Time Capsule WiFi although I had to reconfigure my network to accept g-speed devices which has the effect of slowing down my other connections that are all n-speed. I used the s-video connection and it's as good as DVD on my Sony Wega TV. I only wish that Netflix had more recent titles, but for the money it's good value.. 

$$;
Pros:. Low price, speed of delivery. 
Cons:. Somewhat limited selection, all foreign films dubbed. 
Summary:. For the one-time $100 price tag, this is an absolutely fantastic deal, but buyers should be realistic about what they are getting. First of all, Netflix would obviously not offer new, popular releases for free on this service. Most likely, they took the films that were not getting rented very often, converted them into digital files and freed up warehouse space in exchange for server space. So your selection is not going to be the best and the most popular films. If you look deep enough though, you'll find hundreds and hundreds of great movies to fill the Instant Queue. The delivery is very quick as well. I hooked up mine wirelessly and still have yet to wait more than 1 minute for a highest quality (480p) resoluton film. My only gripe so far is the relatively limited selection of foreign films, and the fact that all the ones available are dubbed (including anime). If in the future there could be an audio and subtitle option that would be ideal. I look forward to seeing where the Roku leads. There is an HDMI output on the back, leading me to believe HD quality delivery is not far away. In the near future, there will also most likely be a service that allows you download the best new releases, but for a nominal fee. This is the future folks, be an early adopter!. 

$$;
Pros:. Instant watching on your own TV. 
Cons:. Only one Roku box/TV can be viewed at a time. 
Summary:. After 2 weeks, what shines through is the ease of use, the TOTAL lack of glitches, the availability of 10000 titles with more to come. On my Sony HDTV, the Netflix box gives a DVD quality picture and the sound is great. I use a HDMI connection from the box, directly to the TV. There are numerous concerts on the list which will confirm the great sound. It's apparent Roku worked out any bugs before releasing the box for purchase. The fact that $99 is the entire cost is great. knowing that other than my monthly fee, I'm done paying and can start watching is quite reassuring.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup, low cost, great selection of older movies and programs. 
Cons:. New movie selections needs work. 
Summary:. I received and installed the Roku Netflix Player a few days ago. My setup is a 50" Panasonic plasma, Roku player connected via HDMI, Belkin Pre-N wireless router, and Comcast broadband connection. I'll try to present here the pros and cons that I have experienced with this unit.. Pros:. 1. Relatively easy to install (make sure you have necessary info like SSID, your WEP and WAP security passcode for your wireless router) for wireless setup.. 2. Picture quality is quite good (nearly SD-DVD 480p if not better). Remember the veiwing quality is dependent on the original source. Some movies are very clear and some not as good. Again, it's the original copy not the Netflix transmission.. 3. Large selection of movies and programs. I am a fan of the classics, where the plot and story line were more important than special effects. I found Netflix provides a large selection of those classics like Alfred Hitchcock movies and even his TV series and others.. 4. After the initial setup there is no logging on or waiting for Netflix to do their thing to start. It's on twenty four/seven whenever you are in the mood to watch a movie in your instant queue.. 5. No extra cost to your original Netflix plan as long as you are enrolled to one of their unlimited instant view plans.. 6. Unit low power consumption in standby uses 4 watts and 5 watts during actual veiwing a movie.. 7. Remote is small with large enough selection buttons and feels solid and well built in your hand.. 8. It remembers where you left off for every uncompleted movie and allows for resume play.. 9. It has its own built in WiFi access point. No need to add external access.. Cons:. 1. Screen display setup is somewhat confusing. The player recognized my TV and connections and suggested viewing Full 4:3 version, and I wondered why. I discovered the reason during playback of the download movies: most of Netflix's selection, for now, are 4:3 origination source and are spread more evenly across a widescreen TV using FULL. Anyway, my equipment allows for a very good widescreen FULL spread where you can barely notice objects are slightly wider.. 2. Rewind and forward option allows for frame by frame (in most cases) viewing, but when backing up or forwarding to where would like to be it needs to reload the movie to that spot. Not what we're use to with the traditional rewind and forward progression.. 3. There are a few movies not suited for children (topless women, adult situations and language) and there doesn't seem a way to password blocked those.. Conclusion:. Netflix has hit a homerun with this new feature. I told my wife, "This is the future of how movie selection and viewing will likely work (easy and fast)." If they keep their word to add the HD option, in the future, and provide software to allow PS3s and others to access your own Netflix account will broaden their user base. It may be the end of how satilite and cable do business; they are going to have to change by lowering their prices to compete with this new service.. BTW I do not work for Netflix, Roku, or any other of the companies mentioned above. I am only an impressed subscriber.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy, It works!. 
Cons:. limited by Netflix. 
Summary:. I have one, I love it.. Setup, from having the box in my lap to watching my first movie was twelve minutes! Wow.. I can't think of a thing I would change about this box. Only things I would change are all "coming soon" from Netflix. To clear up some of the things I've seen people say.. The box IS HD ready. It has Component and HDMI outs, as well as RCA and S-Video. Netflix does not yet deliver Watch it Now content in HD, but they say they are working on it.. The quantity of content is pretty good, but hardly as deep as their DVD library. At the end of the setup, it automatically went out to my queue and found 56 movies from my queue there were available for me to watch immediately.. Content, on my HDTV looks like the same quality as a DVD.. Netflix has said they are working on delivering HD content, as well as adding to their library as fast as they can.. 

$$;
Pros:. Perfect for watching those TV Series you missed.. 
Cons:. NONE, it does what it is supposed to do.. 
Summary:. I've had this now for two weeks. The picture quality is excellent. I have 6 meg DSL and have not had a bit of trouble with poor quality or a slow down.. If you can view instant movies at Netflix on your computer without slowdowns you will not have any trouble. If while watching on your computer and it takes more then a minute to start, stops or slows down it's going to be the same with the Roku player or even worse since there is no harddrive to cache the program to restart.. It's you internet provider not netflix or Roku.. So try viewing instant movies online at Netflix and if you have any slow start or stopping trouble do not buy.. Yes there are only 10,000 dvds to choose from, the reason is many studios have not released the rights to stream their product, not Netflix fault. Think about it. A brand new movie comes out on dvd and netflix buys what 25,000, 50,000 copies(?) for mailing out. Versus selling one copy to stream the movie. I'm sure there are $$$ issues being decided between Netflix and the studios.. So I pick the new movie dvds to be mailed out by netflix and watch the oddball movies and tV shows I missed. It's a nice addition to Netflix.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup &#38; great add on to a Netflix account.. 
Cons:. With the right expectations, there aren't any.. 
Summary:. Too many reviews bash the content available, but I disagree. Before you buy, look at what is available, and decide if that fits your style. There are plenty of TV series and older movies to view. To me it was an obvious add-on to my Netflix account, I already pay for a membership and for high speed internet, so $100 seemed like a samll price to pay to expand my Netflix account. If I want the latest movies and series, I'll get that in the mail in DVD format, if I want to watch and old classic, try out a TV series, or try something just for fun, I use the ROKU. I have it connected to my high def Sony, and the picture quality is DVD quality with my cable internet connection. You must have access to a speedy connection for the quality to be there, it self adjusts the picture quality based on your connection. Bottom line, it works, and with a little research I knew exactly what to expect, and it actually exceeded my expectations. If you are a Netflix customer, and want to expand your options, it is a good choice. Just understand the content is what it is, and is not a reflection of the device itself. Research first, and then decide.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy set up, simple operation, reasonable picture. 
Cons:. no cons (double meaning intended). 
Summary:. This thing operated exactly as advertised. Is the movie selection somewhat limited? Sure. That's not the player's fault. Besides, there are still lots of good movies and TV shows to pick from. Set up was very easy, operation is very easy, and it streams a very acceptable clear picture (I have a standard resolution TV, not HD), comparable to my satellite feed. I'm running a pretty basic ISP connection - DSL wireless with a 3 Mbyte download speed. My connection speed at the player is somewhere around 2.5-2.8 Mbyte. I have WEP encryption, no problem. So far I'm very happy. I didn't give it 10 out of 10 because I've only had it 1 day.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive and free movies. 
Cons:. No 5.1 and no HD. 
Summary:. Simple to install and quick. The box is what the internet and entertainment should be......and it's here now. Six to eight weeks backorder. I think this is great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up and Operation, no ongoing fees. 
Cons:. Selection, no 5.1 sound available yet. 
Summary:. I completely agree with the Editors' review. The box works fanstastic for my needs.. I had blockbuster.com but I realized about a year ago that very little of what we ordered were big Hollywood flicks.. Instead, we were ordering lots of foreign and independant films, TV shows and documentaries.. So the instant viewing feature fills much of our needs and the remaining movies we can receive by mail.. Our picture is near DVD with Comcast DSL connection. The router, however, is right by the TV. The box does not work at all if we move it upstairs even though we have a good router and get an ok signal on our upstairs computer.. We received the box two weeks and two days after ordering, last Saturday.. I advise anyone interested to first sign up for the free trial to see if you are interested in the movie selection. If so, this is a great deal!. 

$$;
Pros:. upgradeable, HDMI, optical audio, extreamly easy setup. 
Cons:. poor current selection of titles, current stream quality is not HD. 
Summary:. For the price of this unit it is very good. My wife loves just about any movie she can watch so old B-movies are ok for her. The kids love to watch anime and cartoons and I love my old TV shows from the 80's and 90's such as A-Team, Knight Rider, etc. While the current selection of movies is sub par they add new titles daily and Netflix is working on adding HD streams. The unit has built in WiFi and ethernet and HDMI and optical audio. It's so small that I set up cables on each of my TV's and I just move the box around my house depending on which TV I'm using. It takes about a minute to reconnect to the WiFi and load your playlist. This is an amazing product and I can't wait to see what future firmware updates hold for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. inexpensive,easy setup, HUGE potential future!!. 
Cons:. good not great picture quality (yet). 
Summary:. BUY IT NOW!!! I LOVE my new ROKU box!! setup was EASY-10 minutes and it was running!lots of future potential thru software upgrades. lots of movies/TV shows to choose from. NO EXTRA RENTAL FEES!!!! inexpensive unit. I am very impressed with this box. The video quality is not quite there yet but has potential to be upgraded over your network. I am VERY HAPPY with it. If you have a netflix subscription, you'd be fool not to use this excellent new tool. I predict it will be the wave of the future.. 

$$;
Pros:. works like it should. 
Cons:. USB port to access other media would be nice. 
Summary:. I have had the Roku box for five days and am very impressed with it. It took less than ten minutes to connect and begin streaming videos. I have a wireless g router about 30 feet away (three walls) and usually get four bars on the signal meter. There are times the internet (Comcast) slows down and the wireless signal decreases. With three or four bars, picture quality is very good for most of the videos I tried.. This little device simply works and works well. It was a no brainer trying it since there is a money back guarantee. As far as some who are concerned with the quality of the movies and videos, out of 10,000 titles everyone should be able to find something of interest. And Netflix continues to add titles all the time. Netflix and Roku have a winner with this little gadget. It works!. 

$$;
Pros:. HDMI - Optical audio - gigabit - svideo - super clear picture - small - pretty. 
Cons:. power adapter cord could be longer.. 
Summary:. I wrote a review and did some scans and pictures at http://mysite.verizon.net/toddlorensinclair/rokureview.htm. 

$$;
Pros:. love the ease of use of handling.. 
Cons:. need more movies to view, but its new also. 
Summary:. i love it, i have had mine for 2 days now, the pic quality is great, the audio is great, and the movies and old programs are very good for viewing. have had no problems with it, they just need to have more movies available, especially the ones that are on being shown on cable now. well worth the $99 investment.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of Use,Simple Interface,Bargain for Netflix Customers. 
Cons:. Limited Movie Selection. 
Summary:. Finally, a company has accomplished what numerous other companies have been promising for years, a way to intregate online movies with your TV wirelessly.As a longtime Netflix subscriber, I ordered a Roku box yesterday.I have watched a few movies using the instant veiwing feature,but who wants to sit in front of their computer to watch movies? Based on the inital reviews of the device,it sounds like the pros outweigh the cons be a large margin.If you are already a Netflix customer, the Roku player is the bargain of the year . To all of the people posting reviews of the device that are critical, I agree that most of the movie selection is limited to old movies (Thanks to the Hollywood Studios)and the picture quality may not be the best,but at last someone has created a simple solution to the problem.And remember,this is only the beginning.. 

$$;
Pros:. Immediate access to many films. 
Cons:. Product in early stages. 
Summary:. I am a long time NF user. This gives me immediate access to much of the BBC without having to connect my computer. Low cost and works well. I don't like the high cost per serving of the others. This is a classic NF approach to its customer base. At a later date the product and do HD. I am just super pleased.I have high end equipment --- tey I am pleased with the video quality with the promise of better to come.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of older movies. 
Cons:. Few newer movies and HD. 
Summary:. This is a simple set up. How do I know, I just did it five minutes ago. If you love movies, which I do and want them with ease then get netflix and this device. You get more and better movies than appletv.. It sits next to my sony viao to20e and 4500 Replaytv, now I have thousands of movies and I still want more.. 

$$;
Pros:. watching movies on demand. 
Cons:. no hdtv quality...yet. 
Summary:. This is the best thing to happen to netflix. ill order my unit right away. I was going to buy a dedicated computer and hook it up to the TV in the living room....now there is no need!. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought the Roku mostly to control the sound with my tv remote so I could lie in bed or the recliner and not have to sit at my computer so as to constantly adjust between the deafeningly loud music and the barely audible dialogue. Great for that.. 
Cons:. I'm a luddite; I don't feel the site told us enough about what we would need in order to hook it up. I had to go buy a router to even set up the account; the instructions that come are not thorough enough since I didn't know how to set my tv input.. 
Summary:. It took customer service three days to tell me some things I could try, instead of just sending me the same instructions that come with the box. People like me need more instructions; sad I know.. But I like the box itself: I've only used it a couple of hours, but does what I wanted it to do. It's great to be able to use my tv remote to control that sound! and not have to get up every five minutes to fiddle with the computer sound. Of course the picture is a little bigger too. Yes I'm glad I bought it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Product works as advertised. Easy setup and reliable operation. Tried it on a fast internet connection and a not so fast connection, works great on both. Video and audio quality depending on the source material are very good.. 
Cons:. Occassionally loses authorized channels after software upgrades and hidden channel additions. A factory reset fixes. Not really a big deal.. 
Summary:. This is the first product I've used that demonstrates the true potential of IP delivered TV. There are many interesting channel sources available with unique content not available over the air, via cable, or via the major DBS providers. At sub $100 prices the Roku is a steal and in my opinion a must have. Get one and have some fun with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to hook up. Remote allows me to easily find channels and shows. Like that I am only paying for the programming that I want and not all the extra that you get with satellite programming. Excellent quality of picture with DSL. No commercials.. 
Cons:. Does not have news from America. Needs more channels. I think that Amazon Video on Demand should charge a monthly flat rate for programming and not charge for single episodes or charge for a season.. 
Summary:. I have only owned the Roku for a day and I am finding that I like the channels and programming that are available, but wish there was more.. I have no complaints about the price of the Roku. Delivery of the Roku was very fast it took four days.. Hooking up the Roku took about 10 minutes and it was very easy.. So far I am spending less on the Roku, for programming that I want. I am not paying for channels that I will never watch, for infomercials, and for the rental of satellite equipment. The Roku takes up less space than my satellite boxes.. I really don't like that Roku does not have any news from America. It only has news from France, Russia, and somewhere else.. I love the amount of programs available on Netflix and the free programming available on Amazon Video on Demand. I wish that Amazon charge a monthly fee for programming like Netflix instead of charging customers per tv episode or for a tv season, but I am willing to pay for the shows that I want because I am still getting better programming than from satellite for less. I love that Amazon provides a large amount of free programming and new release movies.. Anyone who has an Apple i-pod or i-phone will tell you Pandora Radio is great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up.. Allows HD film viewing with standard Netflix account.. Pandora streaming.. 
Cons:. Does not play nice with all routers.. Limited choice of channels.. Limited choice of films on Netflix.. Sometimes film subtitles are cut off.. 
Summary:. The Roku HD box only took me a few minutes to set-up. Having a computer or laptop within viewing distance of the TV screen helps as you have to enter alpha-numeric codes on the websites to enable some features. Some friends of mine had trouble setting it up with their router. I did not.. Besides the Netflix channel, most of the other channels are of limited value. MHZ does offer daily news reports from France 24, RT, ANI, and Aljazeera, but these are added only once a day and are not updated during the weekends. Recently two new channels of old movies were added to the line up (Drive in Classics and Moonlight Movies). These channels have some fun films, but they are all public domain and the worst quality transfers imaginable; a bit like watching old videotapes.. While Netflix offers many films and TV shows, not all of them are available in HD. Many films are not available. And several of the TV shows are already available via Hulu. Showtime seems to be better about providing streaming content than HBO. Since I particularly enjoy documentaries and old TV shows, the Roku box is a perfect match for me, as both these things seem to be well represented on the Roku. I have noticed, however, that occasionally the subtitles on a foreign film will be cut off. I suspect that changing the settings from HD to standard might help this, but that's a bit of a nuisance.. After purchasing the Roku HD box, I reduced my dish service to local channels only and my Netflix delivery to one disk unlimited. These moves cut my monthly entertainment expenditure by nearly the cost of the Roku!. If your interest in movies only extends as far as the latest releases, the Roku box might not be the answer. For everyone else, I strongly recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great 720p streaming video (when it's available). Solid SD picture. Extreme ease of setup and use. Runs great on 100mbps cable modem. 
Cons:. Relative lack of programming in 5.1 audio, mostly in streaming PCM. Some pay per view poorly priced, not the fault of the player. 
Summary:. I have Netflix so even though not much is in 5.1, the selection of movies is pretty good. I still have my unlimited 2 per month to feed the blu-ray habit. The audio is still clear and solid and the 720p stream looks great on a 720p plasma, Internet connectivity is excellent and I can still surf without interference. If you got flat panel TV and home theater, use HDMI and TOSLINK cables and this baby is a sweet addition to the home entertainment setup. Nothing else to say other than shipping was free and the unit came 3 days before the projected delivery date. Don't know why so many reviewers are shedding tears, I know I'm happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Possibility to integrate content with it. 
Cons:. No cons so far. 
Summary:. Hello. The Roku concept is very nice. We are trying to integrate our content with this box. As we already have the box we are doing research now to be able to stream HD content with Roku. I know YouTube has a similar application but we need to bring the streaming experience to the next level. Here is an article talking about this technology: http://www.thehdstandard.com/hd-broadcaster/. ___________________________________. Catalin.

$$;
Pros:. Nice complement to DVR and Netflix subscription for most efficient use of TV time for busy schedules. User friendly for the technology challenged. Good way to control kids' TV time and content plus content is commercial free!. 
Cons:. Netflix selection still sparse; however, great selection of kids shows which substitues for hogging up DVR time. Addition of Amazon a benefit for adult fare but seems silly to pay incrementally to a Netflix subscription.. 
Summary:. Great value given one-time fee for box with no incremental monthly fees!. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap, small footprint, easy to use, acceptable video quality. 
Cons:. Video quality could be better, current library is limited but getting better. 
Summary:. I ordered the Roku Box last weekend on Sunday night and I received it on Friday morning. Shipping is relatively quick but expensive. Honestly, 15 to 20 dollars to ship something so small is kind of a rip-off. Also, they shipped it in it's original packaging rather than packing it in another box. I thought it was weird and kind of irresponsible to ship it that way. Regardless, it shipped just fine with no issues.. The hardware itself, while definitely very basic, seems to of good quality. It's very subtle and discreet - I like that because it's something you can kind of hide and get out of the way. It only includes the composite cables so unless you have a spare HDMI or Component cable, you have to buy one. (If your TV accepts Component or HDMI don't bother with the composite at all!). Setup was a breeze and I successfully set up the Roku Player in 5 minutes time. I have mine attached via Component input to the TV and opted to use the wired connection for the sake of stability and have it plugged into my Router. (Wireless is an option on the Roku box too!). Registering my new Roku box and updating it took less than five minutes on my cable connection which if I am not mistaken is a 7/512 connection last I checked. I already was utilizing the Netflix streaming service with my laptop so I had some movies in my "Watch Now" queue. You need to add movies to the "Watch Now" queue before you can utilize the Roku box so keep that in mind. Anyway, I found the video quality to be surprisingly acceptable although I have been watching a lot of the newer material that is available like Pam's Labyrinth and the series Weeds. My connection was always at 4 so this was good, I attribute this in part to the wired connection although I have not yet tried the Wireless connection out.. In summary, I really like the Roku box. My experience thus far has been largely positive and I find little to complain about considering the cost of the box and the service itself. It really is a great deal - 115 bucks and 10 dollars a month for unlimited streaming content and 1 at a time unlimited DVD's is a steal. My only real complaint is that the content available is lacking. It seems to be getting better and better though so at least they appear to be making an effort to add more content. The other thing that kind of sucks is that some "Watch Now" titles are only available for a limited time before they become unavailable. I'm not sure why this is but I am almost certain it has something to do with the Movie/TV studios freaking out for various silly reasons.. My overall opinion? BUT IT! It's a great deal and it seems to be getting better. (I didn't mention the Amazon option that is available to you as well with the Roku box, but it gives you the option to buy or rent new - meaning current - TV shows or Movies!). 

$$;
Pros:. Video quality, HD connection. Stupid User setup. Don't have to get up to watch my movies and it's Waaaay cheaper than cable.. 
Cons:. The only thing that I though was cheesy was the $20 shipping fee! I mean come on!. 
Summary:. I can't say enough about this thing. I've already gotten 6 people at work to sign up and order the stupid thing. It works flawlessly over the wireless network. And I'm running 2 laptops, 2 desktops, my phone service and a couple printers and so far, never a reset. Of course it's via cable broadband but still just the standard. I was a little concerned that I might have to get the "Turbo" option but it's been absolutely rock solid. The video selection is great and only getting better. And it's included in Netflix for pete's sake. Just awesome. If the Roku people are listening though as far as an upgrade goes.... Two words - hard drive!. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazon On-Demand. Netflix. HD Content. Easy set-up. Wi-fi. 
Cons:. Needs more content choice...maybe Hulu, TV.com, and YouTube. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set-up. Very intuitive navigation. Easy-to-use remote. Video quality. Box is inconspicuous. 
Cons:. Depending on where the video is streamed from, the video is not DVD quality.. Sometimes a video fails to buffer, or takes a long time. 
Summary:. I love my Roku. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, compliment my 3 DVD at a time subscription. I won't complain about the list of videos available for streaming, most of the videos I have in my "Instant" queue are older anyway, so it nice to watch something old if all my DVD's are in the mail. It was very easy to install and get running.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely easy setup; decent quality, ok selection.. 
Cons:. Works best outside of "prime time" when quality/buffering can be problems.. 
Summary:. Easily the simplest computer-type setup ever - 5 minutes after opening the box a movie was playing inlcuding wireless setup. Quality is SDTV or better even after the 1.5 upgrade unless you have "four dots", which is common off-peak hours and somewhat rare in prime time (7pm-11pm). I have seen the buffering issues that people complain about, again mostly in prime time. I suspect this is a netflix server-side issue as my internet download speeed averages about 7Mb/s. Still, to get "free" access to movies that are as good or better than the typical HBO/SHO fare I think this box is a great deal - the savings from dropping premium channels will pay for the box in about 6 months.. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredibly easy to set up. Recognized the wireless network and hooked into my Netflix instant queue in a heartbeat. Very easy to get movies to play, rewind, fast forward, etc.. 
Cons:. Catalog of content needs to grow, especially with newer DVD releases. Quality of the stream has four settings dependent on the broadband speed, etc. Most of my movies have been at the #2 setting which was good, not great on a 42 inch Sony LCD.. 
Summary:. I got it for Christmas and it already has had immediate use. As I grow Netflix enabled devices in my home (i.e. Blu Ray player, XBOX, etc), I could see moving this little box into the bedroom.. If you are a Netflix user, there really isn't a downside to this little gadget.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, setup, general movie quality.. 
Cons:. film selection is mostly older, NO HD (well not yet), recent issues with quality.you have to use the website to choose movies. No internal choosing function.. 
Summary:. Bottom line if you have been thinking about getting this and you already have a $8.99 or above netflix plan you should go for it! I know you can stream from the laptop to the TV but this makes it much easier.. 

$$;
Pros:. From opening the box to watching the first movie, the total time was just under 10 minutes. The user interface is very simple and easy to understand using the even simpler remote. Auto quality detection is a nice feature.. 
Cons:. If you have anything less than 1.5MB/s connection, you may be in for some frustration. When your connection speed fluctuates too much, the movie re-buffers to the higher/lower quality ... very frustrating. This is not an issue with higher bandwidth.. 
Summary:. For someone looking for quick and easy access to a growing selection of movies, this is a great addition to any gadget collection. After adding the price of the box to the mid-level Netflix subscription fee, this is a GREAT value. It may be a little frustrating for videophiles who can't live with less than perfect images. A solid, high-speed connection is highly recommended to prevent annoying re-buffering in the middle of the action. Running the box wirelessly is a no-brainer. It is helpful to have a laptop handy during set-up so you can get your access code quickly and finish the ridiculously easy set-up.. Having the ability to stop a movie at any point and come back to that same place at any time is a big plus ... no time limits. The selection of movies could be better, but for a new device and service it does the job twice over. Keep the new movies coming NetFlix!!! However, if you LOVE Gene Autry, you will go insane with the amount of Gene Autry movies available. LOL.. We went without cable TV for over 3 years and are still going strong. This device and a Netflix subscription is a great value and gives you more control over your entertainment. This is MUCH BETTER than trying to watch movies on a laptop :). 

$$;
Pros:. Able to view all your titles in your Watch Instantly list. Easy installation and easy to use functionality.. 
Cons:. Customer service by Roku for defective units or remotes needs to be improved. Not all titles are in widescreen format. Does not have surround sound ability on titles. Not able to stream in HD yet.. 
Summary:. This is a perfect alternative for those who do not watch or want to pay for cable or other media services. Would recommend to anyone who loves Netflix.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great video quality, simple to use. 
Cons:. Need more titles. Remote a little spartan. No power off button.. 
Summary:. I know CNET said this had mediocre quality, but I was quite surprised at how good the quality is. Maybe it's improved since this review or maybe I just have faster internet and a better TV. I have a 46 inch Sharp 1080p with the Roku connected via HDMI. My internet is FIOS 10Mbit. I tried composite first, before I got my HDMI cable, and there is a big difference between that and HDMI. I'd say it is darn close to DVD quality. I have a Heroes disk and compared that to the Roku, and at best the difference was marginal. In some dark scenes you can see the extra compression show through, still, it's hard to tell going back and forth, but it is way better the the standard def from Verizon FIOS, which is way better than the standard def from Comcast. Definitely needs more titles, but we have used it a lot so far for catching up on some TV series and watching a few old movies, and they are coming out with more each day. They are claiming HD in the future, so that would be great. Easily worth the 100 dollars if you already have a Netflix account.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1) Easy set-up. 2) Easy queue selections on PC. 3) Lots of terrific classics and newer, too - ON DEMAND. 4) New movies added every day. 5) Picture resolution/quality varies - but still looks good on 50" Plasma. 6) Stop and Resume at any time. 
Cons:. Not many cons except the various resolution issues and some movies not in wide-screen.. Of course, the addition of HD and increased selections will be a positive.. 
Summary:. I'm very impressed.. For the almost unreasonably low price (all movies thru Roku are FREE except for monthly NetFlix account fee) and instant viewing of a large selection of very agreeable movies and TV shoes, this product and service cannot be beat (yet).. I'm impressed with the realization that: THIS IS THE FUTURE, AND IT IS ALMOST NOW! DVDs will be an antiquated medium sooner than you think.. Who would I recommend this product/service to? From many of the negative reviews I've seen, I would not recommend to younger 'must have the latest blockbuster' crowd... or the video-phile who needs the highest definition.. 

$$;
Pros:. HDMI, Component, Optical Audio and Composit outputs - who could ask for more? Very simply setup.. 
Cons:. even on fast cable internet, it's not "Instant" by any stretch of the imagination. It takes about 15-90 seconds to buffer the movie. Quality on large screens is noticeably worse than HD. Depth of new titles is very poor.. 
Summary:. You get what you pay for. This is a very cheap box connecting to a low cost service so I don't expect perfection, and you don't get it here. For what you pay, you get an excellent product. Lets hope Netflix will offer a premium plan in the future with newer, higher quality titles.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy installation, easy to use. 
Cons:. picture could be a little sharper. 
Summary:. Great tool for viewing movies on your TV from your netflix instant view online library. Love mine. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up, takes up no space and is very cheapconsidering the technology that's in the box.. 
Cons:. New movies is lacking but lots of old TV shows I grew up with are out there.... 
Summary:. The product does what's advertised and makes it easy to stream content to a TV. I would hope that Netflix might consider a tiered service that allows you to pay a little more to get newer movie and TV content...all in all its an amazing little device.. Updated. on Jan 29, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Very reasonably priced, no additional netflix fee required, easy to setup and flexible. 
Cons:. Video quality limited by internet connection speed, no "store forward" capability. 
Summary:. I've been a netflix member for years. I love it, but I often find that I'm in the mood to watch something other than what I currently have rented. So I figured I would try out this device to give me a new way to watch things more dynamically.. The device is very flexible, offering a variety of ways to hook into your A/V system, and to your network. The remote is very simple and easy to use, and if you're a harmony remote user, there are configurations online to program your remote easily.. Overall, I'm very pleased with Roku player. In my situation, I've got it connected to the internet via DSL, which is typically running at about 1.2Mb down. This gets me a quality of 2 out of 4. I would equate this to a VHS quality video. I really wish I had a faster pipe to the internet to get a better quality video. But it is sufficient.. As others have mentioned, the current selection on netflix is limited. I'm finding it's a great way to catch up on old TV shows (Kolchak the Night Stalker, Dragnet, etc). There are also quite a few cheesy slasher flicks available which I'm a sucker for. There are also quite a few documentaries available (Nova, etc). But don't expect big hollywood blockbusters, at least for now.. Here's a couple of "wishes" for the next generation box:. 1) Given my bandwidth limitation, I wish there was a way to "download" and temporarily store a higher quality version of a show. I wouldn't mind waiting an hour to start watching a show if I could get a higher quality picture.. 2) You have to add stuff to your "video on demand" queue via online browser netflix access. I wish you could browse what is available via the Roku box.. 3) There's no way to turn off this device (at least I couldn't find a way). I'd prefer to have it off if I'm not using it, though I'm sure the power draw is minimal.. But on the whole, I'm really enjoying it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, no additional monthly cost, component outs, HDMI, firmware upgrades, very good picture quality.. 
Cons:. Tracking (forwarding, reversing) a bit archaic, with a need to wait for buffering even when just rewinding a few seconds. Need pretty fast wireless to get premium picture quality. Available titles.. 
Summary:. Killer box. Every netflix owner should own this to get the most out of their membership.. Netflix needs to tweak a few things but that goes with any "1.0" box. That's what the firmware upgrades are for.... 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to setup. 
Cons:. Netflix instant watching selection. 
Summary:. Love this product. Works great without any issues. I only wish that Netflix will add ore movies and shows to their instant watch list.. 

$$;
Pros:. Really Easy. 
Cons:. Netflix selection. 
Summary:. The only con is that the pool of Netflix Instant Watch movies is heavily stocked with documentaries, foreign films, and old movies (snoooze, snore, snoooze some more). Occasionally you do find a good movie available for instant watch or that is already in your dvd mail queue. If you are on a budget like me and only pay for the one dvd at-a-time plan like me, it really helps you out between postal delays waiting for your next dvd to arrive. Netflix might have to rethink this... why would anybody want to upgrade their plan to more movies at a time when there are Free instant watch movies to tide you over until your next DVD arrives?. 

$$;
Pros:. saves money &#38; time, never run out of copies, convenient, watch movies on the fly, cost effective. 
Cons:. need to get better video quality, can not add to quece with box only with your computer. 
Summary:. the picture quality is the only thing that is a real con. This may not be the fault of the box. this may really be the fault of the sever streaming the video. I have to buy another box. I have to have one for the other tv for my wife to have up stairs. The cost of the box is worth giving a chance $100 dollar is a great price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use; delivers high-quality video at no extra cost; more like a version 3 than a version 1 product.. 
Cons:. None significant: the limitations are mostly with available content, which is a contract/security issue with the movie studios. Opening the remote control to change batteries is difficult.. 
Summary:. Netflix and Roku really know what they are doing: this $100 Player easily hooks up to your TV and broadband/wireless Internet connection, and gives you high-quality, immediate access to everything in your Netflix "Watch Instantly" queue, at no extra charge. Installation and setup worked properly the first time, and most of the 10 minute setup was spent entering my wireless security ID through the on-screen keyboard.. Video quality on my 46" Sony LCD is similar to DVD quality: barely less good than a store-bought commercial DVD, at least as good as, if not better than, a 2-hour DVD recording of a digital cable channel. HD is not available yet, but they say the box can handle it via a (presumably free) Firmware update, when/if Netflix can offer Instant HD content.. You have to have a good broadband/wireless connection to use this, just as you do to use "Watch Instantly" on your computer or laptop. Reception was fine at 1.0 megabits/second; when I moved the Player and base station around to get 1.5 mps, I didn't see any difference. When they start offering HD content, I'll probably want to boost the signal strength on my Access Point.. I've read two kinds of reviews of this product: tepid ones from people who do not seem to have actually used it, and raves from almost everyone who is using it.. As of June, 2008, Netflix has about 10,000 "Instant" titles available, and few, if any, are new or recent releases. That's got to be a licensing issue, and like most business problems, it can be solved in time with money (pay the studios higher royalties, charge customers something for new releases).. For people like me, older movies and documentaries are of greater interest than new releases, so there's more than enough content already available to make this device a "must-have.". If you have an "unlimited" Netflix subscription, you'll want to give serious thought to adding this Player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap. It works. Decent video/audio quality.. 
Cons:. Netflix servers sometimes go down.. 
Summary:. I've had the Roku box for a week, and I'm thoroughly satisfied. Setup did require a call to Roku cust. service but it ended up being a router issue: had to turn off the firewall. Since then Netflix servers have gone down twice for an hour or so. My TV is a 63" Samsung DLP, and I use Cox high speed internet. I am using a Belkin g band wireless router to carry the signal. The unit is plugged into the TV using HDMI. Video quality is always 4 stars (the best). The picture has not been choppy nor does it freeze. I have encountered brief pixelation but that is not the norm. Audio to my home stereo using RCA jacks is ok. Most of the selections I've watched had the same quality as my Direct TV SD broadcasts. Some looked better and some worse.. Nearly every review you read about this new service has one major complaint: limited content. I agree. Netflix needs to keep up their efforts to expand the selection. I'm confident they will. In the meantime, expand your viewing tastes; try something new and different. I've found a few diamonds in the rough plus there is quite a selection of new and old TV shows that I never bothered with because I hate commercials. Overall I am very satisfied with the box and the service. I look forward to future upgrades. My grade: B+.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheaper than digital cable w/on-demand. 
Cons:. The usual (not HD quality, limited content). 
Summary:. DISCLAIMER: I haven't used this product yet, but I HAVE used the Netflix streaming on my PC (with my 37" HDTV as a monitor), and I think the picture quality is acceptable.. Anyway.... If you already have broadband Internet, and you're happy with the content that Netflix DOES offer (like I am), then this gadget is a great deal compared to an on-demand digital cable package:. Netflix:. - "Setup" fee (i.e. buying the box): $100. - Monthly fee: $9 and up. On-demand Cable:. - Setup fee: $???. - Monthly fee: $50 and up (plus per-view charges?). Also, remember that Netflix will still happily mail you a DVD the old-fashioned way, if the stuff you want isn't available for streaming.. 

$$;
Pros:. it looks like it is easy to set up. 
Cons:. they need greater variety of titles. 
Summary:. I think this is a step in the right direction. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use, simple interface. 
Cons:. Unability to add movies to queue without PC. 
Summary:. I feel like some of the other reviews have been unfair. This box does exactly what it claims to. It allows you to play Netflix "Watch It Now" movies on your TV without a PC.. The setup was extremely easy and took me less than 5 minutes to get working. Playback starts in about 10 seconds with most of the content I have tried so far and the quality is pretty good. The low and med quality streams do look pretty bad for those with slower Internet connections. Fortunately I haven't had to worry about that.. I thought about giving this device a much lower score because of Netflix lacking content library, but it's not really the fault of the box. The one gripe I do have is not being able to add items to my queue from the TV interface. Instead I have to login to my PC and add movies to my Watch it now" queue. Seems like something that could be fixed with future firmware updates.. Overall a great product with huge potential if Netflix starts expanding their content library.. 

$$;
Pros:. Streams movies to your TV. Firmware is upgradeable. Decent picture quality. 
Cons:. not enough movie selection, needs surround sound, better video quality.. 
Summary:. First I'd like to note how idiotic some people can be. If you thought the picture looked bad on your small computer screen, and expected it to look better on a bigger screen you are gravely mistaken. Although internet connections are getting faster, streaming HD content is extremely taxing on a network and since this is the first gen model, I'm pleasantly surprised at it's quality. If you don't think there's much selection you should realize that netflix adds new titles every week!! So the library is constantly growing. They can't get the rights or won't pay the outlandish prices to gain the rights to stream movies. There is a lot of legal red tape involved with getting the rights to putting a movie into a network for people to view and we'll probably never get instant access to new releases(though it could happen). Besides most new movies are garbage, do yourself a favor and browse through older movies and watch some classics, if you don't like it it's not like you had to pay for it.. in the end you have to look at the pricetag. This is priced around the same price as a low end dvd player and it has much more functionality compared to them. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to watch movies period. It's not a huge investment, it's not a perfect fit for everyone BUT remember with firmware upgrades, I am betting that the HDMI output will be getting 5.1 surround sound some time in the near future. If you're waiting for an HD model to come out, remember you may be paying twice as much if not more, for the higher resolution.. 

$$;
Pros:. This feature on PS3 or XBOX would rock!. 
Cons:. Can't come soon enough. 
Summary:. Quote from Netflix site: "We are working to get TV manufacturers, Blu-ray player manufacturers, and game console manufacturers to make their devices ready for instant streaming from Netflix. The first of these multi-function Netflix ready devices are likely to be available in late 2008.". Hope it happens! Have a PS3 and Netflix already.. 

$$;
Pros:. $100, user friendly, inexpensive subscription. 
Cons:. WIDESCREEN, title selection is thin, cant play dvds. 
Summary:. first off, most of my reviews are home theater biased so excuse me if i dont list everything. i appreciate netflix efforts to remain king of video. however, if you already have a pc in your home theater setup you dont need the netflix box and if you dont already have a pc, you dont want this (the hp slimline is still my pick for netflix in the living room).for those of you who have extra inputs, it cant even play dvds so is it even worth taking up space in your setup (except bragging). when i purchased this today i was expecting the online movie roster to be updated with the release of the box. it wasnt and the movies you would want to watch online arent widescreen anyway. also if you're used to being emersed in sound you'll get irritated with this box as surround sound isnt supported yet. i agree with the cnet editor this is a going in my kids room... with less disc to worry about and no moving parts to shove cookies into.. even better as my kids tv on has two hd inputs so i can use the netflix box s-video input for setup. also, apple tv, archos tv, vuduu are much more expensive its really a steal at $100 and if your like most of the country you already have a netflix account for your dvd's anyway so its an added bonus.. you can purchase the netflix box with the refunds they were offering to those of you with hd-dvd players.. 

$$;
Pros:. 10,000 movies. 
Cons:. No HD or the entire Netflix selection at present. 
Summary:. I've been using Netflix for 5yrs, it's almost flawless. This device will make the easy mailing part disappear!. I look forward to when Netflix offers there COMPLETE movie catalog and HD content to this nifty device!. Netflix, another great idea.. This should put some emphasis on Blockbuster to offer a similar device or...perish!. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well with netflix and pandora. I use it at least once a day. The remote works well and has a wide beam spread which is nice because I don't have to point it straight at the player like I have to with my DVD player.. 
Cons:. Power supply failed after a couple of years and you can't update the queue easily from the player. They have gotten better with the latest firmware but I would like a more robust search.. 
Summary:. I am happy with my player and would recommend it to others. I used to connect my laptop to my TV to watch instant movies and now I don't have to. The power supply failed like I said, and I mitigated that by wiring a 4 cell AA battery pack to it. I am an electrical engineer and I fixed this safely. Read up before you try it though. Alternately you can buy a 6V 2A power supply from somewhere and replace the one you get from the factory. Note that they may have gotten better since I bought mine a while back, but just know this could be a problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick access to movies, large selection, no long waits or lines to stand in. One low fee gets you access to thousands of movies in an instant. You still have an option to view new movies through the mail.. 
Cons:. Price was a bit higher, I opted to buy the HD wireless option. My interent company is a bit sketchy sometimes so hopefully I can stay connected long enough to watch one. I just received it and only viewed one so far.. 
Summary:. I was anxious to get this because I love movies and even waiting to get them in the mail sometimes sucks. So I thought if I could watch them instantly and not have to leave the house to even return them to the post office it would be worth it. So far I like it. The picture quality is not outstanding by any means but it's good enough for the price. I don't like the fact that it has not power off button? Why is this again? I haven't had too much time to form too much of an opinion but I'm hoping to enjoy it this weekend. It's cold and what's better than to curl up and watch a movie? My internet company is kind of sketchy so I hope that I don't loose an internet connection while trying to watch one. I do have high-speed but it goes out for some reason quite a bit. Hopefully I will get my moneys worth!.

Pros:. The Roku is a wonderful, simple and easy to use product which delivers movies instantly to your TV. I am a movie lover and this product has been a god-send to me and allowed me to save money by downgrading my cable package!. 
Cons:. One HUGE problem is that the Netflix connection does not allow for new releases and has made new release via mail annoying. Also, you cannot browse via the device to add movies, or sort them in category, alpha or otherwise; they are randomly listed.. 
Summary:. This is a great product and the beginning of the future for television. I would still recommend this over the Apple TV based on cost alone, but there are several simple features that if they were added would make this product a 5 for me. I would like to see added the user ability to search and add movies to the queue, the ability to sort movies via category or alphabetically. Also, the access to new releases would be great. If Netflix had a separate package online which would allow for new releases and I had to pay a little more ($15/month) - I would immediately sign up. However, at $10 a month I can't even get the Sex and The City series, Seinfeld and extremely limited new release options. Receiving the newer DVDs via mail has become annoying after getting used to the Roku features. For anyone that has a hard time understanding technology this is a perfect fit because there are literally just a few plugs, connection to your wireless environment and you?re all set! I also like the fact that there is access now to Amazon?s Video on Demand.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, Easy of use, Video Quality. 
Cons:. Lack of Available Titles. I have only gotten through one movie without it having to pause to buffer.. 
Summary:. Without a doubt this is a great addition to any Netflix member. So easy to set up, and so easy to use. Obviously in a perfect world all new releases would be available. Slowly but surely the movie selection is getting better, but this box is not going to replace the DVD in the mail service anytime soon. The most frustrating thing with the box is that after watching about 8 movies, only one had a perfect run the entire movie. Every other movie I watched paused at least one time during playback to buffer. It was not a huge deal because it usually only happens one time per movie and only for about 15 seconds, but still, I don't want it to happen at all. Also when I watched one movie the audio track was so out of sync to the video it was unwatchable.. Updated. on Feb 12, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Convenient and easy to use. Simple setup. Decent quality picture and sound (gets the job done to my satisfaction). 
Cons:. Cannot browse or add movies from the box. Cannot categorize movies. Everything has to be done on the computer before hand.. 
Summary:. Someone should make a player that will allow a person to browse for a movie while sitting on the couch with guests or family. Instead, we have to think of a ton of movies in advance, and hope the guest will like at least 1 of them. Otherwise, you have to leave your guests and go back on the computer to add more.. Overall, it is limited, but good for the movies that they do have. I really hope that netflix adds to the selection. Blockbuster Instant viewing, although you have to pay $1.99ea viewing, has a great selection.. Updated. on Jan 17, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to set up. Simple to use. Picture quality is everything I expected. Wireless connection easily provides enough bandwidth for quick movie loading. Priced well. 
Cons:. Limited movie selection. You must add movies to a queue from a computer in order to watch them. 
Summary:. Overall I am so very pleased. I'm watching Legends of the Fall at this very moment. Buy it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the Roku when it works.... 
Cons:. Useless customer service and news shows that do not play all the way through-EVER. 
Summary:. Since owning the Roku (3 months), I have yet to watch a full news show; anything over an hour simply cuts out at the half hour mark and will not reload. I have called customer service where they are happy to repeat what I have said before providing useless suggestions, sent unanswered emails and tonight spent 1 hour and half using their "live chat" (I was told my wait would be 12 minutes, it was 30). I was then asked the same questions over and over and still no resolution. I am still trying.... 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use; lots of choices. 
Cons:. less than desireable quality. 
Summary:. If there was a way to JUST subscribe to Roku-available videos and not get any movies via mail, at a price, say, five bucks a month, I'd go for it. I don't order any Netflix movies by mail and so I feel ripped off having to pay 9 dollars a month just like those who use that service.. 

$$;
Pros:. FREE MOVIES.well almost free with the basic $8.00 per month plan you can download as many movies as you wish.. The unit setup is very easy,plus it has built in wifi.. 
Cons:. Video quality can be poor at times,audio quality is not that great either.. 
Summary:. I have owned a ROKU since the start of the summer,at a base price of $99.00 it's a great buy,all you need to download movies is the $8.00 a month plan.With that said there are several short comings to the plan.First the "Watch Now" list is for the most part populated with third tier or lower movies,the T.V. series fair is just a bit better.Even though I access the internet via cable, streaming can be a little slow,and the box can freeze up.But if you already have a NetFlix plan then this is a great buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to operate, nice picture quality on our high def TV. growing selection of movies, even though most available titles are oldies. but it's obvious netflix is expanding the library.. 
Cons:. sound is very fuzzy. hard to hear most tv showes and there's no caption! so i am stuck with watching foreign movies most of the time. although i am a big fan of foreign cinema, sometimes i'd like to be able to watch showes like heroes.. 
Summary:. sound quality needs to be improved, caption capabilitiy added.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super easy to set up and use,great value. 
Cons:. Netflix selection is limited (but still alot out there). 
Summary:. I got this a couple of weeks ago and it has been awesome. Though, the selection of "Watch Now" movies is limited, there has still been enough for me to add over 200 titles to my queue. This includes about 50 or so that I've added for my 5-year-old son. This is where it's been REALLY great since he doesn't care about when something came out--if it has something interesting for him, he's happy. There are all kinds of nature documentaries--including Walking With Dinosaurs and Walking With Prehistoric Beasts. There are a bunch of Land Before Time movies and other Don Bluth movies like Secret of Nimh and All Dogs Go to Heaven. There are also tons of Wiggles videos which he has outgrown but will be nice when our 6-month old gets a little older. It's just nice to be able to put something right up without having to go and find the disc, load it, etc... Especially for when my technically challenged mother-in-law comes over to babysit. She LOVES it. I don't want to make it sound like all our son does is sit and watch t.v. but for those times when he does, this has been a great option.. What about the grown-ups? Well, as I mentioned, you aren't going to find the latest new releases but I've been pleasantly surprised by some of the things that are out there. I am a child of the '70's and '80's so I was excited to find alot of movies like Ghostbusters, Stir Crazy, Modern Problems,Every Which Way But Loose, Risky Business and others I grew up with. I also found some good stand-up comedy including Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor. For the wife, I found some older Julia Roberts like Notting Hill, Steel Magnolias, My Best Friend's Wedding.. There are also quite a few TV show options like Heroes and 30 Rock--two of my favorite shows. There is also alot of Showtime content such as Weeds and Dexter which I am looking forward to checking out.. Anyway, I am very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend for anyone with small kids and/or who likes to go back and watch older favorites.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great access to Pandora for music and Netflix for streaming videos (though your Netflix account must be "unlimited"). 
Cons:. Once you subscribe to a channel, you're stuck with it. There's no way to unsubscribe. Roku Help says contact the channel vendor, but there is no vendor for some of the channels, and for others no discernable way to unsubscribe. Be cautious.. 
Summary:. Very nice for streaming Netflix videos and Pandora music - but there's no way to tell what's on the other channels without subscribing to them. And, once you've subscribed, there's no way I can find to unsubscribe to them.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Easy way to get movies and TV show DVDs without waiting for them in the mail. 
Cons:. 1. No hard drive, so no caching! This is a big Con.. 2. Apparently uses all available bandwidth. 
Summary:. People are so stupid in these reviews, especially talking about 1080p. Are you serious? There is nothing available at that resolution except bluray. As to 720p or some other high def format, think about what this device is replacing - DVDs. Those are 480 lines. So you are getting DVD movies and TV shows streamed direct to your TV without having to wait for them in the mail. That is pretty nice.. There is no hard drive to cache to. That means if you fast forward or rewind it starts downloading again. This really sucks!. The internet is slow if someone tries to use the computer at the same time as watching a show.. Updated. on Nov 14, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Low Price. Small Footprint. Easy Setup. Acceptable Quality. 
Cons:. Can not get fast forward to work within a netflix movie. Tech support doesn't seem to read the symptoms. Still, I remain hopeful I can get this resolved.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use machine, very basic functions. 
Cons:. Customrer service is a nightmare. We received new product, poorly packaged for shipping that did not work. Took over a dozen emails and finally nearly one hour on the phone to get a replacement unit. BEWARE. 
Summary:. Look at alternative products. check out the bulletin board reviews from other customers prior to buying this product. Roku clears believes it is acceptable to ingore the consumer. Buyer beware. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. A good internet connection is required. 
Summary:. I used this on a low end internet speed service. It worked but was not perfect. I think the next gen boxes with broadband bonding (or similar) technology will be much better. Once improved, this is defintely the way to go in the future!. 

$$;
Pros:. Works great for a cheep price.. 
Cons:. Loads slowly and breaks after a year just after warranty. 

$$;
Pros:. cool Netflix movies if you have an older/not top of the line network (G). 
Cons:. Does not support N networks.. 
Summary:. I love it when new tech comes out that requires old tech. Why do those of us that have N wireless networks have them? Increased Range? Check. Increased Speed? Check. Great for gaming and watching movies and shows, etc. Aren't we the same folks who would love a Netflix Device? Heck Yeah! How about a little love for the tech savvy "N" peeps Roku and Netflix???. 

$$;
Pros:. Not too Expensive. 
Cons:. Less than Stellar Video Quality. 
Summary:. Well if you're looking to bring a little more media to your entertainment experience this might be a justifiable purchase. However with HD slowly becoming the standard do you really want to watch something with less than DVD video quality? You've got better options, I'd say first would be the Xbox 360 it boast an HD on demand like service (pay per film/TV show) and soon will be sporting Netflix in a recently announced exclusive partnership. If you're not too keen on the Xbox, the Playstation 3 is starting to offer a service very similar to Microsoft's Xbox Live service, minus the the Netflix, but is arguably the best blu ray player on the market. If you're looking for just a simple video player, minus video games and social networks then Vudu might be a better option, its offers an HD pay as you go no membership, you just buy the hardware.. Now if you're not in the HD realm just yet, then SNAP out of it! Save the money you'd spend on this and buy one of the above mentioned products even an HD DVR would be a good start, but if you insist on having standard def as your standard then you can justify this purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Concept. 
Cons:. Limited Image Quality with Standard Cable Modum Connection, Difficult Set-up. 
Summary:. Great product in theory, however, it will not play through my brand-new, mid range receiver (Sony STR-DA4300) because of its digital rights management software and image quality is limited without a relatively fat internet connection. It took me three calls and one and a half hours to learn that the promised one line HDMI connection promised was not delivered. The tech support crew told me that they do not support or trouble shoot the product when not connected directly to a television--which begs the question, how many early adopters don't use some sort of receiver, switch, or other intermediary device?. 

$$;
Pros:. I'm neutral as I haven't purchased it. 
Cons:. I'm neutral as I haven't purchased it. 
Summary:. I have never seen Apple place advertising on CNET. However, I have seen much advertising from Netflix.. Doesn't this create at least an appearance of impropriety on CNET review?. 

$$;
Pros:. not too expensive. 
Cons:. not too useful. 
Summary:. The neat thing is the idea of being able to stream flicks to your TV from the internet. But based on the selection of titles available as of 05/20/08, it seems this thing will only be clutter on the TV stand.. If you find 20,30,40,50 year old movies entertaining to watch and do so on a regular basis then this would be a good addition to your entertainment system.. If you think On-Demand services in general to have boring content then you should probably wait until the next version.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well designed, easy to use. 
Cons:. Untrustworthy company.. 
Summary:. This is a very nice product, however, this company employs deceptive sales / marketing tactics. I was solicited via email to purchase this product at a (one day only) sale price and given a code to enter at checkout. When I got to checkout there was no indication that the sale was over, no place to enter a code and no way to edit / cancel the order. In fact there was no 'Place order' or 'Checkout' button only a 'Continue to Checkout' button that actually placed the order. Not the usual retail web-app work flow to say the least. My emails to cancel the order before shipping was ignored. As I said nice product but this company is not to be trusted, Netflix should be more careful who it does business with.. 

$$;
Pros:. Player is very well designed and easy to install.. 
Cons:. - Player should support 1080p in addition to 720p. 
Summary:. The content is very poor from Netflix. It hurts people playing $140 including shipping and cables and watch sick movies.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought it and the idea is wonderful.. 
Cons:. They are having serious problems with a re-buffering issue. This issue has made this box useless. I would check Roku forums before buying.. 
Summary:. Wait.. 

$$;
Pros:. Once it is set up, easy to operate, fair/decent picture quality. 
Cons:. Not a good product for older TV sets, price, ff/rewind controls are slow and clunky. 
Summary:. I purchased two of these, one for myself and one as a gift. Mine was easy to install and worked fairly well (other than rewinding and fast forwarding functionality which is awkward and slow). I tried to install the gift on someone else's older tv set (which it was advertised as easily compatible with). Unfortunately, that set only had one input which was already being used for cable into an rf modulator. The inputs on the modulator were being used for an existing dvd player (pretty typical). I was told by customer service to purchase a better rf modulator with a S-video jack which I did along with a cable ($50). Unfortunately, there was no way to switch between the player and the dvd player without buying ADDITIONAL equipment. When you start adding all of this up you might as well go buy a tivo or xbox device with the additional functionality they offer. We decided to return the unit. However, they do not include return information or shipping instructions with the product and you have to contact Customer Service which I had to do several times via email and phone before I could get the return information. That really is unacceptable!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. Tiny set of (bad) movies. 
Summary:. What no one likes to mention is how small is the catalog of movies for Roku. Netflix only offers a tiny subset of their titles for the Roku, nowhere near their list of fllms even for PC instant viewing. And not the good movies either. The titles available for Roku are the obscure and low-popularity films.. Worse: Netflix isn't digitizing new titles very quickly for Roku. I've been a member for over 2 months and I'd say they add maybe 5 new titles a week for Roku. And again: not good movies.. Reviewers like to focus on the technical capability of the Roku box. But they don't mention how lackluster the actual movie selections are for Roku. It is definitely NOT anything like having Netflix available for streaming. Just way too few titles to pick from.. 

$$;
Pros:. Going toward the right direction. 
Cons:. Older OS will not benefit from this. 
Summary:. Long time Netflix subscriber, but can not take advantage of movie viewing on PC. They are leaving lots of people behind. We have to either invest on a new PC and struggle with VISTA or go to MAC.. 

$$;
Pros:. Uses Netflix service. 
Cons:. Not even DVD video quality, No 5.1 surround support...yet.. 
Summary:. I was looking forward to this box, at least in concept; but after reading the review, and learning the specifics, I'm not sure who this device is targeted toward. Most videophiles and audiophiles who purchase the cutting edge technologies will want a picture at least as good as standard DVDs. And if there is no 5.1 surround, why would I bother to buy this device (even at $99.99) and hook it up to my home theater system? If it only streams computer grade video, I can watch the paltry few available titles on my computer monitor. In my opinion, it's not yet good enough to bother with. It looks like I may still have to purchase that Blu-ray disc player.. 

$$;
Pros:. just nothing good about it; I gave 1.5 stars as the site doesn't allow any less.. 
Cons:. 1) too expensive. 2) it's used only for streaming. 3) customer support is unprofessional and not helpful. 
Summary:. i bought this device for netflix two years ago. Any newer blu-ray or tv is netflix ready offering better performance and, for some, good customer service within the US. Doesn't make sense to use Roku. I still have it but don't use it anymore.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it worked, I liked it.. 
Cons:. Suddenly stopped working. I will NOT replace, but will instead use DVD from Netflix to connect PS3 to Netflix. At least Sony builds a quality product and I don't worry about the unit suddenly failing.. 
Summary:. I would NOT purchase a Roku unless you are willing to buy a new unit every 12 months or so. Maybe you could buy them in bulk and keep a supply stashed away..
