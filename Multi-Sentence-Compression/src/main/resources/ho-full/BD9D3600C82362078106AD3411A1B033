booked here as had a late flight into valetta and the reviews were so positive on this site .
we were given a pokey cupboard of a room with a tiny bathroom .
it was fine for our purposes of getting our heads down but if i was staying longer than 1 night i would be disappointed and probably would n't have stayed .
neighbouring room came back to their room about 3am and we could hear every bit of conversation , squeak of bed and flush of toilet , so that interrupted our much needed sleep .
the breakfast room is on a terrace on the 8th floor so it goes without saying that the views are absolutely amazing across the bay to valetta .
otherwise , the choice leaves a lot to be desired - little apples and little oranges made up the fresh fruit selection , then the usual pastries , bread , filter coffee .
okay , but not sure it was worth the extra we paid ( which was challenged when we arrived for breakfast as they had us down as room only. .
) probably have been better off going outside to the wide selection of cafes and restaurants .
out of curiosity we went up another floor to the 'hot tub/jacuzzi ' which was out of action and the rooms up there were like being in a youth hostel , although in fairness there were renovation signs up , so maybe in the height of the season it will be a bit more attractive . . . .

it served its purpose for one night but would n't have stayed any longer .
staff were nice enough if a bit detached , quite relaxed about us leaving luggage , seemed happy enough for us to work the system out for ourselves .
wifi okay but not strong enough for youtube or any streaming.
