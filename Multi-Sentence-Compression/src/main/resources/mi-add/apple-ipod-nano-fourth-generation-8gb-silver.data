this is my third nano , but this is the best  .
i love the tilt sensor just shake the ipod and random music  .
connect the ipod headphones with control and mic and you have a recorder and all functions controlled in a little box , amazing  .
bottom line , this ipod sounds great to me , along with the features , and good price , makes this a nice buy  .
the only problem i can complain about is it freezing  .
it is quite a pain to restart  .
as for the scratching , or the the finger print magnet screen , they do make cases for such problems  .
also people who complain about the shuffle feature or the accelerometer , fyi you can shut both features off via ipod .
i like the product in general  .
this new ipod is apple's way of progressing , and considering i'm typing this review on a macbook pro i would have to say i'm a die    hard apple user  .
for those of you that are not , i'm sorry , and i pitty you on your computer choice  .
just stay open minded and if you do not like the new software in the ipod , then buy a first or second gen at www  .
ebay  .
com and be happy , yo .
i have the pink one that i got for my b    day  .
i take it with me almost everywhere  .
if you want an ipod thats easy on your eyes and wallet then i suggest this  .
the earbuds , of any kind i cannot get them to stay properly seated in my ear  .
actually use panasonic mini wrap    around ear type ear    phones , they stay in place .
i just love it  .
itunes 8 is easy to use , too  .
its my fist ipod so i guess  .
it is a perfect ipod  .
nice shape , very portable , enough space for music , photos , contacts , etc  .
great ipod for beginers and for people who have alot of songs updated  .
on oct 18 , 2008  .
had the last generation shuffle , ipod classic (80gb model) , and now the nano 4g , plus have used my lg env cell phone for mp3s  .
any ipod is better than using my cell phone  .
i really like the size and capability of the nano  .
it is a toss    up between the ipod touch at $239 or the nano 8gb for $139  .
for the extra $100 what is i getting  .
i don't really need any of the fancier stuff on the touch , and it has the same storage at 8gb , so i went with the nano  .
the smaller size is definitely a plus for me  .
i've already got too much stuff to carry and like the fact this thing fits anywhere  .
the touch would become a device to me , which i do not need read a lot of comments on this site and i have to state that i like itunes  .
i've been using it since it came out  .
what i really like is that it tells me what popular songs for an artist i'm missing from my collection , plus offers similar styles of music from other artists  .
great way to surf and find other music .
this is the best nano yet  .
i think that apple listened to what people wanted with this one  .
the 3rd gen is to bulky for it to be a true nano  .
this one hits the mark  .
sound quality is the best  .
people have the opinion that ipods have poor sound quality  .
i have had many mp3 players nothing work with the ease that all ipods have  .
the 4th gen nano just take portability to the next level  .
cannot wait till the accesories get rollin out for this little gem  .
one last thing the shake to suffle music is just awsome  .
the game are pretty cool too  .
rock on  .
the best thing about this device is the thinness of it  .
every year they seem to get thinner and thinner maybe one day there will be a flexible ipod  .
think this is their best small ipod yet , with the accelerometer , this truly is very cool  .
i dont think any other mp3 player has the features of this  .
this really does beat the all  .
i will definitely buy one of these after i buy the new ipod touch .
my first and current mp3 player , this one great mp3 player if you like listening to music but are not that crazy about space and if you want a compact mp3 player that will fit anywhere and is lightweight not bulky and heavy and is beautifully designed out of an aluminum construction , just love it , i would definantly buy another one only thing apple should take note on take note is the bad battery life .
the ipod nano 4th gen is perfect for people who like entertainment on the go  .
the new features are a step up compared to its predecessor the nano 3rd gen , but the battery life needs some improvement .
guys , i'm being honest when i'm saying that the ipod nano 4g is the best mp3 player that i've ever owned  .
i'm no apple bias , i actually used to be an apple hater until i bought this device  .
breaking my creative zen (which is a great device aswell) , is not as detrimental as i thought , because the ipod nano fulfilled promisingly itunes first of all , kicks the living crap out of windows media player  .
the software is incredibly easy to use , and is not as glitchy as its microsoft contender  .
album art shows prominently on the now playing screen , which gives a unique look to it compared to other mp3 players  .
the user interface is very easy to use , and the accelerometer featured in the new nano is effective  .
browing through your music collection has never been so easy and fun to use  .
i is very impressed with the sound quality , even through the provided earbuds by apple  .
i find it quite rich , and the many eq's provided will fit your music tastes  .
the many colours apple offers makes choosing hard  .
i bought the orange which looks awesome ; has a more goldish look to it than orange  .
physically , the new nano is well built , sturdy and nice to hold , unlike the 3g fatty  .
the glossy screen finish denies sratches better aswell  .
it is very portable , and ideal for the gym if you work out apple did an expected great job  .
highly recomended .
the 4g is much better than the 3g , and costs much less than you'd expect for all the features included .
i'm on my third ipod , and let me just say    this is the best  .
i had the original shuffle    it broke  .
i had the nano 2g , but i ran out of space  .
my parents gave this to me for my birthday , and i have had very very little trouble with it  .
it took a little getting used to , with a smaller click wheel  .
the tilt sensor is also annoying , if you dropped it , it would consider it a 'shake' and shuffle your songs  .
however , with the first software update , they added a way to turn off the tilt sensor  .
problem    fixed  .
i've also had a little trouble holding a charge    it charges fast , but the backlight is much stronger than the old nano i used to have , so it is really draining it  .
i solved it by setting the backlight timer to 2 seconds , and that has really helped  .
the graphics for the games are fabulous , as well as the larger album artwork  .
the genius is great , when it works  .
i've found that some less popular songs    even when purchsed off the store    cannot be used in it  .
also , songs from burned cds cannot be used for it either , which is disappointing  .
i love the curved edges  .
at first , the hold switch sticks , but that's standard  .
i got it a week after it is released (i love being born in september  .
) and have had no unfixable problems  .
just mess around with your settings until it suits your needs  .
also     .
i'd reccomend getting a clear acrylic case to cover the screen , and also , have your name engraved on it    my friend's is stolen this is a fabulous product    just play with your settings until it is just how you need it .
i've owned mp3 players from various brands , from apple to creative through sony through samsung and even some cheaper one such as le    mon or aigo  .
i recently purchased the ipod nano as i needed to replace an old 4gb zen which is really beginning to die on me  .
at first , i is quite disappointed by the lack of the usual add    ons such as a radio , microphone for recording , etc then one day i is out jogging with it fell , and skidded for a few metres on gravel  .
needless to say , i is quite worried about dents and scratches when i went to retrieve it  .
much to my surprise , there was not even a scratch on the body , much less the screen  .
the video playback function is not too difficult to use , too , one you're used to hitting the menu key on your left/right  .
the review above didn't mention cover flow , so here it is  .
the ipod nano 4g has cover flow , and you can access it from anywhere in the main menu or music menu by simply flipping the ipod on its side  .
(you cannot do this in the settings menu , though ) battery life is pretty reasonable , if you can charge it every three or four days and don't overuse it  .
shake    to    shuffle is also a pretty snazzy function for folks like me out there who have every sort of music in their ipod and cannot decide what they wa not to listen to  .
for anyone who has an older generation nano and wants to upgrade , or is looking for a new mp3 player , i'd recommend this one .
i bought the touch and ended up sending it back in lieu of a nano  .
i like the nano much better  .
it is smaller , lighter , etc  .
it doesnt surf the web but my pda does that im no expert on sound quality , but i think its great  .
i love the games , and dropping a few movies on it is a lot of fun  .
it has a slim body , love the color silver with the black wheel  .
i wish that someone had written this for me before i had bought my new nano 4g  .
now , don't get me wrong it's pretty darn awesome now that i am done setting the thing up  .
i wish someone had been more upfont with me about the time involved in converting the hundreds of songs we already had on our windows xp computer stored in windows media player  .
i is concerned that this would be a problem , but never really saw anywhere that properly prepared me for this  .
so here it goes , for you guys who were in my boat of uncertainty  .
this device is definitely not a plug and play device  .
if you have a lot of music already on your computer , do not expect to be able to listen to your music immidiately upon plugging it into your computer like you would with many other mp3 players    the ipon doesn't work like that  .
i downloaded i    tune 8 which is very easy  .
i actually really like itunes  .
however , it is supposed to check your computer for songs already on it and begin converting them to the apple format  .
don't worry , when you convert , you still keep original formatting in windows media player (wmp)  .
well , 99  .
9% of my songs were not recognized  .
so , it took me an hour to figure out that you need to figure out exactly where on your computer your songs are stored  .
mine is in the c   drive under documents and owner , etc but you just have to search for a song by right clicking the start button and chosing search  .
then type the name of a song and wait until it finds it  .
once i finally figured it out , it was not hard  .
i started the manual converting which took a really really long time  .
seriously , it takes as long as it would take to burn new cds just so you know what to expect  .
then , once you get all the songs on you can search for album art  .
don't be surprised if it doesn't find them all  .
but you can go into wmp and select individaul albums and do drag and drop of files for the art  .
the directions for that are on itunes  .
finally , if you have songs that itunes says it cannot convert because they are copyright protected (ie you downloaded them from another source , in my case wal    mart) , you can still get them into itunes by first burning them to a blank cd then opening the cd up in itunes  .
worked like a charm  .
okay , that's really the worst of it  .
once that is done you are smooth sailing and the nano is super cool  .
we all really love it and i really do like itunes 8  .
i downloaded a couple of cool games (only $4  .
99 ea) and got my daughter the jonas brothers video for $1  .
49 which she loves  .
i will definitely use itunes for video downloads , etc but i don't know if i will buy music from it because of the proprietary format  .
especially now that i know how to download from another site and get around the copyright protection issue  .
i really like this player  .
we've only before had cheap ones that broke  .
i also love the playlists in this player so that as a family we can all have our music on it yet only listen to our own songs  .
don't let some of these reviews scare you off because once you get the conversion done , it's a piece of cake  .
and if you do not have a bunch of stuff to convert , even better i hope this saves you some time  .
i mulled over the purchase for several weeks being nervous from some of these reviews  .
i am glad i finally took the plunge .
in the end , this player kicks the crap out of the zune in all categories and is a super fun , super thin player that has tones of memory for videos and music and is a must buy for anyone that is in the market for a new player .
its ok , but if you compared this to the 5th generation , you may get slapped about a 100 times .
i love this thing  .
updated  .
on aug 25 , 2009  .
this is an almost    perfect mp3 player    it's very portable and pocket    friendly , and can play music , video , podcasts , and games  .
there are a few glitches , even with the latest firmware , that causes me to have to reset my ipod  .
i personally watch a good number of video podcasts in addition to having almost 7 gigs of music , so i wish it would have more storage space (i guess that's what the 16gb model is for)  .
i am also a fan of listening to fm radio , so i also wish it had a built    in fm tuner like the zune  .
overall it's a great player , but if you watch a lot of video and have a lot of music to put on it , then you probably want to get the 16gb model .
also , the learning curve from someone that comes from microsoft to apple is steep  .
this is my first apple product ever , and it took me a week to figure out all the conversion steps  .
it has what i would say pretty good sound quality  .
the games are cool , shake sucks , i do not recomend that you try to put in long videos because it get irratateing to have to look at a small screen for so long .
the factor in choosing this ipod is the portability combined with the features  .
i have too much music for a 120 gig plus the fact that i want to have a small light    weight device is a simple choice  .
no need to upload my entire library of music  .
i like the shuffle feature combines with the new screen  .
this has come a long way since my old 4 gig 1st gen  .
i also received the traditional 10% off by recycling my old ipod at the store  .
the service , as usual , is sub    par  .
i had to wait 20 minutes to buy my ipod while 1 sales person is trying to hit on a girl while the others were just pretending to be busy  .
8 people in the store , 6 customers  .
20 minutes  .
no one knew what they were talking about  .
does this apply to most mac stores  .
only wish is that apple would stop tying to rule the music market by freeing up their grasp on the music realm  .
there are so many problems with this its hard to tackle  .
you payed for years , music in 128kbs quality for the price of a cd  .
you bought a digital download for the same amount as a hard copy of a cd that sounds worse and is cheaper to produce  .
taking advantage  .
drm free  .
no flac  .
this is a music player not a pop iconic art  .
i want things that work like my mac pro when i need to due my graphic art on illustrator  .
i want the best audio quality reproduction , and in the realm on digital music , it can be had with just implementing a codec into the software  .
seems so simple  .
too much about the money and not about the consumer i do agree , that despite the minor software aspect , the device is simple the best on the market for what it does .
what sold me to this ipod is its attractive design , i think it's just plain beautiful the one    piece , aluminum body gives it a bit more external resilience , and it reminds me of the unibody  .
i also like the curve   )  .
it is pretty thin and it has 9 colors to choose from (personally , the black one is my favorite) it has some pretty nice features       cover flow , though i don't really see anyone using it a lot ; shake    to    shuffle , in    case you want a bit of randomness ; and genius on the go the built    in accelerometer gives you a whole new way of playing the games  .
like , for example , you have to physically tilt the ipod to steer in a racing game games , movies/videos , and photos look just amazing on the screen  .
very sharp , i definitely see myself watch a full    length movie on this ipod , despite small the screen size battery life is disappointing (in my opinion) ; i feel like it drains too fast , even though i have the ipod on the most energy    efficient settings  .
apple say it'll play audio for up to 24 hours , but that's when the battery has just come of off manufacturing  .
by the time you buy it , a great amount of time would've definitely passed since the manufacturing of the battery , allowing it to age and lose capacity you need itunes 8 and its boat    load of system requirements , that alone may steer you clear of this product if you do not have enough resources  .
just make sure to try out itunes 8 before buying the ipod and for all of this , i would've liked the price to be a bit lower , especially with the battery life it brings  .
at the very least they doubled the capacity from last gen another amazing product from apple , but it's definitely not perfect .
in conclusion , a fantastic upgrade from my previous ipod nano , the bright screen and slim new casing on the body are attractive , although the click wheel should have a sensitivity setting .
updated  .
on sep 19 , 2008  .
for $149 for the 8gig model , its a great bargin  .
nice player , reasonably easy to use  .
i started it up , and expected it to contain a sample piece of music or video , but it doesn't have anything already loaded out of the box  .
so it seemed , i had to download itunes , load up my entire collection of music just to download a song on to it to see if it worked  .
i'm sure i could have just moved a file over via the windows file system or used my trusty mediamonkey , but i wanted to treat it as a novice would  .
i don't like the in ear phones , so rather than try those i used my own sennheisers  .
the socket on the nano is a standard 3  .
5mm jack , so no problem there  .
having installed itunes , i connected the nano to my laptop using the supplied usb cable  .
itunes recognised it immediately but it was not obvious how to get a song on to it  .
if you click on the ipod icon itunes tries to get you to sign up to the itunes site which i didn't want to do  .
finally i just used drag and drop which worked fine the sound is okay , but nothing to write home about  .
the album art works nicely , with the rotate , although the screen is not very big  .
i cannot imagine wanting to watch much video on it , i'd sooner have a more basic screen and longer battery life  .
too early to say how long the battery will last  .
shaking to shuffle works , but a simple button would be easier  .
this just seems like a cheap gimick to me  .
the click wheel works , but is a little sensitive  .
older folk might find it hard to use the only problem then is how to turn it off  .
you'd think it would be an option on the menu , but no you have to hold down the play button  .
why  .
finally the new nano fitted in to the speaker set i'd purchased (intempo ids) using the adaptor for a 3rd gen nano  .
i'm sure specific versions for the new nano will be out soon enough , but i could not wait .
i would prefer volume up    down keys separate from the click wheel  .
i would prefer to use up , down , left , right motions on the wheel rather than spinning around the wheel  .
i generally find the click wheel design odd and hard to use .
it's a slim , light , pocket    friendly gadget that offers a great music player , good    looking video playback , but needs the addition of games and more features  .
still , the ipod nano is a slick little device .
do not get me wrong  .
the 4g ipod nano is excellent  .
but i feel as though it is a mini refresh of the 3g model  .
i actually prefer my 3g nano  .
all of the new features on the 4g nano are cool , but you learn to hate them over time  .
when you run , the shake to shuffle feature always activates itself and shuffles your songs  .
when your ipod is in your pocket , it rotates to coverflow , meaning you cannot change the volume unless you take it out of your pocket  .
the screen also appears to be of lesser quality  .
do not upgrade to this unless you absolutely need a new ipod because you broke your old one or something of the like .
its a huge improvement  .
its nicer then the other ones but now i have to get something other than my computer to charge it .
over all i think that it is an improvement over the old nano for the good  .
there is no need to go out and buy it if you have the 3g otherwise if you have any of the older nanos i think it is time for an upgrade  .
the new elongated body will make some happy if they preferred the older nano style over the fatty but i am neutral on style i like the square body , and i don't mind the rectangular body either  .
with the accelerometer built in you can now tilt the screen on the main menu or while listening to something and get cover flow to pop right up which is very nice  .
also while your watching a video you are forced to turn the nano on its side to watch something , but you can turn it on either side and it will flip the video upright to the side that you turned it on  .
the new shake to shuffle is good if your just wanting to turn some music on quickly or your just lazy like me and don't want to scroll through the main menu to find a song to listen to , you really don't have to shake the nano that hard i found and it has not gone to the next track on me when i did not want it to  .
i also cant wait to see if they make anymore games for the nano that use the accelerometer  .
alas i am happy they doubled the gigs for the same price and it is a very good mp3 player but there is still room for improvements  .
thanks for reading  .
ok so i have had a zune 4 gig for the past year and i decided to switch to the new nano  .
i loved how they offer so many vibrant colors  .
its so thin and teh curved design gives it an even thinner look  .
i actaully think the audio quility is pretty good it sounds better than what the zune sounded with stock head phones  .
the display is much brighter then my zune  .
i love how the text is just the perfect size and theres even an option to make it bigger  .
on the down side the hold switch its pretty hard and you really have to try to put it on hold  .
the click wheel is a litttle hard to use since it will go pass were i want to go and have to keep going back and forth to choose the right thing  .
the new shake to shuffle is a bit senstive i is using it and dropped it on my bed it is just a 4 in  .
drop onto my bed and it enable the shuffle also i do not like how when ever you do the shuffle it redoes the music playlist so the new song is number one and you cannot go back to what you had been listening to  .
i like that it has eq settings but it would be better if you could just go over each setting and itgive you a preview of who it sounds instead of having to choose it to hear the difference than go back to see how the other ones sound  .
all in all the product could have been cheaper  .
but high costs is understandable as apple is not manufacturing the product in india and there are so very less apple outlets (almost none) features are very good and the design is quite better than the previous versions of nano apple should set up their outlets and try to make their products cheaper in indian markets i'm though no die hard fan of apple products but it just so happened that i bought it  .
now i realize it would have been better buying off a good mobile of same range .
at first i thought it is my headphones or my cable to connect to my car stereo , but after replacing them i found that anytime you move the ipod or the headphone cable it gets static and sometimes acts as if you unplugged the headphones and auto    pauses .
i knew of the torture of itunes but i decided to get an ipod anyway  .
looks and feels nice , but the sound quality really leaves something to be desired  .
and the battery life is nowhere near as high as it's claimed to be , i'm lucky to get 5 hours of music out of it , and i'd hate to think about video  .
the battery meter is also erratic , it can go down to barely anything then just jump back up to half    full for no reason fix the battery and sound quality and drop itunes and i'll come back for more  .
until then , back to my psp .
it is a decent piece of equipment but it really is not anything different better than a lot of other units out there and the worst issue is that i still have to deal with itunes , which really stinks and is a hog in resources  .
the thinnes makes it a nice product to handle and look at but that may also make it easier to damage  .
i have owned the hhd ipods and they dissapointed with the fact that they didn't last long considering the price  .
here is hoping that this one last longer or it will be the last ipod i purchase  .
they are essentially good looking products that have not been very reliable , or at least with my past ipods  .
this is purchased for my kid and not for my own use , but i took time to review it to see what the hype is all about .
apple is quickly becoming the crazy chick who's too hot to dump  .
the software is choppy and obnoxious , they actually took trouble to make sure that the new chromatic is not compatible (charging    wise) with the old bose sound dock , but it's soooo pretttyyyy apple is all about showmanship , but when it comes to software quality , which is to say it takes 7 hours to download and set up the newest version of itunes , which comes out just as you're getting used to the other one , it fails  .
why the hell should a person have to buy a new speaker system when they get a new ipod  .
it's bull there are some good things about this thing , and if you have a brand    new shiney sound system , by all means get it .
i have got to hand it to apple to create a product so popular and always brings in reliable sales especially during the holiday shopping season  .
but the only thing that changes is the design  .
nothing else does  .
of course you can argue that the accelerometer and the genius playlist are good additions but that cannot mask its mediocre audio quality and boring interface  .
i have a sony walkman which has a much larger screen , just as slick a design , and audio quality that completely crushes the nano  .
paired with my shure se110 it is heaven  .
that is what apple keeps on missing out on  .
what the ipod is originally meant for  .
to play music  .
if it cannot do that well then it pretty much is not worth buying  .
and i have had other apple products particularly the mini , nano 1g , and the video  .
none of them can stack up to my walkman  .
although i would prefer more space  .
which is why i'm going for the zune this year and not the ipod .
itunes 8 bsod on vista look at apple discussions a big problem is there a problem at apple how could a mistake get by testing       do they test  .
if you're young this is the gadget to wish for sleek , classy and really portable  .
hail 2g ipod nano  .
cannot find any car chargers that will charge it  .
i have a charger/fm broadcaster that worked on the old nano , but won't charge the new one  .
it often shuffles suddenly without intending to  .
if its in your pocket and you want to turn the volume down , you have to take it out and make sure its pointed the right way  .
there are enough annoyances that upgrading is not worth it  .
there's really nothing in the new one that you do not have in the old one except a few bells and whistles that end up being annoying .
no firewire charging feature on this nano made it unacceptable to me  .
i is not willing to change the wiring in my car or replace my radio for one that will charge this gen 4 nanp while it is being used  .
looks like apple is trying to squeeze more money out of their customers by removing this feature .
i need an i    pod which has at least  .
160gb storage but which also has recording capability  .
i do not like any of the existing i    pods or zunes  .
there is also no need for i    tunes which is interested solely in selling music .
i do not know what they were thinking about   )  .
apple , as usual , exists in a world of its own  .
the 4th gen nano has dropped support for firewire , so many ipod ready chargers that worked with 3rd gen ipods will no longer work  .
also , apple has updated the api or something (hence the itunes 8 requirement) for this nano , and therefore many stereo systems and car decks will no longer control the ipod    expect to see comm err if you buy this  .
as long as your completely apple in all your hardware , you're probably safe , but if you have any real a/v components , expect them to be left behind by apple products i , for one , will not buy a new stereo to use this device    i returned mine for a refund .
most of you little ipod twits are too young to remember the first generation ipod's that were made in america by apple (that is when an american company)  .
i had my first one for over 5 years and it never let me down until the battery went dead those were rugged , american made , dependable machines that worked properly as advertised and never let you down  .
yes it is bigger and had less capacity but it worked right and is made by americans that spent their paycheck in america  .
you will be lucky if you get a chinese made ipod that works right and last more than a year  .
more chinese crap at it's finest  .
i am extremely dissappointed in the apple company  .
i thought for a while that apple is dependable and always reliable (unlike the last guy that i dated)  .
i'm probably going to buy a new ipod from apple itself in case best buy just got a bad shipment  .
and then i'll test the battery life again  .
as fun as the nano is the battery life is most important .
want to know how to turn an otherwise 5    star product into something barely usable  .
ask apple about the new nano  .
every  .
mp3 player in the world should have a couple of basic features , such as volume control and skipping forward and backward through songs  .
one would think , none would be designed without them  .
but apple amazingly has found a way  .
turn the new nano on its side (apple , read   runners , or anyone working out , rarely carry their  .
mp3 players in a perfect 90 degrees to horizon orientation) and , voila , you can no longer control the thing  .
instead of being able to preserve your eardrums by quickly dialing back volume when your shuffle function kicks you from something quiet to something loud , you're presented with the ability to jump from one album art cover to another  .
woohoo  .
apple , read this   someone is going to get hurt behind the wheel while driving and trying to undo the cover flow feature  .
this is sooo foreseeable that your corporate counsel should be dictating a fix to product development as we speak prospective buyers , do not buy the nano until apple releases a fix for this ridiculous mess , especially if you foresee a need to control volume or want to skip back/ahead through your music without having to stop whatever you're doing , turn nano upright , look at the nano screen and wait for it to return to normal  .
mp3 player functionality  .
duh  .
unfortunately these reviews are from people who are picking it up , twirling the scroll wheel for 5 minutes , and then tapping out spiffy reviews  .
actual users have discovered a deal breaker flaw with the new nano 4g   for those that wear it on a belt , hold it in their hands while walking and exercising , the coverflow feature auto    activates when the nano is tipped horizontally , thus preventing any access to the volume or navigation controls until you reorientate it in a vertical position  .
that means no casual adjustments to volume or songs while your nano is in your pocket , on your belt , or in your hand while exercising  .
literally hundreds of actual nano 4g owners have submitted complaints to apple discussion boards on the apple website and to apple directly about this very issue  .
hopefully apple will listen and release a software update to provide an option to disable the useless and intrusive coverflow screen , but apple is notorious for not listening to its user base  .
thus , my nano 4g is useless , and it's heading back to amazon  .

i got mine ipod for my birthday in june 2009 6 monthes later it would not turn on  .
so i had to get a new one  .
my first one i hade never droped it or any thing  .
mine 2nd one is haveing thnat problem now to and its only been 4 monthes  .
i would not recommened this ipod .
the sound on this ipod is absolutely terrible , i have some solo hds that sound like they are supposed to in my older ipod nano , but they sound terrible in this new ipod  .
i dont know if they switched the sound chip or what , but i am very upset at the sound quailty of this device  .
i am going to take it back asap and switch to another brand or just stay with my old one  .
if you want a great sounding ipod , dont buy this ipod  .
very disappointed  .
it seemed to work , but when i followed the instructions and ejected the device for use  .
all the songs that it showed on the computer were not on the device  .
so much for plug and play  .
not sure i will buy another apple product .
waste of money  .
very very disapointed , dont buy it , stick with your old ipod or mp3 player  .
in my opinion the new ipod nano is totally useless for those who play their music on docking ports as the new ipod can not be charged without returning to your pc every couple of hours  .
unlike the older ipod wiich are able to charge as they sit on the docking ports the new ipod will not  .
why oh why would ipod do this  .
i is so looking forward to my new ipod and is so disapointed when i had to return it , as every time i went to use it on any of my three different docking ports it is drained of power , even my 600 dollar ipod juke box wont charge this devise and i would have to go back to my pc to charge it again apple should be ashamed of them selves for what they did to this new product .
purchased nano for $150 upgraded from a former ipod which we spent $200 for pioneer car stereo interface that contains a built in firewire charger  .
also spent for $50 apiece two firewire docks along with $30 for a firewire wall plugin converter  .
greedy jerks apple decided that firewire chargers are no longer supported for new ipods  .
that means we had to spend $50 apiece again for the all new wonder dock called the universal dock  .
woweeee  .
feeling good now  .
that piece of crap does not come with a wall plug in unit  .
so had to spend another 30$ on a usb plug in converter  .
so now instead of a $150 present for my family i am in for $230  .
you are the scum of the earth you greedy jerks  .
shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame on you  .
you are greedy filth  .
you are worse than m$ and that is about the worse insult i can make besides spitting directly in your face .
it suks 3rd gen is better  .
tha ipod nano4g is a downgrade from the 3g one  .
the 3g fit in my wallet and i loved the shiny back  .
the 4g just looks like plastic  .
i is really disappointed when i got it  .
its also very slow and the shake to shuffle function is much too sensitive if you want an ipod nano get the 3g one , bevore it is too late  .
do not buy it for reasons above more specifically , a griffin car adapter , built in bmw charger and altec lansing in motion speaker system will not recharge ipod battery  .
so if you make the mistake of buying this product be prepared for a lot of additional expense apple technician's response is too bad , its your problem  .
to add insult to injury , apple charges a 10% fee (restocking)for returning this defective item .
apple needs to make the sound better  .
cnet even says its just average so how can they justify giving this ugly device an 8  .
what's the point of a 2 screen  .
eliminate it .
Sleek &#38; Thin. Excellent Music Quality. Great UI, Well Designed In Every Aspect. Excellent Syncing, Everything Is Well Though Out. Quality Build; Shake To Shuffle Feature Is More Annoying Everyday. Rotate To Coverflow Is More Annoying Everyday. Screen Seems To Be Downgraded From 3G iPod
Cover Flow, Shake to Shuffle, Genius Playlist; Earphones quality
Shape is okay; Terrible sound. Incompatible with old charging accessories.
none really; sounds average. too big. no need for a screen
Videos, Podcasts, Music, and Games!; Battery life..........work on it Apple!
Light weight, slim, thats about it; Got it home, took it out of the box, hooked it up.
Excellent U.I., attractive look, feasability, iTunes, features, quality; FM Radio is the sole lacking, but rather unecessary anyways.
New design, very light, amazingly bright, great music quality, easy to use, awesome accelrometer; Sometimes hard to use scroll wheel while doing things
every song will be on the screen; rhe built in speaker,
i hate this verson 3rd gen is the way better then this; screen size
Easy to learn and use; Doesn't play all types of files
Accelerometer, genius, 2.0 inch screen; I wanted it to be touch screen
light, slim and familiar; incompatible with a lot of older hardware
--nice slim design--2 inch Lcd display--new and improved features--; --battery life is dissapointing when used at full potential--cover flow becomes a hassle when enabled--screen creates a glare--
Light, slim design, adds an accelerometer, mostly responsive click-wheel, displays album art, cover flow is cool, videos look nice.; Small screen, no online store, not many games, games don't look too good, could use more features.
- Thin. - Nine colors. - Accelerometer. - Sharp, "big" two-inch display. - One-piece, all-aluminum body. - Features -- "Cover Flow," "Shake-to-shuffle," and "Genius". - Extras -- an alarm, clock, and stopwatch; view your calendars, contacts, and notes; - Battery life. - Requires iTunes 8. - A bit on the expensive side
sleek non-scratchable aluminum design,acceleromter,Cheapish, bright screen, text-to-speech function, assorted colors; still no FM radio, shorter battery life compared to last years nano, click wheel seems harder to use than last years model for some reason
Colorful, tilt sensor, cool games, a lot of music, crispy screen, little, good sound quality and...everything!!; nothing in cons
lightweight, great design, good sound, good value; COVER FLOW! Apple's marketing materials for the new Nano should include the following bullet point: "- new Cover Flow feature DISABLES volume and navigation controls automatically!"
Nice screen, good sound, feels nice in hand.; Coverflow feature is miserable...it prevents access to volume &#38; nav controls. 4 STAR DEDUCTION FOR SUCH A BRAIN-DEAD LAPSE OF COMMON SENSE BY APPLE.
Vibrant colors. Slim design. Nice looking screen. Price is hard to beat. Decent amount of features; Sound quality is poor. Useless features. Still no FM radio. Interface is tiring. No customization
Small, innovative, sexy, and lightweight design. Good sound production and bright,clear, and colorful screen. Menu is fast and good with the features.; No FLAC audio still? Some limitations
great colors!!! light weight, good shape, screen is big, good quality for videos; click wheel is way to hard to use
It's prettty, nice screen, fabulous graphics, clever little effects, good sound quality.; Not much that's new, won't charge on Bose SoundDock 1. iTunes makes everything a pain in the ass.
Compact, light weight, shake to suffle, fast responce, up to 16gb of music, want more can I say; Not enough accesories yet because it is so new!! Hope that will change.
Allows graphics, videos, contacts and other information beyond just music to be stored and synced through iTunes.. Super-small yet allows good control and navigation.. An 8gb model cost only $139 at Sams Club, not badly priced.; Would rather have an OFF button that does just that. Anytime I'm connected through iTunes to my laptop it does wierd things and likes to stay on.
Can take my music ANYWHERE. descent sound quality.; The headphone jack shorts out. The shake-to-shuffle feature is a horrible idea unless you never move when you listen to music. DUMB DUMB DUMB IDEA, APPLE!! Certain headphone plugs are too big to simultaneously charge and listen.
price, looks, and how easy it is to use! this is my first iPod ever (i got black, not silver).; no cons yet. its kind of tiny, though.
Looks nice, feels good, impressive features; Terrible sound quality - really not what I expected from an iPod, battery life is quoted at 24 hours but I'm lucky to get 5 or 6! And of course, iTunes.
The screen is bigger and you can now play videos on it.; You can't charge it in your old docking stations like memorex imove boombox. it keeps saying that it is not compatible.
screen size, return to silmer design, aluminum wrapped- no more laquer back, space, tilt sensitive, price; smaller click wheel takes a little getting used to, the tilt sensor gets annoying, genius doesn't work for all songs off iTunes
cheaper than the older model; curved glass, fingerprints on the screen, terrible sound quality, shake to shuffle starts all the time, when i walk, new menu design is ugly
Good sound clarity and volume levels.. Great video clarity.. Easy to operate.. Easy handling.; Too much expensive.. Not bundled with radio.. No bundled case with the player.. Battery runs out quite quickly.. While playing games(even when the battery is full) the bar showing battery enters the red region i.e. low battery signal.
NOTHING GOOD ABOUT PRODUCT; Doesn't charge in anything but the cpu or the wall with a wall adaptor for another $30. I just bought a new car with IPOD hook up in the call the piece of garbage IPod doesn't play, but my fiance's more expensive ipod does work. This product stinks.
with the new shake to shuffle and the accelerometer built in, why would you not want this?; i would like to see the itunes wifi music store on the nano soon
Small and it works some times; Shuts down unexpectedly sometimes. One computer to work properly. Must be reset often to sync with computer. Does not recognise all imports, legal or not. Batteries can't be replaced. When dead, you through it away and spend hundreds for a new one.
Great design and great graphics along with good quality sound. Pretty new metallic design; Only average battery life. headphones are a little uncomfortable. Hard to see in light
Thin and compact design. 8 and 16 gigs. Great sweet colors. Shake to shuffle. Pretty nice display; Sound quality is really bad. Doesn't work with my charger. Click wheel doesn't work very well. 2g ipod nano's better, in audio quality and design
Interface is still familiar, still like the extras included in the device. Thinnes makes it nice to look at. Color selection is better than in the past.; I still have to deal with iTunes, There really isn't anything new or ground breaking. Thinnes may make it easier to damage
Light weight. Good music quality. Accelerometer is fun. Video quality is great!; If it's too cold, the click wheel doesn't work right. A pain to restart if it freezes. Screen will scratch way too easily. To edit, you MUST use iTunes *like this for all iPods*
Lots of features, very thin and pocket-friendly, has an accelerometer for games, coverflow, and shake-to-shuffle; For someone who watches lots of video and/or video podcasts it could use more storage space, a few minor glitches even with the latest firmware, not the best sound quality, no FM tuner
ease of use,perfect material aluminum combined with glass it's like it's made in Italy; it has a perfect interface but we bought music players to listen to music.If apple could make partners with bang and olufsen with their ice power digital amplifier circuitry,then i-pod would be the King of music players!
Great design, thinner to carry, very simililar to a PDA, and the podcasts and videos is great.; The amounts of space that it takes to create a library with all the features is insane!
this is one of the best music players ive ever used. itunes works fine, no matter what people say, the shape is good, the sound is good, its a great product.; the screen gets a bit of glare, but not that much, and the headphones with mic are $30.
amazingly thin. great colors. i think the audio quilty is pretty good. nice bright display with nice sized font; hold switch is just to stiff. the click wheel can be a bit hard to use at times. the new shake to shuffle is a little too sensitive. the eq setting could be better
Its small, sleek, looks great. Sound is good and video looks good.; Can't find any car chargers that will charge it. It often shuffles suddenly without intending to. If its in your pocket and you want to turn the volume down, you have to take it out and make sure its pointed the right way.
...can't beat the build quality.. ...sound quality is great, at least for me. I'm sure you'll find "purist's" that will take issue.. ...video quality is Superb, the small screen in no way diminishes the quality of the picture.; ....I don't care for the earbuds, but not just Apple's. My wife loves 'em (yes, I had to buy 2 iPod Nano's....lucky me).
Super thin, barely exists in the 3rd dimension. Great screen, images are crisp and beautiful. Feels great in the hand. iTunes 8 works fine. Full metal design resists scratching; Click wheel is a little small, but thats how it always has been for the nanos. Not a huge upgrade from the 3G but anything older than that is a great upgrade
Reasonably easy to use. Looks nice.; I don't like iTunes, too much emphasis on selling me music. I already have a collection and don't want to buy from iTunes. Its not obvious how to turn it off. Not sure if the anodised aluminium (green in my case) won't scratch easily
nice looking - small and light; if your car is wired for an older ipod or stereo the connector will not charge this Gen 4 Nano while it is being used. You will need to take it out and charge it daily. I took this NANO back for a refund.
the video veiwing is pretty good. the sound quality is also good.; I bought a nano after being fed up with a sansa mp3 player.I was unhappy to find that the battery power was not lasting as long as it should. I returned the 1st and exchanged it 4 a 2nd. but the second also had problems with the battery.
the software within the new nano is simply awesome, and if you cant handle the non-backwards compatible accessories (i have to buy new charger), then dont buy it. simple as that. stop complaining!; yeah, the non-backwards compatible software is a downer, but it's nothing new. every piece of software equipment has this same problem. the new software included with the new ipod is reason enough to ignore its (small) downfalls
Great design. Bright, colorful design. Easy to learn the controls. Itunes is very easy to use. Kid friendly. Sounds great. Separate playlists for family members. Would have been 5 stars except for conversion issues-see below.; No in-box directions other than super basic. Takes a long time to convert songs already on your computer not purchased in itunes (such as in Windows Media Player) with poor directions on how to do it. Online directions are tricky to navigate.
I had the previous pink iPod Nano and I found the screen too small, but on the new iPod nano, I found the screen to be big, bright and easy to look at. I found the tilt/shake features on the iPod as a good addition, but not necessary.; Thought the click wheel could have a sensitivity setting (going from slow-fast).
first of all,i have a blue one, and i love the color!!!! :] the cover flow is cool, because the screen goes vertically and horizontally. the size is great too!!! :]; the shake to shuffle got annoying so i had to turn it off, and i had to restart my ipod a few times, but other than a few minor issues, there were no problems!! :]
Excellent interface, USB connection is faster than most other MP3 players, cos of the plug (which is quite wide), light, durable, small, screen is clear and pretty resilient to scratches. Cover flow is also a cool function to have.; Click wheel is uncomfortable to use if your fingers are almost completely dry, as friction tends to get in the way. No microphone or radio, as most MP3 players have these days. Having to use iTunes is a drawback too.
although the new nano wont charge on any ipod dock you own, it can only be charged on your computer, the docks will plays music but just drains the ipod until it is dead, however it does come in some pretty colors.; I bought one and took it back, ipod deliberatly removed the ability to charge your devise on the docking ports you already own. Therefore althought the docks will play your new ipod you must return to your pc to recharge them after just a few hours.
When I hold this iPod i fell like it was made for me. it just feel so natural in your hand. The games on the Nano are also pretty entertaining. So that on those long road trips if just listening to your favorite song just start playing.; The Shake on your Nano is pretty useless i would say as if you were playing a prank on your friend you have to keep shaking the can until it works. what i'm saying is is that it feels like you need to shake it hard and you feel like you'll brake it
Fast response, video capability, good sound. 8G of memory provides for a large music library and days of podcasts, including video podcasts, with space left over for using it as a USB memory stick.; I don't like the user interface of the ipod (click wheel) nor iTunes. The curved glass on the screen is a mistake and will have too many reflection issues. A 2G design with a flat face on the whole ipod makes more sense to me. I own a 2g Nano.
The new accelerometer is very fun because it gets incorporated into a new game that is preloaded on the Nano, it is a maze game and you have to tilt the Nano to move the ball very fun! Cover flow runs much more smoothly than the 3g Nano.; The curved screen gets just a little glare but not enough to make a big deal out of it. The battery life is not as good which is disappointing. I also feel like the screen is a finger print magnet.
