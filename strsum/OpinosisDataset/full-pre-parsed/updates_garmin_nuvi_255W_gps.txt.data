another thing to consider was that i paid $50 less for the 750 and it came with the fm transmitter cable and a usb cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads .

 update and reroute much _more_ quickly than my other gps   .

update on this ,  it finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .

 it's a curiousity for most of us, traffic and content updates   .

the text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the garmin put out for the 255w the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .

,  speed of map updates is awesome .

 i first bought it from another site that was cheaper by $25 and they told me that i needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .

 another big name site did the same thing and told me that i would have to pay garmin to update to the latest maps .

 the navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as i have seen in other models .

finally, be carefull around washington dc, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .

 this clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .

 upon plugging my nuvi 255w in the pc for the first time, it immediately informed me of both a software update and a map update .

 the map update  are free for the first 60 days after registering .

 the map update was about 2gb in size .

 i have comcast cable internet and a quad, core pc with 4gb of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install .

 if you don't have a fast internet connection the update will take some time .

i have held off from getting any gps unit for a long time because i have a book of maps for the united states and i have always been able to update the travel  atlas  and supplement that with free maps from the internet via google, yahoo, etc .

_________________________ update__________________________

 with the tomtom, if you update to the newest map firmware you get everything the garmin 765 has minus the traffic .

 and it is $79 a year to update the maps .

 however, the points of interests are substandard, it would not pick up restuarants that we know have been there >3 yrs, and that was after we updated the maps, which was a 3 hr download .

> with your savings, you can buy lifetime map updates from the garmin web site for $119 !

> links up flawlessly to my mac using garmin roadtrip, webupdates, etc .

 i ran the updater and there was an upgrade for the software and text for jack tts and samantha tts .

 today, i checked the web updater again and their was a second update for jack tts and samantha tts .

 very disappointing that the product does not come with a standard power cable or even a usb cable ,  especially considering that is what you must have to use for software updates and product registration .

 then it said i needed to update some software i said ok .

5 it came with the latest maps  garmin city navigator nt north america 2009  and i didn't have to update it .

the maps seem to be fairly updated .

 i found too many users who said that the traffic update feature   is not all that dependable a feature .

i found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after i updated them from garmin's website everything is golden .

 otherwise you can't update the maps !

 also make sure you update the unit software from the garmin website on a regular basis .

 use the  webupdater  so that the unit is running at its peak .

 i avoided the more complex ones as i had read that fm updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .

 it can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .

i updated to the latest 2010 map soon after i received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .

 i also like the way that it connects to the internet   to update all of its maps .

 all i can really say about this, is update the firm ware straight out of the box, and when the gps shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .

 i also like the fact that garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other gps manufacturers .

once you have the unit, you'll want to update the maps .

 once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .

 one guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .

 directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .

 i discovered that i need it while trying to register the device and or to get updated maps at the garmin website .

 more often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .

map update ,  when you register it on, line   you get an offer for one free map update .

 i plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .

 by the time it needs a new update the unit will be obsolete .

 mapsource also makes it easy to update your unit's map annually .

 i have no need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point a to point b as i get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .

 the only nitpick disappointment was when i downloaded the free 2010 map update it dosn't show road extensions completed a few years ago .

 getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .

 easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .

,  also very quick and i mean quick reroute when you miss a turn plus smooth update position when moving, not choppy on the screen .

,  updating the gps took way to long and i have dsl ,  4 hours to download a 2gb map update and 3 hours to install the program to the gps .

 i read that some mac user could not get it to update at all .

,  no traffic update but don't really need it

 we started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot c330 which was a dream .

 the sound isn't that bad, just make sure you get your free map update from the garmin site within the 60 day time period .

 not so ,  tried the garmin web site for an updated map and was told by garmin that none was available .

 loading a map update is another experience i won't go into .

 haven't driven with it yet since the update but it seems crisp and with more detail .

 glad i updated the map and software .

 since the update , drove it locally in san diego and it worked fabulously .

 in a  test  the day i received the unit, before map updates, i was directed to exit the freeway many miles before it made sense .
