the staff was very friendly and helpful , arranging for a cab to the airport early the next morning , giving us directions to restaurants , arranging for a very nice box breakfast as we had to leave before breakfast service .
we walked though the underground maze of shops to the taipei bus terminal a , which was a bit confusing as there is an east and west terminal .
the bus cost twd 34 ( around $ 1 us ) as we are over 65 , other wise it would have cost twd 68 ( $ 2 us ) .
we took the kuokuang bus # 1816 to taoyuan ( not taoyuan airport ) and got off at the shuangfeng intersection stop .
to get to the air port we took a cab ( arranged by the hotel ) and we paid twd 530 ( $ 17 .
to get to the hotel from down town taipei , we took the subway to taipei main station ( twd 20 ) ( $ 0 .
we had a very unique room , which was like sleeping in a glass bowl , with glass on 3 sides , with a wonderful view of the river and sky line .
the hotel is not in the middle of nowhere , within a five or ten minute walk there are supermarkets , department stores and all kinds of restaurants , some cheap , some very expensive .
we decided to stay here , as it was much closer to the airport for an early morning flight , than the hotel we were staying in , in taipei .
the bus has a sign in english and chinese above the driver , and announces in chinese and english each stop .
