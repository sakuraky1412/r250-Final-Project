my maxtor onetouch 160g works as advertised  .
easy onetouch incremental duplication , and automatic incremental backup are very nice , and work well here are my own tips as a token of appreciation for cnet public service to users (i'm quite a newbie , don't take this as a too serious piece of advice)  .
1) first the maxtor unit configuration has to be done following step by step the useful paper manual  .
i read it all and found a lot of useful information there  .
2) quit skype , google desktop and some resident protection software can be a good idea before big back ups  .
3) don't move the drive during use  .
4) always quit your maxtor with the safe remove utility from xp  .
5) do not overuse the unit , so that it does not get exceedingly warm  .
5) always use a stabilized power supply (stabilizer) so that the electric power has not micro cuts  .
6) when not in use it is a good idea to keep the maxtor unit switched off to save its inernal parts  .
7) generally keep the unit in possibly a rather fresh and well ventilated area  .
on the rear side of the unit there are some cooling holes which should have enough space for air flow  .
8) use defrag from time to time for your computer as well as for your maxtor external drive (although it is quite long)  .
9) do not relie exclusively on your maxtor external drive to save your data  .
it can be used best as back up for your computer data , but your data should be stored or preserved in two different places at least    your computer hard disk and your maxtor external drive for instance  .
so in case of a computer crash or external disk drive crash , one set of your data remains intact  .
10) if you can have norton ghost it is also a good idea to also back up your data on your maxtor external drive using ghost  .
the advantage of ghost is that recovery can be a bit more simple to implement  .
partition , windows and service packs do not have to be reinstalled first with ghost after the crash , although it is the case with the retrospect express software provided with the one touch line of products  .
11) after several years please accept that your external disk drive might be a bit worn out , and prepare to buy a new one .
i have had this drive for over a year and it has been very reliable  .
i purchased a camera case for traveling and the power source requirement is sometimes a pain  .
what i like best is that i do not have to carry my notebook computer wherever i go and/or i can plug into any computer to transfer files .
i've had this drive for almost 2 years and haven't had any problems with it  .
the only thing i haven't like is the one    touch backup software  .
it seems like it takes longer to get this running correctly than it is to just drag and drop what i need backed up  .
i realize that does not work for everyone .
i purchased the drive in july of 2003 and immediately noticed the heat build up on the top of the case when using it for a short period  .
i measured the temp and it does reach the high 80's       low 90's  .
way too hot  .
this compares to the dell dimension pc operating in 60's  .
at the time i called maxtor questioning why this unit had no cooling fan       it did not need one  .
well that is definitely a line , however i is assured they would stand behind the drive (for a year)       but not my data  .
i bought an $4  .
95 8 desk fan and it runs when the maxtor runs  .
it sets about 10 away , aimed at the insufficent , natural ventilation holes in the front  .
this simple cooling (air flow) drops the temp to the 60's    70's  .
and another way to keep the data safe is only run the maxtor when you need to use it  .
one touch is a fine idea , but continuous running or this drive with no additional cooling is its end  .
from reading many reviews i can see it is a crash waiting to happen without a fan  .
my maxtor drive and its 8 cooling fan are still doing a great job  .
as a rule       the cooler electronics run the longer they last       maxtor ignored this rule in the poor cooling design of this unit .
i have had this drive for about a month and am very happy with it    so far  .
i use it strictly as a network attached storage device and therefore am not able to use nor do i need the one touch feature  .
other posts regarding early failure may yet prove prophetic for my drive to  .
it does get very warm after heavy use  .
i will definitely come back to this forum and tell all if the thing fails in the next two or three months .
i do not know what the fuss is all about  .
i've had my 160gb one touch for 6 months plus and i've had no problems  .
i have it running 24/7 under my computer desk with limited air circulation and i've had zero problems  .
i've never used it for backing up my internal hd and i've never used the software it came with  .
i use mine for music , downloads and as a video scratch .
i'm a dj and using the drive as a portable jukebox combined with my laptop has made gigs so much easier  .
no more hauling vinyl or cds  .
i can now take over 7000 320kbps song files with me wherever i go  .
try doing that with vinyl  .
after my computer's internal hard drive crashed , i reached over endearingly to my maxtor ext hard drive i had backed everything up onto , and it would not turn on  .
at the end of the day it seemed to be a power cord problem (which is weird , no external damage , no rough handling) so i got most of my data back  .
maybe us whiners got a bad batch , but i'm thumbs down on this one too  .
true also that it heats up to an alarming temperature .
i bought the maxtor one touch iii (160 gb) a few months ago to store my photos and music and other things that were slowing down my pc  .
earlier today , i tried to access my photos and realized that my computer is no longer recognizing the maxtor drive and there is no power getting to it  .
after checking out all simple fixes , i called the maxtor / seagate help line  .
within a minute , the woman i spoke to is able to determine what is wrong (obviously they've had some experience with this type of problem) and informed me that the device had failed  .
she told me that it's under warranty until may 2008 , so i will be able to have it replaced , but if i want the information off of the drive , i will have to pay to have that information recovered by their recovery service  .
i contacted them and is informed that they would attempt to retrieve the information , and if they were successful i would be charged somewhere around $1 , 400  .
i have all of my digital photos on here from the past three years births , parties , vacations , grandchildren you name it it's on there  .
i said i didn't understand why i would have to pay when it is their defective merchandise which caused the loss  .
the customer service attendant blamed me for not using at least two other forms of backup  .
i'll admit that i is foolish in not backing up the photos to disks , and i wo not make that mistake again  .
i am heartsick at the mementos that i have lost  .
i have to wonder , though , which is more profitable for seagate / maxtor selling drives or charging customers exorbitant fees to recover information from their defective devices  .
my backup harddrive just died  .
i press the blue button (as i have done for over 2 years) and nothing happens  .
there's no software button on my desktop to do a back up so the external drive now just sits there useless  .
i've had two good years but the seagate website is indecipherable so just to keep my life easy , i'm just going to buy another  .
but definitely not another maxtor  .
this is supposed to be my backup  .
it hardly gets used  .
what a hunk of junk .
my sister brought to me this 200gb maxtor ext hd (onetouch ii) in december beggining (i live in brazil)  .
one month later my computer couldn�t recongnize it anymore  .
i had moved all my digital photos to it and , suddenly , i couldn�t get then back  .
the problem is we can�t do much thing with a usb device  .
there�s no configuration , setups or anything else we can do to recover the data i wrote to maxtor because the 2 blue leds in front of the drive started to blink together , but the led code on the maxtor site doesn�t inform this situation after 6 or 7 asked and answers emails they couldn�t tell me what�s going on  .
like in brazil , these help desks centers are trully awful and they know less than we about they own products well , finnaly i asked maxtor if i sent the hd to us they would try to recover my data back  .
they said no  .
they would just give me another drive the important to me wasn�t the drive , but the data  .
so , i realize it would be safer with me i made a research in the net about this drive and i learned 2 things   a lot of costumers had problems with this product and it is just a internal drive with a external case maxtor said to me i shouldn�t open the external case because i would lose warranty but , like i said , if i had spent the drive to us i wouldn�t see my photos again i oppened the drive and installed it internally  .
it worked ok and i could get my data back  .
so , now i have a traditional 200gb internal drive working fine i tell you , my friends , don�t use this drive for backups  .
it�s not trustable .
this it a terrible hard drive  .
it worked ok , but very slowly for the first few weeks  .
i used it mainly as backup and extra storage for videos , mp3s , and pictures  .
i have it partitioned into 2 drives  .
the backup partition is lost once and i had to reformat , but luckily i did not loose any data  .
the other partition is corrupted once before , but the data  magically  recovered  .
now it is having problems again  .
chkdisk is frozen and won't close , my computer won't open , the drive wo not stop for safe removal , and it seems that only the data that  is not  backed up is gone  .
a 13gb folder subbenly became empty maxtor's support is only monday    friday , 8    5  .
i am not availible during those times  .
they do have email support (i just sent one) in addition to the non    reliability , it is slow  .
on the computer it is connected to , it transfers at up to 130 megabytes per second  .
on another computer with two internal drives , the transfer rate for backup is over 1000 megabytes per second  .
with this drive it can take many hours to back up do not buy it , and if you have one , do not trust it for important data .
this external hard drive does not work  .
i cannot get any of my files off of it  .
i have tried to explain it to the company and they do not understand what i'm telling them  .
i put all my music and picture files on it via drag and drop , and now cannot get them off  .
i cannot get any access to the drive  .
it tells me to insert a disk and obviously there is no place to insert a disk it is the disk  .
i would never recommend this product and for sure will never buy another one  .
their ads are misleading since they claim it is so easy to use it's a nightmare  .
period .
this drive is fine the first three months you have it , then it turns into a nightmare  .
i have lost more data than i care to think about using maxtor drives  .
buy lacie  .
they are 100 times better .
Good paper manual, smart and simple use; Needs proper care as all external disk drives do !
quiet, nice design, usb and firewire, mac and pc; apparently the packaged software sucks?
None - be sure to back up your info two more ways!; Defective Merchandise and Deceptive Practices
When it works, backs up with press of a button, quickly; just stopped working and the seagate website is nightmare of unhelpful info
Very fast and quiet, excellent backup software.; Gets rather warm after one or two hours runtime. Maybe this will lead to early failure but I don't know yet.
