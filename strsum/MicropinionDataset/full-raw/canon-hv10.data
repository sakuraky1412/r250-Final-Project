just recorded a jazz orchester and got the applause of the musicians for the good sound  .
no need for any extra microphone in my opinion  .
the mic  .
is placed in a way were it eliminates any capture of sound from the tape mechanism  .
i will say this becourse some scratches their hair trying to figure out why it is placed on top facing upwards it has a good sound the video quality is beyond anything i have ever seen  .
only comparable quality are imax films it has a very good grip and it can slip into a jacket pocket i do not see the reason why the shape has been attacket with such hatred  .
it has a real good shape  .
it is wonderfull to hold  .
and i am glad i did not go for the little fat barrels that are in fasion right now buy it  .
jens  .
if you appreciate canon's digital slrs line up , you will like this camera's cmos silky smooth video  .
my first reaction to the video is similar to when i got my first digital camera from canon (d30)  .
sharp , smooth , great color reproduction low light performance is not that bad  .
as long as you film in normal room lighting you will be fine  .
waited for a compact on the go hd package and now it is here  .
get yours today .
i love this camera for all around use , wilderness , street cam , concert etc easy to edit on macs  .
try to edit avchd camera video i dare you  .
you will have multiple problems of additional software , money , time and headaches  .
now they are shrinking avchd sensors and blowing up the compression to compensate    not as good as good old hi    def mini dv  .
hear me now believe me later  .
i just bought another hv10 new from buydig for 569  .
00 you cant beat that  .
this is my first hd camcorder  .
i've been using digital camcorders since june 1997 and this one is by far , the absolute best picture quality of any camcorder i've ever seen  .
keep in mind , i've never seen any other high    def camcorder , so i can only compare it to my experience with older analaog and 1st generation thru current digital camcorders  .
when i play the video back on my 72 hd tv , it looks as good or better than broadcast hd programming  .
i mean , the picture quality is spectacular  .
i disagree with the cnet video review that said the form factor is awckward  .
it's not  .
it's actually quite comfortable  .
it's odd at first because the strap is connected at a wierd angle , but once you get used to it , it actually makes sense  .
i've connected this to my pc with a firewire cable and dumped the videos and edited them  .
the firewire connection worked flawlessly  .
the pull    out screen is large and the best i've seen on a camcorder  .
i wish it did 24p  .
if it did , i'd give it a 10  .
but , because it lacks 24p and the menus are difficult , then i give it a 9 out of 10 .
bought this one refurbished for $544 from willoughbys , it looks like new , and all accessories were included  .
(it's sad when you are actually surprised to get the product as ordered  .
excellent video and color saturation  .
i is impressed , and i am a professional videograher  .
i mostly bought this camera because it can fit in my pocket and i like the fact that it records to mini    dv , and does not compress the image like hard drive or memory stick cameras do  .
it feels odd in your hand , and i have small hands (no jokes please  .
) anyway , you hold the camera and put your index finger on the zoom , and the other three just under the sensor and you pinky goes under the camera for extra stability  .
once positioned , it is easy to keep the camera study and on target  .
i also use my left index finger to slightly touch the lcd display for left and right panning without shakes great focus , and sound is good , but not fantastic  .
included remote has some nice features  .
battery life is too short , but all included batteries seem to have that problem image stabilization seems as good as my sony , i only wish they would make these cameras with either a longer zoom (20x) or built in wide angle  .
you will not be disappointed by the performance , and once you get the grip down , you will be fine .
considering this cam cost me 625 in nh (no tax) i cant find anything that compares for the money  .
i have 2 sony z1's and had to sell my hc7 cause the canon is all i needed  .
its not perfect but no hd camera stands out like the way the panasonic gs500 sd cam did  .
i have no brand loyalty but if you can get this for under $700 than you got something that is well constructed and captures pretty 1080 hd  .
if your parents can work the dvd player this is the camera for them .
i have to admit that i probably would not have purchased the hv10 when it first came out       for the full product price  .
but many people did because it is (and is) an excellent high definition camcorder  .
it is now selling for about half the price it originally listed for and this makes it a baragin , as well the hv10 has an excellent video picture       in daylight it has as good a picture as any of the non    professional hdv camcorders  .
many have knocked it for its low    light performance , but so far i have found it to be comparable to many of the camcorders i owned in the past  .
(certainly not as good as in bright light , but definitely worth watching  .
add to this the fact that (for a camcorder) it takes quite passable still photos , with many of the options for still photography that are usually only available on a dedicated still digital video camera  .
i would not buy the hv10 if still photography is your primary interest , but it takes 3  .
2 megapixel images that look good as long as you don't try to print them much larger than 5x7 or so the form factor of the camera is definitely a matter of personal taste  .
i happen to like the small upright design that the hv10 shares with the canon optura line and many sony camcorders  .
(in fact , i previously owned two sony camcorders with this form factor)  .
it may help that i have fairly small hands  .
before purchasing it , my wife and i compared it to the newer canon hv20 and the sony hc    7  .
we preferred the look and feel of the hv10 it does lack several features that may affect your desire to purchase it       as many have said , it lacks any means to add an external microphone or headphones  .
the sound from the built    in mic , however , is fine for my videotaping needs  .
(i own a directional mic for one of my sony camcorders , and it does improve sound , but i find that i rarely use it  .
) others have complained about the lack of an hdmi connector  .
i don't mind its omission (although it would have been a nice addition) because the componet output (using the provided cable) is similar in quality  .
i use the ilink connection (also known as firewire) to connect it directly to my sony hdtv       which not only transfers video and sound , but allows me to control the camcorder with the sony's remote  .
the ilink/firewire connection also provides for video connection to a mac or pc the hv10 weighs less than 1 pound and feels solid  .
it is handsome with ebony and silver design  .
(in comparison , i is unimpressed with the look and feel of the newer hv20       it feels too plastic and not as well made  .
i consider the fact that it records in hdv on minidv tapes one of its advantages  .
avchd camcorders that record on minidvds or hard disk do not (currently at least) generate video that is easy to edit with most of today's video editing software the hv10 is my first purchase of a canon camcorder (most of my previous camcorders were made by sony) , so i is not sure what to expect , but the quality is excellent  .
i miss the touch screen found on current sony models (many people do not like the touch screen , but i do) , and it is a bit harder to find canon accessories than sony accessories , but other wise i am quite satisfied  .
you probably will want to invest in another battery (the larger canon bp    315 battery will last approximately twice as long as the supplied battery) , and at some point you may want to purchase a wide    angle accessory lens such as canon wd    h37c , (like most consumer camcorders , the 10x zoom is somewhat lacking on the wide    angle side  .
as a mac user , i am pleased to report that it works with with imovie hd and iphoto right out of the box with no need for additional software the hv10 is apparently being phased out for the newer (but larger) hv20  .
this means that you can pick up the hv10 for a bargain price (as low as $700 at amazon  .
com)while they are still available  .
in my case , that's worth an extra point in the rating .
bought this as i is waiting for an hd camcorder  .
purchased for $850 at costco  .
if you are looking for a camcorder , go for this one  .
the hd picture quality is amazing  .
the still pictures are great also  .
the pros far outweigh the cons  .
highly recommend  .
as for mic issues i hear about , for the price its great  .
if you are looking for a pro camera , then you will have to pay the price for one  .
this if for the rest of us .
even though it has no hdmi cable , i got a firewire cable and can download hd to my laptop  .
the pinnacle software i got for free , works great and that is where the firewire cable works best  .
the software can control playback of the camera through the firewire cable  .
i do not own any hd viewing equipment , but with the upcoming birth of my first child i figured i'd thank myself in 20 years for capturing the memories in 1080i  .
the hv10 is a fairly low    priced hd alternative , and i love the small form factor i'm using premiere pro to capture and edit my clips , which are posted online right now (dvd later) my only complaint (a minor one) is that the wrist strap is a bit tight for my hands  .
this makes it tricky to hold the camera and also use the zoom control  .
i'd like to see the zoom control mounted in the rear with thumb access .
i have traveled with many video and still cameras  .
this fits in my pants pocket and takes great video still photos  .
i have bought many camcorders over the last 3 years and this is by far the best one .
i have had a dozen camcorders over the years and this one is just on a completely different level  .
the resolution and picture quality is nothing less than amazing  .
i live in sf and get ota hdtv in 720p and 1080i and the picture this camera delivers is every bit as good  .
in addition , i plugged it in to my macbook pro and it is automatically recognized in imovie hd and i is able to download the recorded video to my computer for editing with the click of a button  .
a mic jack would be nice , but does not affect me  .
however , it is difficult to get a consistently smooth zoom because the zoom switch is tiny  .
the difference between slow zoom and fast zoom should be more pronounced  .
i am sure that i will get used to it after time in conclusion , zero buyer's remorse i friggin love this camcorder on a side note , i ordered a canon sd800is digital camera at the same time and had to send it back it is a total piece of crap with completely unacceptable picture quality .
i've been really happy with this camcorder  .
picture quality is breathtaking on hd via component inputs , downsamples fine to dv for making dvds in imovie/idvd  .
low light capability is not as bad as some reviews  .
works fine in a normally lit room or at dusk i'm using it a lot for taking photos  .
have a look at  .
http  //www  .
flickr  .
com/photos/hbtphotos/  .
for some sample photos taken by this camera .
overall , this is a very good hd camcorder  .
but , why is it missing hdmi output  .
i just used this on a two week safari in botswana and it performed perfectly in that dusty environment  .
i had no problems what    so    ever  .
no glitches or lock    ups at any time the lcd screen is the best i've ever seen  .
you can see it well in bright daylight  .
i tried to use the viewfinder as much as possible , as the lcd drains the battery  .
the viewfinder has an adjustment for the diopter of your eye (so no need for glasses) i liked the compact size  .
it fit perfectly in the palm of my hand and stayed there even when the hippo brushed the boat i bought an extra battery that is larger than the one provided , as i never knew how much video i would shoot on each trip i now have to edit through four hours of tape and 4 gb of stills  .
i used the 2 gb mini    sd cards from san disk and kingston .
thanks for the review , which will definitely help buyers to make a more informed decision when selecting high    definition consumer products i would like to add one comment , though  .
the review states that canon hv10 records in 1080/60i , that��s a resolution of 1920 x 1080 at 60 interlaced fields per second , which is not accurate  .
although the full resolution of 1080i atsc standard is indeed 1920x1080 pixels , but hdv resolution is limited to 1440x1080  .
the pixels are anamorphic , i  .
, they are stretched horizontally to provide 16  9 aspect ratio of the whole picture lance  .

i bought this camera for one reason , to get better low light video quality  .
the sony camcorder i had previous to this is terribly grainy when shooting indoors with ambient day light conditions  .
with the cannon i can shoot indoors and only in very low light do i start to see the video degrade i do not care that it is not bundled with software  .
i find any software that is included with cameras (camcorders and digital cameras) to be useless anyway the controls (particularly the zoom control) takes a little getting used to , but otherwise this camera is easy to use in closing i'm very satisfied with this purchase  .
i purchased this camcorder in 14 months ago , november 2006 , for my family holiday disney vacation  .
it is a replacement for my sony digital 8  .
the viseo quality is outstanding  .
in low light it gets a little muddy , but it is much higher quality that any other camera that i have used the compact size is the main reason that i chose it over the sony  .
it actually fits in all of my jacket coat pockets  .
the image stabilization works well and the internal flash video light do a nice job when the subject is close the only negative thing to say is that the sound is not very directional because the mic is mounted on the top of the camera  .
so the sterio separation is poor and when there is alot of ambient noise , the subject's sound may be a bit washed out  .
i understand why there is no front mounted mic , because of the size and orientation , but a mic jack would have been a nice addition , even if it is in the form of an accessory shoe , like sony's the bottom line is that i am happy with my choice    the tiny size and fantastic picture quality are well worth the $1100 that i paid .
this a pretty neat little camcorder  .
for those folks considering a consumer    level camcorder that can do it all (at a reasonable price) , this is one to give serious consideration to  .
the video quality is excellent , still pics are very good too , audio quality is mediocre , however  .
one of its biggest attributes (its compact size) also contributes to one if its most significant drawbacks (poor ergonomics)  .
however , once you've worked with it a while it becomes tolerable  .
other issues to consider are its lack of video editing software and the fact the camera only comes in a tape version (no hard drive)  .
evenso , this unit probably represents the best value in consumer hd camcorders available right now .
i bought mine from costco  .
com for $800  .
it is more than i is looking to spend on a camcorder (it's not like i'm going to make an inde    film anytime soon)  .
being a mac person , i really needed one that is compatible with imovie hd  .
that ruled out minidvd models right off the bat  .
hdd would've been nice , but the picture quality was not there the canon hv10's 1080i picture quality is amazing  .
the built    in led light is extremely bright so i don't use it as much , but it's there if you need it  .
with firewire (not included) , it connects directly to my macbook pro and i can edit using imovie hd (awesome  .
i read a lot of complaints about the software that canon camcorders come with  .
i haven't even unpacked that cd the auto focus is extremely fast and the auto lens cover is fast as well  .
the view finder is very clear , even outside in daylight because of the upright design , you hold it near your chest for stability  .
then with the mic located on top of the camera , i could hear my breathing in the recording like darth vader  .
they did not include an external mic plug to fix this  .
zoom control is okay , but hard to keep the camera steady while pushing any button with the upright design  .
maybe that's why they went to a palm design for the hv20  .
the grey menu control wheel should've been on the left , not the right  .
i have to strain my right thumb to use it and it's impossible to keep the camera steady while using it it really is the best bang for the buck if you're looking for great picture quality .
hdv is a promosing new technology ,  .
the video or pix quality much better than traditional video camcorder hdv give a 3d look on objects , however , the 3d quality is just good , not great by any means the locations of buttons makes this feather weight camcorder quite difficult to handle with 1 hand overall get this hdv if u r tired of standard video  .
or u can wait for more mature and better hdv camcorders down the road .
i'm one of those people who is a bit of a techie but always behind the curve a year or so , heh heh  .
anyway , i decided to make the complete hdtv switch in 2007 , and part of that , is to retire my old sony dv for an hd all i can say is that this canon is such a quantum leap over the old format that words fail me  .
if one were to do an a/b video quality comparison (audio too  .
) between standard and hd , it would ruin one for life [i should state at this point that i'm playing the video (for the most part) on a pc through a geforce 7950gt hdmi to a 32 viewsonic lcd  .
video burned on a standard dvd is fantastic , but to bluray it's absolutely stunning  .
i know , i know the blue discs are pricey right now , but i do not see how you can do hd right without one  .
anyway , definition and color seperation are infinitely better than what i have ever experienced from a consumer camcorder even on a boat in moderate seas , the image stays sharp and focused , without the ghosting or jitteriness i've experienced from dv in the past i rated this fantastic camera an 8 simply because the operating interface is counterintuitive (until you get used to it) , and the menu is a bit confusing and prone to leading you in the wrong direction defaults work best it seems , though the low light function is awesome  .
i see here the price is down to about $900 (i paid $1 , 100 a few weeks back) , so it's likely the bloody thing will be down around what a standard high    end camcorder cost shortly if not , it's definitely worth the money now  .
i purchased this camera to record family events , and did'nt want to have to carry seperate cameras for still photo , and videos this camera has worked out great  .
it did take some time to get used to the very awkward controls , and terrible speaker location , you must whisper while recording the video , and still photos this camera produces will quickly make you forget about  .
this camers little quirks .
i have no problem with the verticle design  .
i have gotten used to it ok this is the low down  .
this camera provides great video at 1440x1080 in hdv format  .
apparently canon has a 1920x1080 cmos and then (scales down  .
) just like sony to meet the hdv format of 1440x1080  .
uug  .
how stupid  .
on the positive side , adobe premiere cs3 supports 1440x1080 video well  .
that software does not even support out of the camera 1920x1080  .
however , i think there might be a trick using the hdmi port if the video can be sent directly from the cmos to an hdmi card in the computer without being processed by the camcorder  .
for this reason i am now looking at a camcorder with hdmi (such as the hv20)  .
with the black magic design hdmi card , it might be possible to get real 1920x1080 video off of one of these cameras  .
i am not sure at what point the video is scaled down by the camera for the hdv spec  .
if the video can be pulled off at 1920x1080 then it could be dropped onto the adobe premiere timeline as 1920x1080 sequential images (like the idea behind motion jpeg) and then we are set  .
real hd 1920x1080 video  .
the camera can already do it but the folks at sony keep screwing up the works with their hdv and now their avchd  .
why do not you all just stop the crap and give us our 1920x1080 video and we will determine how to process it once we have it  .
avchd h  .
264 is a great encoding format (blu    ray , etc  .
) but for true editing you need sequential images that are not interlaced  .
all of these cameras are interlaced and therefore none of them give true 24p (non interlaced images)  .
that is the problem  .
believe it or not the cheapie cameras that use motion jpeg come closer to giving us what we really need as editors  .
however , the most promising idea is hdmi out of the camera into hdmi port in the computer using black magic design's software to create sequential images  .
that is what i am going to try next  .
canon and sony only want to sell logos to unsuspecting consumers that are caught up in the compression craze when in fact the most serious compression should come after editing on the timeline not before  .
and to sell a 24p consumer camcorder when it can not do 24p because of interlacing is misguided  .
shame on you canon (hv20)  .
it is now almost 2008 and we are still using interlaced camcorders that were developed for television years ago  .
let's get with the times .
i bought this camera fully aware of the lack of hdmi and lack of external mic jack , so i'm not going to complain about that  .
i am very happy with the video quality  .
it looks wonderful on my plasma high    def tv unfortunately , i'm very disappointed that you can hear the tape mechanism on the audio track  .
the review that stood in a quiet room and still did not hear the hum , must have an exceptionally quiet one , becasue it is easily discerable in normal noise settings  .
i'm really amazed that they would design it like this .
every now and again company's shoot themselves in the foot  .
to produce a high quality image video camera without a high quality sound imput jack is just such a foot shooting exercise .
hv10 does not come with any way to capture or edit video  .
when i had trouble using powerdirector , canon customer care (  .
) told me they do not test the camera with third party software  .
since they have no software of their own , i guess you're suposed to do their testing for them  .
by the way , the trial version of pinnacle will not work for capture either .
god i thought this camera would be amazing for me    it sounded too good to be true    1080 hd for an unbeatable price turned out it is too good to be true the audio quality is unbelievably bad  .
the microphone is positioned on top of the camera , so it picks up all the nasty wind noise , as well as the operators every breath basically , it sounds like im having sex everytime i breath also , there is no external plug for a microphone do not buy  .
stay far away .
