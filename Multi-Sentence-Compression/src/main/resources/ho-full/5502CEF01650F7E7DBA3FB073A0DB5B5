we 've spent three nights in the oberoi grand and we had a fine stay .
as in almost all the other five star hotels that we stayed in the staff was very friendly and helpfull ( at breakfast one of the girls even helped feeding our baby daughter when she refused to eat ) , the hotel is clean and has this old colonial style which does give it something extra to the other hotels in kolkata .
we had a suite which was nice , unfortunately the view was n't one to write home about , so when you book a room try to get one with a view on the court yard/ pool .
at the time when we were there it was very crowded at the entrance . . .
each day it took some time before our driver was able to pick us up due to some activities that were taking place in the hotel .
roomservice is not cheap . . .
it 's the first time that i noticed the high prices for a normal meal , but perhaps it 's simply because i did n't pay much attention to it at our previous holidays .
the hotel is close to most of the interesting places in kolkata . . .
not far from quest mall , park street , mother ( theresa ) house , st paul 's cathedral and my favourite the victoria memorial hall .
it has a nice thai restaurant , so you do n't even have to go far to eat nice food , something different from indian all the time .
next time . . .

next time i go to kolkata i would seriously consider going again and i do recommend people to come and stay here for a few days , specially when you like old style hotels with friendly staff and good service.
