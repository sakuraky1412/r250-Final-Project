my family ( 2 adults , 2 children aged 6y & 3yrs and our baby infant ) stayed in the upstairs 3 bedroom apartment .
on arrival we were amazed at the size being a full 3 bedroom house with large kitchen , dinning & lounge flowing onto a good sized deck entertaining area all over looking the main township of paihia and unobstructed seaview of the bay across to russel .
the 3 bedroom were 1 x master queen with ensuite , another double room with queen bed & smaller room with twin singles , the lounge also had twin sofa fold out beds .
the apartment/house has nice comfortable fittings and furnishings that are pratical for familes or groups of friends staying and includes a full kitchen , laundry ( washer & dryer ) , bbq , full sky digital tv channels which are all included .
the apartment was n't serviced in our two night stay however everything was there that we needed when we arrived .
and the location has everything , beach , shops , cafes/resturants , nightlife is within an easy 2-5 minute walk .
the hosts jenny & malcomn were friendly and helpful but not overwhelming in anyway and once were sure we were happy left us to enjoy .
we have stayed in other 4-5 star rated accommodation in paihia on 2-3 occassions over recent years and paid alot more for a lot less in the way of view , size , location & service .
at $ 150 nz per night this was awesome value for a peak . . .

even though the weather was n't good we felt very comfortable and will definatley be back there to stay hopefully for a longer holiday next time .
would highly recommend for families and groups of friends wanting a n excellent base to stay and explore all that paihia , boi & northland has to offer.
