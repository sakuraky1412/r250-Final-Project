it is within walking/short cab distance from most in the city and provides a fun , comfortable , luxury stay that we absolutely loved !
the lobby is like no other doubletree out there and we loved the light show as we sat at the bar watching the world cup .
the executive room was large , comfortable , and perfect for a night 's couple stay away .
i would say this was one of our best hotel stays overall except our experience at breakfast the next morning .
first off , we are very laid back and not much bothers us when it comes to service .
served tables , worked many little customer service type jobs- so i know days are not always the best .
however , we just experienced very lazy hostess service at our sunday breakfast .
the wait was somehow 30 minutes for a buffet and the communication on the wait time was said in a way in which the lady was very busy .
however , she did not really do much as we waited and many customers waited while the coffee tubs were not filled .
when we were finally sat , it took quite a while to get greeted and the whole experience for a quick breakfast ( we thought ) took about an hour and a half .
the breakfast definitely did not take away from an outstanding stay as we will probably stay here again in the future .
highly recommend this hotel but just grab breakfast down the street in . . .
