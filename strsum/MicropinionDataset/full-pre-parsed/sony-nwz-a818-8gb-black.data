leave it to the minds at sony to deliver what ipod , zune , and other mp3 players only wish they could be  .

easy to use  .

great sound  .

you can customize the sound to your just how you like it  .

loading songs is so simple  .

drag drop what you have  .

no proprietary evilness like itunes and such  .

long battery life  .

hey these guys gave us playstation mini discs , which were way ahead of the curve so you know their mp3 player would be the same  .

burn your ipod's zune's and whatever and get one of these now  .

it's groovy baby  .

this is my first experience in purchasing an mp3 player  .

i did not think that i could justify the cost of an ipod , and i've always been a sony fan , so i did some research on the sony mp3 players  .

i trust the reviews on cnet , and i is very impressed with all of the favorable reviews on this model  .

i is still able to get this model , and it is even under $100 so i went for it  .

i couldn't be happier  .

the sound quality is great , and i love the ease of use  .

i have a lot of cds in my collection , and it is so easy to copy them to the sony  .

i may not copy every single one of them , but i have plenty of room to copy the ones i particularly want i must admit that when mp3s came out , i didn't feel that i really needed one since i had my sony cd players  .

but i'm very glad that i took the plunge , especially since i do quite a bit of traveling , and the mp3 player is much handier to take along like other reviewers , i cannot quite understand why the ear buds are the way they are , but i have other headphones so it's no big deal , i guess i would recommend this sony to anyone who wants great sound and ease of use  .

you could not do any better , and the price is great too  .

like the last reviewer , i picked up this player as an online sale item from circuit city  .

why pay for the latest 8gb model when it offers little more than what this prior year model has  .

owned an ipod a few years back   sucked  .

sound quality is mediocre at best  .

still own two creative labs players   their software (which you must install before use) sucks and sucks hard  .

plus i've had repeated problems syncing either player to my computer over time  .

while the creatives sound really good i did have to go out and spend $100 to get some decent headphones (apples blew as well) having grown up using sony walkman tape players i is always a fan of sony audio products until the world went digital  .

since that time sony has gone out of its way to make music lovers lives difficult  .

between their proprietary software , codecs and everything else sony has really shot themselves not in the foot , but in the head for the past 8 or so years  .

when i saw this particular player on sale i immediately checked both cnet and consumer reports and found nothing but positive feedback on this player's model line and i am impressed  .

completely and utterly to be frank my only complaint is the stupid headphone cord  .

i understand the left is shorter so that it can be kept out of the way when the player is used with an arm band , but most folks don't do that sort of thing  .

and for this taller guy (6'4 ) the extra cord still is not long enough such that i can put this player in my pants pocket without it tugging on the left side  .

irritating , but i've found a few solutions  .

otherwise without a doubt this is the best sounding player i've ever owned  .

apple has always been mediocre at sound quality , but even my creative products do not live up to the standard set by sony in this unit  .

the included headphones are the best i've ever encountered that came with a player    i haven't even bothered to pull out my $100 shure's  .

why bother  .

i love , love , love the fact that all i had to do is connect the player to my computer , startup windows media player and off i went  .

no proprietary software to monkey with  .

no special drivers to first install  .

nothing  .

there is software for the player , which you can download from sony , but i haven't yet seen a reason to do such  .

my creatives each required their own software installation and the software pretty much sucks in my opinion  .

sony really nailed it on the head with this approach  .

why reinvent the wheel when itunes , wmp and a handful of other free media playing software apps will do the job just fine  .

there are plenty of sound enhancement options ; maybe too many , but that is not a criticism  .

i do like how the player will preview , if you will , the effect of each equalizer setting before you select it  .

and not one , but two custom settings  .

marvelous the cnet reviewer lists some cons , such as the lack of a radio  .

i too used to consider this to be a con (especially with apple products) , but over the years i've completely changed my mind  .

i purchased a mp3 player to begin with so that i would not have to listen to radio  .

certainly there may be some radio i may wish to enjoy at any given moment , but on the whole i can live without that feature and instead enjoy my own music i cannot say anything about the video features or capability of this unit as i have neither used them nor intend to do so  .

i already have way too much music to make space for video so , if you want a new mp3 player and cannot find this particular model or model line any longer i'll take a chance and recommend the replacement model line  .

if they are anywhere near as good as this one you cannot be dissatisfied in my opinion .

i found this little gem on sale at circuit city for $70  .

after looking into the reviews , i figured i'd give it a shot  .

the player is very user friendly and simple to set up  .

audio quality is top notch , much better than my husband's new zune  .

the fact that it uses windows media player is great for me , as that is my default player on the computer ( i hate zune's software , too many bugs , and just don't like itunes either  .

) the earphones have great sound , especially considering they are what sony includes in the package , usually those earphones included in anything are rather , well , crappy and uncomfortable  .

the cord is a little short , but once you add the extension (thoughtfully included in the package) , i find they are long enough to slip the play in one of my pockets and not have a wire trailing me around  .

the display is crystal clear , like having a little hi    def tv in my pocket , but i have to admit that i haven't tried to watch any videos on it , i just listen to music  .

the playback modes (shuffle , repeat , repeat and shuffle) all seem to work perfectly for me  .

have not created many playlists yet , but will be simple enough  .

one of my favorite features would have to be the equalizer  .

it's what my husband misses on his new zune and why i'm going to have to keep an eye on my player  .

you can chose one of the presets , or create up to two custom settings  .

i would highly recommend this player to anyone considering it  .

if this particular model came any larger (30gb or more) i would definitely buy one for hubby , too  .

he may get one anyways , since the new zune already has to be sent in for service .

i love this mp3 mainly because the mp3 has awesome video and audio quality  .

ibought it for $99  .

99 at best buy (4gb)it is a great and a small mp3 and its worth the price  .

the only thing that i hated is that i had to pay $12  .

95 for the video software to convert video into mp4 plus it takes a really long time for the video to convert  .

but thats my only grip (sony should really just include the software you need when you purchase the mp3  .

wow , this player is the player of the year , if there is such a title , well , i guess having it win the editors choice is good enough  .

great sounding player , i love how it give more bass on every music i throw at it  .

when i had put a mp4 video , it is clear and bright , but the screen is finger print friendly  .

the chrome edge gets fine scratches easily just like the 4 gen ipod's back metal  .

but the black case feels strong that i want to run it over with a car and see if its still works  .

that is first thing that came in my mind when i is feeling it  .

hehe  .

thank you sony  .

anyone who hates the ipod should get one of these  .

i is in the market for the new zunes but i heard sony is releasing new mp3 players i had to check them out  .

i've not yet listened (played with one in circuit city) to one but from what i read and being someone who's owened walkmans before i can say it'll sound great no matter what  .

the controls are simple and keep you from getting lost and i love the independent volume  .

i won't give it a low rating just because of a goofy hold switch and besides this thing does not have a touchy scroll wheel so accidentally pressing buttons wont be a big deal  .

it has a nice light weight feel which means it wont break when dropped  .

sony did a great job  .

the ipods have bad sound quality because they look stylish , now who sits around staring at an mp3 player all day  .

apple's idea must be if it sells ; why improve  .

this is an mp3 player and it does just that .

this is a really nice player with really good battery life and soudns really good  .

i love this player and that all i can say  .

get one  .

day one , brought a 4g ipod nano ($229 nzd)  .

took it back the next day , why , itunes  .

next day philips gogear vibe ($149 nzd) , took it back , too basic in operation  .

screen is too small as well then at last this bad boy ($200 nzd)  .

as a professional musician i needed a player that could make playlists of music for between our band sets  .

sometimes we have rock , pop and hiphop , or easy listening depending on the venue  .

and she does it all  .

first copy over your albums and tracks in ms media player  .

then using mp build up playlists and drop them in the sync window  .

if the song is on the player it doesn't copy it over just keeps it referenced in the playlist one other important thing is its wakeup speed  .

don't what to be waiting for the break music to kick in or the crowd with walk off  .

the a828 starts playing almost instantly from off  .

something the philips did not as stated in the cons , i thought that i should be able to pair up the player with my laptop for bluetooth transfer of music but that is a no go  .

bluetooth is a handy technology but is not that greatly use in products here in new zealand as yet not intentionally but looking back at the portable music player i have had over the years they are always sony , my cassette walkman , my minidisc , my hd minidisc , and now this a828  .

keep up the great work .

bought this at the sony store for 80  .

00 and i downloaded over 1000 songs and man does this thing work  .

really easy to use  .

listened to a few of the ipods and nothing compared  .

never figured sony would outdo apple  .

buy this unit  .

you wo not be sorry .

as a audio device , the a818 is finally proven to me that sony is again on the ball  .

it does everything just about perfectly and is a breeze to manage (either with wmp11 or just using windows explorer)  .

as a video device well , i'm not the best person to ask since i never really have a chance to use these portable devices for video  .

use at the office precludes it , and since i drive for my commute that time is obviously exclusionary to such a use  .

having just purchased it , i've yet to take the a818 on a plane trip  .

but since i've long had issue with even using a comparatively massive psp's screen for video viewing , i think i'd pass on the a818 as well  .

but in fairness , the spider    man 3 trailer preloaded on the a818 did look nice , even if it's way too small for comfort for my eyes as for sonics , the a818 is certainly among the very best daps i own  .

i still prefer the zune 80's sq over this sony , but my particular zune is starting to show poor battery performance and until now has had irritating noise issues during song track transitions  .

the a818 certainly blows away the zune 80 in terms of form factor even if it only has 1/10th the capacity  .

when i do compare apples    to    apples , so to speak , i prefer the a818's sound over my equally    sized , flash    based zune 8 , and prefer both to the sonic performance of apple's 3g ipod nano , which my wife uses management of the player is simple ; there are specific folders for the various types of media that can be loaded on the sony ; it's as easy as dragging    and    dropping files and/or whole folders within windows explorer  .

wmp11 is a bit more sluggish to use ; even though it could read my itunes library folder and files for all of those aac    format songs i use with the various ipods and zunes , it didn't mean that it  .

liked  .

doing it  .

in the end , i just reverted to windows explorer and saved on the heartache the headset of choice with any of my daps these days is shure's se530 ; the shure/sony combo is excellent sounding given the compressed files that i normally use for portables  .

i haven't bothered with seriously using the toss    in earphones that came with the sony ; maybe someday i may try but i sorely doubt it since i've found i have little tolerance for the unequal length l/r leads that sony likes doing with their bud sets including these that came with the a818 that said , i'd have to say that the sonic performance of these in    ears are actually somewhat acceptable given what they are , if a little thin and nasal in tonality , texture and depth  .

reproducing details is fair    to    good if a bit inaccurate and colored in tone  .

but the wires are low    budget thin and don't inspire any sort of sense of longevity with use , nor am i a fan of having to use the separate extension chord to get any sort of reasonable length to the setup  .

the technique of looping the cable leads over the ears is mandatory to cut down on the plainly obvious microphonics  .

decent enough to use if you're not in the mood to buy an aftermarket set , but only just in the end it still comes down to the player itself  .

and from my narrow , audio    only experience , the sony nwz    a818 has been a solid winner , something that only a couple years ago i would've never thought possible  .

no it doesn't do all the things that a nano or even a zune 8 can do , but it does not  .

need  .

it plays music beautifully and with a clean , simple interface that plain works and ultimately makes me wonder just what all the fuss is with the click wheel in the first place a real winner , sony  .

i guess i'm going have to start thinking about taking all those nasty words i've said about you in the past .

sony rocks again the mp3 player market with a great sounding media player  .

i always appreciate the sound quality of walkman as compare to ipod and other mp3 players  .

sony 818 is an amazing player that sounds absolute right out of the box  .

the perfect companion for this walkman is sony's mdr ex90lp earbuds which provide superb sound quality with clear vocals  .

the clear bass technology , clear stereo , dsse and equilizers are the sound enhancement options that provides users with an option to customize the sound as per their taste  .

the design for this player is nice (not extraordinary) and sleek with real classy finish  .

the screen provides clear video and crisp pictures for viewing  .

drag and drop the songs (less time consuming than using a software) overall this player is perfect for those who really enjoy and appreciate quality sound  .

ipod and other mp3 players are good competitors but lack in sound quality (which defeats the sole purpose of buying a portable audio device) though they have appealing touch screen interface  .

apple invests more in style , looks and interface whereas sony invests in r d for sound quality , battery life , durablility , advance technical features and style too  .

choice is your's now  .

happy shopping  .

i have this unit in red , but the color does not matter , because it is the sound that rocks  .

i also have an ipod touch , and i use that for my podcasts and i tunes , but this is the perfect unit for the gym , and riding my bike  .

plus , the sound quality is out of this world it has a fully adjustable eq that you can tweak and the trubass is excellent in bumping your bass up a notch the sound is so clear and defined it is silly  .

and it plays every kind of music file that is on the market if your looking for a great alternative to an ipod , this is the way to go .

amazingly slim , sleek , and nice looking device  .

but what shines the most are the ear buds that come with this device and possible some of the best sound quality for any portable device i've ever heard  .

you have to listen to this to believe it  .

great eq and cool affects that really takes listening to music to a new level  .

sync with windows media player to get large pictures for cover art  .

great as a drag and drop device but i use windows media to sync .

i have had this one for about a month now  .

the sound quality is great  .

syncing with media player 11 is a snap  .

do not miss the fm tuner as it will hold enough songs for all day variety  .

i have 1500 songs on my 8gb at 128kbs/mp3 and still have room to grow  .

the shuffle all and time machine shuffle provides a unique mix  .

wish i would have waited another month for the upgraded version  .

ordered mine on a monday from sony and on tuesday sonys web site said they had a new model coming out with a larger screen and button configuration  .

this is a must have if sound quality and ease of use are important  .

the ear buds cord are suffiecently long enough to put player in watch pocket of jeans  .

over all this is a must have  .

sony has come along way since my first walkman cassette .

i love this new mp3 player from sony  .

they really paid a lot of attention to sound quality  .

i have heard the ipod nano and they have an acceptable sound quality but this sony blows them away in my opinion  .

you owe it to yourself to give this unit a listen  .

you'll be very surprized  .

i only wish that i had gotten the 4g version  .

rock on  .

the sound quality of this thing is great  .

came with earbuds worth listening with  .

the eq and surround sound options really help clean up varying quality of mp3's  .

i had one of the new nano's for awhile , broke it  .

replaced it with one of the new zune's hated it  .

tried the sony , and loved it the only major downside to this player is it is a little awkward to move music around to it  .

the sony musicmanager software ran a little choppy on my laptop , really slow and locked up randomly but that may just be my pretty basic laptop  .

i do not like windows media player for music , and i tried to get to know it better using this player and using the sync tab wound up randomly removing tracks from my library and moving them entirely to the device  .

i am off and on using winamp to try to manage playlists and it's working ok , but it's easiest to just drag and drop  .

i'd like the 8gb a little better (could not find one retail when i bought mine) and would really love to have the 8gb play  .

flac , with the sound quality the sony has , this thing with  .

flac ability would really rock so overall , if sound quality is more important to you than plug n play with the ease of itunes , give the new walkman a shot  .

the number one reason i wanted to post a review is to clarify misinformation i found scattered around the web , even on rhapsody's own compatible device list  .

the nwz    a818 absolutely works with rhapsody to go service , just be sure that's what you're actually paying for and not just the unlimited service  .

extremely simple to transfer music to the device  .

got to love the ability to add virtually any album you desire to your mp3 player all for about the price of one cd a month overall , i think this is a fantastic player  .

i don't know what the complaint about the hold button being on the back really comes from  .

i'd say if anything that's a more logical place (at least the way i hold the player , my middle finger is right on the button) basically , this player has about everything one could want , and if you shop around , you can get a pretty good price on it  .

i paid $170 and that was not even the sale price  .

file transfers are a breeze , just drag and drop really  .

the screen is bright and sharp , and while the itouch might be all the rage these days i like tactile feedback so i don't have to actually look at the player to control it  .

personally , i'm very sensitive to sound quality , and this unit surpassed even my high expectations  .

crisp highs , smooth lows , and with the eq easy to tailor to your style on the downside , i very much wish sony made an armband for this player so i wouldn't worry so much about it dropping out of my pocket while at the gym  .

also , while i've transfered playlists from rhapsody they don't seem to be acknowledged by the player , so i assume you have to recreate them internally (though i haven't tried to figure that one out yet)  .

lastly , the headphones , while great and definitely stay comfortably in place , even at the gym , the two    piece cable and different length earbud cables is slightly annoying  .

granted , if they actually made an armband for this player the ability to shorten the cable length would play greatly in this units favor  .

but until then , it's kind of pointless overall , i highly recommend this player to anyone looking for an alternative to trendy (ipod) players  .

this is flat out better than the nano , hands down lastly , and i'm repeating this here in hopes to help people like me who couldn't find reliable information on the web    this unit works with rhapsody to go , just do not forget to upgrade your rhapsody account to that level of service first good job sony  .

quit complaining about poor    quality headphones  .

no mp3 player out there has more than decent headphone quality it doesn't exist ; don't be disappointed if it falls short  .

buy your mp3 player without the expectation that you'll get a quality of headphone that is worth the $50    300 quality range that you're expecting  .

instead , complain about the computer not recognizing your player and the angst of having to search online for updated drivers  .

complain about no drag and drop music file features  .

complain about your player freezing up in the middle of a shuffle and it going back to song 1 when you restart it  .

complain about having to download new music player softwares that clogs up your machine and doesn't work perfectly with your os just so you can sync your player  .

complain about all those things with other mp3 players    because this sony model doesn't have any of those frustrating setbacks that i have been plagued with by every other player i've had an ipod and is forced to download itunes (i like using my windows media player better    not to mention the drag and drop sync sony has) , the hard drive is too delicate for me to go jogging in inclimate temperatures and the machine eventually froze up , the hard drive became corrupted , and became a very expensive paperweight  .

i've bought other hard drive players    which couldn't be recognized by my machine , even after downlading and installing the correct drivers and making sure my computer had all its updates  .

i've had terrific inexpensive flash players (durability , ease of use) that didn't have certain standard features such as ; sorting through music by genre , year , album , artist or song , or most importantly    shuffle  .

i've read about so many things that can go wrong with their competition    and this sony player doesn't have one negative attribute  .

it is the only player i found that it had mainly positive reviews the zune makes you use it's own software why on earth would a microsoft mp3 player not be compatible with a microsoft os's media software is beyond me  .

unacceptable  .

apple doesn't have an fm radio (and i'm not shelling out an extra $50 for apple radio just to listen to the tvs when i work out at the gym , etc)  .

on another note    the zune and apple 8 gb cost as much as their 30 gb , and it breaks my heart and my wallet to spend that much on a flash player  .

i want to go with the largest amount of memory on a flash player rather than buy a hard drive player because they are more hardy and durable than a hard drive and it can take more abuse  .

the new sandisk players seem to have a lot of problems with freezing up and driver issues    and i'll spend the extra $40 bucks or so if it saves me the angst and energy i'd have over difficult and malfunctioning machines i have had many disappointments with mp3 players (except for my $35 creative labs 1gb , it served it's purpose    but you get what you pay for) ; breakdowns , software issues , crappy features , and some not working from the get go (do not buy used non    apple mp3 players ; even from the company that distributes it  .

in my case anyway    two for two on that note) but this sony has met all my expectations and i would highly reccommmend it  .

the only drawback is expensive , priority sony accessories but that's just sony and i accept that , just as i accept poor quality headphones .

worth every penny  .

i love it  .

you will too .

no duden en comprarlo , si lo que buscan es el mejor sonido , este lo tiene soy dueno de un creative , un rio , otro sony y por comparacion este es el mejor .

i just got this player and can say i'm very pleased with it  .

i first got the nwz    610 by accident , which is a very nice player but the 81x models are in my opinion the one to get unless you want a fm receiver built in the build quality feels substantial with metal casing and tactile buttons  .

in the past i have tried using portable audio players with pressue sensitive controls and found they are not for me  .

i could never could get used to them or get them to do exactly what i wanted the first time around  .

the controls on this player are very exact in my opinion and only do what you want the screen is 2 size and it's bright and easy to see  .

video/pictures can be flipped horizontal if you so desire the volume button is nicely placed on the side not sticking out to far but far enough it's easy to go up/down  .

the hold button is on the lower back of this player and the headphone jack is on the bottom , some people might not like that , i have no issues with the placement though the ui is a breeze to use and moves fast , i never find myself waiting for the player to catch up with my inputs unlike some other players i have tried as for sound quality i find it very good and the supplied earbuds with this player are very nice for being bundled with it , though the cord could be a bit longer the issues i have which may be taken care of with future firmware updates are this unit could use more features like on the go playlists and such  .

nothing that takes away but would be nice to have .

who needs fm radio and voice recorder anyway  .

you spend money on music and an mp3 then listen to fm radio  .

it's like slap in the face for buying something cost close to $200  .

anyway this is an excellent mp3  .

the best sound out there  .

only thing i notice it download a little longer compare to sansa e280 and archos 605 wifi (which i got for a short time) yes i bought those two  .

and this one is a sure keeper  .

i bet you will love it or your money back  .

(but not from me)  .

i think the most important aspect of any mp3 player is the way the music sounds  .

the a818 is the best sounding player i have used  .

my ipod (nano 2nd gen)sounds o  .

and the software is very well thought out , but the nano sound doesn't compare to the sony  .

when i put some grado headphones (at home) or sennheiser pmx 60's (walking around) the a818 is a real treat  .

the music fatigue factor does not happen with the a818  .

the sony just sounds so much fuller and has a wonderful bass response , especially with higher (192    256) bitrate music  .

good job sony  .

apple should borrow some sony thinking  .

hey , it's the way it sounds that counts , not how small or thin we can make it .

forget the con of no fm radio  .

i bought this player because i wanted an mp3 player with excellent sound reproduction  .

this unit does not disappoint  .

i read the reviews and resisted but i had to see what the fuss is about  .

already having and archos 104 with decent sound quality , i wanted to see if this player is better  .

all i can say is its amazing  .

its intuitive enough to use right out of the box and with my denon ah    c350 earbuds it sounds awesome  .

the included earbuds sound great too but they are not as efficient if you want an mp3 player that allows you really get into the subtleties of your music , you cannot go wrong with this player  .

the battery life is also incredible  .

as someone who sometimes takes 20+ hour flights to asia for business , this player is must .

i had a sony hd    50 mp3 player until someone took it off my desk at work  .

since then , i've been using an iriver player  .

well , one listen to sony's player i've come back home to the best player in the world .

this mp3 player is phenomenal the sound is amazing  .

i mostly listen to progressive house/trance and dance music and let me tell you , with the sound on this thing , it feels like your live right in the club next to the speaker  .

it's even good for future hearing loss from listening to loud music because it's toned down and not a sharp loud sound  .

it's a very comfortable yet deep sounding tone  .

i wanted something different since everyone and their brother has an ipod and boy am i more than happy with this  .

if your looking for a real    to    life sounding music player , this is the one for you  .

i am very critical and selective so you can count on this review  .

only problem with an accesory that i have come across is that there is no armband for the gym (which is mainly what i need this for)  .

but , sure enough i found one (made by dlo for the samsung t10 mp3 model # of the case is 005    2425) at best buy that fits this thing perfect (except for the volume control and hold button , which is easily pressed through the case and the hold button is at the bottom so you can easily slip finger through and switch it)  .

just make sure this is the correct fit when your at the store because i threw the box out and i am getting all the case info from bb website  .

im sure it's this one , but if it's not find the ones that look most similar to this because one of them will fit this player perfectly , i should know cause i have it  .

go for it guys  .

i have never written a review before but i decided to write one for this mp3 player  .

g's , it's way better than the i pod and zune altogether  .

the sound quality is just great .

i've been using this mp3 player for 4 months now and its pretty reliable  .

it haven't had any bugs or glitches , and the controls are very responsive  .

nothing in this player feels cheaply made or flimsy  .

i like how the hold button is on the back as its easier to access when you have it in your pocket rather than being in the top or next to the headphone jack  .

the sound quality is amazing , i have not heard anything this good  .

the bass is tight , the highs are crips and clear  .

with this player , i can barely notice distortion even at high level  .

compared to ipod nano (3rd gen) and ipod (5th gen) both of which i own , this sony player outperforms it the two in sound quality and consistency of interface .

its just great listening experience  .

at present no other digital media player offers such great sound quality  .

this is how a music player should sound like  .

i is tired of bad sound quality of earlier mp3 players , even ipod  .

this player just brings so much of joy while listening music on the go  .

the sound is really punchy , very good bass , good equalizer and surround controls  .

apart from its great sound feature , its really easy to use from loading media to navigation while listening  .

the screen is really good and bright and video looks really great only minus is , it does not have a fm tuner which i think sony should include in its next version of this series  .

i will give this machine 9 in 10 .

i've had this unit for a couple of weeks now and its the best mp3 player i've ever owned  .

it has great sound quality and comes with really nice earbuds , unlike the crap earbuds you get with other mp3 players  .

its easy to use with an intuitive interface , and since sonicstage has been ditched transferring songs over is as simple as can be  .

the battery life is great , its well built , and amazingly has really good image quality on that tiny screen  .

i've been using an 8 gb up until recently and this unit pretty much blows it away ; better sound quality , better battery life , and a better interface  .

i will miss itunes , however my one real complaint is that it seems to only support wmp playlists  .

i'm not a big fan of wmp so this is a con for me , but its really just a personal preference  .

hopefully the upcoming sony media manager will fix this for me this is an all    around excellent player , and i highly recommend it .

sony nwz    a810 series of portable media players are superb at what they , and that is being simple  .

good , classy looks , without being evertly flashy  .

no special soft to sync the player , wide assortment of playable audio formats , overall ease to use .

what a great job sony has done  .

i am so used to walking in a sony store and quickly viewing the mp3 player selection and feeling slight stomach pains when i see that darn sonic stage software advertised with each and every one  .

you see i is a big sony guy back when md players were the new thing  .

i absolutely have never heard any portable device sound as flawless and clear as that good ol' network md player until now  .

thing is back then , it used to take me hours upon hours to get the music encoded correctly in atrac format  .

i would have to re    encode all the mp3's and to my surprise , when i would come back to the computer , one track would sometimes have an error , and i would have to re encode the remaining songs  .

i'm sure you sony people know what i'm talking about imagine my surprise when i walk in the sony store once again and gracefully step up to the shiny glass counter and see some rather attractive players  .

what's this  .

drag and drop  .

hmmmm cannot be  .

no software required  .

liars  .

at about this point , i feel a little dumb because a week previous i picked up my first true mp3 player the mighty ipod classic (80gb) i know i know but hey , i figured i bought 3 of them for different family members over the years and i may as well give it a try since the price is good and it is the #1 mp3 player  .

well to put it bluntly , the ipod is a beautiful player , has a nice interface , lots of storage , nice screen , and has a great price  .

but when i turned this thing on , and synced my music , it left me wondering , is it defective  .

why do all of the songs sound crackly , flat , and dull  .

there was not one sound preset i could select that would make me feel like it sounded remotely like my old sony md player oh sorry i'm all over the place  .

well i ended up returning the ipod the day after i went to the sony store to walmart , which put me in the awkward position of stretching the truth due to their ipod return policy of only returning the device back to an official apple store  .

i went back to the sony store and picked up the 8gb player and hot damn  .

this is what a music player is supposed to sound like  .

punchy sound , great bass without the crackling sounds or weird thumps , clear , brilliant highs , and just provides the listener with a phenomenal sound stage  .

when i'm spending $200    300 on a piece of equipment , based around audio , it has got to bring my music library to life and make me eager to hear the things the musicians intended the listener to hear and experience  .

great job sony  .

we can go on and talk about the lack of fm tuner and the weird placement of the hold button , but i'm giving this player a 9 just because it really defines what a great listening experience , on the go , is all about .

i just got this player from circuit city for $129 and it is simply amazing  .

i also have the new ipod nano , and i can safely say that ipod is way behind the sony in sound quality .

this thing sure stoped apple in its footsteps , for me anyways  .

i have only used an ipod nano and this thing , and i is very impressed with this one  .

i love the customizable equalizer , the earphones are a perfect fit , block out outer sound well enough plus give you a sweet deal of bass  .

the only issue i had with this is switching from the ease of volume control from the ipod nano to pushing buttons located nowhere near the main controls  .

but for the video playback the nano didnt have , nicer bigger screen it didnt have , it is a sure winner , i cannot wait to see what sony does to outmatch the new video capable ipod nano .

just purchased this unit a few days ago after months of researching mp3 players  .

this is my first mp3 player so i really had nothing to compare  .

so far , the unit has exceeded my expectations  .

the feel of the unit , including the controls , is very solid  .

nothing cheap about it whatsoever  .

i is also looking at the new creative zen  .

it had more features for the money , but the case and controls were no where near the quality of the sony  .

all lightweight plastic  .

now for the sound and video quality  .

wow and wow  .

the sound quality is simply amazing  .

there are also several audio configuration settings you can mess with to really fine tune the audio to your liking  .

the interface is nothing fancy , but hey , when you are listening to music , who cares about flashy ui's  .

as for the video , i is pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to watch a video on this player  .

i could easily watch a half hour show , but maybe not a 2 hour show  .

all in all , this is a fantastic player  .

no regrets at all  .

i feel this is a much better value than the ipod nano .

this mp3 player is the best i have had so far  .

i have had 3 ipods and a zune , and they can not be compared to the amazing sound delivered by this new sony mp3 player  .

for those wanting a flash based player , this item is one of the smallest and more portable out there with an extremely bright and clear lcd display which allows for viewing videos on the go  .

to make it even better , sony did not go cheap , the player features a nice durable and well designed metal body , thats a bit taller than the new nano videos , not as wide and thick though  .

sony also includes a set of great ear buds , which are a lot better than those packed with any other player out there i is tempted to go with the other sony mp3 player , which has an fm tuner built in and is a bit smaller , but after comparing them , i think i rather have the one with the metal body , better sound and  .

2 bigger lcd  .

those of you that buy either of the new sony's will be amazed by the performance of this well built device , and will love it a whole lot more than any other device that has been introduced into the market i got the nano video a few weeks ago , that went on ebay already  .

compared to an ipod and itunes , sony has a nice user interface thats nicer than apple's , you'll have no scroll wheel to deal with , you get better audio quality , a brighter lcd , and in my opinion a much nicer design  .

you can use windows media , but i highly recommend using napster (which comes with the player)  .

napster is really close to the itunes interface and will allow you to purchase albums and songs you like or you can pay $15 a month for unlimited downloads  .

those of you buying this mp3 player over the others on the market as of now will be making a great choice and will absolutely love this machine .

it's an awesome move by sony and it's right on time  .

i think sony offering so much more than ipods and zune  .

first high quality earphones with better battery life and easy of use  .

also sound quality is realy awesome , must buy .

this walkman player could easily represent sonys comeback  .

it shows some steps forward in the companiess lost incentive to bring competitive products to the mp3 player marker , onces dominated by their walkmans this tiny player will offer you good storage for its size at 8gb and what we've come to expect from the company , 30 hours of battery life  .

it has a great design overall taking away that hold button and a nice user interface  .

the videos in the screen look really sharp to my amazement given the fact it is their first video walkman and has sufficient buttons to not want to scroll wheel through it  .

one plus about this walkman that is not a tradition of many companies is its headphones  .

it brings high quality headphones that make it by far the best sounding player out of the box  .

its also pocket    friendly player and best of all open source  .

you can just drag your music from many computers and have them come to you with no restrictions unlike that friend of ours ipod  .

personally though , i would have liked for them to just come out with a really nice software for it as it would make your music better organized and easier to manage  .

all in all , a great player and definitively something to consider over a fat nano  .

choose wisely .

ok    i won't go into significant detail here  .

many others have posted good reviews of this very good little player  .

it's basic (for today's market) but has extremely excellent sound quality (that's what it's all about) , fine software to adjujst the sound , a music search interface that's very easy to use , a good screen (i wo not be watching lawrence of arabia anytime soon) and the ability to just drag and drop music from your internal or external drive and the player  .

as i said above the earbuds are very good and do a nice job of isolating you from external noise  .

the bottom line , however , is that while doing lots of research on which would be the best player to buy i stumbled on these at a local chain store in which they were priced under $100  .

best price at the time , anywhere online , is $159 plus shipping  .

hmmmm  .

one for my son's birthday , one for my wife and    oh  .

one for me  .

having bought this player mostly based on ms france's review , i cannot say on the whole that i is misled this is your highway cruiser bike of a player ; finish is superb , luxurious , and sound quality is excellent  .

however , as in the aforementioned bike , it is practically impossible to handle in a sporting situation  .

hold it in your hand  .

do not ; i have already damaged the screen due to excess hand heat  .

hang it using the chassis    inbuilt loophole  .

using what  .

is there at least a miserable cord supplied  .

so , off we go hunting for cases and things , which are available in sonystyle  .

com , though i kick myself for doing sony's undone job of divulging the fact  .

on a player of this price and pretention at least one of the extra available goodies should come included does it sound good  .

it sounds spectacular compared to my previous sony 507 and my brother's ipod nano  .

musical is the adjective i would use ; listen to it for hours without fatigue  .

it's interesting ; it's what music is all about  .

mp3 enters the audiophile world  .

the closest thing that sounded so good is my old mission system , that cost proportionally more owing to a larger carcass it sounds good with the supplied ex082 phones , though i took ms france up on her veiled suggestion and bought the shure 530  .

as in most things the benefit/investment graph drops off radically to near flat after the initial bargain rise  .

meaning , are the shures worth the extra  .

they're not  .

they sound good , yes , but turn the mid up a notch on the sony phones and the volume up a few notches and you get the 530 sound  .

clarity , detail etc are marginally better on the shures  .

it just depends how extravagant you are  .

i also suggest you click on on all the sound options  .

that will provide you with the clear detailed sound i have described  .

however if i may be so bold to ask , could all the bypass options and available sound modulations not be substituted for a line    out 30 pin port (which the democratic ipod has  .

would that not save some in production  .

or is sony still so obsessed about the proprietary accesses  .

and just to round this off , be warned , it still 'interacts' with you ; it flashes 'see you later' when you power off  .

how tacky can you get  .

but yes , it sounds great  .

the world will now see that sony still has the power  .

i own three sony mp3 players and one apple ipod nano  .

i only use the nano on driving trips so i keep the battery charged  .

my latest sony is the nws7006f , which is about the size of a cigarette lighter , has the same tough build of the one in this column , but also has a clock alarm , fm tuner , an exercise timer and it has a 50 hours battery life (i'ved tested it and it makes it easily) glad to see they have a good video model without sonicstage , because now i will buy one  .

oh yes , they have an s series which looks like this one and it does have an fm tuner , the screen is 1  .

8 inches though yeah , sony , i'm getting that s model .

sound quality is worthy for the money , but sacrificing some extra features .

it's really is annoying when you have this great mp3 device in your pants pocket and the stupid cable to your earbuds pulls them out because it is a foot too short  .

all    in    all this is a very worth while purchase  .

good pick jasmine/cnet .

if music is your main concern you cannot go wrong .

great player , but it's compatibility it skewed toward sony's connect  .

com  .

both sony and rhapsody confirmed it is not compatible with rhapsody to go  .

disappointing .

while sony has not done anything that screams cool in the market for a long long time , this is certainly a step in the right direction  .

one look at it , and you still think    busy inteface , but it's actually ok to use when in your hand  .

the one i used at best buy is ok , but nowhere near as easy to use as an ipod  .

i'm thinking this is a 6 by hardware alone  .

knowing sony though , it could drop a point or two when you load up the software .

as a long time user of creative products with realplayer music , i am amazed at the design quality of the nwz line of walkmans  .

the sound quality is superb however , the provided sony media manager tool is amateurish and clumsy which forces me to user windows media player for manage the walkman  .

it may be my inexperience with wmp but after two days i am still struggling with the interface  .

also , simple things like playing music from within a playlist just does not seem to work ; the entire catalog of music plays even when i instruct it to play just a single playlist finally , the transfer rates are abysmally slow  .

a sample package of five news items picked off the internet take less than a minute to transfer to my creative zen in mp3 format and they take a good 15 minutes to transfer to the sony if i'd known the management tools were so bad , i would not have purchased the unit  .

i'm hoping that it's my own inexperience with the tools that causes me the problems and that i'll get better with experience  .

that said , these days if i'm fighting the tool then it's not a very good tool .

just see the pros and cons , i think it's enough .
