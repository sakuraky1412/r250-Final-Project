he/PRP confirmed/VBD that/IN the/DT building/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB heated/VBN or/CC cooled/VBN and/CC they/PRP use/VBP heat/NN at/IN night/NN and/CC cold/JJ during/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP in/IN the/DT midst/NN of/IN appealing/VBG their/PRP$ owner/NN to/TO update/VB the/DT rooms/NNS ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT front/JJ desk/NN encounter/NN was/VBD most/RBS likely/JJ due/JJ to/TO a/DT language/NN barrier/NN ./.

i/LS replied/VBD to/TO his/PRP$ email/NN offering/VBG a/DT couple/NN of/IN suggestions/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN a/DT sign/NN informing/VBG guests/NNS about/IN their/PRP$ odd/JJ climate/NN control/NN system/NN and/CC also/RB mentioning/VBG that/IN we/PRP had/VBD cool/JJ air/NN at/IN night/NN when/WRB we/PRP started/VBD our/PRP$ stay/NN ./.

the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT rooms/NNS and/CC the/DT lack/NN of/IN hospitality/NN of/IN the/DT front/JJ desk/NN staff/NN are/VBP more/RBR like/IN a/DT locally/RB owned/VBN and/CC managed/VBN motel/NN ,/, do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB any/DT quality/NN assurances/NNS normally/RB provided/VBN by/IN an/DT international/JJ chain/NN known/VBN for/IN high/JJ standards/NNS ./.

i/LS went/VBD to/TO the/DT front/JJ desk/NN staff/NN and/CC was/VBD told/VBN that/IN the/DT air/NN condition/NN was/VBD turned/VBN off/RP and/CC the/DT whole/JJ system/NN was/VBD on/IN a/DT heating/NN system/NN .../: so/IN every/DT night/NN we/PRP slept/VBD with/IN the/DT sliding/VBG glass/NN door/NN open/JJ -/: our/PRP$ sleep/NN interrupted/VBN by/IN the/DT occasional/JJ late/JJ night/NN scooter/NN on/IN the/DT road/NN ,/, a/DT conversation/NN in/IN the/DT courtyard/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT one/CD night/NN when/WRB a/DT fly/NN decided/VBD to/TO roam/VB around/IN the/DT room/NN because/IN the/DT sliding/VBG glass/NN door/NN does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB a/DT screen/NN ./.

about/IN mid-way/NN through/IN of/IN the/DT stay/NN ,/, the/DT climate/NN control/NN would/MD only/RB provide/VB heat/NN even/RB when/WRB the/DT setting/NN was/VBD on/IN ``/`` cool/JJ ''/'' ./.

when/WRB we/PRP started/VBD our/PRP$ stay/NN ,/, the/DT air/NN condition/NN worked/VBD fine/JJ and/CC kept/VBD the/DT room/NN comfortable/JJ during/IN the/DT day/NN and/CC night/NN ./.

i/LS interacted/VBD with/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN their/PRP$ front/JJ desk/NN behind-the-counter/NN staff/NN and/CC each/DT time/NN they/PRP seemed/VBD annoyed/JJ ./.

the/DT temperature/NN outside/NN was/VBD very/RB pleasant/JJ for/IN november/NNP ,/, but/CC the/DT room/NN would/MD heat/VB up/RP because/IN of/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN sun/NN exposure/NN ./.

in/IN regards/VBZ to/TO the/DT staff/NN ,/, the/DT concierge/NN ,/, bellhops/NNS and/CC gym/NN staff/NN are/VBP very/RB hospitable/JJ and/CC top-notch/JJ ./.

however/RB ,/, the/DT front/JJ desk/NN staff/NN could/MD be/VB more/RBR hospitable/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ guests/NNS ./.

which/WDT made/VBD me/PRP feel/VB like/IN i/FW was/VBD imagining/VBG the/DT first/JJ couple/NN of/IN days/NNS when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD cooling/VBG the/DT room/NN ./.

as/IN many/JJ have/VBP shared/VBN ,/, the/DT rooms/NNS need/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN improvement/NN ./.

she/PRP was/VBD unapologetic/JJ and/CC unconcerned/JJ when/WRB i/FW told/VBD her/PRP that/IN we/PRP had/VBD a/DT different/JJ experience/NN ./.

after/IN a/DT 6/CD night/NN stay/NN ,/, i/FW agree/VBP with/IN what/WP many/JJ have/VBP said/VBN about/IN this/DT hotel/NN ./.

the/DT toilet/NN flush/NN was/VBD too/RB strong/JJ -LRB-/-LRB- as/IN in/IN ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD get/VB splashed/VBN -RRB-/-RRB- while/IN the/DT shower/NN water/NN pressure/NN was/VBD weak/JJ ./.
