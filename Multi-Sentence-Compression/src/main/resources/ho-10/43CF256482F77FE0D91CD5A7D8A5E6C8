i strongly advise requesting a room on 10th or 11th floors not facing the street , but unfortunately no guarantees that the hotel will honour this request .
the hotel is excellent in many ways - in a really convenient location for everything in sydney ( maximum 15 minutes walk to all the main sights , shopping , convention centre ) , nicely styled art deco , friendly staff , excellent buffet breakfasts ( western and oriental options ) , spotless , well-equipped rooms with tea and coffee making facilities and extremely comfortable beds .
several of my colleagues , staying for the same period but having made no `` quiet '' request , were given rooms on the 10th and 11th floors , not street-facing .
i was kept awake the entire saturday night by rowdy drinkers on the street below my window , and every other night was woken up between 3 and 4 am by garbage and recycling trucks .
i repeated the request on check in , and was given a room on 5th floor ( of 11 ) and facing onto the street .
the aircon was so cold that several of us had to stand around the periphery of the room in order to avoid the jets of freezing air on our heads and shoulders , which were so powerful as to be painful .
i am a very light sleeper and e-mailed the hotel to request a high , quiet room in advance .
wifi - free in just about every other hotel i have stayed in ( even cheap backpacker hostels in south america ) , wifi costs an exorbitant $ 11 per hour or $ 25 per day at the grace .
on checking out , the receptionist asked how my stay was - on telling her , the response was `` oh , so sorry about that , would you like to register for our frequent stayer programme ?
for two days of the conference , our group hired a meeting room in the hotel .
