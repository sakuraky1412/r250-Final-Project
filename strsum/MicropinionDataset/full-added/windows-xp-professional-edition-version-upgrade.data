why are people dissing windows xp and going for mac os x  .
boo  .
i hate macs and never liked them  .
plus microsoft tought about windows xp before mac os x is introduced  .
they just sold it after mac os x  .
i've used all the windows from 3 , 3  .
5 and up and xp is the top runner , i'm completely at home with this cricket .
i upgraded to xp pro last month and it's great  .
i'm a windows professinal and finally have a super os in my machine  .
every windows user has to try out this beauty  .
i'll give a thousand thumbs up for windows xp pro .
this is great , a must have for everyone  .
ignore people who say this os is rubbish thats totally untrue  .
i love this os  .
its so fast  .
my computer boots in like 40 secs  .
and its features r so awsome  .
this is the os to get  .
yes , finally an operating system i'm happy with  .
as a computer scientist , i've yearned for a pc operating system that is stable  .
tired of the os locking up in an app , this verion of windows is super  .
bill , you finally got it right  .
worth the money , folks  .
great features and stability .
windows xp (pro) has so many advantages over other operating systems  .
its official , 400 million people all over the word are using windows 9x and above  .
15 million for macos and 14 million for linux  .
what do the numbers say to you  .
in my opinion , they say that the consumer has made a choice .
i love the streamlined performance of windows xp  .
this program is so much better than windows me  .
that program froze all the time , but this new os is so much smoother  .
hoody hoo  .
i have been using windows xp rc 2 , its working fine no problems or crashes so far  .
great software  .
xp is the best version of windows yet  .
easier , faster , smarter , it's just better in everyway ; except windows product activation  .
i have not had any crashes , any hangups , no restarts  .
the luna interface is beautiful  .
it's just great .
xp pro is very stable , loads apps fast , is user friendly , works with virtually all hardware these days , and has remote desktop feature which alone is enough incentive to buy xp pro .
this is the most stable of any windows os i have loaded onto my home pc  .
but please follow the step by step recommendations for the upgrade , which is what i did from dell , or you will find yourself in a world of hurt  .
so far the upgrade has been worth it from win me to xp pro , but it is touch and go at first  .
get as clean a configuration as you can prior to upgrading  .
otherwise there will be issues .
xp never hangs on our pc  .
it's done everything i've asked it to  .
as an old dos user (and every windows version to date) , i'm impressed .
came pre    installed on my new pc , but did the upgrade on my previous pc  .
definitely more stable and more robust , though compatibility with older apps (especially my wife's vpn software for her office) is non    existent , and installing caused other issues that were quickly resolved by setting restore points (an excellent feature)  .
also beware that some functionality for familiar nt users is a little less obvious  .
9 out of 10 .
i dont know english language very well and you can fell it  .
i just can say about xp  the best and complete windows that i saw  .
i installed it into my system for 30 days and i dont see one error in it  .
perfect and fun_beautiful  .
best microsoft os i've had since going back to windows 3  .
so far found nothing to complain about .
super stable , very easy to use and work with , looks great although i prefer to strip out the graphics and run it in plain vanilla mode  .
i've got friends who're running it (home edition) and are having nothing but trouble , but i've been using the pro edition for 6 months and i love it  .
i suspect maybe my friends are not taking full advantage of all of the trouble    shooting options available to them  .
there is an issue with independent software vendors not having caught up to xp yet in many cases .
i've been an ms drone for a long time , not that i'm proud of it , but that's the way it is  .
xp finally got it all right  .
it's stable (xp has yet to crash on its own other vendors software still do on rare occasions) and makes my box feel about three times faster than win98se did  .
everything is prettier , faster , smoother and the filesystem arch  .
makes more sense than it ever has in windows  .
aside from that , the administration features are much easier to use than win2k and plug 'n' pray is ovbiously an improvement from nt  .
kudos to the greedy sons    of    guns in redmond .
i like the look and ease of use the annoying login screen is easily disables and the overall performance is great  .
yea windows xp has some negative effects such as incompatible software/hardware  .
but if you've got a decent computer with fairly new software/hardware then theres no problem at all  .
this is a very stable os and is great for gammers  .
my games have never ran so fast  .
yes i had some compatibility issues in the begining but i cleared that up soon with updated drivers  .
if your looking for a good stable os , then xp is for you  .
whether you play games , surf the net , or do business work  .
xp has it all for you , and is very reliable  .
i would rate xp atleast 8 or 9 out of 10  .
deffinetly worth the buy , but you should check out your computer first for any compatibility issues that may arrise .
this is without a doubt , the company's best os yet  .
but it takes some patience to get it running near it's potential  .
expect an extremely stable platform when compared to win95/98    no more blue screens here  .
expect also to spend a few days setting everything up to get all of your peripherals and applications to work  .
many hardware drivers are unsupported by the native software  .
(no dvd driver ; many cdr/w products unsupported , particularly hp  .
) the 'annoyances' folks talk about abound , but aren't really that bad  .
the  .
net system used by microsoft does attempt to run your life online , but it won't if you do not let it    and it's actually more convenient than annoying  .
online support is a little shaky  .
though they are quick to respond (a day or two max) , the support folks draw a very fine line between free support and support they charge you for  .
if you decide to spend $200 to upgrade to xp    pro , be ready       download the newest software drivers for all of your peripherals  .
and if there's a piece of hardware or software that you cannot live without , then wait until an updated xp driver comes along , or go spend more money on an xp supported device  .
all in all , the stability alone is worth the upgrade .
microsoft acutally did a good job this time  .
the new gui is a refreshing new look , especially after seeing the same desktop for 6 years  .
to mac addiats who cannot seem to help themselfs at calling this a rip    off , if you actually wanted productivity , compatibility , and a wide range of products , you would be useing a pc  .
its pc user's faults that you mis    invested your money into an imac  .
windows xp is great , and a must get update .
one word summarizes why i like xp   stability  .
it's built on win2k's architecture and it shows  .
i've been running rc1 for a month now and haven't seen the slightest hiccup  .
too bad ms has to tout all the multimedia bells and whistles that 90% of us won't use while many people would switch if only they were told your computer wo not crash anymore  .
i guess that would be an admission of fault on microsoft's part for putting out the horrendous win9x series  .
if you're running win2k happily then there's not much need to upgrade  .
i've also run linux systems for the past 4 years and have become used to stable os's  .
with xp , the home user finally has a stable wintel option  .
finally , i agree with some reviewers that the gui still lags behind mac osx .
wow , for once i'm impressed by what's rolled out of redmond , wa  .
i had fears of upgrading , but they've proved me wrong  .
now as mac fanatics have been saying (and are right) , the os gui is a cheap knock    off of macos x  .
oh well , i own a mac too , i don't care , just as long as windows is stable    thats all i care about i have not seen such a great upgrade since windows 3  .
this truely is a great improvement congrats ms .
just like tony the tiger said its greeeaat  .
easy to install thanx to the upgrade advisor , super easy to network it plays games well and its stable  .
i've been using windows since version 1  .
and using old dos before that  .
and i can say this this is the most stable , reliable os microsoft has made to date  .
currently i'm running win xp pro on 3 desktops and 1 laptop  .
it couldnt have been easier to network all these  .
i did find a couple bugs in the os tho , one being that the build in drivers for my video card caused my video card not to work in opengl  .
all i did is download the drivers from my vid card manuf  .
web site and it works flawlessly now  .
i spend about 2 days crashing the system (as i always do to any os that i use) and i could only crash it about 6% of the time  .
even when it did crash , i only had to reboot the machine once  .
this is amazing compared to windows 9x machines where it would be up around 73%  .
even win2kpro i could crash about 22% of the time  .
some of the new features , i could do without , and it does lack some features i can use , but the stability , reliablity , and security certinly make up for it  .
i still think ms still has a way to go to catch up to bsd and unix (and even mac os x even tho i dont really like macs) , but for a consumer os that everyone is used to , this is a great os  .
maybe ms should follow mac and integrate bsd into there os hrmm what and idea  .
i started my experience with the beta2 preview  .
since that time , i have had no more blue screens    and that is form a win2k upgrade  .
the speed is great on my pii    400  .
i have even gotten use to the new look    and    feel .
i have been using this from the beta program beta 1 and i really cannot believe this is a microsoft product  .
the only stuff that crashes on me are dumb programs that were not written to support xp (yet  .
) and this happens very little  .
really happy with it  .
running the evaluation version , going to buy it as soon as sp1 is available (or my trial period is up , whichever comes first) .
works well , took a very long time to install and every so often , (too often) it tells me my password has to be changed or is about to expire  .
i don't have a windows password  .
and i do not want one , but it's very hard to get around the password notice .
i have been a devotee of win 2k pro since i went through much pain and blue screen with win 98 and me  .
2k pro has been bulletproof , but not as user friendly as i would have liked  .
xp pro has proved to be very user friendly , easy to use and supports my numerous peripherals and home network without me needing to go hunting for drivers etc  .
my experience is a seamless upgrade from win 2k to xp pro .
love it and hate it  .
spend lots of time downloading drivers for printer scanner camera etc very little info at computer stores .
all the mac peeps are getting angry , but for people like me who use both mac and pc and do not go under the hood too much , this operating system seems great so far  .
i've been only using it a few hours now but i like it better than my previous win98se .
i bought win me with my computer in july  .
i have been mad since it crashed way too much and even got corrupted when i installed the max payne demo  .
then it is a payne to fix  .
i just got xp pro on it and i think it rocks  .
windows 9x/me is a terrible series of operating systems  .
if you're considering the upgrade , i would highly recommend it , but if you're running windows 2000 , you won't get much besides a faster boot  .
the new gui is pretty nice , though it takes some getting used to  .
i am definitely glad that the microsoft bashers wo not be able to complain about the stability of windoze (finally  .
) compete all you want on features and application support , but stability is now just as good with windows as it is with unix  .
thank god  .
here it is from a fairly experienced windows and os/2 user  .
i had windows 2000 pro and it is great and rock solid  .
i migrated my pc to xp (no dual boot) and setup failed a couple of times due to incompatible programs such as the nortel vpn client  .
finally i got the install going and it said it would take 61 minutes  .
the copyright protection appeared and asked if i wanted to register and unprotect it now  .
i chose yes but the system could neither find my cable modem nor my dial up connection  .
hence , i had to skip that part  .
it appeared to be finished after 45 minutes but the machine seemed frozen after i logged in and the task bar items loaded  .
i hit ctl+alt+del and nothing happened  .
i decided to wait it out  .
eventually it recovered  .
the first thing i noticed is what i thought is a ton of constant disk caching  .
that turned out to be disk keeper defrag running as a service in the background  .
i disabled that and the drive noise problem went away  .
i rebooted the pc and when it came up this time it recognized my internet connection via the cable modem and i unprotected the product  .
i really wanted to get used to the new gui , but eventually got frustrated by it and chose to disable as much of it as possible in the display and special effect settings  .
xp takes a little getting used to but the audio and video playback is much improved  .
the only caution is my system has frozen a couple of time , but it may be a configuration issue  .
one other issue is the user logon  .
i had to change it from the default to what it appears under windows 2000 in order to access my administrator account and have certain functionality like locking the workstation instead of logging out  .
overall i recommend upgrading for all home users , business may want to take a wait and see strategy .
i'm having driver problem since i upgrade it driver  .
tel hsp56k micro modem  .
professional series , like anything that is not compatible with windows xp professional .
it looked grim the first five minutes after installation , but the one glitch i've had with windows xp is due to an old video card driver that had since been upgraded  .
now , after a week of thorough testing at this product more objectively , i can see the improvements  .
most importantly , this os is much more stable in my experience  .
i've tested it while editing video (one of the more stressful things you can do to an os  .
) this baby passes with flying colors  .
this easily beats win2000 , which had no registry restoration feature and a sad joke for file system protection  .
the interface improvements are very reminiscent of a mac , but it's not like apple created the gui universe , or even kept clear of microsoft's feature set  .
anything to make an interface more pleasing and usable is welcome  .
take special attention to the cleartype font smoothing , which is so worth it that it could have been sold in its own box  .
of course , it's not all blind praise ; windows product activation is such a scary prospect that i would even refuse to use a product with this or anything like it embedded  .
i don't want to risk having my work locked inside my own computer one morning for no reason  .
of course , i use the xp professional corporate edition , so i have not seen it happen yet  .
i'm recommending this thing to my friends       but only after i check out their hardware and software configurations .
attention deficit disorder tends to take multi    tasking to new levels of complexity  .
for years , i've been daring my isps not to crash in the face of my obsessive need to open as many windows as i can keep track of (a lot  .
) in as many different browsers as possible  .
during the last 2 months i've been running windows xp , not even aol has buckled  .
(well , ok it did once but i is changing my desktop settings while i is smart    downloading 3 or four differnt files ) xp seems to operate more logically than its forerunners  .
and i know this because i'm working more logically  .
i have no icons on my desktop anymore (which is why i felt an urge to decorate)  .
instead , programs and pull    up menus can open , close , and remain available right on the task and tool bars at the bottom of the screen  .
no need to close windows to shift functions  .
all of a sudden , personal and web    based functions are logically integrated in just a few square feet of my desk  .
even if the colors and graphics are still micro    hideous , you cannot help but appreciate the astute practicality of the design .
with a spiffy new gui , and a few perks many users are asking if xp is worth it  .
yes it is , stability and speed have been upgraded  .
new features and easier navigation make learning the new os easy  .
anyone just getting into computers will find xp to be a major asset  .
however , for advanced users the firewall is a joke , security could still be an issue with this os  .
i found it to still be very easy to find back doors in around the security  .
the pro versions options for a business are deffinatly somethign to consider , from 98 or me its a vast improvment  .
i would recommend this for anyone with 98 or me , however 2000 users hold on to your shorts until gold comes out  .
a lot of the nagging pop ups , and lockdowns should be resolved by then  .
overal this os is great for people new to computers , to advanced users i'd stick to win2000 .
i is born a windows user  .
in europe you will never see a mac , and nobody knows about unix  .
my first computer is a pc dual booted with win 98 fe and win nt 4  .
i got fed up with the hundreds of crashes and failures of the windows platform  .
i is afraid to push the on (off button because something might explode lol  .
because i moved to canada , i had the opportunity to test lots of operating sistems (i had to because windows is simply driving me crazy)  .
microsofts software can be defined in this way   cheap but expensive (it is cheap made but very expensive to buy) and that is becoming to be a tradition  .
i wnt through all of them  .
from win 95 , to 98 then me , 2000 , and xp  .
so this are the results   because win 95 98 and me are based on the same platform , they are going through the same crashes and failuires  .
win 2000 and xp are based on somthing else and that gives them some stabiity but still (the ms reputation)  .
so i finally upgraded to xp to see the innovation (of cource dual booted with redhat linux 7  .
the installation is 25 minutes (it is telling me that it would take it one hour at the beginning)  .
win xp makes an impression with the look more than the tools  .
the usual worpad and other things are the same as in the previous versions  .
the new look is very idiotic and dumb because the frames are so big that makes my 17 inch monitor look like a 15 inch one  .
so i changed the skin to the tipical win98 skin  .
i find xp as stable as 2000 ( it froze only once in 3 weeks )  .
in gaming it is a lot faster than me or 98 @loading times  .
but when i is playing aquanox , sometimes it just exit (making me to lose a mission)because of the win updates agreement etc  .
another thing is that my computer icon dissapered just like that (like    .
) and i had to make a shortcut to my desktop  .
and now about the drivers , i do not know why some stupid people complain about xp does not have the drivers for the sound card or other devices because they must be prepared with all the drivers that come on cds for their hardware  .
in my case , xp does not support the nvidia capture drivers for my gf4 ti , the same happend with millenium and others  .
another thing that i do not like is the microsoft messenger that comes with xp  .
it is so annoing when you can not use it because you really need to make a  .
net passport  .
i do not need that and after a time of refuzes from my side , the program let me to use it withought a  .
net whatever  .
but one thing that i really like @ xp is the win media player 8  .
the sound quakity is way better than other versions or other mp3 players  .
overall it is an ok os but it could be better , and remember , it is not the impression and look that matters , it is the use of it  .
if you want to upgrade to xp , be prepared with your drivers , and be prepared for your old programs you are using , lots of them will not work and and they must be reinstalled  .
anyways , you can upgrade to xp when the user reviews will get better  .
if you upgrade , good luck and good drivers  .
in the mean time , i will start to search and know the linux secrets ( it is the only guaranteed way to stability and productivity ) peace  .
well since i'm running windows xp pro in a pentium ii    266 , i'd say the minimium requirements are a little above what's actually required .
too many features nobody will use , hence the low rating    which also affects quality  .
but it's stable , amazingly  .
not worth the high price as ms execs have told the public that windows 2000 (what xp is supposed to be) is incomplete and has also acknowledged win9x being buggy  .
with that in mind , should not xp be a really low $$$ price rather than a really high one  .
where else is one going to pay for bug fixes  .
that includes apple  .
that's why people need to look at linux .
okay i admit first off that i'm a unix/mac os x user so if you judge me by that then so be it  .
after installing the upgrade from windows 2000 pro and play with xp for awhile i wonder why anybody would pay 200 bucks for this  .
granted its a fine os and works good but 200 bucks for an upgrade to what  .
i've got a prettier interface (some say) and a few features that i'll never use  .
give me a break  .
i thought this is going to be a breakthough for ms  .
oh well .
if you use windows 2000 professional , forget abot this upgrade  .
i use windows 2000 at home , and wanted to upgrade to the xp home version  .
this is not possible , you have to pay $100 extra for the professional upgrade  .
this is crazy , and i regret upgrading  .
comparing to mac os x , windows has a long way to go  .
i think xp main focus is to have futuristice look as a competitive to mac osx  .
i really think if anyone who are using windows 2000 pro  .
or me like myself , should hold on until you really sure if the xp is worth your investment  .
if anyone is tire of looking at their boring windows' interface , i would highly recommend windowblinds  .
www  .
windowblinds  .
com for $50 you can fully customize your windows to look like osx , xp , and etc  .
plus you can design your own interface  .
so we do not have to spend $200 just to buy a colorful user    interface .
if your new to computers , then fine ; windows xp is your only choice  .
i is previously using windows 2000 , and can easily say i is happier with it in ever conceivable way with the possible exception of the gui , which gets annoying fast anyways  .
windows xp crashes once ever 2 days , even without installed drivers that xp did not support  .
my eyes ache from seeing a microsoft logo on some part of my screen at all times  .
this product is too branded , unstable , and simply a headache for power users  .
70% of computer users do not know better , that is a statistical fact ; they're happy chatting on the bundled msn messenger while listening to they're brittany spears cd on the windows media player  .
microsoft takes advantage of the publics lack of apathy , and creates a quality that only goes skin deep  .
given the amount of recourses the microsoft corporation has , i consider this an embarrassment to them  .
this product is garbage  .
i'm returning it tomorrow , and installing 2000 or linux .
oh my god , microsoft cannot do anything on their own  .
nice looking interface , but too bad you could not have come up with the idea on your own  .
it does not run well in a network environment  .
incompatible with win2000 server (contrary to microsofts claim)  .
strange problems running ms office .
scanner stopped working because xp can not initialize it even though the scanner is compatable and is running great with xp  .
cordless mouse is lost too  .
support tells me it is not their problem  .
it is hp's problem .
more crashes in xp on a new computer in one month than all previous versions combined  .
very expensive  .
nice looking interface when it's working and good multimedia components .
windows xp is just sad  .
the features suck , it's not as stable as 2000 , and it looks like a 3 year old designed it  .
if you want the best os microsoft has brought out then stick with 2000 pro  .
xp is a waste of time , money , and effort  .
also , their activation process is ridiculous  .
i have a laptop and a desktop and i'm not going to buy 2 copies so microsoft can get a little richer  .
besides , i bet there's a crack out there for xp it's just not worth it  .
stay away from xp .
as a private user i am very disapointed by microsoft's new soft  .
so little changes and no better stability  .
instead of crashing it sends error reports but the program and data are still lost  .
price is too expensive for only one pc (in belgium they sell the corp ed  .
for 450 usd  .
i'm swithching to linux  .
disgusting .
most of my hardware is incompatable with xp so i have re    installed linux and will keep microsoft way from my hardware  .
one of my friends got a computer recently with xp installed and the thing sucks  .
she called me down to help set it up , but its horrible  .
i dont know what i did wrong , but it crashed more than my version of 98  .
maybe im expecting to much , but maybe ms could put out a descent product  .
the windows operating system always seems to be way behind the mac when it comes to new and innovative features  .
the mac is first with usb , firewire , wireless , dvd , etc  .
it's hard to believe the microsoft monopoly has brainwashed me for so many years thinking it is the best computer platform  .
with max os x now available , i think it is about time to make the switch  .
this is the most pathetic and blatant attempt i have ever seen from m$ to steal more of their consumer's money  .
i actually thought ms might have finally been able to break its mold and come out with a decent os  .
wow is i wrong  .
it's an insult to apple to say windows xp is a copy of macos x  .
maybe if they invested some money into actually improving their os instead of taking more money they may come up with a halfway decent os someday .
what i have works  .
i ai not being an idiot  .
i have my money in my pocket  .
sorry bill , you cannot have it .
of course microsoft stole the interface and name (pretty muchly) from mac osx  .
why would not they  .
that seems to be all they do since the very beggining  .
as i have said before  .
this product really shows a big weakness on microsoft's part  .
since when have they been the ones who try to make an os that looks good  .
no , they have always made the functional , good working , robust os  .
albeit complex and sometimes impossible to use , you simply just can not beat windows 98 or even 95 for the above characteristics  .
i almost fell on the floor when i heard about xp and saw what it looked like  .
truly a wannabe mac os system  .
truth is , they will never catch up with mac by trying to make a system that simply looks like it  .
it's gotta work too  .
and by creating a os of this type , i belive , not only will it not perform up to the current expectations of 98 and 2000 users , but will in a sense , bring microsoft down as a whole  .
for their entire purpose in creating a good os , will be lost  .
changing the interface of windows 2000    does not constitute a reason to upgrade an already poorly design os  .
if you truly want a rock solid os , go with any flavor of unix  .
or if you would still prefer a great interface (superior to microsoft's)    and with the strongest os backbone around (unix) go with apple's new 10  .
everything that everyone is praising has been around since os 7  .
go with the new os x or even better the new 10  .
1 release  .
if you have not noticed    microsoft not only stole the interface of mac os but the name too .
