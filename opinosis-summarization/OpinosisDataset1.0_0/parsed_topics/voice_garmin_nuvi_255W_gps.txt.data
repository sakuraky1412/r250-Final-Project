  the voice prompts and maps are wonderful especially when driving after dark .

i also thought the the voice prompts of the 750 where more pleasant sounding than the 255w's .

 the 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .

 i didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .

some of the voices are annoying .

 my understanding is that garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .

 i like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .

 the quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .

the text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the garmin put out for the 255w the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .

 i note that a competitor is coming out with a homer simpson version of the gps voices .

i wish that the gps had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .

first i want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, i personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .

some of the negatives that were mentioned that i did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   the possible list could go on and on but i think you get the idea .

 the voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, i read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but i have no problem   .

 the text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .

 you have your choice of several languages and voices .

 also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the garmin site .

 for instance, you can change the voice of the gps .

the voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .

 at volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .

 it seems to be caused by garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .

 on previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100

 its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .

 many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .

 other than the magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .

the most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .

 and the voice and streets match perfectly .

 the female voice   is much clearer than jack, the male american english .

 i couldn't understand the australian or english voices, but samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .

 the screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .

 when the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .

 it seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .

 the voices seem too robotic .

 however, i much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .

 everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the tts mode .

 so i called garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .

 i bought the 255w and the voice was tinny and soft .

 voice commands were mechanical but clear .

 i had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .

 a clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .

 the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the tts voice .

 the user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .

the voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .

the default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so i never even tried any of the alternative voices .

i like being able to select different voices, however when i am using daniel with the english accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .

the voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .

not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .

 this is a big help as i was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure i was make correct turns when in buffalo .

 often when i'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .

 i have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .

 i had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .

 i also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, i plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .

 the screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .

 there are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even australian, american and british english .

i agree that the sound isn't great for the tts voice but it's definitely audible and i like it over all .

 the non tts voice is more pleasant .

 the only complaint that i have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .

 you can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .

 the voice prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the gps, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the gps with a touch of the screen .

the unit worked well and i had no issue with the voice as i had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .

 i switched over to the male voice which i happen to like better .

the screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .

under the services link on the garmin site look for the goodies section and the garmin garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .

 the only complaint i have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .

 the voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .

 the voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .

 the voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .

the voice is clear and easy to understand .

 since my near vision isn't very good i like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .

0 out of 5 stars no jill voice on this one !

i rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .

 all the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new samantha voice really sucks big time .

 what they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .

 if you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .

i'm really glad i bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .

 map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .

the voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .

 the voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .

 several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .

 from reviews, i thought there might only be one voice .

 the pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .

 after ample research   i selected the nuvi 255w for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .

voice activation did stop working & then came back in german ,  just changed it back english & has been working well since then .

 love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .

others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .

 i must say, though, that i believed it would have a certain cachet to use the british english female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .

the voice commands are excellent and timely .

 the model 255w that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .

 the voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .
