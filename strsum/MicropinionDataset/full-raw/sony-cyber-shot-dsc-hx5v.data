i love these features in this camera  .
i love this camera  .
as time ticks by with this camera in my pocket , i'm learning what it can do  .
it really takes some nice pictures right out of the box  .
with a little practice it takes phenomenal pictures under all sorts of situations  .
thanks , sony  .
auto modes are amazing for those of us without a ton of photgraphic talent  .
color accuracy is awesome    love the pictures it takes of my extremely fair daughter  .
a significant testament to this camera's attributes is that the camera is now $30 more at the camera store at which i bought the hx5  .
normally prices go straight down .

comparison prior to purchase    .
i reviewed over 50 web sites , spoke to camera stores and had the specifications reviewed by photographic professionals  .
the web sites i reviewed gave mixed reviews but in general this camera came out one of the best point and shoot cameras  .
in fact many of the complaints i read were by people comparing the camera with high end slr  .
s or dslr  .
s clearly not an unbiased or practical test , in my opinion a device should be compared with products in the same class to be fair  .
i spoke to most of the major and many other camera stores that carried various brands that were familiar with this camera all of them stated they did not have a point and shoot better than this camera  .
some stated the camera is as good as some slr  .
s and some pointed out the lens and the cmos image sensor is the same as that found on high end dslr  .
s test results    .
indoor camera mode   camera tested in the auto mode , photographed people and pets  .
tested under natural light , incandescent and fluorescent lights all shots were clear and sharp  .
camera tested in a darkened room in auto mode flash worked picture quality is excellent  .
extreme test    camera tested in an almost completely dark room with light seeping through a window blind , picture blurry    camera had trouble adjusting due to streaks of light coming through blind outdoor camera mode  .
camera tested in auto mode  .
, photographed people and pets pictures were clear and sharp  .
the camera compensated for my movements , people moving and animal movement even when using zoom at its maximum without a tripod  .
photographed a man made waterfall you could actually see the water streaming down the rock  .
photographed several high trees all came out straight , even a palm tree (my results contradict the finding of another users results) movie mode   (inside and outside)  .
photographed people and animals playing inside and outside , a man made waterfall , a television program  .
camera adjusted to my movements and gave clear and crisp movies  .
sounds were accurate and clear viewing    .
the camera has a 3  .
lcd display  .
i had no problem seeing what i photographed even in sunlight software    .
the camera includes software that allows you to save your pictures as data , wmv , hd and standard mode  .
all modes worked well conclusion   as far as i am concerned this camera is better than any point and shoot on the market  .
i agree with a lot of the professionals that stated it is almost as good as a slr or dslr when used by the average user  .
even in the auto mode it excelled in many difficult situations both as a fixed camera and movie camera  .
due to the camera size you have to be careful not to block the microphone on the top of the camera  .
if you are a professional photographer this camera is probably not for you though i did talk to one professional photographer that stated they used this camera as a backup at a wedding and the pictures came out as good as their high end cameras in many situations  .

i am an above average lay photograher that has taken more than a 1000 pictures of people , alaskan landscapes , and action shots with this camera  .
it is an easy    to    use camera with many useful and readily available options  .
my learning curve in using it is quite short , but i have not used the movie , burst or gps options  .
alaskan shots taken from early morning through the day and after sunset are some of the best ever for me , and the panoramics are really special  .
i have used the anti    motion blur setting to take some shots that would not be possible with most point and shoot digital cameras  .
i plan to have this fun and quality camera for a long time  .
the amount of features are incredible and the best part about them are the fact that the results come out as they were designed to  .
settings such as one that will take a shot in twilight while not using a tripod , panoramic that actually works , and hdr shooting all are amazing features .
bottom line is get the settings right and this cam takes better than my d    5000  .
my favorite features are the panoramic and twilight modes they both work well and very simple to use some have complained about using the panoramic shots saying they had trouble i really dont see how it would be tough to use the video quality is very nice as well , but be careful because of the mic placement .
i have 2 dslrs but i always take this camera along for a couple of reasons   it gives me the gps coordinates of where i'm shooting and i can take a panorama of the entire scene  .
the panorama takes some practice and does somewhat distort the image but is really cool to have  .
i love this camera  .
feature    wise the hx5v is second to none in its category  .
but as a point    n    shoot , you have to know how some of the different settings work to get the most from this camera  .
it does have several manual speed , aperture and iso settings that you can adjust in manual modes  .
when i first got the camera i is amazed at how well it did indoors but disappointed with my outdoor pics  .
after spending a couple weeks with it and modifying some of the settings i am quite happy with my outdoor pics too  .
get a 16 or 32gb memory card as well .
nicely designed in black  .
panarama mode is even easier than i would have imagined  .
simply switch to that mode , hold the camera up and press the shutter button once move the camera across your scene  .
it snaps the photo segments and stitches them together  .
really simple and the results are impressive i did not get a chance to see the results on my own computer but the 3 display looked very impressive  .
definitely my next camera for travel  .
updated  .
on apr 22 , 2010  .
i have been using this camera for about 2  .
5 days and i've been very pleased  .
the blink detection works great  .
i have taken photos of my kids and dog and no images have been blurry it is extremely easy to use  .
the initial battery charge took about 2 hours  .
once that is ready i is snapping photos i use iphoto and is a bit concerned that it would give me problems but it is so simple  .
i simply plugged in the supplied transfer cable and turned it on  .
iphoto detected the camera instantly and gave me the option to upload my photos  .
i is concerned that the gps tagging would not work as the supplied disk specifies that it's for pcs only  .
i is happy to see that all my photos are geographically tagged though it has only been a few days i'm extremely pleased with this camera  .
it's a nice point and shoot that gives a crisp display and clear images  .
i'm happy with my purchase .
in short , i am happy with it so far , it's cheaper than the sd870 i bought for my mom and after some time learning all the features from the online manual and some trial and errors , i think i can take better pictures with it  .
i have been using canon powershot for the past years (s300 , sd300 , sd800) and would like to get something that can take better indoor pictures / videos in weddings and performances  .
i is looking for compact mega    zoom with decent low light performance and came across the hx5v  .
(tough choice between the sony and canon s210 , did not pick s210 because of it's zoom button and slower speed)  .
anyway , i got it in time for my kid's dance recital and both video and images , once know which mode to use , has been meeting my expectation  .
the pictures are somewhat on the soft side for the most part but i think that beats having excessive noise  .
there are more controls and different ways to capture images than my old canon's and i am actually enjoying exploring how i can get better pictures with this thingy  .
it's no dslr but i want something that's more portable and it's a nice upgrade for myself and my family for capturing the precious moments in the next few years to come check out some pics below if the link works  .

if you like super sharp pictures and want to fiddle with manual adjustments get another camera if you want excellent low light performance from a camera that makes very pleasing pictures (but soft , like a canon ixus on soft mode mainly an issue for pixel peepers)  .
that look great in print , with awesome features not found elsewhere  .
and the best panorama mode i�ve seen , ever  .
and to boot a compact camera that actually replaces that chunky video cam with full hd stereo videos , even in very low light conditions this is an excellent alternative  .
my personal worries about the lack of sharpness and manual control disappeared after seeing the final results in full resolution on a 50 lcd screen , it rocks  .
if i want to fiddle i    ll grab my dslr , for everything else , this does it .
i have 3 canon powershots (a540 , sd700is , sx10is) from reading past recommendations and i'm not overly happy with them  .
especially in low light  .
i also looked at this hx5v's main competitor , the pana tz10/zs7 and looks like it takes better photos and video  .
but the pana causes annoying light streaks on videos (see youtube) , which i would find irritating and unacceptable  .
also , i owned 2 pana camcorders that broke so reliability is in question  .
therefore , i chose sony this time around  .
especially since they decided to incorporate sd card usage  .
yay  .
my 8gb card can hold 1500 photos or approx  .
1 hour of 1080i video  .
perfect  .
no need to take my video camera on trips anymore  .
i've had it for 1  .
5 days and so far , am quite happy with the quality  .
i viewed photos and videos on my plasma tv and it's amazing  .
the avchd video format needs to be converted before you can edit them on your computer  .
i have both a mac and pc so i'm still playing around on both and looking for an easy method  .
the original mts file format is not recognized by imovie 08  .
you can shoot in a lower quality mp4 which imovie will recognize  .
also , if you have the sony dvdirect vrd6 , there's a firmware download on sony's website to accommodate burning avchd from a digital camera video such as this hx5v i recommend ordering an extra battery and 1    hour quick charger from ebay  .
standard charger takes 4+ hours  .
if you don't need the gps , turn it off to save battery power  .
some say the build quality is cheap but i do not find that to be the case  .
there is a metal band that wraps around from the top to the bottom to protect it  .
the battery cover may need a little softer touch but there are other cameras that sells itself as waterproof , shock    proof , etc so go buy them instead if you're clumsy and tend to drop things that's it for now  .
rating this sony a 4  .
5 stars  .
only because the avchd's mts video format is still difficult to edit updated  .
on jun 1 , 2010  .
i purchased this camera for my wife after reading sony's claims of its low light performance , in hopes of sparing our baby's vision from thousands of flashes  .
this camera has served its intended purpose and then some  .
i have truly been impressed with the quality of pictures this camera has taken and all the features packed into a farely tiny package  .
although the hd video quality may not be on par with my canon vixia , it is still of good quality and sound and comes in handy .
everyone talk about soft picture for this camera , but just remember you got that 10x wide angle zoom in a light compact body here if you want really sharp photo , get that panasonic lx3 with 2  .
5x zoom brought this camera right before our trip to alaska to complement my excellent panasonic lx3 , shoot over 12gb of hd video and photos in 9 days under the amazingly good weather .
overall i think this camera has most if not all the features the average user would want in a compact camera  .
this camera is definitely not for the 'prosumer or advance user  .
i have done a lot of searching and haven't been able to find anything that has the feature set that the hx5v has , i do not think there is a better all in one compact camcorder with these features .
given we were looking for a compact all in one solution (hd video regular) we really feel we received good value from this product so far  .
generally recommend it , but as indicated by another review the picture quality may not be up to par however i'm not sure if that might not be expecting too much from this tiny camera  .
time will tell .
i am a tenyer veteran of sony cameras and this is a new experience  .
there are mysterious holes in images occasionally  .
i've never experienced anything like this in an electronic camera  .
the holes appear as small black bullseye stains and show up on a small percentage (est  .
2%) of images  .
it is not related to the conditions (inside or outside , flash or not , temperature , setting , ) or any other variable that  .
over 4 , 000 images taken and i can not figure it out  .
i have to return the camera because i cannot live with the possiblity that a great shot will be ruined by something i do nto understand or can not control .
before release , this camera is touted as the holy grail it is not  .
the aforementioned low light shooting is bad enough , but there are other problems  .
the placement of the stereo mics on top of the camera exactly where anyone would hold a camera is downright stupid  .
the location of the flash in front is a problem too ; exactly where you might put your fingers on the front stupid  .
battery life is appalling  .
if you video hd , you can hear the camera making sounds as you record  .
the sound quality is for the birds  .
stupid  .
the buttons are difficult to find as they are flush with the camera surface and are also too small  .
the gps is ( for me ) useless  .
i do remember where i take photos and video  .
the panorama mode is downright silly  .
the overall picture quality though good , is not as sharp as i'd like them to be  .
the color saturation does not look accurate  .
all in all , the camera is not user friendly in too many ways  .
certainly not worth the $350 that sony is charging updated  .
on apr 14 , 2010  .
doesnt meet the sharpness i have in a sligtly larger olympus 750       i crop and enlarge my own pics , and quality is way off  .
where should i start many of my friends warned me against sony but did i listen  .
all the features are nice to have but the main purpose of a camera is pictures right  .
well , i is disappointed beyond comprehension  .
even without zoom , the basic things like faces are blurred and weird looking  .
i took about 300 pictures on a weeklong trip and all of them were blurry  .
i used the intelligent auto mode or something like that (the green setting) for all pictures  .
when viewed at full size the image quality is embarrassing  .
i have my old canon sd200 , gave it to my son to play with , he took some pictures of the same landscapes , in image clarity and overall quality we has a clear winner in sd200  .
i bought it from best buy and it  .
s outside the return window , i am stuck with the piece of junk for years now i read all the reviews and saw all the sample pictures on the web , not sure what i am doing wrong , i am not a expert photographer and do not wish to use anything besides the easy or auto mode and using those the image quality is very disheartening .
i would not recommend this camera  .
the camera cannot take a decent photo .
