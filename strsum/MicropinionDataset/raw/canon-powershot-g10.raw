Pros:. picture quality is spectacular. Solid. A Real camera, not plastic point and shoot. Versatile, flexible. 
Cons:. can't understand the manual. Limited flash range. rumor has it this is a noisy camera.. 
Summary:. I have owned 5 fuji's, including the legendary F30, an F40fd, and F200exr, plus a Nikon D40, and a Lumix FZ28.. The 200 &#38; D40 stand on their own. however, I bought the FZ28 as sort of an all around everything in one package camera. Great features, but after a trip to England I found the images simply didn't compare to my Fuji P &#38; S. Sorry. They just weren't as sharp, color wasn't as saturated, etc. Meanwhile, my girlfriend shows up with the G10, which I'd dismissed because of cost and reviews.. Well, a year later, I still have the girlfriend, and just sold the FZ28 and bought a G10. No questions asked, just plunked down the $450 and walked out.. There is simply no comparison with anything else I've owned or looked at. Maybe the Fuji is still the P&#38;S to have, and the intro D40 a good SLR tos tart with, but this G10 is so far superior to my former Lumix it isn't even funny. It's the kind of camera I'll plan a trip around just getting to use it.. Updated. on Dec 24, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Built like a tank. Tons of control, good lens, shoots raw. 
Cons:. Its expensive but what did you expect. 
Summary:. I was looking for a camera to take with me when my dslr just isn't possible. The G10 has filled that gap perfectly. The pictures look amazing. Some people will conplain about digital noise / artifacts but this is common in all point and shoots. If you set the iso to its lowest setting noise levels are just fine in my opinion. You can also shoot in raw or have it save a raw and a jpeg. The build quality is also as good as it gets. This thing is like a little black tank. Highly recommended!. 

$$;
Pros:. Wide angle lens, grear zoom (not better than G9), amazing noise reduction pictures with IS system, new picture system Digic IV, full of features, handle RAW+JPG formats.. 
Cons:. Is not a dSLR, but you can got G10 like backup camera for a dSLR (Canon EOS). Max Video resolution 640x480 at 30fps. 
Summary:. great camera, the price is just for that you buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, built strong. 
Cons:. nothing yet.. 
Summary:. I really love this camera, you can't expect less quality from canon.. I want to say something tho, I bought this camera online at amazon, but it took a while because it was out of stock all the time.... But I found this tool that help me get one a retail price on amazon , not from those thiefs that charge twice the price... check it out, it's free www[DOT] productbeeper[DOT]com. anyway, I'm very satisfied with this camera, you will be too.. 

$$;
Pros:. I LOVE that most of the camera settings have a dial or button right on the camera (I hate software menus); ISO, Exposure, Aperture, shutter, manual mode dials are all easily accessible.. 
Cons:. None, this is a great camera.. 
Summary:. I'm a semi-pro photographer. I own several Canon SLRs. I wanted an easy-to-carry, feature-packed, "sneaky cam" -- something that I could take great shots with that would not bring attention to me. This camera is absolutely perfect. 0 complaints. I LOVE that most of the camera settings have a dial or button right on the camera (I hate software menus); ISO, Exposure, Aperture, shutter, manual mode dials are all easily accessible.. If you're looking for a camera that shoots in RAW and takes stunning pictures, this one is for you.. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G5ZTPY?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=reacomtid-20&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;creativeASIN=B001G5ZTPY. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid camera with good image quality producing RAW/JPEG images. The camera is well built, with a solid magnesium alloy body. The lens is great as Canon products, the quality of image is great. Controls are well designed like other Canon cameras.. 
Cons:. Battery life could be better. High level of noise above ISO 400. Could be faster.. 
Summary:. I had a previous G9, and I can tell you, this G10 is a great improvement! You can record an JPEG and RAW image of the same picture! The solid construction (magnese alloy and rubber grip) is made for a serious photographer... The flash hot shoe is a welcome improvement, you can use all EOS digital cameras flash units. But not everything is a paradise... The camera is not fast as you can expect in this pricey equipment, and the high noise at high ISO (above 400 and in low light) can disapoint someone looking for perfect pictures. But I think this is a great camera! One of the best compact digital camera ever! This is for real serious photographer!. 

$$;
Pros:. Love being able to take wide angle photos with ease; the face finder is cool, and the ability to take close up shots which stay sharp is truly amazing.. 
Cons:. I'm sure there are cons - for me, as a novice user, I have lots of settings to learn, but it's definitely easy to point and shoot. Some changes from the G9 like ease of deleting photos - harder now.. 
Summary:. Great Camera! If you need a professional camera, perhaps this isn't the one for you. But for the casual user, I think you'll find everything you are looking for!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent pictures, Good materials, nice feeling, wide angle pictures, quick menus. 
Cons:. I doesnï¿½t have any antbirght film or antiscratch in the lcd display. Very dificult to find a exact case for this camera.. 
Summary:. Great camera for those who want quality pictures and also want a camera that feels great in the hand.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great layout. Easy to use. Feature packed. Great back-up to a DSLR or for someone who wants the features without the bulk.. 
Cons:. Does not have a bulb setting. Pictures can be grainy at high ISO. 
Summary:. This for me has been a wonderful little camera! It takes amazing crisp pictures. If you want a pro-level camera without the size and money commitment, then this is a great camera for you. I am a college student, so for me I needed a camera that was good, but I couldnt afford the extra cost of lenses that a DSLR requires. I have so far taken about 1500 pictures and I couldnt be happier. If you are just wanting a point and shoot, this camera is not for you. It can be complicated to those new at photography. But, if you want the best point and shoot. Then this is by far the camera for you!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent quality photos, great zoom, lots of extra features. 
Cons:. Software for computer is large and doesn't offer all the features I'd like. 
Summary:. The camera itself is wonderful. The zoom function is awesome, and there are lots of onboard features that are just awesome. There have been only a couple of pictures that the red eye could not be removed from, which irks me, but whatever. The software for the computer takes up a lot of space and some of it is a little unnecessary. The photo editting program doesn't offer all of the options I would like it to, but external software can be used for that. All in all, I absolutely LOVE the camera, could do without the computer software.. 

$$;
Pros:. this is a great camera. 
Cons:. non so far. 
Summary:. this is a great camera. 

$$;
Pros:. image quality is very good for a point-and-shoot camera. 
Cons:. Almost all of these small CCD sensor cameras exhibit noisy images even at ISO 400. 
Summary:. Luminous Landscape did a comparison between a 35+ Megapixel Hasselblad and the G10, by printing out several equivalent-sized prints.. No contest? Not quite.. Multiple photo experts inspected these prints.. They essentially could not tell the prints apart.. This does NOT mean that the G10 is a DSLR equivalent. It DOES mean that, for a point and shoot camera, it more than holds its own.. Particularly handy are the readily accessible ISO and exposure adjust dials. AND, it shoots RAW.. This will be a very handy backup for DSLR owners who don't want to "shlep" their equipment around on any particular day. And it will be a fine camera for those who want more creative control and quality than a typical small camera provides.. Nice work Canon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality, lots of options to adjust settings, compact. 
Cons:. Slow fps speed, heavy for compact camera. 
Summary:. For a 15mp camera this is a great buy. It will definitely allow you to take quality pictures of any size. If you are not in the market for a DSLR, for the price, this camera beats the competition hands down.. 

$$;
Pros:. The relocation of the ISO dial is a great improvement. It was far too easy on the G9 to have that one accidentally "twist" while pulling the camera out of a bag. I bigger grip on the front is welcome.. 
Cons:. 14 megapixel on a skimpy sensor is far too high. Even the G9 would fare better with a decent 8 MP. Never understood the race for yet higher "technical" resolution.. The LCD should be rest in to the camera a bit since it is easy to scratch it.... 

$$;
Pros:. Many mechanical controls, nice display, RAW, good IQ in low ISO, live histogram. 
Cons:. High ISO performance is not good, not really a pocket camera, bad grip. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast! Did I say fast? Great shutter response if you use the SDHC cards of quality and speed. Built like a tank (typical Canon). Superior lens and response from its auto-focus. One of the best-ever screens even in sunlight. Priced very well!. 
Cons:. UDMA cards??? Why not? Even a CF card? This camera needs better media for its megapixel capability and a SD card slows it down when I compare it to my Canon 50D.. 
Summary:. All these features for $499 or less makes the G10 an excellent if not superior choice. Getting SLR quality &#38; speed in a point &#38; shoot (yes, it's really a high-end point &#38; shoot) means you'll have excellent high-end pictures/images for a camera that behaves more like a BMW in performance and at a price far less than it should be due to great competition from Nikon and Panasonic.. Canon makes products that are all fit for imaging. That's their core business. Canon lenses are second to nothing else out there. Panasonic makes vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens and irons besides cameras.. An excellent choice but again, get the best SDHC card(s) you can find to marry to this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great stills. Great manual settings. 
Cons:. Just a little bulky. I wish it was a little faster.. 
Summary:. This DSLR takes some nice shots. I'm impressed with the images and I love the manual settings. Nice and easy to use. I just wish it was a little faster. Overall a great camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. this is a great product. 
Cons:. this is a great product. 
Summary:. this is a great product. 

$$;
Pros:. Size and raw.. 
Cons:. Size and Adobe Camera Raw.. 
Summary:. I just bought a G10 and have spent a few days, including one at Disneyland, shooting away. I normally shoot a Canon XSi Digital Rebel with "L" lenses, so I'm a bit spoiled. I never owned a G9, so the physical package is OK by me, but it is NOT tiny so I bought a case that fits on my belt.. I wish the lens was f2.8 as a max open aperture at all focal lengths instead of f2.8 to f4.5.. The Menu system is a mess like earlier Canon SLRs requiring lots of scrolling with a fiddley navigation dial. Please Canon, copy the Menu system from the XSi quickly.. The Manual Focus button is waaaaay too easy to hit, leaving you with a potential for lots of out-of-focus images.. The Image Stabilization is OK, but not impressive.. As of 10/27 Adobe has yet to upgrade the Lightroom and Photoshop raw processors to include the G10 which leaves me trying to figure out the clunky Canon DPP raw processor. I'm a confirmed Lightroom user, so this is REALLY annoying.. Image quality is pretty good unless you look close. If you do look close, the deficiencies of a small sensor are pretty evident. Definitely stick to ISO 80 or 100 for quality.. I got what I expected, but its a product that can be improved.. 

$$;
Pros:. foor taking. 
Cons:. nice pictures. 

$$;
Pros:. Monitor, Stabi and Features. 
Cons:. I Owned G7, G9 and is saw now the G10 Photos they got worse with every generation from G7 on. G7 Photos are hi-detailed, contrasty, great colored, just like a small DSL, the G9 startet to suffer from noise and Noise reduction but the G10 is worst.. 
Summary:. Since the G10 Photos look like Bob Ross painted them (if you zoom a little) it is time to show Canon that we, the customers are tired of the Megapixel-race, and we want back the great image quality of the G7 - catch a used G7 or G9 while you can.. Canon - built better sensors or bigger sensors into your Hi-Class Compact ones if you want to put 15MP into them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features -- but nothing that other camera makers can't do.. 
Cons:. The thing that made the G series stand out for many iterations was that it combined high quality resolution, flash hot shoe, and good zoom with a Vari-Angle LCD screen.. 
Summary:. It was a huge mistake to drop the Vari-Angle LCD screen from the G series, and a big mistake not to bring it back for the G-10. The G-series has been a relatively ho-hum camera since Canon dropped the Vari-Angle LCD screen. That Vari-Angle LCD screen was the Canon "Gee Whiz" feature in the G-series that others weren't/aren't doing. It provided a unique versatility for photo composition in unusual circumstances that the G-series just can't get close to matching with a fixed LCD screen. Overhead at concerts, shows, etc; better composition for remote control use when photographer is in picture; 90 degree shots out of windows -- things that just cannot be done as easily (if at all) with a fixed LCD screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing better than G9. 
Cons:. Video mode - no time lapse, no optical zoom(absolutely required). 
Summary:. I just have had it my new G10. After I found that the raw CR2 can be edited with Digital Photo Professional. I bought one and gave away my 8 months old G9 to my daughter. I am extremely disappointed with Canon this time. The team who design G10 must be blind. It is a big step backward from G9. So many features were taken away from G9 that renders G10 useless. People buy G9 for its versatility in photo and video. Without any improvement in photo capabilities, Canon takes away too many things from Video capabilities, such as time lapse video and optical zoom with video. Without these two features, G10 is useless. Anyone interested in my new G10. You will find it in eBay.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wide zoom, ease of use. 
Cons:. Time lapse, HD video missing. 
Summary:. I have very little to say about this camera. I owned the G9, I loved the G9. I bought the G10 to replace the G9, enticed by it's wider range. I was willing to sacrifice the better telephoto range of the G9, at ~35mm-210mm, to get the wide angle the G10 provides with ~28mm-140mm. I used it for a few weeks, sold my G9, and shortly thereafter discovered that the major video features that really sealed the deal in my purchasing the G9 to begin with were missing from the G10 - no HD video, no time lapse video. I actually feel like canon stole from me. I figured I'd be climbing up the G series line indefinitely, but I'm pretty sure my relationship with canon is over, unless they treat the G-series enthusiasts right and release a firmware upgrade that restores the video functionality present on the G9. There are plenty of other great brands out there with better quality on a given ISO, namely nikon with it's P5000/5100 and P6000. We shouldn't reward Canon for producing a handicapped product, and I'm personally upset that I did..
