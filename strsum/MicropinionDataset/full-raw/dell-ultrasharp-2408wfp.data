this is the desktop graphics , gaming and work lcd to have  .
i originally bought this being influenced by an e3 show in los angeles  .
every game company it seemed is using this monitor to showcase their games on every system from ps3/xbox360 to the pc and mac  .
i figured if they used this to showcase their games to graphic perfection , with the media staring at them from all sides , then this must be the monitor to have and i is right about that hdmi , vga , dvi component , composite  .
as well , two usb2  .
0 ports , a speaker connector  .
pip/pbp so i run my security camera or my tv in a small window thru composite , and have my pc on the dvi , and my xbox360 thru hdmi and i just love this monitor  .
i even love the stand  .
being able to turn this sideways to play visual pinball full screen makes it perfect for virtual pinball games  .
it feels and looks like you're at a real table playing buy it  .
stop looking around  .
this is the one to get  .
more people will complain then those that will come to a site just to compliment a product  .
as with any product there will be defects here and there  .
i've purchase 22 of these (for my company and 4 at home) and not one of them had even so much as a dead pixel on them  .
if it did , dell would replace it without issue  .
buy it  .
do it  .
now dammit  .
;    )  .
i couldn't recommend the dell 2408 wfp highly enough (unless you can afford a 27' or 30 monitor , in which case i'd recommend the largest screen you can afford , but do not put quality before size ie  .
in which case , look to dell anyway) .
dell lowered the price by $100 and sent me a $50 discount and that cinched the deal for me  .
i have owned two ultrasharp displays and have never had any problems with them at all  .
likewise , the dell desktops that i have owned (i currently have a dimention 9100) have been rock solid , and i would definitely consider purchasing another system from them i wo not repeat the points mentioned in the cnet review and just say that i would recommend this display to anyone looking for an outstanding 24 monitor  .
watch for special prices/discounts    dell currently (07    31    09) has the 2408wfp for $439 .
this monitor is a bit more pricey than others in the 24 category , but i feel for me that it is worth it  .
i got rid of my tv in my room since this is large enough , and it had multiple inputs for the xbox and stuff .
basically , it's one of the few 24 pva screens on the market  .
it's not as good as an i    ips panel , but it also sells for half the price  .
for those who have stuck with the common tn panels for many years , this premium panel is worth it for the wow factor .
ok there are display port to dvi cables available on    line  .
there are also dvi    d to hdmi cables too  .
so you could mix and match  .
for example 4 hdmi connections compatibility with dvi and hdmi  .
the dvi signal is electrically compatible with hdmi video signal ; no signal conversion needs to take place when an adapter is used and consequently no loss in video quality occurs  .
as such hdmi is backward compatible with digital visual interface carrying digital video (dvi    d or dvi    i , but not dvi    a) used on modern computer monitors and graphics cards  .
this means that a dvi    d source can drive an hdmi monitor , or vice versa , by means of a suitable adapter or cable , but the audio and remote control features of hdmi will not be available  .
additionally , without support for high    bandwidth digital content protection (hdcp) on the dvi input , the signal source will prevent the end user from viewing or recording hdcp protected content  .
(note that hdcp is available on some dvi connections)  .
source   wikipedia search hdmi  .
so this monitor is a buy and i bought one  .
i will use the following on it  .
ps3 (hdmi) , xbox 360 1stgen (component) , mac mini (dvi) , macbook pro (dvi) , a gaming pc (display port to dvi    d cable) and a work pc (svga) .
this is by far the best 24 monitor money can buy  .
i happened to scoop one of these up brand new from ebay (i know its risky) for $490  .
i just finished watching blu ray version of 300  .
i have to tell you that the visual experience is phenomenal coupled with 5  .
1 surround sound , i actually felt like i is part of the movie  .
becuase it is an s    pva panel , this monitor has no ghosting , superb color gamut , perfect viewing angles , and the 6ms response time has no effect as i still pwn in cs  s  .
i highly recommend this monitor to anyone who wants full hi    def and a plethora of features did i mention the features  .
2 x dvi with hdcp support  .
hdmi  .
displayport  .
analog (vga)  .
component  .
s    video  .
composite  .
as well as ,  .
(2) usb 2  .
0    left , (2) usb 2  .
0    back  .
9    in    2 flash reader  .
(usb connection to pc required)  .
audio out  .
optional speaker bar  .
most people won't use these features , however the fact that dell did not skip over anything is awesome  .
displayport is one of the more unique things about this screen  .
all in all this a superb monitor that will please even the harshest critics .
great monitor for graphic designers and photgraphy buffs , especially if you purchase a color calibrator  .
i use mostly for writing code which is great on such a readable , high    resolution monitor .
i chose the dell ultrasharp because of my past experience with dell monitors , which i have to say has been pretty good  .
i wanted it as soon as it came out , and i had to pay the early    adopter tax to get it  .
but i have not been disappointed  .
the picture is wonderful , the options are great , the adjustments let you make this exactly what you need it to be  .
monitor , tv (hd looks awesome) for your xbox360 (understanding that its not 1080p) or whatever  .
it's easy to work with , its easy to move and it has a bevy of connectors  .
hdmi , display port , 2 dvi , vga , component , composite , and audio out for your speakers the only gripe i have is that the usb and media card reader don't work when the display is off  .
that is a problem for me because i wanted to use the usb ports on the side to connect my iphone and sync it when i went to bed  .
i shut the power on the monitor off , and when i got up the next morning i do not tend to read manuals or instructions , so this may have been mentioned , but the truth is , killing power to the monitor should not render these features useless .
really , it's an awesome monitor  .
i'm glad i spent extra money to get a good one with a good adjustable stand  .
if i is dell , i would have dropped the built in usb hub and memory stick readers and saved 75$  .
then it would have been perfect .
clean , bright and just does its job well  .
really well .
nice gaming monitor , has a game mode in the presets , without a doubt , this is far better than the monitor that it replaced (samsung syncmaster t240)  .
no dead pixels that i can see , and it seems to be pretty good in picture quality , albeit it's still in torch mode that it shipped with  .
i'll have to figure out how to make the picture more natural  .
if anyone can help me with that , that would be very much appreciated  .
other than that , this is definitely worth every penny of that extra premium for what it can do updated  .
on mar 6 , 2009  .
just got mine on june 23 ; got lucky and received a good one , no complaints at all  .
very crisp display , bright images , vibrant colors  .
vga input could not handle the 800x600 signal from an older video card , but once i swapped in a new card and drove it at native 1920x1200       holy shmokes  .
also hooked up a sony blu    ray player , watched no country for old men  .
best lcd movie experience i've ever had  .
highly recommended  .
the best monitor i have ever owned  .
i cannot recommend it highly enough  .
it does everything i want it to and does it well .
this is my first review ever  .
i currently have two of these in my office here , both get used for graphic design and video production i must say , these monitors are wild  .
the default brightness level is way to bright and the saturation of the reds and greens is almost blinding at first  .
if you are not prepared to get a color calibration device and calibrate it properly , you're in for a very bright and colorful computing experience for example , you will notice , very quickly , that you'll need to enable the color management feature in firefox in order to get a color managed web browsing experience (google it , it's a hidden option in firefox  .
) if you use ie , or firefox without enabling color management , the reds and greens will be so over saturated , it's almost clown like browsing experience so , to sum this up  .
you will need to properly calibrate this monitor and enable the firefox color management option , if not , while your reds and greens will be colorful , it will not be very accurate final note   again , if you calibrate this monitor , you will have something which can compete , somewhat , with eizo's top of the line coloredge offerings  .
also , to all you pva haters , i'd just like to remind you that eizo uses s    pva panels , just like this dell .
truecolor technology that allows for 110% color gamut super full hd lcd .
my first ever on line review because the product is so good i'd recommend it to anyone  .
i've read some on line comments about problems with bleeding and banding in a totally dark room i see a little bit in upper left corner , in normal light , nothing  .
banding  .
i magnified a screen cap and measured banding at 8 pixels  .
the green ghosting on text is no big deal for me  .
no dead pixels or bright pixels and with dell's return policy not a problem at all  .
i've seen people say they'll wait for revision a01 but why  .
if you get a good one like i did , enjoy , if not , return and get a good one , dell makes it easy .
having been a previous owner of the 2407 dell ultrasharp monitor i is a little concerned about ghosting as a problem in this monitor as the 2407 had a terrible ghosting problem in games and movies probably due to the factory cranking the overdrive up to ludicrous speed we've turned plaid  .
suffice to say that i is more than pleased when i hooked this monitor up to my pc and my xbox 360 and found that my new monitor displayed no noticeable ghosting at all in fact , ghosting aside the image quality on this monitor is astonishing  .
with just a little tweaking in the options menu i discovered just how beautiful gaming and 1080p movies could be  .
the colors are accurately displayed for the most part  .
like i said a little adjustment is needed but goodlord after i is done with my tuning , this monitor really pops  .
many inputs make this monitor an excellent multimedia display for a bedroom or office  .
i found the hdmi and rgb inputs to be relatively useless for hd movie play back in 1080p due to display scaling / cropping , however there are two dvi inputs that will display an hd input perfectly  .
static image quality is probably a little sketchy for those of you who make a living off of that sort of thing  .
i noticed a little color shifting in some of my static test images  .
if your just an average consumer you wo not notice though as the picture quality is still way above average for gaming this monitor is spectacular  .
the changes i noticed going from the old one to this are simply mind bending  .
eve looks incredible  .
you can really see how much love dell put in this monitor for gamers over the 2407 i recommend this monitor to anyone and everyone  .
at this price point it just cannot be beat thanks for reading my article gar  .
i have the monitor hooked up to a new dell system at work  .
it is amazing in that configuration  .
a monitor with a similarly configured system , ram , video card , etc  .
like anything you mix and match , i could see buying this monitor , or many others for that matter , and it does not work as you like  .
i have not gamed with it  .
i have dvd'd with it  .
and hours upon hours of general office use , including photoshop , autocad , illustrator and so forth  .
in that circumstance , it is exceptional  .
again , on my system built and configured to work right with this behemoth  .
at home i have an imac (fully top line outfitted) and that (or this since i am on it now) is amazing  .
just not seeing all the negatives some of you have so it may just be configuration compatibility issues .
i have had very good luck with dell products at work and home  .
the computers have gone down in quality a small bit in the past year  .
the monitors have actually gone up in quality in the past year  .
the only thing i have to say about the 24 inch is , if you can at all afford it or cut corners elsewhere , just spring for the 30 inch  .
also get the big warranty and a big power surge too , which is what i did not do  .
but the silver lining is , i'll soon have a spanking new 30 inch monitor  .
unless there's something bigger dell monitors have never let me down , ever .
ordered (from dell) on the 10th or 11th of january 2009 , and shipped on the 13th , this absolutely pristine monitor arrived on our doorstep today  .
small text is crystal clear and sharp , colors are spectacular , monitor is bright and strong , and you may want to tune that down slightly  .
immediately out of the box and quickly assembled and connected it performs sensationally  .
have not observed any heat issues (at all) or (blue) color issues noted by others on other sites  .
other than dialing down the brightness slightly , nothing more needed to be done  .
my son is very content playing world of warcraft on this gorgeous monitor  .
it pivots too  .
wife likes that  .
big dell discount on these right now (jan 2009) .
i just bought two 2408wfp's and have them side by side  .
i like two    screen setups because i do alot of layout work and imaging work at the same time  .
monitors were both blindingly bright , with complete oversaturation of reds  .
took me about 20 minutes on each screen to get the picture to acceptable color , detail and get black level set  .
a good professional    quality calibration is really a good idea with this monitor and i'll be doing that this week  .
but it is possible to get the panel dialed in pretty close with software calibration  .
i'm using ati video card and it works well with both monitors i is disappointed , though , in one of the panels lack of uniformity in screen lighting  .
with no picture , just black , the left side of the screen is a bit brighter than the right side  .
there are also anomalies in the corners  .
the other monitor is better in this regard , but it's a concern about dell's quality control  .
with most material , the problem is not that noticeable , but still i really dislike the on    screen control system  .
it's difficult to punch all these buttons , and the choices are difficult to navigate  .
i used the ati software to do most of the settings  .
all in all , a great value for a 24 incher , with just a few warts .
overall , this is an excellent monitorthe image quality is great , excellent motion    response for video and games , minimal if any ghosting , and lots of picture adjustments  .
the connection options are very nice if you plan to connect multiple devices , although i personally have not used any of them , so i cannot speak to any limitations or caveats i also use an apple display of the same size (which is twice the price , due largely to the aluminum enclosure) , and this dell preforms better in almost every way  .
the one thing i really like about the apple display is that it's text display is quite a bit smoother  .
i'm on a mac where high    quality text anti    aliasing is standard , so that's a tiny bit disappointing  .
still , probably the only reason i notice it is because the apple does it slightly better  .
also , the dell is slightly slower waking from standby  .
in most other ways the dell is superior (adjustability , color , contrast) i'm very happy with the dell and i've had no dead pixels or other problems of any kind .
this is the best monitor i've ever had just a tad bulky and heavy  .
bought the acer 22 just did not like the picture (cool bluue) so i bought this one great product goes nice with my 420 .
after a year developed more and more bad pixels  .
tech support at dell is great and sent me a new monitor , a u2410  .
assume it is latest version  .
picture looks just as good  .
hopefully the hardware will hold up .
honestly , if your not a professional or not a big gamer , its a great monitor  .
but if lag and color is important to you , look elsewhere  .
on the paper this is a overall great monitor with good color , interface , and brightness , and that is possibly why reviewers have given this monitor so great reviews but testing out fancy images and color templates have nothing to do with real use and this is where this monitor falls through  .
as a highend product you do expect some quality first of all the input lag is gigantic  .
60 sec in avrage input test from various sites and i can 100% agree  .
its horrible if you have too much text on the screen at once the screen starts to distort itself in some wierd way  .
text itself is also very unsharp if you want a 24 inch monitor go buy it somewhere else  .
dell's 24 inch is not worth the buck .
i am out of here .
i don't know why cnet rated this monitor so high  .
i guess dell persuaded them  .
so much for unbiased review  .
this monitor has very bad image quality with default factory settings  .
for example , look at people's photos on web pages    they all look like either their skin is sunburned or they are drunk  .
the picture quality can be improved if it is recalibrated , but even after that it has big issues with oversaturated red and green  .
people on photos look like they are drunk (reddish faces)  .
some colors are plain wrong even after calibration (i  .
cyan can have magenta tones)  .
this is the biggest downside of this monitor    even if you do not do graphical design , you normally make pictures of your realtives and they all gonna look pink on this monitor the second big problem          it strains your eyes    there is some flickering on lower brightness setting that is used most often  .
your eyes get tired pretty quickly  .
the only way to fix it is to put it to 100 brightness and then lower brightness on your video card also , there is a greenish effect around the text  .
it can be minimized if recalibarated , but does not disappear completely there is some lag in the games , not big , but still visible on a positive side    it is big , it has a solid design and good ergonomical stand  .
there are many different video connectors  .
it is relatively cheap i have dell 2407 at work and i think it is better than 2408  .
i decided to buy 2408 just because i assumed that it can be an improvement over 2407  .
i guess i is wrong .
i just purchased 2 of these 2408wfp's to use as dual monitors  .
i thought i did all my homework prior to making the purchase but evidently not  .
the model currently shipping is a first version and has major issues  .
just check the dell support forums customers with this monitor are eagerly awaiting a new hardware revision  .
first , the wide color gamut is basically incompatible with internet explorer  .
(and any other non    color managed applications  .
) most images on the web and in most other applications use the standard srgb color profile  .
this monitor does a poor job in displaying these images  .
users are having to use special color    managed web browsers for this monitor  .
second , this monitor has been found to have the worst input lag of just about any lcd  .
gamers be warned this monitor is not for you  .
the input lag is so bad it's even noticeable in scrolling on web pages  .
dell is promising an updated revision that should fix the input lag and other issues  .
not sure how they will address the color gamut issue if even at all  .
what this monitor needs is a srgb color profile mode for everyday use  .
a computer store recommended this monitor to me  .
i bought the monitor , and soon after random coloured dots started appearing on the screen  .
this progressed to a flickering screen , and finally to a screen that would blank out  .
i bought a new video card , but it still blanked out  .
the computer store sent the monitor back for a second one  .
the brand new second monitor also blanked out  .
dell refused to refund the computer store for the monitor ; all they would do is keep sending back the same type of monitor that did not work  .
luckily the store replaced the monitor  .
i am now happily using a nec monitor with no issues  .
dell refused to post this review on its own site  .
as a result , i lost the use of my computer for 6 weeks , while the store had to argue with dell .
bought this monitor in part because of the cnet review , but also needed the displayport connection for the new graphics cards (nviidia quadro fx3800)  .
the monitor did not recognize the signal on the displayport connection and with the dvi cable the signal is on and off (went into sleep mode)  .
tried to rectify with an updated driver from dell and could not find on their website (cannot get much help without a service tag #)  .
is on the phone for 1  .
5 hours with technical support getting passed from rep to rep  .
technical support personnel don't know they make monitors , wo not help you without a service tag # , and one asked what a displayport was  .
after they put me back in the automated que , i gave up and requested a refund  .
i am done with dell .
why did i bother sopending au$900 on this peace of junk  .
do not buy this monitor  .
i have purchased this monitor based on cnets review and i cannot believe they have got it so worng  .
bought the 2408wfp rev1 and it still suffers from many of the problems from rev0  .
i called dell to have it replaced after a week with a new one but after a week of waitng i called back and they prtended that i never called in the first place  .
then i had to organise another replacement  .
they sent me a refurbished rev1 (used) and it is even worst than my oroginal i bought this from dell expecting quality and good service    and got none of these  .
using this monitor felt like i is in las vegas at night  .
the colors (green/red) were neon  .
all this is after calibration using all its functions  .
the editors must not have too much knowledge of color to rate this monitor so high  .
(maybe it is because dell sponsored them  .
) i promptly returned the monitor for a full refund .
my wife does serious photography editing and design , and she has an apple 24 led cinema display  .
it is stunning , and very easy on the eyes  .
on the other hand , i do a lot of programming and email , so i originally didn't care about color and looks and bought a dell 2408wfp purely based on specifications  .
this dell is a big step up from my 20 dell that's about 5 years old  .
at every aspect , the dell on paper seems superior to the apple in terms of bang for bucks , and in terms of amazing features  .
dell wins every aspect , hands down the dell is pretty cheap , and if you catch dell deals at the right time you can get it directly from dell for $450 with shipping and handling  .
when i got it , i is super excited  .
i opened the box , and boy oh boy , this has got to be one of the clunkiest , plastic looking behemoth i've ever seen  .
it's thick , bulky , and looks very typical pc , which is alright , because i've been a pc person all my life  .
function over form , right  .
it has a very very bright backlight and the colors are quite vivid , and it's a pretty good deal considering how little you pay for so much features  .
however , after using it for a while , i realized that i is getting a lot of eye fatigue  .
during the day , i needed to turn the brightness from the default eye blinding 50 down to about 15 , and at night , i needed to turn it down to 0  .
even at 0 , it is still eye blindingly bright  .
this has got to be one of the brightest monitors i've ever had in my life , and if you find it appealing to look at bright monitors like how moths fly to those bug lanterns , you'll love this dell  .
one of the most annoying thing about the dell is that to change the brightness , you must get into the dell menu       minus button (to call the brightness menu) , minus button again to get into brightness selection , enter to select it , then finally    /+ to select brightness , then enter , then plus to select exit , then enter  .
that's at least 7 buttons  .
on a mac , you can do it in 2 seconds  .
i cannot believe how bad the usability on the dell is even after so many years that they could have improved it  .
the next most irritating thing about this monitor is the lack of power    off feature  .
if your laptop is suspended , it'll go to sleep  .
but the moment you unplug it to go out , it goes back alive and says no input instead of sleeping gracefully  .
everytime i unplug , i also have to remember to turn it off manually , which is really annoying  .
even my old dell monitor slept when i unplugged it  .
the inconsistent user interface is just yet another example of how badly engineered this monitor is as for color , i don't know what to say  .
if your life doesn't require knowing what srgb , adobergb , raw , color calibration , printing , etc , then it doesn't matter  .
however , i do some basic web design and photography , and i've had no choice but to calibrate the monitor  .
by default , this monitor is too bright , and too vivid for serious photographic needs , and requires a calibration hardware+software (i use spyder3pro which although not spectacular , gets the job done) i've always wondered why the apple led cinema display looked sharper , and simply looked nicer  .
so i took my nikkor 105mm f/2  .
8 micro lens vr for a 1  1 repro close    up macro on an aps    c camera , which resolves much more resolution than a naked eye can possibly see (near microscopic)  .
go to amazon to see the pictures i uploaded  .
the apple display is superior in terms of clarity  .
if this dell is suppose to be ultra sharp , then the apple is superiorly sharper (and without hurting your eyes)  .
as for color the colors on the macs just look better , pre    calibrated without much adjustments needed  .
if it weren't for the fact that my current computer doesn't support mini    displayport , i'd have gotten an apple led display already  .
i guess i'll just have to wait for my next big upgrade so that i can get the apple display in short , if you're a programmer or just a casual emailer/web browser , and if you want the most features or the brightest backlighting hitting your eye balls , and if you do not care anything about srgb/adobergb/etc this dell is an awesome monitor  .
it probably has one of the best bangs for bucks , with tons of features like multiple video inputs and card readers which i do find very useful since i do a lot of digital photography  .
on paper , the specifications are very impressive  .
on the other hand , if you want a well built , well designed , and great looking graphical display for serious photography and serious graphical needs , one that looks good on your desktop and is easy on the eyes , one with excellent resale values year after year if these things matter to you more , then the apple 24 led cinema display is really worth every single penny .
bought one about 2 years ago for my personal use  .
not bad although you have to use it at a very low brightness if you do work like programming/editing documents , otherwise expect some serious eye strain  .
as for my fps / action gaming , that when out the window and i'm back to my cheap 19 lcd for that yesterday i got a brand new 24 dell for work  .
all i can say is it's horrible next to my 22 dell  .
the 22 's quality looks like a $1000 vs a $300  .
yes , i've tried all the settings from preset to custom  .
all i can say is 1) if you're going to have thin back line i  .
text on white then stay away  .
2) if you're planning on playing games like quake , cod , oblivion i  .
games where you have to turn quickly then stay away  .
i'm very disappointed , wish i just ordered another 22    (  .
i ordered this great    sounding monitor online from dell  .
when i checked by email the next day to determine the status of the order , the information i got is that the order is canceled  .
i called dell       four times , and spoke to eleven different people , is referred to two specialists who were not available and a third whose voicemail is full  .
the gist of it is that dell put a hold on my mastercard account for $633 , and canceled the order because       they say       the order is not approved  .
luckily , it only took a second call to mastercard to void the whole transaction  .
i had forgotten about dell's three stooges approach to customer service , and came out of it feeling like i'd been through a chinese fire drill in a subway and emerged with my wallet missing  .
if this is how they treat people trying to make a purchase , imagine what trying to navigate the warranty servicing would be like  .
i'll find another monitor from a more reputable dealer  .
caveat emptor .
i is about to go buy one of these , when i checked the prices here in europe i'm not sure what these folks have been smoking , but the price in europe is  double  the us price  .
kind of ironic since it is made in asia somewhere    i do not think the shipment to europe costs $600 more than the shipment to the us it would be cheaper to fly to the us and back to buy it .
