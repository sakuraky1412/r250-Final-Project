the sleaker and sexier design makes the new 360 much more appealing than the older models by far  .
not only is this a boost to aesthetics , but it is also more efficient with airflow design improvements and touch buttons  .
both a vast improvement from previous models , especially original core/pro models  .
it runs quietly , more so if you opt to install your game to the massive 250gb hdd  .
there have not been any tell    tale signs of a faulty system , such as freezing , overheating , glitching , erros messages , so far  .
i purchased the s 250gb in a holiday bundle package (the only one available at gamestop) which came with a brand new mic and a copy of forza 3  .
definately worth the $299  .
if you have an older model of the 360 , i definately recommend trading it in for $70 today  .
the hdd is an additional $10 , and your network adaptor will yield another $20  .
throw in a couple of games to trade in and you can get the system for nearly half price bottom line   pick up this xbox  .
you will be much happier after trading in your old system for this upgraded beauty .
it is nice to have an xbox that comes with the wifi built in  .
the 250gb drive is nice too .
would buy again in a heartbeat  .
overall it's great .
this is how the 360 should have been done the first time around  .
it functions perfectly , runs quiet , is fast and is able to cool much more efficiently  .
the 250gb hard drive keeps me from worrying about taking up too much space .
awesome upgrade , if for no other reason than the rrod and overheat issues are gone  .
that's more than enough cannot wait to see how kinect turns out also , the quality of gamer is much higher on xbox live than i have encountered on ps network have not played online on the wii  .
to me , paying for it keeps the gamer caliber and manners at a level of goodness that is quite satisfactory  .
i'm more than happy to fork out the cash to keep 360 online play less cluttered and quality oriented .
this console is a great upgrade  .
have not found any at the moment .
i am so sick of sony fan boys making up lies  .
coming from a former member of sca gamer advisory panel i know what i am talking about  .
yea it does not have blue    ray  .
but if you only knew how many friends i have that bought a ps3 and regret doing so  .
the games with the exception of a few are crap  .
their online service is buggy and glitchy as all hell  .
so easy to hack into service and cheat  .
yes you pay for xbox live but i love that feature  .
hardly any little kiddies messing up your games and cussing  .
but if you ever experience it microsoft put in a mute option  .
plus there frequently working to improve there great service  .
i love hearing about the xbox 360 rrd yet nothing about how the ps breaks and constant disc read errors  .
i had 9 yes 9 ps2 all different models and constant errors  .
if it was not for them breaking it is unable to read disc over and over again  .
so in summery  .
this new xbox 360 is a bargain of a deal with or without the trade in outlets  .
so many new ports and wifi integration  .
of course cant put vertical but ask any game store attendant that knows what there doing  .
if you put any console vertical it will scratch the disc  .
so why they make them stands never know  .
so game easy and without a doubt pick up this great new xbox 360 slim system .
worth the upgrade , but do not buy from gamestop  .
their trade    in promo is a scam  .
is told that it ended 2 days ago , but no where in the store were their signs or notices explaining that the program had ended  .
however on gamestop  .
com    says offer expires on 7    18    2010 .
for the most part i like the new 360 and will most likely be buying one  .
this is by far the best console made by microsoft  .
i don't hear a peep from the console the the volume is turned on  .
the only problem for me is that i need to buy a separate cable to transfer  .
it is the ultimate console for gaming at the moment  .
why waste 50 extra dollars for 250gb ps3 when nowadays , you can even get a blu ray player for less than that  .
it is a much better 360 p  .
don't listen to the jealous ps3 fanboys in the reviews who give this amazing console half a star even though they did not buy it .
microsoft unveiled the redesigned xbox 360 as the xbox 360 slim at e3 2010 in los angeles  .
the pros will point out many of the new additions found on this slim model  .
the addition of the 250gb hard drive and the integrated 802  .
11n wireless are the biggest add ons , while the smaller packaging and extra ports for audio , video , and device connection round up the subtle differences it's not ground breaking , but it is refined and sexy  .
it's what the xbox 360 should be  .
all for the same price as the current xbox 360 elite console  .
why is this big  .
more bang for your buck  .
the only thing i could have seen microsoft adding in addition would be headphone audio out (1/8 audio to hook up to computer speakers) and perhaps blue tooth connectivity for wireless devices to sync up with the xbox 360  .
yes , this would create extra work and likely would make it harder for them to sell it @ $299  .
but if they did keep the price , everyone would be raving and throwing up 5 stars another item worthy of mention is that microsoft claims they've solved the red ring of death issue that plagued around 5%    10% of their consoles released in the console's first 3 year lifespan  .
this will be very attractive to current xbox 360 owners and likely entice them to upgrade should they have the cash to do so  .
again , this is not amazing new technology , but it's usually the little things that make a console great  .
that said , microsoft has a great console and it looks like we'll have at least 2 years before microsoft decides to announce the xbox 360's predecessor  .
so why not invest and pick on of these up for yourself  .
for $299  .
99 , it's a pretty good buy .
i am actually on my way right now t go get one  .
the best looking console in my collection  .
great update thanks microsoft (thought you guys were dead because of apple hehe) .
the first slim i bought lasted about 20 sec  .
and came up with an error code e68 with the red led  .
so i took it back and exchanged it for a new one  .
so far it has been doing great  .
the size is actually a little smaller than the original but not by much  .
it super quite and does everything the other does  .
i really like the finger print buttons that operate the power and disc reader  .
every system has a problem here and there so do not let my comment dissuade you from purchasing this system .
this is truly what the xbox 360 should have been  .
first of all don't let the slim fool you , it's not noticeably smaller than the first (unlike the ps3 slim) unless held side by side so do not let size be a factor  .
where it wins points is with it's much quieter operation (even more quiet if you install to the hdd) , built in wifi (a/b/g/n , that's faster than the ps3 one if you have a router that support wireless n) , smaller power supply (mo more brick ) and more reliable (ms claims to have eliminated overheating and the rrod , so far mine has not had one issue)  .
i also have to give microsoft credit for not following sony  .
s example and adding features instead of removing features really the only complaint is a lack of a good media experience outside gaming (something they never promised in the first place though)  .
i suppose if you want an all in one entertainment system , the ps3 is still the way to go  .
the 360 doesn  .
t do a good job at being a media center (poor interface , overpriced movie rentals that use  .
points  .
, no blu    ray) , instead it focuses on being a gaming console first  .
and of course the new xbox carries all the benefits of the old (live and the best game selection) despite the improvements , if you already have a working 360 i wouldn  .
t bother buying the upgrade yet  .
chances are if you use wifi you already purchased the ad    on , and if yours hasn  .
t overheated or rrod than it doesn  .
t matter if the new one is less likely too does it  .
basically my suggestion is this  .
if you can afford it get a ps3 and 360 to get the best of both worlds , if you can only afford one get the 360 slim  .
you won  .
t regret it if you enjoy gaming at all .
i have personally been a sony fan since the playstation 1 , but it was not until the first xbox came out which got me into playing halo 2 , ever since i have gotten that , i have been a microsoft fan  .
i have purchased the xbox 360 pro when i first came out , i have been in love with it , i had a couple of errors which i will admit , is not easy , escpecially to be away from a gaming system for a month  .
my dad has picked up a ps3 and it is great , but the online is terrible compared to what xbox 360 has  .
i'm not an xbox 360 fanboy , cause i do enjoy being on both systems , but i enjoy xbox 360 gaming a lot more than ps3  .
at e3 when microsoft announced the new xbox 360 , i thought it is a must have , especially because my xbox is nearly 5 years old and didn't even have a jasper chip  .
i'm actually glad that microsoft didn't include a blu    ray player with the new xbox 360 because xbox is a gaming system , unlike the ps3 which is an enternainment system which focuses on other areas rather than gaming  .
the new xbox 360 is completely silent and is a very fast system compared to what the xbox 360 pro was , and is kinect ready so that is a future advantage over the old xbox 360  .
also i did not see any reviews here mention the new xbox 360 includes a port for a kegningston lock which is usful in some cases like if you go on vacation or if you are away at your house for any reason , your xbox is secured with a new lock  .
also the new xbox 360 includes built in wifi which is a huge update microsoft should've included with the xbox a very long time ago  .
overall this system is amazing and is a big update for people who have old xbox 360 without a jasper chip  .
i updated and i am totally pleased with this buy  .
the price is a little high but it will be worth it in the future .
i would buy it and play video games all day if i could .
i am very happy about getting the new slimer 360 especially since i got it free it is by far the best system out there and now i dont have to worry about getting errors and problems like to r  .
d so it would be a good purchase if you still have the original xbox 360  .
i bought the new 360 about 4 days ago  .
i got it because my old xbox 360 kept overheating and i wanted a hdmi port on the 360 (it is an old one)  .
i bought the old wifi adapter for my old 360 so having wifi on the slim was not new to me  .
it has a big hard drive so i can buy full games from xbl  .
the design looks way cool  .
(it catches fingerprints very easy , but really , we should be worring about air pollution rather than that  .
) micro$ got real greedy on this system  .
it came with no hdmi cable nor component cable , just regular red , white , yellow cables    its the 21st century  .
(luckily i kept my old component cables) i dont know why they havent put a blu    ray player on it  .
i do not care about kinect but it comes with the enabled port  .
but overall i would recommend the slim to whosever xbox 360 goes out , this is the one to get .
overall , this things awesome  .
i used to have an xbox 360 elite , but after about 2 years , it red    ringed on me , and i hocked it for a ps3 after i got it fixed  .
the ps3 is cool , but the online multiplayer is simply weighed , measured , and found extremely wanting  .
i swore , however , i'd never go back to the xbox after the hardware failure fiascos  .
i did  .
the ps3 just didn't do it for me , yeah , its got cool stuff and blue ray (which is the only reason i still have it) but the xbox , with xbox live , had multiplayer down to a science , no more of a theology  .
it still has it  .
and its just as much fun now as ever , except maybe more  .
the new xbox is basically the same thing , just improved  .
it's the one we all wish would have come out first , instead of 5 years after initial release  .
a lot of people say that there are not enough differences to warrant buying it if you already own one  .
that is an understandable arguement , however , this thing has all new hardware inside , that's not supposed to overheat like the old ones (time will tell though)  .
the integrated wifi works great , and it is certainly quieter , as promised  .
i wish it would have come with an hdmi cable or some other free stuff  .
overall though , it's better than expected and microsoft certainly knows what the people want , and they deliver  .
unlike sony still no cross    game chat sigh .
for someone that has the older xbox 360 with a hard drive , and a wi    fi network adapter , there really is no need to upgrade  .
however , if you've been burned by the rrod , or you have a bare bones arcade system and you're looking to upgrade , and you can afford it , why not try this  .
after all , xbox live is way better than the ps network and has much better games .
ive been a gamer since i is 4 no game systems really had the boom effect  .
until e3 when they announced this .
it seems that the slim runs smoother to me , i had the final fantasy xiii edition of the 360 and returned that to best buy for the slim , and it seems like it's a bit smoother then the final fantasy 360 but it could just be me , i will have to see if my 360 gets over heated or the red ring of death but i am hoping for no troubles as such , hopefully i won't have to deal with that but the touch is a bit touchy , it can turn off if you get too close to the power area , i do really like the fact that it's got the built in wifi so i do not have to pay another 70 bucks to use xbox live wirelessly , i think it is worth the 299 but would be perfect if it had blu ray , i really want to see if kinect is what microsoft is saying it's going to be , we'll have to see .
i've been a gamer since i first played afterburner in my sega master system , i is 3 years old  .
since then i've tried to own every console that comes out and that make sense to buy the xbox 360 is not a console that made sense buying up until this model  .
not having integrated wifi up until 2010 is a big drawback , owning a wii and a ps3 i was not willing to drag an ethernet cable all through my living room just to play on the xbox  .
to my surprise the wifi is also really fast compared to the ps3s (specially when downloading updates)  .
250gb hard drive should cover all my media needs , even though i have a 2tb htpc right next to it and making the hard drive propietary , is still a ripoff  .
as other reviews have said , the console is very quiet , sleek and has great power savings the dashboard experience feels like a perfect balance between the wii's childish approach and the ps3's manly    glossy approach  .
i own a roku , htpc , wii and a ps3 , i've tried the netflix experience through all of them and the xbox 360 solution is the best one  .
it is the fastest , sleekest and with wifi 802  .
11n you will be able to watch all your videos in pure (erm , compressed , streamed) hd  .
i'm really looking forward to watch espn videos as well even though i will pay for xbox live , i'm not sure if it's something we should be paying for  .
i'm all for having a premium model but do not limit a game's capabilities just because of that  .
having to pay full price for the games , paying for your console and paying for my internet connection should be more than enough for me to be able to play multiplayer games  .
you are hosting the games on my console anyways all being said and done , if you have been waiting for the right time to buy an xbox , this is it  .
if you own a ps3 you might still not see the point , personally the only games i got were gears of war 1 and 2 and i'm not sure i want anything else for now  .
if you already own an xbox , i say pick this one up when yours rrod' again   p  .
cheers  .
i like consul but i like xbox 360 because it has kinect  .
great product but if you're old system is working fine and you have no interest in purchasing kinect , do not buy  .
otherwsise great product   d huge hard    drive  .
very quite and ez to look at matches my other equipment  .
price is right for all the features    the best 360 so far and i have owned the original ,  .
360 and 360 elite  .
if you are considering this even though you own a elite , go for it updated  .
on jun 24 , 2010  .
i am pleased to have upgraded to the system  .
it is truly whisper quiet  .
tranferring data from the old system to the new system is a breeze with the transfer cable that may take you back another $20  .
however , this is the system to get even if it will only be around for another 2    3 years  .
still the smaller system also allows you to grow your hard drive space if needed , but 260 gigs is more than enough space  .
ms needs to add the hdmi cable as part of the package  .
i am guessing that hdmi cable will become standard in the future and they should look at the possibility of adding blue    ray even though the system plays dvds well  .
if you have the finance or have another system to trade in you should do it now before the trade    ins at ebgames ends in another week or so  .
reserve your copy today because you cannot find these systems in any store by just walking in and asking  .
overall i am pleased to see that ms has finally begun to listen to hardcore gamers such as myself .
looks extremely nice better looking than the ps3 now in my opinion  .
it makes the ps3 slim look very cheap  .
only problem is that i had an xbox pro 60gb for 18 months and it started to look like it is going to get red ring of death but never did so i jumped ship and bought a ps3 slim which is a good console but i do not think it is good enough for a hardcore gamer like me  .
the online is just not good enough and as for graphics yes uncharted 2 is nice but every other game is terrible compared to 360 so to sum this up it looks like a great buy i will post another review when i get mine just to confirm it's greatness but for now i can only wait because it's not released in europe until july 16th .
overall , a good buy especially if you can get the trade    in specials offered by several retailers currently  .
i paid less than $125 for mine by trading in a controller , original xbox 360 , hard drive , and wireless adapter  .
i'm assuming that the kit for kinect compatibility would be at least half of that  .
here's hoping to no hardware issues  .
( cough , cough  right )  .
let me just start by saying that this is my 3rd xbox in 3 years  .
why do i keep coming back  .
it's the games , that's why  .
but honestly , a guy can only take so much abuse if this one fails , i'm just going to stick to my trusty ps3 which has never gone down in the 4 years i've had it  .
i love the 360  .
it's an excellent system with strong , sturdy online support and really fun games (l4d anybody  .
) i is surprised the s is only 17% smaller than the original model  .
it seem smaller , believe it or not  .
the shiny black coating makes it look much more sleek and comparable to the ps3's beauty  .
the system does tend to create high heat so make sure to keep it in a very well ventilated area  .
having it on for an hour creates crazy heat , so you can imagine having a halo marathon yikes overall , the new system does pack a nice 250gb hdd punch and the wi    fi is much needed , particularly when the ps3 already had built in hdd and wi    fi from the get    go  .
i do not like the fact that i have to pay for online play but the 360 does provide a solid , strong online experience rendering it worthy of my money  .
microsoft does need to step up and man up i still freak out sometimes not knowing if my 360 will turn off permanently like the times prior only time will tell , i guess .
first unit purchased came with a broken hard drive  .
called xbox support and they arranged for a replacement hard drive    in 10 business days  .
for my trouble , the lease they could do is fedex a replacement  .
i ended up just taking the unit back to the store for a replacement  .
new unit works great    easy to hook up to internet  .
unfortunately , with my luck so far , i'm keeping the number to xbox support handy .
i still own an original xbox 360 and i'm still happy with it  .
while it may seem petty compared to the rrod , my biggest complaint has always been that the only way to transfer music to the 360 is to rip a cd into it (as opposed to a usb drive)  .
ripping cd's is slow , inconvenient and so 1999  .
i cannot even remember the last time i purchased one  .
i know you can stream music , but i like the idea of custom sound tracks that some games allow you to use  .
c'mon microsoft , come into the now  .
i'm not saying this is a horrible system but it could be much much better  .
i recently got this never owning an xbox before and i am very disappointed  .
i think i should have stuck with my wii  .
i've had the wii for over 2 years with not a single problem  .
i don't know how this is compared to the previous versions since i have not used or owned any  .
personally , it is a waste of money  .
i bough call of duty modern warfare too and had it for only a few days  .
i accidentally nudged the console while the game is in and it made a horrid noise  .
i took the game out and found massive deep scratches all around the disk  .
i tried a disk repair kit and even got it resurfaced which still did not help  .
i also am very upset with how it looks  .
there are fingerprints and smudges everywhere  .
my xbox does not move  .
it stays in the same spot all day  .
how did these marks come about  .
beats me  .
i tried cleaning it , did not work  .
so overall i truly believe this is a complete waste of money and i should have just stuck with me wii .
even with their re    design it will over heat and eat your discs  .
i fear microsoft will never get it right and is incapable of doing so .
oh well i think the new design and the build in wifi are great  .
what i dont like its that it dosent play blue    ray i think i would it be perfect if you guys add a blue    ray reader + an rca or minijack audio output separate somewhere in the console  .
keep it microsoft your better that sony anyways  .
david gomez  .
sanger , ca  .
stick with ypur old xbox people this is a wait of time and money  .
i have an elite that red    ringed on me and is fixed (thanks , ms) and , you know what , i don't need this  .
i'm very happy with what i've got now and to spend another $300 on just a few new items just doesn't make sense to me  .
on top of that , paying another $150 for the really dumb kinect doesn't amount to a hill of beans for me also people , you wanna move around while playing , go outside and exercise  .
jumpa all you want , run , wave your arms to and from , but to move your body just like the avatar in your favorite video game just doesn't fly with me  .
i'll continue my button    mashing while seated , enjoying a beer or two and a snack (no , i am not a fat kid on my ass all day , just a tall , slim 50    yr  .
old who enjoys his gaming the normal way) if you don't have a 360 yet , now is a good time to get this one , otherwise do not waste your $$$  .
with regular cleaning etc , i managed to keep the first generation xbox going until about three weeks ago  .
the rrod finally appeared and would not clear so faced with the x clamp fix or buying a new one with wireless connection etc , i decided to pay for the slim  .
yep , you guessed it    the red light came on within 24 hours and it's now in germany awaiting repair  .
so at least 3 weeks without what i paid for    thanks microsoft  .
having spoken to my local gaming shop , i'm not the first  .
will i buy another  .
can i recommend it  .
buyer beware  .
microsoft made this xbox so that they can sell it along with kinnect  .
they made the price $299 , but in essence , if you get the kinnect , it will total $449  .
what a scam  .
do yourself a favor and keep the xbox you have  .
and spit on the xbox slim signs whenever you see them  .
