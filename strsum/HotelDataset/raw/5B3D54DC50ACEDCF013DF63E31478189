we stayed 5 nights at ht60 situated in the jewish quarter and paid for some extra surprises since it was our honeymoon .
the location was superb ( taxi fare from train station and airport is reasonable ) , you can walk anyway in rome from here ( think trevi fountain , pantheon , colosseum ) and service was usually good , fantastic breakfast too .
trastevere with its happening and delicious trattorias are nearby .
we chose a 2-storey suite with a daybed and the bathroom on the ground floor , however water spilled out onto the floor because of the design of the screen and tub whenever we took a shower .
the bed was extremely comfortable and great after walking all day , a choice of 3 waters ( sparkling , slightly sparkling and still ) was always on offer at the lounge area .
we would 've given them more stars if not for a slight disappointment , which was when we wanted a restaurant booked 2 nights before since it was very hard to get a reservation .
i think they must have been preoccupied at the time so i tried to say it again but the manager made a nod and reassured me it 's all taking care off .
i had a suspicion it was not .
so the next night i checked and sure enough no booking was ever made .
to their credit they tried to make another reservation but it was fully booked , and did make another reservation for us at another restaurant .
all in . . .

all in all apart from a few slip ups ht60 is a great choice when staying in rome.
