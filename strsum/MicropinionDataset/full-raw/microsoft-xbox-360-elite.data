you can use your xbox as a media extender of your pc  .
once you set it up you can then enjoy live tv , recorded tv , pictures , music , and videos on your xbox 360 the same as you would in windows media center  .
only now you get to do it on a big screen hdtv with home theater surround sound instead of a computer  .
infra    red on the xbox360 means it can communicate with a harmony universal remote  .
the ps3 does not so it doesn't jive as well with multimedia geeks  .
strange , since that seems to be who they are marketing to with the built    in bluray player bottom line   as it is with most microsoft products it is not just the product itself but the way it seamlessly integrates with other software (both from microsoft and from others) that makes it so powerful and flexible and gives the customer that much more added functionality that other vendors either cannot or wo not offer .
1) saying the ps3 doesnt have good games  .
god of war series , metal gear 4 , assassins creed , killzone series and yes xbox owners we have mw2 also , its not just you  .
there are plenty more great games with breath taking graphics  .
2) now as for the network  .
to me its great  .
its not slow , all the games play very well  .
i play mw2 an a regular basses and the connection is very solid for my play  .
the only thing bad you can say about the ps3 is it costs $100 more  .
the bottom line here is people , you get what you pay for  .
pay the extra money and get a blu    ray and wifi  .
pay less money and get the cheaper console .
i love the xbox 360 elite because the controller is better than the ps3 and xbox live is better than playstation network  .
great picture quality  .
great selection of games  .
but it has a slight problem with over heating ok as you may already know the xbox 360 has a lot of red ring of death problems  .
sure there are ways to fix this , but wouldnt it just be easier to just avoid it all together  .
first give the console enough room to vent out the heat , at least 12 inches between it and anything els  .
second give it a break if it is downloading consider applying the background download and turning it off until it is done , this cools the console down a whole lot  .
third avoid keeping it on carpet , this causes heat to be kept under the console , only keep on hard surfaces  .
and finaly install your games to the hard drive it takes about 10 minutes per game and about three to four gb of memory , but it is worth it , it not only loads the game faster but it stresses the console less , therfore it does not get as hot  .
(you still have to put the disk in to play the game even if it is installed into the hard drive)  .
overall i would recommend this device to a friend or family member , it is diffidently worth the money .
i like the product because of more games , best online services , 299$  .
to decide which to buy between xbox 360 elite and ps3 slim , i would say you buy both of these gaming consoles because it will only cost you 600$  .
nintendo wii is not at a equal race updated  .
on feb 25 , 2010  .
bottom line it is the best out there , its getting better and better as time goes on .
this is my first x    box  .
i decided on the elite because it is , and still is , the top of the line x    box , and if i is going to spend the money , i might as well get the best one  .
i have no complaints with it , and have never had a problem with it in the 2 years , yes i said 2 years , that i have owned it  .
as for the ring of death i have heard so much about , i have been told that you need to play this thing frequently and for long periods at a time (6 hrs or more every day) to kill it  .
i only play mine a few hours a week at the most  .
i find it funny that people on this sight are complaining about the hdmi port not being 1  .
really  .
who really cares  .
for 99% of the people it does not really matter  .
the unit being noisy  .
the sound of the game drowns it out  .
if you are going to complain find something better to complain about .
best system  .
xbox 360 elite is the best game system available  .
too bad blu    ray won the format war , but until hd dvd drives disapear , i will continue to use hd    dvd as my primary hd video playback .
this is by far the best gamming console out there  .
xbox did the comunity and media features first with graphics that just simple creamed ps2  .
even with the new ps3 out the xbox 360 elite stads by far ahead of the game  .
elite had the builtin hdmi output which makes playing on hdtv's simple and seamless  .
the graphics are one up on the normal 360  .
elite delivers the graphics its just opto your tv to handel the rest  .
looks gr8 has gr8 features and just simply is not comparable to anything else in the market  .
you can but wifim hddvd , stream music , videos and much much more  .
you would think after the dominance of windows that microsoft would have some plan to provide all the users (in other parts of the worl    non    us) with the games they want but distribution of xbox 360 games is fairly poor around the world  .
this is overcomed to some extent through thte xbox live marketplace but i think its important for microsoft to be able to get the games to all corners of the world  .
but i dont blame the console for this so thats why this dsnt affect my rating .
best console in the market .
xbox 360 , and also xbox elite , are top notch if i do say so myself , i own both xbox 360 and ps3 consoles and i must say that sony have put themselves in it this time , with blue    ray and all that , cause if they use blue    ray for games , each game will cost like 200    300 dollars , although they will be very very good  .
and also online gaming is far better on the xbox 360 peace  .
if you want a conscole that does everything this is the one microsoft have really outdone themselves do not bother with a wii or ps3 this one you shall not be dissapointed  .
heres how all you have to do is type this in  .

ref  4544892 then sign up chose from referrals  .
or points then when you get the amount you need they send you one free  .
all  .
i say is try it and be one of a lot of people  .
that did the same thing .
the xbox 360 elite is awesome  .
i just want to say something against the cons  .
yes it's loud  .
but come on you're playing games  .
just turn up the tv volume and there you go if the xbox 360 elite had a build in hd    dvd then it would be more expensive  .
also some people do not have hd tvs so some people are paying for something that they cant use the power supply is big but really come on are you going to be affected by this  .
its not going to affect you playing gears of war or halo 3 the only wires in the system are the power supply and the cables that go to the tv  .
the controller comes wireless  .
there are wired controllers but that separate if you want it the cons made by cnet are very litle things that can be over looked .
well i think the xbox elite has its ups and ups because duh  .
its not aimed at xb 360 owners , its aimed at consumers in general i mean come on , would they really just ask a ps3 owner to buy an elite  .
they might  .
but they wont buy one because theyve made their secret oath to sony  .
and sony has to have its own stuff  .
ex    .
sony television  .
has   to have sony cables , and universals  .
will not work  .
stupid  .
yes  .
reality  .
yes  .
awesome  .
friggin no  .
you must get this console  .
way beter than the wii and ps3  .
its awesomeeeeeeeeee  .

in my opinion this is a must buy console for anyone who is aspiring to enter the next generation of gaming  .
i just purchased this along with three controllers and 4 games (must have gears of war) and this thing is a blast  .
graphics look crisp on my 42 inch lg lcd and sound is just the same as anything else  .
if you really do not have the money (450) to buy the elite , stick with the regular or the core , preferably the regular 360 with the 20gb drive .
the elite is so good  .
go out and buy this system if you have not already  .
if you cannot accord one , then go to this web site and get one for free  .

wow , what a system  .
the xbox 360 elite is everything you could ever want from a video game console , great game selection , full 1080p gaming , 120gb hdd for xbox live arcade , high definition movies and tv shows , xbox live for gaming with people all over the world , a sleek black color , amazing accessories , and  .
an amazing price tag  .
(479  .
compare this to the ps3  .
lacking , rumbleless controller , fingerprint magnet , sub par online service , no hdmi cable included , poor selection of decent games , no online arcade , no downloadable demos , and a $599  .
99 price tag  .
the only annoying part about this system is the bulky power brick , but you can work around it so i gave this system a 10 , because the power brick is not a big deal .
after a day of hearing its sold out man you should have been here earlier dude  .
next morning first of all i ordered it on best buy  .
com and i got it in two days later  .
when the ups guy gave me the box i signed and slammed the door on his face after that i opened the box in excitement i is going to make video review but i did not fell like it  .
i liked the packaging wow  .
free batteries yea yea hdmi cable who cares i do  .
that same day i downloaded all the demos (the good ones like dead rising  .
)i thought it would be better but it looks hot its maaaaaaaa fun  .
my friends had ps3 but he does not like it he wants to buy ps3 me toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  .
i like xbox360 elite so much  .
i have xbox360 premium but i want to change it with the next generation console is elite  .
i like it because more memory for my xbox  .
mostly people like the bigger memory  .
i like it because the xbox360 elite had more gb and the game it so real than sony ps3  .
here's the deal people  .
if you still do not have a 360 , like me , and want to get one , this is the one to get  .
no ifs , ands , or buts  .
yes it is the top of the line but people think it's like going from a kia to a lexus or bmw  .
it's more like going from a bmw 750i to a 750 li  .
you get the same great machine but with just a little more  .
if you have a 360 pass unless you have to have it .
i love video games  .
i have all the consoles , including xbox360 , ps3 , and wii  .
i even love pc gaming  .
but the xbox360 is truely the most amazing and powerful video game machine thus far  .
my xbox360 video games look and play so much better then my ps3 video games  .
it is obvious that the 360 is much more powerful then the ps3  .
also , the amount of stuff and free games that i get from xbox live and live arcade online is unbelievable  .
my ps3 is very dissapointing on the other hand , i cannot find even one game that is worth it  .
i wish i'd spent my ps3 money on more xbox360 games  .
xbox360 games rock  .
this kills the ps3  .
this is the overall buy for the next gen  .
every1 stop being sony lovers .
this machine is sic  .
i have been playing on the premium 360 for many months now with no problems and the gaming is phenomenal  .
also , playing on xbox live adds another dimension  .
the additional hard drive space and hdmi output addresses the need of those who download movies and who have hd sets , respectively  .
great product .
liked every thing about it but one little thing which is , no build in wi    fi , but its ok its not that you cant get online  .
love 360 forever , unless apple comes out with igame or iconsole hahaha lol .
the reason there coming out with the elite is because hdmi is finished yet  .
they could put it out cause it would puh the launch date so far back  .
people should have seen a new xbox 360 coming out , since everyone is talking about how the dont have hdmi  .
when the xbo 360 comes out , then the ps3 is done for  .
the games are horrible and you'll have to wait a long time for a ok release  .
xbox 360 has one of the best games ever  .
its called halo  .
ever heared of it  .
what does playstation have  .
oh yea it has grand theft auto  .
wait no it doesn ; t cause it is releasing on xbox 360 and ps3  .
grand theft auto will be ps3's first good game  .
but you will have to wait until october for it then there is blu    ray vs  .
hd    dvd  .
both really good  .
the blu    ray is going to last  .
its going to drop a lot in price cause no one wants to pay for it and the dvd are $35+ for one dvd  .
that what sony ishoping so they dont lose millions of dollars for putting blu    ray in the ps3  .
plus when it does go down there will better something newer and better and the blu    ray will be another fad the hdmi is great , but for the full use of 1080p you need to spend thousands on a tv and the technology is even there  .
1080p wont last either  .
there already coming out with tv's that are better then plasma's and lcd tv's  .
thats why the price are dropping  .
the xbox 360 is a better buy  .
double the storage then a ps3  .
plugging directly in the back for internet connection is faster then wi    fi  .
and blu    ray is going to last .
this is great for anyone who has not purchased their new next gen consoles  .
the elite system retails at $479  .
also microsoft is selling the 120gb hdd (in gray , price tbd) considering these prices anyone wanting an xbox360 and want the extra storage this system will be much cheaper than buying the hdd alone  .
a new xbox system is $399  .
99 , a 20gb hdd cost $99  .
99 , and lastly an xbox360 elite with 120gb hdd , black snazy casing , and hdmi support for $479  .
99 is a good price  .
where a regular 360 with 120gb hdd would cost same as ps3 all the ps3 flamers should stop it's imature why do you care so much keep your comments to yourselfs  .
besides of all the ps3's i have tried to try , two were locked up and the third locked up two minutes after i started playing (in stores such as eb games and gamestop)  .
games for ps3 too hard to write b/cuz of the processors  .
and the blue ray lags ps3 b/cuz it is so much slower than the current technology  .
bluetooth took a leap and will not be ready for much much longer in the mean time all the titles for ps3 have gone to its main competitor (xbox)  .
microsoft have created a great console , the pro is great , it had is issues (noise and red lights) but they haven't appear in newer systems ( the ones in store now) they keep adding features and options to the gamer and consumer to do more than games with the 360 , the price is nice too , you get hdmi , and 120 gb hd for only 80 dollars more , and the black controllers are beautiful i have a launch 360 pro , and i'm happy with it , it makes its noise , but with the volume of my surround i hardly notice it  .
i do need a bigger hard drive i have been getting many things from the marketplace (which is great , but does need a better and easier interface)  .
well , i'm sure new buyers are going to be extremely happy with it  .
and those that have one like in my case , i already need another one but i'll wait until fall reason why i need another one  .
i do not like to be moving it around , and since i got a hdtv for my room , i should have my 360 there too , and with the gamertag carrying your records and purchases i can connect anywhere with no problems .
this is awsome i cannot wait until it comes out and i will buy it as soon as it comes out  .
first of all all the people that think ps3 is better you might be right but one thing you cannot say that there are better ps3 games than the 360  .
ps3 has nutin like 360 has halo nintendo has mario and zelda whats does ps3 have  .
also the elite has the best memory hardrive  .
and the reason it came late is to beat the new things for ps3 and wii .
while the ps3 may have a nicer console from a hareware perspective , the 360 beats it from a user experience factor  .
xbox live is well worth $50 a year  .
while the ps online is free    it sucks so who cares .
its really your choice ps3 and xbox are very comparable to each    other  .
the console is a wonderful device  .
with a nice matte black finish with chrome details , you cannot ignore this snazzy console  .
the games are even more exceptional with the elite as now it has the full graphic capabilities of a ps3  .
i'm not an xbox 360 fanboy , nor am i a ps3 fanboy  .
i hate the idea of them  .
i will tell you now , the console wars are ridiculous  .
i won't buy a ps3 because i don't use blue    ray  .
blue    ray is too expensive to buy , hd is fine for me  .
even though xbox doesn't supply the worlds greatest hd dvd player if you want one you can get it cheap for $180 aus  .
i like hd dvd it's good  .
or you can buy hd dvd in the online xbox store and play them like a proper hd dvd player should  .
just because the ps3 game 'unchartered 2   amongst thieves  .
won about 27 prizes because of graphics etc doesn't mean it is better  .
one game's graphics doesn't win a fight  .
now the prices are equal so the war is not based on cost  .
except the 'xbox live costs money , lets smash them because they don't have free internet'  .
ok , xbox live 'gold' cost's money , silver is free so if you stick with silver al you pay for is the actual adaptor  .
for the value of online play you get it is worth it  .
when i play on a ps3 i do not enjoy sitting in an empty game  .
basically , the xbox 360 and the ps3 are on par with each other , as what some people say is an upside or downside seems to be the opposite eg  .
too expensive online play' says ps3 owner ' i get better online experience and gaming more people more fun' say xbox owner  .
ps3 owner says i have blue ray  .
l337 p0wn4ge  .
xbox owner says sorry mate , i dont use blue ray , too expensive'  .
see this darn war goes no where  .
but here is the clever solution to decide  .
first    .
what do your friends have (majority)  .
which series do you prefer (halo or mgs)  .
which you like more , such as graphics opinion , sound opinion etc 4  .
price , if you could care , ps3 costs a bit more but the 360 requires an ongoing live fee hopefully this will stop the wars remember i recommend this console purely on gaming experience (graphics , sound , online , gameplay) ect  .
hope you enjoy your console because you cant go wrong with either except the wii thanks  .
well this is a great console in my opinion it's better than the ps3 why  .
because of the great games like halo , gears of war etc , the programs like tversity , mezzmo etc , xbox live's superb service it's compatibility with windows media centre and a range of affordable accessories including the console itself like the hd dvd player , wireless cotrollers , steering wheel , media remote etc .
i love to game on my elite xbox 360 24/7  .
overall , this is still the best console on the market  .
the xbox live component allows users to interact in ways that the ps3 and wii do not  .
additions like the wireless adapter allow you to stream movies from host computers  .
if that add    on it to great , you can simply hook your computer or external hard drive directly into the usb and view recorded pictures , music and movies  .
add ons can get pricey , so be sure to purchase some rechargeable batteries if you use additional components such as guitar controllers , or wireless steering wheels  .
other features such as the ability to stream with your windows live account (msn messenger) , as well as the ability to directly download hundreds of game demos makes this system worth the price .
the elite is my 2nd xbox 360 that replaced my old 360 premium which i ended up selling to a friend of mine  .
my old xbox 360 had the older chipset so i made sure the elite that i got had the falcon chipset the 120gb hard drive is plenty enough to download arcade games , game demos , tv shows , and movies  .
my previous 360 with the 20gb hard drive got filled up too fast i've owned the elite for about 2 weeks now and have been using it every night playing call of duty 4  .
so far the elite has been very reliable  .
it's also amazing when using it on a hdtv  .
i've also downloaded a couple of movies with no playback issues because there is no built in wi    fi i had to buy the xbox wireless adapter which is another $99  .
i also sent in a check for the optional extended warranty for $59  .
90 i is expecting the dvd drive to be quieter than my previous xbox but it is just about the same  .
just turn up the volume a bit and you wo not hear it the rrod can still happen on an elite with a falcon chipset but it's not as frequent as the older versions  .
just make sure the production date is sometime this year and the team location is fdou  .
also make sure that the xbox is in a well ventilated area  .
i ended up getting lot #0805 , team   fdou , production date 1/27/2008 .
i have been a gamer from the start  .
from the atari 2600 , nes , playstation , the original xbox  .
this system is the best one yet with the original nes being a close 2nd  .
the black color choice is great looks good sitting in the enertainment center  .
i like the fact that i can rip music to the hard drive or hook up my mp3 player to it  .
the games for it a great  .
call of duty 4 and halo 3 have been the best so far  .
the only negatives are the big bulky power adapter , you have to hide behind something and the fact that the system is very loud  .
mine sounds like plane trying to take off  .
but i can take all that because once you start playing the games you forget about all the negatives .
if you're a gamer you've most likely chosen your gaming syatem already  .
however if your one of those that are in between and you want to play games  .
buy this , period  .
the only con i have is the hd failure  .
i have the xbox 360 since launch and it took two years for my first one to break  .
that is one i purchased two weeks earlier  .
then the halo edition burn out after one month  .
then my trusted premium from two years ago bit the dust  .
the bright side within 3 weeks all three were back at my door brand new  .
with the 65nn chipset (supposedly no overheating , we'll see) pros    apart from mario and two games on the ps3 you arent missing much chosing the xbox 360 .
the xbox 360 elite has an excellent capability to render the graphics that many new and exclusive titles like halo 3 and mass effect demand the xbox interface has an easy    to    use , modern design and the control that you have over your system is immense when you take into account the different features that allow you to customise your xbox   changing the theme ; accessing xbox live , the community of players where trading game items is possible .
i purchased the elite for my birthday , about four months ago , and along with it i purchased the external hd    dvd drive , and a wifi adapter , also a second controller  .
since then , i have encountered no problems on my elite , although i do not speak for all 360 owners  .
the first thing i noticed in the store is the lack of black accessories , only the white xbox 360 accessories were available  .
i think it is the hdmi , and the 120gb hdd that hooked me  .
although i own a ps3 (60gb) , and a wii (no kidding) i is not satisfied with the online services offered by either console , and xbox live appeared to be my savior  .
ironically though my xbox 360 elite is not compatible with my apple router that has caused nothing but problems (although it works exceptionally well with my imac)  .
i have settled for some great titles , like call of duty 4 , assassins creed , and some xbox 360 exclusives , like halo 3 , forza motosrport 2 , project gotham racing 4 , and bioshock  .
i recommend that current 360 owners do not need to upgrade to the elite , seeing fit that the 120gb hdd is available separately  .
it is often that the elite is compared to the ps3 , yet i feel there is no victor , depending on what you are buying the console for  .
if you are interested in online services , look no further than the elite , and xbox live , but if you want the next    generation format player , look no further than the ps3  .
each console holds there own , but i absolutely adore my 360 controller , compared to my so    so ps3 controller  .
although my ps3 ability to connect to my psp is pretty nifty  .
you have got to love the 360's vibration feature  .
beats some six    axis junk anyway  .
games look great on the elite and the ps3 , but the lack of good titles for the ps3 is disappointing  .
the hdmi connection is good , but you can achieve the same 1080p top resolution with the component cable that comes with the 360  .
wether its worth the extra 50 bucks for the larger hard    drive and hdmi , is a question based on the buyer , who is considering upgrading to the elite , for which it is not , or a person who is purchasing their first xbox 360 , for which the elite is worth it    mainly for its larger hdd .
i have owned my 360 for approximately 6 months and it has become one of my favorite belongings  .
to start with the system comes out of the box with an hdmi cable , and 120 gig hard drive  .
on top of that you have all the other features built into the lower ranking 360's  .
the multimedia capabilities are fairly useful , including ripping cd's and streaming other information from a windows media center installed computer  .
however the lack of hd    dvd and the inability to rip movies may leave some to desire more  .
many great exclusive titles are on the 360 including the hailed halo 3 , gears of war , and the game of the year bio shock  .
i am so far loving my 360 and have no complaints , i did recieve the 3 rings of death however a simple hard    reboot solved my problem  .
lets face it   the xbox 360 is simply the best console currently available  .
the only thing stopping many people from buying it is the price  .
but there is a way around that problem    check out http  //x    box    360    free  .

com for tips on getting a free xbox 360 .

you know you want nextflix or gamefly or satellight tv on your computer  .
9 bucks is the maximum obligation  .
or you can pay shipping and handling and get something as low as 4 dollars  .
then just talk your friends into doing it too and you have a free xbox360 or ps3  .
8 referalls gets a xbox360 or ps3  .
bottom line first   the pros heavily outweigh the cons of this feature    improved high    end xbox 360 console  .
with the 120gb hdd , you'll be able to rip music and download all the content your heart desires for a while (unless you're downloading a large amount of hd content)  .
xbox live is far superior to even many pc online capabilities , and trumps wii and the ps3 without a second thought  .
while the $50 is not desireable , the stability and feature    heavy xbox live/xbox live marketplace and community aspects make it totally worth it at a mere $4  .
09/mo  .
the only change that could be requested is that marketplace content would find more free downloads and arcade games wouldn't exceed $5 but the biggest items for the xbox 360 besides online functionality is the outstanding controller design that is smooth and absolutely intuitive as well as the high    quality exclusive titles  .
bioshock , halo 3 , mass effect , fable 2's guaranteed stardom , forza 2 , pgr4 , skate , guitar hero 2 , gears of war , and the upcoming halo wars give a lot of healthy reasons for buying an xbox 360  .
plus , all multi    platform titles see releases on the xbox 360 and even outperform the ps3 and wii releases lastly , the abundance of wireless accessories including the phenominal racing wheel , allow you to expand your experience with gaming and media  .
while we all wish the hd    dvd player is included , it's still a dream until a (hopeful) announcement in the coming year  .
but do not hold your breath on that  .
plus , with the media center extender and iptv already well into beta    testing , the xbox 360 in general will fully be set apart for media offering with the xbox 360 elite , you get the most well    rounded experience in gaming , media , and performance all for fair prices , no matter which version you invest in  .
plus , microsoft's warranty is now 1 year out of the box , and if anything should short your gaming time , you can send it in no questions asked (short of absolutely destroying your console)  .
it's the console of choice in every area you can think of .
i had to replace a nintendo 64 as my primary gaming system , so anything would have been an improvement  .
while i liked the ps3 feature set , the fact that it has such limited ability to play ps2 games (i need my final fantasy) along with the stratospheric price , and limited game library removed it from the equation the xbox 360 elite offers sold gaming performance , the best online gaming of any console , and the best library of games currently available  .
i just wish i could get metal gear solid 4 .
first i bought a x360 premium , lasted 8 months until i got the dreaded rrod (3red light error)didn't played that much , it is always ventilated , needles to say i is mad when this happen , but when i called the service they were very quick , and only took 5 days to bring me back my console , so i forgot about that very quickly , then the elite came out , and i wanted one , i gave the premium to my nephew , and bought an elite for myself , i always had a problem with hdd space on my premium , but with this console wow , donwloaded tons of things , and still have 78 gb of space free , amazing besides the color of the console and the extra space on the hdd , it's like a regular 360 , nice to include the hdmi cable , the only thing i do not like that much is the fact that any new xbox 360 has the hdmi connector that is supposed to be only in the elite version , i mean it's ok , it's just that if you're going to pay a 100 more for an elite we should get the wifi adapter too , that would be a sweet deal  .
this thing is great , fantastic , wonderful , woo    hoo  .
if you are going to get one , get halo 3 too  .
why do i love it  .
other than graphics  .
ease of use  .
online marketplace  .
ability to connect a camera or mp3 player and watch whatever you have on that on you xbox  .
the hardware  .
im a hardware junky  .
i love hear a the fan and cooling system working its butt off , the hum of the fan , and the warm shell of the xbox as it works  .
to know im pushing it and that its keeping up makes me feel great  .
if i could figure out how to open the case i would love to see how the airflow moves around in the xbox to keep it cool  .
to see the processors , to see everything .
it costs significantly less than a ps3 , and has the best library of hi    def games available  .
the ps3 may catch up in that regard , but until then , this is the system to beat .
just take 1 minute and read this  .
this is very easy to do  .
it literally takes 10 minutes to setup  .
simply follow the steps below  .
i promise you , this is 100% real  .
here is what you do  .
click on the link below , register , pick an account type (referral is the easiest) and complete just 1 offer (very important that you complete the 1 offer otherwise your account will sit in limbo until you do)  .
this is not like other sites where you need to complete one offer on 2 or 3 different pages  .
and a lot of these offers are free trials with nothing else to buy no commitments  .
there are plenty of cool offers to choose from such as blockbuster online , stamp  .
com , netflix , gamefly , zip  .
ca which are services you would regularly sign up for anyways and their all secure networks , why not use them to get a free xbox 360 elite or cash ( i did the stamps  .
com for a 30 day free trial and it never cost me a penny and i received credit for it the same day , you can cancel when ever you want call 1    877    782    6736 to cancel the trial after you order it)  .
another good offer that is easy to complete is by signing up for a free trial on true  .
com  .
after signing up and completing your one offer , simply refer 8    13 people (depending on the free prize you choose) to do the same under your link (just post the same thing as i have on ebay , and you'll get your referrals before the auction even ends  .
then they will ship your 360 elite or your selected item for free , i chose the xbox 360 elite system  .
no joke , 100% real  .
the reason these companies make money , is because most people do not bother getting all the referrals  .
all you have to do is post it on ebay  .
they use us as advertisement by word of mouth which saves them tons of money which goes toward yours and my free gift  .
these are legit companies such as blockbuster , netflix , gamefly etc you can copy my listing if you want  .
you must use your own authentic link though  .
you will get your own personal link after your order is placed step 1   copy and paste this website into your address bar    .

great system , better online gaming that a wii and ps3 , conftorable controllers unfortunately not much different than non elite xboxes , besides hdmi and 120 gb hhd i actually got mine for free , here is how http  //www  .
freewebs  .
com/blindcheesecake/  .
i owned a launch day 360 console that is working just fine , but i decided to upgrade to an elite  .
i chose this because i needed the larger hard drive space and the hdmi output  .
at the time , the elite is the only console that had hdmi support  .
now the halo 3 and premium consoles do as well  .
not too sure about the core console , though  .
anyhow , i like the all black appearance of this unit versus the white premium  .
the unit basically functions the same  .
i have noticed the upscaling on the dvd feature and actually prefer to watch regular dvds on this vs  .
my sony stand alone dvd player  .
the picture quality is good  .
too bad you still have to jack the volume up on your tv in order to hear the movie above the whir and hum of the dvd drive  .
c'mon , mr  .
softie let's get this issue addressed finally  .
the hd    dvd add on makes for an outstanding viewing experience on any tv that can handle a 1080p picture  .
the games and hd movies look outstanding on my xbr2  .
glad i upgraded  .
i did not really need to , but i wanted the hdmi support more than anything  .
maybe the next iteration will include a built in hd dvd drive  .
by techman444    .
the xbox 360 is an amazing console , but the elite is even better  .
the black color provides sleek style and the games for the 360 are absolutely incredible  .
great games include saint's row , gears of war , forza motorsport 2 and test drive unlimited  .
also , the graphics are incredible and look even better on an hd tv the major con of the 360 is the online play , or shall i say , online pay  .
an online account on the 360 is not free , which really stinks the elite is a great buy , and you wo not regret it ____________________________________________  .

xbox 360 elite  .
this is a great overall system that encompasses a lot of great features in this one package  .
essentially this is a super computer that as of now you would be hard spent to match with a desktop pc  .
not mentioning the wide variety of games , which there are , the other multimedia aspects of this system , including the ability to play music , view photos and watch movies off your computer are more than worth the price  .

allen  .
i had my xbox 360 premium for about a year and loved it to absolute bits  .
i loved it so much , i decided to settle down and buy an hdtv  .
[i decided on the samsung ln    t4061f  .
it's a good choice for a $1500    range 40 lcd  .
] with 3 available hdmi inputs , i really felt like i should be using at least one  .
so , for my love of the xbox 360 , i bought an elite and sold my premium to a friend upon first boot    up , i is surprised by how silent the fans were compared to my may    2006 premium  .
[my elite is a june    2007  .
] i couldn't really hear the thing  .
this is almost worth the upgrade to begin with  .
the disc drive is still pretty loud when spinning a disc at full speed , but not as loud as my old 360  .
still , when watching dvd's as we often do , it's nice to not hear the 360 at all the picture quality is pretty improved over vga  .
during gaming , you wouldn't notice much  .
but on still scenes / dashboard , the image is intensely sharper and less muddy  .
this makes me want to upgrade the pc connection from vga to a dvi    to    hdmi adapter for my macbook pro  .
to be honest , only the real video    philes will love the hdmi over the vga  .
most average consumers would probably shrug and say yeah  .
but aside from the picture quality , it is also nice just having a single usb    sized cable for both 1080p output and digital surround  .
hdmi sure is convenient thanks must also be given to microsoft for going out of their way to include not only comonent cables but the hdmi itself  .
the ps3 is fine and all , but you think sony could have been a little nicer and include at least component cables  .
an hdmi only takes what , $0  .
45 to manufacture  .
maybe less but no dice  .
the option to use hdmi in conjuction with composite or optical audio via the special dongle is also top    notch in my personal opinion , the ivory color of the premium system is pretty good , and i never complained , but the black casing of the elite along with my tv just plain completes the look  .
black tv , black speakers , black ps2 ivory 360  .
something is out of place , and now it fits in like a glove  .
unfortunately , the hd    dvd player is not available in black       so if i ever decide to get one , i'm back to one out    of    place component again  .
shrug   .
the hard drive is high capacity  .
not much to say on that matter  .
higher capacity    more possibility for stuff  .
moving entire music library onto it  .
really , if you are jumping new into the 360 universe and have an hdtv , take the time to spend the little extra to get what the elite offers  .
if you do not have an hdtv , the elite could boil down to a preference in color for you , or a matter of future    proofing your investment for when you get an hdtv  .
either way , i'm glad i moved up  .
my premium served me well , but now it's going to serve my friend in its next line of duty .
would you like a free xbox 360 elite or $480 in cash  .

mike  .
it's super quite then my previouse 360 premiume , looks and sounds better to because of hdmi and better grafics chip .
i will admit that those who bought the premium xbox will not be benefiting from buying this new one  .
but as that this is my first one , it is a good machine  .
people should not be shocked or upset that a system will come out with upgrades  .
ive had no overheating problems yet (knock on wood)  .
and i dont mind not having a hd player , first of all i hear they are too loud so i will just wait to get teh next version of the hd player for xbox or just buy a standalone when they drop in price at thanksgiving or christmas  .
people need to stop complaning that a game system does not have a hd player  .
it is made for gaming  .
if you want a dvd player go buy one or get a ps3 which has very little good games and an even worse live server  .
so in conclusion , the system is great for first time owners , and to those who bought the premium , wait and buy the next upgraded system in november .
great system , this is my first xbox360  .
i got my system for almost a week now and have not got any problem yet  .
i got the sysemt for free at this link   http  //www  .

i signed up for 1 offer and refered 10 people and i got the system within 2 weeks after i fullfilled the requirement  .
i signed up for the stamp  .
com offer because it's free for the first month and i cancelled it before the trial offer over i is skeptical at first but it really works .
hard to justify spending $ 479 if you already own a 360 premium , but if this is your first 360 it's def worth the extra cash .
all in all this one of the greatest next    gen systems i have ever seen  .
this has got to be the fastest console i have ever bought games for  .
within exactlty 30 minutes of buying it on tuesday , i spent 12 straight hours on gears of war nonstop  .
just for bathroom breaks and a sandwich  .
top notch batteries helped out here  .
i had no problems hooking it to windows media and recording adult swim  .
bill gates really is the ultimate machine  .
as a first time xboxer , i could not be more happier  .
good luck sony , your gonna need lots of it .
this is the best console i own both ps3 and now the xbox 360 elite let me tell you im selling my ps3  .
great gaming system  .
cnet review did not review the actual performance of console  .
this is where the elite out performs sony and nintendo consoles .
this is just a slightly improved version of the original 360 , sporting hdmi support [cable in box] , a generous epoxy coating around the cpu/gpu to prevent the bga connection from popping loose when the board warps[result   red ring of death ] , and the obvous bigger hard drive  .
the color change , while officially being called black matte , comes off as more of a dull black or dark grey and has a slightly cheap look to it , though it should still blend better with most existing home theater components than the ipod white of the original  .
also notable is the fact that the controller and system are different shades of black  .
a worthwhile buy if you don't have one , and worth trading in for if you do  .
thought it does not have all of the features of the ps3 , and it's share of shortcomings , with the polished state of xbox live and the plentiful selection of games[not to mention cross platform gameplay emerging] the elite is giving microsoft a more decided edge over sony  .
i admire their[sony]free live use , and the system is definitely a powerhouse of features and processing capability , but they need to do a major overhaul of their online gameplay , and score some big titles to really compete with the 360  .
with sales falling behind even that of the wii it is getting lots of negative press , but i'm sure sony still has an ace or two up it's sleeve  .
a white ps3 god version perhaps  .
i cannot wait to see how it plays out .
i bought the xbox 360 elite yesterday and so far i love everything about it  .
i am not a hard    core gamer (i have not owned a game console since the nintendo 64) , but i wanted a next    generation console and decided to wait a bit  .
i hooked up the xbox to my samsung 32 hdtv and it looks amazing  .
i have only played call of duty 3 so far , but i have to say that i'm very impressed with the graphics and gameplay  .
i'm also getting halo 3 as soon as i can  .
i like that there are many games for the xbox 360 right now  .
the included wireless controller is great (my wife liked the fact that there will not be cables lying around)  .
the included hdmi cable is a plus considering these can be expensive  .
i watched a couple of episodes of 24 using the xbox and i have no complaints as far as quality  .
i cannot find a difference between the xbox dvd player and my current lg dvd player  .
they both up    convert very well with no visible differences  .
the 120gb hd might be a little too much , but i would rather have more space than i need than just enough i cannot speak for those of you who already own an xbox 360 , bur for those of you who don't , i think the xbox 360 elite is a great choice for only $80 more than the premium version  .
i know the ps3 has better hardware , but it's too expensive , i don't really want a blu    ray player , and i do not need my game console to have wi    fi .
consoles , like pcs , should be updated more often  .
it's ridiculous to wait 5    10 years between updates  .
sony has actually been quoted as saying the have a life expectency for the ps3 of 10 years  .
10 years  .
what a dumb thing  .
technology changes at the speed of light  .
i applaud microsoft for updating their system already and i hope they do it again in another 2 years and every 2 years after that  .
know about moore's law  .
well , it's always held true and if it continues to be the case , in just 3 years , there will be technology cheaply available enough to blow away any console out today    and sony wants the ps3 to sell for 10 years before they update it again  .
just bad  .
at the same time , microsoft should do away with their $299 system and drop the price of the $399 system to $329 and then price the elite at $399  .
at this stage in the game , they cannot be losing much money on making the console  .
they are probably breaking even or making money  .
they should not worry yet about making money  .
make the system affordable to not just keep the lead over ps3 , but to grow it and catch wii  .
so , i do think they are making a mistake here  .
at $479 , it is too close to the ps3 pricing now  .
toss in the $199 hd dvd player and it exceeds the ps3  .
so , they are too close for comfort there  .
after 2 years on the market , it's time for a price drop .
it is fantastic , it has just what the xbox needed but it came out too late and that is what most people have been focusing on , but despite that it is perfect  .
the elite system is really geared towards the people that already have a hdtv and really want to show it off  .
but if you don't have an hdtv and like the look and the 120gb , you do not need an hddvd drive  .
that's why the 360s are cheaper than the ps3 in the first place  .
you cannot go wrong with either the elite or the normal 360 , especially when halo 3 comes out  .
i do really like the expanded hard drive for all the new shows that the marketplace is coming out with though , good move .
alright , i cannot believe how stupid some of your reviews are  .
first of all , ms is not aiming this product at current 360 owners  .
duh  .
would they  .
they don't expect current owners to pony up more $$$ secondly , one of you completely left out the fact that the hdmi output is included  .
omg it's only 1  .
2 and not 1  .
how dare they  .
gimme a break  .
you clearly cannot please everyone  .
if ms had released it with 1  .
3 , people would complain about that  .
ms will always be this evil corporation that can do no right lastly , who needs a 120gb hd  .
people who know that iptv is being developed , that's who your reviews are void if you're a fanboy  .
make an objective review of the product , do not bash it purely to bash it  .
it's hilarious how anti    ms everyone is  .
yet , if apple does the same thing , it's ok .
first off i've had both the ps3 and the xbox360 , and there is no way in the world the ps3 is better my ps3 is just sitting there collecting dust the controller on the ps3 is terrible and to really enjoy a game you need the vibration which only the xbox has the xbox360 has a better graphics card this is why the games available on both systems look better and are smoother on the xbox360 rather than the ps3 the procesors are about evenly matched , except sony took a chance with the cell procesor because it isnt made for gaming dont just take my word for it read the reviews by the pros google it take it from me , dont waste your money on a ps3 ( i sold mine on ebay after 1 month) , you will play it for one week then it will just collect dust xbox online is exceptional and set new standards for the next generation gaming as far as the new elite system , i think that for the same price they should've included the hd    dvd player  .
if microsoft can pull that off even though it would be a small loss as far as their cost for each unit , they will take the majority of the video game market and in return they would make their money back by the video game sales maybe ms doesnt care since the 360 is alreay outselling the ps3 3 to 1 as of the ps3 launch date and there are also 10 times as many 360 owners as there are ps3 owners (that number is only going to go up since the 360 is outselling the ps3 now 3 to 1)  .
i dont know why these sony fan boys keep saying that the ps3 is better under the hood , but the cell procesor has not proven anything as of now as mentioned earlier the graphics look better on the 360 and the game play is also smoother on the 360 if in the future the ps3 can outdo the 360 and if they get a better game selection ( better than the 360) then i will go and buy one once again  .
but intil then it is not a good investment to pay almost $700 w  .
tax for a system w  .
no games and inferior graphics , gameplay , and terrible controller , and you dont even know if blue ray will become obsolite in a very short time bottom line , both systems look similar but the 360 has more to offer if in the future the ps3 can out do the 360 then i'll buy one then but for now i'll stick with a system i can actually use for more than a week .
i think this system is awesome , luckily i is able to trade    in my original 360 for some credit towards this one  .
it has all the connections you need for pure hd gaming and digital surround sound  .
the 360 games blow the competition away  .
sorry , wii are not amused by cutesy graphics or cheap call of duty/gears of war hybrid knock    offs  .
i know own both an elite and a gen  .
ii 360 .
no hd dvd player and built in wifi  .
but other then that iptv could be huge depending on price structure to be able to use the 360 as a tivo device for tv also 1080p and to bump the res from 1080i to 1080p on all games should clean them up a bit also lets see the ps3 update that lets you pick the resolution and not the game  .
ya i know ps3 will run what ever res you set it at in the dash but games control the res in games also who like exclusive gamertags and achievements that would be me  .
also built in voice communication support for game and people who have a headset 3    5 headset outta 32 gamers in resistence is lame ps3 fan boy you paid a mint for your system get a flippin headset or throw it in the trash youll never match live with out the trash talk on deathmatch i powned your mom you stink like a babies diapper you get the picture  .
of course i would never talk about your mom or would i  .
maybe if talked about mine first  .
also the next xbox to watch for is the one with a shrunk processor that runs cooler and use less power and hd dvd built in  .
ps the ps3 uses 385 watts the 360 uses 165 watts  .
i can run 2 360 for less then 1 ps3 something too consider with energy cost going thru the roof  .
overall a great gaming machine .
overrall this is the console with the best games of this generation , however the power unit and the noise kept it from scoring higher in my book  .
i like this console , but not as much as my ps3  .
i like xbox live because i can chat with friends and keep track of achievements throughout games  .
i like the games and the classics  .
the warranty is second    to    none what i did not like about the xbox 360 is the noisy dvd drive that scratches disc even when the console shakes just a little bit  .
the console heats up pretty easily and i get scared of the red ring of death  .
i need to buy a wireless network adapter for wi    fi  .
no blu    ray disc means that games are shorter and require more disc to fill up a 50 gb game it is a good console , but it is missing a few things here and there  .
take it from me  .
i only bought this system for the games .
i bought the elite version the day halo 3 came out  .
i love this thing the online is by far the best online service for a console  .
this thing has a huge hard drive and produces great graphics and sound  .
the dvd drive and the fan are very loud  .
xbox live is cool but its cost money to use it  .
overall i like this system very much .
the elite not for casual gamer but if your a serious gamer then this is well worth it  .
having all the memory is nice  .
having a black xbox is awesome it makes it very unique  .
hi    def cables come with it which is nice  .
buy them sepreatley and there a 100 dollars  .
you might want to buy your own mic because the one it comes with is medioker  .
another disadvantage is having to buy a 100 dollar wireless connector for xbox live  .
but overall a nice console .
the xbox 360 is a serious piece of kit  .
it's not for everybody , but if you want high def gaming , then it's a logical choice unless you want a ps3 and in that case , buy a ps3 otherwise , buy an xbox , it's 3 processors spank the ps3's cell processor for all but number    crunching ; and let's face it , you want number    crunching , buy a cray .
i myself have an xbox360 elite with all the good games and movies , and boy , i'd rate this 10/10 any day , just microsoft did not perfect it since the last edition (360)  .
it burns out like hell after 4    6 hours  .
i love all of microsoft's technologies and games , but this is the worst  .
xbox360 and the elite are the same , just bigger harddrive and different color  .
i am not telling you to not buy this product , just to make sure you have 911 ready to dial incase there is a fire .
i've been debating the whole xbox/ps3 hd/blue ray war for some time now  .
finally , my girlfriend buys me an xbox elite for christmas  .
yes , the dvd drive is somewhat noisy , but if you have your television or home theater turned up to an entertaining level ( i don't mean blown away) , you do not hear it  .
the graphics are outstanding on my 1080p sharp aquos via hdmi  .
so far , my console has played every type of dvd disc that i own (dvd+r , dvd    r , dvd+r dl)  .
i've had the question in my head , should i return this and buy a ps3  .
well , i think the answer is just buy both of them  .
you cannot really go wrong  .
you get two game consoles and the ability to play both blue ray hd dvd formats , as well as standard dvd  .
the ps3 is much nicer as a media center , but that should not be the main focus for buying a gaming console  .
the elite has hdmi built in and with it's black finish , it looks more like a part of a home entertainment center .
i got this after my original 360 pro went to xbox heaven  .
this 360 is what microsoft should have orignally put out on the market when they launched the console  .
the 120gb hdd is perfect for people who download material off of the internet or store music/videos  .
the hdmi is the way to go for hdtv owners and it still comes with regular cables for those who have not made the switch yet  .
the black is sooooo much better than the white casing so now it matches all my other a/v equipment and is not an eyesore the cons  .
they could've slimmed down the monster psu brick and gone to a slot loading design on the odd  .
i'm ok with no hd    dvd as it is not a proved format yet  .
the worry of the ring of death is still there .
just to start , i will not do the ps3 comparison thing as both are good consoles and my comparison is moving from pc gaming to the xbox and there is no comparison  .
the xbox is superb , i have also hooked up the wireless adaptor and hd dvd and they work perfectly at 1080p  .
no comments plse , i have a 70 inch hd box and need it  .
the whole thing works perfectly , gaming is great , the online experience is second to none , picture quality is superb and i can stream hd vidoes from my pc without stutter using a belkin n1 router i know that there are a lot of microsoft knockers out there but in this case i cannot fault their xbox range  .
i bought the elite after i played it at my friends house  .
it really makes internet gaming seamless  .
the flat black look is awesome , although the ps3's glossy finish makes it look classier  .
in terms of gaming , the ea titles look the same to me  .
i have this hooked up to a sharp 720p and enjoy it  .
i just wish the power supply is integrated  .
if you were to lay bricks and you were short one , the power supply would look like a great candidate  .
for a machine that has great ergonomics , it looks hideous next to that power supply  .
i dont have room to hide it  .
i did not buy it because of its looks , but i just hoped microsoft would put some effort in that .
i had the pro console , it lasted 5 months before it died (manf  .
date 12    17    2006)  .
returned it to gamestop and is able to upgrade to a new elite w/ a manf  .
date of 6    21    2007  .
yes i have a hdtv w/ a hdmi port so this elite system is what i wanted to begin with , plus w/ two boys downloading everything from the marketplace i needed the extra 100gb hhd space  .
halo 3 is going to be awesome  .
i only gave this a rating of 8 due to the fact this system gets very hot  .
if and when this elite dies i will upgrade again to the newer system w/ the smaller chips , then i will update my rating  .
i find this xbox cool and all but i have a few questions for those of you who have one with the xbox 360 play and charge kit it lets you play and charge so does that mean w1hen you buy it it starts off with a full battery and you keep on charging it till it's full to play and doe you have to have an hdtv to get great graphics and is it really true that you have to pay to play online pls comment to answer and im gonna buy mine in tokoyo so is it gonna be hard to change the lang or will it come in eng  .
it is evident that a lot of the bad reviews on here are from people who are mad that they bought an older xbox 360 and got ripped off in the process  .
i do agree that microsoft should've produced a system such as this to begin with , but they would've probably lost a lot of money on it  .
as this is my first xbox 360 , i say that it is a great system and when halo 3 comes out , you wo not be able to pry me away from this thing no matter how hard you try .
the only reason i purchased the elite is because my premium got the 'ring of death' 2 weeks prior to the release of the elite  .
the black finish is nice , the 120 gig hd is really nice , not having to worry about cleaning up hd every couple of weeks now  .
hdmi is nice but not noticible on my t  .
from the component cables , but i is disapointed to see that the dvd drive is still too loud , the whole unit still gets very hot , due to the fact there is no 65nm chipset yet (that would have been great  .
) and still no hd    dvd included , not a big deal for me , but would have been nice , i would have spent the extra money .
yes did i just buy this 2yrs ago ,  .
basiclly this is the 360 that micro    puff should have come out with at the start so whats up micropuff why jerk 479 off me  .
could they have not just make the 360 hdmi a upgrade for later use at less tug in the hd dvd cheap jokers  .
dont let me get started  .
anyway the hdmi really makes a differance to the hd couch rats life  .
it's the chees the grafics look a tad bet sharper on my 1080p as hdmi tends to transfer everything in digital better color without the glow just flat clean pictures very nice i thought even when the xbox logo came on i could tell this is a real step in the right direction  .
it just looked more hd    def  .
the elite is a dumb name to me i mean why not 360 hdmi you know something less like a introduction  .
but thats micro puff 4u i have the ps3 but not the wii no    hd    no    wii 4    me what is wrong with them comming out hd    less r u craz e its 2007 you now it safe to come out the 90's in all if u have the money and are a into hd like jerry on cheezz then the 360 is a nice add on in gaming enjoyment you will like the hi deff upgrade and the 120 gigs do come in handy for movie downloads  .
so its your money 2 me its bearly worth it but because of the online gaming i got it you will have fun with a 360  .
i received an xbox 360 premium for christmas and decided to trade in this unit for the new one  .
gamestop is offering a $250 credit towards the purchase of the elite when you traded in an xbox 360 premium  .
i traded my old system and a bunch of games that i no longer play  .
i walked out the door only having to pay $85  .
00 for the new unit (less than the cost of the new hdd) if you're reading this review you already know what is new with the system and what is not so i won't go over what has already been covered  .
if you're an existing xbox owner and are trying to decide whether or not to get the elite then perhaps my feedback can be of some use to you  .
i'll break down what i think of the new features  .
+color    this version of the elite is the only version that will be in black  .
microsoft has said that it plans to go back to the white color scheme when this initial batch of the elites has sold out  .
so if black is a big selling point for you now is the time to get it +hdmi    this is a big selling point for me as it is the only way i could get 1080p from my external hd    dvd drive (i do not have a vga connection on my plasma)  .
unfortunately the version of hdmi implemented is 1  .
i have read that this is because microsoft had the elite in development before the 1  .
3 spec is finalized and the chipsets available  .
if that is the case then microsoft has been planning the elite for some time as sony released the ps3 with hdmi 1  .
3 for me not having hdmi 1  .
3 is not a big deal  .
as cnet (and other sources) have pointed out the 360 is not the best dvd player out there  .
even the external hd    dvd attachement cannot compare to the xa2 but it was not designed for this purpose  .
i'd rather have a better performing dvd player with hdmi 1  .
3 than a mediocre one with hdmi 1  .
3 (360)  .
perhaps this will change with the next 360 update the first week of march bottom line   if you want the best high def dvd player with all the bells and whistles get a dedicated blu    ray/hd    dvd player  .
if you use the xbox for games and the occasional movie then hdmi is not a big deal  .
if you are an 360 owner and have the hd    dvd drive and your tv can receive 1080p over hdmi then it might be worth your while if you cannot afford a high end high def dvd player  .
a bonus is the included hdmi cable which might save you some bucks  .
i'd recommend purchasing hdmi cables from reputable online retailers like cyberguys  .
you'll get a much better deal than going to fry's or best buy and buying monster hdm cables +120gb hdd    this is a worthy upgrade for existing 360 owners  .
especially if you are a heavy marketplace user and enjoy downloading demos and trailers  .
the cost of the drive is pretty steep ($179) but worth it if you need the space bottom line   if you just play 360 games and don't use live or rip audio then you probably don't need a larger hdd  .
the cost of the drive is pretty pricey so you might want to consider trading in your existing 360 and some games to see if you can get an elite for what the hdd would cost you  .
this way you'd get more for your money +dvd drive    everyone is hoping microsoft would include a better performing dvd drive with the elite  .
this unfortunately did not happen  .
the drive in the elite is actually quieter than the drive used in my premium system  .
this could be because a different vendor is used this time around or there were some slight design tweaks  .
my previous system got very loud when i exited a game and the disc started to slow  .
this no longer happens bottom line   no upgrade here  .
+content    i had thought that microsoft would include some new content on the elite since there is so much space available  .
in an on10  .
net interview microsoft's albert penello said there would be specific content included on the hard drive  .
i is hoping for a forza 2 demo , maybe a halo 3 trailer (or multi    player beta) or some other goodies  .
there is nothing on the elite that does not currently come with the premium  .
everything is exactly the same which is rather disappointing conclusion   nothing special comes with the elite other than the hdmi cable and the new audio breaker box  .
sure it comes in black and you now have a larger hdd and hdmi connector but this is not a big deal if all you do is use your 360 for games  .
microsoft probably tried to play it safe and not upset existing 360 owners more than they already have  .
if they would have included wifi , a better dvd , or more usb ports that would have really made people mad personally i think it would have been a better idea to do this  .
this unit is called the elite which is really a misnomer  .
microsoft has already announced that it will be discontinuing the core system  .
the premium would be the new  core  system while the elite will be the higher end unit  .
with future elites going white the only difference between the premium and the elite is hdmi and a larger hard drive  .
when compared to the ps3 the elite is not that elite after all .
first    this hasn`t been released yet  .
and i don`t think an honest review of the product can be made so far  .
screw the ps3 vs xbox flamers that keep   over their favourite console`s competitor if you`re a 360 owner already , this is not a very welcome addition from microsoft cuz it probably pisses you off that you don`t get it and its not a good buying option for you  .
but this console isn`t on the market for 360 owners i feel your pain , but   , no1 wans to hear you ranting about it now , if you`re in the market for a next    gen console , the 360 elite has alot to offer you pros     .
actually , huge library of games (in comparison of ps3)  .
tho in a year or so it may even out 2  .
faster loading times for games (vs ps3)  .
multi platform games are being developped for the xbox first , so the other versions are usually less good 4  .
game developpers find it more easy to develop games on the xbox due to its 3 general    purpose processors  .
that probably means that more games will come out on xbox360 5  .
included headset , hdmi cable  .
(ps3 dont)  .
controllers have a good feel  .
(ps3 dont)  .
possible hd    dvd capability (for an extra $200)  .
i put this as an advantage because , if you dont want it you dont pay for it  .
and if you want it , well its better to have a separate unit play your high def dvds , this way you don`t use up your console  .
(remember how playing dvds made your last gen consoles screw up) 8  .
peer to peer online (vs ps3 dedicated servers  .
) well even if this usually means more lag in games , it also means developpers don`t have to spend extra money to include online support in their games  .
ps3 devs must run dedicated servers which cost them money  .
and no1 guarantees they will support it forever 9  .
games look better  .
go read reviews about it  .
no arguing here  .
not bcuz the 360 is a better machine but see #3 and #4 10  .
because it is released first , has the market advantage cons     .
you pay for online (ps3 is free)  .
game developpers have to develop games with minimal hd use to accomodate all 360 owners since ms had the great idea to release a hd    less version of the 360 3  .
machine is less powerful than ps3  .
more limited in capacity  .
might be overcome by ps3 2    3 years from now 4  .
360`s have a history of breaking down at a freaky rate  .
some people report having to change their xbox up to 5 times since its release due to console failure  .
thankfully microsoft replaces them (with refurbished parts)  .
don`t know if the new elite will be fixed , but buy the store exchange program if u can  .
(ps3 has had reports of console probles also , but comes nothing close to the plague    level of broken 360`s)  .
xbox is sided with hd    dvd , a media that will probably lose the high definition media war due to its weak marketing strategy 6  .
nothing is free with xbox live 7  .
lack of good rpg games in its libary  .
sony is known to hold the exclusives with many japanese rpg developpers  .
too bad 8  .
wireless internet connection is not included and costs $120 cad (for the ms part) you can find a regular part for half that price though  .
(ps3 has it included)  .
bottom line     .
what makes this console a better choice has nothing to do with its specs as it is inferior to the ps3 in that area  .
its the gaming community`s choice because a) it is released first b) has more games c) game developers like it more , making it the first choice price is not and advantage at all with the 360  .
if you put both consoles in comparison , the 360 actually costs more  .
that is if you want it to have high def media capacity and wireless internet capability like the ps3 a tough choice , but i`m going for the 360 elite when it comes out hoping it wont break for a while .
the elite seems to be a worthy update to the xbox 360 but some features seem to little to late and just seemas a response to the ps3  .
ms should have discontinued the hd    dvd add    on as well  .
if they included an hd    dvd drive in this , almost all current 360 owners would have jumped in head first  .
120gb hdd is like killing an ant with an atomic bomb  .
it's just overkill  .
i'm not bashing ms in anyway  .
in truth , 90% of my components are sony , except my console  .
i just love the xbox live experience  .
nevertheless , if anyone is considering the 360 , wait for the elite  .
at $479 its a steal , with a free ($100) hdmi cable to boot  .
just do not get caught in the upconversion hype  .
your current stock of dvds will not look like dicovery hd no matter what you do  .
i agree with many stating that they feel bamboozled by micro$oft (including myself) because most would've spent the $500 to purchase the best system micro$oft had to offer at the time  .
now the premium users are left out in a way  .
sure small things like a new color , bigger hard drive and finally hdmi support are there but this should've been offered at launch time and not a year and a half later that said , there's only a few things as previously mentioned that are worth the added price  .
luckily we can at least upgrade the hard drive and can still see hd games/movies  .
however , to infuriate more users , micro$oft should've included a modular drive so that elite owners could upgrade to a nice internal hd dvd drive down the road  .
you figured they would think of going all out if they were going to p1ss a lot of people off  .
oh well my two cents .
i live in canada and the price of xbox360 elite is only 50 dollars more than premium  .
i also think that this is going to hit sony like a punch in sales  .
this is obviously going to intimidate sony .
overall this product plays video games amazingly well with a very fun , and creative on    line gaming community  .
the sound quality is also excellent  .
but just be ready to accept the problem (read down below) before deciding to buy one the biggest problem is its hardware failure rate and trying to deal with overseas customer service when this happens  .
upon getting my last xbox 360 elite repaired , i had to call customer service 10 times and wait about 5 weeks until they returned me a refurbished console  .
if you have patience for defective hardware then this will not bother you as much .
first i must say i really enjoy the xbox  .
you already know why you want this machine  .
i bought my elite right before the release of halo3  .
i waited hoping that i would get the latest version of the xbox360  .
i waited till after all the bugs where worked out by the early adopters  .
the stories of overheating i attributed to noobs packing their console into too tight a place  .
the loud fan and drive noises had plenty of time to be corrected  .
this is what i thought after only a few months the happy green glow ring on my console turned red i found that this means my xbox now qualifies for a free all expense paid round trip to mc allen , texas  .
once there it will spend february in a rehab facility where it can cool off while attending the mandatory xbox360 factory reunion  .
i am still waiting for my revised texbox360 to return home but it is march now and it is spring break and texas is warm & & & updated  .
on mar 20 , 2009  .
ps3 is so much nicer looking , so much more streamlined and has blu    ray , true wireless and bluetooth  .
use my cell phone plantronics 220 bluetooth headset for online gaming  .
used my logitech keyboard and hooked up to my linksys router (no cables)  .
all that is on my ps3 is an hdmi cable and a power cord (no huge power brick)  .
blu    ray dvd movies look awesome  .
xbox better start making some genuine hardware improvements like hdmi 1  .
3+ , wireless and off the shelf hard drives  .
basically the ps3 is just a superior piece of hardware  .
if you do not mind buying everything separate then get an xbox360$$  .
when the ps3 games start comming out (soon)the xbox360 technology will not be able to keep up  .
this is true with high def games  .
blu    ray can store upwards of 50gig per disk  .
the games will be mind blowing .
this is my third xbox 360  .
i got this one to replace my previous 360 , which failed like the one i had before that  .
it's cool because the elite features the 120 gb hard drive for all you media buffs out there , as well as a hdmi cable for those of you with a hdtv  .
the black finish looks a lot better than the white look , which ironically made the 360 look like something from apple  .
however , the xbox 360 premium is just fine if you only need a hard drive for saving games and do not have or plan to get a hdtv  .
a built    in hd    dvd player would have been really nice , but you still have to shell out another $200 for that option microsoft recently extended its warranty to 3 years to address the red rings of death issue  .
thats really cool of them but it would have been better if they had fixed the actual problem instead  .
360 still has the best game line    up out there so despite the quality issues , its still a better buy that the ps3 .
overall i must say i'm very pleased with this system  .
i own both this and a 60gb ps3 , and spend significantly more time playing games on the elite  .
the primary reason being the 360 has a much more vast array of games the controllers are fantastic , as are all 360 controllers  .
reasonable battery life , extremely responsive , and well designed the elite itself hasn't received any huge makeovers over the other systems  .
however , when color is an issue , it's nice to have a choice in the matter  .
(note   www  .
colorwarepc  .
com does offer quality paintjobs for all game systems)  .
for $100 more , you're gaining a black system and a bigger hd  .
(hmm reminds me of apple laptops  .
) of course it also includes hdmi connectivity a must    have for the ultimate gaming experience the major issue i have with this system is the drive noise  .
it's obnoxious to say the least  .
but with the proper home theater system , you can drown it out pretty well  .
the noise doesn't seem to change whether it's standing vertically or horizontally the only other note is that it does get pretty warm  .
ensure that you have some space for the air to move  .
i do not recommend the aftermarket intercooler , as it simply increases the overall noise from the system flaws aside , this system is the best choice for the avid gamer  .
with an enormous collection of games , hdtv compatibility , and the hard drive space to act as a media center , the 360 elite is a no    brainer .
i think this is a really good console , the best you can possibly get right now  .
it is black , but i think instead of wasting time putting a hdmi drive in , because almost no one has a hdtv , they should have put in the power brick internally .
xbox 360 is my first game console , i is so impressed with gears of wars and many titles it offers the black version is my second xbox 360  .
i traded in my premium verson of xbox bacause it regularly show up the red rings of death  .
i chose to trade in and buy this new one because it will cost me more just to repair it .
this review is for the xbox 360 premium , not the elite  .
the 360 is a good system  .
the games are great  .
you have plenty of games to choose from it has a progressive scan dvd player (after you get the spring update) wireless controllers , and the ability to stream photos , videos , and music from your computer  .
its a great system  .
the wireless controllers have great range and long battery life  .
the system has amazing graphics and it sounds great if you have a good surround sound system  .
xbox live is a great online community  .
even though you have to pay for it (if you want to do something besides chat and download) its worth it  .
its easy to use matchmaking , achievements are great to compare with friends and it supports messenger now  .
the blade menu is also very easy to use  .
the disadvantages are loud fan noise , microtransactions (paying money for gamer pics and wallpapers  .
) small hard drive (bigger one is available but i mean come on $180 for a 120gb hdd  .
) , huge power supply and reliability  .
i had my first system for about a month before it gave me the ring of death (3 red lights) and i only played that system maybe 2 hours a day if i played at all  .
my second system seems to be ok but i've only had it for about 2 months  .
it does stutter from time to time (my first system didn't stutter at all) but if thats the tradeoff for more reliability i'll take it  .
even so i got the extended warranty from microsoft  .
unfortunately the first time the system went out i found out it would take between 4    6 weeks to fix  .
so basically i is stuck with a hard drive , games , and controllers i couldn't use for over a month not to mention an xbox live account i had paid for that could not be used during that time either  .
so repair time is the bad thing but hey , thats with any warranty right  .
overall i'm satisfied with the 360  .
when its working its a great system to jump online and play friends with  .
pretty much everyone that has a 360 has xbox live so there is never a shortage of friends or random people to play online  .
overall a great gaming experience .
i'm sure some will not agree with my cons but when you do not consider available games , ps3 is a much better system out of the box i figured microsoft would try to top sony and match or exceed ps3 , but the elite has a lower grade hdmi , digital optical out not built in , huge external power supply , problematic hd dvd add on , still no wifi connect .
the xbox 360 is a fantastic system , but i think microsoft may have jumped the gun on this one  .
why not wait until this fall to release the elite when they can include the 65 nm chip  .
smaller power brick , cooler running system , theoretically more reliable  .
add in built in wifi , and then you will truly have an elite system  .
this seems slightly better than the current $399 premium system , but this is not necessarily worthy of an upgrade for most people  .
i understand that microsoft is marketing this system for new buyers instead of existing owners , but this upgrade seems more like a partial upgrade  .
most buyers should probably wait for the ultimate xbox 360 which will be released for holiday '07 with the above mentioned changes .
i keep hearing how the elite is only $80 more  .
well here in korea you can pick up the xbox 360 for $300 usd  .
with the elite starting at $479 i really do not think a bigger hdd and hdmi is worth it  .
but i still have to say that the xbox 360 is the best game console out there .
let's face it       the 360 is notorious for having hardware problems , and while i'm sure microsoft has made some improvements in the elite design , i wouldn't bet the farm that they've got it perfect this time  .
and if you do happen to have hardware problems , you might just get bit by an unpublicized feature of the regular (non    core) console that i expect will also affect the elite what nobody tells you is that when you buy the 360 that comes with the hdd , your hdd is somehow mapped to your console  .
my first 360 froze on me and i ended up returning it , which is when microsoft told me that there is no way for me to use my old hdd with a new console  .
had i bought a core system and an aftermarket hdd this wouldn't have been a problem , but since i sprung for the more expensive model i lost all of my game saves which cost me hours of time  .
nice , huh  .
since there's little price differential between getting the core system + the big hdd , the only thing i really see going for the elite console is hdmi  .
furthermore , i'm not even sure if accessories like the hd    dvd drive and wireless are available in black (might be , but i have not seen them) , so i have to question how cool the new color really is after all overall take   if you need hdmi , consider the elite  .
otherwise , getting the core system and the big hdd may , ironically , be a better overall investment cheers  .
speleo .
wow i have read so many reviews and all they are are people being dumb about which system is better  .
i currently own a ps3 and it's cool and all , but the only reason i bought it is because of the games to come in the future  .
all my friends own 360's and thats fine i don't have any problem with 360 , but if you are going to argue about which system is better please do some research before you post idiotic comments like you are doing  .
for one ps3 does have a ethernet port in the back , so if you did want to use a chord for connecting to the internet  .
second of all most ps3 games support full 1080p i currently own 4 and 3 of them go to full 1080p  .
unfortunately i own a t  .
which only goes to 720p which i have no problem with  .
last who cares if xbox has a 120 gb hd  .
ps3's hd is a standard 2  .
5 laptop drive meaning you can go to the store and buy a 160 gb laptop drive for as much as the 120 gb hd for the 360 which is $99  .
99 , and put it right in the bottom of the ps3 with ease  .
don't get me wrong ms is a good company , but they really did not think hard enough about the elite  .
the one thing they needed to get rid of is the power brick which is ridiculously large and they needed to add wifi  .
if ms would have done these two things the elite would be worth every penny to upgrade .
i reckon its a good idea , especially the bigger hard drive , but i wont be rushing out to buy one for one reason    no games yet that i know of support 1080p , so it'll look pretty much the same on a tv .
well its good because of its memo and its also good for its form of colour which makes it more appealing to buyers of course i could afford to buy the elite but its expensive theres no point mabey ill buy it soon .
i want to be able to use natal when available , but i will not relinquish integrated wifi and bluray .
i only have four games  .
ace combat 5 , halo 3 , call of duty 4 , and guitar hero 2  .
all four of them are awesome  .
the graphics are beautiful , especially in hd  .
playing online is easy and a blast  .
the online content is great too  .
you can rent movies , in hd if you want  .
you can demo tons of games for free here's the problem  .
i don't play much  .
i got it in november , played for a month online pretty regularly , and then maybe played once or twice for a couple hours during the week  .
a few weeks ago it started locking up about 30 seconds into a game  .
i thought it is overheating , and put a fan behind the system to cool it  .
after a couple restarts , and freezing happening faster and faster , it died  .
red ring of death  .
how can a console that is 6 months old , and has limited use die so quickly  .
a trouble ticket has been submitted to microsoft , and i'm waiting on my box to come so i can ship it to them for repair i did not think hardware would be a problem based on my old xbox  .
i've had an original xbox for 4 or 5 years now  .
it has been softmodded and has about 75 games on an added 200 gig hard drive  .
in college i would leave it turned on for days at a time  .
it got hours of play every day  .
and it's still running perfect to this day  .
i guess the 360 is just built with cheap material to beat the playstation on price .
i proudly purchased an xbox the day it launched  .
i had so much fun playing halo and is so impressed with the graphics of the xbox 360 that i bought one even though i swore i would save up for a ps3 first off , let me say that i loved gears of war online  .
it goes down as the best online co    op experience i have ever had  .
no doubt about that  .
for that , i give the xbox 360 serious props now my issues  .
first off , the hardware is terrible  .
how many people have had to suffer at the hands of the dreaded 3 red lights  .
i have twice  .
i lost 2 months of my xbox live gold subscription that i paid for due to repairs  .
thankfully microsoft didn't charge me a penny for the repairs , but as you can imagine , i is pretty ticked off i bought an xbox 360 about a month after it came out  .
i is so happy when i got it and played fight night until my hands were sore  .
i is dazzled by the hd graphics  .
my ps2 , god bless it , just couldn't compete obviously , if microsoft thought that hdmi and a larger (13  .
2 gb after format ) hard drive were important , they probably should've added that in the first place  .
what i am so angry about is that not only is my premium system no longer premium , but it would cost me $179 + tax to upgrade my hdd  .
and i still don't have hdmi  .
that is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard  .
i spent $400+ on my console at launch for a faulty system and now i have to put another $200 down to get it somewhat close to the new elite  .
the white xbox looks like crap compared to the new one  .
i feel so jipped  .
is that how a loyal customer should feel  .
i is so excited to play mass effect and bioshock and halo 3 , but now i'm not nearly as excited anymore  .
why  .
because i have some second rate , reject xbox 360 that i swear is going to break down at any minute  .
rather than deal with my ticking time bomb , i is fortunate enough to find a friend who really wanted a 360  .
i is able to sell it to him for about $400  .
i took the loss on the controller and games now i have more money to spend on ps3 games this fall/winter don't get me wrong , i'm not trying to hate on the xbox 360  .
i'm hating on microsoft  .
they've got a pretty good package  .
the xbox 360 is a pretty good deal overall  .
it's got some really sweet games and xbox live is fantastic but wake up people  .
the hardware blows that's not an opinion , it's a known fact  .
the hardware is inferior to the ps3  .
i would never spend $200 for an external hd    dvd player  .
yeah you can get 1080p with it , but you get 1080p analog , not 1080p like you would with hdmi did anyone think of that  .
i'm just pissed off at microsoft for scamming me the xbox 360 elite looks great on paper , but it sure does suck when you're sitting on the phone talking to max the retarded , automated help dude that answers every xbox support call i do not want to talk to max , i effing want to talk to bill ; to give him a piece of my mind for scamming me .
i'm going back and forth as to the need for elite or premium xbox 360  .
is it beneficial to get the elite even without hd tv  .
i'm changing over from gamecube .
when you plan to charge more for a console , you better fix some of the big problem that plagued the old xbox but unfortunately , none of them are fixed the much talked about 65nm processor is not included , the benq disc that is quieter and won't kill your disc is not included  .
and most importantly , the same manuafacturing problem that killed a lot of xbox is still there but hey , look at the bright side , it's black now , so i guess it justify the price increase look microsoft , just because apple charges more for black model , it doesn't mean you have to follow too , but unlike apple , apple do not charge more for a newer , better model after 1 and half years since release (look at my 5  .
5g ipod) .
the new elite has got people talking , but now the premium xbox360 owners such as myself , are feeling bad that we own one  .
i mean why didn't ms do this from the start  .
i really do not recommend this to anyone , just buy an external hdd , they are cheaper than buying the system itself  .
it is overall pretty good , but it really should not be released after almost 2 years .
the good stuff    .
i am quite pleased with the quality of the graphics of the games that i played on the xbox 360 i also enjoy the xbox menu system that microsoft has decided to use  .
it has provided me to easy access to features of the console that i often use the bad stuff    .
i is not pleased when i needed to buy an expensive xbox exclusive wi    fi adaptor to access their paid only service  .
i expect that by this time , the console should have included such a basic accessory there is also no blu    ray player unlike microsoft's close competitor the ps3  .
i do not understand the reason behind not including this feature as well the xbox online service provides several features that are quite useful to several users but i am disappointed that there is no paid service option available unlike the ps3 i have bought an extra remote and an external wi    fi adaptor to connect to the paid online xbox service  .
in total this costed me over half the price of the console itself which i find to be ridiculous it is even more ridiculous when my xbox remote decided to become faulty due to the battery cover  .
i called up the xbox hotline service and it took me fifteen minutes to explain the fault in my remote  .
after their careful listen to my explanation , their response is to buy another one as it is already outside the warranty period  .
i wonder why they did not tell me this before wasting my time explaining the issue in the first place overall , i will not recommend this product as there is a later model out i will recommend the later 'slim edition' model to people who enjoy xbox's online service and exclusive games  .
otherwise , i recommend another console such as the ps3 which i believe provides better value for your money .
the ps3 offers much more in the 299$ price than the xbox 360 .
microsoft really has to step it up  .
playstation has a built in blu    ray player , which really gives it an advantage  .
if you want to play online , pay 100 bucks for the wireless adapter and 50 dollars for live  .
that 150$  .
which the ps3 , this is all free  .
the xbox just cannot compete .
i've always been a diehard ps2/3 fan , but i could not resist some of the x    box only games like gears of war  .
so i picked this up used on ebay to add to my ps3  .
the sad part is , it was not worth it  .
halo 3 is not that great , and the same with mass effect the only really great thing i found about this system is the live service the way it tracks your friends achievements is pretty cool .
i only have the elite for about six months and i dont even play it every day , i am always very careful with it and already the tray opens and does not stay closed , now it will take a month to get it back from microsoft , very dissapointed considering all the games i bought and the money i spend the must make this console very cheap  .
i have already been through 2 360's due to the 3 flashing red lights  .
did microsoft fix the problem in the elite  .
if not then i'm gonna just take my chances with the pro again .
i have an xbox 360 / 20gb  .
i really do not see that this new model adds anything of real value i would not suggest using an xbox to download / store hd quality movies  .
that's really the only reason to have the 120gb drive and frankly , that is not big enough  .
itunes is the better way to go for a multiplatform media storage system that aside though , i'm getting the impression that microsoft is going to wind up strangling the xbox 360 with its profiteering  .
the ps3 and the wii both allow somewhat open access to the web  .
the ps3 in particular , comes as a bd player with web access    a true media up for an entertainment system to approach the abilities of a ps3 on an xbox 360 , you have to buy an external hd    dvd player for $200 on an already expensive $480 xbox 360 , for a total cost of $680  .
then you need to add a $50    $100 adapter for wireless  .
for that cost , you get a product that has more games but is technically inferior to the ps3 and is not as well integrated (ie , extra cables and boxes)  .
the ps3 enjoys compatibility with the older ps2 games as well , while old game compatibility is a crap shoot with xbox360 (and when they do work    they download stuff to you hard drive) xbox 360's main advantage right now is its low price of entry ($350    $400) and its game library  .
against that is poor integration , inferior technology compared to ps3 , and closed software design that locks you into ms only content .
if microsoft wants to sell new consoles give us something to buy if they make a quieter 360 with whatever amount of storage , and hdmi 1  .
3 interface , built    in wifi , more usb plugs , above average dvd upconversion , and a built    in hd    dvd drive they will have a winner on their hands until that happens , i'm gonna wait or maybe buy a ps3 (i'm pretty sure it had all of those things )  .
