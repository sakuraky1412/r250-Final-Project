i had some problems with my hotel booking before arriving in moscow but there was excellent communication from staff , who worked hard to ensure that arrangements were to my satisfaction .
this hotel is close to the beautiful mayakovskaya metro station which is on line 2 , leading from the dme airport express station .
turn left at the kfc and it’s less than 5 minutes on the next corner .
( if you carry on walking , you would reach red square in less than 30 minutes .
) i was greeted courteously and was personally welcomed by the hotel manager - i’m a platinum elite member .
the lobby of the hotel is suitably grand , the room less so , it was comfortable and had all that i needed , including tea and coffee-making facilities and bathrobes and slippers , but it had a slightly worn and jaded feeling to it , as did the hotel corridor .
i loved the service in the cosy executive lounge , the staff there were incredibly kind and solicitous and both the evening meal and breakfast were simple and more than satisfying .
i also love the fact that the small swimming pool and fitness centre is open 24 hours a day .
the hotel’s lobby bar staff were friendly and i enjoyed my simple lunch there .
i would definitely stay at this grand hotel again .
the warmth of the english-speaking staff was a great start to my first but , hopefully , not my last trip to this beautiful . . .
