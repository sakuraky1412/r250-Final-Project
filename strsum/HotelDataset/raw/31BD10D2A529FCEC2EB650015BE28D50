this hotel is located in the village of barajas , a few kms from the airport .
they have a regular shuttle service from all terminals that picks you up from the hotel shuttle areas outside the terminal buildings ( call when you get your luggage ) .
the shuttle leaves hourly from the hotel to take you back to the airport , starting from 4am and takes around 10 minutes .
they have a small restaurant and nearby you can find plenty of little bars as well as the metro line into the city center .
it is a modern hotel , efficiently run and very clean .
looks a little more luxurious online than in reality , but all in all very good .
i must comment on the lovely lady at breakfast , i arrived late however she prepared me a couple of eggs and could n't do enough to help - breakfast is only 6 euros and includes hot and cold buffet , freshly squeezed orange juice etc , so a bargain at this price .
i would have given a 4 , as the hotel runs a tight ship however the beds really are very hard .
i have never complained about a bed before as i am really not fussy but in this hotel , it was as hard as a rock .
another tiny point , on the web the photos show bathroom toiletries however in reality the soap is from a dispenser and the bathroom only includes minimal toiletries .
sure , there is a note . . .
