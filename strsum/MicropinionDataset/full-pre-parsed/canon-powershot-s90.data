this is great product  .

i bought this camera based upon david pogue's review online  .

if you are considering buying this camera , i suggest you read his review too  .

i wanted a camera that would take excellent pictures indoors without flash  .

this camera does that very well       much better than my last camera , which i thought is good  .

i wanted a camera with a wide    angle lens to capture everything indoors  .

this camera does that very well  .

i is relatively unconcerned about full manual control of aperture , shutter speed , etc  .

but i have discovered that the user interface on this camera makes it so easy to dial in the settings i want that i am now using manual control for all my pictures , getting the best pictures ever , and loving every minute of it  .

although the camera is slightly thicker around the lens than my last camera , i can still easily put this camera in my pants pocket i have had to use every camera i have owned for a while to get so familiar with the controls that i do not have to think about them  .

that is true for this camera too  .

but the wonderful thing is that the more i use the camera , the more i discover about the features it offers and how easy it is to use them  .

for example , i recently learned that i can choose an alternate set of display characteristics that are accessible with the push of a button  .

i have chosen to have the screen divided into thirds horizontally and vertically , making it easier to attractively compose pictures  .

and i can turn this on or off with the push of a button  .

some things that initially seemed awkward now seem to work very well one great thing about this camera that i have not seen in other reviews is that it remembers the way i want it to work  .

for example , i choose to have the flash turned off all the time as my normal way of operating  .

this camera remembers that  .

my last camera required me to manually turn off the flash every time i turned on the camera , which is annoying , and i occasionally forgot to do this , with irritating consequences  .

it's wonderful to have this camera ready to go the way i want it to go as soon as i turn it on one peculiar thing is that when the camera is set to automatically control the exposure , it seems that my efforts to increase or decrease the exposure by a couple of f stops do not have as great an effect as i would expect       as if the camera is trying to keep me out of trouble  .

in some cases , this is frustrating , but i am now using full manual choice of the settings , so it is no problem another peculiar thing is that sometimes the image on the screen is darker when i shoot the picture than when i view the picture after it has been shot  .

i am learning to compensate for this , and it is not a serious problem , but i think canon could improve this a bit in general , this camera takes wonderful pictures easily and automatically , and it is also very easy to manually control       it just takes some time and practice to get familiar with it  .

the more i use it , the better i like it  .

people who look at the pictures i take are usually blown away by them  .

and so am i .

i am currently own a nikon dslr and have had when it is time to buy a new p s i first went to nikon  .

finding nothing that i liked , i decided upon the s90 and couldn't be happier  .

i do a great deal of hdr work , and let me tell you , this can get you some astonishing results  .

the colors are extremely accurate and the autobracketing feature works like a charm my favorite part is definitely the f2 lens  .

i can get outstanding low light shots without having to sacrifice and move to a higher iso  .

speaking of iso , this is th most noise free i have ever seen a p s  .

pictures are usuable in large print all the way up to iso 800 , and the fact that it can expand to 3200 is great for very low light , however you will see a decent amount of noise i could not be any happier with my choice  .

if you are looking for a simple p s to take to family functions and are not really into photography , i suggest that you save yourself a few bucks and get the sd780 or sd1200  .

but for serious photographers out there , or simply someone who wants to enhance their photography skills but not throw down big dollars for a dslr , then i highly recommend this camera  .

wow  .

how do i love thee , canon powershot s90  .

let me count the ways i've been a fan of photography for a long time (started with an all    manual pentax k1000) but i'm really just a novice so i need my camera to think for me when i cannot remember which aperture number i need for low light and i really want the shot  .

the point    n    shoot cameras i've had in the past were frustrating because either i couldn't figure out how to set them up or get them to the settings i wanted , or they were too darn slow  .

the s90 is quick on start    up and pretty good on shot    to    shot time (much better than my previous cameras , but still not slr speed       none of them can be) while i agree that the flash placement is a bit odd , i've already adjusted to it and it's really not a problem  .

good idea to order the grip for it , as well as an adjustable wrist strap , but if those are the worst things about the camera then it's a really great camera  .

the loose dial on the back of the camera that other reviews point out is not really much of an issue  .

in fact , it's kind of nice to be able to quickly scroll through the menu selections  .

again , with the special grip this really wo not be an issue for most users i have a rebel xt that i really like , and have owned several point    n    shoot cameras from other manufacturers but i wanted a good shooter to take where an slr might not comfortably go  .

so far i've played with all the features and it's very intuitive  .

it has all the auto features you might want for those friends/family/pet shots , but lots of creative options to play with when you're in the mood for it  .

very comfortable , but sturdy  .

the low light setting is amazing  .

this camera is really intuitive for the novice user , but advanced enough to satisfy the photography student or advanced amateur looking for ways to practice their craft without the cumbersome bulk of an slr  .

in fact , it is a professional photographer who recommended it to me as the only camera to buy  .

i'm already in love with this little machine and cannot wait to get back to playing with it  .

happy shooting  .

if the only thing stopping you from buying a  .

dslr or semi    advance camera is that it is not pocket size , the s90 is the best option by far  .

also for curious beginners this camera is a good introduction to more advance features that pays off with much better pics .

check out the canon powershot s90 group on flickr , for examples of great looking photos  .

i like to have a camera close at all times and be able to get high quality pictures  .

this camera is just right for me .

i have been waiting for a camera like this for a long time  .

i am a semi    pro photographer  .

i am , and have always been a nikon guy for my slrs  .

however , canon has always been my camera of choice for point    and    shoot cameras i like the image quality and functional design of the canon point    and    shoot cameras better  .

the challenge that i had is that the ever increasing mp insanity started to reduce the quality of the images even on the canons when i first read the promo information about this camera i couldn't believe that a camera company had finally stopped the insanity  .

the reduction of the mp and the slight image sensor size increase have really paid off i just bought the camera yesterday and i have taken 200+ pictures  .

as previously indicated , the user interface is amazing  .

there are 2 control rings available at all times  .

one is small    placed under the right thumb  .

the other is around the lense  .

both have excellent ergonomic feel    just the right amount of resistance then a positive soft lock in the position where you want it to stay  .

the screen is excellent  .

i don't know how many pixels it is , but it is vibrant , large and clear everything is easy to set on the camera  .

doing non    studio portraits and events , i am used to checking iso , wb , f    stop , and shutter before every set of shots  .

each one of these is at my fingertips on the s90 the image quality is amazing  .

even at high isos the pictures are amazing  .

i have never had a point    and    shoot that had usable images above 400 iso  .

this camera can produce usable 4x6 in prints at 1600 iso  .

they are not perfect , but i is essentially shooting in the dark  .

this is also a function of the f2 lense i really cannot say enough about the intelligent design of this camera my only reservations are regarding   the grip , as mentioned above ; no optical viewfinder , which i like to use in very bright situations , and the choice of battery    this is the first point and shoot that i have had in a very long time that didn't take aa batteries  .

i like aa batteries because they serve the way i use a point and shoot camera  .

they are available in every city and country , they don't require any pre    planning for charging , and the lithium ones are light and let me shoot almost endlessly  .

i guess i will have to deal with toting around the charger    which is admittedly very small this is the camera that every photo    enthusiast should have in the pocket or briefcase (like mine) at all times  .

if you do not set all of your controls before you take a picture buy one of the basic a    series canons    you will save money and be just as happy .

well worth the cost  .

if you pick this up you will not have to buy another cam for many years to come .

this camera has reproducible , excellent image quality in a compact form factor  .

i cannot imagine a better camera at this size , nor one that has controls so readily at hand  .

it feels sturdy  .

the dials are extremely useful and make the camera easily configurable and fun  .

with a little practice it is easy to get excellent photos  .

this is a great pocket    sized alternative to the g11 with most of the same features and picture quality .

this camera packs a punch for its size  .

raw image capability is a big plus for the serious amateur or backup camera for the freelancer sharp pictures even in low light great on the fly controls with the front ring (i assigned focal length) and the shortcut button (iset for iso)  .

at about $500 this camera does not suit everyone's budget  .

its far superior to the competition that falls in the $325    $450 price range  .

cut out a few dinners out and put the extra $100 to $150 into this camera that will give you years of pleasure  .

i give canon high marks for this camera .

for me it's all about the picture quality , that is the colors from people to landscapes  .

and the s90 delivers  .

the jpegs are great straigh out from the box and that is great because who has the time to process every raw shot  .

let the camera do the processing as much as possible  .

i could have bought a panasoic but the colors have always stopped me from buying one  .

i find the skin colors to be cold and a little pinkish  .

i prefer canon colors , they pop and are nicely saturated this camera is fun to use , you do not think twice about carrying it with you and you know you will get top    notch pictures  .

there is one picture that i took that is looks almost 3 dimentional in depth  .

that is how good this camera is .

excellent picture quality for p s camera with exceptional low light images without flash  .

unfortunately , the flash and rear dial placement detract from this otherwise great camera  .

flash placement is annoying but not should not cause serious problems  .

however , the placement of the rear dial which is easily rotated can be a disaster depending on the shooting mode  .

in those instances when the dial controls iso , it can be accidentally moved to settings which wash    out your images  .

most novice users should shoot in auto mode that provides excellent results in most instances .

i have used this camera for 3 weeks now and there are both pros and cons that i think you should read if you're considering buying this camera  .

i've found cons that no one has stated or listed as yet which i hope helps in your buying decision  .

i've examined this camera very closely and feel a rating of 3  .

5 stars is very fair if price is not an issue then a 4 rating is justified  .

but considering the price point with no hd and poor plastic construction on top/bottom of camera i feel this is fair  .

the front and back of the back are metal nice f/2 lens which lets in twice as much light as a 2  .

8 lens , this also helps in taking great low light pictures a great 10mp resolution balance with a big sensor to reduce noise and grain in the pictures  .

aeb function for exposure bracketing and hdr (this feature not listed on box or canon's site even though it has aeb) flash compensation control to help with avoiding the wash out effect of a strong flash close to the subject custom setting which allows to change the sharpness and saturation of the default picture settings as mention the ring dials in front and back of camera for easier manual control and setting micro focus for excellent bokeh control to close up subjects the f/2 is only at the widest setting lcd screen pure color ii is of poor quality when re    viewing or taking dark images due to washed out pixels very disappointing as this problem exists on almost all of the s90's i've examined which is about 5    6 cameras  .

never had this problem with previous sd canon's but there is a definite problem with quality control on this issue the top/bottom of the camera is made from plastic , unfortunately when you place your finger on the top of the camera the plastic (squeaks and clicks) when pressure is applied for holding the camera really disappointing  .

again this probelm exists on 5    6 cameras that i tried , another quality issue canon needs to address the battery life is sub par you will definitely need 2    3 batteries to take you through the day ring dial on the back of the camera is way too loose , as even your shirt sleeve can change the settings accidentally if you're not careful , as well too much spinning is required to changed the setting where you sometimes have to spin the dial around over 3    4 to reach your settings no hd video which is a shame with such a nice f/2 lens especially for the price point a very annoying issue is the pop up flash that is perfectly placed where you place your left finger on top of the camera you will need patience to learn to hold this camera correctly without blocking the flash severe barrel distortion at widest setting when shooting raw , you will need to use canon's software to straighten , jpegs are fine the strap that comes with the s90 does not have a wrist lock as it does with the sd line so that the camera doesn't slip off your wrist when dangling  .

the camera is a bit on the heavy side so you should get a strap with a wrist lock as the strap it comes in is long and loose and will definitely fall off your wrist and i have big hands and is surprised when it almost slipped off a few times so i bought a strap with the wrist lock and its worth it  .

the last thing you want is to drop this camera because it will not last one fall with the top and bottom made from flimsy plastic i would have liked to have seen a 24mm or 26mm wide angle lens at this price point since there is no hd but what can you do hope this info helps because you will have the same issues as me with the pros and the cons  .

it is probably the best ps camera out there for now until the panasonic lx4 comes out next year but who knows how much better that will be and how much it will cost and what availability will be like  .

if you can get the s90 for a better price and hope you get one that does not have washed out dark pixels then you would have a really good buy and should be satisfied with your purchase cheers .

if they put a grip on the camera and upped the zoom factor , this would be an amazing p s camera  .

its ability to take pics in low light is probably the best there is today in a camera of this size and price  .

if canon fixes these two issues , it would then be , in my opinion , a 5 star camera .

i think the design is sloppy  .

it provides dslr type control , a big sensor and a nice lens , but canon must have thought that is enough  .

at this price point it should be more than an average performer , the zoom should be smoother and quicker as i find that i miss a number of shots because of the sluggish zoon , and it seems that i am among many users who find the flash placement and the ring on the back a constant irritation .

i bought this camera so i could have more control in a small package  .

many camera manufacturers make their small camera automatic , but cannon has attempted to give the shooter some dslr control in a small camera  .

it has only partly succeeded  .

for example , good low light shooting with f2  .

0 , but the f2  .

0 is only available at the lowest zoom level  .

i like the unique and usable front ring dial  .

i shoot mainly in aperture    mode , so the front ring is to change the aperture  .

using the ring is fast and accurate  .

but the ring dial on the back of the camera is way too loose    results in inadvertent exposure change  .

after shooting a couple of hundred shoots , i is becoming conditioned to constantly check the exposure compensation  .

i found many time , that my fingers had accidentlly changed the exposure compensatoin  .

this is very bad  .

another weakness on this camera is the low zoom  .

as always compromises have ot be made in a camera this small , but i constantly found myself zooming past the optical zoom into digital zoom  .

i carry this camera constantly , so i like its small size but the design is a bit off    putting  .

with sucha small form factor , my ahnds are constantly struggling to get comfortable , with such a lovely screen on the back , battery life really suffers  .

i is walking around for about fours hours and is already getting a battery warning  .

albeit it during this time i is looking at the screen a lot , admiring both the pictures and learning all the controls so in i would like a bigger zoom with an even faster lens in a small package , where the battery lasts longer  .

keep the front ring and redesign the back ring to be tighter  .

or redesign the camera to guide fingers away from inadvertently touching of the ring  .

also , decrease the ridiculous price  .

i do not ask for much , do i  .

finally , i am not sure if i am keeping the camera  .

perhaps i will return and wait for the next gen , where hopefully cannon will keep the good features and improve the not so good .

performance wise is the best among the pocket camera and i am satisfy on the photo quality  .

i bought this camera 2 months ago , and it works well at the beginning of my travel at sydney , but bad things happen is it suddenly not working when i am take out my canon s90 to take some beautiful scenery shots  .

i hope canon can enhance the quality assurance in order camera wo not going off when try to take a great scenery photo , this is really upset and disappointed when this case happen on the consumer .

seems to be a little on the fragile side , if after 6 hours of ownership , the flash is already broken .

the s90 has some major flaws despite canon  .

s attempt to provide a great product  .

the single most disturbing flaw is the lack of  .

super fine  .

compression ratio  .

canon  .

s japanese engineers have eliminated this on their entire new fleet line regardless of any settings users change , images come out flat , blurry in same cases , noisy/grainy and the colors are faded at best why has canon eliminated the  .

super fine  .

jpeg compression ratio  .

ve tested the sd980 is and the s90 (and several others for that matter) ; none of their new cameras offer anything remotely as nice as my aging sd800 is  .

the sd800 is still produces the best pictures i  .

ve seen for a quick shot digital cam ; images are always sharp and crisp , colors are vibrant , and with just a little manipulation i am ready to print do your research before buying a canon  .

email them and request their engineers bring back the  .

super fine  .

jpeg compression ratio (i tried to rate this with only 1 star , but cnet is sure to force users to give at least 1  .

5 stars  .
