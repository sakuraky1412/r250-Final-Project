you can not open a window due to this noise and all the people who are smoking in front of your room , after 2 minutes the room smelled like a bar , how disgusting is this !
avoid this overrated hotel , it is nothing more than 2* or it is of a hostel quality , there is no service , poor rooms , location is scary with all the drunks and addicts right in front of your hotel and street ( these were no refugees , but homeless hungarians ) did not feel safe at all at night while walking there .
room was very hot and stuffy , they refused to turn back on the ac- 4* hotel , paid 110â‚¬ per night !
next day got another room 410 , no street noise , but half the size of the other room , no chair , no table , the bathroom door and shower door could not be opened together , that small of a bathroom , no bath , ventilation system did not work in both of the rooms .
in the end the manager stopped by , he was so arrogant and extremely impolite , he would be the person who decides when the ac would be turned on/or off and refused to see room 410 .
no english channels on the tv , wifi was not good enough to skype , no ac , could also not open the window because 410 faces a courtyard where people are smoking all the time !
too small and the linnen squakes if you turn , such bad quality !
rooms at the front side face a lot of noise , directly on the street with a lot of drunks , addicts and traffic .
the room was so small we could not even pass each other !
the walls were covered with big stains , so were the curtains and carpet .
