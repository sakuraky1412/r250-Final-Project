this is superb place to stay and get a wonderful safari experience within a 3 hour drive from johannesburg .
for the game , drive and walk i would give it 11 out of 10 - we had lizzy for all our game drives ( bar one ) and she was superb - absolutely knew her stuff and was passionate about giving her guests the best experience possible and was happy to share so much information about the animals and what we were seeing .
only the leopard eluded us this visit - but we saw all the rest and more besides .
gerry , the head ranger , ( & zak ) took us on a walking safari - it has to be one of the most amazing experiences i have ever had .
i had not expected to get so much out of walking through the park but it was incredible - we even saw a baby white rhino !
so special .
accommodation was good with bath , bedroom and balcony overlooking the watering hole for the animals .
food was great - buffet style and the braai night is worth doing .
special mention to may and sylvia in the spa - they had magic hands and the treatments were some of the best i 've had anywhere .
all the staff gave exception service in the bar , by the pool or just wandering around .
a little updating in places ( like the spa area ) , perhaps a few less big groups and some attention to . . .

a little updating in places ( like the spa area ) , perhaps a few less big groups and some attention to detail when it comes to the final bill - which took some sorting out would really make this place top notch.
