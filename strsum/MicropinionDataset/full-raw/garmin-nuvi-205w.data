205w for my company has worked fine in each and every case we have used it simple never any problems at all with all the ones we have owned none .
i like the voiice instructions and the easy info entry there is nothing i don't like about it  .
oh wait a minute , it seeems that the battery charge does not last all that long .
this is my first gps and so far i love it  .
after reading some of the past reviews with the battery life , i have not experienced any battery problems  .
i made sure to fully charge it right out of the box  .
loving the ability to download different navigation voices  .
so far cartman is my favorite  .
all in all the product is well worth it price i payed for it  .
on sale for $99 at best buy .
i do not understand why everyone is so worried about text to speech on the devices  .
it always sounds odd  .
if you cannot under stand turn left with the street clearly displayed at the top of the gps , then you probably should not be the one driving this device is very slick and feels like a much more expensive gps  .
i've done side by side comparisons with a slightly more expensive tom tom , and this does all the same functions just as good , but looks better doing it  .
the tom tom's display seems more clunky and utilitarian , whereas this seems much more refined and clean as a basic gps and travel partner , this works great  .
i love being able to find a thai restaurant close to my location and it gives the phone # so i can call in my order before i arrive garmin supports their product very good with firmware and software updates on a regular basis to improve features and functions they also have 60 days of free map updates after purchase in the event they release any new updates i received my gps on christmas and just got my map update in february  .
they also off some fun extras for customizing you gps  .
(free voices and free vehicle avatars)  .
if you are looking for a great inexpensive basic gps , buy this one .
got this at office depot for $150  .
came with windshield mount and i bought a friction beanbag mount for it  .
went on an unplanned trip to moline/rock island/davenport ia area never been there before and it would have been a nightmare without this garmin  .
it never missed a beat directing me to wherever i needed to go  .
only one time is it inaccurate about a pizza place , but it put me within site of it  .
got me to walmart to hop by using the points of interests feature  .
the where am i feature that directs you to hospitals , gas stations , ect  .
is great  .
get one and get peace of mind for road travel  .
all in all , i no longer need a map for anything and rely and trust fully in g , my nuvi has never been wrong about anything , including pinpointing within 1 to 1 1/2 minutes of when i will arrive at my destination no matter how long or short the trip very proud that i have found a product that did not dissapoint me in any way  .
updated  .
on sep 3 , 2009  .
we bought this gps so my parents , who came over to visit , can drive around and explore california's pois  .
it is easy for them to use and accurate as well  .
for the price , you cannot beat its features  .
happy with the purchase .
this is very easy to use and pretty accurate and for the price you really cant beat it  .
great for getting from point a to point b and anything else inbetween  .
pois could be better but still very good overall and very reliable .
this gps system price for price and turn for turn is the best .
i think garmin has been doing this gps thing a long time and it shows  .
would highly recommend this unit to beginners or to those strapped for cash .
all except one of the demented routes have involved country dirt roads that the unit thinks are usable but aren't  .
once from reagan national trying to get to northern maryland , the unit decided i needed to go through the surface streets of georgetown  .
what a mess  .
it didn't get me lost but just how it decided that is beyond me overall i like the unit , it has accurately and successfully steered me to hundreds of destinations  .
garmin pis es me off charging almost the cost of a new unit for map updates there are the times though when it will badly screw up on the routing and i could imaging that there could be times when that could be a real problem  .
i really do not have experience with other brands to know whether they occasionally screw up too .
oh you'll love this unit , its a straight shooter with extras  .
it does better than getting it done  .
i still like the product even though there are certain features that should be on there , but what the price is pending on where you go to purchase the item , is good one  .
if you are looking for a product that is user friendly and actually works , this is it .
if you can buy this under 150 , its a steal  .
very good basic functions  .
it is a no frill gps system that has gotten me from pt a to b easily .
if you can get this model for under $200 , then the basic features and mistake    proof functionality makes this model a bargain  .
my first driving experience had me listening to the voice prompts more than the satellite radio .
it's very easy to use  .
when we were on our way through ga to tn , it tried to tell us to get off i    75 make a bunch of turns and then get back on i    75  .
what would be the point in that  .
it also told us that the mall we were trying to find is on the left and it is actually on the right  .
by the time you realize you're in the wrong lane it's too late to get over and you have no choice but to make a u    turn somewhere  .
overall this is a nice gps system .
we are going to upgrade to probably a 265w because it sometimes announces the turn too soon and there is another street before the correct one and we turn on the wrong street  .
of course , we could look at the screen and see the street name , but that is not the best thing to do in heavy traffic  .
we also want to have the feature of real time traffic which the 265w has free for lifetime  .
we're not sure if the bluetooth feature is worth it or not  .
there are so many models of garmins to chose from it is really confusing          and so many features  .
the pros of this 205w is the larger screen is easy to see and its nice to see the little car moving along  .
the voice is clear  .
it is easy to program and seems to sense what street name we are typing in quickly  .
the cons we already listed  .
we are going to keep the 205w for at home use and the 265w will be used to travelling/business  .
garmin has good tech support via email but their phone support is poor since always a long wait time .
i originaly loved this gps but the battery problems i have been facing which seems to be a common problem with this model has changed my mind .
some garmins have very high ratings but the nuvi 205w needs a lot of work before i can recommend it to someone  .
back to bestbuy we gooooo  .
this is my first gps and it is also the cheapest at the time  .
with the few times this garmin has gotten me lost i just cannot tell a friend it's any good  .
i'll be looking to tom tom next .
based on my use of the garmin for about a year , i have to say my older tomtom is more user friendly  .
however the garmin seems to be better on knowing more roads  .
not just newer roads , but really old roads also  .
the battery has never held a longer charge than 2 hours and now is only about 30 mins  .
i'm dissappointed with the garmin overall , but not totally  .
i will more than lilkey purchase another tomtom  .
i checked to see if my battery is affected with the recent recall , but it says its not after checking the serial number  .
i is hoping that is the cause of the poor battery performance .
it will not charge in the car while it is operating  .
we have to print directions from one of the driving direction sites as a backup for every trip  .
i am not a tomtom dealer          just a very disappointed consumer .
my wife got me a gps for a wedding present last august  .
this thing has a few nice features   points of interest etc  .
i think i would have much preferred a qwerty touchscreen keyboard to a    z , if a street you're inputting has more than one number in it , good luck (e  .
streets here in utah have a 100 north 200 east system) it doesn't work well for inputting it while owning this gps , we saved some points (like directions to friends' houses) etc , then one day it decided to not boot up  .
so i had to clear the user info  .
that fixed the problem , but we lost all the directions to friends' homes  .
then this past weekend when driving to my parents' home in colorado the stupid thing wouldn't boot up  .
it would say loading maps , then a progress bar would make it 95+% done , then it would shut off  .
rebooting didn't fix the issue  .
i wo not buy a garmin again  .
also you cannot buy cool voice packs with this like you can for other models .
when starting you have to press agree in order to make it work  .
every time  .
colors of road are so similar to the route color that it got confusing  .
hard to tell when to get off an exit  .
gave us the wrong route many times  .
the road on the map is tiny while the car (representing you) is huge , you couldn't tell if you were on a 1 lane road or 5  .
all road sizes seemed exactly the same  .
slow to refresh so it seems more like stills than an animated route  .
sometimes it took 5 minutes to acquire the sats , even on a cloudless sunny day  .
speaker , while loud , is slightly distorted  .
power cord is in an annoying location , making it hang right over your steering column  .
the way the maps are drawn you could not tell if the exit is coming up , or a mile away  .
at one point i located where i is at the time and set it as a favorite (so i could find my way back later)  .
later on when i tried to navigate back , it put the location i had saved in another state  .
i knew something is wrong when it told me it would take me 2 hours to arrive  .
i wanted to find union station in d  .
and it seemed impossible  .
never asked me what state i wanted so , unless i knew the street name and address , i could just forget it  .
i had just gotten it and is using it with a friend (who is driving) and he is so annoyed , he kept asking me , why did you get this  .
by the time the trip is over , i asked the same question .
fyi , i bought a garmin nuvi 250w about 6 mos  .
ago ; this is my second garmin  .
i have been quite disappointed with it    for one , the car charger will not charge this unit sufficiently to keep it going while it's turned on , while traveling  .
remarkable , i know , for a car gps , but , according to the garmin rep  .
that i complained to over the phone , that's how the unit works (or doesn't work)  .
why would you buy a gps that will only get you half way to your destination on an 8 hour trip  .
i wouldn't buy it again  .
as if that weren't enough , the maps also were not as accurate , for some reason , as the older model that i had , which i never updated , and it will occasionally not be able to find a location that the older unit would , or , as it happens , will tell me i have reached my destination , when i'm a  .
5 mile or more away from it  .
my next gps will not be a garmin .
i'm a yacht racer for whom garmin has always been the name in navigation  .
so i is outraged by the poor performance of the nuvi 205w  .
it took me off highways onto routes i knew to be longer , through neighborhoods , with lights and traffic       after updating the software online and changing settings as recommended by tech support , who seemed genuinely concerned about the issues  .
once i turned onto the better way to go , it took so long to recalculate , by the time it told me the next turn , i is on it  .
trying to make an exit at the last second , cutting across lanes in dc traffic , this thing is going to get me killed  .
it sent me 16 miles afield to the wrong location for the largest movie theatre in northern virginia  .
i'd be sitting in front of a building that the garmin is telling me is on the next block  .
a friend and i both could not find a bar because of the wrong location given by our garmins  .
on the way there , it put us both on a dark , windy , narrow , unlit , two    lane road instead of the six    lane , 55    mph highway a few hundred yards away , and said to turn left where there is no left turn allowed  .
the garmin routinely conflicted with googlemaps on my pda , which always seemed spot    on  .
maybe they need to get a licensing agreement with google  .
but this unit does not deliver the goods  .
mine is back in the box for a refund .
this unit is great when it worked but it did not work very often  .
it would go off completely every time i used it before i made it to my destination  .
after using it 10 times , it died and will not come back on  .
it seems this has been an ongoing problem and it is disappointing that garmin does not correct this problem or replace these defective units after 30 days  .
i will not buy another garmin .
i had this unit for about two months before it stopped working  .
when i turn it on it displays the garmin startup logo and then the screen flashes and the process starts over  .
when it does this i cannot even turn it off , i have to wait for the battery to die  .
i cannot try to reload software or firmware because my computer won't recognize it since it doesn't fully turn on  .
what a complete waste of money  .
it also does not have a reset button which would be convenient  .
it's not like i even dropped it to cause this malfunction  .
