Pros:. Beautiful Picture! Stylish. The red is just a tinge and really looks black with just a hint of red. Looks great on my wall. Menus = EASY. Lots of good preconfigs until you figure it out. Lots of ports! Great digi processing, don't need new rcvr.. 
Cons:. Placing motion stabilization on high causes movies and some standard tv broadcasts to look a little too real. Also makes some special effects too fake. Use the motion features for sports, turn it on but down low for movies and TV. Looks great.. 
Summary:. For my price point there was no better television. Bought it on Amazon. NO ISSUES! Saved about 200 bucks that way and arrived safely and carried in by careful guys. Not one issue hooking it up. Color and blacks continue to amaze. It's like my own personal movie theater in my house.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very attractive, phenomenal picture, comprehensive features.. 
Cons:. can get screen glare in some settings. 
Summary:. I have a smaller (32") Samsung TV and I expected this larger version to have a slightly worse picture (the small TV has an awesome picture) but I was pleasantly surprised. The new one is far superior in all modes. Even the PC input is terrific. I suppose there are pictures as good or better but I don't thin my eye would be able to detect it. This set was also a good by. I bought it at BestBuy as a close-out. I can't even find it anymore on their website and I have only had it 2 weeks. If you can find this set for less than $1800, buy it! I use this with a DirecTV HD HR23 STB and a Logitech Harmony One universal remote and they work flawlessly together.. 

$$;
Pros:. Samsung is known for its high quality in HDTV. Perfect in color performance and with 120Hz technology to reduce blur during fast motion movie. I recommend you to check out www.squidoo.com/best-hdtv for information on what the cheapest and best HDTV.. 
Cons:. I can't think of one.. 
Summary:. I recommend everyone to get this HDTV for its quailty and popularity.. 

$$;
Pros:. Most unbelievable picture I have seen on any tv. Blacks are black, colors are bright and accurate. Set up was easy. Red border is not noticeable. Remote is easy to learn. Menus are easy to use and intuitive. Would recommend this tv to anyone.. 
Cons:. Only very minor complaint is that I didn't realize until after I hooked everything up that you need to have a 1.3 HDMI cable to get all benefits of HDMI. I would have had one handy right out of the box. No reason to downgrade the unit in any way.. 
Summary:. Was forced to buy a new tv after my my four year-old Sony's light engine died for the second time and Sony would not cover the repair. They offered me a discount on one of their lower end models (60Hz) and wouldn't budge. Told them no thanks, I'll spend my money elsewhere. Reviewed different models extensively on cnet and elsewhere. I'm so glad I bought this Samsung. Best tv I have ever owned...period. Colors are rich and blacks are truly black. Very little adjustment needed right out of the box. Felt confident about buying this unit and I am glad I did. Was a little concerned about the remote and the "wheel". I think it is a personal preference issue more than anything else. I found it easy to use, similar to a computer mouse and therefore very comfortable for me to use. My wife finds it easier to navigate with the wheel. Red color not noticeable. Au revoir, Sony. You'll never see another dollar of mine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture, Easy Setup, Easy Menu Navigation. 
Cons:. Non HDTV is average looking. 
Summary:. This was my first HDTV so I really spent a lot of time researching. I generally read a lot of positive comments about this set and all of the comments were true. The purchase experience was great (BuyDig) and the set was working within about 3 minutes of arriving. Fortunately for me, the NCAA's were on when I plugged it in and from the first second I saw the picture I was stunned. Crystal clear picture with vibrant and true colors that are not overly intense. There are 3 predefined settings for picture but the "standard" picture setting was perfect for me. There are a number of other picture controls but quite frankly I haven't had to use any of them. The standard definition TV picture is just ok but that's not why I bought an HDTV.. Even things that people complained about in the reviews that I read don't seem that bad. Of all the negative issues, I was most worried about the glare. This has not been a problem. Our TV is in a room with a large window on the side and while the sun doesn't shine directly on the TV the room does get filled with light and this has just not been a problem. The remote control was another issue I read about but since I programmed my FIOS remote to work the TV, this hasn't been an issue either. I could see what other users were talking about with the remote but this should not be a reason to stay away from this TV. Finally, I read a lot of negatives, especially from CNET, about the red "touch of color" but the red is really subtle and actually adds a little character to the set.. Overall, an absolutely amazing picture on a set that was exceptionally easy to set up. I was glad I did my research and really happy about choosing this TV. I'm going to buy a smaller version of the same TV for our bedroom.. 

$$;
Pros:. Basic setup was a piece of cake. 
Cons:. nothing so far, it hasn't even reset. 
Summary:. I bought this for $1895 for the superbowl and am loving it. 

$$;
Pros:. I have not bothered to calibrate my new 52A650 - out of the box it is breathtaking. Many inputs; many, many adjustments; USB support is brilliant. Handles non-1080 and SD sources very well.. 
Cons:. JustScan mode tends to have a lot of edge-artifacts, but that could be my HD cable's fault.. 
Summary:. I went from an old 27" tube Sony (still a great picture) to the LN52A650. I did 4 months of research before buying. I compared this model to Sony, Toshiba, Vizio, Panasonic and Pioneer LCDs, and to 50" plasmas from the same makers. The 650 was the standout in terms of features and picture quality. Not to mention the design is very nice, swivel stand, and lower power consumption than most other sets in its class. I would highly recommend this set, especially now that it's nearly Feb. 2009 and you'll be able to pick it up more cheaply as the year goes on and dealers clear their stock to make room for the newer models. This thing is pretty-near future-proof.. 

$$;
Pros:. What's not to like. Great right out of the box and even better after a few adjustments.. 
Cons:. None thus far.. 
Summary:. Highly recommended!!. 

$$;
Pros:. The colors are crisp and bright. Even though you can play with the color levels and perform a myriad of tricks to get that much sharper, you really don't need to. The preset modes are great. I fall in love with the TV every time I watch it.. 
Cons:. The surface of the screen is a bit too reflective. I wish it were a flat color.. 
Summary:. Easy to use. Location of connections on the back are convenient and numerous. The red color mentioned by CNET is hardly noticeable, unless you have a lot of light and really look hard. It looks almost black. You can not go wrong here. It is an awesome piece of furniture.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture quality is AWESOME! Has many different ways to connect all your equipment to. Very impressed.. 
Cons:. Don't see any con's at this time.. 
Summary:. Well worth every penny spent!.

Pros:. super classy look. great contrast ratio. amazing colors. great sound too - straight out of the box, much better than most of the other TVs out there.. 
Cons:. none.- its the best. 
Summary:. I simply like everything which they have provided. has all the latest tech specs. also have ethernet port connectivity for latest news, firmware, alerts etc right ont he screen - including weather. simply awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. picture, ease of setup, remote. 
Cons:. none. no problems at all.. 
Summary:. I have been researching lcd tv's for quite awhile, finally picked this one. my plasma screen started to have a black line going across it. so had to buy a new set. this thing is amazing the picture makes it look like you are looking out the window and watching them make the movie right in front of you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing picture paired with my. PS3 for blu-ray and gaming also the Xbox 360 l have over 500 dvd's and 60 Blu Rays l even have 15 hd dvds lol. 
Cons:. I can only think of size l have the 52 inch and l want bigger now lol .. 
Summary:. l sat and looked at the top of the line sony when l bought this and to be honest l didn't see 1,000 dollars more TV from Sony at that time . l am. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture look great of course and the design is very sleek and sexy. 
Cons:. None...everything is great so far. 
Summary:. I just bought this TV yesterday and I love it. BUT...when I was watching a DVD, the picture looked a little funny, it's hard to explain, but it didn't "FEEL" like it was a movie. I felt like I was in the TV itself. I'm wondering if this is a result of my settings (Automotion) and what can I do to turn it off?, because I don't want that.. 

$$;
Pros:. PICTURE is amazing, CLASSY FRAME, EASY SETUP, and EASY to MOUNT. 
Cons:. REMOTE! I USE MY SAMSUNG BLU RAY REMOTE!. 
Summary:. It takes alot for a TV to impress me and the PICTURE on this tv looks like you are iin the movie! Even regular DVD's look alot better and BLU RAY movies look incredible! You will love it! I got mine a CIRCUIT CITY for $1999.00 plus tax!. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture and easy to setup. Great OTA capability and works well with older components. Still discovering neat things it can do.. 
Cons:. None that I noticed.. 
Summary:. I bought the 22" version of this TV six months ago for the kitchen. It is only 720P, but it had a great picture and worked well with our analog TIVO (hooked up via component). I also had a 20 year old antenna in the attic and since we were only 25 miles from Chicago, I decided to hook it up and to see what would happen. Well, it was amazing - we got all the local Chicago channels in glorious HD (OTA over the air). This convinced me to buy the big brother LN52A650 for the family room. I know this spring I will be getting a new antenna mounted on the roof for better reception. I also hooked up our ancient XBox (not XBox 360) to the the 52" set via the composite video cable that came with it originally and popped in a DVD (HBO / Rome) and again was amazed by the picture quality. I had to change the settings on the XBox for widescreen, etc, but I have to say it looks great! I have since ordered the XBox component video cable and the optical sound cable. I can't wait to see the quality bump using those cables. My plan is to eventually get a Sony Play Station 3 for BluRay DVD playback and for better playback with SD DVDs. I am also looking into HTIB (home theater in a box), but my wife hates cables running all over so we'll have to work on that one. So far, I like the Onkyo ST7100 with iPod dock.. So far, I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. A very competitive deal from Circuit City, fairly easy to setup (it was harder getting rid of the old stuff), and it works great with older components. Can't wait for the PS3 with BluRay and a sound system! (I have no connection with Samsung, Circuit City or Onkyo). Updated. on Dec 6, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Excellent image quality out the box without changing much of the settings.. 2. Black levels are fantastic.. 3. Colors are vivid. 4. 120Hz provides fast moving videos with the blur.. 
Cons:. The only small problem I have with this set is that the bezel itself attracts a lot of dust after awhile but is easily cleaned with a damp cloth.. 
Summary:. High definition video on this TV set is fantastic. The picture is very clear and sharp. Has little to no blurring effect from 7ft away. The 120Hz takes HD movies and gaming to a whole new level of vivid, life-like experience. When I first bought this TV set, I connected my Playstation 3 via HDMI to it and watched Casino Royale. I must say, I was speechless.. Great investment if you enjoy watching movies and playing games in HD.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent brightness and viewing angle, no motion blur, 120hz.. 
Cons:. Remote is bad news.. 
Summary:. Well, my 1080p SXRD had the good ole "yellow stain" issue where the top right of the screen starts get a yellow "burn in" kind of weird effect going on, so Best Buy was going to repair it, however after about a month of waiting they determined that the part (the entire optical block) was on backorder indefinitely and offered to replace the TV. After looking at the TVs in the store we decided on this one.. This is a great TV. CNET dwells entirely too much on the "touch of color" in the bezel - our entertainment center is mahogany and the deep red/almost maroon tone of the bezel matches it well. When the TV is on and the lights are low you can't see it at all anyway.. Coming off of an excellent picture on the SXRD I was somewhat concerned that the LCD would not be able to match it, however this one is at least as good if not better than the SXRD's picture, and it doesn't have the off axis issues (esp up and down) that rear projections have. Standard Def looks better for sure.. Gaming performance is excellent for those who care - no motion blur. Takes some extra tweaking to get the picture just right due to the somewhat unique color palettes in games, but once it's set it looks amazing.. Can't comment on the speakers - first setting change I made was to disable them as I have a home theater set up already.. The remote is really bad. Fortunately, I have a harmony remote so I don't have to deal with the one that came with the TV very often. The "click wheel" like thing is just bad news, and the really ironic part is that you don't even NEED it for any of the functions, just pressing the wheel will move through the menus, and faster too. My suggestion - get a harmony or something like it. Everyone who tries to use your home theater (wife, guests, etc) will thank you.. Some of the extras are interesting - network enabled, USB port for flash drives to play music/show slideshows. The other nice thing is the flash drive can be used to update the firmware (the "Operating system" of the TV) so Samsung can make improvements to the software of the TV over time to fix bugs (since an HDTV is essentially a very specific purpose computer) and to enhance features.. All in all, I highly recommend this TV. The picture quality is amazing, the price point is pretty good, and you won't be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. everything is great. 
Cons:. nothing at all. 

$$;
Pros:. Delivery guys were excellent, box did not even have a mark on it and in 5 minutes it was unpacked sitting where I wanted it. Hooked the system up in about 10 minutes and wow, what an experience!. 
Cons:. no comment yet.... 
Summary:. Worth every cent. I will definiely purchase from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001413DF8/?tag=cnet-ee-20"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Boutht the tv a little over 2 months ago and we love all the features.. 
Cons:. there are times that the sound turns off for a couple seconds but comes back. I had a non brand HDMI cable so I thought it was that.. Replaced that with Monster HDMI but still doing the same thing. Other than this, TV is great.. 
Summary:. Anyone out there know what I can do to resolve the issue? Is it tv or the HDMI cable? when I switch to component cable, it's working fine... 

$$;
Pros:. Picture, settings, picture, inputs, picture, picture, picture 1 reviewer said he bought. this and returned it for a sony, im telling u NO WAY full of crap.. 
Cons:. Some people are having some on/off issues but there is a quick fix for this on sams. web site. I have not had this issue. Nor any other issue.. 
Summary:. Have had for two weeks no issues, works great. Awsome picture I seen the new sams with back lighting and just cant see spending the extra on it. This set is better then any sony on the market as of 9-31-08. This set looks better home then at CC which I got a pretty good deal. If theres better it would be hard pressed to see the difference. Hd-dvd seems to have better 3-d effect then my new s350 Blue-ray which is not a bad thing cause transformers on hd-dvd gives me and my friends motion sicknes to ware i have to dial down settings. All i can say is Awsome tv. was waiting for the new sony to come out but got impatient. Well im not diappointed and truly amazed all people who see are impressed. Buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. amazing picture quality, touch of red is very stylish, It is on a swivel stand (it seems like less lcd's can swivel nowadays), more than enough rear and side inputs for every type of connection. 
Cons:. expensive, reflects direct sunlight during the day producing a large glare. 
Summary:. I did my research before buying this tv. After comparing prices and options of many large LCD TVs, I chose this one. This is my second large HD LCD TV, and it completely blows away the olevia I used to own (which was also about 1/3 of the price though). When I watch Blu-ray movies or play PS3, everything is 3D and the color contrast will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is like having the actors in your living room! I was angry when I broke the screen on my old olevia, but now i see it as a good thing, as it was incomparable to this samsung. I went price shopping online and found that all the good deals were from somewhat shady online distributors that had very bad reviews on resellerratings.com and scam report websites. I ended up realizing that circuit city was just as competitive as the "real" distributors so I went there. I got lucky because I was ready to pay the $2400 and when I got there they had a promotion where you get a new top of the line samsung blu-ray player with it (msrp = $400, but it sells for around $250 on ebay). I am going to sell the blu-ray player on ebay and make it so that I pay what the "shady" distributors were offering. the difference is that I got it somewhere that I can walk into the store to ***** if i need to :-) after dealing with "low-cost" online distributors before, I know this ability to go to the store if I have a problem is worth it's weight in gold.. Anyway-Awesome set, I've never seen a movie look this good. My TV looks better than any movie theater, so I'm not going back to one of those over-priced sh*t-holes. everybody wants to watch football at my place this fall, so it looks like I can drink as much beer as I want without having to drive :-). 

$$;
Pros:. The red border; high contrast ratio with deep blacks, briilant colors. 
Cons:. None that affects my use.. 
Summary:. This LCD is just perfect for any use, be it computer screen, watching sports, movies, and HD gaming. I like the red border, it makes the TV look good even when it's off. Many people complain about the click wheel remote and its tiny sound from the internal speakers. However, with this kind of TV, one should have a home theater set up with proper speakers and a receiver, in addition to a universal remote (Harmony) to control all the components. The purpose of a TV is to present a beautiful picture, which this set does very well.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture on this TV is by far the richest, most vibrant, sharp picture I've ever seen. The images actually look 3D. 
Cons:. Complex settings.. 
Summary:. For the money, you will not find a feature set even close to this price. The TV has one of the best contrast ratios and a vast array of settings to ensure the picture is exactly to your specs. If you are looking into buying a 52" set, you will NOT go wrong with this TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stunning picture, 4 HDMI connections. 
Cons:. Shiny screen is tough in bright light...but just get some curtains!. 
Summary:. My best friend just bought this TV and I helped his set it up...I was blown away with the picture. The setup was easy and my friend had already downloaded the firmware update that fixes the reset problem. Easy install using a USB drive.. I just ordered myself one from Amazon - $2199 with a $200 mail-in rebate and free shipping. This base price is $200 cheaper than stores I looked at and the free shipping and no taxes was the clincher. I will submit an update as soon as I get mine hooked up!. 

$$;
Pros:. Auto Motion Plus is amazing, crystal clear picture. 
Cons:. Shiny screen, but and easy issue to plan around. 
Summary:. Make sure to update the firmware once you get this to fix the auto shutoff glitch, and make sure you can find a place out of direct sunlight so there won't be any reflection, although it isn't a very big issue. The picture, especially in dim or no lighting puts Sony to shame. Also the clickwheel remote does feel a bit cheap, but you can just use it as a directional pad and avoid the frustration that everyone talks about. You have the option of switching between 60Hz or 120, and the Auto Motion Plus is really something, it makes shows like the Office and Scrubs look like they are being filmed live, and HD movies like you are on the set. No regrets whatsoever.. 

$$;
Pros:. Brilliant resolution, picture quality, and contrast.. 
Cons:. Speakers are not the best i've seen but there desent.. 
Summary:. It's a very good tv really nice picture quality and colors its almost a sony but the speakers are not that great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Info link is great to check on news ,and weather. usb , and picture contrast is higher than the sony bravia which is only 3000 to 1, I like the remote wheel. 
Cons:. I dont see any cons yet. 
Summary:. the way the tv powers up lets you know you brought a damn good tv. I debated on sony bravia and this and I perfer the picture quality and features on this Samsung.. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb picture quality, loads of options and settings. 
Cons:. Remote wheel sluggish. 
Summary:. I've been doing research on LCD's and Plasma's for past few months and almost purchased the LNT4681. But after reading the reviews on the 4681, I had decided to wait for something with less problems. I kept checking CNET and when I saw the review on A650 I went to bestbuy to check it out. I fell in love with the TV as soon as I saw it and knew this is the one I was buying.. I had a chance to compare it with the xbr5 and I liked the picture quality of the 650 better. As far as looks, the 650 looked way better then the xbr5. I wasn't too crazy about the red at first but it looked much nicer in person then I expected.. I was also looking at the a750 but I didn't think the price difference was worth it for a better sound system, 1 GB drive and the wireless function. I didn't like the look of the 750 as much as the 650 either. I was looking to get a home theater system anyway so I didn't care for the sound system at all and I'm sure its the same for most people. A LCD of this rank is incomplete without a home theater system.. Both 650 and 750 are the same in terms of picture quality. I watched 300 in bluray and I couldn't believe how great the picture quality was!!! I recently started playing metal gear solid 4 and I have to say it looks amazing...especially in GAME mode.. So, for all of you in the market for LCDs and Plasmas, go take a look at the LNA650 if you get a chance and that might end your search. This TV is currently ranked #1 for CNET best selling products(6/19/2008).. Just a friendly advice for all potential buyers....stay away from all the Online retailers if possible. Get it from bestbuy, circuit city or other major retailers..where you can WALK in, get the TV and get out. And if there's something wrong, it's easier to return or exchange the product. Online retaliers might be cheaper but it's not worth the hassel. If they send the wrong or defective product...have fun shipping it back. Most online retaliers have bad customer service and reviews as well. Check out epinion.com if you don't believe me. Hope this helps with your decision and purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Breathtaking picture and details deep blacks bright colors. 
Cons:. If I could find one I guess would be the red border but you can't really see it in person on the review it looks horrible but in person its not half bad.. 
Summary:. When my rear projection dlp went south.. I decided looking for a samsung lcd since I've been seeing such great reviews on them. I researched them on here and came upon this model and compared it with some other Samsung models such as Samsung PN50A550. I compared the two and bestbuy before I bought it and wow so worth the extra money 120hz is the feature that amazed me the most. Watching a BlueRay on this tv is simply breathtaking so clear it doesn't seem like reality. Hopefully when you are searching for a expensive lcd or plasma you do your research and invest the extra bucs it will be worth it in the long run!.

Pros:. Great picture.

$$;
Pros:. great picture, great color with hd signals, fairly easy setup and adjustments. great view from an angle.. 
Cons:. less than great sound and I am talking about the base here.. 
Summary:. owned for a year now and would buy another one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding clarity and colour. So clear it takes some time to get used to, the picture is almost too real. Blu Ray is magnificent. Dvds are better than ever. Dozens of ports, but 1 HDMI does the trick. Cheap on power, low on heat.. 
Cons:. Pretty pricey, Speakers suck, so plan for a separate audio system. Blurry if you are watching regular TV. Useles without the remote, as buttons on TV are almost invisible. Bezel scratches easily. Found 1 dead pixel.. 
Summary:. This TV is awesome. Friends of mine that have plasmas are jealous. I never had any issues with audio or on/off problems. I bought it in Feb 09. You definetly fall in love with this TV every time you sit down. Gotta say though, if you are watching regular digital cable, it is pretty blurry. Maybe there is a fix I havent found yet. I took a picture of myself in front of it with a screen filled with mountains. I show my friends the pic, and they ask me when I went to Lake Louise. HA! Great TV!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture quality; great color; very good black levels; 120Hz; looks cool in my living room (I LOVE the red touch-of-color! It's very subtle - there could be MORE red, for my taste). No pro calibration needed, very little personal tweaking.. 
Cons:. Uhh...Hmm...I honestly can't think of anything serious. If I'm being nit-picky: maybe all the "like" settings in the same place on the menu, and a back-lit remote. What I care about the most is a great picture and it delivers that!. 
Summary:. i'm literally amazed that after owning this TV for more than a year (we purchased it in June, 2008) and accepting many invites from family &#38; friends to "Come see my new HDTV!", that we STILL haven't seen one yet whose picture can compare to ours! We've even stopped going to the movie theater when we found that a Blu-ray disc movie on this HDTV was better than the movie screen!! The new Samsung models and other newer models may now be better than this TV, but I've been so satisfied with the LN52A650, I haven't even bothered to look. I know I probably sound like a pitchman for Samsung, but I did a lot of research before I bought this TV (originally I thought I wanted a Sony) and it's just great that this has turned out to be the best electronic purchase I have ever made, to date! No problems, repairs, or glitches! I didn't rate with a full 5 stars because I can't speak to the techie parts that I may not know enough to care about or notice(?).. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is brilliant, even w/AV cables; no sign of artifcacts, not even with sunlit water (the bane of many digital signals). User menus a pleasure to view, and *tell you* what each setting does. A lot of thought went into this product.. 
Cons:. The remote. Purchase was based in part on showroom floor remote, with *no* clickwheel. Remote included in box was older model...with clickwheel. HD-TIVO remote does NOT work with this model. INFO-LINK a waste of a good idea.. 
Summary:. First Impressions. "Touch of Color" is right--and it's just a touch. Seriously, get over it, with our model (mf'd Feb'09), the red color is so subtle as not be an issue in the least. We've wall-mounted it, and discovered 52" is simply, in a word huge. 52" is perfect for sweeping epics...but single-camera TV comedies are frankly difficult to watch. We haven't used the smaller picture sizes because it just seems wrong...somehow.. Hook up and usabililty were simple and fast. We use TiVo, which apparently strips the time code from the regular cable input, so we set the clock manually; that's fine.. WiseLink. WiseLink is nice, but of limited use save for slide shows. There are no transition controls, so it's pretty basic. Mind you "Basic" on a 52" LCDHDTV is pretty amazing.. Info-Link: YAWN.. You are NOT buying/considering this TV for the Info-Link option! Position of other elements (newsfeed, stock market info) is only semi-adjustable. Weather: you get today's (a weather graphic with a high temp) or 5-day forecast that does NOT include today's weather. 5-day forecast must be at bottom right of screen, which obscures many graphics and information provided by broadcasters. Newsfeed is as advertised, and cannot be customized to handle your favorite RSS feeds. Stocks are better, and include major market indicators and the ability to customize your favorites, either NYSE or NASDAQ.. Remote. The much-maligned backlit remote was not so bad; we do not experience the lag CNET reviewers did. The clickwheel's response is fast enough not to be annoying and in the absence of any "page down" button, is often much-needed, but no substitute for page-down. The remote is also larger than needed, and vaguely musket-shaped, which would be nice if one actually were repelling pirates trying to board your TV, but otherwise is merely "OK." Would still prefer remote from showroom floor, w/out scroll wheel for its size and ease of use.. Video Quality. DVDs were viewed running off a first-version XBOX with DVD accessory, using Composite AV cables only.. Picture quality was stellar, and is as good or better than any other brand we researched. Dark detail is excellent, even with motion (test movies were "The Dark Knight" and "Iron Man"), with no artifacts, dropouts or blurry shadows. Freeze-frames were sharp, but showed some fringing; even small text was easily readable in every test.. Some reviewers have had issue with "edge flash" where the picture distractingly illuminates the edges of the plastic panel under dark conditions. This model has a slightly beveled edges, no such distraction was noticed.. Conclusion. You will be very pleased with this product overall; we cannot say enough good things about it, and will be recommending Samsung products to any who ask..

Summary:. Great Picture! Money well spent. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic picture and I even like the Red in the frame. 
Cons:. The only problem I have is the amount of dust the frame shows, you have to clean it everyday to keep it looking sharp.. 
Summary:. This is one great TV. I have had it for over two months now and it is on for approximately 13 hours a day and have not had one issue with it (of course I did purchase the warranty). The picture paired with my PS3 is stellar and Dish Network HD is also great, probably the best it can be considering the compression Charley puts on his channels. The Speakers are not that great but I don't use them anyway so its of no concern to me, but the only problem I do have with this wonderful TV. is the amount of dust the glossy black housing shows, you have to dust it everyday to keep it looking clean. Other than that I must say if you are looking for one of the best TV's out there look no further you found it.. 

$$;
Pros:. The TV has a sophisticated style and sleek look. I love how the power button is hidden in the television and you can run your hand over it to turn it up and also you function your volume and channel selection. This TV is the best that I had so far!. 
Cons:. There are none!!. 
Summary:. I like this product mostly because of the HD picture quality. Also once I turned on my PlayStation 3 the TV sharpness was beyond what I expected. I like the fact that it has PC capability and Wiselink, is something extra that really sold me on purchasing this item. There are just so many good qualities. I would highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a television.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality, awesome design and 120hz is simply impressive. 
Cons:. Sound quality wich is kind of hard to adapt because of the floor projection, but must need a better sound system to improve !. 
Summary:. Ive purshased that tv and received it today, after that the delivery guy just put the tv in my basement, he took off the the tv from its packaging to see if there was any kind of damage on it. Then, everything was perfect ! So I hooked it up on my tv stand (Whalen). The picture needed a little bit of settings but after it was simply great. I was first scared to get the on/off random issue, but for the moment, nothing seems to be wrong with this TV !!. The Playstation 3 Blu-ray quality is so imbelievable that I was stunned by the picture quality and fluidity ! The game are much better in a screen of this size.... Overall, I am verry satisfied by my purshase, I got the 52 inch model, and everything os okay.. By the way, I got the 2009.01 firmware on it, maybe thats why it works, who nowss.... 

$$;
Pros:. Great black level with outstanding picture quality in SD &#38; HD. Many features like game mode and other to select from. Also many inputs for all your devices.. 
Cons:. If I had to pick one I would go with the control for this LCD TV. The wheel dial my be an issue at times. But since owned the Harmony 890 that control all my devices. This is not an issue for me.. 
Summary:. In my search for LCD HDTV it came down to the Samsung LN52A650 and the Sony Bravia KDL-52XBR6. The picture on the Sony HD mode was not as sharp as the Samsung HD mode the colors was little more vibrant. Both TV's have about the same amount of input video formats. The Samsung had the better black level for the price. The Samsung had a elegant and slick look in comparison to the Sony. Although the Sony is a good LCD TV, the Samsung was price better for the same value as the Sony.. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding color quality. Very sharp with no distortions.. 
Cons:. Still some motion blur with action scenes but the 120 takes care of most of it.. 
Summary:. I've owned this product for about 6 months now. I've had no complaints at all. It's especially good with sports like the super bowl, baseball, and basketball. The picture is crystal clear. I'm currently using 3 HDMI hookups: cable, blue ray, and roku. They all perform well. No complaints.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Blacks, Great colors, Very good looking.. 
Cons:. Shiny, shiny screen. Day time with the blinds open, makes it annoying. Fixed by moving to other end of the couch. Nothing else really.. 
Summary:. I bought this TV because of the review given by David Katzmaier and the CNET team. My Toshiba DLP would not turn on so I told the wife it was broken and "Bingo" NEW TV. I can not really say anything more that has not been said already. Even my wife (a hater of TV who would be happy with a 27 inch tube TV) said she likes it.. The 120Hz cleans up the SD video with a few jitters on some movies but only on Cable do I see this. I cannot understand why the CNET clibration had the 120Hz turned off in the settings but I am sure it was to preserve the film quality of blue-ray movies. With HD and SD video however, I feel it should be set to Medium or Low.. The Wise link is useless unless you get the next level up to stream Netflix. I have an Xbox 360 which can stream the video so nothing lost there. The weather and news streams could be cool but I dont watch Movies while getting ready in the mornings so it will never be used.. PIP is a real problem in general for me. I cannot understand the manufacturers inablility to allow HDMI or even any HD source to go to PIP so my anger is directed to them. I want to play my Xbox or Playstation while watching a game in a PIP screen!. Overall This is by far the best LCD TV for the money and I would recommend this 52 inch or the 46 inch to anyone buying a LCD today.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture is outstanding and bright. You can customize the picture in order to make it perfect. The connectivity is incredible. I actually like the red color... it's very subtle and goes well with my console that has a hint of cherry wood on it.. 
Cons:. The settings menus take a bit of time to get used to.. 
Summary:. I was excited to see this tv after it recieved an editor's choice, but I was also concerned that the color would be a deal breaker. It is honestly so subtle that I hardly notice it. The quality of the picture is stunning. It has 4 HDMI ports and a fiber optic audio output as well as component video (2) and an ethernet connection. All in all, I'm very impressed with the tv and the color of the set is actually very nice!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent image quality, amazing colors and "super black" blacks.. 
Cons:. Shiny, highly-reflective frame.. 
Summary:. I've only had this model for a couple of days, but I can't seem to stop staring at it. I purchased this model to replace my 3 year old Samsung 40" LCD, which I was extremely satisfied with (it's now in the bedroom). I'm "only" using component video cables to connect my HDTV cable box, but the picture has blown me away --- I can only imagine what the picture would look like with 120 hz HDMI Monster cable. I was also glad to find that my set didn't include the "wheel remote" that others, including the CNET reveiw panel, complained about. Rather, my remote has four directional buttons. My only regret is that I didn't purchase this TV months ago!. 

$$;
Pros:. 24p, great black levels, 120Hz,. 
Cons:. some slight "flashlighting" or bright spots across the screen.. 
Summary:. This display offers a high picture quality and great feature set at a reasonable price. 

$$;
Pros:. Most incredible picture I've seen. People and objects are actually in the room with you! Push one button to auto change between sports, movies, and game picture settings. Deep colors and contrast.. 
Cons:. Speakers could be better, but why would waste this much money on a system without having surround sound!. 
Summary:. I tracked the price of this item for around 2 months as I had heard the rumor that prices on tvs were to drop.. Before ordering from an online source I wanted to check to see if another store would match the pretax cost so I didn't have to mess with the shipping option.. Since BB (2200) had previously told me that they wouldn't match an internet price I stopped in at HH Gregg. They had the price listed for 2400, almost 500 more than the amazon price. He asked if he could help me and I just replied "we'll see". I told the associate that I was buying that TV today, and that he had first crack at selling it to me. He knew I was serious, and after he was able to remove the shocked look from his face, I showed him the Amazon price since it was the cheapest I could find anywhere (always come into negotiations prepared) and said if he could match or beat it I'd walk out of the store with the TV. He walked away for less than a minute and returned to tell me they could do that and we had a deal!. I purchased the TV for 1900 (2033 after tax) which was a little less than the cheapest I could find online after shipping!. Usually after spending that much money I'll have a little remorse the next day or two, but that definitely hasn't happened. Every time I turn it on it takes me a few minutes to get over the shock at how amazing the picture actually is.. I wouldn't hesitate on buying this again for a second!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture is great, especially High Def Channels and Blu-Ray Movies. Picture is also great with video games. Several HDMI slots.. 
Cons:. The remote control and the response time for the remote seems slow.. 
Summary:. I tell everyone to buy this television, 42, 46, 52. The television is great, picture is next to perfect. Especially for sports fans this really pops out with the colors on those high def games. Video games and blu-ray movies run great. Picture looks just as good from an angle. Just need Samsung to creat a remote that is more functional and response time to your button presses are better. Lots of HDMI outputs and it includes S-cable, standard video and one added HDMI on the side.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful and very customizable...I can't get over the picture.. 
Cons:. As mentioned in other reviews, the remote scroll wheel is a stinker.. 
Summary:. I've only had mine for about a week, but I am just in awe about it. I shopped a long time for it, and the reviews I saw on this site had a large impact on my purchase decision. I used Newegg.com for the purchase, and with the free shipping I chose the extended warranty just in case. I still paid much less than retail.. You will not regret your decision.. 

$$;
Pros:. If there is a better picture out there it will be hard to tell the difference from the one on this Samsung. Unbelievable HD pictuce and great SD picture. Red frame looks black so I don't understand the complaint. Beautiful picture...Beautiful TV. 
Cons:. Remote dial is way to touchy...this is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars otherwise this TV is perfect.. 
Summary:. Got mine for $1930 at newegg. If this is the size your looking for in an LCD then this is your TV. I think you can spend a lot money but a lot better picture doesn't exist.. 

$$;
Pros:. Features, picture quality, design, 120hz. 
Cons:. sound is not the best out there. The remote is a little tricky to get used to with its wheel in the center.. 
Summary:. I was wowed by this television as soon as I viewed its picture. The colors are vivid and the people seem like they're going to walk out of the t.v.. The touch of color is nice when off and hardly noticeable when on. You will have plenty of options with this t.v. to control picture and just about anything else. the only negative is the sound, not that great for a t.v. of this price range and the odd remote. Nothing that surround sound and a little practice for each though I guess. There is no motion blur which is what I was afraid of with an LCD. It was between the Samsung and Sony and I just thought that the Samsung gave me the most bang for my buck. I was right.. 

$$;
Pros:. amazing 1080p LCD clarity, vivid colors make it look 3D, bright picture works even in daylight room with sun coming through windows, amazing black levels, 4 HDMI ports, only paid $2100 :), no rainbow effect like DLP, the best 120hz processing yet.. 
Cons:. does not ouput Dolby Digital through optical cable when using an HDMI source like I was hoping...bummer! Gloss frame scratches easy when cleaning. Speakers not so great sounding. Remote sensor seems to need a fairly direct signal from remote.. 
Summary:. I looked at a lot of HDTV's and did a lot of research before buying this. I had a DLP that was having issues and was so washed out during the day that you could barily see the picture. This Samsung LCD is a night and day difference! I cannot beleive how much better it is, I LOVE THIS HDTV!! Other than a couple nit-picky complaints it's about as good as they get. The only HDTV I'd rather have is a Pioneer Kuro Plasma, but the price difference is too great...I could buy two of these for the price of the Pioneer Kuro.. You will not be dissapointed, this is an amazing HDTV. Onecall is selling it for $2084 right now!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture perfect, clarity, love the new TV design, easy to understand menu, Quality material used. 
Cons:. remote control spining menu that seem to be useless but the whole remote is ggreat looking at usable.. 
Summary:. I've been searching for the best performance HDTV for the past 3 months straight...Editors have to convince me but i have to see them myself at the local stores. On an off i would drop by circuitcity, best buy, costco and Samsung always have the best picture quality. My eyes don't lie and the Editors choice pretty much sums it up clearly. So yes this TV is a must buy. If you gonna get 46"&gt; tv, get a Plasma!. 

$$;
Pros:. not one like this. 
Cons:. not buttom in the panel. 
Summary:. the best i see with sattelite super good. 

$$;
Pros:. nice crisp picture; deep blacks. 
Cons:. Remote needs PIP button. 
Summary:. I will start off by saying WOW. If you were to put this thing beside some of the highest end pioneer plasmas, I dont think you could tell a difference. The glass-like screen gives the picture that plasma/glossy look. But dont let the glass screen scare you away with the talk of ambiant light reflection. My living room has 2 sky lights and in the day you cant really see any glare except for when it is off. The picture is bright enough to compensate for it.. Black levels are amazing with this LCD, even in the day I can see the darkest scenes without a problem. And it is awesome in a dark room. The other night I watched Batman Begins on DVD hooked up through component and it was amazing even on a standard player.. Games are great on this tv also. I have played a lot of Guitar Hero, Call of Duty Gears of War, and Halo 3 on it via the xbox 360 in 1080p and it looks amazing! With the 4ms response time, this tv is almost as fast as my CRT PC monitor i used to play on.. Some people say the red trim is too much but it is not that noticable and doesnt look flashy at all in my opinion.. The factory settings were near perfect in my opinion. I have the DVD input set to movie mode just because it cuts the brightness down a little so it doesnt blind me at night.. The only CON I listed was the PIP mode. It is kinda hard to find and is buried deep in the menues. It would have been nicer to have a PIP button on the remote like some other LCD's.. Overall I give this thing a 9.5 out of 10. I plan on getting the Samsung BD-P1500 blue-ray player next, then it will REALLY shine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Spectacular picture, endless features, beautiful glossy red finish. 
Cons:. Not the greatest built in speakers but dont let this stop you from buying this tv. Also you need to get a HD TIVO with this TV or else you will have a hard time keeping up with all of the shows in HD. 
Summary:. If you are thinking of switching over to HD, get this TV. Some tvs are really nice on the outside but have crappy picture. But this tv not only has outstanding picture quality, the outside of the tv can be compared to the outside of a ferrari!! The features that are built into this tv are just about all of what you can dream that a tv can have. It has from picture tuning, to looking at the weather forecast. The remote is great and is easy to use. But the main thing you should know about is the picture quality. The picture is so good in fact that when you are watching a baseball game, you will never want to see a baseball game in person again. And when you are watching a program on the National Geographic channel the picture is so good in fact if you fall asleep and then wake up and see a lion on the tv in front of you, you will %100 mistake for a real animal and just run right out of your house and call animal control. Anyways, this tv is the Rolls Royce and Farrari of all tvs and when you are ready to get rid of your old tv, replace it with this TV and you will notice the difference like B&#38;W and color!!!.

Everyone that comes in LOVES the picture.Love the. fact that the TV turns.I have had no problem with glare.Easy clean, wipe down with microfiber cloth.Love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Picture quality (deep blacks). - Inputs (4 HDMI!). - Pretty much everything. 
Cons:. - The remote is kind of kiddy. - It costs money ;). 
Summary:. I purchased this TV last week. Although I have only used it for one week, it is a night-and-day difference from my smaller 32? LG HDTV I purchased in 2006. This TV really lives up to the reviews I found on the net. The picture is simply stunning?. Deep blacks - this LCD rivals plasmas for its black levels. Black levels are extremely important in an HD set, arguably one the most important features in determining its overall picture quality. This thing puts out absolutely gorgeous black levels, very deep and ?inky?. My old set had very poor black levels, never really going below a dark grey color. As soon as I powered this Samsung set on, the difference (even right out of the box at factory settings) was drastic. The 50,000:1 contrast ratio and 4ms response times add to the quality as well. CNET called the picture one of the best LCDs they have ever reviewed, and I do not disagree. Amazon?s product page on this is also very helpful.. The 120hz mode works well, if you like the effect. Personally, I do not like it at all. It detracts from the film feel of a movie, and feels fake and processed. When watching Discovery HD, HD sports or something like that, I could see how you may want to use it, but I prefer watching HD content as delivered.. I have it paired with both a Toshiba HD-DVD player as well as a PS3. Both pictures are just phenomenal, especially the PS3. The 1080p resolution, combined with the 1080p/24 mode the PS3 outputs, is striking (yes, this TV does 1080p/24, Google it to learn more about why 1080p/24 is important).. Overall, I cannot say that I have found much wrong with this TV. During high motion camera pans or intense action I have notices some very minor ?judder?, but nothing that would prevent me from recommending this TV to everyone.. As other reviewers have stated, this TV does have a red tint around the bezel (dubbed ?Touch of Color? by Samsung). I worried about this initially, as I prefer a single, black color to a bezel. Don?t let it fool you, the red is VERY subdued in the frame, really just more of a highlight than anything (and only apparent if you are looking for it, or if the light hits it just right). I think it does make the TV look distinguished, and is something I started liking about 5 minutes after I saw it. The best way to sum up the color is like a very, very deep red wine in a clear wine glass. It looks black for the most part, with just a tinge of red when viewed at the right angle. Being a wine fan (especially reds!) this makes it even more pleasing ?. The sound is standard for an HDTV. If you are watching TV, it works just fine. Not the best sound from a TV, but nothing bad either. Let?s be honest ? the sound is not why you would buy this set anyways. Hook it up to a 5.1 receiver to match the great picture.. The price has come down on this model considerably, with the announcement of Samsung?s new line of HDTVs. If you are trying to decide between this model and the a750, go for this one. The 750 has the same specs, with more built in networking potential, recipes, etc. Personally, I think those are just overkill and not needed anyways. This TV does have an Ethernet port for getting live information from the Internet, though I haven?t even tried it out, and may never.. This set is just a pleasure to watch and you can configure it all day long. Some sets suffer from being too ?basic? when it comes to customizing the picture (brightness, contrast, color and not much else). Not this one. You can really tweak it all you want and change the picture to suit your palate. I REALLY like the amount of choices you have when being able to adjust the picture.. The remote does look kind of ?kiddy? looking, but if you have a universal remote, you won?t use it anyways. The remote is never a deal breaker for me on TVs, and this one is no exception. Some don?t like the scroll wheel, which I can understand, but even if you don?t want to use the scroll, it still functions like a standard remote by pressing up, down, left, right on the wheel anyways.. As for connections, my old TV had two HDMI ports, which is just not enough. This baby had 4 HDMI ports, 2 component inputs, VGA (for computer connections), a USB port, and Ethernet port ? everything you?d need to connect it to pretty much anything you want.. So overall, this TV has exceeded my expectations. The picture quality looked even better at home than in the store. If you are in the market for an HDTV that is a joy to watch, look no further. I recommend this set highly. I hope you will too!. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture quality is fantastic. Esepcially shines via BluRay.. 
Cons:. One s-video/composite video input, so for connecting "older" sources may be an issue.. 
Summary:. The picture quality is fantastic. I have had the TV for three weeks now. My sources are over the air HD broadcasts and a PS3 (BluRay player). BluRay disks on the PS3 are beautiful! They look everything like the demos you see in the store. Even up converted DVDs look better than on my old Samsung CRT HD TV (4 years old). I can?t say enough good things about the picture quality.. Realize to get the best picture out of this TV, you will need a BluRay player. Use an HDMI cable for 1080p or a good up converting DVD player. I recommend the BluRay player; you will never want to go back to DVDs again. Also, watch out for cable feeds. Most cable companies re-encode the HD signals at a lower quality, so you really don?t get the full effect of how good a TV this is unless you use a BluRay player.. Some other reviewers have indicated some drawbacks. I was concerned; so let me put your mind at ease. First, the red tint is not distracting. It is only really visible in full light. Secondly, the glossy screen is no worse than my previous CRT HD TV. The frame is shinier than my previous TV, but that does not seem to really cause any issues. If your TV sits in a room that has windows on 3 sides, then it will probably be an issue. Personally, I use the curtains to cover my windows when I am watching TV. And lastly, it is true that the remote control wheel is a little slow in responding, but the wheel can still be pressed on the 4 ?corners? like a normal 4-point navigation control, so no real issue there. Plus I use a universal remote.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, inputs. 
Cons:. Controller is a little akward. 
Summary:. After several months of research, I decided to pick up this tv....and am I glad I did. I hung it on my wall, popped in a dvd (using an upconvert dvd player) and WOW. It almost looks like you're watching movies made with a video camera-like you're actually viewing live footage of the movie being made.. The speakers are decent but I highly recommend a nice speaker system-I went w/ the Onkyo 7.1 system package-very nice.. The remote has a lot of buttons but don't let that scare you. After everything is set up, all you really need to use is the SRC button and perhaps the scrolly wheel which is a little hard to get the hang of. I did some hunting on which settings to use since there are so many.. Have fun w/ this one. Updated. on May 26, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Contract, picture sharpness, picture in a picture. 
Cons:. When I turn the TV on, the TV searches for a fairly longtime to find the input when you have mutiple inputs.. 
Summary:. I have been looking at the Sony 52" XBR4 for some time now and was going to buy it. When I saw the Samsung sitting next to the Sony, I immediately saw the difference. The Samsung looked so much better.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture is the best, Frame Design beautiful &#38; Unique. 
Cons:. Some glare near a sunny window, Remote could be better.. 
Summary:. I looked at lots of LCD's, read reviews, etc. and almost bought a Sony. However, when I saw the Sony side by side with this Samsung, I could easily see that the Samsung has the best picture and I just had to buy it. I love it except for the remote, but I don't even use the remote because I have Direct TV and use their HD reciver/DVR remote now.. I did have the unwanted on/off problem starting a few days after set up. Samsung has a patch available online to load on a thumb drive and then install on the TV via the drive on the side. It totally and easily fixed the problem for me. Here is the info if anyone needs it:. Samsung A650-Series LCD HDTV Auto-Off Firmware Update: A small number of Samsung A650-series LCD HDTVs (model numbers LN40A650A1F, LN46A650A1F, and LN52A650A1F) have been reported to be turning off automatically. Samsung has released a firmware update that corrects this problem. Samsung recommends you install this firmware update on your TV only if you are experiencing this particular issue.. If you have a USB memory drive, you can download the firmware update for this model from www.samsungsupport.com/650 and transfer it to your set via the integrated USB port. If you do not have a USB memory drive, Samsung can send you a drive containing the firmware. Call Samsung Customer Care at 1-800-SAMSUNG (1-800-726-7864). Please have your model and serial numbers on hand when you call.. BTW, I saved a lot of money (including no sales tax or delivery) over the B&#38;M store prices by ordering online from Butterfly Photo and had no problems. If you are having your satelite company come to install HD upgrade, they will supply the cables, so don't be talked into expensive cables that are pushed by some retailers if you don't need them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek, well heeled, packed with features, beautiful picture right out of the box. 
Cons:. Crappy remote that's shaped so as to fall off of everything, very jittery wheel. High initial cost.. 
Summary:. I studied long and hard before I got this puppy. I was looking at it's older brother in the "7" series but in that I've a full HT sound system, the 10 watt sub in the LCD didn't appeal to me so I went with the "6" series. Marvelous product. Sets up in minutes. Looks beautiful right out of the box. Extremely versatile with an amazing number of on screen adjustment available to the user. Best "zoom" modes I've yet seen.. Remote kinda sucks. It's unstable and while its curved case maybe ergonomically correct, it causes the thing to slide on the floor constantly. The selection wheel is skiddish and can be extremely sensitive. So sensitive as to make navigating a menu tree an exercise in complete frustration but other than the remote, the TVs an absolute champ.. Da Worfster. 

$$;
Pros:. Crisp colour. Extremely bright. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. Glare on screen, but only in the day time. Mind you near a big window with direct sunlight in the afternoon.. 
Summary:. After doing research on some LCD's, I was drawn to the Samsung 650 series. The picture quality was superb and the colour breathtaking. I was very pleased with my purchase1. 

$$;
Pros:. Many features, 4 hdmi inputs, best standard def conversion I've ever seen.. 
Cons:. Glossy screen can be a distraction, remote wheel is poorly done.. 
Summary:. Just received mine a few days ago and it has been everything that I wanted and more. HD signals and Blu-Ray movies look ridiculous on this display, of course. I was worried about watching standard definition television but it looks great on this tv. I'm not technical anything but the display must be upscaling or something because SD is looking better on this than my older, smaller tv (46").. The screen is very glossy, in the wrong place this could be a big problem. Also the wheel thing on the remote is really annoying. It's super sensitive to rotation w/ a delay; bad combination.. My advice is to get past these things and purchase this tv at the right price ($2100-$2350)...Got mine in that range and feel like I got a great deal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Out of box color explosive (HD not even connected yet), 4 HDMI ports. Simple to set up out of box. No adjustment needed for color out of box. BLACKS ARE AMAZING! Instant lit remote when picked up.. 
Cons:. The reflection off the screen is bright, though I wouldn't count this as a high Con. Wheel on the remote can get a bit wild.. 
Summary:. This is an honest and TRUE opinion from a consumer that saved his money for this thing...THIS TV IS AMAZING!!! I don't have the HD hooked on this set and just watching country music videos, I was blown away (I'm not the biggest CM fan). This TV does have a fairly dark red border, if you don't like that... it went well with our dark enterainment center. All the imputs that are available on this set are unbelievable. This TV basically set itself up, I was considering the 750, but opted for the 650 as it didn't have the preprogramed Games, movies, workout videos, and receipes on it ( I implore you to go to your local TV store and find out what I'm talking aboutm to me it wasn't worth the extra. My 650 came with the updated software (I suppose for the shutoff problem) as it was simply tagged on the box, I have had no problems with this set. It is simply beautiful....the colors are drop dead georgeous...and this is just on digital cable. The TV will be around 70 pounds out of box, you will need some help. The akward part was trying to get the screws out to take the stand off. I had to set the TV on its back side for the screws to fall out, so I could mount it flat panel.. The wheel on the remote can get a little crazy at first, when your a rookie. You understand it after a while.. I strongly urge you to spend the few extra hundred dollars for this TV, I promise, you won't be disappointed. Digital Cartoons on this thing look amazing!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic picture. Fantastic quality. Beautiful design.. 
Cons:. screen shine. 
Summary:. Love the red frame, which is very dark with reds blending beautifully into black. A real work of art. Forget Cnet's pan of the I-pod-esque wheel on the remote: It works great, and adjustments are super easy. The picture is unbelievably bright, with colors spot on and unbelievably impressive. Love the Entertainment button and settings. Click in once and Games settings land automatically. Click again and settings change best for Movies. Click again and settings adjust to best viewing of Sports. Click it again and it turns the settings off and back to normal TV viewing. Adjusting for best viewing is that simple: one button on the remote.. The screen is a tad shiny - basically like standard TVs - and if you have a problem with light reflecting on your old TV it'll be a problem with this TV. If you don't have a problem with shine on your old TV, then you shouldn't have one with this TV.. To be honest I'm really nit-picking here, and I seriously doubt anyone except those pestered with direct sunlight will have a problem with this. It isn't a problem for me, and I'm simply mentioning it because Cnet asked to name cons.. Other than screen shine, this TV doesn't have any cons, and the picture is so awesome that it blows my mind every time I look at it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent, deep blacks, true to life color and expanded color range. 
Cons:. Some Glare to screen, but worth it for such a great picture. 
Summary:. I am a fine arts and personal property appraiser and estate liquidator and have a very discerning eye to detail.. The 650 has an ubelievable picture. It feels at times that you are there or watching a play as the blacks are so intense isolating the characters. Once you get used to it you will find this is a great feature. Even the sound and voices appear to eminating from the actor's mouths.. I recently purchased the previous model the 52" 665 from Samsung which I quickly returned to Amazon and got this one, after trying to resolve the issues with a Samsung Rep. The other TV suffered from severe motion blur, jagger, tiple ball effect and ghosting of images that made it unwatchable. They suggested the new 650 which had a faster refresh rate and 120 hz. They were right. I am extremely happy with this set and its compatability with the Samsung upconvert DVD I got with the previous model. It also was very easy to set up, and operate.. Its subdued red outlined bezel works well with the new woodtone stand/cabinet I bought for it. It looks very elegant with its shiny screen as well.. I have two other LCDs. A 26" Sony Wega which is 4 years old, and 40"Bravia V2500. The Wega has excellent true life color, but limited side, top and bottom viewing range. The Bravia has a washed out unnatural look to the color, except for DVDs. However it makes up for it with its extreme clarity. Both the Wega, and Bravia exhibit some motion blur, especially the V2500 when it records a digital broadcast and the movement in a character's face is distorted.. The new 650 appears to have surmounted all these problems with beautiful color, an expanded color palate, multi-directional viewing cabilities, with little degredation. And thank G-D no blur, triple ball effect or judder as charcters approach from mid ground. Excellent on screen programming.. This is the next step in LCD TV development. Myself and my family are very pleased.

Pros:. BEST PIC QUALITY, 4 HDMI , DESIGN,. 
Cons:. THE REMOTE REALLY SUCKS.. 
Summary:. I PURCHASE THIS TV JUST 2 DAYS AGO!!! i love it.. best quality ever. it looks great with my PS3. LOTS OF VIDEO INPUTS. TV LOOKS REALLY GOOD EVEN WITHOUT HD CABLE.. BUILT IT HD TUNER IS GREAT.. I CANT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE TV. IM HAPPY WITH IT. BUT THE REMOTE CONTROL IS REALLY POOR.. I FIND MYSELF PRESSING THE SOME BUTTON 2-3 TIMES TO GET IT TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality &#38; 120 Hz. 
Cons:. TV reset and Jog dial remote. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture, deep blacks, lots of features, easy to setup and use. 
Cons:. Shinny screen picks up reflections during the day but this can be compensated for by angling the screen a bit.. 
Summary:. I have the 46 inch and it has a fantastic picture. Crystal clear and razor sharp with excellent color rendering and dark blacks. It was a snap to setup. Great on screen menus make it easy. I knew the glossy screen had its drawbacks when viewing during daylight since I have 6 windows in my viewing room. However, I did not know it would be so easy to compensate for. All I have to do is turn the screen a few degrees, easy with its adjustable base, and I can eliminate most of the glare without closing the blinds or sacrificing picture quality. I am very happy with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video color/clarity are as good as it gets. Fast refresh rate make watching sports a pleasure.. 
Cons:. TV cycles off &#38; on every once in a while. Screen is more reflective than the 40" Sony,(KDL40V3000), I was using.. 
Summary:. I love this set, and despite the minor inconvinience of it "re-setting", I would buy it again in a heartbeat. The red tint at the top and bottom of the bezel is subtle, as to not be too much, but very classy. Fast refresh rate makes watching sports a pleasure. I love hockey and there is no bluring while watching the puck. Instant movies from Net-flix come through my Toshiba laptop very clear. Blu ray from my Panasonic player is crystal clear. Up converted standard DVD's look nearly as good as the Blu ray disks. The "Planet Earth" Blu ray DVD's are Phenomenal.. The remote is a little awkward, but plan on purchasing an all in one remote in the near future.. Overall would rate this set 9.2/10 and would buy it again.. 

$$;
Pros:. pix quality is outstanding. 
Cons:. haven't found any. 
Summary:. I know own 3 Samsung's, 50" DLP, 42" LCD and 23" LCD. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture Quality, aesthetics, ethernet capable, customer service. 
Cons:. Remote Control (Samsung needs to consult with Steve Jobs on this one). 
Summary:. I know that buyers like to be reinforced in their purchasing decisions. This leads to hyperbole and exaggeration. Having said this- if you've been ambivalent about making a purchasing decision for a 52" 1080P 120 mhz LCD HDTV, it's time to pull the trigger. The Samsung 6 or 7 Series LCD's are cutting edge. I'll skip the technobabble and let you separate the wheat from the chaff. Aesthetically the sets color scheme and picture quality speak to me. Perhaps it might speak to you?. 

$$;
Pros:. has many settings, game mode, 24hz 1080p. 
Cons:. 120hz seems fake, hard to get used to. 
Summary:. this tv is awesome. it has everything i could want. the game mode is key! i use it w/blu ray and the image looks awesome! not a single complaint about picture!!! refresh is high and so many options i don't know where to start. the only downside, if you can call it that, is that i always keep the 120hz feature "off". why, because the manuel says that if "noise" is produced by the 120 hz function, then turn it off. well, i notice that the 120 hz function always produces some noise. i only wish the tv came in a downgrade model w/out 120 hz feature. the contrast and refresh and game mode and 24p are enough to keep me happy till the new HD software/hardware comes out.. 

$$;
Pros:. GREAT PICTURE! Awesome black levels. I have not noticed any stuttering, triple ball effect or motiion blurring which were on the 71.. 
Cons:. This model has bees resetting for everyone. I have had it 3 days and it has reset 3 times. Turns off, then back on again, but let me tell you, when it is on. It is amazing.. 
Summary:. Over all an amazing TV. Will be even better when Samsung can fix the resetting issue.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture is very clear, sharp, and vivid. 
Cons:. I like everything. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set picture characteristics, Cool interface, Sports look amazing especially basketball. 
Cons:. Can't see controls on side of TV in dark since they are clear and on black side, when watching hockey or baseball blur occurs even with the fast proccesor. 
Summary:. Great TV the family loves it we watch it every day, it's very light easy to put up, the swivel stand is great for parties if u want to swivel towards other side of room, The RED DOESN'T stand out in a room where light is not directly on tv and u can;t notice it in the dark. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the different settings and input channels it has.. 
Cons:. None at the time of my this review. 
Summary:. I was looking at a Sony as well but saw this at sears for 1999 on sale. Printed ad and head to best buy who matched. In all Very satisfied with this TV. Bluray movies look spectacular with true vivid colors. Games on here look great as well.. 

$$;
Pros:. the picture clarity and crisp detail in colors when viewing bright or dark scenes and pictures is amazing!. 
Cons:. I could not find anything I did not like about this T.V.. 
Summary:. I mostly enjoy this Samsung because I got an amazing deal on it at a website I found. They have lots of other great home theater stuff like BLu ray Players, Seating, Surroun Sound , etc. if anyone is intrested the site is http://www.hometheatersmartbuys.com/Store/HDTVs.

Pros:. Tons of hookups, great value (Purchased for $1,679.99 feb 15, 2009), great quality. 
Cons:. Read Summary Below.. Known issue between Motorola DVR (Given to Verizon FIOS Customers) and Samsung TV's.. 
Summary:. Verizon FIOS (DVR) Customers Beware.. There is a known issue with this TV and Verizon FIOS DVR's (Currently made by Motorola). Read More about it Here:. http://forums.verizon.com/vrzn/board/message?board.id=FiOS_TV&#38;message.id=6644. The problem is actually related to the Motorola DVR Box and not the FIOS Service or the Samsung TV. However, since Verizon only uses these Motorola boxes you are stuck with Composite hookups to make this work. Basically the handshake between the FIOS DVR and the Samsung TV fails often or won't connect at all.. This means you can't use HDMI Cables to hookup your new TV to a FIOS DVR. This is very frustrating.. There are debates on the net regarding how much better HDMI is to Composite, but most think HDMI is better. It also mean a LOT less cables to run.. Just be aware of the problem. To fix it, I hooked the DVR up to my old 13" TV in my bedroom and hooked the regular box to my new Samsung. This fixes the problem as the regular FIOS box works fine with the Samsung TV, but it does have a drawback.. You can only edit the series manager (add/delete recordings) from the DVR set. So, now I have to manage the DVR from the location I watch TV from the least. It would be MUCH more convenient to do this from my family room where I watch TV 90% of the time.... I hope a fix comes out soon, but I'm not holding my breathe..

Summary:. this is a great product. Updated. on Dec 3, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Uniformity in brightness, ease of adjustments, liked the remote even the flywheel, a smooth clear picture!. 
Cons:. Not as clear in HD as the Toshiba sold thru Costco model#46550U cinema series. The Toshiba has the best clear HD picture of all I looked at. I returned because it was too bright frame transitions during commercials.I know you can adjust the backlight. 
Summary:. Checked ot the sony kdl-z4100 anjhd was horribe at more money. Returned the same day to keep this Samsung. Overall a great TV especially in Standard Definiton. I is simply superb with all the standard def. I have HD with Comcasr but like the Western channel and some PBS not yet in HD. Get this at Circuit City after doing some negotiating on price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture if working.. 
Cons:. Problems 6 wks from purchase. Repeat power cycle with garbage on screen. Must unplug power. Samsung is replacing my expensive new TV with rebuilt parts, piece by piece. I may have to contact the state attorney to get Samsung to replace.. 
Summary:. Regret not spending the extra money for the Sony..

Pros:. Great design, incredible picture, bevy of connections, tons of user settings, settings menus well thought out and beautifully designed, touch sensitive buttons on frame add to uber-cool status of the set, all around great buy! cool scroll wheel on re. 
Cons:. built in speakers could be much better, worst sounding i have ever heard. remote has good feel but all around design, font buttons and no universal capability, is cheap looking for such a great set.. 
Summary:. if you are thinking of a 52" and care about picture quality and an outstanding product, check this unit out! happy with my decision to go with SAMSUNG after Sharp was my first choice. you will not be dissappointed and most of my nags about the product, speakers, remote, etc. will be addressed by most people's home theater anyway. WIN - WIN..

Pros:. Great picture. 
Cons:. Red touch of color doesn't really go. 
Summary:. White whites, black blacks, great color.. 

$$;
Pros:. Had a stunning picture, deep black levels. 
Cons:. Fixing the sound issue with firmware ruined the picture. 
Summary:. Great TV with the original firmware and CNET dark room setting. Truely amazing picture, sat for days just watching anything on HD boring or not. Internal speaker would come on when showing it was off, fixed it with firmware. Problem is now CNETs calibration is way off. Talk about a buzz kill for 3K.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture Quality, High Tech Design. 
Cons:. Remote, Delicate Bezel. 
Summary:. I've had this TV for about 1 week now, the picture is very clear and the overall look of the unit is beautiful. I dont like the wheel on the remote, it is sometimes unresponsive making it difficult to use, and I have used a lot of remotes in my day. The bezel got scratched by my finger prints when lifting it up onto the wall mount bracket, it seems way to delicate, like you cant even touch it. It should have a protective masking that is removed after you install it. I would reccomend this unit to a friend.. 

$$;
Pros:. great picture,loads of options. 
Cons:. some "flashlighting"in up left corner. 
Summary:. best looking lcd imho.unsure about the 120hz,and the black does seem to turn slightly purple of axis along w/ some flashlighting in the upper lefthand corner and very very slight in the right.despite these drawbacks i think it is still the best picture out and still cheaper than sony. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture is awesome, auto white balance, uniformity, contrast, viewing angle, sharpness, brightness. Remote functions are sleek. 
Cons:. Reading through the reviews, I?m very surprised that no body has picked up on the poor audio quality. Perhaps it's due to people using alternate external audio with this set. The stock built-in speakers have a terribly tinny sound. 
Summary:. I am an engineer and they say engineers are never satisfied. Well Samsung, you almost hit a home run on this model. Why did you put cheap speakers in the cabinet? I went back to the store for a second listen and it was there all along. It's hard to make out audio quality in a store but it's noticeable. Like I mentioned above, if you augment your audio experience with a surround sound or other type of audio system, then you have no problem here. The bezel is a dark red and I think looks very nice. Overall, other than the cheap car speakers, a great set.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good size for the price.. Wonderful color reproduction.. Nice selection of inputs.. 
Cons:. Awkward "wheel remote".. 120hz artifacts on higher settings.. Complicated video mode selections.. Bad menu layout.. Glossy screen.. 
Summary:. This Samsung set is great for viewing HD satellite programming or Blu-ray movies. The set is nice and slim, very bright, has great color reproduction and contrast, and boasts an overall handsome design. As always the devil is in the details, and this is where this Samsung set falls shy of greatness.. Firstly, the menus. Properly calibrating this tv on your own is a big hassle because of limited menu options. There are only three presets, and through trial and error I discovered that the "cinema" mode was the only one which allowed you to access the "warm" (correct) color temperature settings. Oddly you have to alter the presets instead of being able to create a custom setting of your own, a big oversight considering that you can create your own custom audio preset but not one for the video. Bad design. Once you check your color, contrast, and color temp settings the set performs extremely well. My other complaint here is the 120hz processing. After watching for a few weeks I simply can't get accustomed to it. On the highest setting the de-judder processor looks crazy-unnatural and boasts visible artifacts. The lower settings are tolerable but still odd looking to my eyes. This falls to personal preference as to whether or not you like 120hz on or off, but for my money I think the extra cash dropped on this set could have been better spent elsewhere, especially considering the artifacts present on the "high" setting. With 120hz set to off, and the set properly calibrated though, this tv really shines. Every Blu-Ray disc I've seen looks great, well as long as the movie itself boasts a good transfer, and broadcast HD programming looks very nice as well.. The remote design is my only other major complaint, but boy is it a big one. This remote sucks, plain and simple. I've owned a few other Samsungs and they all featured nice remotes, this one is just awful. Instead of four dedicated direction buttons this remote comes with a clickable wheel, that can either be rotated or clicked to input directional commands. Unfortunately the wheel is so imprecise that it's basically unusable. You'll quickly decide to only use the "click" function instead of the wheel, but also quickly grow frustrated with the fact that the wheel refuses to remain stationary. Be prepared to do a lot of backtracking through menus because of errant commands. Also the remote sensor is located on the lower right hand side of the television, so if anything is obscuring the view, say a ps3, satellite box, or 360, you might find yourself stretching or craning your hand in odd positions to make line of sight contact with the television.. The glossy finish on this set makes it look great in stores when light is directed away from it's surface, but once you get this into your home it's an outright pain to get it positioned correctly. You either have to rearrange your viewing area so that any natural light sources are behind the set, or place the set in a completely dark environment. Not a big beef because it is one that can be managed, but I think I fell for the sexiness of the glossy screen, in retrospect a matte finish would have been better.. All things considered this television is very nice. I expected more from the 120hz de judder technology, but I've found that it simply makes the picture look unnatural (things seem strangely fast) or it causes visible artifacts on the higher settings. On high the 120hz processor creates a heat shimmer like effect on the screen, making watching fast action sequences nauseating to behold. Of course the solution is simple, turn it down or turn it off. I like the flim-like look of standard 60hz 24p video, but if the 120hz processor could render video in such a way that didn't cause me to lose my mind ... I would be very happy. Again, let me reiterate that this set is wonderful, despite the shortcomings of its 120hz processing. I paid 2500 for this set new, which is comparable to other sets of this size, even some without the 120hz tech, regardless of its flaws. Just keep in mind that if you don't like 120hz, the hot HD tech of the moment, then you should consider buying a set from a previous generation. You can get the same size set for far fewer dollars, but you will be sacrificing color reproduction and contrast levels to do so. Bottom line: I would, and do, recommend this set to anyone in the market for a 52'' lcd television..

Pros:. I like this product couse it is bery slim. 
Cons:. I like all this. 
Summary:. it's my dream, couse if I have this product my life will be happy. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture. Many input options. I like being able to input my computer image on. the screen.. 
Cons:. I have owned the Samsung LN52A650A since May of 2008. Up until 2 weeks ago everything was fine.. Then the dreaded On/Off power cycling on its own (capacitors ?) started. I have not contacted. Samsung yet but will today. TV unusable in this condition.. 
Summary:. If Samsung makes good on the repair in a reasonable time then I will chalk the experience up as just. unfortunate and mildly irritating. If Samsung says that the warranty has expired and the problem is mine. then I will have to make known to as many people as possible they will not stand by their product. $2500. is just too much money especially the way the economy is now for a LCD that only lasts for a little over 2 years.. 

$$;
Pros:. 120 hz processing best left at low. colors jump out sometimes.. tons of tweaking. fairly light in weight. swivel stand is nice. 
Cons:. uneven backlighting when screen is dark or dark scenes.. colors show artifacts on hdtv programming. price too high. useless remote. GLARE. 
Summary:. i tried both sonys kdl52w4100 and this model side by side for over a week,. glare of this tv is annoying. hdtv channels often looked poor compared to sony. colors about the same to me on sony and less expensive by a mile. bottom line too much glare and poor backlighting and price. might not affect others but to me back to the drawing board. i feel sonys quality and picture looks better overall. i was a samsung fan for a long time but quality has dropped. too bad. i see they have a new led backlit 950 series now so maybe ill change my mind as you can control dark areas like a map which tells me samsung would rather bring a new model in than address the issue of backlight. as far as blu ray i saw no diff in pq between sony and this. both were great but no glare on sony as they use 3m filter.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture was bright and sharp on this Samsumg A650 LCD TV until it didn't work any more.. 
Cons:. Reflective glare from south facing windows, even when blinds are closed. Best to watch TV after sunset.. Much bigger problem - TV picture went "black" about 30 days after purchase. Sound still audible, but for some reason the picture failed.. 
Summary:. Waiting to find out what is wrong with the TV screen. It was a very nice picture (except for reflective glare) while it lasted, which is about 4 weeks.. We phoned Samsung, who referred us to a repair person from another town to try fixing the problem. It's been about a week now, with no functioning TV. No word on when we will get the TV fixed or be given a replacement.. Has anyone heard of this problem before with a Samsung LN52A650 LCD TV?. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing quality! I found the multimedia hookups to be particularily useful (showing the vacation photos straight from the camera).. 
Cons:. The black bezel that surrounds the screen however, came with a small gap that has been widening ever since I bought it.. 
Summary:. With every product, there's always an outlier or one with some particular defect. I hope I was the only one who was unfortunate enough to buy the defected one. The television that I had bought came with a very small gap between the screen and the bezel. Thinking nothing of this, I ignored it until I passed by it again a few days before the 30 day return policy expired. The gap had widened and it seemed like only a matter of time before the entire bezel came off the tv. After an unsuccessful attempt at finding a resolution to the problem at the electronic store I bought the tv from (apparently the electronic store that I bought it from couldn't take back damaged items.. slightly counterintuitive.. why would i return something I liked unless it wasn't damaged?), I called Samsung. Samsung conveniently said they couldn't repair any "cosmetic damage". The bezel that was falling off due to cheap equipment or glue was "cosmetic damage", which rendered the cause of the problem unknown. I was unsatisfied with the television but even more so with the Samsung customer service and will not be buying any more of their products.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great connectivity options and PQ.. 
Cons:. Power supplies on this TV are going to fail within a few months of use. The design of the power supply is bad. They have used lower power components to save some money in manufacturing costs.. 
Summary:. They should recall this TV's and replace all the Power Supplies.. Fortunately I purchased the extended warranty from BB and they replaced the power supply with a new one with better capacitors. I hope it last longer.. I have even e-mailed David Katzmaier to let him know but got no response.. The bezel scratches easily.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its a good LCD with lots of available inputs.. 
Cons:. It gives up so much heat that will make your room like hell. You have turn to maximum coolness for the setting of your aircon to lessen the heat it emits.. 
Summary:. If you have money, buy an LEDtv instead. Although, with my own eyes i can not differentiate the picture quality difference from and LCDtv, the heat it emits is a great factor for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, picture, blacks, color, price!. 
Cons:. Background motion &#38; Touch of Color Red. It's subtle, but I do not prefer the red bezel and the shinny bezel in general is reflective and distracting.. 
Summary:. MOTION is awkward, I don't know if it's the image processing or what, but certain motion is annoying and distracting. For example, when you are watching motion on a fixed background, things look pretty good. As soon as the background moves the entire picture feels awkward as if the motions are not natural. People seem to be sped up. I'm trying to describe a picture with words but it's almost as if motion is unnatural and exaggerated. Similarly, if the filming method has the camera in perpetual motion compared to the background this can be extremely distracting for the same reason. I have a Sony XBR 4 in the house and although the blacks are smoke grey at least the motion feels right. I don?t know how to explain it but CNET should have some mention of this in their review. In retrospect I should have purchased the Sony Z series but I'm not THAT disappointed with the Samsung.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the slim look and touch of color. The 650 has a problem with the auto on/off. The fix is available on line. 
Cons:. The 650 has a problem with the auto on/off. The fix is available on line, but if you tv won't come on you can't apply the firmware upgrade. It will take a month to get a tv replaced under warranty. It's a lot of $ for not TV. That's too long!. 
Summary:. My biggest problem is that I chose this Samsung over the Sony. I spent a lot of money for this TV. It is right in the middle of Football Season and I am stuck with my old TV which is not HD. I am still paying for my HD provider. I should have bought the Sony.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture on this TV is beautiful.. 
Cons:. This Tv scratches if you look at it wrong!!!!. 
Summary:. The plastic bezel around the tv scratches even when using a microfiber cloth and spray made of distilled water. I bought a kit especially for plasma, lcd, and led tvs and it scratched this tv to hell. It's horrible. It was the Geek Squad guy who came to collaberate the TV that first noticed them and now it has become a thorn in my side. I hate the fact that just after 30 days (right out of the return period) this TV already looks like this. When I invest in a major appliance, we keep it quite a while and the thought of having a TV that is soooooo messed up already, eats me up. When you unpack this TV, there is a sticky plastic "protector" that is used in packing this TV. When you pull this plastic off, it leaves sticky glue on the frame. (I'm not sure if this may be the cause of the scratches itself) To get this glue off, you must apply pressure when using the cloth provided and water. When doing so, it will scratch the plastic like you would not believe! This is clearly a manufacturing defect. I also purchased a Sony for the bedroom at the same time and it looks nothing like this TV cleaned exactly the same way. There are NO scratches at all on the Sony LED, however, the picture does not measure up to the Samsung.. 

$$;
Pros:. BluRay with Monster cable looks great.. 
Cons:. The picture on digital transmissions is very blurry,especially when there is movement. It's better on HD but still noticeable.. 
Summary:. It is being returned tomorrow. Tried all the troubleshooting tips. Customer service was not helpful at all. Even changed from satellite to cable. Picture still blurry especially when there is rapid movement. It's better when on 4:3 but then you are only using 1/2 the screen. If I wanted that size screen, I could have bought one and saved lots of money. Not what I expected on an "upgrade", can't wait to get my old TV back from storage.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture.. bad price. 
Cons:. bad workmanship- bad policies.... JUST A HEADACHE.. 
Summary:. I purchased my TV on Jan 7/09. I woke up on Feb 22/09, to find that the control panel, and the remote did not work. I did all trouble shooting and that did not fix the problem. I phoned Samsung and they will not replace the TV. I phoned the store where I purchased it, and there was nothing they would do for me. SO it looks like I paid just under $3000 for a TV that has already broke. NOT VERY HAPPY- people beware of this product. I would not have bought this TV, if I knew. BUYER BEWARE. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice TV, nice picture. 
Cons:. No useful PIP capability. If you're looking for PIP, do NOT buy this TV (or any other Samsung of this generation). There is no easy way to turn it on, to change PIP channels, to swap audio, or to swap picture.. 
Summary:. Without any real PIP capability, this TV isn't much better than a no-name branded TV that has PIP.. Listen up Samsung!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the color tone, compare to other brands at the store, this model look okay with setting in 480i, 780, etc. other brand looked fuzzy and not clear but this model look okay. The side input. Tech support work on Thanks Giving day.. 
Cons:. not working right out of the box. tv intermittently change color for 1 sec and goes back to normal. picture setting go back to default when power is off. can see the reflection on the screen but not big deal for me.. 
Summary:. Only have this tv for 2 days. For $2K I should have taken the sony with the same price and same spec. I read the review for this LN52A650 and everyone given high marked. The tv color changes intermittently sometime and simetime a flash of brightness. Wasted all my free time trying to change setting and cables/wiring, dvd, calling tech support and input but the color change and flashes still there. It become irritating after a while when you are watching the movies.. I like the side input because I do like to view pictures on my tv and plug in my ps3 game often.. I was looking forward to showing off this tv to my family and friends for Thanks Giving. Now on Thanks giving day I am calling tech support. They will have someone come over to take a look at the problems in 3 or 4 days. But with busy schedule who have time to resolve issues after spending $2k for a tv in a gloomy economy..

Pros:. The Picture. 
Cons:. "InfoLink" Feature Misleading.. 
Summary:. InfoLink Will Not Work as Advertised. Class Action Lawsuit may be necessary.. Samsung claims its new InfoLink" RSS, on Series 6 and Series 7 LCD and Plasma HDTVs, provides content directly from USA TODAY when users connect their Samsung Series 6 or Series 7 LCD and Plasma HDTV to the Internet via the integrated Ethernet port. &&&&&IT DOES NOT WORK .. Samsung will not provide a refund.. 

$$;
Pros:. Had decent picture quality.. 
Cons:. Build Quality/Reliability.. 
Summary:. I was reluctant to purchase a Samsung product to begin with, but it came highly rated from reputable consumer and electronics evaluators (i.e. CR, CNET, etc) for picture quality and adjustability. I decided to go for it and purchased a LN52A650 in October 2008. I enjoyed it thoroughly with my 7.1 surround sound, HD cable channels, PS3 games, and Blu-ray discs. Then in May 2010, it began rapidly cycling on/off for no apparent reason. A little online research will reveal that this has not been an isolated problem.. Samsung tech support, customer service, and repair people were all very friendly, but that does not make up for the fact that the TV was out of warranty and they weren't inclined to do anything about it. The earliest appointment was two weeks out and the window was an utterly inconvenient seven hours. I took a day off from work, spent $95 for the guy to spend 15 minutes with it, and was told it needed the LCD panel replacement. The panel and labor would cost nearly a grand and it would take at least a week for the part to ship from California. No guarantee that after the repair I wouldn?t have the same problem again.. It is sad that the reliability with these TV?s has been so bad. The repair guy acknowledged that they give him job security. It is even more disappointing that Samsung doesn?t stand behind their products more. I guess if I had less faith in Samsung from the start, I?d have gotten an extended warranty. I just thought they had better credibility after having read all the reviews. Now all I?m left with is a really expensive paperweight and the solace of knowing that as the ?go-to guy? for all things electronics with my family and friends that I will effectively prevent a great deal of others from purchasing any Samsung products in the future.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great display. looks beautiful. 
Cons:. Unreliable. Reflective surface. 
Summary:. This TV has excellent picture quality but it is not reliable. Like the 5 series these TVs suffer from firmware defects such as abrupt TV shutdown. Samsung took 2 full months to fix my TV. SO i had no TV for 2 months. I decided to sell soon as i got the refurbished replacement and bought the sony w4100. much better choice. i was always a sony dude but decided to move to samsung and i was disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture when it leaves itself on.. 
Cons:. ON OFF issue, I've had the firmware upgrade and 2 circuit boards replaced so far, it's actually worse now. Waiting for another service visit, I bought it a month ago.. 
Summary:. Great picture, but Samsung needs to get their act together and fix a problem that is far too common for this model TV.. Updated. on Feb 6, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. This TV it self is awesome, I couldn't be more happy with it. Great picture, great built in sound even, plenty of inputs.. 
Cons:. The red Touch of Color frame is made of plastic and it scratches like crazy. Any contact with any material on the frame *will* scratch it. Microfiber cloth, just washed hands -- it doesn't matter, the thing will scratch like crazy!. 
Summary:. I love the TV, but despise the way that it scratches soooo easily, and that Samsung doesn't care, and won't admit it's a known problem, despite having provided them detailed examples of other people that have had the same problem. Samsung doesn't care. They consider it cosmetic and therefore not their problem. Shame on you Samsung, it is your problem and it's a design flaw! You're letting a piece of plastic ruin an otherwise superb piece of equipment.. The scratches really are the deal breaker for me. I wouldn't recommend this product, or any Samsung product for that matter since they don't care about this design flaw.. 

$$;
Pros:. Samsung does not solve their problems. 
Cons:. Seriously Bad Customer Service. 
Summary:. Samsungs Cust Svce sucks!!!If you ever have a problem..you bought from the wrong company.I called with a problem &#38; was not helped but put on hold for 10 mins then transferred to the small appliance dept!Its a Tv guys!I called back and asked questions from another rep who really didnt want to admit to the problem but only half heartedly in the end. I called back only to be told by a supervisor that it was the retailers problem. I told her not to dump a technical writing problem on a retailer.Next I found other horror stories online &#38; called their executive customer service at 800-522-7341...she too was full of apologies about my treatment &#38; then hung up! What is wrong with a company who doesnt address a cutomer problem.This company is not on the stock exchange only on the Korean exchange.Some of their executives have been arrested for fraud!Researching Samsung online they have alot of Technical problems with alot of their products...They want your money but dont want to solve their screw-ups!Next time i will buy another brand. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture. 
Cons:. TV has major design flaw in the power circuit. It will almost certainly stop working in 2-3 years. Samsung knows of this issue and refuses to address it. I will not be buying another Samsung!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great TV. Bought two - one for myself and one for my parents. Still have mine without any issues. My parents, on the other hand, is just shy of 2 yrs old and has died. It makes a clicking noise and doesn't turn on.. 
Cons:. Quit working in less than 2 yrs. I bought the TV because of the great reviews on CNET. THe problem is nobody looks at longevity.. esp CNET with their reviews. .. 
Summary:. STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG. Still awaiting the repair since its under warranty.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture quality when working but was basically a lemon and failed to work often.. 
Cons:. Samsung offered very poor customer service. TV broke down at 10 months. They fixed it under warranty. It broke down again three months later and now Samsung refuses to fix it. Also this TV has poor PIP functionality (does not allow video-in PIP).. 
Summary:. We bought this TV as it got a good review by CNET but nothing warned us about the lack of service offered by Samsung. The TV broke down in the first 10 months. Samsung sent someone out to fix it but it had to go into the shop and parts had to be ordered. It was then returned. Just three months later it broke down again and now Samsung says that they will not fix it. This was a $2,800 TV and we got less than a year of service out of it. I suggest that CNET consider warning anyone considering purchasing any Samsung product about Samsung's lack of customer service and its refusal to stand behind its products.. 

$$;
Pros:. The tv worked good for 23 months and the picture went blank. 
Cons:. RELIABILITY. 
Summary:. I BOUGHT THE SAMSUNG HPT-5064 50" PLASMA TV ON MARCH 14 2008.IT WORKED GREAT UNTIL ABOUT DECEMBER OF 2009 WHEN I STARTED HEARING A SNAPPING NOISE.ON FEBRUARY 14 2010 THE PICTURE WENT BLACK,WITH SOUND ONLY.I CALLED SAMSUNG CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY BASICALLY TOLD ME "ITS NOT OUR PROBLEM".FROM WHAT I HAVE BEEN READING ON THE INTERNET THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH SAMSUNG TVS. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THESE TVS-THIS IS HAPPENING TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE..I CALLED A TV REPAIR TECH AND HE SAID IT WOULD PROBABLY COST $400.00 PARTS AND $300.00 LABOR TO REPAIR THE TV BUT COULD NOT GUARANTEE IT COULD EVEN BE REPAIRED.A $1300.00 TV SHOULD LAST MORE THAN 23 MONTHS.I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN AND WILL TELL EVERYONE I KNOW HOW BAD THEIR PRODUCTS ARE.IM SURE AM HAPPY I DIDNT GET RID OF MY 15 YEAR OLD 50" HITACHI PROJECTION TV IT STILL WORKS PERFECTLY.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought this TV based on review and articles in which I found on the internet. This TV really does have an amazing picture. Hence, the 1/2 star.. 
Cons:. Reliability is horrible!. 
Summary:. I have owed this TV for 18 months. The other day I powered on and it continued to make a "clicking" sound. No picture and no sound. Google the problem and guess what, there are 100's if not 1000's of posts with the exact same issue. Apparently the capacitors associated with the power supply have been failing. So, reluctant to attempt the repair myself, I had someone come to the house to repair. The repairman would replace the caps but would not guarantee the work. With a new complete board replacement, ($120 more), I would get a 3 month warranty. Samsung needs to stand behind there products! There is obviously a design/hardware problem here! Oh yea, to make matters worse, I bought a 26" Samsung 2 weeks ago. Never again...... 

$$;
Pros:. I liked the picture when the television actually worked. However, it doesn't, and this is a rampant problem with Samsungs I have now learned called "Power Cycling".. 
Cons:. The television will simply quit working after a short period of time because there is a fundamental problem with the power supply. Instead of issuing a recall, Samsung put out a Firmware update that doesn't fix the problem. DO NOT BUY THIS TELEVISION. 
Summary:. Samsung customer service is terrible, even to the point of conflating the problem, I believe purposely. They tried to claim the warranty wasn't bought through them, even though it is clearly a Samsung policy, has a Samsung logo on it, a Samsung number to call for service, etc. They did finally admit it was a Samsung policy, but only after I threatened legal action.. I do not trust a company that knowingly sells $2000 TV's they know will break or need immediate service right out of the box. It is a scam, and CNET professional reviewer needs to pay more attention to detail. The problem is ALL over the internet, and yet CNET gives it a 4 star review? What a joke.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing good about Samsung TVs. In less than 2 yrs, I had to trash the TV because one of the electronic parts went bad.. 
Cons:. Nothing good about Samsung TVs. In less than 2 yrs, I had to trash the TV because one of the electronic parts went bad..
