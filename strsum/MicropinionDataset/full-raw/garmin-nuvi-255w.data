see pro's  .
highly recommend , keep your eyes open for sales on it , i picked mine up at staples for $139  .
i had an awful experience with an alpine gps  .
the garmin nuvi 255w is competively priced and it is quick to calculate instructions  .
the image on the screen makes it very clear when and where to turn  .
i am very happy with the product so far .
this product is very nice and works great  .
if you need a low cost dependable gps unit i would tell all my friends and people who need a new unit to buy this one  .
for the price it is awsome .
i used this gps to navigate my way through the twin cities area to get to my home in arlington , sd which is a very small town  .
for a small town guy trying to navigate in a big city , this gps worked great  .
i would definietly say buy it .
150 in best buy  .
i really like this product and have even named it dr  .
nightmare  .
cheesy , but with downloadable voices , it's really fun to use  .
this model allows for customization , so family pictures can be added  .
when the system is not in use you can run a slideshow of all your family pictures  .
the screen color changes based on the lighting so it is really easy to read day or night  .
the most important reason i like the system so much is because it's accurate  .
right out of the box without downloading the system update , it provided great directions  .
the system also has an sd slot which allows for supplementary maps etc  .
without a doubt i recommend this system .
this is an exceptionally well    designed , easy to use gps with an awesome user interface that makes entering locations a breeze  .
i love that the color scheme can automatically change depending on the lighting conditions and i love the text to speech , meaning that it can speak street names  .
i have used it on several trips and it does a great job letting you know that turns are coming up and which specific exit to take etc , especially on difficult interchanges where you might not be clear on where to turn  .
the only feature i wish it included is advanced lane guidance , as that seems like a really useful extra but the 255w does a great job without it anyway  .
there are several ways to enter a destination which is also a plus  .
you can choose a poi which are broken down really cleverly into sub    menus and sorted by distance which means that i can enter just about any place i want to go with just a few taps of the screen , and you can search by place name as well if you don't know the address or anything else  .
generally , it is very predictive and does a great job at guessing where you're trying to make it go so that you do not have to enter in every letter of the place , a big time saver  .
you can avoid certain streets if you want and do many other things , but basically it comes with just about all of the extras you could possibly want  .
it is extremely fast with route calculations and recalculations if you miss a turn , and there is practically no wait time  .
overall , this is a great gps and i did a lot of looking around before i bought it  .
i managed to get a really good deal on it as well , so it is a no brainer when i decided to buy it  .
if you are unsure whether to go for it or not , the best advice i can give you is to go for it unless you want lane assist and 3d building view , which really are over    hyped features anyway and are generally only found on much more expensive units  .
this is the best gps i have ever used for the price .
voice    prompted turn    by    turn directions that speak street names , widescreen display and ultra    easy to use what else you can want from gps .
product ready to use out of box , turn it on and let it find a satellite  .
easy to read screen , easy to enter address , town etc  .
easy to find locations , gas , shopping , fun places to go  .
all you need is an address and garmin nuvi 255w will get you there .
although it does not have all the bells and whistles a newer gps might have , it's reliable and easy to use  .
i only paid $116 for this product  .
no need for a built    in car gps system now .
i have owned the nuvi 350 , 660 775t 765t , 1690 with nuvi    link and now this one the 255w  .
why you may ask  .
the bells and whistles stink  .
on all of them they all route the same , the interface is the same  .
but on the 660 and up the traffic never worked propertly with msn direct , rds , or even nuvi    link  .
on the more expensive ones with the 3d maps the refresh rates were slow slow slow  .
now the worst one of all the nuvi 1690 i owned 4 of them costed me $487  .
on three of them it froze on the bootup and on the current one i have the hardware for the google search , weather and traffic does not work  .
so i said just get the cheapest one and to my suprise its great for my business i would like the say garmin is a good company to deal with as so far as business ethics is concerned  .
they are giving me back my money for the 1690 even though it's brought the unit from best buy and there customer service is good  .
thats why with so many messed products they come out with i still have faith in the company .
got this as a birthday gift and used it to get from chicago to columbus , ohio  .
while it took me a different route than google maps wanted me to go , i ended up getting to my destination faster than when i used the google map to get to chicago (even though i hit more traffic on the way to columbus) the interface is easy to use , it locked satellite quickly and i had no problems with it in the 5 hours it took to get from chicago to columbus  .
all in all , i feel that this is a great device .
the nuvi 255w is my first vehicle gps  .
my wife gave it to me for christmas  .
m lucky that the one she found for a good price is a garmin , as it  .
s my gps of choice  .
i love it as it is easy to use right out    of    box a few reviewers noted that it comes with no usb cable , charger or manual  .
one reviewer said his/hers did  .
probably paid more for it  .
mine didn  .
t have these items  .
not such a big deal  .
you use it in a vehicle with the supplied power cable anyway  .
if you do use it out of the vehicle , you can charge it with a usb cable  .
mose folks probably have a free usb cable already on their pc i do  .
i use the same cable to charge my cell phone , gps , mp3 player , etc  .
ok i do agree that they should have provided a manual  .
i downloaded the online manual , printed it double sided and trimmed the pages with a paper cutter , punched holes , then bound it in a folder with metal tabs that i also trimmed down to 5 1/2 x 6 1/2  .
it is a little work , but i have a nicely bound manual to keep in my truck's glove box i recommend this unit .
i would recomend it to anyone in the market for a affordable unit  .
may get another one for the back seat to keep the kids from hanging over my shoulder to watch it .
for $170 , it is the cheapest in the garmin brand (from best buy) and works just as well as the other models for basic gps functionality and is great in emergencies  .
a couple of unnecessary quips about how it could be cooler , but as a functioning gps device , it is top quality for it's price  .
note  i do not know battery life .
inexpensive yet quite accurate with location and also with mph of my car posted speed limits of the road , bright screen , good touch screen response good starter gps  .
highly recommended gps unit which will not disappoint  .
i had the tom tom one 130s and it is secretly trying to kill me by sending into places i never asked to go  .
this garmin is perfect , love the shortcuts  .
this is my first car gps that i got as a gift  .
comes ready to use right out of the box , it is even charged  .
i have used other friends gps devices and the map accuracy is pretty good and the design is superior to most for the price  .
being a tech guy i would have liked some more features , but i cannot complain because the few that this device does have seem to be very solid and work flawlessly  .
i really like that it detects light and automatically changes map colors for day and night  .
text to speech is great to have  .
(it reads you the street names) does have a sd card slot for memory expansion  .
i have yet to extensively test this bad boy , but all n all it is a smart simple to use well designed device that you can now bargain buy pretty much anywhere  .
recommended for first time users who can see over features like bluetooth .
i have had gps' for the last six years  .
i have had the garmin pda versions and the laptop versions  .
the 200w is ok but then the wife wanted one  .
i figured i would upgrade to the 255w  .
it is the best money spent  .
i keep my gps simple  .
i adjust claims and the street function is fantastic  .
the maps are really an updated  .
i will be using it for a very long time  .
i stay away from the units with too many functions  .
i believe in keeping the gps simple .
too many whiners bad mouthed this little unit  .
i up    graded from a c330 which is a fine gps  .
the 255w is half the price with added features and works better then my tried and true 330  .
i also did the software upgrade without a hitch and think anyone who cannot download the upgrade should take the bus  .
the unit is on sale at costco warehouses for $99  .
overall i'm loving this unit  .
it's very easy to use , very affordable , and should get you where you're going without all the frills that other units have that you probably won't use  .
it's really a bummer that it doesn't come with all the cables you really need  .
i would like there to be an option to hear the voice you choose to use when you select it , but you have to wait till you're navigating to hear the voice some of the setting changes seem a little difficult to get to , or to remember how you did that last time  .
most of those settings you might only set once , but for those of us who like to change things up now and then , it could be set up with a little more logic all    in    all this is a great device  .
i've had a couple older gps units , and played with a few others  .
i really like this one  .
while navigating it shows on the bottom of the screen your speed and the time you should arrive , without shrinking the map view or compromising the screen  .
another little feature that i really liked is it also shows a little speed limit sign on the lower left of the street you're on  .
this feature does not show up on less important side streets , not a big deal i love how it'll keep track of a trips mileage  .
this is great for work usage if you need to track your mileage .

com/2010/03/22/review    gps    garmin    nuvi    255w    penerus    legendaris    205w/  .
i like it because i can pay attention to my driving instead of watching street signs and addresses  .
the first time i used it i arrived at my destinaton without any errors and since i is early for my appointment i re    programmed it and found a restaurant of my choice just a few minutes drive from my location  .
i would recommend this unit to anyone .
bottom line i'm very happy with it  .
i did a lot of research and reviews before i bought the garmin 255w  .
we went on a small road trip with some friends and she had a garmin gps not sure what model she has but i liked it a lot so i bought one  .
this is a good gps  .
some people that have used the older nuvis might not like the speech on the newer models  .
they have compressed the audio so they do not sound as rich as they used to  .
other than that , its awsome  .
if you buy the unit , register it right away and get the latest maps  .
if the my  .
garmin  .
com says you have to pay for the maps , call tech support and complain that you should not have to pay for a map update on a new gps  .
they will add the map on your account for free  .
i recomend buying it from a place that has a good return policy like radio shack without a restocking fee  .
this is my second one because the other one got stolen  .
i notice a few changes to the newer software like the ecodrive option .
would like to have a direction of travel such as n , s , e or w  .
or better yet ne , nw , etc  .
would also like it to show number of lanes and exit and entry ramps .
good solid gps for the money with advanced features definitely worth it  .
good speed and accuracy make it a winner .
if you do not install the last software update/maps you will have an excellent travel companion .
i borrowed the nuvi 255 from my sister and found it very user friendly while driving to london  .
but it hung few times while recaculating routes  .
must turn off and turn on again  .
it will be good if the gps has option to skip asking the city name when it can detect where i am  .
save my time to re    enter addresses overall it is a good gps but i would find out more about its competitor before deciding to buy one from garmin .
the on and off switch is defective  .
could not find an easy address as route 3 east , instead it has highway 3  .
delay in redirecting me , it makes me turn before the turning point because the arrow and voice confuse me you have to buy all the extras , the battery charger etc .
the following review is based on my experience and may contradict with others ; please review other reviews too before making your final decision i am giving 3    star rating not because anything wrong technically but as overall rating garmin gps are usually better than others as per my experience touch screen is good and other technical specs are good too in my experience so far the route selection done by garmin is better than the other gps i have used less confusion while you are driving on the road , however it does not show which street you are driving currently as a separate line or space like magellan gps  .
this is helpful sometimes when someone asks you hey which street you are on  .
then you are kind of lost for a while , anyways it  .
s not a big deal but i noticed that also like few other competitors it does not beep or chime right before the turn but rather it says in advance like any other gps  .
i would say garmin should provide this facility in new gps , why sell outdated stuff  .
in other few gps you can control and modify how much in advance you want to hear the turning message , i did not see it here also if you want to reroute you need to go deep in the menu , i feel they should design it in a way that it minimizes the efforts while driving besides all these the rest of the gps in technical aspect is very good , gps signal is usually fast and reliable it takes only 4    5 seconds before the gps finds you are on a wrong way and reroutes you , i think its good touch screen is good in terms of ease of touch i is very literally very disappointed to find out the way garmin handles their customers every time you call them even if first thing in the morning , they are busy there is always 30    minuts wait time , and i believe its their standard message when you call customer care number  .
there is a wait time of 30    35 minutes  .
, i am not sure if everyone is free enough to spend that time  .
i have a trick , what i do is i call them from my land line to save minutes on my cell and then go to take shower , when i am back from shower i usually have someone ready to talk to me in some time  .
try it , it works if there is a huge call volume i would suggest garmin should buy few more phone lines and employ few more staff to make it easier on customers , anyways their gps is too expensive , how much more money you want to make i would say the provided on    screen information is basic and user should be allowed to pick and customize their screen information in the same price package another funny thing i found about this model and few other garmin products are , you need to buy a camera before you buy this gps  .
funny han i is just being sarcastic when i called garmin (30 minutes wait) to find out why i don  .
t have the usb cable in my gps box , i is told that they don  .
t provide the cable in the box , but you could use your camera cable , that should work make sure that you download the map update properly because once it  .
s gone it  .
s gone  .
than you can buy it for 100 good dollars or talk to someone after waiting 30 minutes to find out what they can do for you so finally this gps its plus points but there are negative points too over all as a package i will give 3 points out of 5 to this gps right now its the only reliable gps that fits my budget so i am using it .
i bought this gps on thanksgiving day  .
after dowload a newer software and 2009 nov map data , but still cannot find a ca address existed for 1 year ago  .
garmin admits the issue , but will not fix it and gives a new free map download  .
mapquest , google and yahoo map can find this address  .
the bad is tomtom xl330s can locate this address call support team for help , but garmin phone discussion/email reply are rude , atitude is bad and argues with customer    ver y poor customer service  .
i heard about this , now experience it upon power on , it may take 3 minutes to lock onto satelite , even a shiny day and next to window inside a house  .
heard this issue among other garmin gps and do not see such comment on this model , thought it's improved , but not quite to the standard yet  .
it's poor as compared to tomtom (i have a tomtom xl330s , which responds much faster  .
) battery life seems too short    indicator shows 2 out of 4 , but pops low battery in about a minute i will return this product .
my boyfriend bought me the garmin 255w for christmas in 2009  .
it abruptly stopped working about a month and a half ago  .
at first , it would cut off after 5 seconds of being on in my car  .
i thought that maybe it is not being charged efficiently in my car , so i decided to charge it inside using an adapter i had previously  .
when i began charging it inside , the gps did come on , but it stayed on  .
and on top of that , the touch screen would not work  .
i tried to bring it back to target (because that's where by bf purchased it) and they told me that i could not return it because i did not have a receipt , and it is over 90 days  .
however , since my gps cost $170 , i could exchange it for one that cost $130  .
so , i went to take a look at what they had to offer , and found a garmin 205w for $109 on sale  .
i is then told that i could not have that one because it is not over $130  .
all of the other options were $200 or close to it , so i just bought the $109 one , and kept the broken one  .
this is the second garmin gps i have had in my possession , not counting the one i just bought , and all have failed me  .
i'm making sure to keep my receipt on this one , and i will definitely bring it back if it starts acting up  .
so , beware before you buy  .
purchased unit while on vacation in arizona  .
unit continually sent me on a wild goose chase while lt re    calculated my position  .
unit invented exits that were not there and took me to phantom gas station and lodging locations  .
not a good choice for dense population centers .
will try tom tom now because of family members working better than nuvi .
the most annoying thing by far is the fact that the maps were uselessly out of date  .
you're not entitled to an update even when it's new  .
you have to buy it but the update costs more than the machine itself  .
i felt really ripped    off when i discovered this  .
it fairly regularly loses the plot by not being able to distinguish roads and footpaths in some areas the sound on it is pretty distorted if you turn it up  .
the voice in general is irritating and there is no option to change it (unlike tomtom)  .
why is this  .
it's only a couple of megabytes of sound files the touch screen is just a bit too insensitive and you often find yourself having to poke things two or three times until you get it right i is unimpressed by how much time it took to acquire the satellites  .
if you start driving before it has done this it can be a 5 minute operation in general the garmin nuvi 255 is a choice i regretted  .
it had so many things that bugged me which could easily have been avoided i put garmin on my list of companys to be avoided .
by all means , test the unit before buying it  .
if as slow as mine , get a different model or brand  .
with my unit , garmin has lost a customer .
run this garmin next to my old garmin and my old garmin picks better routes everytime they differ which is often  .
when this garmin updates a route because you took a turn you knew would be better , this garmin will always try to get you back on original route even if it means taking you out of the way 30 miles  .
garmin had me do software updates but it still did not help  .
other than that i like the features , etc  .
just not good at picking routes for you .
bottom line , this thing will get you to the street you want to go to , but do not count on this thing taking you to the front door of the address you punched in  .
i tried to find a starbucks in chattanooga recently , it said the destination is on the right  .
talk about directionally challenged , starbucks is on the left  .
what the heck  .
i punched in the address where i got this gps , and it says the store is about 2 miles further down the road than the store really is  .
i punched in my parents address and it says their house is about 0  .
2 miles from where they live  .
i punched in my girlfriend's address , and it says she lives on the corner when she really lives at the end of the cul    de    sac  .
it also thinks there are 200 addresses along her short road , when there are less than 20 addresses along that short road  .
i punched in a friend's address and it says he lives over a quarter mile away from where he really lives  .
i punched in my address , and it thinks i live down the road about 0  .
2 miles from where i live this gps is easy to use , but it's maps suck , and that's all there is to it  .
it will get you to the road you want to go to , but it certainly will not take you to the address you wish to go to  .
if you want that kind of reliability , get a delorme gps  .
delorme has their maps right  .
garmin is directionally challenged  .
i am very disappoited of the instrument it's grap , you cannot rely on during a travel .
the product simply will not work in an automobile  .
it is useless while driving .
this garmin nuvi 255w wo not allow you to search easy for any address  .
you cannot type the zip code for a city always you will have to type the whole city , state/province to get the address  .
in this part it's not a small device  .
i bought it from best buy two days ago , but it's ready for return tomorrow and get tomtom xl 340 t  .
i saw a review similar to mine , but i though maybe that person is not that small , i is wrong so now i have to return it  .
you need a friendly device to the directions , that's it .
) the street i live on shows on the map , but is not available to select as a driving destination b  .
) choosing destination is complex compared to tom    tom  .
need to verify the country of origin and the language you prefer each time  .
then you need to spell the city  .
what a pain  .
have they not heard of zip codes  .
i have owned this only several hours and barring a remarkable change in the experience , i would not recommend that anyone buy this  .
garmin may be reliable , but the experience of using this makes me long for my old gps .
i get this unit , after one of those web garmin updates the unit stop working  .
research in internet and surprise  .
i'm not the first one  .
there are a lot of forums with dozens of costumers complaints the update could damage the unit  .
garmin costumer service sucks  .
i get a tomtom  .
easy fix  .
garmin sucks  .
the garmin 255w had so many problems  .
it could not find my home , it told me to turn when no street is even nearby , could not find a major store that i knew is just about 2 miles away  .
it said the nearest is 21 miles away  .
instructions were in many languages except english and info said it is a 205 instead of a 255  .
i really believe this is just a faulty one but i returned it to the store and just got a refund  .
not sure if i want to try another one  .
will just update my maps on my 3 year old one which is great .
fyi , i bought a garmin nuvi 250w about 6 mos  .
ago ; this is my second garmin  .
i have been quite disappointed with it    for one , the car charger will not charge this unit sufficiently to keep it going while it's turned on , while traveling  .
remarkable , i know , for a car gps , but , according to the garmin rep  .
that i complained to over the phone , that's how the unit works (or doesn't work)  .
why would you buy a gps that will only get you half way to your destination on an 8 hour trip  .
i wouldn't buy it again  .
as if that weren't enough , the maps also were not as accurate , for some reason , as the older model that i had , which i never updated , and it will occasionally not be able to find a location that the older unit would , or , as it happens , will tell me i have reached my destination , when i'm a  .
5 mile or more away from it  .
my next gps will not be a garmin .
if you have any problem at all with a new unit throw it in the garbage  .
do not waste the $ on postage sending it for repair  .
they will just jack you around for months  .
i had a weak battery problem  .
they had me send the unit to a repair station called raytech  .
each time i contact garmin , they give you a different specialist whose job it is to not give you any service but lots of mail me this and that and contact someone else next time you call  .
i gave up and bought a tom tom  .
it's great  .
i hate this gps  .
i have used several and this is by far the worst  .
several times it had me driving off the road , and it is telling me to get back on    meanwhile i is driving on a road ; have had problems finding addresses , primarily numbers on a certain street and it'll change it to a different number ; i just hate it and cannot wait to get rid of it and get a new one  .
there were several times that i would have been so happy if i could have just thrown it out the window  .
seriously , do not waste your money on this    find another one  .
i'm guessing garmin got bad chips from their supplier .
i live in buffalo , ny , so to have a gps that will only work in clear weather is utterly useless  .
if all gps units were subject to failure in inclement weather , i would accept this situation as par for the course  .
i have , however , stood side    by    side with my friend who has a tomtom , on a cloudy , snowy day  .
we compared devices ; her tomtom locked on to satellites with a full    strength signal in less than 10 seconds  .
my garmin did not find a signal  .
at all  .
she also indicated no difficulties finding a signal while driving in a recent full white    out blizzard bottom line   garmin goes back , tomtom here i come .
the biggest thing is the terrible customer service and the hook of a free map upgrade , but if you have linux , or windows 2000 and below , you will not get the upgrade  .
that maybe understandable , but they will lead you on until the 90 days expires and tell you 'tough' but we will sell you a free upgrade also the power on button is terrible , either have trouble turning it on , or turning it off  .
very small another is the accuracy of the distance you save  .
if you save something and you know it is a 150 miles by road in your favourites , it will list the distance as ~100 miles or so , that is because it uses as a crow flies distance , yet if you say to go there and check the turns it will get the miles right the garmin v did not do this , it got the miles to destination right in the places saved also the menus in the v were much more detailed , and easier to use  .
the menus in the nuvi 255  .
are stupid , you'll forever have to use just a general area , and wait , wait , wait until it might find  .
what you are looking for i will not buy a garmin anything again , bought this on because of the garmin v , it is a mistake also , i go to a place i have saved , this stupid piece of crap will take me there with one set of directions , and take  .
me back with an entirely different set of directions , even when going back is a farther distance  .
if your nuvi crashes , as mine did , when performing a manufacturers required software update , you will not be able to reset the unit and have to send it back to garmin for a repair  .
the repair takes 14 to 20 days , and garmin does not pay for the return shipping  .
this has happened to me 2x total out lay or the nuvi 765 with accessories is close to $600  .
customer service is very slow and hold times when calling are over 30 minutes do not buy with out sellers extended warrantee expect the worst from garmin .
