i've had this tv for two years  .
i havn't had any major problems with glare or dropping the signal (just turn the tv off and on to fix)  .
does not happen often .
during my recent deployment overseas , i spent considerable time researching lcd tv's through multiple sources  .
cnet provided excellent info and helped me spend my hostile fire pay  .
this tv is amazing in all areas  .
the shiny screen is not an issue for me since the tv is located in a darker room in the basement  .
i would recommend this tv in a heartbeat to anyone .
i have had this tv for 3 weeks , and in that time i have fell in love with this thing  .
the looks of this unit are awesome , if you have a darker theme'd room then this tv will definatly fit right on (as is the case with my room)  .
the picture quality is amazing , but i dont have much to compare it to as this is my first hdtv , but i can see how cnet says it is amazing cause side by side at bestbuy their is no comparison the main selling point for me that i found in this tv is the price , at about $2500 canadian msrp (you can find it for like $2200 if you look around) it is a steal  .
i honestly cant get over how some tv's still get away with a huge markup for canada (cough westinghouse cough) , so if your canadian this is definaly a tv to be considering .
i did lots of research on this tv before i bought and the two negatives that popped up all the time were the glossy pic screen and hdmi drop out i called samsung and best buy before the purchase and samsung confirmed the problem with the hdmi samsung explained after i bought the set if i experienced a problem with hdmi to call then and give them the serial number and they would have the circuit board replaced at no charge under the one year factory warranty after my purchase , last month , i did experience the drop out and samsung sent out a tech and replaced the circuit board and bingo no more drop out if you've see this picture then you already know its worth the buy even with the short hassell of circuit board replacement as for the glare yeah if you have a window behiind you or a bright light you will see the reflection  .
fortunately i have a wall behind me with no lights and the picture quality is the absolute best i have ever seen  .
hard to believe that there is an electronic product out there that is worth more than the price  .
samsung 4665f oh , the f is for fantastic  .
this unit is all it's cracked up to be and more  .
i wo not bother repeating all it's wonderful aspects which those before have already noted  .
one thing i would like to add though i is able to purchase this unit directly from amazon for $2250 with no tax and no shipping  .
so far i have not seen a better deal .
this tv is simply incredible  .
my wife told me we didn't need a new tv for months , i went ahead and bought this anyway  .
now she is a fan  .
we love watching this thing  .
the picture is stunning  .
watching discovery channel hd theatre is great entertainment even if you we don't care for the particular program content i guess the only negative is the auto sound levelling doesn't seem to work too well  .
the sound still gets louder during commercials and varies when changing channels for once i don't have buyer's remorse  .
the tv is almost too good ; we do not need to be watching this much tv .
it took four 1080p purchases to find one that does it all  .
an akia with too low of a contrast ratio  .
then a sharp aquas that had banding/hum    buzz/and clouds  .
next i tried a vizio but its contrast is too low and 4 stuck pixels  .
( its sharpness could have been better as well )  .
the samsung has excellent black with stellar color all around  .
no clouds/stuck pixels/banding/ and still important the sd viewing is even better than the 36 crt it replaced  .
some have noted hdmi input issues but mine and other new sets do not seem to have this problem  .
ps3 gaming is excellent as is 1080p blueray viewing  .
( hint ps3 offers a free 1080p upscale in its new 1  .
8 online upgrade  .
converts 420p etc  .
movies to 1080p)  .
tv's in the $1750 range may seem like a good deal but buy the real thing if you want to have the best i like this tv with no buyers remorse wife factor 10  .
great price , early delivery and no taxes thru amazon .
i set out to best buy in search of my first hdtv  .
i came across this and literally drooled at the picture quality of the set versus the competition  .
i purchased the set and am now the envy of my friends , family , and neighbors  .
i recommend this set , hands down  .
money well spent  .
the is the best lcd in the market today .
i've had my samsung for three months and could not be happier with it  .
my only complaint       which is not aimed at this tv , but instead the whole electronics industry       is that i now have even more remotes in my tv room  .
why cannot someone come up with true universial remotes that work with all different makes and all types of features of various electronics  .
some work with this or that and some features work on this but not that  .
it does seem pretty silly  .
i digress  .
it is a very nice tv  .
but add a external sound system  .
the speakers are just ok .
i have had this tv for 6 months or so and it is perfect i can even take and put it in the car to my friends house it's so lite  .
hopefully it can stay this good but if not i still got my 3 year warenty from frys .
there's one minor downside mentioned above in cons , which is the case for all backlighted lcd tvs  .
however , you wo not notice this once the tv shows images  .
other than that , this tv is almost perfect for viewing any pictures , playing games and using it as computer monitor .
i had narrowed my search to the samsung 4665 and the sony 46w3000  .
both tvs had excellent reviews so i went to multiple stores to see which one looked best to me and my wife  .
both of us preferred the samsung picture  .
because we preferred the picture quality and the price is $500 less we went with the samsung  .
we have both been very happy with the new tv , it is our first hd tv for the house and it looks amazing  .
consider watching amazon for a good deal on these with free shipping .
just purchased this tv after returning my 3rd sharp aquos for banding issues  .
love this tv    great picture and black levels are pretty good , but not as deep as the sharp , but no banding with the samsung .
this is the greatest tv i've ever owned  .
i work in broadcasting , and i've never seen anything this clear for this price  .
top of the line , samsung is taking over  .
sony is overpriced and sharp cannot touch this  .
xbox 360 looks insane .
the shiny screen thing is so i'm such a geek audiophile anal retentive my 46 4665f faces a 10' x 5' (it cannot get much worse in a home) window and reflective is such a minor issue if you consider the 15 , 0000    1 bonus  .
my buddy just bought the equilavent in sharp aquos (46 his is newer by two months)  .
we both played on his and mine halo 3 on 360  .
he adnitted on game mode mine is pretty good (compared to his)  .
from j that's a huge compliment do not not buy this tv because the reviews that say its shiny  .
i'm a huge gamer and so are my children  .
you need direct sunlight on this tv to make any reflection issues btw the sony sharp looked way worse in store , under their lighting just my opinon though    do your research ppl .
i bought this tv 2 weeks ago and the picture is stunning  .
with my xbox 360 it's even better  .
the only problem with this tv are the preset settings , you need to adjust the colors and the rest of the settings yourself  .
it took me around 30 min to do it and now i'm very please with this tv .
this is a very nice t  .
i own this one  .
very fun to watch hd movies and play games on  .
and even just watch standard cable on  .
the best however , is for the hd stuff  .
very nice  .
watch your football games on this and you will not even want to go the the games  .
there is only one bad thing about it that is very minor  .
the dust can collect on the base and show  .
that is about it  .
it does come with a special cloth that tells you how to clean it to protect the sexiness of the t  .
v i do recommend this t  .

this is a great tv i am so happy that i decied to buy it  .
i have my ps3 hooked up via the hdmi and have not one problem with compatibilty  .
also my hd cable source is hooked up via the hdmi port and no problems there either  .
also with the screen being shiny they say it affects it but as of yet i have no had any problem  .
the tv sits in a room with a door and windows on all the walls and there is no problem at any time of the day viewing it  .
the tv is so good even my wife said that she can never go back to watching out old 27 in sdtv ever again  .
she wants to get another one for the bedroom .
i shopped a long time before making this purchase i am using a directv hr20    700 dvr and a directv h20    100 as signal sources  .
all of the channels look good and directv's recent rollout of additional hd channels has made it nothing short of incredible my upconverting samsing dvd player , connected via component is the weakest source and even it is great the pc connection , dvi to hdmi is the standout  .
windows vista ultimate , on a personally built computer with an evga 8800 video card producing 1080p breathtaking the glossy screen issue mentioned by others is a non issue i am not sure why some have complained about hdmi troubles , i am using all 3 hdmi connections and have not had so much as a flicker great set  .
i spent a lot of time researching for the optimal lcd and finally decided to go with this one , i bought this lcd tv online and paid much less than what a local electronics store would charge for it ($400 less) , the installation is easy and straight forward  .
the remote is nice although it was not able to detect my dish network receiver .
spent 2 months researching hdtvs and finally made the jump to this set  .
absolutely no regrets  .
amazing picture , both in hd and sd  .
as others in this forum have attested , the so    called reflective screen that cnet disliked is not an issue  .
i have the tv in a small room with seven windows , and i have not noticed any annoying glare  .
you'll notice i listed the number of picture controls as both a pro and a con  .
as a newbie to hdtv , i am a bit overwhelmed at the number of adjustments available  .
that's the only reason for a rating of 9  .
it could take me a while to tweek everything to my liking  .
good news , is the tv saves settings for each input  .
overall i believe this is a top    notch set for the money  .
i considered waiting for the    71 series , but i cannot imagine how it can be that much better  .
this set rocks .
this set has amazing 1080p output , especially with my ps3  .
i'm an avid gamer and this tv does great work with my 360 and ps3 games  .
blu    ray movies are also stunning quality only setbacks are the sound and glossy screen  .
the sound was not too big of an issue considering i own a surround sound system but even then the sound was not unbearable  .
it is more of me being spoiled with surround sound the glossy screen is my biggest gripe  .
originally had the setup in front of the window which is easily fixed by moving it to a better angle overall awesome lcd with very little problems .
well i is worried about the reflection on the screen before i got the lcd but after watching movies and playing games on my ps3 im not worried anymore , some people made a big deal here but im not sure what kind of spotlights they have pointed at their screens i really like the sound , alot better then i had expected from just the tv itself  .
the picture looks great watching blu    ray movies and playing ps3 games .
i is initially concerned about the supposed reflectiveness of the screen as this tv is about to find its way into our living room  .
now that it is here , i can tell you that it is less reflective than our old flat tube tv even that one also had an anti    reflective coating we went from a 27 tube , to this beauty  .
quite the difference and the image quality is just mind    blowing on the hd channels  .
i have not setup an over the air antenna , but so far i have to say that the quality is what i is hoping for and the reflectivity of the screen far lower than i thought it would be  .
an other surprise is that i is able to setup the new set alone , as it came assembled in the box , yet i had to request help from my neighbor to move the 27 tube downstairs in case you wonder , i am a discriminating viewer , which is why i waited until now to buy a flat screen tv to replace our old perfectly fine tube hope this helps  .
the only thing differentiating tv from reality is the reflections on the screen  .
i just bought the samsung ln    t4665f and it is point blank the best picture quality i have ever seen (stores , friends' houses included)  .
i got a good deal and it installed super easy  .
the swivel base is beneficial ; the cabinet is super sleek ; the 'on light' is totally cool , and on and on  .
i used hdmi hook    ups (which i would recommend) and just installed my local cable cos  .
' hdtv cable box easy to hook up and the best pictures i have ever seen  .
i'm a college football fan so i don't watch much pro baseball but i watched back    to    back games last night just b/c i couldn't believe the amazing quality of the picure i is looking at  .
as with other top    of    the    line merchandise , it is pricey but now i feel stupid for even looking at other tvs (especially when none of this stuff is cheap really) on another note , i've seen some debate about the necessity of hdmi cables i would highly recommend them for these reasons    .
1) ease   hd audio and hd video in only one cable  .
2) i used component outputs until i switched to the hdmi and for me the difference is very noticeable on espn    hd (probalby would not be on a non    hd channel)  .
3) cost   monster cables are all marketing hype as far as i'm concerned i got belkin hdmi cables  .
2 12' long hdmi cables were only $26 each at a local electronics store .
i did upgrade this month my 18 months old sony 42 inches dlp hdtv 1080 x 720 , after searching and reviewing sufficient material (and review prices  .
) i decided to go for the new samsung 52 lnt5265f , this identical to the 46� , i immediately connected after arrived home  .
i previously got a hd dvd drive for and xbox360 ( must admit that this one does not have hdmi port ) connected my regular satellite and cable box (this one delivers hdtv) comparing with my other dlp i just say   amazing blacks are great better than the sahrp aquos , color saturation is incredible , far superior to other lcd i saw and equal than aquos , the pip is a great addition  .
sound in true hd is superb , many times we do not turn on the theater sound i mean this one has great sound  .
the only flaw came from the energy bill my older sony used 200 watts , this one uses 300 watts  .
i could not resist and got the new panasonic blue ray the image is totally an experience   i watched corpse of the bride and chicken little and my family are still impressed if you can afford this one , do the homework review them and then you may do what i did   bought it be prepare   normal cable nor satellite does not improve the image , actually looks worst than a regular tv , reason   pixelated image come from a 480p source , cable hdtv is another history   pure love , news looks like if you were there and sports ( f1 race cars and basketball) will make you say   ok i spend on the tv , i am paying little more in my energy bill , but this set will remain home  .
also   if you spend this kind of big money for this you must buy a blue ray or an hdtv to really enjoy at it best  .
well done samsung , you really got it this time  .
i own this tv for almost a month and it completely transformed the way we use my family room    we now spend much more time in there watching it  .
light reflection is not as bad as it mentioned here , you can hardly see it with a picture on the screen  .
i am amazed how uniform and contrast the picture is from one end of the screen to another  .
sound may not be as deep as advanced stereo systems can offer , but i don't care much about surround sound , dolby and all other sound enhancements since i do not even make it loud  .
it is a little bit challenging to find a right combination of resolution options between the tv and the cable box , but with some experimentation i finally figured it out  .
one of the last tricks i found is setting up hdmi connection  .
with hdmi cable you need to disable 480i and 760i resolution on your cable box , otherwise you will get a message on the screen mode not supported instead of the picture  .
this does not happen if you use component connection  .
with hdmi cable and progressive conversion the picture quality is noticeably better  .
i bought the tv on amazon  .
com and it allowed me to save near 25% of the total price i would have paid to circuit city  .
amazon offers the white glove delivery which is very helpful since it allowed me to inspect the unpacked tv and to avoid lifting it to put it on the shelf of my intertainment center  .
overall i am very happy with this model and can recommend it to everyone .
this is an excellent value for the money  .
i have been pleased right out of the box  .
the unit is very easy to install and setup to your equipment  .
easy to reach inputs for external equipment on the side hd picture is flawless without any need for adjustment in the room where i installed it  .
tv is initally placed in a room where there is bright sunlight in the afternoon where this unit did not do as well as it's brother the lnt4661 , so i moved it into a bedroom where it is performing far above my expectations and i would not trade the unit for the world the internal speakers perform well , but i am using external speakers in this placement i looked and tried many other tv's of this size and this unit is well worth the money and i would purchase another one if the need arose .
i have been looking for a new tv for over 4 months  .
i have read hundreds of reviews on every tv that is in my price range  .
i chose this one because of the appearance and after i saw it in the store , the picture  .
my xbox360 and ps3 looks absolutely amazing  .
halo 2 has never looked so good , and the game mode actually keeps the game lag free  .
i am a gamer and if this tv did not deliver in that area , i would be taking it back and getting a plasma or a huge dlp tv  .
if you can afford this tv go and buy it now  .
great tv  .
i would change a few things , but nothing that would have prevented me from buying this tv  .
the glare that the reviewers talk about is non    existent unless you watch tv in daylight .
i've owned a plasma tv for about three years now  .
thought it is time for an upgrade  .
after reading all the reviews i bought this tv  .
the quality of the tv is amazing  .
this tv has more inputs than you'll likely need  .
not to mention the black levels are so dark  .
there are also many settings you can play with that on many other tvs require special codes to get to  .
if you're thinking about the best the market has to offer than you should definitely take a look at this .
had to return my lns4695d due to continuous problems and picked up the lnt4665f as a alternative  .
what a difference this new lcd tv makes  .
here are some of the new/fixed items with the lnt4665f over the lns4695d  .
lighted remote control  .
remote control is more responsive (lns4695d remote is very sluggish)  .
much higher contrast ratio  .
more power efficient (compare specs)  .
glossy screen (looks as good as plasma)    picture is very crisp   usb connection  .
tv buttons located on the top instead of the side  .
(side buttons didn't makes sense since you cant see them very well)  .
more picture/color control settings   have not seen the infamous white cloud issue on this model you may have heard other reviews in which the screen glossiness may cause bad reflections  .
it's true , but this has not posed a problem for me i use off the air hd and hd channels look spectacular  .
do not use the default settings  .
review the settings that users already document on the avsforum the only complaint i have is that samsung removed the e    savings button on the remote control  .
this is a good feature because it allowed you to adjust screen brightness with a single click    thus saving power  .
now , you have to go thru the long menu setup to adjust the e    savings overall , this is a excellent choice for an lcd panel  .
if you are not in a hurry , wait a couple months for prices to come down  .
i have seen prices go as low as $2 , 350 online (i  .
frys  .
i wish every channel is hd  .
it took me 2 day's to fine a set    up calibration that worked good in both sd hi    def i found a set    up on a avs forum on the internet which relly help me  .
up until that point the set is going back because of the poor picture , blurry on sd channels if you fine yourself with the same problem here is the site i found , http  //www  .
avsforum  .
com look in samsung lntxx61/65/66 calibration settings under the name ufo1922  .
his settings gave me a good starting point for my set    up super picture on hi    def better than sony or sharp 46 and i have no problem with the screen glare  .
i purchased this tv after researching both lcd and plasma hdtv's  .
i originally wanted a plasma but after i saw this and did my homework i quickly changed my mind  .
when i compared this to others i immediately noticed that it had deep blacks and a crystal clear picture that appeared better than even the best plasmas  .
i is impressed at the store and even more so when i got it home  .
then menus are intuitive , with a great number of adjustments  .
the sound is actually very good for an hdtv , most of which have weak 10w speakers  .
this tv seems to have more low end mostly because of the way the speakers are housed in the frame giving it better bass and volume  .
i returned 3 plasmas and then purchased this  .
i now have no buyers remorse which i did with the plasmas  .
the backlight is very even , no clouds or pillars and no dead pixles  .
sports and movies are both great  .
whites are white and blacks are black  .
no blurring or ghosting as with some  .
overall i am extremely satisfied and would reccomend this set to anyone who is looking for a new hdtv  .
some appear to have reported hdmi drop out issues and bright pillars on the side of the screen , however i have had none of these  .
see avs forums for more info  .
keep up the good work samsung .
like most of you i have done my research for years  .
when this tv came out and had great reviews and hdmi 1  .
3 , i decided it is time to buy  .
once i had my tv set up and watching high definition content , i is in heaven  .
i heard that the reflective screen is a problem , and i saw this in the store  .
however , at home , it tilts just right , and i do not have any problem with reflection  .
this is one solid , beautiful tv  .
i now own two samsungs  .
the other is a 32 inch hdtv .
i do not even subscribe to hdtv programing yet  .
sharpest picture i have ever seen  .
i even had to tone it down a bit for viewing  .
would have rated at a 10 , but nothing is that perfect  .
(makes one try harder)  .
this t  .
is amazing  .
i use mine mostly for xbox360 gaming , and i never imagined it would look soooooooo good  .
the glass is very , very clear , which makes images in hi    def seem almost as if you are there  .
these are absolutely the best black levels i've ever seen , and it has enough options for everyone to achieve their ideal picture  .
the craftsmanship is excellent  .
this is my second samsung hi    def set , and it further confirms my opinion of samsung as being the best for hi    def viewing  .
they sure know how to make a tv  .
thankyou  .
i've had an ln    t4066f since the first week it is out , i couldn't get over what a great picture the set displayed  .
now , after using the set pretty extensively over the last month i couldn't be much happier the image this tv produces will speak for itself , so i'm simply going to cover the negative points of the set raised by others  .
the pillars of light talked about in the review are only present with hdmi sources , and the set can be adjusted by the user to make them go away completely (black level adjust   set to low)  .
the glossy screen does take away one of the positives of lcd tech but it is not any worse than any tube tv and it is about as reflective as a plasma  .
i have the occasional drop over hdmi with my ps3 , about once every other gaming session , but hdmi drops are an issue with alot of hdmi sets and the ones on my 66f are not frequent  .
however , i'm hoping for a firmware upgrade to fix the hdmi issue the ln    txx65f and the ln    txx66f series lcd are identical aside from case styling  .
just in case you were wondering why someone with a 66f is commenting on the 65f board these sets are really great , but the lcd to have this year will probably be the 81f series samsungs being released this summer .
i is really debating whether or not i should keep this tv cause it does not have 120hz , but i soon found out the other lcd tv's that claim to have 120hz , is not even real 24/30fps compatible  .
anyway , this is a great tv , i have not had any hdmi drop outs or flashes and i play my ps3 for hours on end every day  .
i've had the sharp and sony and i can definatly say this tv is much much better  .
notice i didn't mention the glossy screen  .
after speaking to the regional trainer of samsung's a/v products for eastern canada (which if cnet had gone in depth and had spoken to a company representative they would have found out)the reflective screen is a direct result of being the best way to increase the over all black levels of the television  .
having the diffusing screen as most lcd's still produces grayish blacks  .
removing that diffusing screen allows the 65 series to produce those lovely blacks that the cnet reviewers seem to like so much  .
still compared to almost any plasma out there i have seen , the reflectiveness caused by ambient light is still considerably less  .
definatley a good buy  .
samsung is by far superior in this expert's opinion to even the sony xbr in colour and contrast  .
bravo samsung , you finally made a tv that dose not suck  .
i have owned this tv for about a month , and so far i am extremely satisfied  .
i is looking at the sony kdl    46xbr3 , but i found this tv online for almost a thousand dollars less than the sony at best buy  .
the background is uniform when reproducing deep blacks (a problem with the sony) , and the design is just as sleek as the sony model  .
i really have no complaints , other than it's difficult to watch when the shade on the window is open  .
the screen is glossy , which can be annoying at times , but it's livable if you own a set of blinds  .
i would highly recommend this tv to anyone who wants a moderate size lcd with great picture quality and is great at reproducing both primary colors and deep blacks .
i upgraded from a sony 40s2000 to this set and it's substantially better  .
my only concern is with the widely reported hdmi problems  .
i'm still using component for my hd so i have not confronted it yet  .
hopefully samsung will have this addressed by the time i'm ready to use hdmi .
i've search for months try to pick between a plasma or lcd  .
i finally went to sears just to look  .
i look at them all and this one did it for me  .
wow , great picture and sound  .
i look at sony along side and pick the sansung  .
sears game me a great price match from amazon plus 10% of the diffrence  .
i save 900 bucks .
a great tv for a great price , go for t  .

bye bye sharp , bye bye clouding and banding , ~  .
last friday , i purchased a ln    s4695d tv  .
i is very very happy with my purchase  .
so happy , that i researched on it some more  .
when i went back to the bestbuy site , i is dismayed to learn that 95d is no longer being sold  .
in fact , it is being replaced by a newer model       ln    t4665f  .
when i learned that the 65f had hdmi 1  .
3 a 15000  1 contrast ratio , i definitely had to return my old tv  .
please keep in mind that the 95d is already a kick    arse tv , but the 15000  1 ratio on the 65f really does make a difference  .
the rich blacks make the color more vibrant  .
i'm using my xbox 360 hd    dvd player to perform the visual benchmarking  .
king kong looks more spectular on the 65f rather than the 95d       and i did not think that's even possible  .
also , with the the 95d , i had to adjust the tv so that the 360 games would look bright , but with the 65f , it is perfect out    of    the    box  .
good luck with your future purchase guys .
by far my favorite tv i have ever owned  .
i looked a several models at several different locations and retail stores and ended up sticking with the samsung  .
i not disappointed at all  .
my friends all love the tv and i got them into buying samsung tvs  .
ive played xbox 360 , ps3 , and even watch blu ray on this tv  .
sports  .
wow  .
love watching my lakers and my ppv ufc fights in hd  .
cant say enough about this tv  .
has several connections too  .
if you need more then you have too many gadgets , haha i would buy this tv again although the price is slightly lower than what my brother paid for it , id like to see this tv for under $1999  .
im sure i can now , but at the time it is $2300+  .
still worth it though .
i hung this thing in my bedroom and have been happy with it since day one  .
the samsung lcd's have a nice display and definately a notch above the rest  .
the tv itself has plenty of picture adjustments that need to be tweaked out of the box  .
after these adjustments this lcd has minor faults most of which i can blame on the shiny screen  .
at night this tv is wonderful but during the day in my very bright bedroom it is reflective  .
that being said , the screen is superior to the other lcd's on the market right now if you can deal with this quality and darken the viewing room you have a great tv .
after few weeks i lost picture sound only remain it's happening to other people too samsung should recall this product and  .
replace bad components as soon as possible ,  .
before they get bad image i do not know if they care about this at all ,  .
because of bad service .
very impressed with samsung quality  .
looks better than friend's pioneer elite plasma .
my review is my attempt to capture the key points on the samsung 4665 hdtv , and how i went about selecting this product for purchase  .
i have organized my review by the following topics    .
research   the best source for research is cnet  .
com , which does a thorough review of the product and rates hdtvs on a scale of 1 to 10  .
both the 4661 and 4665 models fared very well , with the higher end models , namely the 4671 and 4681 scoring slightly higher  .
i also checked out consumer reports , which recommended the 4661 model (the non glossy sibling to the 4665 ; cr did not test the 4665 specifically)  .
further , i supplemented my research by reading product reviews on amazon  .
com  .
additionally , i visited several electronic stores to see the product with my own eyes plasma vs lcds   you may not want to hear it but when it comes solely to picture quality , plasmas offer a better picture quality than lcds  .
it is a plain fact  .
however , plasmas have their set of issues such as higher risk of burn    in , heavier weight , etc  .
if only the benefits of an lcd could be combined with the picture quality of plasmas  .
fortunately the 4665 does bridge that gap with its super clear gloss panel (see my full review below for details) samsung vs sony vs sharp   after deliberating which lcd brand to buy i settled on 3 brands noted for high picture quality  sony , sharp and samsung  .
sony is way too expensive and there are reports all over the net about clouding issues  .
sharps have dark blacks but their lcd line is plagued with banding issues  .
i have seen the banding for myself on their 62 series , although their newer 64 series supposedly has greatly reduced it , but unfortunately not eliminated it  .
thus , with sony and sharp out of consideration , samsung became the optimal choice where to buy and secure price protection   i purchased this set on dec 23 , 2007 and paid $1549 for the 4665 model which , at the time of purchase , is only a $75 mark up over the 4661 model  .
i went to several price comparison sites to ensure that i would get the best deal  .
amazon had the best price for the 4665 , hands down  .
with free shipping and no taxes , the price is too good to believe  .
further , amazon has a 30 day price protection guarantee so if the price on the amazon site drops within 30 days of purchasing the product , all you need to do is call their customer service department to get a price credit  .
if you do not wish to check the prices for the next 30 days there is an automatic way to be notified of a price change  .
just visit http  //www  .
priceprotectr  .
com/ and enter your e    mail and the relevant web address of the product on amazons web site  .
of course , to be eligible for price protection , you will have to buy through amazon and not one of its partners 4661 vs 4665   these two models are siblings  .
the 4661 has a matte finish whereas the 4665 has a super clear panel or gloss screen and a higher contrast ratio  .
the gloss finish is intended to bridge the gap in picture quality between lcds and plasmas  .
therefore , like plasmas , the 4665 will have some reflections but to me it is quite trivial compared to the richer colors you obtain from the 4665 compared to the 4661  .
also , i think cnet , in its review , overstated the effect of the gloss coating and thereby needlessly scares those who are considering choosing between the 4661 and 4665  .
to further my point on why the gloss coat is better , note that the high end samsung models , namely the 4671 and 4681 , both have a gloss coat , and have obtained excellent reviews at cnet and amazon  .
if samsung chooses to put a gloss coat on its best models , it surely means that samsung and its customers know that the coating is better than one without it  .
picture quality   the hdtv comes with three standard settings  vivid , standard and movie  .
the settings within these options , regrettably do not bring out the best in the hdtv and in many cases you may wonder why everyone rates this product so highly when the picture , right off the box , is not that great  .
the key is to change the settings , and fortunately you can do it yourself in less than 5 minutes by changing the settings to those recommended by audio/video calibration experts over at the avs forums  .
i used their recommended settings , and viola , the picture quality suddenly turned stunning  .
here is the web link for the expert calibration settings   http  //www  .
avsforum  .
com/avs    vb/showpost  .
php  .
p  11287410 postcount  1499  .
cables   the 4665 comes with a plethora of connections including 3 hdmi slots  .
i found that the best site to shop for cables is the highly    rated www  .
monoprice  .
com from where i purchased quality hdmi cables for approx $6  .
radio shack and best buy are charging over $60 for cables of similar quality  .
i also obtained a wall mount kit from monoprice for $20 extra 3 months warranty   in addition to the standard 1 year warranty , i is pleasantly surprised to note that you could get a free 3 month extended warranty directly from samsung just by registering the product with samsung  .
further , many credit card companies double the warranty of the manufacturers original warranty  .
so a standard one year warranty doubles to 2 years with most credit cards  .
it doesnt make any sense to buy extended warranties  even consumer reports agrees with that  .
in short , the 4665 is a great hdtv because it offers an excellent price to quality , value proposition .
a buddy of mine who worked at microsoft told me they lined up a huge amount of hdtv's to see what would work best with games  .
i is torn between this samsung and a panasonic plasma  .
i compared at best buy and would up going with this lcd  .
it's blown me totally away ever since  .
i wish the refresh rate is a bit better , so i would not see pixelation during football games , but for gaming i do not think this tv could be beat  .
i also hear the samsung has a newer model out that has a better refesh rate , so check that out  .
overall i'd give this tv a strong 8  .
5 , but i'm limited to 8 i guess .
this lcd has one of the best pictures for this type of technology  .
it is only a matter of time before tv manufacturers would follow suit with computer makers by utilizing glossy coverings on their lcd displays the diffusion of light with normal lcds can wash out the blacks in your picture  .
since contrast areas are well defined using the glossy coat , colors appear more saturated and sharper as well  .
i'm not sure if there is a higher    rated contrast ratio for lcd than the ln    t4665f ; 15 , 000  1  .
compare that with samsung's non    glossy 46 inch lcd , the ln    t4661 at 10 , 000  1 and you can see what affect the glossy coating has on your picture quality but then what of the reflective complaints we've heard so much of  .
i'm not sure what the real problem is  .
if you've ever sat in front of a larger tube    based tv , (who has not  .
) with some lights on in the room , you've experienced worse reflection problems than what the 4665 throws your way the hd programming that comes over the air from all the major networks is awesome compared to it's 'regular' counterpart  .
that aspect alone of this television being able to show me these 'hidden' versions of these stations that come over the air    fox , abc , nbc , cbs , pbs , cw is great the only downfall of the 4665 is the uneven brightness you can notice only occasionally  .
it appears brighter on the sides of the display than in the middle  .
not really a deal breaker since it's only noticeable in certain lighting situations with darker scenes showing in your program  .
the swivel stand is also a very nice touch that optimizes viewing angles .
i love this tv  .
initially put off by the reports of glare i'm happy to say that it's a non    issue  .
i have this tv set up in a 16x20 room with two , west    facing double windows , two single , south    facing windows , four skylights and french sliding doors  .
although i did see reflections in a sony 50 rear    projection analog set with matt screen that the samsung replaced there are none with this beautiful piece of technology .
we don't appreciate the glossy screen , however  .
we assume the company chose a reflective screen coating , as opposed to the matte screens found on most lcds , to attract attention in the store when the ln    t4665f is lined up next to the millions of other flat    panel sets  .
you    assume    that it's to attract attention  .
sorry cnet , i've said it before , and i'll say it again   try to learn what you're talking about before you publish it and claim expert status , would you  .
for years , lcd manufacturers have put a diffusion layer on lcd televisions in order to accomplish 2 things   create a matte finish , but more importantly , eliminate hot    spotting , in which one area of the screen is brighter or hotter than the other samsung found that by re    engineering their backlight designs , they could avoid hotspotting and remove the diffusion layer  .
what this did , is remove one more layer of material that would otherwise take away from the bright nature of lcd  .
and , it worked  .
notice how much brighter this samsung is compared to previous generations  .
so yes , the reflection is annoying       but cnet , it's not a freakin' reflective coating they added to it  .
why on earth would a tv manufacturer do such a thing  .
there's a trade    off for everything you know and no i do not own this set  .
but i do work for ken cranes home entertainment in ontario , ca and have to stare at the thing 12 hours a day and i've been to numerous samsung trainings so , i'm a mere salesman , and yet i know this       what's your excuse , cnet  .
i am a complete beginner with hdtv's  .
in fact , i'm a beginner when it comes to all tv's so this review might not be suited for all you smart tech guys out there  .
for the beginners , this is for you and maybe the pros can chime in with some advice i bought this samsung model based on cnet's reviews and the opinions of multiple on    line reviewers  .
i wanted the best and from what i researched , this is if not the best , one of the best lcd flat panels as soon as i received the set , i hooked up my standard verizon fios cable box into it using the standard cables and it looks like crap  .
i mean , the picture is worst then the tv i had before (10 year old toshiba)  .
the tv doesn't come with anything so i guess i'm stuck watching the bad reception until i get the proper cables  .
right  .
this is where i want the smart tech guys to chime in ; do i need an hd cable box and hd cables for this tv to look as fantastic as the reviews say  .
like i said , i'm a new hdtv owner so this review is for those like me i can say that the tv looks amazing on the stand and i do not have any problems with the screen glare .
i is wondering if anyone knows what the bit processing specs for this tv is  .
it appears to be a top notch piece of equipment  .
thanks ,  .
this lcd from samsung is another great product  .
tv is pretty easy to use and set up  .
auto sensing on inputs  .
great black    level detail  .
almost thought it is a plasma when i set it up on display  .
only have been able to test it on a blu    ray player , so i do not know how this handles standard    def broadcasting  .
but , i'm sure it does just as well as it's other series  .
why samsung had to use a glossy screen , i have no idea  .
i had a samsung rep tell me that this tv is only good for people who watch a lot of movies  .
the default picture setting (vivid) actually looks pretty good  .
also have not had the chance to test the anynet feature  .
overall , another awesome display of samsungs products .
helped my girlfriend buy the 29 version of this tv in korea last month  .
samsung really made some gorgeous tvs with this line  .
check this one out       you wo not be disappointed  .
it put every other screen in the shop to shame .
i owned the sharp lc    46d62u for 5 months before returning it to sharp because of horizontal bands  .
i loved the picture quality otherwise , but the non    uniform background is too much to deal with and all replacements sent by sharp had the same issue , along with the d92 series the sony xbr lcds , while loved by cnet , have myriad issues with mura    effects and crush blacks  .
so do the older samsung models the good news is that samsung has hit a home run with this new t series  .
the background is completely uniform with no bands or clouds  .
the black levels are as good as plasmas , with nice detail and no crush  .
the t series boasts 3 hdmi 1  .
3 inputs and lots of tweaks available from the main menu  .
the out of the box settings are horrid , so do not judge this tv by what you see in the store    in fact , the tv has a shop mode , which is scorchingly bright be aware that the 65 unit has the higher contrast ratio than the 61 , but has clear glass as opposed to a matte finish  .
this means that if you have a lot of ambient light in your room , you may want to consider the 61  .
the 65 has a decidedly plasma    like look to it due to its glossy panel and high contrast some early purchasers on avs did notice some very faint clouds , which disappeared after a few hours of use and did not come back  .
you will also want to set the hdmi black level to low compared to the sharp , i find motion handling on this set identical even though the sharp's spec says 4    6ms  .
one negative , albeit slight , is that the 4665f seems to be a bit fuzzier with respect to picture quality on 720p  .
i also do not like the brightness control  .
the scale is from 0    100 , with 50 being the default , which is just about near optimal    i have mine set at 45  .
if you go above 65 , you will notice how the left and right sides of the screen brighten much faster than the middle until you get to 100 , when the screen is uniformly bright  .
using the gamma control seems to work on the middle part of the screen  .
it's kind of odd why the brightness works this way but i seriously doubt anyone would want the brightness at even 60 , let alone above 65 all in all , it's a great lcd    probably the best on the market right now .
there has been an online grumbling lately regarding the fact that newer versions of this lcd have a different chip (cortez as opposed to the older trident) and that the picture quality is decreased from the original reviews  .
there has not been a re    review yet from a reputable source  .
if the tv is indeed of a different quality than before , then consumers should know  .
so , cnet , please revisit this lcd  .
good hdtv not to much expensive  .

i bought this set and then returned it in less then a month  .
everybody on avsforum and i kept getting hdmi drop out with ps3 and other devices i do not recommend this set for video games .
tv started making weird popping sounds , flashing , pinging and loosing signal randomly with sony ps3 1080p signal over hdmi (i tried different hdmi cables and even a friends ps3)  .
i had to run it at 1080i for some time while samsung tried to figure it out  .
eventually , then sent me a cd with new firmware  .
upon loading new firmware , the popping and pinging reduced to a great extent (still would occur but not as often)  .
however , after a year or so , i ordered hdtv programming and received a set top box that output 1080p  .
i had to connect this to hdmi 2 and the same problem i had with hdmi1 (with the ps3) repeated again on hdmi 2 port  .
i also noticed similar problems with the side hdmi port  .
apparently , whatever software they sent only fixed hdmi1 problems , and that too partially  .
when i called samsung for support , they treated this as a new issue and told me that since my warranty had expired , i had to give it for repair at a samsung repair center and pay for the repair  .
all this just 16 months after purchasing the tv for $2400  .
what a waste of money  .
samsung support has been terrible  .
i asked them if they could just send me the latest software or just the new circuit board and i would get it replaced myself and they did not oblige  .
i would sincerely suggest anyone buying samsung products to look elsewhere  .
if buying samsung is imperative , do get an extended warranty    which costs about $500 for 4 years  .
i personally have nothing against samsung (having owned their omnia and fridge also) but if they dont take good care of customers and maintain quality , i will not remain a customer for long  .
if someone from samsung is looking , email be at telveer@rediffmail  .
com if you want to help)  .
i am an avid video gamer  .
i also love to watch hd sports  .
i am not much of a dvd fan but i will watch the occasional movie or two  .
i have had a bad experiences with lcd panels in the past  .
i returned several sony xbr 2 and samsung models due to uneven backlighting (clouds)  .
this is hard because , if not for the backlighting issues , i would have been very happy with these tvs  .
they both offerred crisp pictures and great color  .
but the clouds absolutely destroyed dark scenes in tv , movies and video games  .
so , when i saw this new offering by samsung , i is very excited  .
i thought that it must have overcome the backlighting issues that plagued prior versions  .
and the early reviews were positive  .
users on avs said that backlighting looked uniform and even had the pictures to prove it  .
i ran out to my local cc and bought this tv sight unseen unfortunately , i is disappointed  .
as soon as i turned this tv on for the first time i noticed pronounced clouding in the corners and in the center  .
in fact , this panel had the worst backlighting issues i have ever had in an lcd  .
i let the tv run for several hours but the clouds did not go away nevertheless , this tv has one of the sharpest pictures and best color i have ever seen  .
it is so good , in fact , that i even considered living with the clouds and keeping the tv  .
but then i encountered another issue that made this unit impossible to keep  .
while i is playing my ps3 the tv would simply drop the signal  .
i could hear sound , but no picture  .
i would have to turn the tv off and back on again to fix the problem  .
this happend twice in the first 30 minutes i played the ps3  .
this is totally unacceptable for any tv    let alone a $3 , 000 top of the line model so , i returned this unit and went back to my pioneer plasma  .
i have also noticed that on avs the real picture about this tv is starting to take shape    a great tv with several fatal flaws  .
perhaps they can fix the hdmi signal issues with a firmware uprgade  .
but for now , if you want to use this set for gaming , the clouds and hdmi signal issues are just too much to overlook i am still waiting for the right lcd  .
if you find it , please let me know .
i bought this samsung ln    t4665f tv back in july 07 and just last week i went to turn it on and the black screen of death  .
i called samsung they referred me to a local repair shop for a waranteed main board replacement  .
i got it back today and when i turned the tv on i immediately noticed the picture is darker and alot less vivid  .
i tried every adjustment in the manual and could get no where near the way it was  .
i even went to best buy today and saw my tv displayed with a picture and the difference is noticable  .
the tv guy is coming tomorrow to see if the proper internal adjustments were made , if not he has another new main board to install , hope that works  .
its frustrating to spend almost 3k and have this happen .
this is the worst panel reflection i've ever seen on a plasma errrrr i mean lcd this would be fine in a dark room , but that's it  .
it's like a mirror in a family room sf  .
let's start from the beginning , first it can look great but i disagree , why  .
because with contrast ratio 15 , 000  1 you will say uauuu 1st) manufacturers often overstate contrast ratio number and it's a good idea to compare screens side    by    side with high contrast scenes 2nd) closely coupled to contrast ratio is brightness or black level  .
why  .
'cause brightness is the major determining factor in your ability to watch the screen in a lighted room  .
samsung ln    t4665f 46 1080p hdtv lcd tv brightness 500cd/m2  .
that's half my chinese brand hdtv has (1000cd/m2) 3rd) with response time 8ms , that's out    dated again , my chinese brand hdtv does response time 4ms (again twice faster  .
4th) tv scan lines hdtv    1080p is standard but not latest , again my old chinese brand hdtv already gives 1200p  .
5th) pixel resolution 1920 x 1080 is again standard however 1920 x 1200 is better  .
ok to say somethin' good about the hdtv , uhh let's say it's cheap for the rich  .
if you wonder how much i paid for mine 1k dollars  .
having had the opportunity to see this tv tested aside the top lcd brands , let me shed a little insight at first it gets your attention because of the holy crap bright picture , but then when you actually start to look at the picture from the default settings (because over 90% of users leave their tv in the default picture settings mode going into the service menu of any tv voids the warranty right , mr  .
katzmier  .
) you notice that the image is over driven and loses detail in the bright areas and lacks (yes i said lacks ) sharpness with a strong 1080p signal like blu    ray or hd    dvd compared to other lcd tv's their new lcd shiny screen is part of a bigger cost reduction process to build a cheaper tv yet still charge top dollar the new cost reduced panel increases the light output considerably , but requires the additional shiny lcd cover screen which is absolutely necessary to produce contrast on this set  .
this is like the old projection tv's used to have to make a dark , contrasty picture when they wanted to cheapen up the electronics in the set  .
if this lcd tv did not have this screen , it would be like watching your current tv with the brightness at 100  .
so if you decide to get it get used to watching tv completely in the dark or enjoy watching all the lights in your room glare back at you and heaven forbid if you have children and this screen gets scratched get ready to stare at that white (yes , white) gouge on the screen  .
this is an other characteristic of this type of contrast screen suseptible to damage  .
i had a pc monitor with shiney screen and that's how i know current reports from the field are also stating that the stand on these new sets have a design flaw they break extremely easy when any type of irregular pressure is put on them like taking out of the box  .
it is also being reported that the coaxial cables on these sets are extremely sensative to tension like connecting a coax cable and they break off just reporting what i hear 1080p/30hz (or 1080p at 30 frames per second) is a future signal to consider having your tv support  .
you see , this signal takes up the same bandwidth or amount of room on a cable wire as 1080i/60 which is the standard most of us watch today (hd watchers that is)  .
1080p/30 is the leading format that the broadcasters are actually considering as the new progressive picture broadcast standard for future tv (cable satellite) signals and this set along with the new sharp , and probably the new sony (because samsung and sony use the same internal processing circuitry by a company called trident) a host of others do not support it so you spend all that money and out of the box you set is not compatible with the most watched signal you will put to it i hate buying obsolete things oh also with samsung's new unilateral pricing policy , it will also make it nearly impossible to get a deal on their new sets , too  .
that's what we need another company who thinks they are sony  .
in this review i'll review not only the samsung hdtv but also other components for a complete entertainment system when it comes to hdtv , my requirements are very high compared to most i use it to play bluray  .
i use it as a pc monitor , i use it with hd cable  .
i also use it as a stereo  .
i use it as a ps3 monitor i spent several days at circuit city and several days on line reading specs and reviews the samsung 4665f is a great choice  .
earlier lcd tvs included a mitsubishi , sony and several samsungs avoid dell  .
1 out of 10 dell hdtvs are defective as of 2007 mitsubish is made outside of japan and it showed , the unit is defective out of the box  .
some sonys where the same as samsung , because samsung made some of the lcd panels for sony's high end hdtvs , but samsung had more features the picture quality , brightness , and refresh rate where all very good  .
mulitple resolutions with the pc also were very good  .
contrast is very good  .
it is the best choice at the time of purchase none of the hdtvs where good in sound buying a separate amp and speakers is a must for high def sound my huge lcd tv is in my bedroom , where i get the full theatre effects  .
i rarely ever go to the movies anymore when i play online with my ps3 i almost always come out as top player  .
simply because i can see every pixel , even in the darker shaded areas  .
so i can snipe a enemy far away with only his elbow showing under a car  .
something not possible with a tiny normal tv with standard definition i also can beat people who bought those cheap no name brand hdtvs from walmart/target  .
why  .
because those cheap no name brands have terrible contrast  .
any enemy hiding in a shadow is invisible on those cheap tvs as for sound , none of the tvs had good sound  .
but there is a excellent solution on the market i learned accidently that dvd and bluray contain high def sound , much finer resolution then a cd disc  .
i discovered this when i plugged in my studio monitors (high end monitors used in music studios) into my bluray player both me and my pets kept on looking at the door , or across the room for intruders , because we kept hearing sounds  .
i kept on saying , swear i heard someone after a few days of saying this i realized i only heard people and sounds when i is watching a dvd or bluray i had plugged in my studio monitors into my bluray player simply because it is convenient at the time , (monitors are smaller then most home speakers) not knowing it would make a difference  .
boy did it make a difference  .
i gave away all my new bose speakers after that experience  .
and used my yamaha studio monitors for my dvd/bluray the sound is literally undistinguishable from real sound  .
with my bose speakers it is obvious that the sound is coming from my speakers  .
with professional yamaha studio monitors it is undisthinguisable from real sound  .
is it more expensive then home speakers  .
yes , each monitor speaker costs about $500  .
so two would cost $1000 and 5 speakers for surround sound would cost $2500 so now my entertainment system is perfect  .
a huge samsung lcd hdtv , yamaha professional studio monitors and a ps3 as a dvd bluray player why did i give it a 4 instead of a 10  .
simple the remote is one reason , i have 5 inputs going into the tv , so if i want any one input , i might have to go through the other available inputs , this could take time  .
there is no random/direct access  .
sonys do not have this either (accept one model)  .
not a big deal but a pain for someone who switches inputs a lot another reason is that none of the tvs have good speakers built into them  .
for me it worked out fine because i already had the yamaha monitors (as opposed to home speakers)  .
studio monitors can be purchased from music stores such as sam ash  .
i went through many monitors which were all highly recommended by the sales people which i is unhappy with  .
for some reason they avoided recommended the yamaha , though this is the most commonly used monitors in recording studios  .
my last set of monitors i decided on the yamahas and it is the best choice i made , despite it never being recommended by a sales person  .
it is however recommeded by a music studio itself which were using them .
i got this lcd very recently and i play video games and watch lots of movies  .
when i got the tv the first thing i did is turn on my ps3 and hook it up  .
the picture of the game is very poor  .
i then turned to some hd channels , they were very nice  .
i'm not sure what the shiny gloss every one is talking about , but i do know that this tv is not made for games  .
i left the tv for a month when going on a trip to germany  .
when i came back all my channels had been disconected and lost  .
they told me to call a number to retrieve these channals  .
once i called i got the worst custimer servise ever  .
samsung ripped me off  .
i like the picture , but in less that a year a pixel locked to red (very noticable) and samsung will not address the issue after two service calls , 5 calls , and 6 e    mails  .
apparently samsung considers a bad pixel as within spec  .
if i had to do it over again , i would go with panasonic or sony .
how can the telly be given a 8  .
3 score when it has been mentioned that the sd performance is mediocre  .
most of the top tier hdtvs perform well with hd and sd should be a major key area in rating  .
request the reviewer to re    comment on sd performance .
customer service designed to frustrate you , product that does not work  .
do yourself a favor and avoid samsung  .
owned for two years , although used for 13 months  .
samsung did replace a failed power module as a courtesy  .
one month later the lcd screen apparently needs to be replaced , now that it only provides a very nice blank and black screen  .
net result   unit has cost $1800  .
00 for thirteen months of operation , plus whatever the cost will be to replace lcd screen  .
shame on samsung service representatives for not helping with the cost burden to a senior on social security only  .
guess it's back to sony or panasonic , which never failed me in the past .
if you buy this tv , plan on paying to have it repaired when the tv starts turning on and off (and wo not turn on) .
after only two years the panel got vertical lines all over it  .
the repair service samsung recommended said it would cost over 1200 dollars to fix it  .
i could buy a new one cheaper than that  .
i am very dissapointed with this tv , i used to like samsung until this happened .
based on the unreliablilty of this tv and the abysmal service response i would not recommend  .
i will never buy a samsung product again and plan to tell anyone who asks about my experience with them .
tv is good while it lasted  .
i understand defects can occur but due to samsung's lack of service i would never buy another samsung product again .
i bought my tv new in july 2007 and is very happy with the unit until a month and a half later when the picture went out  .
after a couple of dozen calls and a couple of trips by the repair company contracted by samsung to fix the problem , it's now november and tv still doesn't work i wo not buy another set from samsung .
i bought a samsung 4665 lcd tv after reading many reviews , stating how nice the picture is and i is really disapointed  .
i brought the tv back to the store after a week of owning it the biggist problem with this tv is the picture you get from standard definition there is so much jitter or you can call it picture noise , also there is lots of lag witch creates a very disapointing picture i would consider myself someone who can really see's the difference in picture quality , but on the other hand my wife does not know much about tv's and the first thing she said when she saw the picture on sd , was your taking this thing back to the store i did more research for another week or so and decided that i was not going to buy lcd again so i went for the panasonic 50px77u and i is blown away by the picture quality and so is my wife with the samsung lcd the blacks would get washed away the second that you move away from the center of the tv , and the level of black wasn''t even close the panasonic tv resembles alot more by projector cinema room witch is awesome now that i have first hand experiance with lcd vs plasma  .
i get a completely differnt sale pitch when i walk into televion stores  .
after speaking with the saleman they always end up telling me that they all have plasmas and that lcd's really suck sorry for pissing off a few of you , but i had to give back to the comunity witch helped me buy a tv that im really amazed with thanks for all your reviews  .
serge montreal , quebec  .
overall picture quality is poor  .
white ant    like flickers along the entire top (discovery hd , espn hd , tnt hd etc) , vertical lines on both sides that were easily visible  .
i would rate it lower , but samsung is usually a good product , but not this model .
the video via the hdmi port is intermittant the picture will go black and the only way to restore the hdmi video is to power    fail the tv (o the video will go out again in a few min  .
's) samsung ack  .
's the issue  .
they say the issue is a software problem which they have a upgrade for  .
but the service deepartment has tried to upgrade the software twice and have failed both times to upgrade their software  .
samsung is not very responsive and had to argue with the phone rep to escalate the problem  .
samsung makes it impossable to speak to anyone except their entry level phone rep's , who run the play directly from the play book  .
poor customer service , it apears they really do not care  .
or they would of escalted this issue  .
buyer beware on a posative note , when the tv does work , it's really a very good quailty picture .
product is great until it broke due to a very common problem that samsung won't acknowledge  .
my next tv wo not be a samsung  .
i have had my $2000 lnt4665f samsung television for 20 months (8 months past my warranty)  .
until this week i is extremely satisfied with my selection  .
then it started making a clicking noise when i power it on  .
the tv eventually comes on but each time i turn it on it takes longer to power up and display a picture  .
there is no doubt that it will eventually not work at all i have searched this issue on the internet and much to my dismay have found countless forums and threads from dissatisfied customers who have experienced the exact same issue  .
every one of these people are obviously displeased with their tv , but they are even more angry with samsung's careless attitude toward resolving an obvious defect in the design of their product  .
i work in the electronics industry and i know the importance of reliability testing  .
i is outraged to discover that this particular problem is prevalent long before my tv is ever made , lending even more proof that samsung will not lift a finger to rectify the issue and salvage it's reputation  .
if you plan on buying a new hdtv every 18 months or so this is the tv of for you  .
i for one , cannot afford to do that .
the tv would be awesome if it worked  .
the picture keeps going out  .
checked online to see if this is a common problem , guess what  .
it is  .
do not buy any , i mean , any samsung tvs .
although i have no doubt that the ln    t4655f that cnet and other sites reviewed is an excellent tv , the newer models being shipped on amazon and other online sites are a new 8 bit crappy processor called the cortez  .
check out avs forum  .
com look under 1016/1007 and read all about samsung's bait and switch that is going on with these tv's  .
i had a 32 olevia that looked 10 times better than the samsung with my ps3 (hdmi) and xbox360 (component) so i know its not the source material  .
my blu ray movies are grainy and it really makes me angry that i paid so much for this tv expecting so much and now im stuck with a picture that is mediocre at best  .
did i mention the the picture is grainy and horrible  .
my suggestion would be if you want to buy this television be ready to be disappointed as i was  .

tv worked for a week now just a black screen with sound  .
it has been 2 months before they found out what is wrong and will not replace it  .
terrible customer service and they say it is going to take another month to get the part regina area so repair shop is partly to blame for the speed but when you pay this much for a tv you expect a replacement if something goes wrong after only 1 week  .
frustrated  .
a little over a month after purchasing this product , a thin black line appeared on the screen  .
samsung came out and replaced the panel instead of giving me a new t  .
then there is a dead pixel about one week later  .
minor problem , but once again , they replaced the panel instead of the entire t  .
this time they left me with a t  .
that had half of the screen in black and the other half that looked like broken glass  .
completely unwatchable  .
they would not leave my previous panel that could at least be watched  .
now i am left without a t  .
i am having people over for a college football watching party and samsung will not return my old panel or guarantee that i get a new panel  .
essentially , i am left with no t  .
for an indefinite period of time  .
their explanation is that they did not want to pay the service tech  .
to come back  .
the service tech  .
, of course , did not want to come back because he would not get paid  .
that , my friends , it what you call horrendous customer service  .
it is also a poor product as evidenced by the continual need for repair .
