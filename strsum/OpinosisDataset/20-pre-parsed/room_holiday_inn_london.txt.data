rooms were well insulated from outside noise .

if i had paid more than $100 for my room, i would have been disappointed .

both rooms were kept very clean during our extended visit .

rooms were cleaned every day without fail and toiletries and coffee sachets etc replenished .

tiny room, dated furniture, the dirt from my shoes wasn't removed by the cleaners during my stay .

even standard staterooms aboard cruise ships were the same size or larger !

rooms are fairly small, but you have to expect this outside of north america .

my bathroom was, like the room, small .

bathroom was smaller than u .

our rooms were not ready, we were promised rooms at a later time, etc .

bathroom is a bit small but acceptable .

room was clean, comfortable, modern .

usualy i still smell smoke from somewhere , even on the non, smoking rooms, not this time .

rooms are clean and good size by english standards .

the bathroom is small, but well equipped .

this is a great hotel, nice rooms, not too big but this is not a problem .

bathroom was nice with good shower .

shabby rooms basic facilties ,  no way is this a four star hotel .

room rate including continental breakfast was very competitive .

room size is fine and bathroom is good .
