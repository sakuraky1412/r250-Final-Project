all in all, a normal chain hotel on a nice location  , i will be back if i do not find anthing closer to picadilly for a better price .

great price terrific location .

our main focus before booking was looking for a low price with good location .

 all for the bargain price off £ 250 for 2 nights including return rail to north wales .

explore the area and you will find plenty of pubs where you can eat for a reasonable price .

 half expected a noisy room by the elevator for the bargain price we paid, but instead got a 17th floor room with awesome city view .

 the price we paid for our rooms was reasonable .

i got this hotel on price line for a 4 night stay with my boyfriend for our anniversary, for about £80 a night inc taxes, however after reading reviews about this hotel i was very worried about staying here .

 breakfast is ok, but not worth paying for if it's not included in your room price .

 if you're looking for a clean place to rest your head at a decent price and want flexibility to check in or out as you please, this is a good place for you .

all in all, it was a decent hotel, but i think i may try somewhere else next time purely just to see what else is available at the same kind of price .

 we ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was overprice for the quality of food .

 for the price and location, this was a very great hotel .

 price was unbeatable, just 79 pounds night .

 we got this for $75 a night, which is a lot cheaper than any listed price we could find .

our breakfasts and one dinner meal were included in our price .

 one day late and i paid the same price for a better room in hi kensington, the supposedly better classed hi nearby   .

 if you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .

\the staff is very friendlyi had found a really nice price and for this money this hotel was incredible .

 for the price and the location i thought this place was great .

 good pub nearby   with wonderful breakfasts and meals at a good price .

 as previous reviewers have said, there's a variety of shops nearby   and breakfast of a better quality and price can be bought there .

 and fully intend to come back again ,  if the price is right .

i booked this one as none of my favourites were available and i was amazed at the lowish price offered .

very happy with the hotel for the price .

 overall for the price i think it was extremely good value .

the biggest disappointment was the price of internet .

 however, if you are looking for a comprehensive hotel experience, i'm sure there are plenty of better hotels available for the same price in the city .

 but there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .

great hotel for a great price .

i used priceline' name your own price and my bid of a $100 night was exepted for a sunday and a monday night .

good hotel for the price nice location .

 it's nicer than certain other hotels you'd get in the same price range on priceline and all in all was nice .

 i wouldn't say it stands out particularly, but if you're looking for a reliable, convenient, comfortable place in london, this is a great place to stay , ,  especially if you can get it at a good price on priceline or another site like that .

 nothing that spectacular to justify the price .

it's an okay hotel, and i don't mind staying there again if i get it for a cheap price through priceline .

restaurant ,  make sure to try thai and singapore restaurants ,  delicious and good price .

 but again, the location could justify charging that price .

 thought that we would be looked after given its rating and the price paid .

 the price was exceptional for the kensington area, and as many reviewers have mentioned, it is a two or three minute walk to the gloucester tube station .

 all, in, all this hotel was a great choice for the price and location .

i booked this hotel via holiday inn ,2 nights for the price off 1  .

good price   location but no thrills .

 got decent price on hotwire as well .

 overall, for the price  , it is a pretty good deal .

 good price through expediahotel in general is in good shapetips :

 i would not stay at this holiday inn again unless the price was halved, because there are simply too many places offering better value in london .

 breakfast was appalling, plenty of it, you certainly won’t starve, but the quality was awful considering the price paid .

 i was shown an executive room if i wanted to upgrade, for the price of 35 pounds a night .

all in all a pleasant stay for a good price .

 although the menu is limited it was very good and a reasonable price .

 in particular, there was a nice indian run coffee breakfast restaurant across the street from the tube stop on gloucester road that served a good english breakfast at a decent price .

 would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price i got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the touristy sites in london .

 staff very friendly and i always worry when booking through priceline that i will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the london eye .

 just make sure you eat as much as you can for the price you have paid .

 i would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .

 however, the first price that they charged me was too much so i had to get a refund then be charged the correct amount for a standard room .

 ,  smallish roomsold style bar pubno ventilation on a smoking floorit's not worth the hotel web, site price of £160 for std room .

in short it's a good hotel if you get the price off lastminute .

com   and not the hotel web, site price of £160 .

we've stayed in london a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .

another word of warning when booking through the holiday inn website ,  vat was not included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many london hotels which i'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying £17 more per night than i'd expected .

despite the above problems i would recommend a stay here, price dependant .

bought the room for about 1 2 price using hotwire .

 don't buy the bottled water from the hotel ,  go to the supermarket and get it for half the price !

 however, a continental breakfast was included in the price and had a fairly large selection .

 we could not have been happier with the location or the room for the price .

 the bathroom is tiny but at least there is a bathroom attached to the room  in a lot of hotels that i looked at online in the same price range, bathrooms were not en suite .

 i would stay here again if the price was right .

the only reason to choose this hotel is its location, for other aspects, not up to standard for its price .

 in sum, we wouldn't pay rack rate for this hotel, but at a reduced price it's an efficient, functional place to stay in london .

 i would not pay rack rate for a room here, but it is quite attractive at a discounted price .

00 which is an affordable price for a hotel in the posh area of kensington .

 hotel was clean, convenient to tubes, internet cafes, and local dining of all price ranges and styles .

 also got a good price for the room thro priceline about 47 pounds per night, hotel very clean and well run .

all in all i would recommend and would stay again if the price was right !

 i had prepaid for the room on hotwire good price at $120 .

 if you are just looking for basic lodging at a good price in london,  this is the place .

 although in some ways i would have preferred a smaller, more authentic english hotel, we really couldn't beat the combination of price and location   .

 if you're from the us, think 2, 3x the average price when you convert to us dollars .

would recommend the holiday inn kensington forum for location, price  , and cleanliness .

 location is great, hotel is wonderful, and price is right, it really is hard to beat right now .

our amazing deal from priceline did not include breakfast, but there were many places in the neighborhood to grab breakfast for a reasonable price before heading out for the day .

stayed between xmas and new years and the room, location, etc were what to expect for the price i paid .

 my friend and i had one pancakes and syrup, two orange juices, one tea, and one smoked salmon and scrambled egg with english muffin for £8   in total ,  the same price as one discounted breakfast at the hotel !

 so often i have booked a hotel at a price only to be disappointed with my choice on arrival .

 hotel but would stay again if the price was right due to the excellent location .

 the bags were located in the closet, but no price list .

 i could have bought a new pair of jeans for that price .

all in all it was just what we expected based on the price and would stay here again .

stay here ,  you won't regret it,  great price ,  great location .

 the shower pressure was a bit low but that's the price you pay for the top floor and it was well worth it  ,  instead of minibar there was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, i doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we had expected from our room .

  the only downsize of this hotel i see in the cost of breakfast, with price of more than £15 for full english breakfast or £10 if booked in advance .

our hotwire price did not include breakfast, but several restaurants were nearby, and the hotel had a reasonable coffee crossaint deal .

 reserved this hotel through hotwire and got a price of $90 night .

 that's a good price even though the room was tiny, however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast .

good if you don't pay retail price .

overall, this hotel is okay if you're on a budget or get a good deal through a discount site, but definitely not worth paying retail price for .

 good hotel for the price and location .

 great location and can't beat the price and the comfort !

good price great location would definately stay there again !

 anyway it may not have the charm or history of other hotels in london, but for the price location we would   visit again .

 we didn't eat at the hotel ,  there were some great cafe's just around the block with great food at a much better price .

 i would definately recommed this hotel to anyone as it is unbeatable for price and location in london .

 it was a bargain price for the hotel and it was great  .

for a similarly good location  , you can stay at the london hilton metropole for the same price and receive much better service .

 the room was small, the beds were hard, but a great value for the price we paid .

 great location and bargain internet price !

 there is little difference in the price and when we return to london in three weeks i have booked the millennium in preference to the forum .

 although this was about the same price as the local bars etc .

all in all i would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a pleasant stay in london, in a nice area, at a good price !

we have just stayed in the kensington forum and have to say that it is the best hotel we have stayed in in london for the price .

our one night stay was arranged by the cruise line so i can't comment on the price .

 a very good value for the price .

 overall an above average hotel based on location and price   but not one for a romantic get, away !

got this at a great price via priceline and at first was worried about holiday inn,  as usually don't care too much for this chain in the u .

 considering the horrible exchange rate gbp usd at the time we were in london, i believe the price was fair .

 i’m pretty sure the driver took the most direct route from the hotel, so not sure why the difference in price .

we stayed 5 nights in a room whose price was second lowest .

excellent location service cleanliness and price at the holiday inn kensington forum .

 even though this price doesn't include breakfast it was still a great value .

 the kensington forum is about as close to an american style hotel as one can reasonably hope to find in london at a reasonable price .

 the continental breakfast which was included in the price was very nice and served in the dining room, a pleasant time before dashing off around the city .

 you could not beat the location or the price .

 the price is moderate for the service and the location .

 the price was a real bargain as the published price at the hotel was 210 pounds  !

 the quality was very good and the price was reasonable .

excellent hotel excellent price .

 can't beat the price of $75 per night through priceline .

 one of the better places i've stayed in london for the price .

 hard to find better at this price .

00 pounds, hotel guests get it at the amazing price of 15 .

 for that price you get a glass of champagne, half a lobster and a wonderful hot and cold buffet .

price and location can't be beat .

 the price for triple cost me 76 pounds at the height of the tourist season .

 the price was right, and we were even told by an english tour guide that we had gotten a very good deal .

 continental breakfast was included in the price of our room package that we purchased through northwest airlines, but the breakfast room on the second floor was a bit of a feeding trough .

best location and unbeatable price !

 we had terrific price per room and seems hard to beat .

 there is a great supermarket and some restaurants pubs ,  we ate one night at  ask , which is a small chain of reasonable price .

 this is definitely a modern hotel, no english charm here, but the location and the price can't be beat .

after initial angst of getting a room, after a ny, london flight, i settled for a twin and not a double bedded room, 17th floor , small but very comfortable room, windows do open, bathroom new , staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !

great room fabulous price wonderful location !
