 keep in mind that once you get in a room full of light or step outdoors screen reflections could become annoying .

 i've used mine outside on a sunny day, and the screen is still very much legible .

 in fact it was much more detailed than the matte screen on my dell d600 .

 some ppl may prefer a higher resolution screen but i don't think it's required .

 i delayed ordering the computer because of the horror stories of bad batteries, faulty chargers and blue screen crashes .

1 inch screens, windows xp operating systems, a plethora of usb ports, a card reader, wifi and most have a few color choices .

1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several toolbars have been turned on .

 some of the asus special on screen controls, update and expand features built into the machine have not been all that useful and some border on being advertisements for buying asus stuff .

 two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the led backlighting for the screen .

 the ways the screen opens   enables a smaller footprint when the case is closed, although it limits how far back the screen will tilt .

 surfing the net is a breeze, but i did have one  blue screen of death  when dealing with one demanding internet site .

 the light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .

 i recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .

 zoom in or zoom out of a screen  , but on occasion it will zoom when you don't want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .

 the occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away  microsoft attributes it to an errant driver, but i have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .

the screen is not as bright as my acer .

 there are 2 bios updates and the latest is for a brighter screen setting .

 this makes the screen much brighter and as with all new computers it seems there are always important updates .

also if you install firefox web browser and push the f11 key the browser becomes full screen, helpful on a small screen .

 i got used to the glossy screens a while ago  this one is remarkably bright and vivid .

 now i keep getting the  blue screen  serious errors .

 wrote  it has crashed unexpectedly and displayed the blue screen of death numerous times .

 sometimes the blue screen of death appears for no discernible reason .

i began by considering netbooks with screens smaller than the now, standard 10 .

 if money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .

 but with screen brightness cranked up, bluetooth & wi, fi in constant use, some video playback  , and internet radio running, i'm getting a good 8

 with wi, fi off & the screen dimmed, i don't think i'll have a problem getting the stated 10 .

 the keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as i'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the u .

 has an 11  screen with the same or better battery life, .

 it's small with a very clear screen .

 i've had the 1005ha, pu1x for a week now ,  on and running applications continuously ,  without a single crash, blue screen, or hangup .

 the touchpad feels great, the boot up was fast, keyboard feels comfortable, and the screen is good .

 my only complaint with it is that the screen doesn't go back far enough .

 the touchpad works well, the screen glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .

 on full screen display is smooth and no issues .

 some itunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .

 and with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .

 it won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, i'll take the latter .

 on a full charge, with wireless on, screen brightness on medium, i get a reported 8 .

5 hours with no wireless, and screen brightness on minimum .

5 pass ,  screen is bright and large enough .

 once i configured firefox to always run full screen mode  , surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate .

 all features worked excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .

heavy rearward weight bias so much that it wants to fall backwards  with the screen pushed back all the way

 the screen is stunning, and if you've got a bright light shining down on it, you've got a choice :

 you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .

 i'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .

one of the other complaints i'd come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .

yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .

 and if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .

and i could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .

 except for difficulties seeing the entire new york times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old ibm laptop .

 i was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .

 also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the dvd .

 i like the gloss screen fine .

 the screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps do work .

 again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .

 like others have said, it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .

i received my asus 1005ha yesterday installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .

the screen is small, only 1024 x 600 .

i can hear the windows but my screen is totally blank .

 i can tell the backlight is on, but all i get is a black screen .

 i don't even see the bios screen on startup .

 the screen is sharp and bright .

 the screen is clear and easily viewed in indoor environments .

 with the view maximized, the screen is large enough to work on documents and read online research materials .

 the fashionable glossiness of both body and screen acquires fingerprints and smears rapidly .

 the shiny screen is reflective, which can be a problem if you have your back to a sunny window or work outdoors .

 i keep the screen brightness set at about half and easily get more than eight hours with wi, fi on .

 i don't know what the other reviewers are talking about as far as the screen brightness goes because my screen is far too bright at the higher end of the spectrum .

 it is a fingerprint magnet, and because of the glossy screen, its very reflective of light .

,  don't know why they use the screen size most do ,  1024 x 600 seems cramped

 takes sometime to get use to the small screen .

 yeah, the new led screen technology is that good .

the screen resolution isn't the highest you can get but i found that the higher resolution netbooks usually had older prcessors for some reason .

 i'm happy with the screen and resolution choices available .

 i usually run ie8 in full screen mode   with a 95% zoom setting and a 1024x600 resolution .

surprisingly readable screen for the size .

 4 do not get wax on your screen .

 hit f11 and you have full screen browsing ,  just move the cursor to the top of the screen for the controls .

the screen really is too small ,  1024x600 is barely livable .

with the battery in the back the computer has most of its weight in the back so the computer easily tips back when the screen is opened all the way up .

screen brightness is very satisfactory .

 asus docking is a program to have a quick menu on top of your screen to access all asus software .

the screen is easy to read in outside lighting conditions .

 my other hp laptop has a mat screen surface and is almost impossible to read outside .

 long battery life, sharp looking machine, fingerprint magnet,glossy screen=glare,ease of use and portability .

 the most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .

 the cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .

 the battery life is excellent, with normal usage i can get about 7 hours easily, more if i turn off wifi and turn down the screen brightness .

one of the downside i have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .

 screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .

 i also needed web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .

the screen size works just fine for me .

 having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but i have to admit having never needing to use it   .

 and it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .

, i'm still getting used to the small screen .

tiny screen compromises the experience of web surfing

 i'll see the first black screen, it appears to be starting, and then stays with either a grey or black screen .

3 sometimes the screen will all of a sudden distort and i have to re, start to get it to work .

 1 keyboard still floats  2the screen goes to a solid blue screen either right after starting or after it sits a while .

 great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .

 very nice, in fact, though i strongly dislike glossy screens ,  no matter, i knew it would have one when i ordered it .

the battery life has been very good, especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and bluetooth, and turning down the screen brightness .

9  screens, but felt that was too much of a sacrifice .

 the screen is small but still large enough to read comfortably   .

0 out of 5 stars bad lcd screen, october 7, 2009

 i fired it up and out of the box it has a vertical red line on the lcd screen .

just a big dark, screen paperweight .

 the netbook is light and sturdy, and it the screen looks great .

 only 10, inch screen, small keyboard and no cd, rom .

my advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .

 decent speed processor, nice screen quality, great asus softwares  , and very long battery life .

 pretty decent screen quality .

 although the screen is relatively small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .

one of the things that i found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .

 10  can be enough for some, but it was kinda small for me, so the thing i did was try to max out the screens by removing unnecessary menus .

when using internet explorer or firefox, press f11 and the screen will enlarge, giving you some additional freedom and space .

 glossy screens are the stupidest invention of this millenium .

 seeing reflections on the screen is just plain annoying .

 as new netbooks come out, look for the ones with matt screen and see if it has a good feature set and price .

 the screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .

 with 1gb of ram, it really isn't too bad to try to run photoshop or something either  , but the screen would be too small for something like that anyhow .

the battery life is unbelievable, even while using usb to transfer files, watching movies and surfing the internet with screen brightness all the way up .

factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .

 the 1024x600 screen can be set, if you wish, so that it is a 1024x600 viewport to a larger 1024x768 desktop, reachable by moving the mouse to the screen edge .

 this is useful if you have an application that demands a 1024x768 screen .

 screen appearance is enhanced by asus software, and i do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations .

 the 10 inch screen started getting to me on the asus 1005 .

i love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad .

 the mouse pad is very sensitive so i sometimes find myself on a different part of the screen if i accidentally touch something .

 the screen is comfortable and sufficently bright for occassional use .

 the screen is crisp and clear, and the unit runs great .

 the greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution .

 yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .

 i have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .

 streaming videos from hulu and netflix look incredible on this 10 inch screen .

the only minor issue that i have with 1005ha is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .

 the screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop .

 due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .

 the screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .

 the 10, inch screen is bright and has good color, and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .

 performance is good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous usb ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .

 it boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .

 but even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, i still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if i were on the market for a netbook .

 now the screen is cracked with big black blotches as well .

blue screen crashed several times .

hard to see full web pages on small screen, resolution inadequate .

 instead i convert dvds to dvix avi files using fair use wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .

 the screen resolution can be a little small at times, but that is a sacrifice i was willing to make .

 yes it does take some getting use to a smaller screen, the key board actually works better than my laptop though  .

i was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything i run :

 most of my professors teach from power points, and it makes my life so much simpler having the ppt on my screen that i can annotate while listening to the lecture .

 i have not accidentally knocked it over, but i think it could easily be done  the screen is glossy   .

 purchased this machine to enjoy the convenience of windows and the larger screen .

 years old, so the screen size was also a concern, but it is adequate for the type of things i use it for .

 as soon as you connect the vga cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .

 the keyboard is great and the screen looks good .

 it's also a shame that this model comes with a glossy screen .

 i personally haven't had a problem with the screen, but it would be fairly unusable outdoors in the sun .

for this extra amount, i was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .

 i have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .

this machine is plenty fast, it's just that if i try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .

you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .

the small screen is probably the biggest drawback .

 could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen it flattens it to make more visible .

 browsing is amazingly better by using full screen mode on browser with f11 .

 that extra space the menu and address bar take up are sorely needed on this small screen .

 in full screen browsing it is so much better that i would never go back .

 because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .

one hint ,  there's a setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .

 i mostly find that when i make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , i just can't see what i'm doing as well as a laptop .

as others have noted, i wish the screen wasn't so reflective .

 and maybe it's something i need to figure out how to fix, but i don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .

 has all the features of my bigger laptop except a large screen .

1 inch screen is bigger than the 8 .

 i want a netbook for portability, not screen real estate .

, i was willing to downsize my screen size in favor of portability and speed .
