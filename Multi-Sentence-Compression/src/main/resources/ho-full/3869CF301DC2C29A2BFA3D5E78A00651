we spent two days here as part of our cycling tour .
it was very spoeical as this may be the last time we travel abroad and as it was the end of the tour we were really looking forward to it .
there wasa largfe group at thehotel so we had to have outlyging rooms which were ok- but not partt of the hotel so i will review those separately .
the bar , pool area and food were all superb and the standard of service was ggod .
the decor and comfort of the hotel is to a high standard and indded the owners do spend time each year during downtime redeocratig .
there are nice little touches too , such as beach towels to hire , cycles for use at will , spare suntan lotion if you forget it and the offer of a packed lunch for the airport too .
coffee was also great and i did need a regular americano by this stage- sad i know , but it was provided .
we also used the pool which was lovely , though i did get told off for walking on the narrow strip of grass and told we do n't walk on he grass- only to see a member of staff do so later .
in truth i think it 's reserved for the cats who also hang out near the pool and in fairness it 's very difficult to grow !
the addition of a pilates class was another bonus to a . . .
