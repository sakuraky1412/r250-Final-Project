durable , easy    to    read display and i like i can easily remove from mount to store in glovebox or pocket while not in car  .
can be password    protected and personalized  .
tomtom software easy to use and helpful to back up or restore it .
i knew what i is buying , i diden't want to spend a lot , i just wanted a good working gps , it works great with os x  .
and is much better then the magellen gps i had , that the maps were out of date when i baught it and would have cost me as much to update , then it did to buy this , with a better interface and it picks up the gps signal much faster  .
i would recomend this to anyone who wants a good gps that won't let them down and wo not cost them a ton .
i purchased this only because i had a $75  .
00 dell gift card  .
however , i am hooked on this model  .
my previous gps (a pharos 140 , see my review) totally sucked and i would only recommend it for dumpster ballast first , a word about people who complain or criticize that it doesn't have bluetooth , or some other high    end feature ; lighten up  .
if you desire those features then buy a gps that has them ; don't criticize one that does not this is a terrific entry    level gps  .
it initializes quickly and is accurate  .
i have tried most of the features and found this gps to be very user    friendly and the touch    screen functions are most intuitive the only problem (and a very minor one at that) is that there is no locking detent on the suction cup mount to keep the ring from backing off  .
tom may want to think about that for a re    design other than that , a top    notch gps for a budget    minded person .
i got a great black friday deal on this unit  .
this gps is more than i expected for the price i paid .
no newbie here  .
had garmin and igo before  .
tomtom is basic but has pois and great maps  .
who needs 3d buildings in there map anyway  .
anyway for the price cannot beat it .
ok , hers the scoop  .
i is very apprehensive at first , but loved it right out of the box  .
got it started quick  .
i have the vz nav on my phone and depended on it alot , but now im cancelling my vz nav , this a device you have to try for yourself , you wont be disappointed  .
i cant wait to play with it again , makes me want explore new places  .
give it a try  .

i bought this unit during christmas '08 as a present to myself due to poor navigation skills  .
for the most part i can say it has done a great job of getting me from point a to b  .
the maps seem to be for the most part accurate (see below) and have has little trouble getting to where i need i have only had trouble getting to one particular friend's house , where it sends me a few blocks away  .
maybe some confusion on road naming , i don't know , and his house seems to be unique in this problem  .
however , when i did a trip across state lines to visit a friend , did a great job of planning my trip , finding gas stations , telling me the estimated time , etc  .
that one bad location aside , cannot say i have had that many problems navigation    wise the car mounting part that came with the unit does not always seem to stick and it has fallen off multiple times  .
i have stuck it and pulled on it and it feels like a solid suction , but 10 minutes in it will come loose  .
on the other hand , have had it stick for multiple hours as well , so i do not know  .
have considered simply buying a mat and gluing the mount to the gps mat to prevent having it fall again i would definitely say that this item is a good buy , especially since most stores i have gone to now sell this at around $100 or less .
overall , for the price , this tomtom has all the features i want and need plus as a bonus it can keep an eye on your speed for you and i love the day/night light this product is great for young people that are just starting to drive and are unsure how to get to a place and how to get back  .
saves you a lot of worrying about them  .
plus if they have car problems , they can call you and tell you exactly where they are by looking at the tomtom .
great value and i am happy with it  .
nothing like a tom tom  .
try it once and you feel feel the quality  .
over all i love it  .
i know several friends who purchased one and love it  .
price is very reasonable and very affordable on a low budget .
i really like the display , the accuracy and the voice directions .
i own a magellan roadmate 2000 , a garmin nuvi 760 and a tomtom 125  .
the tomtom 125 is a bargain at only $99  .
00 and it does a great job  .
the map is accurate and satellite aquisition is fast  .
the tomtom community offers free voices , cars , map updates from fellow users  .
although it does not have bluetooth , mp3 capability , or picture viewer like my garmin it does exactly what a gps should do get you from point a to point b  .
if all you need is an accurate gps you cannot go wrong with this unit  .
buy it  .
my first gps is an lg  .
i lost the computer chip to it or i would still be using it  .
the tomtom does not come close in comparison to the quality of the lg  .
i would like to be able to get my money back ; but too late .
it wasnt bad , my other a href   http  //www  .
trackstick  .
com gps system /a is the b trackstick /b which is targeted more towards the gadgets and portable device integration for google maps and map quest  .
so this item is move integrated for automotive use  .
its is kewl not an issue about it to tell the truth it is very swell ; )  .
the 125 is a great value , especially in this economy  .
if you need a gps , and having one really beats printing out maps off the internet , it is a good choice  .
while you do not get advanced features at this price , see if you really need them  .
there are a few quirks  .
one in particular is the command to 'merge onto motorway'  .
that is confusing if there are multiple exits right up ahead  .
but otoh , it responds very quickly if i deviate slightly from it's route , say to bypass a red light , or if i miss a turn  .
nowadays , it is very trendy to have everything widescreen  .
but it has been pointed out that for a gps , you need to see what is ahead , not what is to the side  .
so the 4x3 screen works just fine , no need to feel techno    deprived .
for a cheap gps , it was not to bad but there are systems out there with the same price tag that will give you more  .
it seemed like they were so focused on getting the on screen menu's just right that they forgot about everything else  .
the mount , poi's , aquireing satelites , ect the screen size is a little small but that's the case with most in this price range  .
i'd look toward another system even if you want to save some dough  .
this one for most people probably wo not be worth the $$'s .
i should have purchased a nuvi  .
it is way too much trouble to get the one 125 working correctly , and i found their website support difficult to navigate  .
if they know they have a problem with the application , why do not they mention it in the manual  .
if the maps were accurate i would have rated the product with about 4  .
5 stars  .
i have already submitted map correction  .
but , none have been made , changed , or verified like the manual says  .
the device is only as good as the maps it can read  .
i would only recommend this product if the maps get fixed .
do your research and find a better quality product .
i use this for work and depend on it it cheaper to buy a street map or use map quest or yahoo maps  .
then wast your money on there updates  .
lol what updates only think i seen differant is the grafices wow what kind od gas staion you are passing  .
bottom line is that it did not work for me at all  .
when i told it i wanted to go home it wanted to take me in the wrong direction many miles out of the way it is a good thing i tested on the paces i knew because i would have gotten lost i did allow it to go its own way once and it took me miles frommy destination if you want to change direction it keeps telling you to turn around this is not good in case you hit a road block it does not tell yhou fast enough an alternate route sometimes the voice toldmetogoleftwhen the arrow pointed right  .
this machine is all screwed up  .
on my way home from a friends house it told me there is no possible route  .
then how did i get there   )  .

on apr 30 , 2009  .
i have recently moved to arizona and i thought i gps is something good to have to drive around find places and not get lost and makes it easy for me to get back to where i live i bought the garmin nuvi 200 it was not a bad device it gave me the best ways around except it couldn't locate my address for some reason i didn't think of finding updates so i returned it and got the tomtom one 125 it located my address at first but couldn't locate anything else i updated the deivice it wouldn't even locate my address anymore there wass this cross roads feature but it keep giving me addresses an hour away from where i am even thou i typt in the zip codes i can see the streets on my screen right in front of me but the navagation would not recognise them so i is so disapointed and just returned it and now looking for another one or maybe buying the garmin nuvi again .
we went and purchased a magellan , it's much better than the tom tom .
don't buy a tomtom product unless you have seen all features that you plan to use demonstrated on the actual model you are buying  .
in my case , the package and online documentation is wrong  .
tomtom support response is only that the tomtom one 125 will not pair with a bt phone even though the documentation says it will for traffic updates  .
i now have a gps that wo not do what it is purchased to do , even though i read the documentation .
