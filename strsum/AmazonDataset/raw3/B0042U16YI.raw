A+.
I bought this by matching up the pictures, not the model number, and guess what?  It doesn't fit.
My bad.
I waited over thirty days before trying it so I ran past the window of being able to return it.
Make sure you are replacing with a model that is compatible with your fridge.
The unit I got looks workable and probably would be fine for the right replacement, so I can't fault them for the quality (or anything else, really).
