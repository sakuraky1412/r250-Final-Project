perfect camera for beginner to intermediate photographer , very easy to use  .
this is a great piece of equipment , with virtually no limits  .
the pictures it takes in automatic mode are so superior to anything i've ever taken with smaller digital cameras , even the latest point    and    shoots  .
and all the settings of an slr are at your fingertips if you are inclined to learn about them and use them i saw that cnet had a quibble about the lens , but that is really hogwash  .
if you are a professional photographer or a very serious amateur , you might find this lens doesn't meet all your needs  .
but if you fall into that category you are not buying this camera anyway  .
for those who are in the market for this camera , this lens is an amazing piece of equipment , with state of the art image stabilizing technology this is a much better choice than the nikon for the person stepping up to dslr .
excelent digital camera for the money great pictures , easy to use if you don't use manual setting you do not need this camera  .
i would defenitly reccomend this camera to someone who is in the market for a dslr  .
its great for either shooting around the house and for vactioning , or if you like taking more professinal pictures  .
there are so many features i would be here all day trying to list them all  .
very good in performance and pictures  .
valuable  .
i love this camera , and plan to use it forever  .
great purchase , would buy it all over again  .
i threw the 28    135 usm is lens on it and it works great  .
this is a great camera , the lens is a little shaky  .
but there is always a problem with the way canon prices things i mean come on $824  .
00 is out of this world crazy  .
i have this camera only because in the beginning i said to myself i`m not going to pay the big woppin price so for 1 month i searched around and found it for $599  .
00 at geniuscamera  .
com but they told me it is on backorder so i said in with heck with that i searched a little more and found it for $575  .
00 on royalcamera  .
com i called them and they said it is in stock , i ordered it and now i have it , and it works great  .
(see what a little effort does for you  .
ok do you want to get into high quality digital photography  .
this is not a point and shoot  .
wait a minute , yes it is  .
dont get scared by the fact that this is a digital slr (single    lens reflex)  .
this camera will take the best picture you hve ever seen when using the auto mode  .
you may be asked if you are a professional  .
the camera comes with a canon ef    s 18    55mm lens  .
this is all you will need to take great pictures  .
as far as buying accesories  .
the only thing i recomend is getting a second battery  .
later after you have become more familar with the camera , then you may want to add a telephoto lens or a speedlite flash , but dont get to much at first  .
if youhave owned a 35 mm slr in the past then get ready for a new sensation  .
its like an old freind coming for a visit  .
i have wated for this camera for a while and i hve not been disapointed at all guess what  .
my wife loves it to  .
it is smaller than the original digital rebel and it is not to heavy that it gets hard to carry around  .
i admit carrying around several lens's can get a bit anoying so get a good camera case as well as a lighter case for long trips such as disney world  .
remember the lens that comes with the camera will be all you need , but once you see through a long lens then you will be hooked  .
if you are a costco member then that is the place to get the rebel xt  .
if not shop around befor you buy  .
i got mine for $825  .
00 after rebates  .
silver body  .
i wish i would have waited to get a black body .
an excellent camera with a nice price tag .
after using film slr's for years , the ease and quality of this camera has won me over to digital for good .
the 350d is a great camera for anyone looking to be introduced into the proffesional photography area  .
it's light weight body is pleasing to carry around all day , so therefor perfect for photojournalists ; although light , the body balances well with all lenses i have tried , which is up to the 70    200l , which is a large lense some people complain about the size of it , it being too small ; but in this case , the size of the 350d is perfect  .
it's easy to carry , store and shoot with the camera shoots brilliant shots , although i know the quality comes down to the lense , in which the kit lense does a good job for someone learning the ropes  .
if you wish to see some samples of photographs this camera can produce , i recommend going to my gallery , which can be found   http  //beska  .
deviantart  .
com/gallery/  .
in conclusion , a great all    round camera for entry    level photographers , as well as an worthy investment for photojournalists looking for a lightweight buddy .
best digital camera of the six i've used since 1997 .
this is a great camera  .
i took this plunge after three failed attempts with the first digirebel  .
now the digirebelxt has really outdone itself i like the preview in b/w feature so i can get the lighting right  .
is shocked to find it doesnt produce b/w images only the preview of them  .
nevertheless its easy to chage that in the raw exposure .
oh my god  .
this camera is wonderful  .
it has all the features even a pro wants  .
and its cheap , fast , can be adapted for a pro or a brgginer  .
great feel , awesome , makes you addicted to photography  .
just got it special order two weeks ago and not a single flaw  .
its so good , you have to get it and trust me you will love it sooo much  .
cnet is wrong about the kit lens ; it is not an l lens , sure , but it is very good nonetheless  .
i have samples here   www  .
pinholemedia  .
com  .
i had the old drebel and there is no comparison  .
this dslr is very fast , is loaded with mid/high end slr features , and creeps up very closely to the 20d in virtually every way  .
the equivalent in nikon and pentax , as well as the others , do not prove to be much competition  .
go with the best    go with this canon .
if you are reading this then you must be looking for a used or refurbished xt because it is now discontinued  .
however , you can find tons of them online for a heck of a bargain ($250 or less  .
i got mine just as it is leaving in 2008 and i've used it for almost a year  .
i would still pick this model over the xs/xsi because of the use of compact flash storage    much faster and easier to use (try keeping a few microsd's in a big camera bag  .
plus , 8mp's is enough for everyone until you blow up past 18x24 prints  .
i got a battery grip for cheap and it makes a world of a difference in the weight and feel of the camera , this is a must  .
get a 50mm f/1  .
8 prime lens for less than $100 while you're at it too , it is incredible  .
any reviewer on the net will tell you it is the best lens for the money  .
add this all up , xt + grip + 50mm and you are still not paying as much as the xs if you shop around  .
do your research and see how great this camera still is  .
i am really pleased with this camera  .
in hindsight , though , i wish i had done more research about lenses  .
i would have purchased the camera body and bought a better lens than the one that came with the camera  .
it is ok , but i could have saved some money on the kit that could have been invested in something better .
i traded up to the digital rebel xt from my disappointing kodak z712  .
this is my first official dslr and all i can say is that this camera is amazing  .
the price tag hurt the bank a bit , especially after forking over more money for the pricey cf memory card and bag , but it is well worth it unlike my previous camera , the rebel xt handles low    light conditions gracefully , even better with manual settings  .
no artifacts or blurry backgrounds  .
macro photography is outstanding  .
i took the camera out for some landscape shooting and close ups on wooden fences , flowers , etc , and everything came back is full detail the bundled software is pretty nice , although i'm doing everything in photoshop for final work on the images  .
easily transfers photos to my imac , no compatibility issues whatsoever  .
intuitive battery pack that lasts long is a nice plus overall , it's the best camera i've ever owned and would strongly recommend it .
i is looking for a nikon d40 but decided to go canon instead reason one , canon has around 50 percent of the market share for all digital cameras  .
everyone else splits up the remaining 50 percent , that equals lots of oem and after market accessories reason two , by far and away the most popular camera on all of flickr (as of 11    07) is the xt reason three , i know people with rebel family cameras so i can borrow lenses reason four , for $15 i got an adapter from ebay to fit my nikon ai lenses  .
manual focus , but the canon will meter  .
ai lenses on d40 are a direct fit still manual focus , but no metering .
first of all you never get what dslr is capable unless you forget about auto modes  .
dslr is about taking control of the camera , not about the camera taking control of you (like p s models)  .
so if you agree with this then you may find my review useful impressions of xti (400d) user (which is me)    .
1) speaking of lenses my finding is that whatever you hear canon lenses fit best on canon  .
third party lenses must be carefully chosen as not all of them would have good iq 2) color rendition sometimes can be awkward with third party lens and kit lens 3) shutter sound  .
yep someone mentioned loud sound on pentax  .
i can say xti also delivers a funny loud sound , nikon d80 is a way quieter and overall better 4) size of xti  .
grip is a bit small but manageable to hold and is not so inconvenient unless you have very large hands , but when a solid (weight) lens is attached to xti the camera tends to hang down on your neck like a dead albatross which is not convenient as often you have to hold camera by the lens 5) responsiveness of xti is generally very good , but when flash is used the camera often delivers a message flash busy which slows down things sometimes 6) auto modes are not the best  .
in fact you better forget about them and use only creative mode zones , for ones wishing auto turn to p mode which gives some useful flexibility  .
in auto many photos go to waste fom my experience 7) low light capabilities of xti are truly outstanding , going up to 800 iso is not a problem at all 8) focusing is generally very good under day light with decent lens , not so under poor light , raising flash for af assist one must disable flash firing unless willing to use a flash  .
i did not find a way how to make af assist operate without a need of disabling flash each time before shooting 9) af modes a trouble , i found ai servo poor , i tend to use single shot 10) sharpness , saturation need tweaking , sharpness needs going higher , saturation a step down from mid point  .
i am not sure about contrast but it feels like it must be turned a step down from mid point as well 11) whatever one might say i found kit lens to be a big piece of crap , soft and poor images most of the time , but focus is very quick (if one forgets quality of images)  .
so my kit lens stays for the most where it should    which is in the box 12) xti lcd , this is really what surprised me  .
first of all it is not as bright as i would wish it to be , and i am not sure if it has good enough resolution , but more trouble i find that it is unable to show accurate color in preview , so you can see what your photos turned only when on pc  .
also , it tends to show photos in preview brighter than they are in reality 13) optical viewfinder is not great , darker than nikon (i tested in shop) and narrow view which i find troubling for using wide angle lens my overall impression    .
xti is very good camera but not a ground breaker as some people claim  .
also canon products are often overpriced vs  .
what you get  .
this concerns lenses , original accessories etc  .
as for service quality , this varies from country to country so check your location  .
beware in your country you might not have full canon office , which means they have to mail your problems or replacement order to nearest central office for your region , hence longer waiting .
i moved up from a minolta dimage z6 which is a nice point and shoot camera and i can never look back  .
i feel in love with this camera instantly and love the instant startup and no lag for action shots  .
with children in sports this camera is a god    send  .
if you are new to the digital slr venue , you can not go wrong with this feature packed camera  .
the camera takes great detailed shots , the colors are deep and rich , the auto focus is responisve  .
this is one of the best cameras out there  .
its in the high middle for photographers  .
what i mean by this , is that it far surpasses your standard point and shoot cameras , and is powerful and simple enough to be of use to photographers from the noobiest of noobs to near professionals  .
while it may lack the total fit and finish for pros , it is definitely a great camera  .
not just for the money , (although it is) but just an all around great camera  .
one of the best things would be the fact that you have a slough of lenses to choose from  .
(yes the kit lens is not good for much of anything , but why not take the money you saved not buying another camera and go buy a good lens) this is one of the best cameras i've ever had the privilege to use and own  .
definitely a deal you should not pass up .
the canon digital rebel xt is a great starter to slrs although it is not a future full as some of canons higher up models , it does is great job  .
the worst part is the crop factor of 1  .
6 with this camera it is very hard to get a wide angel shot because the focal length of the lens it multiplied by 1  .
18mm    29mm  .
this is good if you like to use longer focal lengths though , you can get a 480mm lens for the price of a 300mm lens , the longer lengths get pricey  .
other wise this is a wonderful camera .
great consumer camera , optics are great (its a canon) , tons of features  .
this is way more camera than the standard consumer needs but allows some very top quality photos screen is a little small but larger on the new xti , also i prefer the size of the 30d , but all in all this is a ton of camera for the money .
this camera provides a lot of bang for the buck  .
jpegs are fabulous    right out of the camera  .
just do yourself a favor and get a better lens  .
the only real complaint i have about the camera itself is the lack of a spot meter , but you can easily get around that by manually setting the exposure .
i have not taken such good pictures since i bought my first canon av1 back in 1980  .
this camera is usable as a point    and    shoot but exploring the different settings has paid off big time  .
i use a tamron 28    300 lens , which is inexpensive (relatively) and is very versatile  .
the shutter lag is non    existent and the fast shooting mode gives a stop    action result which can be hysterical when properly arrayed in a slide show  .
the battery life nearly makes me regret buying a back    up battery , as i can easily take over 1 , 000 shots before it needs recharging my previous camera is a nikon coolpix 885 , and as most will tell you , the shutter lag on the nikon cameras are a huge drawback  .
i missed so many 'moments' with the coopix , but never again thanks to my canon  .
i needed a camera that is a step up from a point and shoot , but i wanted a digital slr that is easy to use  .
i did some research online and picked out 3 cameras that i thought i would like , (canon eos 5d , nikon d200 , and eos 30d)  .
i didn't even look at the rebel , because i figured that for the price it would not have many options , and would not meet my needs  .
i actually is playing with the rebel at the stores counter while the clerk got out the another camera  .
so i compared the rebel to the cameras i had planned on getting  .
the rebel turned out to have everything i is looking for and cost about $500 less then the 30d  .
i is able to get the rebel , a full size mini tripod , a case , plus the memory for under $700 what a great deal  .
i am by no means a pro when it comes to slr cameras , but i do not have to be  .
the rebel is quick and easy to learn , and i could find no noise or artifacts in my pictures  .
i have no complaints about the 18    55mm lens that came with my camera , either  .
it takes good pictures , and is a great starter lens to learn on .
i is debating on either getting a nikon d50 or a canon rebel xt and decided to go with the canon and i have never looked back  .
i do concert photography and this camera performs extrodinaryly in low light situations at a high iso setting  .
the picture quality is just amazing and the camera is very responsive  .
i did not buy it with the kit lens and got a nicer piece of glass , i'd recommend anyone else to do the same , but seriosly , best camera ever  .
this is something i encourage everybody thats looking to consider .
i have used a pentax slr for a number of years , and i like to try to take some really nice artys photographs once in awhile , ran up a big bill on film (wife gets mad) , wanted to switch to digital , did all the comparisons  .
finally talked to the artists in my company , they all recommended this camera  .
i have taken pictures and is floored at the great pictures you can get  .
i took a picture of a woodpecker , from far away , and blew it up  .
did not get any distortion what so ever , blew it up from what looked like a quarter of an inch to about 4 inches , and it looked great  .
ok , now to the camera , easy , great instruction book with it , does not come with memory card , that means , buy one before you leave the store  .
neat , and i mean neat , little battery recharger , fits anywhere , and it folds down  .
charges in about 90 minutes  .
comes with flash , that works great  .
lightweight for the women , and some complain about the size , i like it , my pinkie fits under it and levels and steadies it  .
also gives you a usb cable to move pictures direct from camera to pc  .
software is pretty good for beginners also  .
great camera for price  .
i bought it a circuit city with a zoom lens for about $1038  .
00 , i would buy it again  .
to be honest , i am not the greatest photographer , and this just really is a great camera for us amatuers , and people who want to start digital picture taking with an slr  .
i need to put in 9 or 10 , i want to say 9  .
5 because it doesn't give you the memory card  .
but hey , if you are not too snobish to think you have to have a professional camera , this is the one for you .
i think this camera is amazing  .
i have owned the rebel for about three months [more or less] and absolutely adore it  .
its quality is outstanding  .
my family members and i were impressed a lot  .
i love photography and this is a bargain , too  .
i got it for about $700 online at a cnet recommended website  .
that's about $300 less than its retail price  .
(with lens  .
the only con i can currently think of is the flash  .
i'm not a fan of it as it can be too overpowering and take away from the photographic point of a shot , but it can be replaced i suppose  .
for now i just put my hand over it and i'm loving it  .
first of all , i am a beginner , and i don't know all about the technical mumbo    jumbo stuff that is involved with the dslr cameras  .
i have been scanning through some of these reviews , and i'm shocked to see so many reviews just totally putting down this camera  .
check some of the photo galleries people make with these , they are absolutely beautiful  .
when you see what this camera can do when you know how to use it , does it really matter if it does not have all the high end features  .
if your a pro that has a couple canon mark ii's , than yea , it's probably not going to suit you , but if your new or amateur , it's a great camera  .
i'm really happy with this camera  .
very satisfied with photo quality , will be more safisfied when i learn more about it  .
to me it's all about the image quality , and just capturing a moment , not always worrying about the technical stuff .
my first dsrl  .
i had have a canon a80 for some years now and i'm very happy with the performance and quality , so i decided to upgrade  .
the xt is so good i'm starting my own bussiness as a wedding photographer the pictures i've taken are great  .
color , white balance , etc the best purchase i've done in a while  .
the con is the price for lenses and accesories here in mexico (almost 100% more than in the us) and aviability since we do not get everything  .
i've tried to buy online but many sites or brands do not ship outside the us .
over all this camera is wonderful  .
its easy to use and understand for anyone who is not familiar with digital cameras  .
however , if you choose to purchase this camera i strongly suggest you look into purchasing additional lenses as well , i would have thought canon would include a longer ranged zoom lense with this kit  .
the different types of settings is what peaked my interests in this camera , not to mention the larger megabites  .
the clarity of my photos are clearer brighter than ever  .
i highly recommend this camera  .
this is a great , great camera  .
i've had it for over a month now and it's virtually impossible to take a bad photo .
i absolutely love this camera  .
this is a great camera for the money  .
i have used a canon eos film body for the longest time , and this felt exactly like the film body  .
very small learning curve if you are familiar with the canon system and if you have a bag of canon lenses , look no further  .
this camera is built on essentially the same chassis as the eos 20d , so save the 700 dollars and put it into a nice lens and go with the rebel xt  .
my only complaint is the battery compartment  .
the battery door itself is a little tricky for those with shorter nails  .
i have to keep mine very short because of gymnastics , and the door is therefore a little hard to open  .
those on the nikons seem to be a little more friendly in that sense  .
regardless , this is a top notch camera for the price  .
this is an incredible camera  .
i recently bought it for my wife for her 30th birthday  .
it has a great automatic mode for photo    idiots like myself that just want to point and shoot , and tons of great features for my wife to elt her artsy side out my o    n    l    y complaint about the camera is its size  .
i'm 6'1 with appropriately sized hands , and the camera does feel a wee bit awkwardly small in my hands .
as i am a complete novice , this review may be helpul to other novices  .
the more experienced may want to skip this in search of an entry    level slr , i had my eyes on the digital rebel xt for the past six months  .
prices just began to drop  .
i got mine for $699  .
00 in a store rather than online  .
i wanted to do this in case there were problems with the unit  .
rather than ship the unit back to an online store , i need the salespersons expertise as of now , i can only use the automatic settings very well and not the manual settings (am learning every day)  .
i got the camera home and set    up took 10 minutes at the most  .
i is taking pictures in 15 minutes  .
upon downloading the pictures to my pc , they all looked grainy/fuzzy and i thought the camera is a lemon i went back to the store and an informed salesman said it is the lens  .
this caused me to shell    out $399  .
00 retail price for a tamron af 18    200 mm lens and now the camera takes wonderul pictures  .
this lens does not have image stabalization so zoomed shots are a little fuzzy , but all others look excellent i went back and bought a canon 28    135 lens for $429  .
00 with image stabalization and the pictures are perfect  .
not sure which lens to return so professionals reading this please reply paying retail for lenses is not my favorite thing , but the salespeople knew what worked and showed spent 30 minutes showing how to use the camera on manual mode  .
i paid for expertise the camera is heavier with the better lenses and is difficult to grip for extended periods  .
there is not a lens cover for the camera itself (unless it is not in my package only) so you must keep the lens on the camera to protect the internals this is an easy camera to learn , learn and learn  .
so much to know on the manual settings  .
you can spend hours learning this camera and never lose interest the user manual actually is great unlike many sony manuals i suffered through in the past this makes a good camera to learn from  .
picture quality is excellent with the better lenses  .
some of the photos look like magazine quality not sure why canon sells the camera with a lousy lens , but others have posted this before so beware if you are about to purchase this  .
opt for the kit without the lens to avoid an expensive paperweight .
this camera is simply fantastic  .
to current 35mm slr users who are considering switching to digital but are afraid of feeling lost in the world of digital , let me tell you this is not a digital camera with the eos sticker smacked on it ; this is a true eos in every aspect  .
you'll simply love it and will feel you got the best value for your money (i still do)  .
it also blows away whatever bad experience you might've had with digital point    and    shoot cameras and their 10    second battery life  .
for a digital full slr this camera gives you lots of power being a true slr , the camera is small (not tiny) , comfortable and lightweight  .
all buttons , dials , and other switches are intuitively placed (typical eos) and very easy to use  .
it's also very fast at everything it does some people say the body material feels and looks cheap  .
it's definitely not the same body material as an eos 1d , but cheap is too strong of a word to describe the xt's body material  .
if your opinion falls into this category , then an option would be to get the black body instead of silver  .
remember this camera is not marketed as a professional model although its performance and shots are at the professional level indeed image quality is fabulous  .
color fidelity , sharpness , etc  .
this camera offers the best in its class and other classes a few notches up too  .
do an online search under the camera name and you'll come across pros who've posted tests between this camera and more expensive models with similar resolution and you'll see how this model delivers the same or even superior images than cameras twice or three times more expensive now , speaking of image , there is one problem with the kit canon markets this camera as part of  .
as mind    blowing as the camera image capabilities are , the included 18    55mm canon lens is simply mediocre and sometimes it quite undermines the camera's image quality  .
believe me , it's simply like putting baby stroller wheels on a brand    new lexus  .
it's good to quench the initial fever to take some shots right after you pull it out of the box , but my advice is get yourself a good lens on the side  .
then you'll squeeze every drop of superb quality this camera offers .
this camera put the fun back into taking pictures  .
and it eliminates the digital aspect  .
the pictures are so good , i am constantly amazed  .
i also have the canon 75    300 zoom lens , and it takes such great shots  .
i have countless people ask for extra disks of the pictures  .
also , just from seeing mine and checking it out and trying it , three friends already bought one , also  .
a great camera with a very good picture quality , a nd a fast enough shutter speed to cure even the most inexperienced shaker .
just purchased the digital rebel xt about a week ago and i've been busy playing around with it , taking test shots just learning how to use it i'm a very happy customer  .
i love this camera  .
it's not complicated and takes fantastic shot  .
it looks great , feels great has lots of options functions to use test out  .
my only complaint is the lens is just average i realize it's a starter lens but it could be better    again , i'm still a happy camper definitely do not regret getting this camera  .
to me it's worth every penny someday plan on buying extra lenses flashes for it .
i have had this camera since it's release  .
my education from georgia tech included photography from the now famous joe decasserus  .
joe always said that it's not the camera , but the photographer , that makes a good picture  .
okay , perhaps so , but not until this camera have i really felt like i have a tool that can match the film cameras that i had back in 1970 after a semi    pro film assignment a couple of weeks ago i received this e    mail    .
i can not put into words what your photo presentation did for me  .
first we felt we were there  .
in fact i felt at times you had done it for us because we could not be there  .
a mushy moment while i is looking at your master piece  .
i have never seen a field trial , grounds , dogs and friends look so good in person  .
you certainly have a talent and it is not just with the camera  .
you captured the esence of bird dogs in the black belt of alabama i used both the 18    55mm and the 75    300 with image stabilzation  .
the large clear viewfinder gave me the ability to aquire the scene quickly and the very fast recovery time allowed me to take several shots in a few seconds to get good action shots  .
the autofocus worked flawlessly and except for the one time that i did not mount the lens completely , the camera worked perfectly like a tool built just for me some people think that the eos is too light and lacks the heft of a metal camera  .
but i liked the lightweight and the size , although larger than the compact cameras , is good for my sometimes gloved hands my only improvement would be an option for a higher res picture for those seldom times where you know that you are going to blow this one up to 30 x 40 .
loved it    used it for work when i went with besife tonwe to picture rigs  .
compact , uncomplicated and well designed  .
sometimes cameras are over    engineered but not this one  .
also liked the pixel count  .
good cost quality ratio .
canon's aim is to market an excellent camera at a reasonable price like this one so they could get to another $3000 of my money for lenses and other canon attachements  .
well , it worked .
i have had this camera for over 8 months now and absolutely love it  .
the size of the body , variety of lenses available , good grip , very low noies in high iso numbers , close to perfect white balancing in tricky situations are just some of the features packed in this camera  .
at first i is not happy with the cheap finishing on the body but it will feel better gradually  .
the kit lens is just a waste of money  .
i replaced the kit lens with a ef usm ii 28    105 lens instantly  .
battery life is just great , i do not see a need for buying the attachment for extra battery  .
i have been a long term user of nikon cameras , but i should admit i doubt if i will ever go back to nikon  .
canon is my choice in digital world .
i took the rebel xt with two zoom lens on a kenyan safari and found that it is exceptionally reliable with few exceptions  .
conditions were tough because you are frequently taking photos on the move and dust is a constant problem  .
the image stabilizer for the telephoto lens is worth every penny as is the lens hood  .
i used a monopole for support , though one could use a soft sack when standing up .
this is the camera for a high    functioning amateur or semi    pro wannabe  .
the digital rebel xt offers you the ability to go fully auto , or fully manual or bits in between  .
so , as you learn more about the camera and your art , you can become more creative  .
also , there are dozens , upon dozens of interesting lenses to go micro , macro or long distance  .
i recommend that you replace the 18mm to 55mm lens that comes standard with the camera , it's almost as worthless as an old fashioned instamatic  .
i bought a 28mm to 105mm that i now use as a kind of utility lens , it's like a breath of fresh air  .
i also use a 75mm to 300mm lens and a 500mm to 1000mm lens needless to say , i really enjoy my investment in this camera and recommend it to anyone who is serious about digital photography if all you want to do is take a couple photos of your family and the dog , save your money  .
buy a less expensive point    n    shoot as this device is complex for your needs .
i recently bought one  .
i shot my first set of photos indoor , outdoor , at night  .
the picutres were impressive  .
the camera is very intuitive  .
in the automatic mode it does a great job  .
light weight , easy to use , good pictures  .
what is not to like about this device  .

what is not to like about this device  .
i bought this camera to shoot holiday pictures at my aunts house which has given me a tough time getting good pictures every single year , whether it is white balance or image noise no digital camera has come through without some serious use of the manual settings , and even then the shots were just ok i am glad to say on the full auto setting i got the best shots i have ever taken every slams the lens that comes with the camera , but it is a nice start and is does get the job done let me finish with the camera deserves a perfect 10 for image quality .
this camera is for advanced photographers , the hobbyist will like th auto side untill you figure out those damb buttons  .
clear pics at the drop of a hat software confusing  .
this is one amazing camera  .
i just got back from ireland and used this camera for the first time over there  .
my friends have all seen the shots and were blown away , as is i  .
i'm talking , these are shots suitable for poster size enlargement  .
there have been complaints about the autofocus , but it just takes some getting used to , as well as the ability and time to work with it and figure it out (you can always go manual of course too) the only thing i'm glad i changed is upgrading from the kit lens to a canon efs 17    85mm is usm lens  .
this lens is quite amazing for just a general purpose lens  .
i do plan on buying a specialty zoom sometime  .
i got a great deal on the camera through cameta camera auctions on ebay  .
i highly recommend buying a package because you will get a bag , a higher capacity flash card , and other necessary gear to enjoy this camera at a serious discount this camera is challenging enough to keep me interested for quite a long time , but not so tough that i'm lost if your budget is under $1200  .
00 for the package deal , get the upgraded lens  .
this is a great camera       easy to use , spectacular pictures , big improvement over the previous version  .
i have used both a nikon d70 and canon rebel xt , and the canon wins the battle hands    down  .
the l8    55 lens is much better than previous reviewers have indicated , and the 75    300 is a great addition for a reasonable price .
canon has done it again  .
i upgraded from the canon original digital rebel  .
this camera has most of the features/quality of the canon 20 for a fraction of the cost  .
i purchased the bg    3 battery grip and now the camera is easy to hold and holds two batteries  .
the lens that comes with the unit is decent  .
there are hundreds of compatible lenses to choose from  .
i purchased a tamron 300 zoom lens and it is fantastic the digital rebel xt is a great camera for the $$  .
there is not another camera in the sub 1000  .
00 price range that comes close to matching all its features  .
canon's rebels also have great resale value for i sold my first digital rebel for 80% of what i paid for it .
introduction  .
fed    up with the limitations of point    and    shoot (p s) digital cameras , i finally decided it is time to move up to the digital slr world  .
after a great deal of research , i finally decided on the nikon d70  .
the canon 20d is too expensive and i did not like the canon rebel eos 300d  .
when i went to a local camera store to purchase the d70 , the salesperson is showing the rebel xt , which just arrived , to a customer  .
after trying both the d70 and rebel xt , and comparing features , i ended up purchasing the canon rebel xt nikon is offering a $200 rebate on the d70 making it compatible with the $999 price tag on the rebel xt  .
both are fine cameras and you wont go wrong with either one however , i decided on the rebel xt because of  .
price (didnt want to wait on the rebate)  .
size and weight (much smaller and lighter than the nikon d70 or canon 20d)  .
8 mp (i do a great deal of software cropping)  .
many of my friends use canon (can borrow their stuff) the rebel xt is an entry level digital slr and is being ranked in that category  .
one reason canon produced such an attractive price\feature camera is they know consumers are less likely to switch brands once they are invested in one brand's lenses and equipment cool features  .

small lcd and view finder  .
fact or fiction  .
auto    focus has problems in low    light  i did experience a little of this , but nothing major  .
turning the focus ring a little manually and letting auto    focus kick in again seems to help   auto    focus slower than 20d  yes , but what do you expect for a $600 price difference  .
the auto    focus is still fast  .
good lenses will help keep the auto    focus as fast as possible   made of cheap plastic  actually it is made of polycarbonate  .
this lightweight material is so heat , cold and shatter resistant , aircraft windshields are made of it  .
do an internet search for polycarbonate and youll probably be pleasantly surprised   goes up to iso 100  true , it goes from 100    1600  .
the nikon d70 goes from iso 200  1600   only goes down to iso 1600 true , but the nikon d70 only goes to iso 1600 also and the canon 20d will only go to iso 3200 by using a custom function  .
there are software hacks available to make the iso 3200 setting available on the rebel eos 300d (rebel xts predecessor) , but rumor has it iso 3200 will not be available on the rebel xt even with a software hack  .
but when would you use iso 3200  .
at poorly lit night games , early morning or night time nature shots , rock concerts  .
if you dont photograph at dark events such as those , iso 3200 is not needed   too small for big hands  my brother    in    law is 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 250 lbs  .
he uses a smaller p s camera with no problems  .
if it is really an issue , a battery pack will add heft and grip space while increasing your battery capacity   not a professional camera  i know of 1 professional photographer who shoots professionally with the rebel xt , 1 prosumer that uses it for weddings and a 3rd retired professional who is getting back into photography who will purchase it  .
other online reviews of professional photographers show they use it professionally too  .
image quality difference between the rebel xt and the 20d is non    existent in my amateur eyes   the lcd and view finder are small  small is subjective , but i do think they are on the small side  .
the lcd is 1  .
8 inches and the view finder is about 10% smaller than the 20d   lcd menus are hard to read in bright light  i have good vision and had no problems if the lcd is set to its brightest display  .
if someone really has trouble , they can just turn their back to the sun and adjust setting in their body shadow   menus are hard to use  well , they are more cumbersome than the 20d , but i wouldnt say hard to use   iso setting not visible in the viewfinder  sadly , very true , but other cameras lack this feature as well tips  .
the canon rebel xt and the 20d might be thought of as a toyota camry and lexus  .
both with get you from point a to point b , but the lexus will get you there in more comfort and style the 20d is easier to navigate , has more features , more auto    focus points (9 vs 7) , better quality and faster auto    focus , 66% faster fps (5 fps vs 3 fps) , larger frame buffer (23 vs 14) , has a larger lcd , faster shutter (1/8000 vs 1/4000) , faster flash x    sync speed (1/250 vs 1/200) , a longer lasting battery (1000 shots vs 600) , faster shutter lag (65ms vs 100ms) , shortened view finder blackout (115ms vs 170ms) , more custom functions (18 vs 9) , ships with better software (adobe photoshop elements 2 vs arcsoft photo studio 5  .
5) , offers a lower iso (3200 vs 1600) , and has a longer shutter life (150 , 000 vs 50000) shots  .
if you consider repairing a shutter costs about $250 , the price between the two cameras even out in the long run  .
(some put the shutter life of the 20d at about 100 , 000 cycles instead of 150 , 000  .
if you can afford it , go with the 20d  .
if you cant afford it , the rebel xt is a very capable performer  .
id rather have the rebel xt and a good lens than the 20d and a mediocre lens  .
consider ordering the rebel xt without the lens kit and invest the savings in a good quality lens , such as a canon ultrasonic lens that said , id rather have the rebel xt in some situations , like and fishing or hiking trips  .
some people with small hands would probably prefer the rebel xt  .
if you wont use the extra features , why spend the money on the 20d  .
a newer better camera will come out and some people wont feel so bad upgrading if they have the rebel xt also , go to frys or a local camera shot to try out any cameras and then consider purchasing it from a reputable on    line retailer if they offer a lower price  .
i would have purchased over the internet , but i wanted the ability to return it quickly and get something else if i changed my mind beware of any stores return policy , the fine print may state you can return the camera in a certain amount of days if you dont open the software , which the salesperson neglected to mention to me purchase at least a 1 gb high speed compact flash with the either the rebel xt or 20d be prepared to invest more money and time when entering the digital slr world  .
quality lenses are expensive and you'll need a good add    on flash eventually  .
some photography classes offered at a local community college or photo shop can take you to the next level as mentioned earlier , the nikon d70 is a good choice too and some reviewers think it is the better camera  .
if you can wait , nikon will answer the rebel xt with something very good , and that will give you even more choices  .
but if youre waiting for the leap frogging to stop before you buy , youll be waiting a long time .
used my xt since the beginning of april , taken approx  .
10 , 000 shots from sports action to sight    seeing and i'm spoiled i have the canon 18    55 kit lens and the ef55    200 for more  .
with the instant responsiveness , i do not miss many shots  .
i recommend a 50x or faster 2gb card for it .
this review is from a relatively new photography hobbyist joining the world of digital slr's , for anyone in the same shoes looking to get into dslr cameras i longed for a camera that i could grow with , and learn , hoping one day to learn more about photography and enjoy myself doing it  .
i didn't want to commit to a point and shoot camera even though the newer ones have lense attachments and new features similar to dslr's  .
i also wanted a camera that would allow me to grow as a photographer i looked at a few cameras around the same price range which were the rebel 300d (standard) rebel 350d (xt) nikon 50d and 70d obviously i chose the xt and do not regret it  .
there are may reasons why i love this camera quality   at 8mp this camera is capable of some quality shots even at 11x14  .
i is impressed even with the kit lens how sharp and colourful the pictures were  .
the lens kit is not as bad as people say it is , considering it's price  .
if you could afford some quality lenses like the l series or prime lenses , than the quality would be even greater build   at first i was not to keen on the plastic body , but it's definitely not flimsy  .
the body is strong enough to hold it's own  .
plus after spending a whole day at the zoo it is nice to have a light camera and it was not tiresome to lug around my shoulder and kneck  .
with my zoom lense it adds enough wait to balance it out  .
i do find it to be a tad small , my hands felt slightly cramped after that day , but then again i took many shots and took many the other day as well  .
it� s probably my techniques as well  .
the battery grip helps to balance this out tremendously which i hope to purchase soon ease of use   the first day i got the xt i just tried automatic and some of the basic modes and the pictures turned out great  .
it can work as a p/s camera but you will want to learn the creative modes or go full manual  .
the creative modes allow you to focus on one thing like shutterspeed (tv mode) and the camera sets the fstop for you  .
this is great to learn how your shots are taken and how you can improve on them  .
personally i like using these modes but i� m starting to learn to use the camera in full manual mode features   there are so many that it would keep a beginner like myself busy for awhile learning the different features of this camera  .
the reviews cover it pretty well so i won� t get into it here price   in my opinion , this camera is the best buy compared to others in it� s range , best bang for the buck  .
this camera can be compared to the 20d as well , not as equal to but in terms of picture quality they are very close conclusion   i am truly satisfied with this camera  .
i think it� s a great camera for those who are beginners to intermediate  .
there� s a lot of room to learn how the camera works and understanding slr cameras  .
i plan on using this camera for awhile and hope to one day upgrade to a more �sprofessional�� camera , but for now i� m happy with my xt .
now , i will start by saying that this is my first digital slr , so i will not claim to be an expert with experience across the board  .
i will however tell you that i love the camera that i bought and give a quick explanation as to why first off , my girlfriend and i bought cameras a the same time  .
i bought the rebel xt and she bought the rebel  .
at first i liked the size and feel of hers much better than mine , but as time went on and i used the camera more , that changed  .
now , when i pick up her camera , it feels too big and heavy  .
don't let the size be your reason to get something else  .
i almost did , and i know now that i would have serious regrets had i done that now , the basics  .
image quality is great  .
anyone from beginners that are willing to do some reading and learning , to semi    pros looking to take stunning pictures can enjoy this camera  .
i have seen pictures taken with this camera that are crystal clear and have the brightest and most alive colors ever  .
battery life is incredible  .
the little thing that comes with the camera is enough to take at least 500 pictures before even dreaming of a recharge  .
i bought a 1500mah battery , which i left in the camera for an entire week while i is on vacation taking pictures now , for the most important part  .
lots of people will complain about two things with this camera  .
one being the size , and the other being the plastic construction  .
i will repeat again , do not let the size be your only reason not to buy this camera  .
it will grow on you and soon enough be something you enjoy more than dislike  .
now , on to the plastic construction  .
this camera is made to sell for under $1000 and does not have all the features of a $7000 camera , plain and simple  .
i have yet to encounter a situation in which i said , oh no , i hope the plastic body does not crack or warp  .
chances are , if your taking pictures in an environment you would ask that question , you will have no problem shelling out some extra cash for a nicer camera anyway bottom line , this camera cannot be beat for the price it is offered at  .
look at the ratings on this site from people who know what they are talking about , and you will see this  .
i hope this helps anyone with their decision to buy this camera , or even choose something else instead .
i've been using a film slr for over 10yrs and have avoided purchasing a dslr mainly because i just did not believe that the image quality could rival that of what is captured on film i is wrong , but glad i waited for this camera to come along  .
the images are superb and the camera handles excellently  .
i differ with those who claims a cheap feel to the camera body  .
it does not feel like cheap plastic at all (in my opinion)  .
i found it to be quite comfortable to handle and had a nice feel in my hands i did find the camera smaller in size when compared to my slr , but it does the job as well as the big guys i have to admit that i don't use the kit lens that often , but i'm still glad i have it    it has come in handy  .
i purchased the 50mm 1  .
8 lens and it's great as well  .
in my opinion they should have offered the 50mm 1  .
8 as kit lens instead i went with a 2gb microdrive and it works excellently with this camera  .
if money is tight , a 512mb would be just fine though the bundled software for the xt is pretty nice as well  .
usually i look down on bundled software for the peripherals that i've purchased in the past , but the xt actually comes with impressive software that is quite usefull some even prefer it over photoshop cs2 in regards to handling raw files , saying that canon's dpp software is easier , faster , and overall handles the file much better than ps cs2 this camera an excellent choice  .
i don't even find myself envious of those that own the more expensive top of the line canon dslrs my only guilt is that after i've uploaded the images into my hard drive , i feel a bit sad that i do not have an actual film negative or slide    the images this camera takes are that great  .
it makes me feel bad that i cannot make a print of the images in a an old fashioned darkroom .
i have been waiting for the quality/price factor to make a digital slr feasable ever since digital photography became a reality  .
this camera is a perfect first step since it works with the canon lenses i already have and costs less than $1 , 000  .
i've owned it for about two months and think it is absolutely fantastic  .
i typically use it to shoot family events like vacations and sports events and really like the results  .
it is easy to use and seldom fails to meet the challenge  .
the only time i wish it could do more is when a spot meter is appropriate  .
i think the big reason for owning a slr is to control the depth of field and i'm surprised this does not have a spot option  .
i'm a big guy and the size is not a problem either  .
much more comfortable to hold than a point and shoot digital camera if you are used to an slr  .
this is a great camera that i recommend to anyone .
canon eos 350d is the most sophisticated gadget i ever have  .
previously i have a 35 mm film camera and pocket digital camera and this camera more valuable for the semi professional consumers  .
start with the new look design (smaller then nikon d 70s or d 50) and light then both of its  .
the feature its rich  .
you can find this feature in professional camera also  .
the advantage of this gadget is you can set every scene manually or automatic from focus , white balance , aperture , speed , flash , iso , metering etc  .
this is important for the professional photographer to have the best photo  .
continues shooting feature is 3 times a second and starting time below a second  .
i just bought i month ago and i feel i already expert on using it  .
i try a many setting in manual shoot with set the aperture , white balance and aperture the result is very good that i never have a photo like it is before  .
the battery is good even i already shoot 100 times with maximum jpg files (8 m pixel) the batteries still function in good condition  .
the 350d can use any canon mount lenses  .
i recommend this camera for the professional photographer beside the complete features this gadget has a valuable compare its price  .
you can have this gadget with standard lens of ef    s 18    55 mm with only $800  .
you will be a professional shortly with this prosumer camera .
i is really excited about this camera since i owned a canon rebel which is stolen  .
so when i found out that the digital version is on the works i knew i had to buy it  .
i am very happy i did  .
the only draw back is that i had to return the original one due to defective card slot  .
since i purchased through the military catalog the return is hassle free and i reordered the camera  .
best decision i ever made  .
i am so pleased with this camera that i will recommend .
i love this camera  .
it's got everything that an not    yet    professional    but    getting    close user might want  .
seriously good auto focus , solid lens , color regeneration is wonderful and the overall feel and speed to just what i wanted the only gripe i have (and it may be because i have not gotten my settings right) is the pop up flash , which comes on more than i want it to  .
i usually end up falling back to the preset no flash option  .
i have taken thousands of photos with this already and dark , bright , fast motion , macro , and so on all look great  .
whenever i get that perfect picture , i say to myself damn , i am glad i got this camera  .
(i have only had it for 3 weeks i am sure that will wear off) the strap it comes with is ok , nothing special  .
i got a nice camera bag to go with it    although large to carry around , that's kind of a given with slr's so unless you are a professional photog who has specific needs in any given photo situation , my guess is that you are going to be quite happy with this purchase i got mine with a few price matching pushes for $780 yes , a sweet deal given what it seems to be going for today .
i hear a lot of folks complaining that the camera is small and uncomfertable  .
i've been taking pictures almost non    stop since i purchased the camera a week ago and have no complaints  .
i'm almost 6'4 with big hands and i find the camera very , very comfortable to use  .
probably worth a trip to your nearest camera retailer to try before you bugy .
my wife and i love this camera and the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is that we have had some reliability issues with the camera body , lens and the lexar flash card we bought our original camera body died shortly after the kit lens started making a clicking noise  .
luckily we bought it from a repudible camera store that swapped out the bad body and lens for a good one  .
that is the bad and do not let that stop you from getting this camera  .
canon's tech support is great in helping us out and we still love our camera even with the problems we've had and as far as we know we are the only one's that have had problems with it the controls are not easily figured out but can be adjusted quickly if you study the book and get used to using the shortcuts  .
it powers on almost instantly , and is great for traveling  .
i am not a professional photographer but i use a lot of different digital p s and slr cameras where i work and the rebel xt and 20d are my favorites  .
our purchase due to money is narrowed down to the xt and the nikon d70  .
we bought the xt because we love canon's , it's lighter , it's seems to be faster , is a lot more fun to use and it is 8mp instead of 6  .
3mp  .
i have never met a person that regretted buying a canon dslr but i do know several that wished they had i've heard a lot of complaints about the grip and display size but i love the grip in fact my little finger fits below the camera and i feel that it gives me more vertical stabilization  .
as far as the display size this is one thing that you trade for the smaller size camera  .
i like to travel and hike so size is deffinitely a factor  .
battery life is also excellent with the xt  .
we have to empty our 2gig flash card several times over before we ever have to change batteries  .
we just got back from a 10 day vacation taking a lot of photos and we had to swap batteries on the 9th day of our trip  .
that all said this is a great camera for the money .
i bought this camera for my wedding  .
i trained the person who took my pix the day before and nobody believes the pix were taken by a non    professional photographer  .
i also took it to my honeymoon and i could not be happier with the results  .
visit my photo    blog and you will be able to see the difference from my other cameras ( canon s40 , minolta dimage xt , canon a300)http  //212pix  .
blogspot  .
com/  .
my first dslr camera  .
i immediately see the benefits over point    and    shoot cameras (changing shutter speeds , f    stops , etc)  .
the picture quality is amazing  .
i cannot take my hands off this camera .
great camera for it's price  .
the pros far outweigh the cons  .
buy it  .
this camera is outstanding  .
it takes great pictures , and the controls are easy to use and laid out perfectly  .
start    up time is instant  .
3 pics per second in rapid    fire mode do not buy the kit with the crappy 18    55 lens  .
buy the body only and buy yourself a good is lens , either the ef 28    135 or the ef    s 17    85 .
i ordered a canon rebel xt (black) from dell on april 8 , 2005  .
they were supposed to ship it on april 25 , 2005  .
they delayed it several times    first to may 5 , then may 12 i must have called dell at least 20 times and sent them several e    mails once i called customer service and the rep transferred me to financing  .
the camera is finally shipped on may 16  .
i received the camera on may 19 but the story does not end there  .
i noticed that if i left the battery in the camera overnight or even after only 20 shots the battery would drain completely and the camera turn off i called dell to complain and is put on hold for half an hour the next call i got transferred around several departments i e    mailed them and after a couple days they told me to contact canon as they do not provide warranty support for cameras i dropped the camera at canon's repair center  .
they have replaced a pcb card and hopefully repaired it  .
i just got it back today i is shocked with my experience with dell  .
i have bought 2 pcs from dell and they have been working great my advise to all of you be careful buying cameras from dell  .
dell has terrible customer service and does not ship on time and products they ship may be re    furbished or defective buyer beware  .
if , like me , you remember your old 35mm slr fondly but have used prosumer 'digicams' for the last few years , waiting for the time when you could finally afford a first    rate d    slr , the time has finally come  .
firstly , this camera takes smooth as silk , incredibly detailed images  .
they look as good as expertly scanned 35mm film , better in many respects , and i've done a lot of scanning  .
i downloaded every sample image i could find before i bought this , yet i is still floored with the image quality of my first shots  .
if anything my expectations were exceeded secondly , being able to shoot at iso 400 with no noise , and 800 or 1600 with very little noise , cannot be undersold  .
i have taken shots at 1600 , handheld in light that is uncomfortable to read by , that are perfectly acceptable blown up to 8x10 inches  .
i have found no need to shoot at iso100 , since i cannot really tell it from iso400 and the extra shutter speed and/or smaller aperture can really come in handy  .
wow  .
a whole different ball game from a digicam third , this thing is so much more responsive than a digicam  .
fast focus , always ready to shoot , no shutter lag , huge buffer  .
the on    board flash is just fine    and like i said , i will be doing a whole lot more available    light non    flash photography with this camera  .
if you need more flash , get a hot shoe flash unit battery life is excellent  .
even with some flash and liberal shot reviewing on the lcd , i can shoot all afternoon without half draining the battery i have read a number of reviews saying the body is too small  .
rubbish  .
i felt the original rebel is too large and lumpy , and all the other semi    pro d    slr's have been neck    dragging tanks  .
i really value a compact camera for travel  .
they could go a bit smaller and it would be fine with me  .
yes it is plastic but that keeps it light , and it's not going to break  .
again , if you want a larger heavier pro body there is always the 20d , or there is the optional battery grip for the xt raw shooting is incredible  .
i have been using the free pixmantec rawshooter essentials , and the results are great  .
no more white balance issues , fantastic ability to 'fill light' , adjust exposure , balance sharpness and noice , etc  .
yet the camera can save a jpeg at the same time  .
perfect those who say that 8mp is no great advance over 6mp are right only in that it is probably not worth upgrading just for the resolution  .
however , 8mp is indeed better  .
as a former nikon guy i waited and waited for a nikon slr to compare with the canons  .
the d50 is only 6mp and not as advanced as the rebel xt (and still not for sale as of 6/8/05  .
) the d70 is too bulky for my taste and still only 6mp the kit 18    55 lens can deliver excellent images  .
if absolute corner sharpness is essential , you should shoot at f/8 or f/11 , but in all other instances you can not worry about it  .
i almost went for the 17    85 is but the kit lens is a bargain i could not pass up rated 9 because nothing is perfect  .
i am of the opinion that all digital cameras need larger lcds , like 3  .
the hangrip could use softer rubber , would go a long way towards relieving the somewhat plastic feel  .
i am sure canon and the others will improve upon the digital slr in another year  .
gilding the lilly  .
all in all    stunning .
here in south africa and i belief in europe as well this camera is called the canon eos 350d i owned a canon 300v 35mm film based camera which i sold and replaced with a fuji 602zoom  .
slr and fixed lens digitals are worlds apart  .
while my fuji is a usefull and wonderfull camera , i often got frustrated with the viewfinder lag after each shot the canon 350d is amazing as it gives you the better of both worlds slr and digital  .
i have developed an anoying habit of constantly reviewing my image result which often causes me to loose the framing moments  .
but i cannot blame the camera for this habit because one is looking through the lens with a 95% view , you tend to get what you see my recommendation , if you want to take up photography as a hobby or you just tired of those fuzzy images from point and shoot digitals , then go for this camera  .
but remember this camera is not small , so you cannot just pop it in your top pocket .
i did more research to buy this product than virtually any other of my high end tech purchases  .
my big concern is how extensive is the learning curve in the move from just add batteries and point    and    shoot to recharging , lens selection , shutter speed and all of the other intricracies confronting the slr transformation  .
i have been extraordinarily pleased with how great of a product the eos digital rebel has been and how quickly you can produce great results  .
the big advantages are a great battery life , flexibility in settings to capture different shots , shutter speed and cool factor       all of which counter balanced with bulk the start up manual for me is extremely intuitive and had me up and running in no time  .
the results have been high res pictures that have gotten me accolades from the experts on flickr , go figure  .
i am already shopping for a new lens as the one in the kit has its limitations but does do the trick for starting out now , to learn some of the more advanced functions the possibilities seem endless .
i started shopping for a digital slr when my first son turned six months old  .
other digital cameras were not fast enough to capture those special moments  .
when i started my search for an afforable quality digital slr i is leaning towards the nikon d70 (also a great choice)  .
what changed my mind  .
well my friends who are professional and amateur photographers felt that canon offered some advantages for me  .
i do not want to start a canon vs  .
nikon war  .
nikon is different and has its own advantages over canon  .
so if you have decided that the features and benefits of a canon are important to you , this is why i purchased the canon rebel xt over the canon 20d price  .
the rebel xt offered all of the features i needed for $500 less  .
it is quick enough 3 frames/second , my finger cannot take pictures much faster  .
the optional lenses are the same for rebel xt and 20d  .
optional is (image stabilization) lenses offer a sharper picture without a tripod  .
this is a very good thing when toting a diaper bag and a stroller  .
amateurs will definitely upgrade the lens or use there existing canon lenses  .
it is insane to think that the $100 ef    s 18    55/3  .
5    5  .
6 that is included in the canon rebel xt or 20 d will work like a $1000 l series lens  .
(top of the line  .
sense i saved $500 dollars on buying the rebel xt over 20d , i can immediately buy i better lens  .
some examples of lenses i like   the ef    s 17    85mm f/4    5  .
6 is usm is around $600 and the similar ef 28    135/3  .
5    5  .
6 is usm on a 35mm body    ef 28    135 sells for only $400 finally , i preformed unscientific test  .
i took a 20d and the rebel xt (used the same lens , settings , compact flash card , and a tripod) and took some pictures  .
with the help of my friends we did not see a difference between the picture quality of xt and 20d in 8 x 10 prints  .
i am a beginner and not an expert photographer ; however the canon rebel xt does what i need it to  .

update  .
in    depth review on the canon rebel xt update  .
i just saw dpreview posted in    depth review on the canon rebel xt (350) as of april 6th  .
dp reviews conclusion is very similar to my unscientific testing  .
one added note , dpreview compared the burst speeds of the d70 , canon rebel xt , and canon rebel  .
the speeds of the nikon d70 and canon rebel xt were essentially the same  .
if you would like to check out this 29 page in    depth review you can find it at http  //www  .

com/reviews/canoneos350d/  .
camera is great and easy to use  .
if you liked the last digital rebel , you will love this one size  .
weight  .
one touch print that syncs camera with printer button to switch from single shot , series shot and timer more megapix  .
height   i have large hands and my pinky hangs off the bottom flash control   no quick key to bump up the flash power when you need extra  .
(you have to go through the menu , not horrible , but annoying)  .
over all i love the camea  .
i will be buying the battery add    on not due to low power , only to extent he body for more comfort i love the camea and the cons are only an issure if you do constant shooting in a short amount of time an upgrade worth getting .
i've just had the camara for a few days but am extremely happy with it  .
it is digital photography like it used to be with an slr and film  .
and no appreciable shutter lag  .
ahot 70+ pix at my daughter's graduation and the 18    55 and 75    300 both performed well i gave it a nine 'cause that's the highest i could without giving a 10 and i have not had it long enough to give it a ten .
this is the best dslr proconsumer out on the market so far  .
produce beautiful pic in a total darkness room  .
the purpose of the plastic cover is to reduce the weight and to carry around more easier  .
what more important is the quality of the pic , the start up time , etc  .
this camera has it all  .
please remember , nothing in this world is perfect and pleased by everyone  .
be more ojective when you are rating thing .
i'm sold  .
kit lens way better than you should expect for $100  .
i'll rep ; ace it , tho , when the right one comes along .
i have been using a canon powershot g3 for a couple of years and it is a great camera , but i is outgrowing it and i decided to make the jump to slrs  .
the two cameras that immediately jumped at me were the rebel xt and the nikon d70  .
the nikon has a good feel to it , but the technology is a little old and its resolution is only about 6 mp compared to the 8 mp on the xt  .
the small size of the xt weirded me out the first time i picked it up , but it really is not that much different in size to a film slr and i became comfortable with it the more i handled it in stores the digic i processor on the g3 produced awesome shots and i is a big fan of it  .
the digic ii has not disappointed me  .
the images are brilliant the xt also boots up in an instant  .
i have not missed a shot because the camera didn't turn on in time the digital xt's top shutter speed of 1/4000 is plenty to catch most action shots and the 3  .
0 frames per second (fps) continuous shooting is great  .
i can capture up to 9 frames in one burst using the large size and fine resolution file size the only real problem that i have had with the camera is that i will occasionally hit the shutter release timer button by accident  .
while the design might be better , you could also argue that the user should pay more attention to what he is doing  .
it's certainly not annoying enough to consider returning the camera though in short , digital rebel xt is a great camera  .
you cannot find another camera with a similar feature set for this amount of money  .
the only reason i would recommend the nikon d70 over the xt is if you already have a bunch of nikon lenses  .
otherwise , i do not think you can get a better camera for the money .
the size of the camera will be a constant point of debate for this camera  .
canon had to strike a compromise between making it small enough for portability , and large enough to be comfortable to hold  .
i have average size hands and its perfect size for me  .
if you learn to hold this camera like you are supposed to , with most of the weight in your left hand at the base of the lens , you will find it infinitely more comfortable  .
problem is most users that come from p s (point shoot) cameras are used to supporting the camera weight in their right hand  .
this is not how you hold an slr the image quality is amazing out of this camera  .
it supports both jpg and raw in canon's new cr2 format  .
the # of software programs that can read this format are limited at this time , but there are enough to get by  .
in the next 6 months , you will see a landslide of program updates to support it since this camera is so popular if you are a amateur switching over to an digital slr for the first time , have no fear  .
the jpg quality out of the camera is amazing  .
as you get better in your photo taking , you should switch to raw format and use photoshop (or something equivalent) to tweak your images (the cheaper photoshop elements will work too and is the most cost effective software) when buying this camera , you have 3 choices   (1) body only , (2) body + 18    55mm lens or (3) body + 17    85mm is lens i recommend getting the kit with the 18    55mm lens since you are only paying $100 premium over the body only , and the 18    55mm lens is well worth $100  .
use this lens to discover what type of shooting you like to do and buy the specific lens that you need after that  .
no one lens will suit everyone       it is a personal choice .
i purchased this camera as a light weight alternative and back up to my canon 20d and it does that in spades  .
it is an awsome camera with great performance for the price  .
it is a little small for my large hands so i purchased the battery grip to make it more comfortable  .
my only gripe is that it uses a smaller battery than the 20d so i have to carry different batteries and chargers  .
as of now canon does not offer a charger that will charge two rebel xt batteries (for the battery grip) so i have to charge one at a time  .
are you listening canon  .
+ quick start up  .
+ high frame rate  .
+ compatible with most eos equipment  .
+ excellent picture quality  .
+/    small camera (depends on your preferences)  .
lcd screen could be brighter  .
plastic body  .
its a good entry level dslr which works perfectly in all type of light settings  .
performance at higher isos (upto 800) is very good/clean with minimum grain  .
once combined with a canon is lens it takes ideal photos .
overall , i am really happy with this purchase  .
with some research i have picked out some new (fairly inexpensive) lenses to add to my collection  .
do expect to add lenses fairly soon when you purchase this camera since you will outgrow the kit lens quickly .
me ofreen esta camara con el lente normal mas un 55/200 mas el maletin mas la bateria mas el argador mas memoria de 1 giga por 650 dolares es buen precio  .
o me quedo con la canon a620 urgente alguien que me diga  .
i love this camera , but the only thing that i found is that when i'm taking pictures inside a place the pictures are dark , i do not know if is me that i'm doing something wrong , other than that the camera is great  .
really fast and the light weight is the best  .
if somebody have some tips for me i would appreciated them thanks  .
i purchased the rebel xt with kit lens as my entry from film to digital slr's  .
the rebel xt had excellent reviews and i is impressed by it's features when viewing it at a local camera shop  .
it is small and i like this , even though many others do not  .
it makes it easier to carry around on hiking trips and etc i have quite a few lenses , but i tend to perfer the kit lens for most of my shooting  .
for the price , it's not a bad lens and when used in the right way , the barrel distortion is not noticable the biggest downfall i've found to this camera is it's high noise levels above 400 iso  .
even though cnet said it is manageable , when shooting in low light conditions such as covering indoor church events etc  .
, the noise is unacceptably high and if enlarged prints such as 8x10 and above at 400    1600 iso are the targeted print size , then you're in for a disappointment  .
i've seen alot of pictures done at high iso speeds with the 20d and it performs much better  .
i wished i would've spent the extra on the 20d for this reason but for the price of the xt , you cannot really beat it  .
it's an excellent entry    level dslr , but if i were trying to go pro , go with at least the 20d example pictures can be found at www  .
rightanglepro  .
com , as every picture on there is taken with the xt .
has anyone else seen this  .
my light meter will not change at times  .
i reboot a few times and then it starts to work (at times) .
the rebel xt is my first digital camera  .
it has everything i wanted and more  .
the manual is really small but packed with everything you need to learn about the camera  .
it is small and light but thats not a big problem for me  .
the only thing i am dissopointed in is the lense  .
if you buy this camera you will be happy with it unless you are a stupid older guy that doesnt read the directions  .
if you have a problem it will surely be answerd by looking in the manual or going on canons websight  .
since this camera is my first one im only going to give it an eight cause i dont know any others  .
this camera has never let me down  .
the digital rebel xt body benefits from being combined with the sharper and more versatile 17    85 lens  .
in high    contrast situations exposure reduction is a must  .
however , the camera will produce highly detailed super b size photos  .
even at iso 1600 the camera can produce files suitable for such enlargement , particularly if cleaned up with a product like noise ninja  .
i is frankly amazed at the quality this little camera is capable of , although photoshop manipulation is required to bring out best contrast , color and perceived resolution  .
the quality of the jpegs is not too far from what can be obtained from shooting in raw , which can be used to conserve of memory  .
the depth of field setting is quite useful and can be used to avoid manual operation in many cases  .
contrary to some reviews , the controls are not at all hard to master ; they just take a little practice and awareness  .
however , the menus are difficult or impossible to see in bright sunlight  .
imho , this inconvenience is outweighed by the small size of the camera that makes it ideal for a travel camera for those who want the quality and versatility of a dslr , but are unwilling to lug around a behemoth .
this is a great camera with a lot of bang for the buck  .
you cannot compare this camera to the 10d , 20d or 5d  .
each has its intended audience  .
this is a very capable camera with great output  .
the 8mp sensor makes elarging images for large print sizes easy my only dislike is the menu system  .
it takes multiple commands to do something that should take only one or two button presses    like changing iso levels i purchsed the battery grip to make the camera fit my hand better , the same thing i did with the 10d  .
i dont have large hands , but find it distracting to have my pinkey hanging over the end of the camera  .
if you use the 350d casualy , the battery will last you several weeks on one charge i find this camera to be a great addition to my bag , working well as a backup for my 10d and daily shooter .
i bought my first digital rebel two years ago at best buy  .
i enjoy attending airshows where i shoot hundreds of shots a day  .
the old rebel is not up to the task with a small buffer and a shutter that failed  .
best buy honored their extended warranty and replaced my 300d with the new rebel xt  .
i is able to use the bp    511 batteries from the original rebel with my 20d  .
the bg    e1 battery grip became an orphan and had to be sold on ebay  .
the rebel xt uses different batteries and a new grip i use the xt as a backup to my 20d , but there are many times when i will leave the 20d home and take out the lighter rebel  .
the image quality is the same as the 20d  .
i will lend the camera to friends and show them how to select the automatic modes , and they are delighted with the pictures they get  .
if you want to go for advanced shots , it takes a little time to learn how to navigate the buttons and menus , but it is not hard  .
the camera is not durable enough for a pro photographer , but will suit the average consumer well .
let me first start by saying until this camera , i've never used small format camera's so that colors my opinions somewhat  .
i'm not used to automated photography  .
i'm used to shutters in the lense and not in the focal plane first , i very much like the auto focus with a little practice and reading the manual , i've learn to trust the af mode i never thought that would happen this is a camera that my wife learned to use in the full auto mode right away this camera can be as simple or complex as needed for the person using it  .
full auto outdoors is a breeze for my wife and the auto flash for indoors delivers acceptable results (though at modest distances)  .
for a knowledgeable photographer though i think setting aperture/shutter speed from the main wheel is a pain in the backside another plus is auto focus is very very quiet almost no sound  .
i have big hands and have hit the button that controls the single/multi shot mode  .
but i think i've cleared that up i really hate that there is no spot meter  .
i use a grey card to determine exposures in my portrait shots spot would be a big help i spite of the fact that i do not care much for automated photography i love this camera i love working with it's raw images in photoshop  .
this camera though not perfect is a great value for the dollar  .
bought in the uk a couple of months ago for prosumer use as i needed something light and easy to use for some jobs  .
buy body only ; the 'kit' lens is dire  .
using decent lenses the performance is better than anticipated , with excellent resolution and clean colour saturation  .
body feels a bit lightweight and time will tell how it stands up to being thrown about , but nothing has broken so far  .
looked at all the competition and think this stands out as far and away the best in price range .
realy easy to set up and use  .
took 1000+ shots first couple days after i got it  .
battery life is excellent  .
the camera is very fast , it is ready to use immediately after you turn it on image quality is very good , but not as good as i expected  .
the sensor noise is noticable at iso 800+  .
the built in flash is marginal  .
however , with my external flash the output is superb .
this camera is small and if you are used to a film slr it takes a short time to adjust to holding this  .
however , the saving in weight is good (since lugging around my eos 30 film slr on a full day of treking killed my shoulder)  .
as far as the build quaity goes i have the black model which to me seemed fine  .
i bought the eos 350d (xt rebel) because the differences between the eos 20d and the eos 350d could not justify the $600 difference in cost  .
i actually find the weight saving a big advance for the eos 350d over the eos 20d  .
i have tried my previous lenses on the camera which are the sigma 28    135 macro and the sigma 70    300 apo dl macro lenses and did not find any incompatibilites  .
my lenses were bought in 2001 and 2002 but older sigma lenses may have a problem  .
i would not call this a professional backup camera since most professionals would not use the apc sensor but use a full size 35mm sensor  .
the difference in sensor size means that you have to multiply the focal length of the lens by 1  .
6 to get a 35mm focal length i general i am very pleased with this camera and the results that i have from the pictures .
when my capable sony dsc    h1 could not handle the low    light action of a rodeo , i had to scratch the itch for the speed and flexibility of an slr  .
but it is clear i will not get my money's worth until i improve my rough understanding of how iso , aperture and shutter work together and learn to set them up , quickly  .
truth is , the sony takes superior auto    mode photos , especially in close    up and macro  .
the canon improves distant shots  .
while the canon auto    modes are generally okay , the difference is meaningful , demanding one have a clear idea of how to shoot in manual modes  .
it will solve the action shot issues , but i'm not certain the average bear will be happy unless s/he hibernates the winter with the manual to learn how it really works  .
i looked hard at the nikon d40 , opting for the canon based on very ever    so    slightly better reviews and a better bundled package  .
whether or not it's a better camera is hard to say  .
if you need the benefit of an slr's speed , think about renting your top picks , first  .
even an entry level slr is a very expensive incremental improvement over a well    featured point    and    shoot  .
but there are some things an slr can do , the pns cannot .
cnet failed to mention anything about taking video with this camera  .
shame on the reviewer for this .
after a few months of reseaching digital cameras , the digital rebel xt is top on my list to purchase , until i actually held and used the camera  .
mind you , the in camera processing of pictures is excellent , very similar to a point and shoot , but when you actually pick up the camera and try to hold it , its very disappointing if you are an average to large size man , you will have a problem holding on to this thing as it is very small  .
half of my hand hangs off the bottom of the grip , and i don't want to have to buy a battery grip for another $150 bucks just so i can hold on to it  .
i'm not sure what canon is thinking here , as the original digital rebel is not like this , and their primary target customer is a man  .
furthermore , the plastic body seems sturdy , but if you give it a little squeeze , it creaks , especially around the door areas  .
i can only imagine how it would or wouldn't hold up if you were constantly traveling with it  .
i woudn't spend $900 on a camera and know that it might not be durable the menus are also tabbed out instead of a constant scroll which is also a little annoying and makes it harder to naviate other than that , the in camera imagery is great , and produces some very detailed pictures  .
i haven't seen the camera produce in raw format , which really tells the story  .
the camera relies heavily on in camera processing of images , so i'm not sure how this holds out in terms of blown out prints which cannot be recovered in post processing overall , for a beginner or amatuer photographer , the camera is great if you can get by the feel and construction of the camera  .
i could not but that's just me  .
the nikon cameras have a much heavier feel , better construction , and the best post processing of photos around .
i use this camera alongside my film based contax g2 , which i have always liked for it's ability to focus in almost complete darkness  .
the canon will do this , but only with that terrible af    assist light  .
why not use infrared instead  .
what i do like about the 350d/rebel xt is it's compactness , it doesn't take up that much space in the gearbag  .
with the batterygrip it can use several different sources of power (rechargeable/regular penlites or two 720mah batteries) and because the standard batterylife ai not that great (150 pics or so) i would recommend it image quality is an improvement over my old canon powershot g5 , mainly because of better lens options , but 8mp helps a great deal  .
would have preffered that canon kept the battery from the previous rebel , since it is interchangeable with that of my g5 .
i love the camera but i really wish i had just gotten the body (without the kit lens)  .
do yourself a favor and research lenses before you buy  .
in a very exhaustive survey of several hundred lenses canon's 18    55 is near the very bottom  .
canon , sigma and tamron all have better choiced , depending on your shooting style .
cnet's review for the xt is a little biased and they have missed a few facts like    .
the white balance is pathetic , especially under incandescent light    absolutely no improvements over the rebel 300 2  .
as with the rebel 300 , many of your shots get over exposed by default  .
i have consistently been able to reproduce this problem with the rebel 300 and the rebel 350 3  .
sharpening algorithm looks almost same as what is used in the compact powershot models 4  .
no spot metering    is this a hugely complex thing to incorporate  .
canon responds to most complaints by well , you have options to do things manually  .
but at the same time , they leave out spot metering which is by far the most dependable manual feature when doing macro photography this camera may be light weight and cute and all  .
but when it comes to taking pictures for a wide variety of scenarios , the nikon d70 really does a better job cnet's rating of 8  .
0 seems inaccurate and bloated up  .
will cost people dissappointment for sure and i do not work for either nikon or canon .
i really wanted to like this camera a whole lot  .
it's certainly a great dslr , but the plastic grip is just too small  .
with a decent sized lens , i thought the grip is too small the camera body too light for it to be comfortable to hold for any length of time  .
the eos 20d is a better option for me , and i think that i have average sized hands  .
i really recommend going to a store and trying out the camera to ensure that the grip is not too small for you .
this camera has been a disappointment for me from day one  .
the photos it produces straight from the camera are nothing short of ugly  .
too soft and lacking any saturation even with the settings turned up  .
my preference is a nice punchy , crisp image and no amount of editing seemed to get me results i is happy with my second biggest qualm is the autofocusing  .
bearing in mind that this is a relatively cheap dslr , i still expected better  .
i shoot mostly bird photos and love to do flight shots  .
the ai servo feature which is supposed to track moving subjects is next to useless  .
just was not up to the task  .
why have this feature on the camera if it does not perform reasonably well  .
i'm not alone on this , another experienced bird shooter told me exactly the same  .
autofocus is also poor in lowlight and tends to hunt the build quality is poor as everyone can attest to (feels hollow)  .
the handgrip far too small to maintain a firm grip on the camera  .
the lcd is too small and lacks clarity for outdoor viewing there are also many small niggling issues but i hope the main thing people understand is this is not a good camera if your serious about your photography i am uncertain at this point whether i will upgrade to another canon (as i love my 400 5  .
6 l lens) or switch to another brand  .
a friend i know uses the pentax k10d and she gets beautiful punchy , crisp images i would recommend people steer clear of this camera especially if you like nice photos without a lot of editing .
i have used the canon ae1 slr and g2 models and their high quality promted me to buy the rebel xt  .
i found that the construction quality in the xt is poor in comparison to my previous canons  .
there is no protection for the lcd screen as found in my g2 , a plasic body and most of all poor holding ability ie   no grip on one side and is a problem if you have large hands  .
the lens supplied with the camera is nothing to write home about  .
fortunatly it does take great pictures and has a good response time which is it's main good feature but i would look at other brands of cameras in any future purchases .
i bought my camera on a sunday and is taking tons of pictures to test it out  .
on monday , i took some pictures with a lot of blue sky in them  .
i noticed a spot that is darker its their surroundings  .
experimenting , i found that taking a picture with just blue sky revealed several of these spots  .
i followed the instructions in the manual for cleaning the sensor (twice) to no avail  .
i ended up returning the camera less than 24 hours after i bought it  .
i now know why olympus has sensor cleaners built into their cameras  .
i am probably going to just get a camera with a fixed lens and no opportunity for dirt to get on the sensor  .
i really do not think i got the dirt/dust on the sensor because as soon as i took the cover off the body , i put the lens on , and i is not in a dirty environment .
after much deliberation and research , i finally purchased a canon e350d camera on 22 july 2005  .
apparently the camera i purchased is one of a batch of 20 000 cameras that have a general fault reading any compact flash card  .
upon returning the camera to the retailer (on monday the 25 july 2005) , who tested it and found the same problem , they contacted canon south africa  .
as per the conversation with between the retailer and canon , the above is revealed to ourselves  .
canon said that i would have a replacement camera within the week  .
it is now 11 days later and i still do not have my camera nor any indication of when i might get it back .
feature for feature , this camera is average among 8mp prosumer slr's  .
it is good , but in its category , the rebel xt does not perform materially better than others  .
it has not substantially improved on the rebel  .
getting an 8mp for the same price as the 6  .
3mp rebel just a few months ago is great , but the camera does not seem to be all that and more that it is cracked up to be .
i is not impressed by this model/unit maybe my expectations were too high i compared it with other cameras of lower quality/prices , and is disapointed with the overall results few pics were ok , but most came out in fair/poor quality the software provided is great at improving most/some the camera itself is too picky/fragile under almost all conditions , time consuming even on auto mode  .
in my opinion this camera is way over priced the following accessories should all be inclusive in the price , a tripod is a must /extralens/cleaning kit/1 gb of mem/ac dc adaptor/underwater package/heavy duty hi    impact plastic casing/hd seals / batteries/cf/sd/xd/ms compatible memory/more pixels/a big bag or case/a rubber chicken perhaps then i might/would consider purchasing it for myself to use in a nice place way/fashion butterflies , birds , breeze , rich and retired lalala no combatmissions diving hi altitude/ drops/ snowstorms/ blizzards/ sandstorms/ shockwaves/ or just resting or camping in the arctic or desert for this baby  .
our first rebel lasted 8 days and the 2nd one 15 , cuz we did not use it the first 8  .
sand is the culprit in both camera failures  .
(it is not that bad all the other cameras still work fine even after repeat usage and cleaning them with windex) but most importantly in all of this the rebel did not live up to its name it implied to the average person under similar conditions as the much cheaper counter parts used as comparison in this live test in the field worst is that , a cheap 200$ camera will withstand almost anything thrown at it and still be able to at least take pictures when/if going back home in one piece  .
thats my 2 cents on it  .
canon , take note for 900$ we expect better quality then fair/poor  .
my powershota75 still works marvelously after 3 yrs of rough treatment these rebels lived hard and died young leaving us very few good memories  .
(wink)  .
should have been , could have been , definatly is not i'm a professional photographer and use any one of about 15 different digital cameras for work , and have owned maybe 30 or 40 different digital cameras in the last 10 years or so and the digital rebel definately does not mesure up to anything first the positive  .
the camera has a good start up time , great battery life , fast accurate auto    focus (in decent light) and just ''feels'' good  .
and it's relativly cheap anybody used to shooting slr's will feel right at home with it  .
and of course it works with all the canon eos lenses , batteries flashes , which are all fairly affordable  .
now the bad  .
first of all the camera always shoots everything under exposed  .
the f    stop is consistantly about a half or a full f    stop off what it should be so you have to either retouch (brighten) every single picture you take , or set the f    stop manually if you want good pictures  .
and no , i'm not retentive about the quality of the images , the camera is really that bad how come the $260 canon a540 i got my kid for christmass can do it right , but my $999 digital rebel cannot  .
secondly the electronics in the digital rebels have a real problem talking to the flashes  .
i've tried my speedligh 220 , 440 550 (built by canon) and a sunpack flash for canon's , and get identical results using all 4  .
this camera simply does not take correctly exposed shots using a flash  .
period  .
some are bright , some are dark , and some are just plain flashed out with about 70 billion gigawatts of light  .
and they just plain don't work at all unless your at least 6    7 feet away from your subject it is the worse control of an external flash that i've ever experienced on any camera , bar none conversly , the internal little pop up flash actually works pretty good , as long as you have some light  .
in very low or no light situations it does some kind of stroboscopic little dance , then pops off a flash about a second later  .
very weird and kind of hard to work with and last , but worst of all this camera has a design flaw one day while in the middle of shooting a burst of pictures the autofocus simply stopped working  .
i have another friend that has the exact same problem  .
did some research over the net and found that we're hardly the only ones that this has happened to  .
as a matter of fact i counted well over a dozen digital rebel owners that had the exact same problem on that message board it's a design flaw , where one of the parts inside the camera simply cannot stand up to the wear tear of taking too many pictures  .
some camera huh  .
a small pin that flips the mirror breaks , and prevents the camera from fine tuning the micro    focus on the image i called canon , who told me that i could send them the camera get it fixed for a few hundred dollars  .
great  .
let me get this right canon makes a camera that actually breaks when you take pictures with it , and then they offer to charge me a third of the price of the camera to fix it  .
according to the person i spoke with their is no recall on this product , they are not aware of any design flaws , and cannot explain why it broke  .
maybe i did something wrong  .
like shooting pictures with it  .
do not buy this camera , chip in a few hundred $$ more and buy something else hope this helps you out .
i always had sony until i sold my sony v1 and got the rebel xt  .
i is not impressed and it is not to my espectation  .
specially the kit lens is rubish  .
i bought couple of more expensive lenses but still could not get what expected for the money  .
build quality is really bad  .
the black plastic body looks like a toy  .
specially because i is used to sony's high buld quality how much would it cost canon to use a better material  .
i dont think that much  .
i switched back to sony again and wont ever come back  .
i bought a r1 and image quality i can get is really better  .
i know r1 is not dslr and lens is fixed but at least i can get the quality i want from this one lens  .
i think image quality is the most important factor  .
