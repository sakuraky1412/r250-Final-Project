we only stayed here one night but it was a special stay .
i proposed to my girlfriend at the ritz carlton battery park and the level of genuine care and organizing of the moment by the staff involved was spectacular and truly amazing .
the general manager met us and the various area managers were all there to ensure we had the best stay and were taken care of the entire way .
mayra was there from a month before my stay to ensure every detail was taken care of and she even offered her cell phone to make sure i was comfortable and understood what was happening along the way .
abdel was the first manager i met at the hotel and he ensured i felt at home and was truly taken care of in every aspect while staying at the property .
laura at the front desk was also exceptional and genuine with care , manny the restaurant manager ensured we had a great table and reservations were made for us .
carlos at the concierge desk also booked a fabulous dinner for us at a thai restaurant in soho .
jonathan took us to the private rooftop area which gave us a spectacular view of the waterfront and was a great unobstructed view - super cool !
so many people involved and they all take a special interest in there guests .
since i was proposing it was of course nice that we received the best . . .

since i was proposing it was of course nice that we received the best possible service but i could tell that they do not just do this for proposals - they seem to be this way with every single client that stays which is remarkable and i will never forget the top notch service we received from this hotel .
thank you ritz battery park for undoubtedly the best stay i have ever had at a hotel property anywhere.
