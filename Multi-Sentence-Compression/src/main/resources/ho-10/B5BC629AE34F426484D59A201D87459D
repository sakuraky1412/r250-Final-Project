here are a few instances within our few days there : - my wife and i were planning to eat food we 'd purchased elsewhere in our room , so we asked for a small cup or plate of ketchup , but the staff refused stating we can not leave the lounge with food- when eating some pre-dinner snacks around 5:30 pm , we were told we had to leave the lounge with our baby ( 9 months ) because they were serving alcohol 5-10 pm .
