Pros:. The setup is super easy. After owning this system for almost a year, it continues to be trouble free, easy to use, and provides superior quality video.. 
Cons:. For the price, nothing! I've more than paid for it just not having to pay for cable TV for almost a year now.. 
Summary:. It's like having Blu Ray player connected to a fully adjustable 7.1 audio receiver, a wireless computer to watch YouTube videos, Netflix, and several other streaming options, and the streaming is excellent. Movies download more seamlessly using the BD390 than on my computer, and in HD too! I get TV shows, movies, and for like $9 a month to pay for the Netflix subscription. I've actually quit buying regular cable and just watch a TV show on Netflix whenever I have time, knowing I will only have to watch the show with no advertisements or having to flip through channels. Love it!.

Pros:. Wireless N, fast load time, can view pictures from home network, nice user interface, lots of extra features. 
Cons:. Can't disable autoplay when you power on. 
Summary:. I wanted a blu-ray player, and was interested in the Netflix instant option that many offer. My home has the router set up in the basement, so I invested in a terrific wireless N router (Belkin's N+ -highly recommended). If I was going to connect to the network, it would have to be wireless, but very few that have wireless N capability. The LG BD390 gives you great picture plus fast streaming of all the online content. I purchased this player after doing lots of research, and it was almost like getting two devices in one.. First, it performs it's primary function superbly: Blu-ray movies look amazing and dvds are upconverted nicely.. Second, the wireless connection allows me to stream all the content from Youtube, Netflix, Vudu, etc., right to my TV through my home theater. No more trying to watch instant content on my laptop with the tiny speakers and the small screen sitting on my lap. Now, with one device, I can watch so many instant movies and shows right from my best equipment.. If you have an ethernet cable running to the back of your TV or if you don't care about internet/network/instant access, then there are cheaper options for blu-ray players. But if you are like me and can't run a cable from the basement to the TV, then the wireless N option is the way to go.. A small drawback is the player always starts playing the disc if there is one in the tray when you power it on, which is a small gripe, but still a bit annoying.. Otherwise, it is better than I could have hoped when I did all my research, and it really makes watching movies and instant content easy and fun..

Pros:. Great on screen menu. This thing is a beast, very well built. My wife smash this player on the ground twice and it still works.. 
Cons:. Nothing to not like.. 
Summary:. Great picture quality, great online features. I have nothing bad to say about this player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick loading, DVDs look great, Blu-ray looks awesome, love the connectivity.. 
Cons:. Price is pretty high however, I scored this for less than what I paid for the BD370 through a special sale at my local retailer, a pro within a con.. 
Summary:. I've had this player for about a month and haven't yet explored the bonus features of this product (wifi), I'm looking to get set up there soon. What I've been able to do with this player so far, I think is pretty cool. You may laugh at what I've accomplished so far but it's working for now.. I've been shopping like crazy for a home theatre system within a modest budget to accommodate my 42" LCD. I feel I've scored, my purchase: Onkyo TX-NR807 and SKS-HT870.. What I've been living with, I have an old (15yr old) Fisher CD player boom box with detachable speakers, two Sony bookshelf speakers plugged into the surround out put on the Fisher and the Fisher unit is plugged into the audio analogue input on the back of the BD390.. The BD390 also has a 7.1 analogue input on the back and I have an Energy 200W sub woofer connected to the "SW" input on the back.. It's total Frankenstein but the BD390 has actually allowed me to run a pseudo 4.1 speaker system. Of course, when the TX-NR807 shows up, the BD390 can relax, but for now, it's doing a great job.. My fiancee thinks it's theatre quality (hardly, but still pretty good), wait till she gets a taste of the Onkyo.. Updated. on Mar 26, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Built-in wi-fi (no dongles or add-ons) blows the competition away. Picture quality is excellent on my Vizio 1080p TV - don't know why the other reviewer couldn't get it to work on his with HDMI. Netflix, Cinema Now, Vudu, plus home media server.... 
Cons:. Needs Amazon VOD capability, backlit remote would be nice (but definitely not a show-stopper.. 
Summary:. Got this player for Christmas, and used it every day since. I have it connected to a Vizio 1080p TV via HDMI, picture is fantastic. caseblue's review states that HDMI didn't work with his/her Vizio - my guess is that either the TV or the player has a defect, doubt that it's an issue with the TV or player being 'incompatible'.. I've used the player more for streaming than playing discs, but BluRay discs are outstanding, and DVD looks better than my old DVD player ever did...nice upconversion. I'm connected using the built-in wi-fi to my wireless G network, with 3Mbps DSL - streaming quality is very good, even at those speeds. Vudu offers full 1080p *HDX) streaming, but with my connection speed, I get a lot of pauses. Works well at regular SD or HD resolutions, though - may try upgrading to 6Mbps DSL and see if that helps. Could be the wireless, too - ethernet connection might solve the problem. Overall, I'm extremely happy with this player - Amazon VOD is about the only thing I'd add to it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick, Streams Netflix and Youtube and other services, High quality streaming, networks with your computer, easy to use, ethernet and wifi onboard. 
Cons:. **(ONLY MINOR CONS)**Does not yet stream from any music services, remote control would be better with qwerty keyboard for youtube searching. Not Ipod ready.. 
Summary:. This is the perfect BluRay player. A lot people are buying the samsung bluray players, and when they update firmware, they freeze or services stop working. Other problems have occured as well. This one is worth the money. It has superior output quality. If you have a netflix account, this is the perfect unit for that. As long as your connection is fast streaming movies at 1080i is great at both quality and speed. Ive been told the XBOX360 buffers faster than this unit, but I think this is fast enough. Connect unit to router and it automatically obtains an ip address, and is ready to stream. Unit also has preinstalled wifi adapter to connect to wireless routers. It updates once conected and still works. Plus updates bring new services.Using youtube searching sucks because you have to jump to the letter using the arrow buttons. Has HDMI and component video outputs, and 7.1, optical and digital coax(SPDIF) audio outputs, as well as analog a/v outputs for older equipment. Comes with Nero software only for connecting to computer network. Once installed and running the program, when the unit is restarted, to connect to the network, stop and re start up server in the nero program on your computer, then the bluray unit will see your computer on the network. In the settings you choose a folder from computer for sharing over the network, and whatever is in it will be accessible on the blura1y unit. Photos, videos, movies, music. The same thing can be done using a thumb drive connected the front USB port. Ipods work too, but all music is unorganized stored in coded folders using coded file names. Basically will play 15 random songs per folder. This Bluray player is better than most of the others. Looks great on my plasma at 1080p. I am very satisfied. I only like and want the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick Power-on. Superfast load times of standard and Blu Ray discs. Beautiful, easy to use interface. You Tube interface is fantastic and much more usable than you would think.. Built-in Wireless N! Works Great! Look Ma...no wires!. 
Cons:. No Amazon streaming. 
Summary:. My last Blu Ray player SUCKED. I mean REALLY sucked. It was a Sony BDP-S300. Sometimes it would take up to ten minutes to load a Blu-Ray disc, and sometimes wouldn't play them at all. The LG BD390 loads and plays Blu-Ray discs as fast as any player loads standard DVDs. But DVD playback is really just icing on what is really a GREAT media player. If you've got a Netflix account you have access to thousands of hours of content. I was really skeptical about what quality I would get with my 4Mbps DSL but I watched a couple of movies completely through with absolutely no buffering or glitches of any kind. The quality was near DVD.. I didn't try the CinemaNow since the prices seemed a bit steep per view. The Vudu interface was beautiful, and although I was too cheap to rent a movie I watched quite a few of the trailers. The quality looked FANTASTIC. When I tried to access the HDX trailers I did get a couple of loading errors, most likely due to my slower connection. What was really a surprise was You Tube. It just seems so much more enjoyable watching the You Tube content with the beautiful and elegant LG interface. It starts with a small window on left and description on right. One button brings it immediately full screen. I'm watching this on a 109" projection and you'd think the content would look terrible, and some of it does, but much of it, especially the HQ stuff, looks VERY watchable.. Why buy a Blu Ray player and a seperate media streaming device when you can have both in one! I honestly do not have any experience with other media streamers but I can't imagine they can do it much better than the LG. That said, I've heard great things about the Amazon on-demand and I'm hoping the LG supports it soon.. I hope I don't get kicked off here, but a lot of the reviews were complaining about the price. I got mine for less than $260, which is $100 less than I paid for the Sony Blu-Ray when it was new and it sucks! Email me at djstatik@aol.com and I'll shoot you the link to the online store. It's not a refurb. It was brand new and got to my house in three days. :-). 

$$;
Pros:. - Up and running within 5 minutes out of the box.. - Instant access to Netflix, CinemaNow, YouTube, and more. - Wifi connection means no wires running from the office to the living room. - This thing rocks!. 
Cons:. We haven't found one thing yet that we don't like about it.. 
Summary:. If you don't need an Xbox 360 or PS3, but you still want to view online content such as Netflix, CinemaNow, YouTube or watch Blu-ray DVD's, then this is the player for you. With the built-in wi-fi connection, you can stream live internet content directly to your TV in HD or standard definition using your internet connection and wireless router. We absolutely LOVE this!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy Setup almost plug &#38; play, Built in wireless no dongle to buy or worry about. Netflix instant access to movies works great, VUDU &#38; CinemaNow also available but did not try. Firmware update is fast &#38; easy.. 
Cons:. System powers down if idle for a few minutes.. 

$$;
Pros:. Starts up fast. Excellent streaming video from Netflix. Works great with my Pioneer receiver and my Sony LCD TV.. 
Cons:. Wish they would install Hulu option with firmware upgrade.. 
Summary:. Works like a charm. Does exactly what I wanted.. 

$$;
Pros:. The ease of setup for Wi-Fi and Streaming ssetup over Netflix, You Tube, Cinema Now and Vudu.. 
Cons:. When streaming from Netflix, you should be able to setup the queue with this unit as opposed to just read only access. Perhaps a future Software Update would address this pet peeve.. 
Summary:. I simply cannot believe that others out there had challenges in setting this unit up to access the internet. People, it's really not that difficult, even for someone with perhaps minimal or limited knowledge of wireless internet setup. Instead of manually typing in the SSID into this unit, you should be able to use the Search module built in to this device to detect the available Networks that are bradcasting their SSID's. Once you get your SSID, just select it and you're on your way. And once you're up, I highly recommend getting the latest Software Update by simply performing the search for the latest available software out there online. With this, you will have access to streams not just from Netflix, You Tube and Cinema Now, but also from Vudu as well. In addition, this unit, provided the accesses have been granted from your Home Workgroup, can also stream Media from within your Shared Drive Space. If you are going to do this, I highly recommend you have an adeqautely higher speed internet, such as the services provided from Verizon FiOs and Comcast with a minimum of 15 mbps available. I have the 20 mbps down/5 mbps up and this works flawlessly. On occasion, if the network speed has slowed down, this would be the only time you'll experience any buffering. And the stream quality will depend upon the quality of the stream available out there in tandem with the upconversion that this unit will perform but this has been usually excellent in the two days I've had my unit.. I purchased this on Black Friday not only price matching Sears' Regular Price of $245 but also got a free Blu Ray Title with it as part of the BF Special. For those in the Dallas, TX, visit the Flower Mound, TX location and speak to Eddie T. (Ops Mgr) or Michael H. (Store GM). I highly recommend speaking with the folks at this store as they are very helpful.. Updated. on Nov 29, 2009.

Pros:. Easy set-up, great colors, excellent blacks!. 
Cons:. It wasn't free. 
Summary:. Way better than the Samsung that only has edge LEDs. 

$$;
Pros:. Hook-up: My wife would have enjoyed complaining about it being difficult to hook up. Instead literally gasped as our Netflix queue popped up.. Video Quality: I'm stunned. Slobbering. Suppressing giggles.. 
Cons:. It surely wasn't cheap. And i've only had it for a few days. If anything goes south, I'll come back and report.. 
Summary:. If you've got the cash, jump. There's nothing in here but Awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality is great.. Very responsive interface.. Netflix capable.. Built-in memory.. Network-able with Mac. 
Cons:. File setup for My Media awkward.. Haven't found way to play all folders within a folder in one click.. 
Summary:. After trying out 2 Samsung BD players and the LG 370, this unit is by far the best for my home set-up. I use Airport Express to set up my home network and had no trouble getting connected (except that I couldn't find a way to include caps in my password - had to change network password to all lower-case). The DVD up-converting is way better than with the 370, and somewhat better than the Samsungs. The remote is simple and easy for fingers to find their way around, though backlighting would be nice. Third-party UPnP (Playback) has worked fine to link my Macs to the player and have actually found that quality to be better than attaching a USB drive.. Sadly I cannot get the sound to sync with the video, which runs faster than the audio. I had the same trouble with other BD players and can't figure out where an adjustment needs to be made to get my projector and HT in sync.. Overall I'm very pleased with this and have found it much easier to work with than any Samsung players or the step-down 370..

Pros:. Excellent online functionality and home networking with included Nero MediaHome.. 
Cons:. Limited remote control range.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up. Superfast load times. Wireless connectivity. Superbly detailed 1080p image. Incredibly detailed sound. 
Cons:. I've got no complaints so far.. 
Summary:. The quality of the HD image using Blu ray disks is incomparable. But the secret weapon is the audio. My audio experience spans early monaural HiFi to Blue ray. This player is the best program source for audio that I have ever owned, bar none. Because Blu ray can fit 5 times the information of a DVD, there is no need for a compressed soundtrack. The sound is full and reveals details I've never heard before. I have a 5.1 channel set up; now I am looking at getting a 7.1 receiver and even more spectacular audio.. Where are the annoying loading times for Blu ray disks? LG has engineered the worst of the wait out of the BD390. Even with the wireless internet services it offers, with a good signal from your router the load is --again-- superfast. The services you can access include Netflix, YouTube and CinemaNow. Two days ago the player asked me if I wanted to download a firmware upgrade. I clicked yes and now I have the Vudu wireless movie service, delivering 1080p HD streaming movies and theatrical movie trailers. As the player sits in my stereo cabinet, it increases in functionality and value!. Netflix delivers for the BD390. I select instant-play movies on the Netflix site with my PC, and the BD390 displays them on my HDTV. Selecting and playing movies from the Instant Queue could not be faster or easier. I've upgraded my Netflix account to Blue ray and five disks at a time. Now, to some extent, every night is a Netflix night.. On the othr side, I am going to have to find a new income source because the BD390 has revealed flaws in my stereo system only an advanced AV receiver and speakers even more impressive than my mix of EPIs (R, L), Polk(C) and Mission (RR, RL). I also need a 300Mbps router to take full advantage of my players wireless features. Luckily, I like buying gadgets.... 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive connectivity. Took only a few minutes to connect with my router without reading instructions. Fast loading. Easy media.. 
Cons:. Remote is slow when using Netflix.. 
Summary:. Excellent. Would highly recommend. Some reviews said this was hard to set up. It couldn't have been easier.. Updated. on Jul 26, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. - Superb picture and sound quality. - Fast (for a blu-ray player). - Netflix. - You Tube. - PC streaming. 
Cons:. So far, none.....seriously.. 
Summary:. After the frustration of dealing with the Samsung BD-P3600, the LG player was just what I needed. Easy to set up and not a single glitch.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up, took about a half hour including Netflix activation. Menu is easy to use. Picture quality is great. Unit is wireless but I hard wired the internet connection and it works great.. 
Cons:. A little pricey. Spent another $100 for decent cabling. Seems like manufacturers could provide quality cabling.. 
Summary:. I initially do not anticipate renting or buying a lot of blu ray discs but I did buy one as a test of the system and the quality was nice. I bought this unit mainly because of the features and the ability to stream from Netflix. So far, that part has worked flawlessly. The only problem I have is that I also have an LG combo DVD/VCR that I still use and the remote for the BD390 also operates the DVD/VCR.. 

$$;
Pros:. bought 6 months ago, first time in years a new device knocked the ball out of the park.. much faster loading than my Sony.. It tracks where you are in watching Netflix on demand. 
Cons:. none found yet. 
Summary:. I love mine, I think you will like yours. 

$$;
Pros:. Media streaming from my NAS, Netflix on demand, great blu-ray quality. 
Cons:. Occasionally unresponsive. 
Summary:. This is my first Blu-ray player so I dont have a lot to compare it with, but I do know from my research that slugishness and other quirks are common in this still emerging technology. Blu-ray discs load in an acceptably quick fashion, though certainly not as fast as DVDs did on my old Oppo DVD player. Regardless, audio and video quality is great in Blu-ray and Netflix on-demand. No problems watching downloaded .avi files streamed from my PC via TVersity, directly from my Dlink 323 NAS (which is UPnP compatible) or streaming Netflix through my older Linksys N router (WRT150N running DD-WRT) via a Comcast 20 Mbps connection, though I have yet to try streaming a full 1080p movie via Vudu.. Network setup was a little tricky in that I had to manually specify IP and DNS instead of relying on automatic settings in order to establish a consistent wireless connection. If you have a BD390 and are having problems with staying connected, you should definitely try manually setting the IP and DNS instead of relying on your router to assign an address.. I'm really hoping Pandora may be added via firmware update but as it was not promised, its absence had no effect on this review.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast load of bd disc, excellent streaming including mkv's. Outstanding blu ray performance and DVD upscaling.. 
Cons:. doesn't support xvid format, which is odd. Ocassional quirks in how it displays pc servers, Remote control seems a bit weak power wise. No pandora.. 
Summary:. Does everything the Samsung 3600 does with minor quibbles, and does them without all the bugs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in wifi, netflix streaming, home media interface (easy setup on Windows 7), VUDU, YouTube, good controller button layout, USB port in front, design, supports all current and next gen Highdef Audio, Graphical user interface. 
Cons:. Lack of streaming video support for WMV (have to convert to avi), no Amazon onDemand. 
Summary:. I researched a ploretha of Blu-ray players before deciding on the LG BD390. My main factors were support of highdef audio, builtin wifi, and streaming capabilities. The addition of interfacing with my PC was a plus. Though the price was high in some respects, I found it for $280 after tax and shipping online. Load times exceed that of the PS3, though I have contemplated since then of whether a PS3 would have been a better way to go for the price. I don't play much games, so this also factored into my decision along with design. I was extremely please with how easy the device was to setup. Over all setup time including reinstating netflix account, and connection to PC, was right around 20 minutes. This will vary depending on your current setup.. 

$$;
Pros:. Set up was quite simple. The Quick Setup &#38; Internet Connectivity Guide worked well and I was connected to the home network in less than 10 minuites.. 
Cons:. For now, none whatsoever. Additional reviews possible depending on continued performance. 
Summary:. In addition to having an easy to understand manual, the player seems to work like a charm. I tested a standard (non HD) DVD and the picture was crisp. Although I have read complaints about the remote, it seems straight-forward, functions well and gets the job done. I also tested the strength of my wireless N by connecting to Netflix, taking advantage of their 2 week free trial. Again, others have complained but my network is strong, films play smoothly without any hiccups. Overall I would say we are off to a great start. I used Cnet Reviews and Consumer Reports as my guide to buying and do not believe I've been led wrong. The player seems excellent and I would recommend it. On day one I am willing to give it an "Outstanding" rating, subject to change as we continue to use the system. Enjoy!. 

$$;
Pros:. Wireless connectivity; easy to set-up; simple firmware updates; netflix, youtube and cinemanow; remote control is laid-out well; nice picture quality; fast load times.. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. This is my second Blu-ray and a replacement to a Sony machine that just stopped playing discs. The wireless feature is great! The firmware is easy to update from the menu and it updates through the wireless connection. Superb! Watching movies from Netflix or Cinemanow is easy and the quality has exceeded my expectation. The Youtube feature is a bonus and fun to watch music videos. I highly recommend this product!. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the quality. All sources play superb, even internet streaming from netflix subscription (already had) with the WIFI connected to cable speeds. Also simple setup and use.. 
Cons:. Price is "so so" being $250-300. I would love to pay $100 less and drop off the blue ray and get same features with DVD and WIFI. Remote is not the greatest, mostly due to annoying "door" covering the TV buttons which I will probably just remove.. 
Summary:. Wish it was cheaper, but would buy it again and would recommend it to a friend. The features including WIFI accessibility to use Netflix and CinemaNow are what makes this unit different then all the rest of the DVD/blue ray players I saw when I bought this one. One other bad thing I noticed was that the remote does not work well at an angle (say 45 degrees from midline). Excellent product though so far, and looks nice too. I give LG a "thumbs up" to the nice set of features and appearance. Overall, I would rate it 8-8.5/10 (would say 9/10 if I liked the remote better).. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up and excellent picture. I used digital audio out to old amplifier to 5.1 DTS and HDMI and wireless network. I get a very good signal with the Netgear N router.. 
Cons:. netflix audio not optimzed for sourround as far as I can tell. 
Summary:. worth the money if purchased at under 325.00.

Pros:. Very easy setup, wireless hooked up with minimal effort, very quick, nice remote. 
Cons:. no Pandora?? otherwise very pleased. 
Summary:. would highly recommend. 

$$;
Pros:. Average guy here, never posted before. PLEASE SEE MY AUDIO QUESTION IN SUMMARY THANKS.. 1. Streams Netfilix faster than the Samsung 3600.. 2. Recognized my computer, the Sams would not let me view items.. 3. Internal wi fi, Sam3600 has an external.. 
Cons:. None really discovered, but nitpicks:. 1. The remote works fine, just looks cheap...I liked the Sams3600 remote more, classier, no big deal.. 2. I liked the look of the Sams 3600 more, but LG looks great, not a real issue anyway.. 2. No Pandora.. 
Summary:. CNET was right, very close to Sams3600, I'd get the Sams if I had a Sams TV just to have continuity, but I have a Hitachi 55" HDX99, so I picked the LG for Netflix speedier streaming. I like YouTube more than Pandora, that's me, so LG's advantage over the Sams3600 again.. MY QUESTION TO SOMEONE SMARTER THAN MYSELF ABOUT AUDIO:. I have a 10 year old Onkyo 555 receiver, want to use it to save money for now. Just got the LG BluRay and some Energy 5.1 Take Classics for $329 from American(CNET reccommends them at $599 even, so I feel good about that. Also, Costco is selling the sub alone for $130 to $180 on the Energy, the same 8" sub that comes with the 5.1 Take Classic set).. My question is about the audio set up for multi channel on the LG Blu Ray. I am using the analog 7.1 out on the LG for my five speakers(leaving the last two slots empty since I don't have seven speakers) and using old monster RCA cables to connect to the Onkyo.. 1. On the LG, under "Setup", 'Audio', 'HDMI': what do I choose? PCM stereo, PCM multi ch, DTS re-encode, or Primary Pass through?. 2. Then under 'SPDIF', what do I choose? PCM stereo, DTS re-encode, or Primary Pass through?. 3. Does it matter since I am using the analog audio out and not the digitial HDMI or others, are those setting just for digital? Also, what is "SPDIF"?. 4. Does it matter what quality of cable to connect for the multi channel? Regular RCA's that come with the LG390 versus "Monster" RCA cables?. 5. Side question about speaker wire. I have to splice and add length to my monster speaker wire so I can hang the smaller Energy front speakers on my wall. Do I need to sodder the splice or just twist and use electrical tape? (I currently have tower Polks and the wire just ends into the bottom, now I have to run more wire to go behing my wall to hang the Energy's).. I had the Sammy for two weeks, nice unit, but returned it after getting an email and reading the CNET review in the nick of time, in which the LG390 edged it out for the top spot. I returned the Sams3600 for the LG since I was within the 30 day return period.. Bought from American Electronics for $340, not bad. The Sams was $350.. Thanks in advance, Like I said, just a guy that doesn't know alot, so I read CNET and some other reveiws and trust the "geeks" know what's up, and I say that with the utmost Respect..

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and makes all my DVD's look like HD movies. 
Cons:. Loved to stream movies from netflix...but after the first download update my wireless crashed and no matter what we do we can't get the player to reconnect. Very frustrating. It is not the router as we have many wireless devices with no problems.. 
Summary:. the process of re-connecting the player to our router is too cumbersome. Its like high level math, way over my head and I am pretty much computer savvy. Should be an easier way to plug and play. Or to at least have a trouble shooting screen to tell you EXACTLY what the problem is. So right now we are looking for a NEW player that will stream and play great DVD's, then we can take this one back.. 

$$;
Pros:. Netflix &#38; Vudu streaming. Easy set up - including wireless. Excellent picture &#38; sound quality. Quick load time. 
Cons:. Weak wifi signal, even using wireless N. No Pandora. Sometimes need two remotes instead of just 1 universal to navigate online features. 
Summary:. Bottom-line: i really like this player, but the wireless could be better.. This is my first BluRay player and I waited until prices came down and functions went up. My initial requirement was Netflix streaming, followed by a solid bluray player. After reading the positive reviews i decided to purchase the bd390 as compared to the Samsung 3600. I got the second to last bd390 in the store while there were pyramids of 3600s on the floor since they weren't selling. This is one of the more expensive BD players out there and thought it would be money well spent for the wireless N to stream HD movies to my HDTV. I have a new Airport Extreme wireless N router. From my experience, save the money you would spend on the wireless technology and put it towards the picture/sound quality as well as network features/offerings. Wireless N technology is supposed to have a farther wireless range and faster speeds. Those tech advances don't come into play with this player. My MacBook has full signal strength while placed next to my BD390 which only shows 2/5 bars -- not good. Obviously this affects the streaming quality. Even with wireless N, HD movies will stream in less than HD quality from time to time. For the best CONSISTENT picture, hard wire your internet connection to your player.. I still gave the player 4/5 stars b/c, for the most part, the streaming issues are limited and the player itself does an amazing job playing BD movies. If Pandora becomes available thru a firmware update, I'll be even happier.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast load time, plays older DVDs, fast firmware download, only one battery required in the remote, better up-converting than the Samsung 3600.. 
Cons:. Blockbuster online and Pandora not available yet.. 
Summary:. The product does everything well that is advertised. I originally purchased the Samsung 3600 at Best Buy and returned it due to the fact that it didn't play some of my older DVDs. The up-converting had a noticeable improvement from the Samsung and the speed of loading the disk was also a noticeable difference. Ease of use was the same, installation the same. Both solid products, but the LG wins out for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. This product has it all for me. The features that stick out are the VuDu service (Via firmware upgrade), Netflix, CinimaNow and YouTube. This player has all the connections you need. I was also able to play media from almost anything over the network. 
Cons:. This player has Wireless N, but it only seems to connect in wireless G mode and drops the connection around 30-45 minutes into a movie which then forces me to use an ethernet cable. A USB in the back would be great to add to the 1gig internal memory.. 
Summary:. The bottom line here is, if you want an all-in-one media powerhouse, then this player will do you well. And with the new VuDu service you get an even better bang for the buck with their 1080p video rentals. Now if they could just fix the wireless issue then I would have given it a straight five star.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast loading of all Blus and DVDs. Image quality is great. Firmware upgrades seem routine and flawless. The wifi works very well for me, although I don't like the quality/look of streaming films and chose not to use it for that.. 
Cons:. The remote is finicky and needs to be aimed just right.. Also a couple of times the loading tray has pinched a disc and jams. It may be an adjustment tolerance issue where the door-closer spring pushes up too soon.. 
Summary:. It's a good machine. There are no real serious concerns in the six months I've owned it and my Blu Rays look fantastic.. Updated. on Sep 21, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Much more than a BD player. Watching home movies and pictures from my PC over wi-fi without getting out of my chair. Watching movie trailers on Vudu (for free). YouTube is cool too and works great though the picture is low quality.. 
Cons:. User manual tells you how but not why. Had to do some research to figure out which audio settings to use. My Wi-Fi is too slow to stream HD content. Can't read video files with camcorder codec so you need to convert home video.. 
Summary:. I went out looking for a BD player and never expected to get all the rest at this price. I have a full 7.1 theater set up with quality equiptement and wasn't expecting to see (or hear) much difference over standard DVD's but was interested in some of the additional features found on BD's. I was suprised at the difference, particularly with the sound. My AV Reciever was already doing a good job of upscaling the video to 1080i but most DVD's didn't take advantage of all the speakers. I played around with the audio settings a bit as you can select from PCM 2 and multi channel, DTS re-encode, and Direct Pass-through. I decided to use the pass through and let my reciever do the decoding when necessary but the players DAC's were equal to the task as well using the PCM multi channel. The manual, by the way, gives you no help here so unless you live this stuff be prepared to do some research.. I never really considered VOD but having the NetFlix and Vudu built in is cool. I am not sure I will ever pay $10 or even $4 to rent a VOD movie since my wi-fi isn't fast enough to stream HD content but watching trailers in SD works fine and it is fun to see what is coming soon to theaters from my sofa.. What really excited me was the ability to grab the remote and throw the most recent pictures and videos of the kids onto the TV when Grandma and Grandpa drop by without having to dig for cables, find the camera or load anything.. If I could change anything it would be to add codec's for video cameras so I didn't have to mess around with home movies before I was able to play them back through the media center. Maybe they will add it later in a firmware upgrade. Also, although the remote is simple and easy to use, the buttons don't match up to my harmony universal remote very well so I end up with a second remote in my hand. The remote signal is also weak so, whereas I can easily bounce the IR from my harmony off the TV to hit the AV equiptment at the back of the room I have to point the BD players remote directly at the machine. No biggy for most but a pain in the neck (literally) for my setup.. 

$$;
Pros:. intuitive user interface. easy setup. good video. good audio. does a good job of upgrading DVDs. Wireless setup was easy. fast loading. I injoy the YouTube feature. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. I first bought the BD 370 because it was cheaper and I could use the wireless feature but prefer the hardwired internet because it is faster but while the 370 was ok on Bluray it did not seam to do a great job in upgrading some DVDs. This is important to me because I have many DVDs, The next day I took it back to the store and exchanged it for the 390 which has better video quality on DVDs. Also the 390 seem to have more features. Using the interface to display and play audio and video from my computer is also a feture that I like.. 

$$;
Pros:. Now has Vudu. Easy to set up. Firmware easily updates over the internet. Used update to add VUDU. Wireless network a great feature since most people don't have a wired network connection behind their TV.. 
Cons:. No rear USB port. Media player interface could have more features. No Pandora as of yet. Remote design could be better. Remote needs to be pointed right at the player.. 
Summary:. Excellent piece of electronics.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup, connected to my wireless g network in minutes, 24 fps. 
Cons:. Like to see more choices for streaming video and music.. 
Summary:. Paired with a Denon 4310 so I don't use its upscaling feature. Wireless performs flawlessly even with my old wireless g.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good on screen menus that are easy to use.. Excellent DLNA client, it even plays MKV files.. Addition of wireless N is a big plus.. Extremely easy to connect player to my network attached hard drive.. Nero is adequate for streaming media.. 
Cons:. BluRay discs start from the beginning after unit os powered down. Don't know if this common for all BD players.. Would have preferred Amazon on Demand to CinemaNow.. 
Summary:. The LG BD390 is the centerpiece of my hom theater system. The streaming media features are great. CinemaNow is handy when there isn't anything on cable. I recommend it as a strong buy for non-gamers who don't want a PS3. Novices with little networking experience may have some issues configuring the player to work with your router, but the auto configuration tool will work for most users.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is great. Netflix integration is nice...streaming looks "Good" to "Fair". YouTube feature is as expected. WiFi is Awesome Feature.. 
Cons:. Slower access times (on BD) then I was expecting. No ability to add Netflix movies to queue (Why???). YouTube interface clunky; hard to search (w/ on-screen keyboard). Issues with Mac's a bit of a heartbreaker. USB drive support fickle.. 
Summary:. This is my first BD player, and I really do like it. Though, I wonder if I'm more enthralled with the Netflix integration than anything. I had an upscalling DVD player, and honestly, I can't tell the difference between the upscale and the BD. I was a bit dissapointed by access speeds, but it wasn't a deal breaker.. Netflix streaming is pretty good. I wonder how long until they can stream true HD? YouTube integration is honestly a cool feature, but at the end of the day, it's still YouTube uber-compressed content, blown up on your big screen. I know more HD content is coming to YouTube, but till then, it's just "sub-par" to "OK". YT interface is awful...who want's to type in searches with a remote (does offer smart-searching though).. Connected to my Airport Extreme draft-n with no issues...the router is fast and so is this unit.. But...there are some issues with integrating your Mac computers with this unit. There is no native Upnp on Mac, so you have to find something compatible. I used Vuze, and while the unit is able to see the Vuze player, Vuze does not know how to stream to the BD390. Hopefully Vuze will add this a supported device. Tried EyeConnect and it worked. The unit does not support iTunes (obviously), nor does it support .MKV files (but I was able to stream .mpg files).. USB drive support seems to be shaky at best. I hooked up my Western Digital My Passport Firewire/USB drive to the BD390...and it would not recognize. This is probably my biggest frustration with the unit (Thanks for making me have to explain to my wife why the external drive I thought would work does not, and now I have to go by a completely new one...she'll "LOVE" that expenditure).. Overall, I am happy with the player....Dark Knight looked fantastic...and even with the issues with the Mac and USB drive, I probably would have still purchased this. I wanted Netflix streaming. I don't use Pandora so I didn't care about that service with the Samsung. I know I could have waited a few days to by the PS3 Slim which would have been a few bucks cheaper, offers streaming, and obviously Blu-Ray and gaming...but I have my heart set on an Xbox 360 (for gaming)...wife wanted a Blu-Ray player...I wanted gaming, and Netflix...and since the 360 Elites aren't coming down in price just yet...well..I wait...but happy with our purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. attractive design; awesome picture, fast loading, nice menu, need not go to menu to switch subtitles on/off. remembers where you stopped movie, pause holds for a very long time w/o shutting off, very utilitarian and functional remote.. 
Cons:. 10101010101010. 
Summary:. 10101010101010. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, fast load time on BD discs, easy wireless setup. 
Cons:. Some of the audio output options were not clear in the manual. 
Summary:. I like this player for its BD picture quality and ease of Netflix streaming (I have an Airport Express and had no problem finding it, contrary to others' claims that it does not work with Airport). I spent too much time trying to figure out how to get the pure bitstream audio for Dolby THD and DTS HD MA to output to my Onkyo 860. Once I selected (by trial and error) the correct output type, the receiver decoded the HD audio signals just fine, but it was a frustrating 45 minutes or so.. Overall, this is a very good player. I wish also that it had legacy video outputs (like composite and S-video) just in case I might need them someday.. 

$$;
Pros:. sharp user interface, easy to connect, speed, quality in picture and sound. 
Cons:. Manual a little confusing. 

$$;
Pros:. Netflix is one of the main reasons I bought it along with being wifi. The wifi is very good with the DSL elite I have with AT&#38;T. Great picture and sound.. 
Cons:. 1.The setup of the audio to my receiver. I'm not real sure what the manual is saying here. I'm in the middle of doing a "trial and error" with different setups for the audio.. 2. Cinema just doesn't work even after to talking with them.. 
Summary:. The picture is great using a blu ray disc. But I was pleasantly surprised of the quality of the picture using a HD watch instantly movie from Netflix. And it was delivered using the built in wireless adapter. (I get 5.0 Mb/s download from the internet) I can play my MKV video files from my portable hard drive using the USB port located on the front of the player. It does not play the MKV files directly form you computer using the ?My Media? icon on the home screen.. The setup was straight forward with the exception of the audio setup. I did not know what to enter on a few of these steps so I?m doing a little trial and error. If anyone knows the audio input for the BD390 when it is connected to an Onkyo TX-SR504 via the coaxial digital connection, please let me know. Right now I have both HDMI and SPDIF set on Primary Pass-Thru.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture/audio quality, execution speed, user interface.. 
Cons:. Manual not always clear, remote hard to open to access secondary interface.. 
Summary:. I'm returning it not because Netflix is not streaming multichannel sound. What you get is stereo (2-channel) sound only. I discovered this after 2 calls to Netflix and 1 call to LG support. The unit looks fine, though.. 

$$;
Pros:. Net streaming is the king of future BluRay players! Combo between all known formats for playback with a simple interface will prove the winner for my future purchases. 
Cons:. It's expensive! Oh wells.. 
Summary:. Just a question, the Wifi built in, the video review says it's Wifi-N, but is it 5Ghz or 2.4Ghz? I think an option for either way would be ideal, but knowing how tech development works, i would guess 2.4Ghz.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, quality of audio and picture, streaming of Netflix and YouTube.. 
Cons:. Doesn't stream Pandora. I'm hoping this can be added via firmware update. This is the only thing keeping the BD390 from getting 5 stars.. 
Summary:. I tried to save money by buying the Sharp BD-HP16U to match it to my Aquos TV. What a piece of junk. Once I returned it, I decided to do my homework. I looked at Sony, Samsung &#38; LG. I finally selected the LG BD390. Once I hooked it up and played my first Blu-Ray (The Police Certifiable concert) I haven't looked back. What's not to love. This unit is fast and plays a gorgeous picture. the big thing for me was the built in WiFi capability, including Draft-N. Unlike the Samsung, there is no dongle necessary. I am streaming Netflix, YouTube, and viewing movies, photos, and listening to music all from shares on my network. Be careful. This unit will turn you into a bonafide couch potato. I purchase a lot of gadgets and I can say honestly that this is one of most satisfying purchases. I would recommend it wholeheartedly. The $400 price tag is tough to swallow at first, but it was worth it once I started using it. For those of you wondering, I am not affiliated with LG in any way. I just like the unit that much and decided to share my opinion with the masses. Espicially since CNET has not reviewed it yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wonderful picture, both Blu-Ray and DVDs.. It's black (okay, maybe a hint of blue in the too-glossy faceplate, but it really appears black except in many photos).. 
Cons:. Foget the Internet connectivity features; they are extremely unreliable.. 
Summary:. Forget Netflix. YouTube is iffy. Wireless N connection is flaky. Tried everything to fix the problems--new firmware, turn off SecureSpot, static IP. On N network it refused to play Netflix 90% of time. On G network it has poor picture. VuDu is stunning. Go figure. LG denies that it's their problem, and the router manufacturers say that there's nothing they can do. And you, the customer, are stuck in the middle.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture. No compatibility problems yet. Good Connectivity. Analog Audio Outputs. 
Cons:. Price. Button Locations (Tray Open should be over the tray). Configuration of outputs. 
Summary:. No complaints about this unit except for the Cons listed above. I keep mixing up the power and tray buttons, which are opposite of where they would otherwise be. Probably more expensive than it needs to be, but it was the only player that had everything I wanted. Netflix is good (haven't used Cinema Now due to price--waiting for HD), and I have no connectivity issues (I use a wired connection). The analog audio outputs are great at avoiding getting a new HDMI receiver, when you can figure out how to configure them. Not the best, but it certainly serves its purpose well and has a good mix of features.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is great.. Wired or Wireless access to watch Netflix movies is great.. 
Cons:. NOT 5 GHZ capable.. 
Summary:. I was disappointed, and feel a little misled,given the wireless technology used in the device is 802.11n. My intent was to stream movies using my router's 5 Ghz Band and have my laptops etc connect via the 2.4 ghz band. However, the BD390 player only works with the 2.4 Ghz. That band gets a little crowded in my house with the number of devices attached to it. This hurts the wireless video quality and defeats the reason why I bought it, for it wireless capability. Now I have to wire it up. Damn!. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in Wi-Fi for Netflix, YouTube, good menus, sound format decoding. 
Cons:. Soft picture, color and depth not as strong as others, average sound quality, first unit was defective, cheap remote, Wi-Fi didn't recognize my VPN enabled router.. 
Summary:. I bought this player after reading the stellar review here. I am sad to report that image and sound quality were not even on par with the significantly older Panasonic DMP-BD35. The picture seemed soft or perhaps the color was less saturated. The audio started making a crackling noise and I had to exchange the unit. The new unit had sound quality that was also worse than the Panny. I ended up getting an Oppo BDP-83 instead. It has superior picture and color, gold-standard Anchor Bay VRS up-conversion for standard def DVDs, and killer sound. It also plays SACD and DVD-Audio. It does cost $500 and I give up wireless streaming - but I can buy a Roku box for $100 and get the best of both worlds. If you care more about quality and less about features, get the Oppo. If you are looking for a cheaper option, as I was for a gift for my dad, grab the Panasonic BDP-BD60, which lacks some marginally useful features but delivers where it counts - video and audio quality!. 

$$;
Pros:. When it connects, it works great.. I love the streaming content.. Works pretty well with my v1 HDTV (i.e., component connections to 1080i). Fairly good DVD player.. 
Cons:. When the connection fails its abysmal. And it drops of its own accord.. I get a little bit of left/right overscan in 1080i.. The WPS function seems to work but doesn't take.. It has 1GB of memory, why can't it buffer ahead when streaming content?. 
Summary:. So, right now, I am really frustrated. I purposely use a wired connection. Last night I was watching a Netflix movie, missed something and tried to rewind. No connection. I JUST HAD IT A SECOND AGO! The network drops for no apparent reason and comes back when it feels like it. And both the wired and wireless become non-functional. I tried the WPS process to get a wireless connection. No dice. When it was complete, I could see it from the router management-view...and then gone. I came across a similar reference that suggested putting the device in the router's DMZ...really, that's the best option?There is nothing on the LG website to remotely be of assistance (I think there are four knowledge base articles related to all of their video products). The live chat didn't function.. The quasi-keyboard navigation is another pet-peeve. The advanced form of "hunt and click" required for YouTube searches or (gawd forbid) trying to set up a 64-character WPA key) for the wireless connection is cumbersome. It would be nice to be able to connect a USB keyboard.. So with all of this, I really don't hate the product--if I did, it would be a lot easier to return it. When it has a mind to, it is a pretty incredible device. I used "The Fall" to test the Blu-Ray out, and other than some overscan (mostly noticeable during the credits), I was really happy. It's been hit and miss as it relates to the DVD display, with one title forced to 480p no matter what I tried and the other upscaling fine to 1080i.. So yeah, I am frustrated. I get a glimpse of nerd-nirvana, and then it gets yanked away. And what I am left with (for the moment) is a pretty expensive DVD player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Integrated streaming Netflix. Integrated WiFi for access to PC based media. Adequate remote control layout and clean, simple, sharp user interface. 
Cons:. HDMI does not work with Vizio GV47L LCD flat panel TV, rainbow static only. Slow responsiveness, I can't believe this is considered fast by Blu-Ray standards. Connected to wireless network with ease but won't access PC media (Vista issue). 
Summary:. This is my first Blu-Ray player and I have to say that I'm VERY underwhelmed by it and will be returning it as soon as BestBuy opens up today.. I love integrated WiFi for NetFlix and PC media access but the HDMI output does not work with my Vizio GV47L LCD flat panel TV so I'm stuck with using the component outputs which can't do 1080p. Hours with first &#38; second level tech support at both manufacturers was futile with both claiming ignorance and disinterest in developing a solution. LG obviously released this product without ensuring full compatibility to existing televisions (firmware update to the LG did not help). This Vizio TV is 1080p and less than 2 years old. From an engineering and testing standpoint, there's no excuse for this and LG's dismissive customer/tech support failed to invoke any brand confidence in me.. Not sure yet but I'm either going PS3, Samsung BD-P3600 or just wait for Blu-Ray players to mature for another year or so. The key functionality I want is Blu-Ray playback (in 1080p), streaming NetFlix, and network access to PC media. Gaming is a low priority.. With respect to the playback and uses I did experience with the BD390, the unit seemed to work quite fluidly and flawlessly. Upon isolating the HDMI compatibility issue with absolute certainty, I ran the device for a few days on 720p and 1080i through the component cables. All video and audio performance was great as far as a Joe average consumer like me can discern. Resolution, color, fluidity as well as basic 5.1 audio attributes were great while watching Quantum of Solace which stoutly challenges all such measures.. All connections and menu settings are quite simple with system navigation tasks feeling intuitive from first use. Unfortunately I didn't quite develop the same fluency with the playback functionality (resume, skip, markers, slow, fast-forward, etc.) which had me feeling very clumsy.. I connected the BD390 to my security enabled wireless network (n router on a 15MBS Comcast cable line) seamlessly on the first try and got a NetFlix trial account started in a flash. NetFlix worked great even though resolution is very poor on the 47? LCD panel. The value of experience equation for streaming NetFlix is certainly the algebra between convenience and picture quality with the latter suffering greatly. I still like it very much though. Connection to my wireless network was a breeze but I never bothered to sort out the Vista side issues that made my PC media access attempts from the BD390 result in ?PC Media Sharing not Authorized? slaps in the face.. So overall I'm neutral to dissatisfied with the LG BD390 and also now less enthusiastic about Blu-Ray in general. I?m somewhat annoyed with the value tradeoffs of the experience and will likely hover for months hoping for product developments before advancing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plenty of applications, Netflix, WIFI and DLNA supported, good HD image quality. 
Cons:. the DVD itself need improvement, it feels loose and not solid at hand. Also, DLNA need to improve, when I switch to anothe server, it still plays the music from the previous server. Weird.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu Ray looks great. no problems with memory or with sync of audio.. 
Cons:. Falsely advertises Netflix streaming and wifi connectivity.. 
Summary:. This was our first Blu Ray player. It plays movies great and we have no complaints with the performance of the machine in its primary function, which is to play DVD and BluRay movies. However, we are increasingly frustrated and disappointed in the player's WiFi connectivity. Most of the time the player doesnt recognize the network. no amount of fiddling with the settings improves this situation. When it does recognize the network, the video doesn't stream for more than a minute or two (after taking ten minutes to load) before shutting down or dropping the connection altogether. We have the same problem with youtube, and we havent even tried to use the other features after all the time we have wasted on getting the wireless to work. we have replaced the router (not the problem). we do not have the option of hardwiring to the network, no ethernet connection in our media space. I am very disappointed in this, and even with tons of researching have not found a solution. If anyone has a remedy, i would love to hear it. Unfortunately we are past our return period, so exchanging is not an option. Overall, a great bluray player but not worth the extra we paid to get the wireless features, that DONT WORK.. 

$$;
Pros:. Loved the Wi-Fi capability. Purchased specifically for Wi-Fi feature. Used Netflix regularly during first three months.. 
Cons:. Wi-Fi failed at 3 month mark. Unit cannot locate signal from wireless router approximate 13 feet away with zero signal interference. Multiple attempts to revive via LG Tech Support were huge waste of time.. 
Summary:. LG customer support has little to no technical knowledge. Apparently reading potential solutions directly from script. Have hard wired to ensure firmware is properly downloaded and current without success in reviving unit. Disappointed and will not purchase LG products in the future. Bad product supported by equally bad customer service.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has netflix and youtube.. 
Cons:. It doesn't read the disc sometimes .It has been only 9 months and i am experiencing the problem for the last 2 month.. I tried cleaning it with disc cleaner but it shows "NO DISC ".Sometimes it shows "ERROR".. The labour charge is high .. 
Summary:. It doesn't read the disc sometimes .It has been only 9 months and i am experiencing the problem for the last 2 month.. I tried cleaning it with disc cleaner but it shows "NO DISC ".Sometimes it shows "ERROR".. The labour charge is high .I alraedy paid more than 400 for it and now again after 9 months i have to pay $70 .This. really hurts.What is the benefit to buy such a costly product which cannot even work for 2 to 3 yrs properly.. 

$$;
Pros:. The load time was fast, the wifi was a breeze to set up. The picture quality was impressive. We really got into streaming the Netflix queue and browsing YouTube. DVDs worked fine. Firmware upgrades were easy.. 
Cons:. The Blu-ray discs froze or skipped. It was not the discs. I tried duplicates. Then, they stopped working altogether. After about 30 days of use, the disc player broke. No disc, blu ray or DVD would register in the machine. Returned for refund.. 
Summary:. There is no other product that appears to compare in functionality of this device. It set up and worked so well initially but I got nervous when Blu rays were not being read smoothly by the machine. It's no fun having a movie quit 7 minutes in. Then, suddenly, NO disc would work. It would show on screen the rotating disc upon insert and then read "No disc". Neither type worked. I had to return it. This apparently is happening to some of these units according to a web search. Thankfully, Best Buy had an extended return for xmas gifts. They did not have another in stock in a 50 mile radius. They had no comparable model with wifi. I don't know what to do to replace it. Color me really disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it does work, (and that seems to be when it wants to) it works great.. 
Cons:. Can not find my WiFi connection that is 15 ft. away 50% of the time. Get a "No Signal" about 25% of the time. 
Summary:. The unit does not work as advertised. The LG service is terrible. I know this is to rate the unit, but the service seems to find everything else in my home at fault except their unit.. I do not recommend purchase of this unit until this gets addressed properly. When it does, this unit will get all five stars. Again, works great when it works.. 

$$;
Pros:. great picture,fast loading,nice online apps easy to use. 
Cons:. wont play current crop of movies that have come out since may of this year.... 
Summary:. Purchased this player in June of 2009, worked great for about 10 months,firmware upgrades almost every other month. Around April of 2010, I started to have problems with blu-ray playback. There was 1update in April of 2010 and the last one. After putting disc in , it would spin about 10 times and eject disc with the message to check disc. For the next 4 months, this player would only play about 15% of the newer disc that came out between April and September of this year. After back and forth with customer service, I was told it had to be repaired and I would be charged $70 dollars to repair and there was no more firmware or software upgrades. LG really has no answer on how to fix this player.I will never buy another LG product.. 

$$;
Pros:. User interface. 
Cons:. - First unit I purchased would not recognize blu-ray disk (check disc error) but would play DVD. - Customer service said to load updated software which I did and it had no effect at all. - Purchased a second unit and it wouldn't even power up. 
Summary:. Neither unit I purchased worked. The first(mfrd 10/2009) would not recognize blue-ray and the second (mfrd 9/2009) wouldn't even power-up. LG customer support was worthless. Tried every software update on their web-site for the first unit and did not fix. I ended up buying a Sony BDP-S560 and it worked right out of the box. I would have liked the LG because of features, etc. but I cannot believe the lack of quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. Netflix - streamed well. 
Cons:. Interface - horrific...have they seen iTunes or appleTV?. 
Summary:. Netflix worked great for the one night I set it up. I configured it to my wireless router (I'm no computer geek, but did it pretty quickly) and was able to watch movies seemlessly. This honestly a great feature, but the cons were just too big. Music/Photo interface was something out of the late 80's. It took gargantuan efforts in order to have the system "sync" with my computer in the first place. Then to play a single song, I had to plow through multiple folders and sub-folders just to access the music file - and when finally there, the file wouldn't play. The functionality was so poor, advertising that it was this function is just misleading. Would NEVER use it since it's so complicated.. There are plenty of things out there that are designed more intelligently and have an interface that is sensible for the things it professes to integrate.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality and audio was great. Loved the built in wireless and Netflix streaming.. 
Cons:. Stopped playing standard DVD's after 7 months. LG will only fix it if you pay $69.. 
Summary:. I actually really loved the product while it worked. Playback quality on both video and audio was great. Both Blu Ray discs and standard DVD's. Problem is that about 3 months ago it stopped playing regular DVD's. I purchased this product November 2009 so it didn't last even a year. If you just do a search query on the internet you will find that this is a widespread problem. For some people it won't play regular DVD's, others Blu Ray discs, for some their media files they have on their computers. Also you will see that LG customer support is just terrible. First thing I did was go online to see if others had posted a solution. That's when I read how terrible LG support was. Well, I called them up myself and I can attest that it was. After a 15 minute conversation in which he denied there was a problem he gave me instructions on how to do a hard reset. I forget exactly what it was, something like holding the power button and pause button simultaneously for 40 seconds. Anyway, after the hard reset it still wouldn't play normal DVD's. This was my first LG product and I will not be buying another one. It's really too bad because I did a lot of research on the internet and the LG Blu Ray players had exactly the feature sets I was looking for - excellent playback, built in wireless, and Netflix streaming. Apparently Sony and Samsung players don't do a good, reliable job of streaming and Panasonic lags behind in built in wireless and interface. The LG bd 390 did everything really well but their last firmware update messed up the player. Now I'm looking for another Blu Ray player and it's annoying that the LG BD 570 and 590 again seems to have everything I'm looking for but I will NOT be spending my money on a LG Blu Ray player again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wireless is great, but spotty. Lots of internet based services.. 
Cons:. Wifi cuts out. UI is awful. Price is too high. 
Summary:. Awful remote function and play back freezes or skips. Had mine for 9 months. Use Netflix BD service and had 1 out of every 3 disks fail on the LG. The same disk that fails on the LG works fine on our Samsung.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray capabilities, boot time, streaming Netflix, built in wireless networking, and media center capabilities are all great.. 
Cons:. The unit doesn't work...it periodically freezes and shuts down.. 
Summary:. Out of the box, within a number of minutes, the unit would freeze and then shut itself down. This problem would happen periodically while watching movies, either Blu-Ray, standard definition DVD, or streaming Netflix. I contacted support, and they had me send it in for service. The unit came back in about 1.5 weeks, and I set it up again. Within a minute of watching a standard definition movie, it froze and shut down. I restart the machine, and 11 minutes and 26 seconds in, the unit freezes and shuts down. I contact support the following morning and they have the gall to tell me that nothing is wrong with the unit. In my mind, if the unit freezes and shuts itself down while watching a movie, there is something wrong with the unit.. Then they tell me that if I were to directly connect the unit to my broadband modem, it would solve the problem. My question is this: why would LG build in a wireless connection if it has to be connected directly to the modem, and why would the internet connection have anything to do with the unit shutting down during DVD playback? According to LG support, this can happen if the internet connection isn't fast enough or doesn't have a good enough signal strength. I have a wireless-N access point that is plenty fast, and streams just fine to an X-box 360 which sits about 12 inches from the LG BD390.... Unfortunately after going through all of this, I can no longer return the unit to retailer since the window to return the unit has passed..

Pros:. Easy setup, Wireless network feature works well.. 
Cons:. Can't playback all blu-ray discs without purchasing a seperate, additional USB flashdrive.. 
Summary:. I am attaching all my email communication with LG. (Start From The Bottom). Dear Mr. ,. Thank you for contacting LG Electronics. Your e-mail regarding your concern has been received.. I sincerely apologize for the delay and inconveniences; unfortunately some movies have more data than others and it will require more space, the player already have 1 GB, make sure to clean the memory and try to use the USB..

Subject: Re: LG Customer Inquiry. Thank you,. I really feel I have been short changed, to have to buy additional hardware to get my player to work is not really acceptable. You are basically selling the public an incomplete item. Why doesn't LG provide sufficient internal memory for this player? Why make the customer pay additional money out of pocket to run the most basic feature?. I have a few days before my 30 day return policy expires, I will test your fix. If it doesn't work, I will return the player. I may return it even if it does work.. I am disapointed because this player got a good review on Cnet.com. I will be forwarding this whole email string to them so they will be aware.. From: Daniel &lt;customerservice@lge.com&gt;. To:. Sent: Tue, October 20, 2009 6:58:33 AM. Subject: Re: LG Customer Inquiry. Dear ,. Thank you for contacting LG Electronics. We are always glad to assist you.. Regretfully, although you may not be using the BD Live features within the disc, this and other couple of movies will automatically download BD Live content or try to save information to the receiver in order to achieve successful playback, which is the reason why an external USB memory key is needed to play such movies..

LGEAI. -----------Original Customer Inquiry------------. Received Date : 10/17/2009 21:33:37. The type of inquiry : Product Operation. Product/Model No. : DVD&#38;VIDEO&#38;SET TOP/BD390. Just played my first blu-ray disc "watchmen." Started great for the fist. 30 to 45 minutes, then I had a problem with the audio and video sync-ing up. It seemed that when the disc changed ?layers? the audio would lag by a good half second or more. This happened 3 or 4 times during the movie when the ?layer? changed. (I could tell the layer was changing due to a slight skip in the picture, similar to DVD?s I have viewed in the past.) The strange part is when I paused the movie and rewound a few seconds, the audio and video would sync back up. Do I have a defective player?. Updated. on Oct 22, 2009.

$$;
Pros:. Nothing! Piece of garbage. Poor reliability. Poor remote. AVOID. 
Cons:. Virtually new unit will not play blue ray discs. LG won't do anything to correct.. 
Summary:. Bought this expensive unit because of good cnet review. I have a good DVD player, so this unit only played less than 10 new Blue Ray discs. The unit will no longer play Blue Rays or DVDs, tries to read and then says "no disk". Internet search yields numerous other similar complaints and otgher premature failures.. LG tech support/warranty worthless. Parts and labor only 90 days, Parts 1 year. My parts would be covered but I feel investing more money in shipping and labor for a bad product will likely be a bad investment.. I expect better reliability for a supposed higher end player.. AVOID LG Blue Ray players!. 

$$;
Pros:. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Since mine broke, hard to see a pro. Perhaps it is a nice paper weight. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.. 
Cons:. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Hardware unreliable; prone to burning out with minor use. Customer service had long delays &#38; no ability to fix the problem. The only solution they offered was $100; unacceptable for nearly new product. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. 
Summary:. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT..

Pros:. None. Needs Improvement!. 
Cons:. Bad Customer Service!!!. 
Summary:. I recently purchased a LG BD390 Blu-ray Player not more then a month ago. I purchased it for all of the great added multimedia options the unit has. Little did I know LG produced a faulty machine!. When I first got the unit I immediately activated the NetFlix service which I love. Unfortunately every couple of days, I would have to reactivate it because it would loose it's activation. Not knowing this was a sign of a much bigger problem.. I tried activating the VUDU service about two weeks ago and that's where the problem begins. When I went to use it for the first time, I received an error that the hardware ID was in use. I thought maybe the unit I received was a repacked return. I found out today that it wasn't. Here is where it gets interesting. I contacted VUDU support immediately. They told me LG is KNOWN TO ISSUE DUPLICATE MAC ADDRESSES on there units. I had to provide them with the Serial#, LAN MAC, and Wireless MAC. I was provided this long procedure to get all of that info, because LG doesn't put the MAC addresses on there boxes or equipment. And to make matters worse, they couldn't even do anything with me until they contacted the customer with the same MAC address as me to have that customer verify all of the same information using the same long procedure. To me, if I'm already a customer and you asked me to verify all of that info, I would tell you to jump in a lake. VUDU verified I was issued a duplicate MAC address.. THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DESIGN DEFECT!!!. After 2 weeks of phone calls and emails going back and forth, VUDU contacted LG, who in turn contacted me today. Here is what LG is offering to do for me. The unit needs to be repaired/replaced. Keep in mind my unit is not even a month old.. 1. LG is willing to pay for 2nd Day Air Shipping to there factory and 2nd Day Air Shipping back. I asked for Overnight Shipping since it's there design defect, I was clearly told No. The Manager told me, "I just have to deal with it." When I got my label to ship it back, it was for FedEx Ground Shipping. *** is that?. 2. When I asked the turn around time. I was told 10 business days. Mostly due to shipping. 10 business days because of there design defect? That's why I asked for overnight shipping. Why should I do without because of there manufacturing design defect!. 3. When the unit is received they will swap it out for a refurbished unit! I purchased my unit BRAND NEW NOT REFURBISHED!!! So, not only do I get slapped in the face with the shipping, I get a refurbed unit? I spoke to another Manager in customer service tonight, he tells me they repair your unit. I tell him you think I'm a fool. The Shipping Label I got clearly says "RefurbSwap". When I told him that he had no response. He said there was nothing he could do.. I've own/owned multiple LG products, LCD TVs, Cell Phones, etc through out the years. This experience has put a sour taste in my mouth and I will NEVER purchase another LG product ever again!. I have not sent the unit back yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. NOTHING AT ALL. 
Cons:. TO MUCH TO EXPLAIN. 
Summary:. It would not connect to my wireless network so after spending 5 hours talking to LG on the phone they told me to go and try a other one so I went to BEST BUY and the guy said it was a bad model and had a lot of problems. And told me to get the SAMSUNG BD-P3600 And it works wounderfully.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good bluray movie quality. 
Cons:. its a bad value considering that this bluray player costs 300 bucks, cough cough the PS3 is now only 300 bucks.. 
Summary:. the PS3 is a game console and a blu ray player and it also costs 300 bucks. This player is 300 bucks and it does not play games. So if u want a blu ray player then get the PS3 not this.. 

$$;
Pros:. On paper, should be a great player. 
Cons:. Lipsynch issues on all media. Mediocre deinterlacing - cannot resolve 2:2 and numerous film cadences without heavy moire. 
Summary:. Quality control must be terrible at LG. I tried two players at BestBuy that both had terrible lipsynch issues on all media. If you want truly videophile quality, get a pioneer 320 and a roku for netflix for the same price..
