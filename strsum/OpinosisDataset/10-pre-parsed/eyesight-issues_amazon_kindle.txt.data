i have not experienced eye, strain .

0 out of 5 stars a great tool for those of us with aging eyes, february 28, 2009

this means you can read for longer periods of time without eyestrain .

e, ink hardly strains your eyes .

'easy, on, the, eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink :

for me, it was no problem at all, no eye strain after reading for a few hours .

truly, this helps in my eyes .

using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .

,  eye strain is completely non, existant in my experience .

although i'm turning pages quicker, my eyes are much less tired by using a bigger font .
