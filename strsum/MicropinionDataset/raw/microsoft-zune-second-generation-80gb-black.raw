$$;
Pros:. Sleek Design. Great software. Unmached User Interface. Terrific build quality. 
Cons:. I have nothing negative to add about the Zune. 
Summary:. I absolutetly LOVE my 80GB Zune. I bought the first zune when it first came out and loved it. When this one came out, I just had to buy it, so I saved up some money and bought it too. Although its not as tough as the Zune 30 it is still amazingly resiliant compared to the fragility of Apple's iPod devices. I have watched the Zune grow from a decent underdog, to the amazing iPod competitor it is today, and have nothing but respect for the zune team. This is a great device with great features, and I cannot wait for the Zune HD to hit the market (Just in time for my birthday I might add). My only problem is that the touchpad does not have directional buttons, just a single click, and determines the wanted action based on the location of the finger on the pad, meaning, as with all single touch devices, if you touch it in one spot, and then select in in another, it will only react to the location of the first touch.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easily the best thing about the Zune 80 is the usability, and the free automatic updates due to the firmware.. 
Cons:. 80gbs are nice, but can easily be overcomed. 
Summary:. if you are like me and like to have all of your music organized and look the way you want it to, and to be able to share your music with friends and then have their music as well this is the device for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. better than my ipod, easier to navigate through menus.. better user interface. the actual player itself is a lot more durable than my ipod (i'm a bit of a device dropper). the fm tuner is SO awesome... and wireless networking is fantastic.. 
Cons:. took a bit of time to get used to the interface when i switched from ipod/itunes.. i have yet to be able to find how to make on the go playlists (if this is enven possible on a zune). 
Summary:. i love my zune. with the features it has, it's hard for my old ipod to measure up. for sure, i can't download the fart app that i had on my 32gb ipod touch.. but as far as useful features go, this zune can beat down a pod any day.. 

$$;
Pros:. surpisingly light weight. sturdy. ample screen size. easy to use interface. easy to use wireless sync. the touch pad. not a touch screen (personal opinion: i dont like touch screens). ample hard drive. good battery life. 
Cons:. bulky (to me the ipod 4th gen was the perfect size). lack of accessories (liscneced anyways). 
Summary:. Ive owned now 4 ipods. All have bit the dust in some form or another, without any sort of rough use. Ipod 2nd gen, died at 373 days. Just outside of warranty. Ipod shuffle, original 1 gb, died 14 months after purchase. Ipod shuffle (2nd gen), died 9 months after purchase, didnt call on warranty. Ipod photo, lasted the longest at 1 year, 6 months. I use my ipod for two things, in the car and while running. Seems to me they are designed to not last that much longer than the warranty.. Ive had my 80gb zune for awhile now, and it is holding up fairly well. I charge every 3-4 days and have not had an issue yet with battery life. I like the touch pad and the ease of navigation through the menus. Like I said I dont like "fat finger" screens as neither phones nor mp3 players have gotten the touch screen right yet, unless your fingers are the size of a 5 year olds...... Video playback is phenominal, no lag or video quality issues. No format issues as Zune software automatically coverts the format while syncing with your Zune. (no more need for 3rd party programs to convert). The Zune marketplace does have tv and movies, and the points work both on Zune and the 360. (harmonix and redoctane are both in talks to include a mp3 of downloaded rockband and world tour songs to users at no additional costs).. As far as sharing music, its a nice feature but not one I truely need. It is nice if you really want a song or album, you can quick get it on your zune, and the next place you get wifi simply purchase the rights.. Im done with ipods (well my wife has a mini still, with a 3rd party battery cause the OEM died at 13 months, suprise suprise.) The bulky ugly memory hungry itunes is off my laptop and pc, and eventually will be off my wifes laptop. Althouigh I dont like buying songs or videos off of Zune, I do like the way it handles podcasts, in my opinion, its finally a good way to manage them. I get my mp3s from Amazon.com or ripped from cd.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Reliable. -Great Sound. -Great Interface. -NOT APPLE!. -Great Customer Support. 
Cons:. -A little larger than competing iPod. -Can break if dropped hard on concrete. 
Summary:. I have owned my Zune 80GB since it was released a little over a year ago. It is my 3rd MP3 player and by far my favorite. In fact, I recently dropped my Zune on the sidewalk and it broke. I do not fault the product. I have dropped it countless times before without failure. But a spinning hard drive isn't designed to put up with complete torture. Anyway, I love this player.. Now I know that it is trying hard to keep up with the iPod and many of my friends laugh that I am sticking with Zune. It doesn't have a touch screen. Its a bit bigger than the iPod with equal storage. And it doesn't offer you the chance to be just like everybody else.. So whats the big deal. No stupid iPod music format. Even though Apple has removed the DRM from many of its iTunes library, it still downloads in a format that only works with Apple software and players. So, once you go Apple, it is a royal pain in the ass to turn back. Now I do download most of my music from Amazon. But even when I do grab files from the Zune Marketplace, it downloads in a format that works great with ANY MP3 player.. The interface is smooth and easy. And the thing sounds great! Give it a try. I normally want different toys when I get the chance to buy them. But this one was worth the investment twice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice bog screen good for watching movies. Good audio quality and great podcast selection. Its a nice sturdy design that does not scratch easily. i really dont like touch screens so i love the zune pad. fast responsive and nice to use.. 
Cons:. I don't really have any complaints. little lag once in a while between songs but it rarely ever happens. Screen could be brighter. 
Summary:. Its just a great little device. it really is a device for music lovers. It has a really good screen a dream to watch movies on. it could have a better light but its really really good. love the podcast feature. and i like the new games section. i dont really know what else to say. its a MP3 player so it has all the music option like any other but i really like to make a quick playlist right on my zune. Also really like the zune software. it just seems classier. Im not sure of what else to say. But i really like this over the ipod. (yes i have had a ipod before). 

$$;
Pros:. zune pad. huge screen. twist interface. price for storage. fm radio (yes i still listen to that). wireless marketplace (although it could still use some tweaking). customizable wallpaper. podcast system. 
Cons:. menu can be sluggish at times. somewhat disappointing battery life compared to other players. limited video support but then again so do most players. 
Summary:. definitely the best mp3 player I have ever purchased. $230 for 80GB is a great deal. the design is enough to handle my day to day abuse and the sound quality is better than most. so much fun to use because of the zune pad and the twist interface. thrown in the wallpaper and you have got me hooked. the only thing I can dislike is the lack of video file type support. why doesnt anyone use avi files?. 

$$;
Pros:. nice look, different desighn,AMAZING video quality,.......(i'll save more for the full review.). 
Cons:. nothing at all.. 
Summary:. I love microsoft for this thing, its awesome. It has a nice display, and shows way better video than the ipod. i like the having to play the radio without paying extra money for it(u know where im getting at). this is probably the best portable media player i have owned, and havent given me any problems at all. you may not be able to surf the web, but hey, thats what COMPUTERS are for right? and its a pc-only device for a reason, i dont see why cnet think that is a bad thing. gotta luv it.5/5 stars!. 

$$;
Pros:. the reduction of its size, its new user interface(I could go on). 
Cons:. its battery life. 
Summary:. The wireless trick is simply astonishing as i hardly feel up to the task of plugging my Ipod to my pc. I still think Microsoft should make a mac version of the Zune software as this could or rather would increase (whether you agree or not) its market and hope fully ensure a take over s i would buy the Zune 10 times over .. 

$$;
Pros:. -Huge Screen. -Wireless Syncing. -Great Sound Quality. -FM Radio. -Shows Album Covers. -Zune Pass. -Gets Better Every Update. 
Cons:. -There is Still no Touch Zune. -Can't Rent Movies on the Zune Marketplace yet.. 
Summary:. The Zune 80 is way better then the iPod Classic/Nano and it keeps getting better with every update. If your looking for a Hard Drive/Flash Based MP3 Player. Go with the Zune. If You get it, i recommend getting the Zune Pass.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of options and really big text! Fast and touchpad is so cool. 
Cons:. Haven't found any yet. 
Summary:. I have had an mp3 player back when RIO actually still made them. I have sampled so many over the years and LOVE this one the best. Go ahead...join the SOCIAL! U will be glad u did!. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing Sound Quality, Amazing Features. Zune Pad. Wireless Sharing. Radio. Custom Backgrounds. Nice interface. etc.

Summary:. I cannot wait to get one of these next week.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wireless Sync, Podcasts. 
Cons:. None, Device is Great. 
Summary:. The Zune 80 is by far the best Portable Media Player(PMP) on the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the fact that it has wireless sync. podcasts. thiner and lighter, the new control pad is cool too.. 
Cons:. i would like to see a clock and no restrictions on WI FI but its still cool. 

$$;
Pros:. great evolution. 
Cons:. no internet and emails. 
Summary:. listen! you ought to buy this one.. 1st of all.. you can put tens of thousand of songs on its new 80gb hard drive.. whoa! the price is just amazingly affordable.. great changes.. overall, its just a one fantastic gadget.. a must have for the holidays.. i wont buy no itouch for 399 with only 16gb of music.. id rather use my sony psp and put a memory stick on it.. turn on my wifi.. photos video.. everything that itouch does is the same with my psp.. but im tellin you.. zune 80 is one helluva sh*t.. its so tight.. the resolusion is just...... .. wOw.. im so speechless i cant wait to put my hands on this sh*t.. =). 

$$;
Pros:. Better than Ipod Classic. 
Cons:. not as intuitive as itouch with internet. 
Summary:. Zune is a great product. 

$$;
Pros:. huge screen, wireless, microsoft, scratch resistence, interface, much more!. 
Cons:. No movies on markretplace...yet. 
Summary:. I love my old zune with a passion!I have owned a huge number of hard drive based devices in the past including the ipod the creative the anchros the toshiba and much more!The zune is my favorite and i am looking foward to this one also!. 

$$;
Pros:. Super Fast Gui, Zune pad is incredible sensitive, great glass screen, premuim headphones. 
Cons:. doesnt come in brown, need more people with Zunes to get the feeling of the social to share songs, pics, etc. 
Summary:. I had a hands on test of the Zune 80 and MS sure has a winner this time. The design is incredible compact, 80g HD, GLASS Screen, and with the new Firmware with the podcast, that even the old Zune will get. Also the Zune 80 comes with premuim headphones already that are better then the $40 I spent for the old Zune premuim headphone. The Zune pound for pound and better overall device, and with future updates the Zunes are going to be force to reckon with. Zune FTW. 

$$;
Pros:. New nav. button, Wireless sync, dvd quality out, real good quality music playback etc.. 
Cons:. Slightly bigger than the iPood, no further cons known.. 
Summary:. This is mostly to even the score (see all the 1's, and 4's given by people who actually want to rate the zune 30, don't want the zune 80 to have a god score, iFanboys and monkeys who don't want to write a decent review after looking at the specs and functions.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Customizable, WIFI Sharing (now w/o 3 day restriction), 21 Hour battery life, Big Screen, Very Thin, Good Looking, Made by Microsoft. 
Cons:. No Real Video Store (just Music Video), Still 3 play restriction on shared music, only one color.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful, unique double-shot color. 
Cons:. There are none,. 
Summary:. This Zune will be a hit. The first Zune was a great product (I own one) and I thought it was unique and different, in a good way. Great navigation, great screen, and theres even a radio! Now the Zune 80 will have all of the old Zunes features, with even more features of its own. Bigger screen, TV-out is DVD Quoality, grea navigation with the Zune Pad, and a great-looking product. I will definitely buy one, and reccomend to everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything you want is included in the perfect player.. 
Cons:. silver backing unlike zune 30. Needs on-the-fly delete option. Needs "recently added" playlist.. 
Summary:. I loved the Zune 30, and this one just blows me away. 

$$;
Pros:. Wifi, FM radio, thinner. 
Cons:. not free, only 1 color. 
Summary:. I've been wanting wireless sync for so long and the 1 click podcast subscription system.. 

$$;
Pros:. it's massive screen, much more customizable than the ipod, wi-fi, scratch resistant screen.. 
Cons:. i haven't noticed any flaws so far.... 
Summary:. Ok, first of all, between all the mp3 players i think this will be the winner, it has the best features, it's sleek and preety. It also has wireless synch, also it's screen is really big which is really useful espetially if you want to watch movies in it. It also has a scratch resistant glass screen so I dont have to worry all the time if it gets scratched or not. You can also share songs (although shared songs will have to be bought after being played 3 times).It supports more video formats than the ipod, that is really good since it gets really annoying to convert every video to mp4 and sometimes it takes a really long time. I think this player will be a great success.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice Design Wirelesss Sync FM Radio Zune Card. 
Cons:. No Wireless Store No Clock :(. 
Summary:. wow when then first zune came out i was impressed unlike most people but now that this new piece of equipment is coming out i think ill be music heaven. i never really liked the ipod. The ipod touch was pretty nice but 400.00 for only 16gigs? I think not. This has such a great interface and im so pumped to get it on launch day! it seems like alot more people are excited about this product than the first zune as well!. 

$$;
Pros:. is better then any ipod, looks cool, better then the original. 
Cons:. the wifi cant access the internet like the ipod touch and that isnt even that big of a dead. 
Summary:. i cant wait i already preordered it and i cant stop talking about it... i bet all my friends are sick of hearing about it but i cant help but talk about it. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, zune pad, and every thing else. 
Cons:. they could of done more with the wifi. 
Summary:. well now this should of been the first zune, though i love that one too, but the zune 80 is sure to make a name for it self now what alot of fan boy(apple) are doin is comparing it to the apple touch, well you really can't do that with a flash and a hdd the zune 80 is ment to compete with the ipod hdd's and it beats the ipod 80gig by a long shot. 

$$;
Pros:. huge screen, cool navigation, wireless sync, 30 hr battery audio, send songs, videos and pictures. 
Cons:. no internet or purchasing music. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen and has good tv-out with good sound quality(i heard that they got the sound quality from sony). 
Cons:. I dont know any cons right now because i dont have one. 
Summary:. I would want to buy one and it looks better than the ipod or any mp3 player out there. I think this will be the ipod killer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best of the Best. 
Cons:. Rien, Nothing,. 
Summary:. A person that wants a digital pers. player, should purchase the Zune.. I have nothing to add except buy it now!. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing Interface, Podcast Support, HD Video, FM Raidio, Wireless Sync, Share Songs, Great Sound Quality.. 
Cons:. Does not work with Mac, Does not have Wireless Media Downloading from Zune Media Center, Does not have a Clock.. 
Summary:. The Zune in my opinion is one of the best media players on the market. Its main the competitor has the Ipod Classic The Ipod Nano and the Ipod Touch. The iPod Line up either offers you Large Hard Drive Capacity with a good interface or Not much Storage with a beatiful iterface and wifi. The Zune is the best of both Worlds with a 80 GB Hard Drive, a intuitive interface and great hardware like wifi, and fm raido built in. I am a previous Zune 30 GB owner and I was very pleased with it before. Overall the Zune is a great product that is a better overall value than its competitor the ipod classic.. 

$$;
Pros:. apple killer, interface is magnificent interface and much more!!!. 
Cons:. i do not see a flaws as of yet. lets hope not.. 
Summary:. this is going to be the ipod killer!!! finally some competition!!!!!!!! i am not bashing the new creative at all. thats a nice unit, but the price does not balance. the 16gb zen is the price of this unit. so, i am going to go with this unit perhaps. also, it would show that apple is not the only company with the goods now!! i really hope this unit sells well along with the creative units. my gosh!!! look at it!!!! and black looks good by the way. also, the features are outstanding!! you cannot beat preumium headphones and the fm tuner!!! something apple does not have cause you have to pay extra for that. i cannot wait to see this in stores!!!!!!!!!!! ahh!!!!! im now pumped!!! i was in class today and my friend whos an ipod crazed consumer had the ipod classic, which i do not see a difference from the exterior- same old stupid wheel and the screen.......and, im like, i hope a unit blows away the ipod. the ipod may have all the super features, but can it deliver meaning, can it last? is an ipod really worth the hassle? no. i was also reading that, the new softwear can import your wmply playlist. that is great beause i am a wmplyr user and its super esy syncing your music. ahhhhhh!!!!!!!!!! this is a new improvement. the first generarion zune was bulky, but this unit looks fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i cannot wait to see this unit unveiled. people get the zune or creative- not ipod. ipod=trouble. do not be decieved by the apple. the apple is posinous.. 

$$;
Pros:. New Dezine great fetures huge screen. 
Cons:. none its awesome. 
Summary:. I have the origanal zune and the only problem i had with that was that it was really thick and that new zune is very thin and its got great new features. i got to test it out because i have some inside freinds. also expect a new zune to come out soon thats kind of like that shuffle, but smaller with an radio. 

$$;
Pros:. Best portable media player I've seen.(Archos may come close but it's a brick, Ipod lol). All the music you can download and 10 free tracks every month for the price of a CD with Zunepass.Wireless sync, browsing and downloading in any hot-spot.FM tuner. 
Cons:. Its not as easy to find accessories for as ipods. But I see more all the time. I had a software glitch that took a little time to fix after my Zunepass lapsed for a few wks. I cracked my screen somehow, but it's not noticeable when watching something. 
Summary:. The Zune is incredible. For the price of a CD every month you get all of the music and podcasts you want and you are also able to buy 10 songs for free with the Zunepass. I don't know why anyone wouldn't take advantage of it. Even if your against "renting" your music, you might as well seeing as though you can keep any 10 tracks every month and buy any others you want, consider the other 20,000 songs you may have to give back if you don't keep your subscription a bonus. Wireless sync, browsing and downloading in any hot-spot. FM tuner. Very easy and logical User Interface. Huge screen w/excellent resolution. You can pick the conversion settings and not lose audio quality. I have a dock that wires into my TV that has a remote so I can watch podcasts in HD on a huge screen. It will optimize downloads for TV if you choose. It's also like having a built in TV/DVD in my car, I found a nice little cell phone/MP3 holder that easily turns side ways for videos. I've had it over a year, it's by far my most favorite toy. I have a music collection it would take a year to hear plus about 50 podcasts updating every time I watch or listen to one. My only real gripe is the software makes my computer lag a bit. I only have about half a GB of RAM right now, so almost anything will.. This is a winner.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use navigation, FM radio, sharing with other zune users, zune pass, zune software is VERY easy to use, and big screen which makes movie watching great.. 
Cons:. Battery life, no downloadable movies, not very many zune users to share with, small selection of accesories, pretty bulky, and not very many games.. 
Summary:. I used to have an Ipod but I switched over to the zune when my ipod became outdated (just after a year) and I am happy with my choice. I have had my zune for a year and I havnt found the need to get a new verison because zune automaticaly updates for you. Because of the zunes navigation, earphones, zune pass ,and the easy to use zune software make listening to music is much better on the zune than the ipod. But if you are looking for videos the ipod is the one to get because of its battery life and its movie and TV show selection. But if you want movies on your zune and dont want to pay for them there are some softwares you can get to easily put movies on it. Zune doesnt have very many accesories but it has all the ones you may need. I am extremely happy with my zune and I would never trade it for any ipod, and I think any other zune user would agree with me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, touch pad, user interface, Wifi, overall quality.. 
Cons:. No major flaws.. 
Summary:. I've had my Zune for almost a year now, and its probably one of my favorite electronics. It is really easy to use, holds a lot of songs and videos, and is fairly light to carry. I use it at work, when I ride my bike/rollerblade, and when I ride my motorcylce. It is very convenient. The only complaint I really have is that there is little third party support for accessories, and Microsoft's are overpriced. I have the Adapter to listen to it over the radio in my car, it works but it is not perfect. There can be a lot of static and it is hard to find a open station. I am not a huge fan or iPODs, i think they are overrated. The Zune is a good alternative.. 

$$;
Pros:. extremely good sound quality, even though there is no equalizer. bass is exceptional even on very "bassy" songs. 3.2" screen makes watching movies and shows much more comfortable. Zune also comes with AWESOME headphones. 
Cons:. stay away if you are a bass ADDICT. A bass eq would have been more preferable. battery life could have been a lot better. scared of breaking glass screen. 
Summary:. it is truly the BEST player out there. i have played around with and listened to other players, Zune outshines the rest.. 

$$;
Pros:. premium headphones sound great and its included free of charge, wireless syncing, good battery life, easy menus, $15 dollars a month music buffet makes it even more fun.. 
Cons:. need more accessories!. 
Summary:. I've been using this thing for a month now since i bought it. Its great and i use it everyday on my commute to and from work or wherever i go. Only one major problem i had when i first got it was, the new firmware had came out some weeks after i bought it and it crashed my zune but microsoft quicklly sent me a brand new one. Got the new firmware now and my zune is running on all gears. the only thing i regret was actually buyin the 80gb some weeks before the 120gb dropped for the same price but i never regret buying the zune. its just perfect! One thing that bothers me is that i cant find a good speaker dock for it. it seems as if apple ipod is on every company's merchandize saying ipod compatable. i wish zune will get more docks other than the ones they have right now cuz i bought the altec lansing mi414 and its not really very good and sometimes you just wanna put the headphones down but you dont wanna listen to it on something that doesnt sound or work right so whats the point? so i returned that speaker dock right away. now what i use is the zune home A/V pack. its connected to a sony cmt-bx5bt. Great sound it works perfect. so im happy with what i got so far. 

$$;
Pros:. 480i Huge DVD Quality screen, zune software/ device software,(3.0) Wi-Fi downloads, share music, photo's, podcast's (including Video) Zune pad navigation system,Charges quickly, and Memory capacity Plus customizable @ zune originals. wireless sync.. 
Cons:. Battery Life isn't bad, but could be better... lack of Features as in Contac's, Note's, Alarm Clock Equlizer etc., and you cant see the zune's clock unless your at the main menu. Network's have to be very close by for access (75 er so w/o walls). 
Summary:. Lack of sound quality, but better than the iPod if the iPod's Equalizer is Off, sound Quality is also better with the included Premium Headphones (Noise Cancelling is Great!, Shov'em in deep for quality). the wi-fi access can be a little bad for range (example, the iPod touch grab's my neighbors wi-fi, but the zune get only my home network), but load's album artwork and music previews alot faster than the iPod Touch, Game's that included are usually boring to me, but there actually fun! and the game's are jam packed with features as well, the typing (As in searching, or typing in your lock combo) is very Fun (weird but true) and faster than suspected. like i said battery life isin't much of an issue, but could be better, but compared to the iPod touch, the constant use of wi-fi can drain the iPod's battery to about 3-4 hr's in my experience, and the zune's battery is barely a difference, even with the the brightness on "High". I would say that iTunes is better than the Zune software, but the software is simple easy to use (If you have a fast Computer) and has a lot of Drag and Drop function, witch i think is great!, ability to make Auto Playlist's (As in Smart Playlist's for iTunes) and now with audiobooks with sevral sites, soon there will be more games avalible through the Zune Marketplace.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice big display, Superb audio quality, plays videos, podcasts etc. The wireless network syncing is great and its ease of use is awesome.. 
Cons:. Can't browse the internet even though this technically has an internal wi-fi antenna.. 
Summary:. One of the best MP3 players I have seen so far. It definitely does what it is supposed to do. Microsoft did a good job updating the design, it is certainly more durable than its predecessor. Thumbs up for this MP3 player all the way!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the Zune's minimalist and customizable interface, good battery life, Podcast support, FM radio, the entire social network aspect, Zune Marketplace, attractive design, large display screen, amazing sound quality. 
Cons:. No clock. No EQ, but this isn't a problem on devices with high sound quality. Also no free trial to Zune Marketplace anymore.. 
Summary:. I was an ardent iPod user for about 5 years before I bought a Zune. It was the lack of subscription services for the iPod that made me switch. Let me dispel some rumors that may be preventing your from buying a Zune.. Most (not all, but most) of the songs I bought from the iTunes store still play on my Zune. I'm not sure why some work and some don't, but the whole 'compatibility' issue really isn't that sever.. Also, I don't see the problem with Zune Marketplace. It's wonderful. Unlimited downloads for $15 a month, and I've yet to find an album that wasn't available (that was available elsewhere, like the iTunes store or Rhapsody).. If you're looking for something super simple to use without a cluttered excess of unnecessary features, get this.. 

$$;
Pros:. solid player, great SQ, sync is insanely fast, love autoplaylist, software is great, nothing to not like except eq. 
Cons:. No EQ, this was a dumb move. I almost didnt buy because of this. If the EQ is your only con, consider giving it a try, I was quite surprised.. much more solid than an Ipod, but not as pretty i guess.. 
Summary:. great great player, I was not expecting what I got, even after reading many many reviews. would be 10 with an EQ.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim form factor, 80G of storage, GUI, scratch-resistent back, large 3.2 glass display. 
Cons:. Zune Marketplace, lack of accessories. 
Summary:. The Zune 80 is Microsoft?s second generation MP3 device. Its first attempt to wrest MP3 market share from Apple was the 30G Zune which had its fans, but by and large was not successful. The Zune 80 is a slimmer, MP3 device with 80G of storage space for your videos, music and podcasts. With a price at $249 it is inevitable that comparisons are not made between the Zune 80 and the Ipod Classic (also priced at $249). Both have the same storage capacity of 80G, but that is where the similarities end. The Zune 80 has a larger, beautiful glass 3.2 inch screen which looks enormous compared to the Apple Ipod Classic 2.5 inch screen. The resolution is 320 by 240. Images are sharp, and bright, and the extra real estate makes it actually fun to watch a TV show, or a movie on the subway or the bus. I found myself squinting to see the tiny screen on an Ipod classic. The Zune 80 also carries forward the innovative features such as WIFI sharing, FM radio.. The Zune 80 came attractively packaged. What I liked was that right out of the box, there was music, video and podcast content already loaded on the player. I was able to experience right away the rich offerings of the Zune 80. I thought that was a nice touch. The Zune Marketplace (which is where Zune users buy songs and video content) has potential (especially in the Podcast space), but I found it slightly buggy. That would be one of my only grips with my Zune 80 experience.. With respect to the look of the Zune 80 I really like these words from a CNET reviewer "? the Zune 80 has this unapologetic square-nerd-sexy thing going on that just does it for me. It's like seeing Angelina Jolie in a pair of thick, black-rimmed glasses. Throw in custom etching and a cool background image, and this might be love.". All in all, I am extremely happy with my Zune 80. As a first time MP3 user, I find the Zune experience to be relatively pain-free, and, of course when I see another Zune user on the subway, that?s an added bonus..

Pros:. Sleek Design. Glass screen versus the plastic ones on the iPod (not including iPod Touch). Gorgeous screen. Squircle makes navigating so much easier than the iPod. Audio quality is better than the iPod, most people don't notice this though. Wi-Fi!!. 
Cons:. Lack of an EQ (equalizer). Lack of accessories on the market for the Zune.. Putting songs on a playlist is cumbersome.. Battery life is half of the iPod.. 
Summary:. After owning a variety of MP3 players, iPod, Creative Zen, Flash based, and Hard-Drive based, I must say the Zune smashes all competition. Even though the Zune has the same amount of pixels as the iPod, the pictures are still pretty good. Fine details get blurred and jagged edges, but hey- MP3 players are all about music.. Video quality is superb, but again fine detail is lost. The bigger screen makes it more comfortable to look at for long periods of time (movies).. The Zune does not freeze every 2 hours like the iPod. In fact, mine hasn't froze since I bought it (when it first came out).. Overall I am very pleased with this product. I highly recommend this to everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. hi-def 3.2" screen, wifi, updated software, sleeker dimensions, squircle nav. button. 
Cons:. Still No Bluetooth! , Microsoft poor backward compatability with accessories from 30 gb. 
Summary:. Hey it really irks me that Microsoft is still playing this game of backward compatability issues with previous zune accessories... ie..The a/v pack dock cradle wont fit my new 80 gb. What I say about that "Microsoft, your not the big kid on the block with MP3 players, dont make the few faithfull you have, buy all new accessories by not making them compatiblewith the newer versions of your players, come on". Ohh yeah, still would rather have this then any Ipod, but really no bluetooth, what the heck, look all around you...the blue wave cannot be denied...well except for maybe buy the new zune products. I rate this an 8.75 on a 1-10. 

$$;
Pros:. From what I've seen, everything. 
Cons:. From what I've heard, nothing. 
Summary:. Normally I read Cnet reviews objectively, take them with a grain of salt, try to keep the reviewer's personal bias in mind, and it all works out. But this time, Donald, you crossed the line. You didn't have anything to say about the zune that should really be considered a con at all. It is an mp3 player, not a freaking cell phone, if you want over-the-air purchases from your mp3 player you'll have to be ready to give up functionality and pick up an iPod Touch, and I don't think even that can stream music. The zune was not intended to be the all-in-one gadget you seem to be looking for, and I should remind you that in the event that mp3 players merge with cell phones and computers, you will be out of a job. Of course it is PC only, it is a Microsoft product. Most mp3 players are using a proprietary cable, suck it up. The Zune Marketplace doesn't need to offer video, you can download it from scores of other internet services. And lastly, you mentioned the iPod in your final statement. I don't even know how to respond to that, to hold the iPod as a measure of excellence in an mp3 player is taking bigotry to the next level, and certainly doesn't have a place on this site. Furthermore, the Zune is not an "iPod competitor," it is its own mp3 player, marketing to its own demographics and trying to fulfill their needs as best they can. And, might I say that anyone looking at your closing statement would never guess that you actually gave it a HIGHER rating than the #&#38;@^ing iPod.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big Screen, Zune Pad, 80gb, it's a Zune.. 
Cons:. The Zune 80 release date is 5 days away and I want one Now!. 
Summary:. I pefer to be different then be a clone!!!. Why would you want a Ipod knowing everyone has one? I can't deal with having the samething as everyone else, I like to be different and that's why I pick a Zune and when people see it they want to use it and touch it and say I want one. I love my old Zune but here come's the 80.. 

$$;
Pros:. bigger screen than ipod, wieghs less, the whole wifi sync thing, syncing with windows media center, and the new music sharing rules.. 
Cons:. just a little bit thicker than the ipod video. 
Summary:. this sounds cool because if you type in zune 2 on google you'll find a video that has a tutorial filmed at the presenting of it. Its cool because when you look at photos or videos it automatically changes the screnn display from verical to widesceen optimizing viewing enjoyment.. 

$$;
Pros:. everything else. 
Cons:. no touch support yet.. 
Summary:. great media player, a great alternative fo consumers.. 

$$;
Pros:. New touchpad "squircle" is def a huge plus over the 30; Huge menu to take advantage of the big screen.. 
Cons:. I would of expected a digital FM tuner; No gapless playback;. 
Summary:. Saw it first hand at an event in NY. The squircle pad is great. I believe this is a defininent upgrade over the 30 gb version. The bigger screen is great as well.. For those of you wondering why MS went with the metal back, it isn't because they wanted it to look like an iPod, it's to make it thinner.. 

$$;
Pros:. This feature is a great benefit. 
Cons:. The impression peole have against any NOT ipod. 
Summary:. The new Zune 80 will have full 720 line tv out featured and built in FM. Even without FM, the fact I can hook my zune up to a tv and watch the video could be very handy when I want to take a video to a presentation or use it in the classroom without having to burn a cd or dvd.. 

$$;
Pros:. 3.5" Screen, 30 hour Audio and 5 hour Video, 80 Gb, Wireless sharing and syncing (with zune dock), thinner than iPod Classic (Gasp!), Podcasting, Matte finish with better colors, etc. etc. etc.. 
Cons:. Still no Internet, Metal Backing.. 
Summary:. Well, i do own a Zune (1st generation), and it's music quality just kills the iPod! Not only is the screen bigger than the iTouch, but it has more pixels. 720 x 420 in 30 fps, and 720 x 580 (if i'm correct) at 25 fps. Not only have they added Podcasting (yeah!), you can sync music wirelessly from a dock. And the 80 gb model comes with Zune premium headphones (which alos i own and are really good).. All and all this is definetly a good MP3 player, while it may have some flaws, it most definitly will kill the iPod, and it's the Top Most wanted product on Cnet. =). 

$$;
Pros:. Big Screen, WiFi Sync, DVD output, Linked to ZuneSocial social site. 
Cons:. Full scale video content not available yet. 
Summary:. This is a great product which competes with iPod Classic. When compared to classic this products beats it in several category. It has a big screen which is almost as big as iPod Touch. It has WiFi sync and a unique touch sensitive touch pad.. Another noteworthy addition is a social site called ZuneSocial. It allows users to build tags similar to xBox. This tag keep track of favorite artists and top ten songs and so on.. A worthy option if you do not want to get caught up with iPod. 

$$;
Pros:. podcast support, user sharing, wirless sync, large LCD with HD display, great interface, FM radio, superior sound and video quality.. 
Cons:. no buying media from device, not compatible with Mac OS, no clock or game features, lac of accessories.. 
Summary:. My iPod broke a week after my apple-care plan ended, so in frustration I bought a Zune. Afterwards I realize that people buy the iPod as victims to fear of change, and smart brainwashing marketing schemes.. New generation iPods are either fairly lame interface with massive storage, or amazing interface with useless low amount of storage. The Zune offers a good mix of both.. I have it to set to wirelessly sync when I walk into my dorm room with it, which is amazingly easy and convenient. I can see detail on the big screen as well as watch High Definitions displayed videos.. The interface is practical, intuitive, and fun and easy. Although some people like the touch click wheel on iPods, which is understandable, but I found it too much and annoying. whipping my thumb around hundreds of times and then having it click 2 more times when I lift my fingers off. I find it easier to hold down until what you want comes up.. The FM radio is a neat perk to have added at no cost, I can listen to New England Sports Radio on the walk to class or work during Red Sox and Patriots season.. I have been able to find accessories that I desire, but not as easily, and the wireless sharing is another neat thing to have, although I have not done much of it.. Although many of ideas and features are copied from the iPod, the functionality and features outweigh the competition for the price. Microsoft has made another successful attempt at hardware following the X Box success, so if you are looking for a functional quality mp3 players, the 2nd gen Zune is a great choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large Glass Screen, Sleek doubleshot finish, 27% smaller than original Zune, Scratch-Resistant, FM Transmitter w/ RBDS, 80 GB of storage space, Wireless Syncing, Wireless Sharing, Batt. Life is great. 
Cons:. HD Storage, Somewhat small collection of music. 
Summary:. Very good. Lookin' to preorder this and I think MS has finally come with something good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge glass protected screen, large data capacity, superior sound quality, stylish controls and UI.. 
Cons:. Only one color, more varieties of sizes should be included, no games.. 
Summary:. In my honest opinion, the Zune 80 looks great and seems to be a nice competitor to the iPod. The screen is so much better to look at than the tiny iPod screen, and the controls look polished. One thing I hate is that theres no games, unlike the iPod. Of course I can see that Microsoft wanted to nail the multimedia part of the Zune, which it looks like it did. We'll have to see how consumers will react.. 

$$;
Pros:. MASSIVE screen, AWSOME UI, zune pad, automatic wireless pc syncing. 
Cons:. No additional features like a clock. 
Summary:. The zune 80 is easily the BEST MP3 around!!! Its sleeeek, got a huge screen perfect for watching movies and pics + a gr8 navigational input (the zune pad). 

$$;
Pros:. Bigger Screen, Better Codec Support, Improved Interface, New Marketplace, Podcast support. 
Cons:. Poor headphones, Zune-pad (?). 
Summary:. This looks promising to me. Microsoft is making incremental improvements with a bigger 3.2 inch glass screen, synch via wi-fi, better codec support(MPEG-4, H.264), and an improved interface. I also dig that the original Zune owners will get the new software and features (except H.264). The big question for me is how well they pull off the new store and podcast support.. Updated. on Jan 5, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Bigger screen then classic, wifi, wireless sync, smaller then old zune. 
Cons:. dunno, its made by microsoft, and its a bit big. 
Summary:. I was going to get the new ipod when it came out but the touch only has 16gb and the classic's screen is just to small to watch videos on, The zune has it all big screen+ big storage so im gettin one. 

$$;
Pros:. Not Apple. 
Cons:. None Yet (Gotta Git It First FOOL!!!). 
Summary:. battery life specs are in on the new Zunes, and they match up pretty well to the latest iPods. The Zune 80 will get 30 hours on audio and 4 hours on video, and the 4 and 8GB flash Zunes will get 24 hours audio and 4 hours video. In comparison, the 80GB iPod classic has 30/5 (equal in audio, one more hour in video), and the iPod Nanos get 24/5 (again, equal in audio but one up in video). You can chalk up that slightly worse video performance to the larger screens on the Zuneswhich wed prefer over a smaller screen and slightly longer life. [Zune Insider]. 

$$;
Pros:. Microsoft really fixed some of the problems that the first Zune had. New D-pad touch interface.. 
Cons:. Not on the device, but there is still no video marketplace.. 
Summary:. I think Microsoft really fixed problems that the first Zune had, such as the size.. It's really a great idea that Microsoft put that same firmware for the first Zune users as well(like me). I think that this can really be their official Music player. It's also cool that they got a new technology, the D-pad. It's cool because they got a new thing without stealing ideas from the ipod.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen. Good menu. Sound Quality. Podcast section. Packaged Headphones. 
Cons:. Hold button fragile. Complete shutdown complicated. Possible software failure. 
Summary:. First of all I've had this for a couple months and absolutely love it. It completely gets the job done, and since I run Windows, I find it supports music much better than the iPod.. Lets start with the bad:. I had purchased one from a retail outlet and got home, opened it up and started the setup, after it finishing, the software wouldn't even recognize itself and restarting it did nothing, it was stuck in a virtual endless loop. I don't think it is anything I did but who knows... I went back to where i bought it and showed them the problem, and they let me exchange it no problem, I had only purchased it a few hours prior. The next one worked/works perfectly. So it may have been a fluke.. I have had on a couple occasions the hold switch popping out on me while trying to shift it, all I had to do was pop it back in, but it's still a minor annoyance.. Another problem I had was battery life, it seemed to only last 1 day even when I had shut it down by holding the "play/pause" button. Well that doesn't really shut it down it only puts it to sleep I have come to find out. And no where in the instructions does it say how to do a complete shutdown. So here's the secret it's even hard to find online. You must hold the down arrow (by clicking in) and the back button at the same time for about 3 seconds and then it will shut down. This will allow you to preserve the battery.. Now to the pros:. I like the larger screen vs. the iPod. I realize that the resolution is the exact same, but at that small you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference. The screen is not grainy at all leading me to believe that the iPod has a better resolution it needs to get the job done looking correct.. I like the nice easy free menu. Personally it seems easier to navigate than the iPod's but that is just personal preference.. The sound quality is excellent, I am not a professional, but this really does the job well. The volume is also good, often in a quiet setting such as in my room by myself I only need the volume at level 1 and can hear it fine. If there is background noise I turn it to 4-5 and if I'm outside I set it somewhere between 8-11 but it is still considerably below its max volume of 20, so there should be no problems there. I'm sure you could be mowing the lawn and listening at the same time no problem except beware of hearing loss.. I like the menu for podcasts I never was into podcasts until I got this, first of all the Zune software is great and find new and quality podcasts, along with the ability to set your favorite podcasts of course. But the feature I like is the split between audio and video podcasts. This allows me to choose without thinking. I know that when I'm in a car that I just go to the audio section, since I should watch and drive. And when I'm in my room and want to watch something I can go lay down and and choose from the videos.. The packaged headphones are many times better than the ones that come with the iPod. They fit better in the ears, and have multiple sizes you can snap on to accommodate odd shaped ears. Disclaimer: I have stopped using the headphones in favor of over the ear headphones because Even though these are much more comfortable than iPod headphones, I still do not find any in ear headphones very comfortable.. Well those are my pro's and con's. When I started looking at a new mp3 play I initially looked at the iPod classic and was really kind of decided on that. but after coming across a comparison I started looking at the Zune more and eventually decided that the Zune was right for me. I consider it a great decision personally, even though I was enamored with the iPod, I allowed my self to look at something else, and it turned that there was better and I found it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I do not know. 
Cons:. I do not know. 
Summary:. this isnt so much about the actual product but did anybody else notice that comp usa is selling it for $1,113.07! a little over priced dont you think? I bet when they were putting down prices someone looked at the wrong product or else i do not think they will be selling much of them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy-to-use interface, large display, FM radio, ability to add album art without marketplace account.. 
Cons:. Average battery life, unnecessary scrolling required for main menu, screen dims too dark, limited video support, bloated Zune software is difficult to install.. 
Summary:. Overall, I recommend the Zune as a capable, perhaps even better, alternative to the iPod Classic. I am very happy I opted for the Zune rather than the iPod Classic when it came time to replace my dead old iPod back in May.. The primary difference between the two, at the time, seemed to be the FM radio feature. As I later discovered, the Zune also allowed me to add album art without signing up for a marketplace account, which can't be said for the iPod and iTunes. Unfortunately, the Zune display dims rather darkly, making it difficult to see said art.. Initially, I got the impression that the Zune player was not as sturdy as the iPod. However, after more than 6 months of regular use I've determined that it is just as sturdy, and is actually less prone to scratches. (Although I've read that the new 120GB model has a glossy finish, so so much for that!). My only big complaints are the lack of support for some video file types I have and the Zune software. The software quite literally takes forever to install, despite the fact it is a Microsoft program for a Microsoft product being installed on a Microsoft operating system. Once the painful installation process is over, though, the program seems slightly more agile than iTunes. (However, iTunes still has better playlist support.). A final note on accessories: The iPod is still king, so there aren't nearly as many accessories for the Zune. When I initially went looking for a protective case, for example, all I could find were a couple moderately exensive items. I opted for a clear Belkin case that just isn't that good. However, I've recently noticed a few more options out there, so don't opt for the iPod just for the goodies!. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent hardware , Loud sound, New UI for gen1 too. 
Cons:. Software dumbed down,. 
Summary:. The best past is getting all updates on gen 1 zune so it is as good as gen 2.. The few differences, Zune pad. tad smaller size. Clean glass screen. I got the gen 1 refurb for &lt;100$ is s steal for 30 gb of storage. (www.woot.com/buy.com). Gripes.. --------. The search function in software is crippled. now need to hit enter.. The Autoplaylists is cannot be made.. The 5* rating is disabled, instead a heart rating is given.. All gripes can be fixed, but now MS will stop listeneing...ance they feel thay have done the job.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of space. Fun to use. play with wallpaper. Premium headphones are good. sound quality is good. radio is good. has podcast. easy to scroll for music. 
Cons:. USB connection is proprietary. has to use zune software to transfer music, movie, and so on. battery life diminishes after several months. not much game app. the back is not scratch resistant. a bit bulky and a little heavy. 
Summary:. when I got my Zune 80gb, I was very excited and happy because I really wanted a music player that is not an ipod since almost everyone has one and I felt like I want to be different. I used it everywhere I go, which was why I accidently dropped it and the LCD screen didnt show anymore (that was my fault). So sent it to Zune and got another one. The second one I got I added lots of songs and videos, about 10gb songs and 3gb videos. After that, it started to become slow when I added my songs and video and podcast on it and it started to freeze randomly at times so I have to restart it. Then, it started to not even let me listen to my songs or podcast because it said that it wasn't synced in which I have synced and tried a few times unsyncing and syncing it back in, but it showed the same thing. I returned that one to Zune, and got my final Zune 80gb, by that time I was getting kind of tired putting all those songs and videos in it and started doubted myself in getting this rather than the ipod classic 80gb, but I was determined to use it to its full potential and try to enjoy the experience. A few months later, it showed the same problem that my second zune was having, it kept telling me that my songs or videos aren't there and my battery life was actually like 12hours instead of 24hours. I started to get some bugs somehow because it was difficult to sync my things into Zune with the Zune software. Maybe it was the software or maybe it the Zune, but by that time, I discovered that I have a limited amount of space to use my Zune 80gb. I could only about 1gb actually even less, like 75 songs or so I could only hear and 2 or 3 podcast and 2 or music videos. If I put anymore space on my Zune, it would act up and stop letting me play my songs and stuff and syncing would become very slow to the point where I don;t even know if it's actually syncing or not since it also started showing me a syncing error and so it would sync very slow and I have to wait to see if it will sync in or it's an error. I have lost pretty much faith in Zune products and felt that I should've gotten the ipod instead of this. The Zune was good AT FIRST, but after a few months, it starts acting up and I cant trust the reliability in Zune's anymore. If you want a good-lasting music player, look elsewhere.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice user interface. Small profile. Attractive look.. 
Cons:. Lacking mass storage device option. Need zune software to use usb and to charge.. 
Summary:. For the money, i would like a more do-all mp3 player then i have here.. 

$$;
Pros:. Brilliant display, great usability, nice software functionality, personalization options from the factory. 
Cons:. um, you knew what you were going up against.....fail. 
Summary:. The Zune would have been a great device five or six years ago. The device would be satisfying with a smaller price tag. I bought a 2nd gen zune when they first cam out and fell in love. I had some problems and sent it to microsoft, and it never worded right again. I sold it on craigs and bought an iphone 3g for 199.99. Lets just say that they made a believer out of me. 

$$;
Pros:. making more colors, and sizes. 
Cons:. touch pad.. 
Summary:. this definently needs to change. And i am refering to the touch pad.. 

$$;
Pros:. 3.2" screen,thinner,looks better. 
Cons:. Its made by microsoft,only 320x240 sreen Resolution,wi-fi somewhat pointless ,and no expansion slot. 
Summary:. if you want to get an ipod alternative go with creative,sandisk,or samsung and don't let microsoft have one more monopoly, and please stop reviewing it and wait until it's out yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. big screen, audio quality, "zune pad," fm radio. 
Cons:. COMPATIBILITY, wifi sharing is pointless, no iTunes compatibility. 
Summary:. overall this is a MUCH better device than the 1st gen zune, but still falls short of the iPod's wow factor. while the fm radio is nice, isn't the point in having an mp3 player to not have to listen to the radio? also not having iTunes compatibility is a huge disappointment. All my songs are iTunes purchased and not being able to sync them to a zune makes me happy that i bought an iPod video rather than a zune 2 years ago. 

$$;
Pros:. +Display. +Different viewing options. +create playlist on the go. +anything is better than the ipod. 
Cons:. -no sleep timer. -cannot play music while connected to PC through USB. -terrible software. -no EQ. -volume too low. 
Summary:. It does what it needs to, but theres a lot of important features to me that are missing. When I need to buy a new mp3 player, it will definitely NOT be a Zune or any generation or variation of it. I'll stick with Creative.. 

$$;
Pros:. Design interface, big screen. 
Cons:. That stupid black button is a poor man's clickwheel, proprietary marketplace and limited wifi applications. 
Summary:. This zune looks like the previous shiny black ipod. What does it offer that other's don't? Dont tell me that stupid "squirt" thing. The answer is: nothing. Microsoft didnt make this comply with their OWN Plays for sure standards, it wont work even with URGE!! And it introduced one more Zune store, which we really needed, coz iTunes, Amazon, Rhapsody, Napster, Sony, eMusic, etc weren't enough for us.. Compare this player to the Toshiba Gigabeat (which by the way, should really come out with a next gen soon) or the ipod, or with players by Creative, Sansa or Sony and this player doesn't stand a chance.. Lets talk about "squirt". Well I haven't had a chance to "squirt" my songs to anyone as I've yet to find anyone as stupid as me to buy a Zune. And just what the hell is "social"? Looks like Microsoft was thinking really hard as to what features they can add to this player and didnt come up with any good ones, so they just used the bad ones.. TO ALL ZUNE LOVERS: You obviously haven't used the Gigabeat - a much better Ipod alternative.. Also, Microsoft, please stop trying to be the jack of all trades and just concentrate on Vista. And also fire Steve Ballmer, he really pisses me off!. 

$$;
Pros:. I like that it's not Apple proprietary. I like that it's 80gb.. 
Cons:. I don't like the way it has a tendency to freeze, requiring a complete re-boot and reinstallation of all songs. And I hate the fact that each software iteration is worse than the one before it.. 
Summary:. If Zune does not recognize your CD, you may go in and edit the information (artist, album, song, etc.). There is a lot that Zune does not recognize, which requires a lot of editing. The editing is a tedious process. Zune keeps updating its software every so often, and with each iteration the difficulty of performing normal functions, such as editing, grows. With the current iteration, 3/4 of the time when you try to edit you go through the whole editing process, click "Finish," and are told "can't save now, try again later." Needless to say if you re-do it and try again later you get the same message, so basically you are precluded from editing information. If you've got an "unknown album" by and "unknown artist," you're stuck.. Long story short, the Zune is not a viable alternative to the iPod. I don't have any Apple products and will not buy any Apple products, but if Zune is to Microsoft as Product A-Z is to Apple, then Apple is by far the superior brand and company. I could not be any more disappointed by Microsoft's efforts as they relate to the Zune.. 

$$;
Pros:. only viable alternative to I-pod. 
Cons:. Terrible software installation issues.. 
Summary:. This might be a good player IF you can get the programs to work?. I suggest you look at the zune forum troubleshoot page if you don't belive me.. Not happy with it at all.. 

$$;
Pros:. the software is very easy. I love that i can put any format into zune software. Itunes is a huge problem for me. the album art is really easy to find and download.. 
Cons:. the zune audio player is a pile of junk. I have owned 6 Zunes and i kid you not!! all of them have died on me within a 2 month time period! the only one that actually lasted for more than 7 months was the 80 GB. the players freezed on me all the time. 
Summary:. dont buy zune audio players anymore since ive had 6 already. i gave them 6 chances to show me that they are worth something. im a pretty nice guy. after this last one. NO WAYY!. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge supply of free podcasts and great FM radio. 
Cons:. Totally dead after owning it for less than 2 weeks. From day one my Microsoft operating system told me it didn't recognize my Microsoft Zune everytime I tried to synch it until I reset the device each time. Then it died completely and lame support.. 
Summary:. All the cool features mean nothing if the player don't play. Just a headache.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not much, nice case design.. 
Cons:. "stunning, over-sized text" your reviewer wrote....does he have vision problems? This is one of the worst features of Zune, a silly copy of the same thing on Windows Media Center. Why make text go outside the frame of the viewer?. 
Summary:. I suspect the gushing reviews of this thing are from Microsoft sales people. Itried all weekend to make it work and returned it on Monday. Hopeless.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks like an Ipod/Iphone. 
Cons:. Microsoft sucks nowadays. 
Summary:. Looks like everyone trying to copy Apple, Why can't companies come out with their own ideas. I'm leaving Microsoft, heading over to the Apple camp.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was good until the software update. 
Cons:. Software update screwed mine up. 
Summary:. So this is the best forum I could think of to let people know how not to get screwed. I bought a 80 GB zune player a year ago and recently installed the new software and my zune player began to freeze so I tried resetting it and reinstalling the software etc... and now the screen went black but it still lights up so I called Microsoft/Zune about this problem I have been having since the software update and explained my situation and the only think that I was given was a "You may send your device in and we will replace it for $160 dollars because the warranty has run out". Why not repair it so I don't have to sell an arm and a leg to get something I have already paid for once. I could purchase a brand new 120 GB for $220 off of amazon for $60 more dollars I could have a new one with a bigger hard drive and a one year warranty to go along with it. This is a little ridiculous and unfair so I guess what i'm trying to get at is don't fall for Microsoft scam and be ripped off. I guess there is only a few options for me now I can post fourms and blogs and complain and maybe Microsoft will listen. I could get another zune player or replace my old one or I could just say "screw it" and cancel my subscription to the zune marketplace and buy an apple. Will see how this plays out.. 

$$;
Pros:. JOke.......................... ............... 
Cons:. JOke.......................... ................... 
Summary:. I go to a very large university and I have seen maybe 3 people in thousands use one of these stupid microsoft p.o.c. Nobody believes you microsoft this is not the real #1 wanted product on CNET. ( Id rather own a Kia blender) THis is another crappy marketing scheme to fool you into thinking you would want one of these plastic vista things. Get a clue Microsoft your days are numbered.. 

$$;
Pros:. looks good, big screen. 
Cons:. cant use it. 
Summary:. When i got my zune the screen was cracked. i called Microsoft and the told me they cant do any thing, it was my fault. so now i have a $300 black piece of crap.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice size screen. 
Cons:. the whole black design, bulk. 
Summary:. don't care what this thing can do.... if u walk around with this.. Thing. . and like a crazy headphone u looks like a social outcast nerd.
