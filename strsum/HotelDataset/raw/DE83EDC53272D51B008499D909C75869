to be honest , from the tripadvisor comments prior to our visit , we would not have booked to stay there .
however , another local b & b who did not have a room available recommended we try it .
we were not disappointed as the host gill was very helpful and friendly and the accommodation was more than adequate for our needs .
we had the twin room at the front of wren lodge on the ground floor which was nicely furnished , had a flat screen tv , tea and coffee making facilities and an en-suite shower room .
admittedly there were some querky aspects to the accommodation with a very small wash hand basin and the toilet tucked into a narrow gap between the shower cubicle and the wall , but neither of these features caused us a problem although it might for some .
wren lodge is within a 5 to 10 minute walk of st albans city centre and also local to the railway station .
there is obvious train activity until around midnight and some passing revellers at the front as they wind there way home from a good night out but unless you are want to be in bed by 10 .
00pm this should n't be an issue .
the breakfast menu consisted of fruit juices , various cereals , fresh fruit salad , various cheeses , eggs the way you like them , toast , homemade jams and marmalade , selection of yoghurts , tea and coffee .
perfect start to the day and gill always happy . . .

all in all , we had a very enjoyable 2 nights stay at wren lodge and would encourage others to do the same .
compared to many other alternatives in the area , wren lodge is an excellent option.
