this is a great camp , with amazing views of the crater and typical & beyond first rate service .
the camp has its oddities : the décor was so over the top , that it took something away from the experience— i felt like i was in a weird richard burton film .
( the tree camp portion of the camp seemed to have a much nicer lodge with a more toned down feel .
) .
the rooms were also really nice , but again , a bit over the top .
( also , while it was fine for us since our kids are older and could avoid the room while the others were showering , the lack of privacy in the bathroom could be an issue for other families ) .
the grounds of the camp and the views were really fantastic .
the manager , daniel , was very nice , though he was quieter and less outgoing than other & beyond camp managers .
our guide , kitoi was excellent .
while we were only there two nights , our youngest ended up playing kitoi and all of the other guides in intense board games in the bar in throughout the evening .
also , because of the larger bar area and the way the camp put out snacks and drinks at the bar , this camp really fostered interaction among the guests which was great .
in terms of the crater itself , it is definitely worth seeing as its very different from the serengeti ( and other locations ) , but one full day at the crater . . .

in terms of the crater itself , it is definitely worth seeing as its very different from the serengeti ( and other locations ) , but one full day at the crater is sufficient after being able to get so close to the animals in the other camps , the few roads at the crater were a bit frustrating at times.
