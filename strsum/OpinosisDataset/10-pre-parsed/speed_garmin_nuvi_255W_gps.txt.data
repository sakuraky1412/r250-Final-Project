local speed limit sometimes were not correct,then we would pass a speed limit sign & it would correct itself .

showing actual speed is nice ,  especially for the little women, as she loves to remind me along the way .

if it helps me avoid one speeding ticket it will have paid for itself .

speed of calculation, accuracy, and simplicity of operation are top notch .

,  speed of map updates is awesome .

plus you can download speed cameras alerts at http :

the turn or exit instructions happen too close to the turns or exits when at highway speeds .

that's what the car's speedometer is for .

some countries impose lower speed limit in residential areas .

and, it's nice that the garmin tells you that, at your current speed, you'll reach your destination in 43 minutes .
