i use it for a backup camera for weddings as i can keep it on my belt    small lenses and pickup sensors mean low light will never be up to bigger camcorders  .
in normal light the pictures are just as good though  .
the software supplied is best not used    do this    .
remove the sd card and plug it into your pc or mac (may need a card reader)  .
copy the mts files to your hdd  .
use ulead , sony or premiere    all the later versions will import the mts video/sound files  .
i use them with mpg2 hd files from my larger sony hd camcorder .
replace your old tape video camera and get one of these  .
you can get some good deals on this  .
where do i start  .
the ultra    sleek , compact and lightweight design  .
the canon 15x hd video lens , 1920 x 1080 full hd recording , canon face detection or the 24p cinema mode  .
i love this cam head to toe  .
updated  .
on dec 9 , 2009  .
i would definitely recommend this product  .
with good lighting (outdoors) , the picture quality is incredible  .
it's relatively light , and 15x zoom is not amazing , but does not hold it back  .
has plenty of settings to help you get what you want out of it  .
if you're willing to pay the price , you'll be happy with your purchase .
this camera is simply amazing  .
the picture quality you get from this camera makes you feel like you're filming a big budget motion picture and simple things around the house become amazing to look at  .
the camera is small and very easy to hold in your hand and the lcd screen is easy to navigate which makes the multiple pages of settings a no brainer  .
this camera also gives you three different framerate options which gives you very different feels to your filming  .
basically what i'm saying is if you're looking to buy a new hd video camera buy the canon vixia hf200  .
it's perfect for upgrading to hd and you're going to be able to do so much with this camera and not spend thousands of dollars  .
although it does not include internal memory sdhc cards are easy to come by .
if you feel like you need extensive built    in memory , then go with it's sister , the hf20  .
however , i cannot think of a better suited camcorder for the consumer who's looking for extensive features and awesome hd quality , all for a relatively low price .
i purchased a sony handycam sd camera before this one  .
i thought the resolution is horrible and is very displeased at the fact that older vhs videos had better quality than the final product of the sony handycam  .
i returned the handycam and did thorough research prior to buying another camcorder  .
i is sold on canon's great reputation and just had to decide on which camcorder is best for my needs i recently had a child and wanted a camera which is a versatile as my needs  .
i decided to go with this camcorder because of the high reviews and the lightweight of the camera  .
i purchased it in a kit at costco for $569  .
plenty of power and features for me  .
i love the quality and with a little toying around , the features become easier to use  .
a few things one should know when reading the reviews regarding pixela (the included software program) , i noticed that people had problems with it  .
i have a sony vaio laptop which is about 3 years old  .
though a bit slow , it gets the job done  .
to break it down , this is the process to download load the program and then to websites to share with the world 1  .
download the software to the computer  .
shoot a test video  .
connect the camera via the usb cord (provided)  .
once connected to your computer , press the button on the lower right hand side of the lcd screen on the camcorder 5  .
select the option to connect to computer on lcd screen 6  .
once selected , the pixela program will open and transfer videos from your card to the pixela library 7  .
from the library , you can either burn blu    ray copies , edit , or select file and export the videos to a place where you can get to them to upload to the internet  .
i did this and the video is great for all to see , including my out    of    state family this is how far i got and i just received the camcorder yesterday  .
once i master the other features , i will update some more  .
bottom line , do not be intimidated by the reviews of the software , this is a great camera which will last for years .
simple to get wonderful results .
very good pro  .
quality  .
mediumish price  .
acceptable for people filming projects  .
overkill for home movies .
i have not had time to really use the camera but i am impressed at how small and light weight it is .
i found the picture quality to be perfect to my untrained eye  .
absolutely beautiful  .
the 15x zoom surprised me it is superior to the sony sr47 (sd) that i purchased at fry's and took back for store credit and upgraded to hd  .
even at 60x digital zoom , the image stabilization is better than the sony sr47 optical i zoomed in to 60x on a tv relay tower and could hold the zoom stable enough to count the cables on the receivers at a couple hundred yards  .
for someone used to sd , zooming in to 15x on some tree or flower in hd causes one to tear up  .
it's just that beautiful stereo sound is fine though not 5  1 dolby you could do better if you upped the price to $1200 but the picture quality couldn't be improved at all  .
it doesn't get any better  .
i had a panasonic sd9 hd camera in 2008 and took it back dissatisfied with picture quality and ate the $75 restocking fee  .
i won't be taking back the canon hf200 though it lacks some features i'd like to have , i'm unwilling to pay much more for them  .
this canon fulfills my minimum expectations perfectly and exceeds them by far in picture quality , zoom and image stabilization if you want a great hd picture quality at the lowest price this will fill the bill  .
and if you pay $8 , 000  .
00 for a professional hd rig it still wo not give you better picture quality  .
significantly better picture quality is not offered on this planet (maybe you could get 1% better for 8g's)  .
however , you can and will get 40% worse picture quality for about $200 dollars less one downside to hd cameras in general is the hidden cost of ownership  .
i now need a new computer my 5 year old hp cannot quite handle the processing load required by hd files  .
and now my 720p sony rear projection tv is inadequate for 1080p so i have to buy a new super duper lcd tv well , i'd have to get them anyway sometime .
i purchased this camera at dell canada for $699 can  .
now on for $10 less  .
that is a great deal after shopping around  .
love the sdhc flash card method , and purchased a 16 and an 8 gb card  .
if fits in my jacket pocket  .
and my chubby fingers have no problems with the controls  .
wow  .
more later after i have lived with the little darlin' for a month or so .
because of the format , i think this camcorder will be around for a while and i hope my next computer will make editing easier than it is now overall i am satisfied with the purchase i selected .
yes , i would do the purchase , once again  .
at least judging from what i know now  .
of course , do not expect the quality you get from a sony pmw    ex1 and the likes of it (usd 7000 upwards , sales taxes included) but it's very close under ideal light conditions and/or if you use the excellent manual overrides for white balance , exposure etc .
mts file format has amazing quality at a great file size but i wanted something that is ready to edit out of the camera imovie and premiere pro cs4 (cs4 only nothing before) will convert it but i moved away from dv tapes so i did not have the real time upload the conversion is almost real time , some times longer for the price i would wait until it drops i would feel like i am getting a deal at $400 but feel a little unsatisfied at $600 but it is still am amazing camera .
i'd recommend this camera to the micro    budget filmmaker  .
i'm not sure if i can post a link here , but here's a 7 minute documentary i shot with it  .
it is mostly indoors and with low light    .

overall this is a great purchase  .
it is a gift for my wife and we had been shopping for cameras for 12    18 months  .
this has all of the features that a couple with young kids needs in terms of zoom , speed , size , ease of use  .
having a fully flash memory camera is a must for us because of the ease of having many 16 gig cards with us  .
the battery life is plentiful and all of the functions are there for a reason and work well  .
there are a lot of other cameras out there that have some similarities in features but none of them put together the whole package quite as well as cannon does on this one  .
great job cannon .
for the cost of it is expecting something better fromn canon .
no one should buy this camera without completely understanding its format  .
you will be disapointed  .
hard to burn standard dvds  .
you will find most of your friends will need a blu ray or hd player  .
the dw    100 burner does not write to sd  .
cannot burn dvds from flash card , format for dvd    r only , so you are out of luck if your computer burner does not burn    r  .
i will have to buy a external burner now , to burn dvds  .
be sure you understand camera before buying .
i bought this camera based on expert reviews about the video quality and features for the price range  .
there were a number of user reviews complaining about poor quality for subjects in motion  .
i decided to try this camera , for the main puropose of motion recording  .
after fiddling with all the features and instruction booklet for about a week i decided to record a couple clips of fast moving objects , at the highest setting , and check out the quality  .
after transferring the clips the my pc , i played them back  .
the motion parts were awful  .
anything moving is blurry  .
hooked it up to an hdtv and same result  .
i should have listened to the complaints  .
the camera is in the box to be returned within an hour the only other complaint i have is you need to connect the power cord to interface with a pc in any way , no matter what the status of the battery is .
not good if you mostly shoot inddor .
failed on critical recording during one time event  .
buffer overflow message and hf200 locked up till battery exhausted  .
no files or data on card , totally corrupted  .
if it is old type with tape , video would be there up to point of failure  .
so much for new technology .
