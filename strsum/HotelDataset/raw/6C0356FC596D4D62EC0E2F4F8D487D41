nice lady at tourist info called the hotel for us when we arrived , and the shuttle bus came along in about 20 mins .
we arrived early after a connecting flight from vegas so really appreciated the fact that we were allowed to check in early .
good clean room , overlooking the car park , but it was quiet .
room had tea and coffee facilities which was really good as we 'd been in vegas for 10 days before that and not had any .
the hotel has a small pool , but even though it 's small , it 's very nice and was n't over-crowded .
the hotel also has a self-service launderette which we needed and appreciated , and a small business center .
apart from the complimentary airport shuttle , they also have a complimentary shuttle to two local malls which was great .
there is also an ihop and olive garden in walking distance .
in the evening we asked how much a taxi should be for center but no one at reception could tell us how much a taxi should be and looked at us as if we were mad when we said we did n't have our own car : / .
we ended up getting the bus into town and an over-priced taxi to come back in as public transport seemed to stop at 10pm : ( check out was easy enough and whilst inquiring about taxis again we lucked out and the lady on reception got us on a shuttle serviced . . .
