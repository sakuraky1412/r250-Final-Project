Pros:. Video quality is amazing and the cross menu is so user friendly.. 
Cons:. Doesn't have an eject button on remote.. 

$$;
Pros:. EXCELLENT VIDEO QUALITY. SMALL FOOTPRINT. FACE OF PLAYER IS VERY CLEAN.. 
Cons:. NONE THAT I HAVE NOTICED. 
Summary:. I'M SICK OF READING REVIEWS OF THIS PLAYER WHERE PEOPLE ARE KNOCKING THAT THERE'S NO EJECT BUTTON ON THE REMOTE! IF THE PLAYER'S REMOTE DID HAVE AN EJECT BUTTON WOULD IT ALSO TAKE THE DISC OUT FOR YOU? NO, YOU HAVE TO GET UP! SO WHEN U GET UP PUSH THE EJECT BUTTON ON THE PLAYER ITSELF. AND PEOPLE ALSO KNOCKING THIS PLAYER FOR NOT HAVING WI-FI, DON'T BUY THIS ONE THEN. IT'S NOT A CON OF THIS PLAYER, IF YOU WANT WI-FI, BUY A PLAYER WITH IT!!. Updated. on Dec 28, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-ray image quality, it works, nice on-screen interface, no unnecessary features.. 
Cons:. The remote, DVD upscaling could be better.. 
Summary:. Fantastic player! I don't think that it was given a fair rating. Am I the only one who buys a blu-ray player to play blu-rays? While it may be a nice idea to include all sorts of streaming features, it would seem as if none of the manufacturers can get those players right. If you research, you will find that Panasonic's players, while really nice, will randomly pause movies for 5 to 10 seconds. Samsung players have to be unplugged and plugged back in to keep the Netflix streaming working, and so on. If you're looking for a nice blu-ray player that just works, you should check this one out!. 

$$;
Pros:. Some people indicate that it is not backward compatible - I can not speak to other formats, but it works with my sharp aquos which has 1.2a hdmi inputs.. Easy menu structure to use, very easy setup.. Unit stays very cool when playing a disc.. 
Cons:. None that I see so far.. 
Summary:. I was just looking for a straight forward blu ray player (I really don't care about the BD live stuff and haven't used it yet). For the price of $150 CDN at Best Buy it does what I want for a good price.. Watched a normal DVD on the upscale tonight and it looked great as well.. This was very easy to setup through an HDMI connection, remote is pretty simple. I am impressed so far.. 

$$;
Pros:. overall performance consider not bad.. 
Cons:. Abit bulky .. but most of the BD player in the market is bulky too.. 
Summary:. looking forward to have some moving visualization function during usb mp3 , wma play back . Some thing like in window media player.. web browser is an intresting feature to be in home video product now.. 

$$;
Pros:. New firmware ALLOWS for internet video streaming (YouTube and Netflix). Video quality is excellent (I'm using a Sony XBR TV). I didn't mind the recessed USB port, my run of the mill Kingston thumb stick fit without issue. Auto-updates its firmware.. 
Cons:. No eject button on the remote. Ironically, the remote for my Sony TV (which is designed to work with multiple external inputs) also lacks an eject button. The load times could be faster, but they are tolerable.. 
Summary:. Great BD player. Its major flaw (maybe an issue Sony has on a larger scale) is the lack of an eject button on the remote. I'm happy with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. with excellent video quality on Blu-ray movies, Sony and Samsung Blu-ray players are both excellent Blu-ray player choices. I recommend you to check out http://www.squidoo.com/best-blu-ray-player for information on the best and cheap Blu-ray players.. 
Cons:. It didn't have the streaming video function.. 
Summary:. Sony is still my top choice of Blu-ray player along with Samsung.. 

$$;
Pros:. I am using the player in conjunction with a Sony TV and sound system. It works great, and BD films are amazing. The player is quiet, and it has an option within the player to check for and install firmware updates.. 
Cons:. No complaints. It does last streaming, but I think that it is overrated anyway because the quality of the streaming UIs on most devices is very poor (compared to Apple TV, Xbox, or a Mac/PC). I got the player for $99.98. A great buy.. 
Summary:. I would recommend this product, especially if you can get it for under $100.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is excellent. I have not noticed a moment of jitter so far.. 
Cons:. Would have liked some internet access through the player.. 
Summary:. Sony never make a dud product. When the price is right they cant be beat.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Sony bdp-s360 is an excellent bluray player if you are looking for a solid great looking player with execellent bluray quality play back and built in Dolby True-HD &#38; DTS Master Audio through hdmi. No lipsync issues, jaggies, or other.. 
Cons:. Standard DVD playback quality is good but not the best. I compared it to my previous Toshiba HD DVD A35 player, also my Xbox 360 and both were superior to the 360 when it came to dvd quality playback. Remote has no eject feature and minor functions.. 
Summary:. The Sony bdp-s360 is a great bluray player, but with all the competition out there that offers more bells &#38; whistles it's hard to recommend it. However, if you are just looking for a solid, great looking player with excellent Bluray video quality, great sound, good dvd upscale quality, and no eject feature on the remote then this player is for you. I personally prefer Sony movie disk players thats why I made the purchase. I WOULD HAVE RATED THIS 5 STARS, BUT IT ONLY GOT 4 STARS DUE TO THE BASIC REMOTE CONTROL WITH LACK OF THE EJECT &#38; MUTE BUTTON(S).. From now until July,6 2009 amazon offer free Sony Blu-ray Player with Purchase of Select Samsung HDTVs. credit : http://review-samsung-lcd-tv.blogspot.com/. 

$$;
Pros:. Quiet Operation, Nice Design, Good Value, BD Live Capable, Onboard DTS TrueHD and MA, Compact, PQ and AQ. 
Cons:. Loading times are just OK, No Eject button on Remote, Sluggish performance on more complex menus. 
Summary:. For $250, I thought that this player was inexpensive and carried a good value. The player was ready for BD Live out of the box and had Onboard decoding for DTS TrueHD and MA which the S350 didn't have. I also found that the player was smaller compared to the S350 and had a nicer design. It was also extremely quiet compared to my PS3. The PQ and AQ was quite impressive.. This player also had some problems. The PQ and AQ's performance was impressive, but one thing that Sony failed to deliver was the loading times. The loading times were just OK, but pretty slow compared to my PS3. There was also no eject button on the remote, but that can be easily resolved by borrowing or purchasing a remote from the S350. Navigating through more complex menus was also a little sluggish, but simple ones were fine. Overall, I thought that this player was great for the price and I recommend it for anybody looking for an affordable BD player with impressive PQ and AQ.. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredible performance on BluRay discs and also on regular DVD's. Upscaling regular DVD's is great and surpasses my other regular DVD player. Great Sound and very fast loading time for HD discs,also very reasonable priced.. 
Cons:. Looks not as well built as my SP-300 and lacks analog 7-1 outputs.. 
Summary:. I like the player a lot and do not care for streaming capabilities or internet connection. I use these player for playing movies in my home theatre. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture, stills and output options. Also will use a external HD for BD-live content.. 
Cons:. Loose the remote and your screwed.. No streaming audio or Internet movie access.. 
Summary:. I try to stay away from Sony products because of their stance DRM. I've had more problems with that crap. But for the price, this was an excellent entry player and the price of $99 was just right. I haven't tried it yet, but according to Sony's support site it will support and external hard drive for Blue Ray live content. Right now I'm using a 16GB flash key that seems to work great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to operate.. 
Cons:. I am wondering if there is a problem with my player or with my cable. A few times I have put in a DVD from Red Box and my tv will say looking for signal and the screen goes blue. I never had this issue before I got the DVD player. Any suggestions?. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture quality is very good and the sound was easy to hook up to our amplifier. I like the fact the kids can't eject the discs out of the player from the remote, and I like the flip down face and style.. 
Cons:. Didn't realize I needed a USB memory stick in the back of the player to use some of the Blu-Ray features, otherwise I have been happy with this player which was included when we purchased our TV.. 
Summary:. Overall for our first Blu-Ray this has really converted us to the new media. We don't feel the DVD playback is as good as it could be, so we suffer a little when watching regular DVDs. Don't kid yourself, you can tell the difference between Blu-Ray and DVD. If we had to purchase a player, we probably would have gotten a model with more features (like streaming NetFlix and with on-board memory).. 

$$;
Pros:. Design is good, nice and thin, connections are adequate, and after only having viewed one Blu Ray disc, I was happy with video quality and everything seemed to work, and as I didn't pay a fortune for it, my expectations weren't very high.. 
Cons:. No eject button on the remote??? The 'Home' setup menu is harder to navigate than it has to be. The 'Home' screen comes up when you turn unit on and doesn't go away until you insert a disk....would be nice to make it disappear.. 
Summary:. The Setup menus are kind of cumbersome and not user friendly...I'll survive but not sure my wife can. This is my second Sony DVD player and I'm surprised the remotes are kind of cheap looking and they don't have an eject button. Might seem like a nit, but when every other manufacturer in the world seems to have an eject function on the remote, you wonder how much trouble or expense it could be for Sony to add one. It's nice to finish your movie, hit the eject on a remote, and walk up to retrieve your disc, rather than turn the lights up to find the unlit button on the unit. When you first turn the unit on, the "Home" screen (setup) comes on but you can't get rid of it until you insert a disc. I've hit every button on the remote, looked in the operator guide, went to the web for help.....couldn't find anything that would lose the annoying screen. Maybe not the biggest problem as such, BUT when you are watching a movie and press the Home button to change a setup feature or if you hit it by accident, you can't get rid of it, you have to eject your movie an reinstall it. This may be design intent or just a messed up player, but after reading the scare stories about internet firmware updates (turns your unit into a brick), I'm exchanging my Sony for a Samsung, Panasonic, LG...anything but Sony Blu-Ray.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price, Small profile, Easy menu navigation. 
Cons:. No eject button on provided remote, HDMI output is not backwards compatable. 
Summary:. Overall, for my first BD player, I'm mostly satisfied. The player is small, easy to hook up and easy to setup. The picture quality is exceptional (as I expected) and things are good. Once I got everything hooked up and working, that is.. The problem with this model (and others, I suspect) is that the HDMI 1.3 implementation in the player is NOT backwards compatable. When I connect the player to my 2004 built HDTV (reported to use HDMI 1.1), the player does not even recognize that an HDMI capable device is connected to it. No video is displayed on the screen except for the power-on splash screen, which disappears as the player initializes.. When I connect a slightly newer LCD TV (possibly HDMI 1.2) to the player, it recognizes the TV as being connected, but does not display any video other than the initial power-on splash screen. It does follow any changes in the output mode of the player. 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p signal inputs are all reported by the TV, but there's no video.. Since Sony is one of the creators of the HDMI specification, I am perplexed why they would make a player that does not have the backwards compatibility that is reported by every HDMI site I have visited. Fortunately, my TV does have component video inputs, so I can still get 1080i video (the best this TV will display) and I'm happy with it. I just am tired of "built-in obsolescence" when it's not supposed to be there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture when it works.. 
Cons:. The player frequently refuses to load movies. Other times the sound totally stops, and the disc has to be ejected and reloaded to get the sound to come back. Tthe remote is often unreponsive also.. 
Summary:. I wanted a lower end bluray player to replace an old DVD player so I could watch prerecorded high def movies on my new Sony HDTV. From the first the Sony s360 was unreliable. Though easy to connect and use, about 1/3 of the time it fails to either load or finish playing without an audio/vido malfunction. This happens not only with regular DVDs but also with bluray movies. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the problem since very often movies that will load one night, will not load or play properly the next. Some discs never load at all. If your Sony is unreliable and within the one year manufacturer's warranty you can get a free refurbished unit. I did not know this, and since I am two weeks past the warranty date, I must pay $123+tax. Since I can pay a new bluray player from a different manufacturer for a little more than that, I am going to go in that direction.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works for movies at home, but in a internet netflx streaming world.. 
Cons:. Why bother. Costs the same or more as players that will stream netflix, I spoke with a clerk at the store (wal-mart) about the samsung, vizio and this model. Got this model because the others were gone. The others will play netflixs for $20 less.. 
Summary:. Look elsewhere. There are plenty of choices in the same price range that will do more.. 

$$;
Pros:. Audio and Video are excellent.. 
Cons:. Unusable for playing newly released Blu-Ray movies as the firmware has not been updated since 10/2019. Sony does not appear to be supporting this player.. Customer support is poor.. 
Summary:. Do not buy this unit if you wish to watch Blu-ray Movies.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like very little about this machine. I had a Sony BDP S300 for more than a year. This 3rd-generation model is not much better. It is smaller and lighter and a little bit faster, but it's still agonizing waiting for it to get going.. 
Cons:. Still GLACIALLY slow to start up and load disks. It's only just noticeably faster than the first-generation Sony BDP S300 that it replaced.. 
Summary:. My main complaints WERE the ones above but now, after less than two months, it is refusing to play most of the Blu-ray disks in my library while it plays DVD's without complaint. Yes, they're all official releases, and yes, I upgraded the firmware to the latest version yesterday. I just HAD to come here and tell anywone who will listen how PISSED I am at Sony, the originators of Blu-ray, making two such DISMAL products and convincing me to buy them!. I bought an LG for about the same price today (sorry, I forget the model). Honest, I don't work for them or have anything to gain from promoting them. But their machine is MILES ahead of the 360, no contest whatsoever! The several movies I've tried (startup only) have been in progress within about 1/3 to 1/4 of the time the Sony takes!! This is the way it SHOULD work, with performance close to the DVD player I used to have. Plus with a network connection the LG plays YouTube videos, very cool, and has software that lets me serve pictures and videos from any computer on my network.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has good picture quality. 
Cons:. Slow, and to get some Blu-Ray discs to play you have to keep manually reloading the disc after each time it says cannot read the disc, eventually it will play. Contacted Sony tech support they said cause it is new tech it is to be expected Huh???. 
Summary:. The player is just ok with major flaws be it the fault of new technology i.e. Blu-Ray, producers putting out movies with non standard code, or Sony's way of either blowing off the consumer, or inability to stay up to speed with technology. My suggestion is to steer clear of this unit, look at Samsung or LG!!.
