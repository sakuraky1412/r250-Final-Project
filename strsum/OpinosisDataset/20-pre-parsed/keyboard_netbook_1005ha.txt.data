keyboard feels funny at first, but you get used to it .

i like the keyboard, i like the speakers .

the only comparable keyboards i found were those on much larger laptops .

small keyboard with some double, function keys

keyboard is not as sturdy as i would like has some minor flex

excellent keyboard for typing .

,  keyboard feels well laid out

the keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .

has a very long battery life, runs videos and multimedia smoothly without issues, fast loading, very usable keyboard, stylish sleek design, decent pricing for what you get

my keyboard also seems a bit noisy .

keyboard is actually nice to work on  connected to my wireless network immediately  light, weight of course .

windows started crashing, freezing, unable to boot, keyboard or touchpad not working, etc .

however, two weeks in, the keyboard would sporadically stop working .

it's 90% size keyboard doesn't take too long to get used to .

only 10, inch screen, small keyboard and no cd, rom .

the keyboard really works for me .

for regular typing, the keyboard has worked well .

to use, , clunky mouse buttons, a too, small keyboard .

like how they made keyboard as large as possible unlike qosmio 17  which is almost same size .

my biggest concern was how i would handle a smaller keyboard .
