i like this product because you can do everything on this device  .

chek you e    mail , msn , chek a webpage , playing music video's and games etc i love this product  .

great product  .

5 out of 5 stars  .

bottom line  .

buy if looking for a the iphone without the iphone restrictions  .

sell if lookng for simple mp3 player or dislike apple an example of this technology is that i'm using it to write a review .

best mp3 player  .

use it everyday  .

its like a personal computer with everything on it .

itouch is a good player but its too expensive features are great but somehow lacks something  .

maybe because , apple dont want to put the all    nice    features cause it might be more saleable than the iphone .

the best mobile internet device you can get and nintendo dsi and sony psp should be scared .

its made by apple that alone is sweet but this product is an over the top perfect mp3 web    browsing power pda machine  .

as of last february , i have not had a working ipod since my nano broke then  .

last month , my dad got this awesome music player as a gift for getting good grades on my last report card and i love it soooo much  .

i can now watch tv and movies when i'm traveling  .

) i highly recommend  .

this is by far the coolest thing ive ever owned  .

it has everthing you would ever need and more as an ipod (except maybe a bigger hd)  .

its great for listening to music or audiobooks , surfing the web , checking email , stocks , weather , scores , anything you'd need is there for you  .

it has almost made me want to stop using my 120 gb ipod classic because of how much more it offers than just music or video  .

its a unbelievable deal for the price and i highly recommend it .

until i actually started investigating the features it is just another i pod (great) after i used it awhile awesome  .

worth the $260 .

the bottom    line is that the ipod touch 2nd gen is one of the best ipod and gadgets ever .

note   my ipod has the 3  .

0 update i recommend getting it its $10 you can find it in the app store but im sure they will ask you to get it when you first sync into itunes well were to start this little thing can do so much it blows my mind  .

i is never a fan of apple but this is truly amazing  .

the applications (apps for short) realy steals the show  .

between apps for buying and selling stock , using twitter , and a secure place to store passwords this can do it all  .

now , some apps cost money some are free (it usualy just small things the free versions show adds while paid versions dont and come with mabey a few other features) i have used mainly free apps with the occasional paid app now you can browse the internet but it dose put a strain on your eyes i is supprised to findout that the internet is faster on the ipod touch then the iphone now , if you wanted to for some extra money you could get the skype app ( and a headset) and a text app and you got your self a primative phone which i thought is cool now the only major issue is if you dont have wi    fi you wont be able to get your apps updated without pluging your ipod into a computer and the app store/itunes will be kind of worthless  .

and others are saying it dose not work with a secured network that may be the case , i havent come accross a secured network yet so im not sure as for sound quality its the headphones i use my trusty $10 sony headphones and they are much better then the apple headphones so i give it 10/10 but you have to remeber thats including the 3  .

0 update and daily wi    fi accsese and just to add im sorry for any spelling errors just had to rush this review .

first of all , the interface is very designed completely around the touch and rotation of the device , and is done in a very nice way making user interaction very enjoyable  .

not to mention it's very stylish in it's design graphically  .

i've dropped it a few times (seeing somewhat of a klutz) and have yet to break it (surprisingly) and the apps are wonderful , this device is nearly a hand held gaming device as well as a simple mp3/movie player  .

but is not that what we expect from apple  .

quality product , completely worth the money i guess sacrificing size sacrifices battery life  .

it will run for a very long time if it's just playing music , and as long as it's in lock you do not have to worry  .

but it will only run for a few hours if you are playing games or using apps , but nothing wroth not getting one .

i got this program called sharepod you just drag music from your computer into the program when ipod is plugged in  .

you can use music from cds or free music at www  .

beemp3  .

com  .

i'm not sure where i got it , just try typing it into google  .

as for the battery life , when your not going to be in wi    fi for a while , go into settings and turn wi    fi off  .

it saves power  .

also   to save pictures on a website or something , just hold your finger on it for a few seconds  .

also , hold the home button and power button to take a screenshot  .

that's been very useful  .

movies are a bit expensive , but you can rent them for a couple dollars  .

buy it a sams club if you want to save $15  .

thats right , its only $214  .

74 , at least it is when i bought mine  .

sorry if my review isnt in the same format as all the others  .

hope i helped  .

~flaming llama  .

firstly , i think they undersell this by calling it an mp3 or mp4 player    it is so much more  .

yes , it can do those things , but for me it has become more of a pocket internet device , a living atlas , phonebook / addressbook , contact database , pda and a portable lifelink to email , weather (in any city) and just about everything else  .

heck , i practically forgort this thing does music and video (and have not really missed them either) the apps this is one of the most entertaining and interesting things  .

you can get or buy an app for just about every conceivable function and frill    need a flashlight  .

get an app need to know where to find the nearest el polo loco  .

get an app want to track every move of your favorite sports franchise in real time  .

get an app i've been able to to find apps that help me edit my photos , build a contact list that interfaces with my maps email addresses    and a lot of other niceties yes , much of this is frivolous , but fun nonetheless  .

with more than a handful of usefull app    add    ons (and a ton of frivolous    but    fun ones) , i've fashioned this ipod into a pocket instrument i'd rather not live without  .

i absolutely love being able to pop into any coffee shop (or mcdonalds) and quickly connnect to the internet    check my email or maybe surf a little ; and all this without having to pull the laptop out of the trunk pop it open  .

i love being able to pull up an app , ask for the nearest steakhouse (or dentist) , and not only getting a list (sorted my distance)    but a map and satellite / sidewalk view of it , along with the phone number and website url ironically , it's turned out to be one of my least favorite music and video devices    because i'm fed up with itunes and the forced synching methods they impose  .

i love the videos , and the large screen makes it great for photo browsing , so i've probably got about twenty or thirty videos on it (and a ton of photos)  .

that , and a handful of songs one thing i'd recommend for those considering a purchase    go ahead and fork out for a quality screen protector  .

i got the one of the best (and most expensive) one out there  .

it's been worth every dime because they are everything they claim to be radio    the touch gives you unlimited radio of every possible genre  .

yes , you need to be in wifi range for this , but it's fantastic and fun  .

at home , i actually use this to stream internet radio to my home system    from my home pc to my touch    and the touch plugged    in to the aux input of my home audio system  .

all you need is a well    chosen radio app (and there are tons of them) you'll find plenty of excellent (free and paid) apps for radio streaming ; most of which will allow you to access hundreds of stations , of every conceivable genre  .

the paid apps in this category range from 99 cents to a few dollars , all worth it in my view shopping    yes , (free) shopping apps for this and it makes it easy to log in for a quick check and easy purchase , from where ever you happen to be  .

as to email , i've found a nice , tight integration with my yahoo mail account which is also integrated seamlessly with my flickr photostream  .

fantastic  .

note of interest i love how online reviews always slam the heck out of apple competitors , etc , whenever they review an 8gb mp3/mp4 player a ridiculously limited amount pathetically low storage for a video player , etc  .

; yet they never say these things when reviewing an 8gb ipod  .

well , i'm here to say that 8gb is just as little (or as much) with an ipod but that in this case , it matters even less to me this device cost me around $230 , and for the reasons explained here , is worth every thin dime  .

awesome gadget , i love how apple packed so much into this device , yet it still runs with perfection .

before i bought the ipod touch i owned a palm tx the ipod touch is better by far  .

i use it for everything  .

im a sophmore in highschool in highschool and most of my teachers let me use it for notes , i use quick office to write research papers , and i never have to use aflash drive because of the memory stick app  .

also the graphing calculator helps with my geometry class  .

i've been reading other reviews and alot people are saing that the keybord is hard to use or is too cramped but i havent had any problem with it  .

overall its great as a pda and you can use it like an iphone with the voip apps though you do have to be in range of wifi to use it .

the best mp3 on the market i love it  .

everyone i know gets one apart from one person who got an arcos but not regrets it and want's an ipod touch  .

it has got all the features dat a good music listener needs .

tech junkies , it's a must have  .

all hail itouch  .

i love this little gadget because their is not a reason to not love it    it does just about everything , perfectly  .

the ipod touch is no longer in the same league as mp3 players  .

final statement   do not think of this gadget as an ipod/mp3 , think of it as a computer in your pocket  .

i loved it and is very good product for gamers  .

updated  .

on jul 8 , 2009  .

i love this product  .

this is my first ipod i have ever purchased  .

im glad i waited this long to finally purchase one  .

i think this is a great product for a tech savvy person  .

i have used my ipod touch since the very first day i got it  .

although i purchased the 8gb model , i iisten to pandora radio so i dont have to purchase any songs or use up my memory  .

i got the deal where my purchase included a $50  .

00 gift certificate to best buy and the spore origins game  .

i used the gift certificate to purchase a wireless g    router  .

if you have a dsl internet connection i suggest you invest in a wireless router so you can experience the ipod touches full capabilities  .

they trick you in to buying the phones by making them look like they can float on water where as the reality is they do not period  .

the ipod touch is great  .

great for everything  .

it is really good for music and video  .

the main thing for me though are the apps  .

they have apps for everything  .

you can even get apps that let you text and make phone calls for free  .

the internet on this is great which is also a big thing for me  .

if you want an amazing music player then get this  .

it has a stopwatch , alarm , calendar , and calculator that come with it and if you don't like those , just go to the app store and get better ones  .

i recommend it if you want a device that can do pretty much anything but not if you want something really basic that only plays music  .

my experience with it has been good and i do not regret buying one at all .

i really like mine  .

wireless works great  .

zoom is great  .

this is my third ipod and the best yet .

the ability to carry applications is amazing and theres a app for everything  .

apples empire will never fall  .

before i got the ipod touch 2nd generation 8gb , i is stuck with the ipod shuffle 1st generation 512kb  .

when i told my friends they would laugh at me  .

once i got the ipod touch i is completely blown away by it's capabilities  .

this more of a portable extreme gaming pc instead of a mp3 and pv player  .

it sports a arm11 chip that is 53 mhz faster than the pentium iii in the dell dimension xps t500 my six    year    old sister had  .

it plays music very nicely and you do not need the genius feature to create a playlist  .

i is in my local best buy store here about week ago  .

i is just going to look around a bit , just to see if they had any great sales  .

then i ran into a best buy sale person  .

first we were talking about computers then he pulled out a ipod touch out of his pocket  .

me not being an apple person i thought he is going to bore me out of my mind  .

he started showing me all of the amazing things that the ipod touch can do  .

that's all it took , i is sold  .

i had to buy one  .

i know this ipod has mp3 capability , pictures and video , witch is all great but i did not buy it for that  .

i bought it for the wi    fi , internet and e    mail  .

the wi    fi is great and i can take it anywhere there is a wi    fi hot spot , plus connect it to my wireless internet connection at home and at work  .

the touch interface is great , and all of the free applications that you can download from itunes are great also this is the best portable device i have ever bought  .

i highly recommend the ipod touch  .

near perfect device scratch issues and fingerprint but what do you expect  .

this device act it came from the future .

this is an overall multimedia power house  .

although it's sound quality is really on the border of average depending upon what music you might listen to , it's very pleasing with higher end ear buds it's screen is bright , and easy to see in any sunlight  .

also perfect for viewing videos when your killing time , rather it be youtube or your own videos converted and put on the player battery life is fairly good  .

i've seen people complain about this in many places , but when i did a calibration (drained it first , then charged it full) it seemed to last me a long time the appstore is getting better and better with programs like comic zeal you can read comic books you may have in cbr or cbz format on your ipod touch , and it actually looks and runs great stanza book reader makes it to where you can buy , download , or put your own novels/books onto your touch and read it on the go lots of good games out there that are both free and cheap this multimedia power house murders anything else out there  .

if you cannot afford an iphone (like me) , this is a great alternative to the same great experience .

i did not care for the iphone when i looked at them  .

so i got a different phone and the ipod touch  .

now that i have used it for a few days , i'm wishing i would have just gotten the iphone instead of both others .

i got my ipod touch 8gb for christmas and i'm already in love with it  .

this thing has everything  .

i put all my music , videos and photos and still have tons of room to spare  .

even though i didn't buy it , the price is finally not outrageous  .

the music options are great  .

cover flow is great looking and you have itunes built right in if you ever have the urge to buy a song  .

photos look amazing on the touch  .

its fun to look through your pictures and its easy to resize them or change them  .

pictures can be easily taken from the internet or there are great apps that give you tons of wallpapers  .

videos look their best on the touch  .

from your own librabry of movies to clips on youtube , not many devices can compete with this  .

the safari web browser looks like a real browser on this ipod  .

it loads very fast and switches to landscape no problem  .

email is a piece of cake to use  .

with many different emails (yahoo , gmail , aol , etc) built in , you can get to your inbox in nothing flat  .

and finally , the app store  .

with the app store , you can browse thousands of useful applitcations , many which are free  .

the games are very fun , and not just the paid ones  .

apps like scribble and linerider are endless fun  .

there are apps like myspace , cnet , facebook , rss feeder and more  .

the possibilities are endless now the bad  .

there are very few things that can be done to improve this machine  .

one of things is fm radio  .

i don't see why this is not possible , it might just make the ipod a bit thicker  .

the second thing is the back of the ipod  .

this looks great for the first five minutes  .

if you do not buy a case , the back with be scratched and ugly in no time  .

apple has made every other ipod and the iphone lose this easy to scratch surface  .

brushed aluminum anyone  .

please fix this apple  .

the last con is the need of itunes  .

and i know it sounds selfish , but come on , you know it would be amazing if you had the option (without using some program) to put files on it like a jumpdrive  .

but i cannot complain  .

i might never get a different device as long as i have this ipod touch  .

i'm actually on it right now updated  .

on dec 27 , 2008  .

i cannot say enough about this ipod  .

it truly is the funnest (not funniest) ipod ever  .

the apps you can buy from the app store are great for when you are bored , and when you are in a wi    fi hot spot , the ipod has many more great features and apps  .

the safari web browser is the best mobile web browser i have ever seen (better than the lg voyager) , and is easy to use  .

the touch screen is extremely responsive , however it gets a lot of fingerprints on it  .

i would definitely recommend buying a screen protector and an inexpensive case , one about $10  .

the picture and video quality is also amazing , and it is actually enjoyable to watch videos and pictures on it's 3  .

5 inch super sharp display  .

my only complaint is the battery life is used up in one day if you do not have the ipod in standby mode playing music .

it's the best ipod on the market , the desgin , function , software is perfect , if you spend and extra 20 minutes you can have streaming video and the basically makes the ipod touch a pocket pc or the equivent of the macbook air , so buy the touch if you want to be in ipod heaven .

greatest thing that has ever happened to the united states since 1776 .

if your looking for a great multi media player but do not care for the phone , this is the one too get .

easily the best mp3 player out there because of it's easy of use and presentation of a wide range of viewing/listening options keep this in mind when complaining about the price    .

the item is multi    functional i use mine as a calendar , email device , i read powerpoints , surf the web , play games , buy ebay items , check my contacts and literally so much more  .

the app store is what makes the difference here no other mp3 player even comes close to adding useful features that actually work smoothly and easily  .

the best part about this device is that it is not limited to just music  .

videos/photos fly with ease and games are actually not bad  .

but i am a medical student and i needed a tool to quickly access information on the go (wifi) as well as easy access to my email and calendar  .

if you have an imac or macbook , you'd be crazy not to get this device the added benefit of an external speaker is a huge plus  .

i use it as an alarm , and now i can show my friends songs that i like without having to pass around headphones one at a time (you'd be surprised how often people ask me to show off the speaker) my only 'wish    list' items (not complaints , because this ipod is nearly perfect)    .

i do not need a microphone (but i want to use shazaam  .

) maybe on the next gen  .

fix the silver backing and make something less scratch prone  .

add a higher gb model (32gb is not enough)  .

overall , i would buy this ipod over and over again  .

my parents bought one after seeing its calendar use (my parents are disabled and track doctor appointments) and my brother bought one after seeing that the games were actually pretty cool  .

i bought it because it would help me with my education try to name another portable , slim device that you can keep in your pocket with 32gb of storage and still jog with it i sold my 80gb ipod video for this 32gb ipod touch and i never once regretted it my grades have improved too  .

touch is in its own kind  .

no one else has yet come up with another mp3 player that can do what it's capable of doing need a simple music player  .

then get a ipod nano or iriver or zune for that matter , craving more but not willing to give in to at t  .

get the ipod touch and you wo not regret .

i went from ipod nano (2nd generation) to this , this is the best mp3 player ever  .

you can surf internet , watch youtube , and once u get used to the keyboard you can type pretty easily , if you dont have it buy it , if you have good earphones besides apples older earbuds you will be able to hear it amazingly clear , you will hear details that youve never heard before , if you want a good mp3 player , buy this one at $229  .

i have both an iphone and a touch and both are two of the best consumer products i have ever used  .

battery could be better for both , but as far as mp3 players go       why would you get anything without a touch screen  .

best creation of the mp3 world  .

the diverse capabilities that the itouch provides at a very fair price is incredible  .

the added capabilities that are expanding daily in the apps store is just unbelievable and put the apple itouch in a class by itself (add the iphone) .

i owned the first generation touch and now just a week ago purchased the newest generation  .

its even smaller , has a built in speaker and a lower price  .

the app store in itunes is just growing and growing  .

it's really great as there is tons of free +pay software  .

if you look around on the market there is nothing really close to it  .

i have seen a lot of people replacing there pda's with the touch  .

great product  .

this ipod can do one of the most unthinkable things that you would never think is on an ipod or any mp3 player for that .

the ipod touch is a very sexy device  .

the touch screen is amazing  .

built in speaker , volume controls and tapered design is the new features of the 2 gen  .

the built in safar web browser is my favorite thing about the ipod touch  .

it is sooo easy to use and pretty fast too  .

i think 229 dollars is a reasonable price for something that can do this much  .

the storage capacity is a little small for the 229 version with only 8 gigs , but if you want to pay 70 dollars more you can buy the 16 gig model or 399 for the 32  .

apps store makes the ipod complete  .

there are so many useful applications that you can download and some are even free  .

i purchased the first ipod touch at 399 for 16 gigs , but i just thought the whole thing is not worth the money  .

so when i heard about the updates apple made i thought i'd give it another try  .

i went and bought the 32 gig touch twice the size as the original ipod touch , but the same price  .

the first thing i noticed is the design  .

it feels a lot more sturdy , but thinner than the first  .

the contoured shape feels really nice in my hand  .

the screen is as gorgeous as ever with a 3  .

5 inch widescreen  .

the volume control is a nice convenient feature as well as the external speaker  .

the external speaker is not great quality or anything , but just produces a sound for casual listening great for sharing youtube videos and songs  .

with the added app store , i can play games , get a to do list , organize my finances , etc  .

i realized it is now completely identical to the iphone except the phone part of course  .

this is like my mini pda  .

the only complaint i have is that the back has that polish that attracts fingerprints  .

it has not scratched on me yet , but being careful until a case comes out for it i feel this is definitely worth the purchase now and will be keeping this great and entertaining device for a long time  .

like i said before its the mp3 player best buy of the decade  .

i love the screen layout its simple and adaptable for a no brainer  .

the web browser is great in picture quality  .

its durable i droped it like 8 times from 3 to 4 feet  .

just buy it because almost everybody has one .

the ipod touch has pros , cons , and features i admire  .

one pro of this ipod is the number of songs it can hold ; on eight gb itouch can hold 1 , 750 songs  .

more pros are , using the internet with a wi    fi connection , and buying apps from the app store , which also needs a wi    fi connection  .

also , the battery lasts long and it doesn  .

t break easily , i have dropped my itouch many times and it still works perfectly  .

there aren  .

t a lot of cons but there are a few  .

you need a wi    fi connection to use the internet , and sometimes you can  .

t find one  .

also , the screen gets dirty too quickly  .

my favorite features are the apps , youtube , and the number of songs it can hold  .

so i recommend you buy this music player if you need one , because it has more pros than cons , and it has many great features .

i like the whole device but sure there could be a few more things added  .

they should've made it an iphone without phone capability and sold it for a bit more expensive  .

like a camera , built in mic , and the iphone has a much better speaker than that of the ipod touch  .

but overall it's not only the funnest but the best ipod ever .

overall , this is by far the best music player on the market  .

the price is great , full of features , and has all of the standard ipod features that we all have became a custom to  .

the volume rocker buttons on the side are a great improvement , they make changing the volume fast and easy without having to light up the screen  .

the external speaker is just outstanding compared to other mp3 players  .

multi    touch screen blows the competition away  .

the option to use a microphone is also a plus (although they could have included one built in)  .

they battery life of the player is incredible when the screen is off  .

it seems like it'll just keep on playing forever  .

but when the screen is on , it drains it  .

the processing speeds of the mp3 are not that great  .

sometimes it will lag up on you  .

apple has still yet to integrate a fm tuner into their products  .

the blutooth device inside is strictly for use with the nike+ (which by the way , is an amazing feature) , but if your going to include a blutooth device , why not take it to the next step and include obex file transfer , so we can share pictures with cell phones and such  .

also the cover flow needs to have an option to be turned off  .

it is the most annoying thing about the ipod  .

many times i will try to change the song while im holding it at an angle and the over flow will automatically come up but , overall this is an awesome mp3 player but i don't quite understand why cnet said something about being too difficult for some users or having too many features for users who want only audio players  .

like what is that  .

uh hello there's other models that only include those features  .

its not like they only offer the most advanced technologies and don't offer a standard , bottom line model  .

like seriously  .

i guess cnet just could not think of anything else to whine about  .

oh well i'd recommend this ipod to anyone .

i have not had a working ipod since last february when my 2 generation nano broke  .

i've been saving up for this neat device since  .

i would definitely reccommend this to a friend or a family member  .

it's worth the $$  .

ok so i own a blackberry storm and i loved it , until i purchased the ipod touch  .

i know i do not have the phone function but it is already better than my storm (so ashamed of saying , sorry crackberry  .

) my storm lags and it's not fluid when switching from different apps or different menus , and the touch is completely opposite so smooth  .

i hope all the rumors about the iphone coming to verizon next year are true i think a lot of dedicated verizon customers that own the storm may want the same as well  .

keeping my fingers crossed  .

overall , it is a very fun toy to have  .

highly recommended  .

if you like games , you can find just about any game on the app store .

i must preface this review by saying i didn't have to pay for my ipod touch because i got it free from http  //www  .

referrer_id  768069 for completing some surveys (try it if you haven't , it's an easy way to get free things)  .

anyway , the ipod touch is the best phone       no , the best electronic device       i've ever owned  .

the apps available are amazing  .

but till , it's primarily a media device and that is where it excels  .

video and music playback are so much fun the the ipod touch , and that is an understatement the device itself is very durable  .

especially the screen  .

it's one of the best touch screens i've used  .

i'm fairly confident it is going to last and not go dead or develop blind spots like so many other devices i've used in the past the user interface is sleek , just like the physical phone itself  .

it's a matter of pride to own such a great piece of kit if you do not have an ipod touch  .

why not  .

buy one now  .

or , you could just get one for free from http  //www  .

referrer_id  768069 like i did .

power saver mode extends batter life and is best for advanced music listeners or tech savy  .

buy it right meow  .

i prefer this over the iphone 3g as it has bettery battery life and i use a different cell phone anyway  .

a nice large screen that bright and brillant  .

and at least with a new ipod touch and only playing music , it actually gets the advertised battery life of 36 hours  .

of course this is only playing music for 36 hours straight  .

no idea yet as to video  .

apple says that it should be 10 hours  .

but , even with the long battery life , it would be nice to change out the battery in a pinch when you are not around an outlet  .

music quality is great  .

as well as the video quality  .

but 8gb only holds so much unless you pay a lot more  .

it would have been nice to be able to stick in a micro sd card  .

being able to use it with more than just music and videos with the apps via the itunes store , you can almost use the ipod touch for anything  .

and there are lot of free apps in the store so you do not have to spend a fortune  .

also with many wifi places around , you can still surf the internet and get e    mail i cannot wait for the new 3  .

0 software update , even if you have to pay for it , just for the bluetooth audio alone i is considering a sony walkman , especially with the equivalent music quality , longer battery life and cheaper , i prefer my ipod touch for all the other things it can do .

ever since 2001's 5gb ipod , the whole music world has changed , but now , apple makes an mp3 player that you can browse the internet with  .

all the other past problems like the lack of a voice recorder and fm radio are all taken care of by the app store  .

have you ever imagined 3 years ago that you can send/ recieve e    mails on your music player  .

apple has really hit a home    run with this product  .

they rolled anything you could want all into one ipod  .

with a huge list of features , it's hard to beat .

there is much to like and little to dislike with the ipod touch 2g  .

however , the cons are important  .

the ipod touch's strength is definitely not in audio quality  .

it also does not have bluetooth even though rumors have said apple included it with the player but locked it  .

the itunes store is more for the likes of steve jobs than us normal folks , so i would recommend some p2p software if you want an ipod touch 2g or any other ipod  .

a small disappointment would be no wireless syncing , which competitors zune have  .

here is my point of view  .

if you are looking for the best all    around mp4 player in which you get a little bit of everything , go for the ipod touch  .

if you want an mp4 player that focuses on audio quality , has bluetooth , and you do not mind a smaller screen (3 ) and are on a budget , take the samsung p2  .

both players i heavily recommend  .

i hope my review helped in letting you know the best choice for mp4 players .

it is a way to the future , just like the retired concord sonic airplanes , only this one , i am very optimistic , it will live on and be improved as the year comes  .

if you had an ipod before , this is much much more  .

internet browser is the best out there on any phone or portable device  .

thousands and thousands of programs/applications are available , many free  .

great games , utilities , etc i use it as an ipod , wireless testing device , internet browser , rss reader  .

read the news , weather and more daily on it  .

if you end up using it all day like i do you will want a portable battery charging device that you can carry and plug in to recharge as the battery life when using wireless and video a lot is poor and battery is not removable .

honestly , this is an amazing piece of technology  .

many , many years ahead of other products  .

it's pathetic and a shame how other loser companies  try  to imitate the ipod touch , iphone the ipod touch is really moving from mp3 player to mp3 player/pocket pc , which is a great thing because not only can it handle videos , mp3 music , podcasts , rss , and wi    fi it can also do things other handheld mp3 players cant definately if you are searching for an mp3 player , and have a good budget of $229 , buy this product apple co  .

is that one company that is always light years ahead of the competition  .

no actually there is no competition with apple co  .

, and their ipods there have been confirmed rumors that apple co  .

is developing the next    generation ipods  .

all i can say is that if we were working on another ipod , it would not be like anything you would have imagined    unannounced apple employee  .

so , to end things off this is a must buy  .

dont buy the first generation ipod touch  .

it looks boring and plain apple is amazing always go apple  .

though slightly expensive and does not have much storage , if you want a pvp that has good battery life , great sound quality , a killer app store , great games , amazing video quality , and the best os you'll see on an mp3/pvp , this is for you .

i just got my touch today (for christmas) and i love it  .

i really wish i could connect to wifi in my house  .

it already has a scratch or two on the back , but i am getting a case for it , so it's not that big of a problem  .

the battery has already died today , but that could be from me playing with it so much  .

there are so many cool things on here  .

you should definitely get one  .

updated  .

on dec 25 , 2008  .

i got this new ipod to replace my 1st gen touch which had a cracked screen  .

after comparing the two together , i noticed that the 1st gen seemed to pick up more wifi networks than the new one  .

also the settings menu has a bluish tint to it  .

the speaker is quiet , but is meant to be used for casual listening  .

the battery life is pretty good and the faster processor speed is noticeable  .

even if this seems like a mild upgrade to the 1st gen , it feels like a totally new device .

one of my favorite gadgets by far , it's slim , useful , entertaining , sleek , and often a life    saver  .

i just wish it could go longer between charges .

i recently upgraded from a ipod nano 1g and have been blown away by how good this device (ipod touch 2g) is  .

it does everything i need and more  .

the built in speaker is a nice thing to have when you want to listen to music with others  .

having the ability to connect to the internet is excellent although leaving the wifi on at all times is a bad idea since it seems to run the battery down quite a bit and when its time to charge it be sure you set aside a good hour or so because it takes forever  .

the screen perfect although it takes some getting use to if you have big fingers like myself  .

it also attracts tons of fingerprints (along with the back) i advise you invest in a good case for it you'll need it  .

overall i believe this is the best mp3 player out right now and will be for years to come well worth the $227 price tag (8g) if you have the chance to upgrade or get a new device get this you wont be disappointed .

i wanted an iphone but am stuck in a 2    year contract with another carrier  .

i picked up the 16gb ipod touch and couldn't be happier  .

right now apple is positioning it as a portable gaming device , but is so much more than that  .

it is a mini    computer , pda , and has all the functionality of an ipod  .

there is always something new to download in the app store  .

i could not be happier .

if it were a choice between shoes for your kids or the 8gb ipod touch , let the children go barefoot .

the itouch is a lifesaver  .

i use it for everything  .

i'm a junior in high school and i use my ipod everyday  .

most of my teachers do not mind and are actually intrested  .

in my algebra 2 class , i downloaded a free graphing calculator from the app store  .

it works great and is always correct  .

you can zoom in and out by pinching and trace by double tapping the screen  .

i also have the instapaper application which helps you with writing essays and doing research by saving web pages on your ipod  .

you can view without wifi and it makes bibliographys and work cited a lot easier  .

the scientific calculator works great with chemistry but it costs $  .

99 to download a periodic table  .

you can also download a unit converter to convert from customary to metric  .

i have a  .

english and i downloaded a dictionary app that helps a lot  .

i also have the constitution and the d  .

on it for my a  .

history  .

i also have a program called iprocrastinate which acts like my personal assistant  .

it is better than an average homework planner  .

i have all my assignments in there and you can have it arranged in many ways  .

parents , buy this for your kid  .

it raised my grade up and makes school less stressful .

i owned an ipod touch 1st gen , i gave it away after i got the 2nd gen  .

2nd gen is a slimmer , better looking piece of gadget  .

the integrated speakers and volume control buttons are highly desirable integrated speaker allows me to listen to my music when i am tiring of using earphone after long hours , volume control buttons allow easy access to volume (the most common use function) without switching on the screen , in a way it is conserving the battery integration of various new applications are highly appreciated as well now , i can use ipod to access the facebook , mailbox , map and etc it is so user friendly as the pages has been specifically designed for ipod touch and iphone in addition , various free utilities applications have made my ipod my best companion as it just like a pda (although not as good as a real pda) that helps to organize my stuffs  .

my biggest disappointment in ipod touch most probably is it cannot read pdf and word documents  .

some have suggested some brilliant ideas so ipod touch can read pdfs and word documents but from my point of view , this is just too tedious and complicated  .

i am hoping they will introduce new itune and applications that allow ipod touch preview pdf file lastly , stock earphone is just not good enough , pretty disappointed with the sound quality  .

just wondering why cant they provide a better pair of earphone  .

i end up spending extra money to buy a new pair of sennheiser well , it sounds a lot better now   )  .

giving it 4 and a half due to (1) cheaper (2) better applications (3) build in speaker (4) integrated volume control button (5) gorgeous looking  .

i could have given 5 stars if it allows me read pdf and a better pair of earphone   ) for those that have a worn    out ipod touch 1st gen , this definitely is a good upgrade .

the ipod touch or itouch is probobly my best use of money ever  .

its the only product that i have no trouble finding and not loosing and my experiances with it have expanded  .

if your lookin for a good ipod for music videos/ videos/ music/ pictures/ wifi surfing and so much more this will be a great purchase  .

so far i had my ipod for a week and love it  .

prior to getting the touch i is not a big ipod fan and did whatever i could to stay away  .

since my purchase i have enjoyed every moment  .

the touch screen is very responsive and easy to use  .

since i never owned an ipod i could not compare it to any other ipod  .

the different application available for download and the wi    fi is a plus for me in my purchase  .

like someone already mentioned , you get cheated out 1gb from preloaded application and software so you ready get 7gb not 8gb  .

the battery life sucks compared to my other mp3 players  .

if you listen to music and have the screen off you can listen to a entire day of continuous music  .

if you searching the net , playing games , or watching movies , you might get 5 hr of battery life before you have to charge  .

the large screen is a plus when watching movies and the graphics are excellent  .

so far no dead spots on the screen from me touching it  .

i have a total of 581 songs and 7 full movies loaded on my ipod touch  .

i have 345 mb remaining memory  .

since i have much more music i like to add i  .

m looking to sell the 8gb and get the 16gb or i can just delete some of my movies as add them at will  .

i would recommended this ipod to others that are looking for a great mp3 player with lots of fun  .

beware battery life is short if watching movies , playing game , surfing the net  .

i gave the player a 4  .

5 star based on the battery life  .

i would have rated it higher if the battery life did not stink so bad when watching movies  .

the ipod touch is similar to my dell laptop in many ways it has wireless internet , and many other amazing features  .

excellent buy except for the youtube issue mentioned  .

if anyone has a workaround this one let me know else be cautious before handing it to your kids  .

i is surprised how this feature bypassed the parental control , but parents do take caution and doubly test it before handing it to your kids i have a 10 and 12 year old and i have blocked out youtube have installed aim texting widget (freebie) and they can text me anytime from home and also receive texts while logged in (does not alert they have a text) without having to get a phone plan .

it is a great investment  .

it is a music player , internet browser and gaming system all in one  .

it is great if you like surfing the internet on the go or listening to music in general  .

be careful not to drop it  .

the external speaker is great if you want to listen to music hands free or to share music with friends  .

it is not shock resistant  .

and be sure to put a passcode lock on it  .

the products should not be too expensive it is a great mp3 player but it a bit too expensive  .

brillant mp3/video/wifi portable device i call it a mini computer that has disabled options overall it is great  .

get it if you like calling texting get a iphone  .

best mp3 player but alot of money but its worth it  .

this ipod is a great option for people which want a responsive , not    too complicated music player , which also has extras , like internet radio  .

just make sure that you get a case , because the bugger sure is slippery .

got it as a present       looks like a keeper  .

i use it for e    mail , as a reference tool at work (er) , for minor web browsing , and as an e    book reader  .

this last deserves mention , although i don't see it frequently mentioned  .

there are tens of thousands of books available for free download , and thousands more for sale  .

an average e    book file is less than 500 k , so you can fit literally thousands of books on this device  .

it's not quite the same experience as reading a real book , but you cannot fit even a single book in your pocket , much less thousands  .

you can adjust the font to whatever size you want , it's backlit , so the lighting doesn't matter , and you always have something to read the one thing i don't do with it is use it as an mp3 player  .

my cell phone is smaller , easier to carry when i run , has the same memory (8 gb microsd card) and works with stereo bluetooth headphones  .

i find the earbuds tend to fall out when you do anything active , and i mostly listen to music when i'm running or at the gym the main flaw i find in the basic user interface is the inconsistent implementation of the landscape format  .

one of the big strengths of this platform is its ability to sense which way is up and adjust the screen to that  .

you can thus view most applications in either portrait or landscape format  .

one of the big advantages of the landscape view is that it gives you a keyboard that's big enough to actually use with reasonable facility  .

given that , it's surprising to see that apple chose not to allow the landscape format in some of the basic applications that are the most typing intensive for example , the default mail application only functions in portrait mode , not landscape  .

unless you've got pencil    thin thumbs , this makes typing nearly impossible  .

same applies to notes , which is what it sounds like ; a utility to make random notes/ lists  .

this seems like a no    brainer  .

any app that requires typing should support landscape  .

for anyone who actually owns this device , the mbox app supports landscape mode , which makes typing much easier  .

it also handles a lot of types of e    mail attachments , which the default e    mail app does not  .

it only works with hotmail , however  .

looks like i'll be using my hotmail account a lot more the rest of my gripes probably have more to do with the apple philosophy than with this device in particular  .

they seem to operate on a principle of have a slick user interface , but don't let the end    user tweak anything  .

you cannot even turn it on without connecting to itunes  .

give me a break  .

not only that , but apple wo not let it function when you connect to itunes if qttask  .

exe is not running in the background (part of quicktime that insists on loading at startup  .

i turned it off because it was not doing anything for me except using resources)  .

what's that have to do with turning on an mp3 player  .

no stereo bluetooth  .

no microsd slot  .

why cannot i just plug in the usb cable , then drag and drop files into the appropriate folder , and have them recognized by the device  .

or save them to a microsd card and then plug it in  .

i can do this with my cell phone , my gps , actually any other portable device with flash memory i can think of is recognized as an external drive when it's plugged in to my laptop .

this is the first ipod i've had since the original 1gb ipod nano , and i have to say , it is a good piece of equipment  .

upon learning more about how to use this product it has become very useful in not only playing music , but also keeping track of my schedule  .

the calender and note pad are very convenient and easy to use  .

i've been using the calendar for reminders of all the events i have going on , and the note pad has been a good tool for when i find myself without a pen and paper  .

i do find the sound quality to struggle , as most people do  .

occasionaly i have to turn a song or two up or down  .

all in all , i'd say this product has many good features , and can be used for much more than just music downloading .

i have seen lots of mp3 players , each one with at least one gimmick feature , such as an expandable memory card slot , bluetooth connectivity or an integrated digital camera  .

everyone wants a device that will make them feel successful , and you cannot get more successful than an ipod touch  .

sleek and sexy , all glass and steel , the touch truly is the rolls royce of mp3 players  .

it's interface is incredible and it's glass multi    touchscreen is super responsive , i like that spinning wheel effect that occurs when you scroll through a long list , the ability to pinch zoom and it's tilt sensor , it's wi    fi performance is pretty good too , it took no more than 10 seconds to load a page with the safari browser at optimum conditions , it's video player works really well too , videos played smoothly with no skips or lags , even with youtube videos  .

music sounded pretty good as well , i think the music sounds better when no sound enhancement options are used because you can hear the music more naturally when no eq's or 3d effects are used  .

i liked the other applications that came with the device as well , like the pim apps , and google maps and the mail application , i like the ability to add custom features such as net apps , graphing calculators (a nifty little tool for college kids) and games , but in canada , if you do not have a credit card (apple only takes those gotta have a letter from god credit cards and not prepaid credit cards) you're only limited to the free applications , luckily there are some free apps , such as the graphing calculator and sol free , which are somewhat useful , while others are pretty much useless unless you buy the full version  .

i also was not fussy on it's fragile feel and snobby design , it's a cool device but i find it needs to be handled with care , to correct this i purchased the griffin flexgrip silicone protector , which i recommend to other ipod touch users , it makes the ipod more resilient to wear and tear , now i can pretty much take my ipod wherever i go , even on hikes or other intensive activities  .

but all in all , if you have couple of hundred dollars lying around i highly recommend this product , but if you buy it , and plan on breakdancing with it in your pocket , please buy a protector for it .

i bought this one two months ago and i'm satisfied a lot for the price i bought it  .

its touchscreen , safari browser are really excellent  .

cool graphics make it look more better than any other mp3 player  .

its more a pocket pc than a mp3 player with its mail , web browsing , maps , youtube , stocks , weather applications  .

app store really makes your ipod complete with so many exciting applications in which some are even free  .

video viewing is really a better experience on this ipod on a big 3  .

5 lcd screen with an amazing resolution of 480x320 pixels  .

this is really sleek and more sexy  .

its definitely a must    have gadget , but its bad sound quality and cheap earphones are a drawback  .

it has got 20 eq presets , but none would show difference when you hear the songs in those earphones provided  .

the shiny back of ipod touch is easily prone to fingerprints and scratches so its better to have a case when you carry it around  .

and lastly , the use of itunes this made me so frustrated that it wouls erase all the songs and data when connected to a different computer  .

anyway , the genius feature provided by it is cool  .

totally its great but not perfect .

updated  .

on nov 18 , 2008  .

i love the ipod touch  .

huge screen is perfect for playing games or surfing the web  .

i dunno about other cities but now with hot zones all over toronto , you can basically connect to the internet from anywhere  .

especially perfect for me since i'm a university student and one of my profs dislike laptops because he finds them distracting  .

no problem , take out my ipod touch and log on , and he cannot see it because of its thin size battery life on this is awesome  .

it will probably last me a whole week before i need to recharge it  .

it's not like i use my ipod rarely  .

i actually use it during breaks and going to and from school which amounts to about 4    4  .

5 hours a day one problem i do have with my ipod touch , and i'm not sure if anyone else has this problem , but most of the time , when i'm listening to my music , my ipod is in my pockets  .

when it's in my pockets , it switches the display from the songs album cover to the album flow option (vertical display to horizontal display)  .

sometimes , when i take out my ipod to backtrack on the song , or go to my menu to switch to a specific song , my ipod's screen stays in the horizontal display even when i'm holding it vertically  .

i just fix this by pushing to home button then tapping the music button again  .

it can get annoying at times .

this product is ahead of any other in any category  .

that is why you cannot compare it to any other mp3 player  .

but the price is still a turn off for me  .

i am currently using a zune 80gb black and i paid about $200 for it  .

i have 45gb of music alone  .

13gb more than the highest capacity ipod touch can hold which is about $400  .

still way too expensive  .

i also seriously dislike having the sync and the headphone jack placement , so damn annoying  .

other than that it is a really , really good player  .

but does not warrant a perfect 5  .

and the whole itunes thing  .

doesn't work for me and not enough video support  .

, a huge screen and can only play 3 types of video files  .

why doesn't anyone support avi files  .

besides archos and cowon of course  .

jobs , can you call me when you have an ipod touch that can hold 60+ gb costs less than $300 and does not scratch  .

but until then .

my creative zen died after 2 1/2 years under the extended warranty  .

since this model is no longer available at best buy , i had $280 to use  .

i is going to buy the zune which has huge storage , but the itouch caught my eye  .

i tooled around with it and bought it  .

i never had over 15gb on the zen and the 16gb itouch is fine  .

the touch screen is suberb , pretty easy to navigate and all in all i am really impressed  .

i used slysoft's dvd mobile to convert some movies and they play very well  .

the internet is cool , and i really like it the reason why i chose the zen over the ipod a few years ago is because i like the fact that you did not have to sync the device , but rather i could drag my files over to the player  .

it seems that with the itouch you have to sync with itunes which is easy , but seems limited with what you can do  .

i have not tried to add anything with our 2nd computer , but i expect some issues  .

for most folks this will probably be a non issue , but bugs me  .

i bought some 3rd poarty av cables to hook into my stereo and tv  .

i get the audio but not the video  .

after some research , i found out that apple incorporates some type of chip which is needed for the video , i  .

you have to buy the apple cables for four times the price  .

i miss the fm radio player , but i guess i can buy another add on .

the second    generation ipod touch includes features that are light    years ahead of the competition , its design has improved , and its price has finally come down to earth  .

great lttle machine .

i've been using my ipod touch for a year and it's awesome  .

the user interface is smooth and it does not lag  .

the sound quality is pretty good  .

i just love it  .

the only serious problem i found is with the itunes membership  .

i cannot even open an account from bangladesh  .

i cannot find bangladesh in their list  .

so i cannot download apps or update the firmware apple should resolve these problems as soon as possible .

more like a mini    pc than an mp3 player , the ipod touch is definitely worth it (unless all you seek a simple , basic music player)  .

you'll find yourself using it every day for everything from its intended purpose to social networking via apps to killing time with a game of solitaire  .

the touch screen is simply amazing , the wide variety of applications makes it incredibly customizable , and the entire device is just amazing the wi    fi connection is among the best features of the ipod  .

it enables you to download music and apps on    the    go , without a computer , which is a major plus  .

safari works incredibly well , and is a much better browser than the mobile versions found on , say , the blackberry  .

however , flash is a much needed addition , some fonts don't work (that's just me being nitpicky) , and the size can be a bit small  .

(holding the ipod landscape helps a little with the size issue , though  .

) using wi    fi , safari , and other apps in general is also makes the battery run out faster i've had some problems with the screen freezing up , but it does not last for over a minute and occurs very rarely  .

the screen itself gets oily easily , which is a bit of a drawback       but nothing a bit of cleaning cannot fix       and the back attracts an insane amount of fingerprints and scratches , so it's a good idea to get a case for the ipod also i've heard some static in my music       i'm not sure if it's the earphones , the songs (it tends to only pop up in certain songs) , or the device itself  .

and it's only noticeable when i listen in the dead silence of 4 am       so it's not a huge issue in a perfect world , the ipod touch would also have a microphone , possibly a camera , and a better quality speaker  .

but the world is not perfect , and the ipod is still a great device that's worth buying ( random side note   i love the clacking sounds the touch    screen keyboard makes  .

xd)  .

the second generation ipod touch offers one of the best values as mp3 players/handhelds go  .

the build quality is simply fantastic ; high quality materials as always  .

still the back is extremely scratch prone  .

i made the battery test just to know if apple is lying once more and i is surprised to see that it actually got a lot more than 40 hours from a single charge (mid volume with some cheap sony mdr buds)  .

the screen's responsiveness is heavenly but still having the dedicated volume keys , which is a no    brainer the first time , are a nice touch the apps you can get from the app store range from awesome to completely useless ; from free to utterly expensive  .

still this is the reason i got the touch in the first place  .

i use it more like a pda than a mp3 player , and these are the reasons   i hate itunes  .

it is slow , consumes resources at ridiculous levels and it doesn't show up , even in eye    candy form  .

the navigation is not intuitive when syncing is involved and has problems updating my library (i prefer the zune software (  .

the main reason i don't use it for playing music that much is because the sound quality is blah  .

even the eq    less zune makes my files sound fuller and warmer than the touch , it cannot drive full    sized or supra    aural headphones with a mere 32 ohms impedance without rising the volume to at least ~80% , give me a break , even my cheap se w380 phone sounds better than this  .

all this relegates the touch to a device for casual listening  .

don't get me wrong , it is not too bad , but for the price i'd expect a better sound chip , even in exchange of battery life another thing that bothers me is the limiting of the capabilities of the device  .

it's not unknown that apple loves closing everything in it's little bubble but come on , charging costumers for a function which is there from day one is simply ridiculous  .

and for some reason i believe it wo not even offer full a2dp functionality ; that's not like apple (you know , the iphone's bt profiles for example)  .

still if you're a casual listener looking for a nice device that will let you browse the web (the most computer    like experience on a handheld yet) , manage your schedule or anything else that comes to mind this is the device updated  .

on sep 10 , 2009  .

good device but justifiably fragile .

overall a great device well worth the money just apple needs to fix the few kinks  .

and lower the price the iphone is 199$ has camera and a phone for less money .

it worth your attention .

got this from my family for fathers day  .

i liked the concept but it still lacks some badly needed features  .

one of which is flash player for safari  .

battery life is under 3 hours with wifi  .

apple brags about all the third party applications but many do not get many stars for quality from users  .

i downloaded several popular paid and free apps and can general agree that not all are that great or useful  .

i like this product but it is handicapped and needs more features to be more useful .

a very good multimedia device flawed by mediocre sound quality .

it is really a pain in the neck to use itune to transfer arrange music/video/photo files  .

your music/video/photo files originally stored in the itouch can suddenly lost disappear when you try to add files .

is almost the same than the first generation  .

i have both and there's no big changes  .

i purchased to replace my failing palm tungsten e , so i is primarily interested in its pim features  .

it should be better than my palm syncing to my imac but it implements only a subset of the imacs functionality  .

but pdas are a dead market segment with everyone but me going to smart cell phones  .

i gotta take what i can get  .

it looks slick       i have played a couple videos on it , but i've yet to use it as a music player  .

updated  .

on oct 1 , 2008  .

a very nice product overall but is missing the key aspects of a true mp3 player such as sound quality  .

but i love mine and is very usefull in certain cases .

thank gawd i bought an extended warrenty this shouldnt happen in a second gen , ever i wish there is a dedicated on/off button like the rest of the market but what do they know .

why is cnet putting this as it's top mp3 player if the sound quality is not great  .

is not sound quality the most important feature of a music player  .

i'm ticked that i bought into all the hype over ipod only to find out after buying one that it does not sound that good  .

what a waste of money i've tried several different earphones , costing hundreds of dollars and also tried other conversion softwares to convert my cds all to no avail  .

after messing around so much that is when i decided to do more research and found out that the sound is a common complaint normally i would have done more research ahead of time , but as i said , i bought into the hype .

do not buy this unless apple solves the wi    fi problems including    .

wap issues 2  .

problems at distances over 20' from router  .

what a shame that you still cannot navigate through a website that has flash content    (  .

this product is great for its mny features but its kind of weird how apple changes the prizes then goes back to its original prize it also seems to be gettign slower and starting to freeze more  .

false advertising   apple claims 36 hour batter life  .

for me , the battery lasted only 2    4 hours (no video being used and turned brightness down till i could barely see it)  .

during first week of purchase   constantly freezing  .

malfunctions every time you use it  .

certain applications will open and then shut off in a few seconds  .

i will be returning this goofy device asap  .

a camera would have been a nice addition for the price , but then again , it probably would not have worked anyway  .

i will be doing some more research to find a more stable mp3 player .

1) expensive 2) sound quality is just average 3) form over function   handling it as handling a thin bar of wet soap  .

a big design flaw 4) wi    fi is not working as advertised  .

it can only connect ot an opened network  .

try to save time and headache if you want to connect it to your own secured network 5) everything has to go through itunes  .

6) another design flaw   volume control on touch pad beside two hard mechanical buttons on the side  .

you could accidentally hit the max volume and your ears will be ringing afterward  .

take cnet reviews as a grain of salt  .

they now even review cars  .

i also rec'd this thing for father's day , as a gift from my wife  .

what is she thinking  .

at 11 times what i spent on her for mother's day i is dumb    founded  .

as someone who never , ever wears headphones or uses his current mp3 player i is even more confused  .

even when i did use my creative muvo on my commute to work (when i had a job) i usually only listened to the radio , and i get sick watching video in a vehicle anyway  .

i mean my wife has a 1st gen touch and i have rarely picked it up or shown interest in it  .

so far i've had this device for a little over 3 weeks , i have lost hours of sleep deciding whether or not to return it i am running out of time as i only have 3 more days what to do  .

i would have rather had a pneumatic nailer or something oh and the worst feature the easy unchecked internet access  .

yep i'm a recovering sex    addict , or at least i is until the touch came along  .

i had been 'sober' (after joining saa) for almost four months , i hadn't looked at a single p0rn site on my computer or anywhere else , i had really cleaned up my act and stopped wasting so much of my precious time  .

then the touch came along , sitting neatly on the bedside table , and hey guess what there's all kinds of p0rn sites specifically designed for these mobile devices  .

i succumbed to the temptation and months of hard work is thrown away in an instant  .

i is mad at myself , mad at my wife and suddenly 100% opposed to the idea of my son getting one of these for his 13th birthday  .

i haven't been to a meeting since i am ashamed to have to admit to all those other men that i have failed and am again starting from zero i f__king hate the touch , part of me wants to throw it on the floor and jump on it  .

but we're broke (another reason i didn't understand why on earth my wife would buy this for me) and the $280cdn she spent on it is needed  .

3 more days , i guess i should plug it in and hit restore , polish the small scratches off the back and put it back in its poorly designed box that doesn't even stay closed  .

i am so happy that i didn't unwrap the headphones , cable or cleaning cloth , should make returning it much easier did i mention that i have not listened to a single complete song on this thing  .

people need to wake up and realise how much of their lives they are wasting on useless bits of technology like the touch  .

get outside , enjoy some fresh air , listen to what's going on around you instead of being constantly plugged in and unaware  .

the money would be better spent on a bike , get out and ride  .

no wonder there's so much obesity well i'm done now , i'm not sure if i feel better or just more angry about the whole thing have a nice day , geeks  .

on jul 16 , 2009  .

nonsense apps that did not do anything  .

the sound is crappy for me and the earphones is super crappy they should improve that i only use it for music but this is not a good music player  .

and you have to a buy a adaptor to use your bluetooth headphone  .

the back is very delicate you have to buy cases just to protect it for me the apple is kinda ripping me off  .

i live in new york and have owned several cell phones , pdas and mp3 players and have never had the condensation problem with any of them that so many have complained about with their ipods (despite having left my devices in my car while shopping and then bringing them in from the cold)  .

i am not saying that condensation did not occur , just that it did not cause these devices to fail  .

my question is , why is the ipod touch and iphone so fragile and what can apple do to solve the problem in future generations of the products ps  .

i is about to buy an ipod touch until i read the high number of reviews that complained about the condensation problem  .

enter ipod or iphone condensation damage in google or youtube to see what i mean .

over the years , i have tried , used , and owned many media players from many manufacturers  .

from sony , philips , i    river , cowon , creative , sandisk , apple , archos , samsung , plus other unfamiliar brands which i cannot recall  .

even though , i    pods still gets all the glory , they are not the best media players , and not even close to my standard  .

i know i know you might say that i am crazy , or even stupid , but let it be because i know that the most important factors of any media player should be    .

1    sound quality 2    sound quality 3    sound quality 4    screen quality video playback quality 5    battery life 6    ease of use (gui) 7    versatility of coping media  .

8    then anything else  .

so , where that put the i    pods  .

very far in my opinion  .

sure you may say the i    pods are not bad in that factors , and you may consider them as average if you are fair , but i do not  .

why  .

because for the same price of any model of i    pod , you can get a much better quality mp3 media player if you consider the above most important factors for any pmp however , if you don  .

t care much about that factors , like to play games , loyal to apple brand , and have money to spend , then i    pods might fit you well , and that  .

s defiantly not me or any one serious audiophile about a real pmp's qualities i have many friends how are apple    addicted , and they own i    pods  .

i noticed that they use their i    pods mostly to play games  .

in fact some of them did not load any music on theirs  .

they are utilizing their pmps to pay games or to surf the net  .

and when i ask the few of them who use theirs to play music   why you don  .

t buy walkman instead  .

they always answer    .

are you nut i    pods are the best quality mp3 players and nothing else comes close  .

and whenever i do a window shopping of pmps , i always like to ask the salesmen about the best sounding media players  .

and the defaults answer is i    pods  .

some salesmen even insist that i    pods offer the best sound quality than those from sony or any other brand  .

wow what a hype apple have on their products  .

i am not an apple lover or hater , because i do respect the tastes others who love it  .

i am just against the huge hype surrounding their products  .

i also hate those comparison reviewers who always  .

unfairly  .

pick i    pods over the better ones just according to their own personal preferences , thus creating this hype , thus misleading us updated  .

on aug 21 , 2009  .

i really love the features available on this product which makes it all the more disappointing that i am now in the process of acquiring my 3rd one in just over a month because the first two quit functioning (1st screen froze and 2nd the audio is never consistent and eventually stopped)  .

at the apple store i visited here in dallas a tech support person is emphasizing that you should never allow your itouch (iphone) near water water is the enemy  .

i interrupted , (she is talking to another customer) , and asked what about if you use it to run  .

she said , never run with the itouch this is a computer  .

you would not run with a computer would you  .

i is bit shocked as one of the reasons i bought the itouch is to use it with the nike sensor and the app that tracks your time and milage when you run  .

i mentioned this you so why does it support the nike app  .

and she just waved it off  .

another tech support person , who overheard what is said , whispered to me you can run with it  .

idk , maybe that's the problem  .

if i had to do it over again i'd just buy an ipod .

apple makes good devices but they are really milking me on the low quality accessories  .

my $250 touch is worthless because of a poorly designed usb charger (intentional perhaps  .

it just makes me mad .

my $20 mp3 player works faster and easier than this monstrosity  .

so what if it does not have the cool' touch screen .

i may not be a true audiophile , but from where i stand the touch sounds awful  .

is it so much to ask to have everything you want in life in one nice little package  .

sold a used product as new  .

what more can i say , examine the packaging carefully before you leave the store .

i am shopping for a device that better suits my needs  .

if you are a vanilla user and do not object to apple's idiotic software system , this is a great device  .

otherwise , steer clear .

i admit that i can be wrong because we all know that there are further enhancements coming this end of summer but for now , this update is a complete disappointment to myself  .

i currently use my laptop and nokia n810 to dial the internet through my 3g phone so that i can browse , check my emails , etc  .

i is really hoping that i could do this through my ipod touch but about all i can do is pair with these units and that is it .

i do not want to buy this mp3 player unless i know for certain that you can use mediamonkey with it  .

i'm not going to allow myself to have anything to do with itunes (even if my younger brother owns an ipod mini , and most recently , an ipod    u2 with video capability)  .
