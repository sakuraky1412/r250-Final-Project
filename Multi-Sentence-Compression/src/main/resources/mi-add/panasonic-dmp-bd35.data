quality seems on par with every other panasonic product i have bought in the last nearly 20 years (all of which i still own and use)  .
player is connected to my pioneer elite dolby 7  .
1 receiver and switched to my panasonic 50 g10 plasma  .
picture quality is very impressive using 24p playback and the thx video setting on my tv without playing with and additional settings  .
very full range sound from the speakers , plus the surround sound placement is perfect  .
cannot ask for much more than this out of a player , i would not mind upgrading to a newer player for the faster load time , but no real reason to layout money for one minor upgrade .
i am using this player with my panny pz800 for a month  .
i resulted excellent image quality  .
i have made an side by side comparement with ps3  .
the picture of ps3 is meaningless and  .
the only good thing about it becoming sharp  .
but the picture on this player is dramatic , deep and its like 3d  .
also sharp  .
also this player is very slim  .
great design  .
looks good in my tv unit .
yeah best buy of the year right on bluray  .
this is my first high definition dvd player  .
it worked out of the box with an all hdmi setup  .
the sound is clear with crisp highs and deep bass  .
the minimalist design of the dmp    bd35 fits perfectly with today's remote    based operation  .
there is an on/off button and an open/close button ; all other controls are supported via the remote  .
on    screen menus are easy to read and visually navigate  .
it supports the all the digital outputs and processing necessary to function with today's moderate to high    end home theater components updated  .
on feb 24 , 2009  .
the product from the box to hook up is easy to use  .
the menus are in good order and clearly identify what you are about to do when activating a feature  .
the book that came with it explains things in great detail and has a nice troubleshooting section .
you can get this unit at costco for around $269 with an hdmi cable included    a no brainer  .
best profile 2  .
0 available today .
is able to get connection immediately as dmp    bd35 immediately recognized my wireless connection as a normal ethernet hookup  .
this despite my router being encrypted  .
the various components , all of which had very well written instruction booklets (someone who wrote these obviously not only reads and writes fluent english but also understands how to convey how to explain the intracacies of hooking things up and the problems one may have  .
) these components definitely play well together  .
all of the comments by other writers re the superb sound and visuals are absolutely true  .
highly recommended  .
why wait for the unit to drop another $25 or $50  .
this is thee best stand alone blu ray player on the market today  .
i is able to get it at sears for $138 + tax on 11/23/08  .
i bought three v1  .
3 hdmi cables for $8 each at monoprice  .
com this player is very sleek looking  .
it is connected via hdmi to my 34 widescreen crt panasonic tv  .
even at this screen size , i am able to notice significant improvement in picture quality over a standard progressive scan dvd player i cannot comment on the hd sound quality because i am getting standard 5  .
1 dolby digital through my optical digital cable to my non    hdmi receiver i am disappointed that this player cannot remember multiple disc positions like my previous dvd player which had a independent position memory button to remember upto 5 disc positions  .
this player remember only one disc (standard or blu ray) only if you press stop once  .
if the tray is opened , the memory is erased the player is pretty fast  .
it takes less than 5 seconds for the fbi warning to appear on the screen once the tray is closed this player is the best  .
once i upgrade my tv and receiver , i shall update this review .
the features and connectivity support should just about fit anyones setup  .
i use the optical bit stream audio out to my receiver for use with my 5  .
1 setup (though my yamaha has speakers a / b that allow me an extra set of front speakers) , as well as the dvds l / r stereo outputs to go directly to the back of my sony television  .
in this manner i can use the sony tv stero and built in subwoofer in addition to my 5  .
1 setup  .
my sony tv support upto 1080i on component video inputs and lacks hdmi as it is a 40 inch crt instead of lcd or plasma and also came out pre hdmi interfaces  .
setting the dvd options in the setup menu to match the dvd being viewed to the optimum of the television is an extra step but well worth the couple of button clicks to have the image quality matched (non blu ray dvd output is 480p , setting the television setting to 1080i actually is less appealing with the mismatch) i found the setup easy to understand , and other then the video output options setting to match the dvd disk type to my video system it worked out of the box image quality on non blu    ray disks is just fantastic .
researching blu    ray has been an obsession of mine and review after review is substandard  .
reading this review i knew i had found a solid buy , but i had no idea how terrific this player would be  .
standard dvd image quality is above and beyond anything i could have expected , functionality is terrific and blu    ray image quality is as advertised  .
i could not be happier with this purchase .
i take my home theater hobby pretty seriously , that's why when it came time to invest in a blu    ray player (finally the wait is over  .
) , i did a ridiculously great amount of research  .
i is willing to spend much more money on a blu    ray player , but the prices have come down so much , you don't have to  .
i narrowed down my extensive search for the right player to the panasonic dmp    bd35k and the sony bdp    s350  .
i bought them both and did a side    by    side test  .
i have some nice equipment , so i feel that the test is an excellent representation of the capabilities of these two players  .
my equipment includes a 100    inch stewart screen with a 1080p sony pearl front projector , an integra 9  .
8 dtc processor (with all the latest surround sound goodies) , an nad amp , 7 paradigm signature speakers , and a dual m k subwoofer (for full 7  .
1 surround sound) i do understand electronics , but the sony manual is really hard to follow  .
after only one call to sony , i eventually got the player set up properly  .
after i set up the panasonic , everything became much clearer  .
the panasonic manual is so much better  .
but , who really cares about manuals  .
how do these two players perform side by side  .
audio for both blu    ray discs and standard dvds   the panasonic unquestionably has better audio  .
compared to the sony , the highs were much clearer  .
the 7  .
1 surround sound put me right in the middle of the explosion (my first test blu    ray disc is national treasure i) when the charlotte blew up  .
the biggest audio difference is the bass  .
the bass in the panasonic is so much better than the sony  .
in fact , my old sony standard    dvd player had better audio than the sony bdp    s350  .
i'd give the sony 3 stars with the audio  .
the panasonic had outstanding treble , bass , and surround   5    star audio  .
video for both blu    ray discs and standard dvds   the sony's video is ok , but the panasonic's video is fantastic  .
the skin tones were more realistic and the colors were more vibrant with the panasonic  .
the sony seemed to have a thin gray film over everything       like looking through a filmy    dirty window  .
the sony had 4    star video , the panasonic and its upscaling gets an easy 5 stars  .
both my wife and i did the side    by    side test by going back and forth between blu    ray discs and standard dvds  .
we didn't discuss any of our thoughts until we each independently formed our own conclusions  .
after seeing and hearing both players , we were both in complete agreement that in every way the panasonic dmp    bd35k is superior to the sony bdp    s350 by the way , the card slot on the sony for bd    live is very hard to get to  .
i do like sony as a brand for some things , but not blu    ray players for those of you who are doing your research , hopefully i can save you some time to answer if you should buy the panasonic dmp    bd35k or dmp    bd55k  .
i called panasonic and asked the differences ; besides the price , there are only two differences  .
the 55k plays divx's  .
if you don't have any divx's like me and most of the people on planet earth , this doesn't make any difference to you  .
the only other difference is that the 35k can only output dolby true hd and dts hd master audio to a receiver/processor that has an hdmi input  .
if your receiver doesn't have an hdmi input , you wo not be able to get them out of the 35k  .
if your receiver does have an hdmi input and you'll be using an hdmi cable , then you have absolutely no need to buy the 55k  .
with the 55k , if you have an older receiver that does not have an hdmi input , you can use the 55k's analog audio outputs so that you can have dolby true hd and dts hd master audio  .
that's a nice feature of the 55k if you have an older receiver but want the latest surround sound formats also , to save you some research time , i've already checked out all of the professional reviews including the ones on cnet  .
com   the sony is considered ok , and cnet liked the panasonic so much that it is the first blu    ray player ever to receive cnet's editor's choice award  .
i have to go to the store now and return the sony player that i bought  .
i'm keeping the panasonic  .
hopefully you found this review helpful  .
this player is in the price range where almost everyone can afford one to replace their dvd player  .
this player has a great pictures along with wonderful sound  .
panasonic makes great products and they dont miss here .
panasonic is a solid brand , however the players need to hit 199 and movies 15    20 for me to jump  .
also , if you dont already know pioneer is working on 500gb media there's hvd    which is very cool so i'm not sure if blu    ray will catch on in the same fashion as dvd did or will it be another superior format .
i bought this in november '08 from amazon when the price fell below $250  .
it may not be worth the nearly $600 it's selling for now .
hooked up to a 1080i screen it produces an image slightly clearer than cable hd programing without any moments of blur or jaggedness  .
sound and picture quality vastly superior to that of dvd  .
set up menu easy to use  .
lots of cool picture and sound controls that can be changed while viewing  .
worth the wait for prices to come down from $4oo+  .
deserving of the editors' choice award .
if you are not going to shell out the cash on a ps3 , then this is the way to go  .
after you plug the player in to the receiver and turn the power on , the set    up menu pops up  .
there is an easy set up mode , which just like the title implies , is easy to understand and use  .
once that is done , you are ready to use the player  .
the only thing this player lacks that i wish it had is a wireless connection  .
since most poeple do not have an internet connection where their home theatre is located , it would be worth a few more $ to make that happen if wireless connection is not a big deal for you , then go with this player  .
updated  .
on dec 28 , 2008  .
after initial set    up the first disc into the unit is fifth element    a heavy special effect action flick from 1998  .
used the dvd and bluray discs to compare  .
the quality of the 1998 film is at least twice the quality  .
images were sharp and detailed including the background    where all detail is visible  .
the remote has a nice solid feel and the quality of the unit itself solid  .
no clunky noices i had previously read about with the unit  .
only the door not meshing up right is the biggest drawback to the unis exterior appearance    similar to the sony look  .
i would highly recomment this unit to anyone  .
someone mentioned getting the sony playstation for just $100 more  .
i paid $250 for this one so that saves me $150 versus the ps3  .
that's quite a few blu ray discs and today with the economy the way it is ever penny counts .
the set up is nonexistent because we had a panasonic tv  .
great player , very easy to use .
i waited a year for a inexpensive , high quality , stand alone blu    ray player  .
i'm glad i waited for this one  .
i'm very happy with it  .
cnet reviewers should make clear whether blu    ray players will display dvd+r material  .
samsung players will not as of november 22 , 2008 .
i had been holding out on getting a blu    ray because i knew the price would eventually fall dramatically  .
i wanted a good value but did not want to give up quality  .
i is able to get this unit for $241 on 6th ave electronics with free shipping (go to bountii for the coupon code)  .
considering the fantastic array of audio decoding modes and profile 2  .
0 compliance , plus objectively fantastic picture quality , this player is a no    brainer  .
the picture (even on my older 720p native resolution dlp) is much better than with my upconverting dvd  .
amazingly , the sound seemed to be clearer and better imaged with my 5  .
1 surround setup even though i is running the player through my old receiver with just a stereo connection (  .
the only downside (     .
5 star) is that it is slower than hell when loading discs and going from playback to the disc menu .
other than the load time , i have say that i'm very pleased with this bd player and would recommend it to anyone for the price i paid  .
now since the bd 35 has now been discontinued and replaced by the dmp    bd60  .
all i can hope for is that panasonic keeps the quality good and the price as reasonable for others , as it is for me .
purchased this new at the same time as one of the higher end model onkyo a/v receivers  .
being a bit of an audio enthusiast , i wanted to make sure that everything is working perfect and i is getting the best sound out  .
quickly found out that panasonic has a long history of compatibility issues with onkyo and that i would not be able to get anything better than 5  .
1 sound nor any hd signals through bitstream format  .
sound is still fantastic , but you do not invest in great equipment with the latest technology to only be able to use features that i had on my 15 year old stereo that i just got rid of .
this is a great improvement over the bd30 , but bd    live is not  yet  all it's cracked up to be  .
that's not the bd35's fault , it's the content providers'  .
but more processing power might make navigating bd    live content a bit quicker  .
every title i've experimented with has been slow to load bd    live content as if i'm back on dial    up again  .
however , since i'm not that interested in bd    live in the first place , it's really a non    issue for me , and again , may not be the player's fault anyway a note during setup   find a thx optimizer on a thx certified dvd or blu    ray , or use digital video essentials or hd basics and setup your brightness  on the player   .
you may find that you need to up the player's brightness setting to +8 or more before the pluge setting is correct  .
however , this will also vary depending on the display .
costco is selling this unit for 200 bucks with an hdmi cable  .
definitely worth it at this price point .
good product for the price .
i like this player mostly because it incorporates the latest in blu    ray technology and audio output to date  .
it is a snap to install  .
with the hdmi output/input it is replaced in my system in less than 10 minutes  .
so far very very few complaints  .
cnet's review on this product is right on .
awsome with blu    ray and a good machine overall but the ps3 is just a $100 more not only does the ps3 have better functionality then the panasonic player but it also supports other media like games and web browsing  .
what can i say that has not already been said , this little unit is a great value and up until it stopped working is an ideal dvd player as well  .
i'll submit another follow review when i get the unit back  .
meanwhile i purchased a bd    605 from costco until the old unit is returned , then i will return the 605 .
before using this , or any other , player it would be advisable to update firmware as some of the changes do affect playback and operation  .
as of december 1 , 2008 the current firmware is version 1  .
5 found this at big box store with a short hdmi cable included for $229 before black friday which is a good price for blu    ray although still slightly overpriced as a high definition dvd player  .
i will not repeat what others have already said concerning the vast improvement in high definition video over standard definition but this is what i have found    .
the profile 2  .
0 standard permits manufacturers to provide insufficient onboard memory to support bd    live and popup functions but fails to specify minimum and maximum requirements for movies making it impossible for users to determine if they need to purchase a class 2 , 4 or 6 sdhc card and of what capacity  .
incorporation of bd    live content in movies is inconsistent and to date seems to be more prevalent in horror and more violent type flicks  .
a user will probably have to frequently erase old files to free memory on the sdhc card pressed the fast forward button during playback and learned that the first setting is more of a rapid play with audio also being speeded along tested the upconversion of some standard dvd and found that standard definition dvd produced more than a few years ago suffer some artifacts whereas newer do not appear to  .
specific examples were some vertical blues wavy lines against a blue sky background with a large number of planes flying in simulated combat when playing battle of britain and occasional choppy scene transition when going from a brightly scene immediately to another brightly lit scene in the santa claus 2 and these same movies did not have these artifacts when played in either a previous hd dvd player or standard definition player  .
i did adjust settings to verify that these artifacts were repeatedly created and not the result of my choice of settings  .
these artifacts did not seem to occur when playing newer or more recently produced standard definition dvd  .
otherwise upconversion seemed to be adequate and close to what my hdtv already provides disc formats that cannot be played include dvd    rom , sacd , photo cd , dvd    audio , svcd and wma discs so it might be better to use blu    ray (or at least this player) as the primary playback device and keep an existing dvd or hd dvd player to continue to play other media formats that you may own each manufacturer has to decide what features are to be included but these players have limited ability to resume play once the stop button is pushed    resume only occurs on standard definition dvd playback  .
bookmarks are lost when a disc is removed  .
when jumping to a scene or bookmark the lag time to resume audio is a bit excessive , not enough to be a problem but close  .
according to the operating instructions there is a screen saver after periods of inactivity but it appears that this is disabled in firmware updates but i do not yet have a response from panasonic to determine if this is intentional or is to be corrected  .
however , the screen saver would be inoperable with most blu    ray discs as they load java and , again , i do not know why this is since i previously owned a toshiba hd dvd player (a30) i is not overwhelmed by the high definition playback but is underwhelmed by blu    ray  .
s extremely slow development of standard player features which has resulted in continued inflation of media prices since licensing fees are so high and production lines had to be replaced whereas hd dvd would have required only modification of production equipment as hd dvd is more of dvd on steroids  .
overall , the two new panasonic players finally bring blu    ray up to the features that were standard in hd dvd two years ago  .
admittedly i am not happy with the fact that the decision between the basically equal formats is not allowed to be resolved by consumer choice updated  .
on dec 13 , 2008  .
after reading cnet reviews i went with the panasonic th    50pz800u and bd    35 combination  .
i have watched 3 blu ray movies and to be honest , i did not see any difference between these and standard dvds  .
i do not not know if i am doing something wrong , but connecting an hdmi cable from the player to the tv is goof proof  .
my readout indicates bd 24p at 1080p and my picure is set to thx  .
i have installed the latest firmware update  .
do not know what else to look at , but as of now i am disappointed and wish i had just kept my old standard dvd player .
i got this yesterday and after unboxing it and putting a dvd in it i is inches away from just packing it back up and returning it to best buy  .
not sure if it's the hdmi cable or what it is , but i had problems with both ironman and mib  .
compared it to my xbox 360's picture (for mib) and the xbox looked better  .
i'm going to keep it because it seems like i'd have worse luck with any other bluray players in the price range and this is my best choice  .
just bothered .
does not play iron man , inglorious basterds (tried two different discs) , in bruges , and 9 (the last 2 i received together from netflix and could not watch either) so frustrating  .
choose another one  .
normally i trust cnet reviews , but they blew it this time  .
it does not appear they did any testing of avchd content on this player  .
if they had , i think it would have gotten the much lower ratingi it should have gotten  .
i feel like i is duped by both panasonic and cnet .
aside from the terrible loading time slowness and waiting just to get a movie up and running , this product just does not work properly most of the time  .
it goes in to freezing modes where it makes longer and longer pauses in the video stream until it dies , and an operation throws you back to the main menu  .
this behavior is random , and may or may not be fixed by cycling the power or ejecting the disc there is little rhyme or reason  .
the problems can affect any disc and then go away if you are lucky  .
if not , you just cannot watch that movie  .
sorry , too bad these problems got increasingly worse after about a 9 months to year of owning the product panasonic offers little help  .
aside from doing firmware updates , all i got is that in order to fix this device i would need to ship it to some address with a description of what is wrong instead of wasting my time on that , i will just never buy another panasonic product again , ever  .
defects this bad should be fixed for free and a replacement shipped out with a rma for shipping the defective product back free clearly panasonic does not care one whit about customer satisfaction , and i encourage anyone who reads this to seriously consider avoiding their products .
i purchased this player after the glowing cnet editor and user uploaded reviews on this site  .
to it's credit the player lived up to it's promise when it is new  .
this is unfortunately short    lived however , because now i get hdmi error messages every time i try to play a blu    ray or dvd and it won't output video or audio signals unless i wait for about 20 minutes  .
nothing has changed in my setup that might account for this phenomenon , and all the other hdmi devices i own perform fine when connected in an identical fashion through my onkyo receiver  .
my hunch is that somewhere along the line , one of the player's firmware updates screwed something up in it's basic ability to operate through my receiver  .
i have yet to test it to see if it does the same thing when connected directly to my tv set , but even if it does not that's completely unacceptable since i consider it an essential part of my home theater experience  .
panasonic tech support has been no help  .
too bad , i used to like panasonic a lot  .
i'll really think twice before buying another product from them updated  .
on sep 14 , 2010  .
setup is very easy    menus are simple and straight forward  .
picture quality in 1080i is good but the player will not provide proper 1080p output  .
output is grainy and poor quality and i would not recommend this player .
1080p Full HD video via HDMI output, newer digital audio formats; high cost for players &#38; movies
Fast loading times. Decent upconverting of non-HD material.; Stopped outputting signals properly via HDMI after a period of just over one year.
Snazzy good looking. Fully loaded with all HD sound formats.; No position memory to remember positions of multiple discs.
Excellent standard DVD image quality and terrific blu-ray features. User controlled image output.; No independant speaker settings for HDMI (the BD55 has it)
Easy to set up, slim design and quiet while operating.; Starts from begining when stopped.
Great feature set considering the price, free HDMI cable, outstanding picture quality, great customer support; Compatibility issues, sluggish response from remote commands
Everything the Cnet review and reviewers have said, i.e. low cost, high picture and sound quality.; None so far.
Easy to setup, Startup time short. Good 1080I picture and upconverting to 1080i good.; Will not provide proper 1080p picture-very grainy-must revert to 1080i.
When the player works properly, it does what its supposed to do. Play blu-ray movies.; Freezing, poor navigation, incredibly slow, random inability to read the same clean discs, random copyright violation notices with no reason (have only used legitimate store bought discs).
Not sure, bluray player.; Very graney during DVD Upconverts and I had issues with the quality of Ironman (may have been the production, 300 looks great :D).
Amazing video quality good price; for $100 dollars more you can get the ps3 with an 80gd hard drive at Walmart. What else do i need to say?
Panasonic quality. Great video. Solid audio. Viera Link lets me keep it out of sight and still control it.; Not compatible with anything online, just ethernet updates.. Not the load speed of newer players.
Price, Crisp video, Great sound, Features allow for easy integration with most current home theater components, Minimalist design; Remote looks a little cheesy with all the colors and bulbous shape (but is 100% logical and functional)
OK Image. Not much else.; Takes minutes to power up. almost a minute to initialize a disk. 2/3 of my DVD's do not play. Only supports DVD-R recorded but most of mine will not play. Sony, even the cheapest do. Will not restart a DVD from the same place that you st
Great video and audio quality from commercial Blu Ray and DVD disks.; AVCHD content won't play from either DVD or from SD reader as advertised. Panasonic camcorders seem to be the only AVCHD content that will play.
Impressive HD video playback, onboard DTS-HD and TrueHD, the first level of fast forward plays understandable audio, upgradeable firmware, well designed remote, very light and relatively small footprint (I originally thought that the box was empty).; Standard def DVD upconversion may produce artifacts, requires purchase of additional external memory, limited onboard memory functions, screen saver does not work, Blu-Ray movies are ridiculously expensive and under featured.
Superb blu-ray decoding and a wide set of video settings. Speedy power-on and load times (compared to most standalones), bitstream or decode hi-res audiotracks on-board. Automatically notifies user of firmware updates if connected to internet.; Occasionally, navigating setup menu is sluggish.
Worked right out of the box and hooked into two Panasonic BL-PA100A Ethernet Adaptor plugin adaptors (both plug into wall electrical outlet, one has ethernet wire to Linksys router, other to DMP-BD35.; None that I can find, unless one needs to do a non-HDMI hookup, then get the 55.
Easy to set up and operate, updating the firmware was a snap .; The screen resize feature battles my tv for the rights size, wish there was a way to disable it.
I like the upconversion of dvds and being able to set acpect ratio. The color and sound options are what I expected as well. the new BD live will be intresting. the price was alright.; none really I will enjoy the new format now
Setup is easy, documentation is better then average. Robust features and options. Video and Audio output options are supurb, and backward compatibility with non-blu ray makes even those look HD.; Nothing actually, though the cables that come with the unit are unneccasry, they are RCA audio (L / R) and video. Does anyone purchasing this type of component really use those outputs - even though they are provided?
Fast to load movies over brands in the past. Easy setup and controls. The BD-Live works well, even though I don't really see much use for it.; BD-LIVE... who needs it?
Good picture (when it plays).; Does not play many discs.. Volume is all over the place. Often turning TV vol to max for dialogue and then needing to turn it way down during action scenes.. L O A D S... S L O W L Y...
Easy set up, fantastic picture and sound, good remote. Great price!; Slow to load discs, although apparently this is true of most Blu-Ray players.
With my TV powered OFF, pressing the "Open/close" button on the Blu-Ray player remote automatically switches on the TV and opens the DVD at its menu page. Fabulous! The upconverted video is wonderfully sharp and colorful.; Some older DVD+R slide shows made with Pinnacle software will not display, but. display OK on a 10" Panasonic portable player.
Great DVD upscaling and very good Blu-Ray performance. Purchased for $278 at Costco last year.; The BD-35 up and died on me last week after 11 months of perfect operation. I just sent it in for warranty repair today. The BD-605 is going for $129 at Costco this week, which shows you how much prices have dropped.
Easy set-up and the discs load quickly compared to the Sony I was looking at. Quality of output using HDMI was distinctive and detailed. .; Doesn't come with the HDMI cable. Includes basi cheap cable that's useless using the blu ray to it full capacity. Don't forget to purchase an HDMI cable. small door on unit does not line up very well at one end. minor issue but at $249.99 it should.
Relatively fast to load. Easy to use. Great picture and sound, stunning sometimes with great BD DVDs like "The Fall." Connects to the net. SD slot is helpful. The fact that it's under 2" high makes it fit into my shelving easily.; Remote should be backlit. I wish it connected to Netflix like the LG.
Very good DVD upconversion, Very good HD obviously. Almost complete HD audio and video codec support. Supports AVCHD playback from a Canon HF10 HD Video Camera via an SD card.; Not as many user tweaks for fine tuning the device' output. Remote ihas no backlight or GID buttons. Need the BD55 to get 7.1 analog out. Might have difficulty doing HDMI handshake with older TVs equipped with an older HDMI 1.1 interface.
I think this is the perfect player for those who don't want to purchase an PS3. Great Picture quality and the Sound Decoding is everything that you would ever need.; It is a bit taller than my older Phillips standard DVD Player
This player really plays everything . In addition to it's stellar video and sound features,it plays MP3 at random and I was able to update the firmware via the ethernet connection from my router. For the price it is truly an excellent player. !; What don't I like?? I don't have another one for my HDTV in the bedroom....yet
A BD stand alone player that lives up to the accolades that cnet gave it. And on my Sony 46" Bravia, It's a wonderful picture. The most surprising was to see that this BD player has actually appreciated in value since I purchased it in December.; Load time is still a bit slow. I don't own a ps3, so l can't compare it to that. However, I do have an HD DVD player, as an add-on to my 360 and I have to admit, my HD DVD's load a lot faster. Almost as fast as a standard DVD.
I bought this product based on the reviews from cnet.com. It was a good price and a profile 2.0 player. It has network support for easy firmware updates and additional content. It has easy to navigate menus. The player is not sluggish at all.; Plugged it in with component cables and there was a noticeable line refresh problem. Connected with HDMI cable and no problem. Might be the component cables. SDHC will not play AVI files. Remote does not glow in the dark or have any backlit buttons.
