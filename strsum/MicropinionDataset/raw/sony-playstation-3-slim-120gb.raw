Pros:. its awesome. 
Cons:. its awesome. 
Summary:. its awesome. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything! Beautiful HD graphics rendering, plays 3D blu-rays, can configure the system to any desired setting, easy and quick configuration, the extras such as online browsing content, netflix, wireless community, Auto updates, etc.. Sturdy build.. 
Cons:. It needs a better web browser but that's not really a big deal anyway. It doesn't come with an HDMI cable, which is ridiculous in this day and age.. 
Summary:. This is an exceptionally well-made system. It has plenty of hard drive capacity, easy connectivity and stream-ability with wired or wireless external devices such as the PC or usb drives, ipod, etc. The menu screen looks nice and pleasing and is easy to navigate through for personal adjustments and whatnot. I especially love the visualizations that go along with music. The charge on the controller lasts a good while. The PS3 slim is future ready with the new 3D software, which is a big bonus.... And, it is well priced.. 

$$;
Pros:. The slim design is more attractive than earlier, bulkier, version. Playstation controllers last quite a long time for being wireless. Blu-ray quality can't be beat. Game selection is superb. It's a playstation. 
Cons:. Controllers are way over priced. When I bought the DVD remote I had to update, which is annoying but has nothing to do with console. Other than that I haven't found anything that I don't like. 
Summary:. I have always been an Xbox fan. My brother was a Playstation fan. And one thing that you know about being a fanatic is that you will never be open minded enough to say "you're right, it is better". But that was the case with this. I told myself that I would never buy the Playstation 3, and I did. I love it. It's fast, games are amazing, blu-ray capability is outstanding. I love it. I can't wait to see what Sony does next!. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-ray, Blue tooth, built in WiFi, browser, PSN store, and all around media hub.. 
Cons:. not backwards compatible, HDMI cable not included. 
Summary:. who doesn't love Blu-ray's? they are growing fast, I can use most if not all blue-tooth devices in conjunction with the PS3 (headsets included), my Samsung TV recognized my PS3 and I am able to use the TV remote to control my PS3, and I can stream music, pics, and video from my computer to my PS3. when watching youtube with a lot of people I only need to fire it up on my PS3 for a bigger better screen. I have loved Playstation products since the PS1 and I think this coupled with the new PS3 games that have been and continue to come out are great additions to the Playstation family.. It is quite literally the center of my media life. and with streaming music from my computer I don't have to cloud up hard drive space on the PS3. really an impressive product for the price. 

$$;
Pros:. blue ray!. 3D ready!. awesome!. free PSN. Awesome games. 
Cons:. No Bluetooth:(. Thats it. 
Summary:. A Cheaper and better way to play your games and watch your Blue Ray movies.. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in Wi-Fi. Blu-Ray Player. Games are stored on Blu-Rays (that don't scratch like DVDs). nVIDIA RSX powers the graphics and is more piwerful than xbox360. Cell-BE processor is built for speed and video. 120GB HDD is big. Most of all - it's SONY!. 
Cons:. PSN maybe insn't as good as XBOX Live - but it is free. Playstation Home has not yet reached its potential. Only 2 USB Ports and one is taken up by move (but can buy more ports). 
Summary:. The Playstation 3 System by SONY is the most advanced gaming system on the market. Its Blu-Ray drive allows for much more complex games that don't suffer from scratches and playing 1080p films with 7.1 surround sound. Built in bluetooth connects the controllers (which are motion sensitive) to the system, connects wireless headsets (avaliable cheaply from third-party manufacturers) and could theoretically be used to connect a keybord without the fuss of a USB cable. The graphics clearly beat the xbox on exclusive games (they are the same on most dual-platform games as they are written for 360 then translated into ps3). Playstation move admitidly looks like the Wii but I think it's actually Microsoft's Kinect that's like the Wii (just no controller) while SONY's move brings a whole new dimension of realism to the motion world. All in all, this system is not perfect - but it's the best that you can buy. Microsoft's dated system now shows its inferiority in the face of the PS3 - and I wont even mention the Wii. I am so glad I bought a Playstatiobn not an xbox.. 

$$;
Pros:. stays cool. easy to connect. blue tooth for mic. its free online play. can go on youtube(in case you want to look something up for the game your playing). internet browser. nice controller. 
Cons:. the media bar could be alot more pretty. online play. 
Summary:. it is far better than the xbox i own both and i like my ps3 better. i have big hands and the controller fits me better than the xbox one dose. blue ray is nice for games like final fantasy (it would have been bad to constantly have to switch out disks). blue tooth allows you to use cellphone head pieces for online play.. 

$$;
Pros:. -One of the best Blu-Ray players out there.. -Bluetooth remote = not necessary to aim remote at console (useful when you're lying comfortably under a blanket on the couch :-) ). -Updates bring most newest features soon as they're out (3D?). -Great deal. 
Cons:. Hopefully the next iteration is gonna add IR remote capacity (For compatibility with multi-device / universal remotes). 
Summary:. If you look at it, it is pretty much the best deal you can get out there: a kick-a** BD player coupled with an awesome game console. Not to mention all its multimedia capacities. Sorry XBOX... Sony had me at Blu-Ray.... 

$$;
Pros:. 1.bluray player 2.free online gaming. 
Cons:. i like everything. 
Summary:. the greatest product i ever bougth. 

$$;
Pros:. EVERYTHING. 
Cons:. NOTHING IT'S THE BEST.. 
Summary:. Buy one and you'll see what I mean. 

$$;
Pros:. Built-in Blu-ray player, hard drive, Wi-fi, gaming, easy to set up and use, great list of supported formats including DivX, can operate with my Harmony universal remote with a simple $29 I/R reader, easy wi-fi connection to Macs with proper software.. 
Cons:. Can't get Netflix on-line in Canada, would prefer a built-in I/R reader so i didn't have to purchase one.. 
Summary:. I highly recommend the PS3 120 GB Slim to anyone considering adding a Blu-ray player to their home entertainment system. Compare it feature by feature to any stand-along Blu-ray player and it offers as much or more than anything else for the money. Any $150 Cdn Blu-ray player will play movies just fine, but if you want on-board wi-fi for easy firmware updates you're into the $250+ area. And by the way, this unit lets you play games if you are so inclined.. A notable feature is the wide range of supported video and audio formats. I'm not aware of anything that this unit will not play, while many of the lower priced Blu-ray players have limits. I originally bought a Sony BDP-S360 and decided to return it when I realized it wouldn't play some of the discs that my kids school plays and photos were saved on. Not sure what format they were, but the PS3 plays them.. The only drawback to the PS3 is it's lack of an infrared remote reader. This can be a minor pain to anyone who is making this part of a full entertainment system and is using a nice universal remote. But even this minor issue is easily solved by purchasing a separate I/R reader that plugs into the USB slot. I bought the PS3IR-X1 for $30 from Schartz.com and it works great with my Harmony remote - just needed to manually assign the OK button on the remote as the X button on the PS3 and all is well.. The slim design also allows the PS3 to fit in a regular audio component rack unlike the earlier PS3.. The hard drive is useful for storing photos and the slideshow software that Sony provides is very nice - the 'Ken Burns' effect seems to automatically zoom in on faces in the photos. It's also very easy to link to home computers via wi-fi and do live slide shows or play music without physically connecting the computers to the system.. All in all, I'm very pleased with this device.. 

$$;
Pros:. i love playing online. 
Cons:. i have 120 gb and i dont know if thats enough space and the games are a little pricey. 
Summary:. i have the 120gb and i love it ive never had a problem with it but ive only had it for about a month now and im considering the warrenty but im wondering if its worth buying. 

$$;
Pros:. had mine since it came out no problems. 
Cons:. nothing grate system. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluray Games and movies :). 
Cons:. more ports usb and ethernet. 

$$;
Pros:. wifi. bluetooth. blue-ray. much, much, much, much more. 
Cons:. Absolutely none. 
Summary:. Sony is the best console maker by far. Sony is giving you a blu-ray equipped incredible game system with free online. Xbox 360 doesn't come close. And all this comes at an irresistible price. If you don't have a PS3, I have a question. Why don't you?. 

$$;
Pros:. 120 GB Hard Drive. Built In Wifi. Free Online PSN Service. Buy and rent movies on PSN. Store Music,Videos, and pictures. Blu Ray. DVD Upscaling. HDMI. Optical Out. 2 USB ports which can also be used for memory. Media Server Capabilities. Web Browser With Flash. 
Cons:. No Linux but I really dont care so much about it. 
Summary:. I wanted a console that does not get problems like my older Xbox 360. It broke 4 times ! THe red ring of death. The games sucked I hated Halo. I had to pay 60 $ for online and 80 $ for Wifi . I also had to pay 10 bucks for batteries for controllers and 30 $ for a memory card. THEN, the stupid console itself which was 200 $ . I wasted so much money on that garbage thing. So I sold it and all its trash and bought this . And I tell everyone, its AMAZING. It has everything the Xbox 360 does not have . It plays blu rays and upscales DVDs. It plays games that have amazing graphics. And its at a great price , 300 $? Thats great. People say that the xbox is cheaper but you end up in so much trouble that it sucks. Trust me buy this thing instead.. 

$$;
Pros:. everything. 
Cons:. nothing its beast. 
Summary:. buy it without question. 

$$;
Pros:. I love This system This my first Playstation 3 System Great Realistic Graphics. Good job Sony. 
Cons:. Could Make the Game save feature Better Make it Where Cheat codes Don't Disable Game Saving. 
Summary:. I love this system It's a great System For my first Playstation 3/blu-ray Disc Player/Media Player/Divx Player. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu Ray, HD audio bitstream out to receiver (Slim only), crazy amounts of options to fully customze everything, hard drive upgrade feature, excellent XMB interface, perfect media server playback quality, USB KB/mouse support, great gaming, netflix.. 
Cons:. No PS2 support, no Gameshark/Codebreaker option...you know, for those that would appreciate the option to barrel through games with guns blazing and minimal effort, or for a crazy second playthrough.. 
Summary:. I have both the PS3 and the elite black X360. I compared both extensively, for my own sanity....that's how I do...lol... I can say that overall, the PS3 is a much better overall device. In fact, the only feature where I found that the X360 beat out the PS3 was the insanely well developed online content/community section. Otherwise:. PS3:. Smaller, quieter drive and fans, runs cooler. Better game graphics. Richer sound. Better interface. Better media playerquality/disc player software. Rechargeable controllers. Wireless. trayless drive. non-proprietary device support. extreme level of options for picky techies. 

$$;
Pros:. great console only games such as God of war 3, Uncharted2, Killzone2, MGS4, The gran turismo series, FREE online play, great controller, blu-ray, great online, looks great, XMB is easy,so many features. 
Cons:. none really except you cant use any picture for your psn avatar. 
Summary:. For me the ps3 is better because with 360 I would have to pay to go online i would have to buy the wifi adapter and gold which is 60$ but with ps3 those things come FREE! People say ps3 controllers are dumb because you have to buy a new one when the battery turns really bad but that will happen in like 4years but with 360 your always going to pay 60$ dollars EVERY year. I prefer ps3 exclusives over 360 i mean gears of war and halo are great but mw2 and badcompany2 are just alot better and Left4Dead2 isnt for me i would rather play mw2:).the ps3 has bluray which is replacing the dvd and also ps3 games can be alot more detailed because bluray discs=50ishGB of storage while DVD=9. also with my ps3 has no problems and i have played mw2 for 9hrs straight and no sign of overheating while with 360 you cant play for as long. Also if you want to store ALOT of stuff ps3 is better it supports more formats and the harddrives for it are bigger because you can get any 2.5inch harddrive and install it easily using the instruction manual while 360 is stuck with the biggest size being only 250GB. in my opinion i prefer ps3 controllers because i have small hands and im really used to playstation controllers because I have been with it starting form PS1 but thats just a preference ive also seen a ps3 controller that is the same layout as 360 but its 3rd party so id rather stick with the DS3. And really I have both systems with XBOXlivegold and they are pretty much the same thing with a few differences like trophies and gamerpoints but i use my ps3 more and once my year of gold ends im not buying another year unless microsoft does something big to change my mind.graphic wise same thing except with ps3 exclusives such as god of war 3 look way better than 360 like it looks so realistic i felt as if i was watching a movie. I highly reccomend ps3 due to its features and exclusives and online. 

$$;
Pros:. Smaller than the older systems, bigger harddrive, DOESNT OVERHEAT like the old systems are prone to, gameplay seems alot smoother than older systems also. A HIGHLY recommended upgrade. 
Cons:. not back wards compatbale, only two usb ports. 
Summary:. My old system was a backwards compatbale, 4 usb port, rebuilt PS 3. I dont miss the backwards compatablity, I got to where I didnt play my old PS 2 games anymore anyways (except Downhill Domintaion) The PS 3 games are so much better. I wish theyd make a downhill domintauion for PS 3. Anyways, muy old system acted weird, finally traded it in on a new one and couldnt be happier. The new one is 1/2 the old ones size almost. Gameplay is smooth, never choppy. Playing online multiplayer with the old system was a mess, Ive been playing Bioshock 2 multiplayer every evening since it came out-no complaints. If you are thinking of trading in the old system for a new one, DO IT. Then play games like Bioshock 1 and 2 on it. Its amazing!. 

$$;
Pros:. the ps3 is better that any other system i have played about every game for 360 and for ps3 and truly ps3 is way better at everything 360 only sold more becuse of its 1 year head start and ps3 still is about to beat 360 ps3 4 life. 
Cons:. online sometime lags hardly though only when there is to much people. 
Summary:. this is the best system a person could buy you dot go wrong buying it. 

$$;
Pros:. its a spaceship, i love it, better then xbox360 all around, blu ray to games to dvds online. Im a reall picky guy, believe me, buy this you wont regret it, recommend with hdmi cable and hdtv at 1080p to get maximum.. 
Cons:. can get enough time to play and watch blu rays. no cons, absolutely good in this unperfect world.. 
Summary:. I play online gaming alot, call of duty as most of you probably played it, its famous, I love watching blu ray on my hdtv. To get the very best picture and quality sound all around, need to have hdtv @ 1080p, recomend the 120 hz or 240 hz motion for some games and some blu rays and remember, always use hdmi cable, it gives you the best picture and sound. Buy ps3 and get yourself the call of duty mw2 and world at war and rent a few flicks, I guerrantied that a husband or wife that cheats wont cheat no more. jajaa, its a good product, i rocomend it. 

$$;
Pros:. - Games are immersive and varied. - Awesome HD output video and sound (with any kind of option you can imagine). - Easy upgradable Hard Drive. - Wireless out of the box. - Expansive online service for free game demos, videos, music, themes etc. - Reliable. 
Cons:. You will never turn it off. 
Summary:. - There are plenty of games you must play in your life that are only available on this system: the thrill ride and top notch production of "Uncharted 2", the expansive and creative "LittleBigPlanet" and the EPIC "Metal Gear Solid 4".. - When you need to take a break watch a movie on any format, DVD, Blue Ray, mp4s from your USB drive, or hook up to Youtube all on your HDTV. Go wash some dishes or chat with friends while your PS3 plays MP3s with higher quality than my Macbook does.. - Hook up to PSN for tons of free demos, news videos, trailers, themes and more. Then look into creative game experiences like Flower or Echodrome. Rent movies through Netflix, or use your PS3 as a phone (like skype) with video chatting through your HDTV.. - When you are tired and want to go to sleep, give back and help fight cancer by donating your powerful processor to folding proteins with Stanford University and Sony's "life with playstation" program.. - Rediscover some classic PSone games. They seem to be upscaled too! Everything just looks better going through the PS3. If you have an older model play some PS2 games, or pray with me that the rumours of future PS2 and Dreamcast (!!!) compatibility is to come.. I've had my PS3 slim for 2 months now and I am completely sold on the device. It is hardly ever off and serves all my needs, even when not staring at the screen. I love it and am continuously surprised just how CHEAP it is when you consider all the things it does! Highly recommended.. 

$$;
Pros:. Upgradeable HDD, bluetooth, built in wi-fi, tons of fun top rated games, low cost of ownership, free online play, PSP connectivity, Blu-ray playback, Folding@home, PS Store has a decent selection of movie and game titles as well.. 
Cons:. Loss of other OS install support on the new slim, gloss finish on original was a fingerprint and dust magnet, the new one is a coarse finish dust magnet, uses Blu-Ray exclusively, limited legacy title support, no widgets or 3rd party XMB app support.. 
Summary:. I would love to see a widget/app/software store to extend the usability of Sony's most recent gaming platform. On the whole, I love my PS3, and though recently I've been on a love/hate roller coaster with Sony about their PSP, I am generally pleased with their products, PS3 and TVs are a given.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu ray,DVD.CD player, amazing games,free online membership,built in WiFi,ultimate multimedia device,out of the box internet browser,obviously a better choice than any gaming consoles out there!. 
Cons:. some of the accessories are quite expensive and some players in the PSN dont have headsets (including me..). 
Summary:. greatest console i have owned,it does many things other than gaming and. it doesnt fail to dissapoint me.. 

$$;
Pros:. really good grapics, blue ray, free ps3 live, and the best games. 
Cons:. theres nottin i dont like. 

$$;
Pros:. When Xbox360 came out we thought "wow look how good the graphics are" then PlayStation 3 came out.. 
Cons:. To pricey no ir. 
Summary:. When the PlayStation 3 came out the processor was ripped on now it is one of the best processor the Xbox uses a pc based processor Which is clocked at 3.2Ghz, now Sony's (and IBM and Toshiba) Cell Broadband Engine Is clocked at the same speed. Now most people think it is a seven core It is only a singel core, But it has 7 spe's. Now the problem with the CBE it is harder for game developers to program but. Now lets talk what thoughs spe's do each spe has a duty now the power processor is the one that gives thogh duty to the spe's now game developers can only work with six of them which is plenty of room for developers.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good looking and well built. Lots of power under the good. Blue ray and Netflix work great. Wonderful gaming graphics and physics.. 
Cons:. PS3 controller is aweful. Just to damn small and bad layout. Sony please change this or offer a version for people with normal sized hands...lol.. 
Summary:. If you only use it for Netflix and Blue ray its well worth the money. But if you use the gaming part then its the best deal out there. I think the xbox360 is now clearly overpriced. No blue ray, no bluetooth, no integrated WiFi. If the PS3 is 300.00 then the xbox should be 200.00 with integrated WiFi. By the way I am not a XBOX hater. I think its the best pure gaming console and best online service.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD Gaming. FULL HD 1080p Blu-ray Player. WiFi (802.11b/g). HDMI 1.3a. Built-in Upgradeable HDD (Non proprietary). FREE PSN Account. Web browser (Pandora, Facebook, Last.fm, YouTube, Twitter, and SO MUCH More). Media extender (Windows Media, TVersity, etc). 
Cons:. Lack of backwards compatibility for PS2 games. 
Summary:. I currently own a PS2 (SCPH-39001), an Xbox 360 (Pro 20GB), and most recently a PS3 (Slim 120 GB). I was ecstatic when I received the PS3 as a holiday 2009 gift. I was intending to purchase at the current MSRP of $299, but I think free is an even better price.. At first glance, it's obviously a game console. I purchased UNCHARTED: Drake's Fortune and UNCHARTED2: Among Thieves. The PlayStation 3 packs the punch of the Cell Broadband Engine?. I suggest doing a Google Search for "explain the cell ps3" and click the first link.. The PS3 has an HDMI 1.3a port for high definition gaming. Not every game on the console will be in 1080p, but EVERY Blu-ray movie is in FULL 1080p. Blu-ray has been established as the standard format in which it will be taking the place of DVD (like DVD took the place of VHS). Every PlayStation 3 game is stored on a Blu-ray disc. Blu-ray discs have a storage capacity in upwards of 50GB, while DVDs can store up to 4.7GB. Benefits of Blu-ray are quite obvious (more content, more audio channels, higher definition pixels).. The PS3 has a built-in 2.5 inch Serial ATA HDD. This is a standard laptop hard drive, and it's upgradable. No proprietary hardware needed from Sony to do so. It doesn't void the warranty either.. WiFi is built-in also. This makes it so much easier when the internet connection is located in the room down the hall, and you don't have Ethernet cable running across your home. No equipment to buy, all you need is your WiFi key and an active internet connection.. The web is also on the PS3. You can view full web pages of almost any website on the internet. Pandora Radio is one of my favorites, and I was shocked when I tried to load it on PS3. It worked as though I was on my desktop machine. Facebook and YouTube are also honorable mentions that both work on the PS3 web browser.. Media extension is a very valuable feature to me. I like having the ability of viewing all my content from my computer on my PS3. Very handy feature, and FREE. It was a little difficult setting up due to computer issues, but it works like a charm now.. My only complaint was the lack of PS2 backwards compatibility. I really would have loved to pack my old dusty PS2 away, but it's not that big of a problem.. I also have heard rumor that Sony is planning on releasing PlayStation 2 games for download via the online PlayStation Store. PSone titles are already available for download. Keep in mind, you will need a credit/debit/bank account for purchase. You can also buy prepaid PS Store cards at retail locations like Target and Walmart in several amounts ($20, $50, etc). All in all, I think that PS3 is an amazing product. I don't regret acquiring it at all. The games are beautiful! The Blu-ray movies are awesome! And the price isn't all the bad either. The "It only does EVERYTHING" advertisements really fit the PS3. Get one, you WON'T regret it at all.. 

$$;
Pros:. Where do i begin here oh yeah it has blue ray, better graphics then crappy 360 games, built in wifi so u dont have to buy a adapter for it like the 360, free online gaming which u save ur self 50 bucks, super quite,and it is smaller then the 360.. 
Cons:. there is now problems with it.. 
Summary:. i like it because it does everything.

Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Not backwards capable.

Pros:. -slim -Bluetooth -built in wi-fi -built-in blu-ray -Best games -Netflix streaming -No rrod -Big hard drive that's user upgradable -Free Playstation Network service -Web browser -Motion sensitive controllers -Up to 1080p and 7.1 surround sound.. 
Cons:. -Doesn't come with an HDMI cable. -No backwords compatibility for PS2 games.(However, I don't care about that. Ever since I got a PS3, I forgot all about PS2). 

$$;
Pros:. quiet. efficient. smaller than first version. failure rate way less than Xbox. 
Cons:. its an electronic device and can fail. online use is not as good as Xbox live. graphics are not as good as Xbox 360. 
Summary:. its great, better than xbox has lower failure rate than xbox, slim, light, quieter, looks good, good graphics, great games on ps3, uses less energy than original ps3, doesnt over heat as much because of less power consumption. and size. overall i love ps3 slim.. 

$$;
Pros:. Massive versatility in the firmware including divx and and the display of photos within the OS.. 
Cons:. Seems like an attempt to renew interest in a machine that in theory shud and infact is better than all of it's competitors... 
Summary:. I should start this off by saying MY playstation 3 does charge it's controllers whilst the system is on and as such have no idea what the previous cnet review is talking about it also bost's 4 usb ports as opposed to that of the 2 and yes i suppose i should replace the hard disk drive although that'll only cost me around �30 instead of the �150 that the local games shops are asking (and this is infact to loose 2 usb ports (apparently the ability to charge the controllers whilst the system is on) and the choice to install linyx if i so feel fit. So what am i paying for? it seems to me all im doing is loosing and once again lining Sony's pockets. Dont get me wrong Sony havecreated an incredible machine and great value for money if you already own one although the upgrade to me iis nothing but a gimmick and is worse value depending on which version of the ooriginal playstation 3 you own. In Summary if you dont own a PS3 run to the shops now it will be the best technological decision you'll ever make however if you already own the 'fat' one whats the point?. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu ray player is excellent, DVD upconversion, Wifi ready, Netflix access, Excellent gaming device, Nice user friendly interface and software.. 
Cons:. Remote is blue tooth controlled and hence cant use universal remote. Sony should really work on it. I cant comment on the gaming devise as I am not a game freak and have not used Wii or Xbox. But I am happy with the games which I played in PS3.. 
Summary:. I was actually looking for buying a blu ray player.. When I came across this combo device of Blu ray player, Wifi connectivity, netflix access and excellent gaming device for comparable price, I did not had any second thought but to buy this immediately... And believe me I am more than satisfied with this purchase... I usually research a lot before any gadget purchase. And am not as happy as this purchase compared all other gadgets at my house... I will definitely recommend this to my friends who usually take my advise before purchase of any gadgets... 

$$;
Pros:. Lot better in cooling and heating issues! Love the new Firmware!. 
Cons:. Liked the old glossy look tht the 80GB had!. 
Summary:. If ur looking for a Blu-Ray player go for a Sony PS3! Get More...... 

$$;
Pros:. The Playstation 3 has great game titles, easy to navigate menu, web browser, Blu-ray/DVD/CD player, and free online gaming. It can play music also with the ability to upgrade you hard drive and a WiFi adapter installed.. 
Cons:. No PS2 compatibility, but that's not big seeing as your buying a Playstation 3 to play Playstation 3 games.. 
Summary:. Th PS3 is the best system if you want to experiance more than just games. The PS3 is hands down the best for a one place home entertainment system. You can play music, surf the web, play videos from your usb flash drive, and watch Blu-ray and DVD's. That's only the home entertainment part. The games for the PS3 keep getting better and better. With the Xbox 360 I can only think of three games that intrest me, Halo 3, Gears of War 2, and GTA 4: Episodes fro LIberty City. With the PS3 I can think of quite a few, such as Metal Gear Solid 4, Killzone 2, Grand Turismo 5 Prologue, and Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. I'm only listing ones that are out now. In the near future, the PS3 will have many more exclusives like Agent, Grand Turismo 5, LA Noire, Heavy Rain, and The Agency. The PS3 is just begining to see all the power it has to offer while the Xbox 360 is about maxed out. Even if you have no intention of using the PS3 as a Blu- ray player or to play high-def games, it still is a better buy than the Xbox 360. In the words of a Sony ad campain, "It only does Everything.". 

$$;
Pros:. Great blu ray player. Awsome games now with a good library. A+ titles to be released from now through x mas.. 
Cons:. would like a HDMI cable included.. 
Summary:. Awesome game system with great games, excellent blu ray player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, No bulky PSU, slick styling, grown up interface, console rechargeable and bluetooth controllers, BBC iPlayer streaming capability out of the box (UK Models Only), quieter than previous console, top quality blu ray player, new lower price.. 
Cons:. Short USB lead for controller charging, 2.5 inch HDD drive (should be 3.5 inch), noisy disc loading, web browser requires too many updates such as adobe flash.. 
Summary:. Having had an Xbox360 for 3 years, moving onto the PS3 is a breath of fresh air. The whole experience is much more slick and you can feel and see the quality of the console and the software.. Connectivity of the console is very good, although it has been said that there is a lack of a rear USB port for an external HDD. The 1080 full HD experience is the best and much better than the Xbox's 720 HD capabilities, especially when I have spent plenty of money on a descent television.. The PS3 fits in with the room and it's unobtrusive and looks good, it's quiet and you may not even realise it's running. When in disc operation, the motors are quiet and the heat output of the unit is relatively low.. I enjoy streaming legal media from the internet and in the UK, the BBC have a particularly excellent service. This capability is built into the PS3 so I have no need to worry about satellite or cable TV subscriptions.. Overall this is a wonderful piece of kit and for whatever faults it may have, it takes the title of king of the consoles. Good job Sony and thank you!.

Pros:. 1. Blu-ray. 2. HD Graphics(better than 360). 3.True 1080p. 4.Smaller and Lighter. 
Cons:. 1. Physical buttons( i like the touch sensitive better). 2.If you have kids like me buy the ps3 fat. 
Summary:. The ps3 slim is the best console on the market. Better than the 360 and way better than the wii. Its smaller and lighter than the original ps3 with to me is a great thing. Just go out and buy it.. 

$$;
Pros:. great unit, cheaper, smaller, lighter uses less power then the old one, fan noise is the same, it gets warm but thats normal, neither the slim or my old one ever overheated!. 120gb hdd standard, hdd upgrade easy if needed, vastly improved wifi range!. 
Cons:. the old one looked better,but its not like that matters much as one generally looks at the tv while playing or watching or surfing etc. not stable vertically without a stand! stand not here yet and is slightly overpriced, solution? have it flat :). 
Summary:. the negative reviews on this site? backwards comparability? all recent ps3's didn't have it either and to be honest when i first got my phat ps3 it was an issue so i bought a slim ps2 as they where dirt cheap and over the 3 or so years i havnt played it once. overheated? never! weak online experience? its free and i haven't had issues over the last 3 years with my old ps3. OS probs? none again over 3 years. the blu ray remote has all the dvd options i don't know what ppl are going on about there and its bluetooth too instead of IR, so you dont have to point directly at it at all, now everyone else needs to catch up. oh and by less features do you mean not being able to install Linux? thats the only difference and i mean come on Linux? get real who uses that? like 0.5% of ps3 owners. and to the ppl saying it has inferior graphics to the xbox, i say ******** i have both systems and on multi platform games there is little to no difference BOTH have there graphical pros and cons, its personal preference really, and also to those ppl have you seen uncharted 2? like actually played it? because i have the beta and it is by far the best looking game i have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture clarity and no fears if you are owrried about buying it with no bundled games just as long as you have an internet connections this will keep you entertained for a VERY long time.. 
Cons:. Tried using my USB keyboard and mouse and they did not work when trying to play COD4 modern combat.. 
Summary:. This is the best gaming console you can buy for your money!. Als serves as a DVD/BLUE RAY player.. Highly suggest getting this over other gaming sytems for sure!. 

$$;
Pros:. -Great blu ray player. -Incredible gaming console with a huge game library and more games coming out. -Integrated wifi and power supply. -Same great features as the old ps3's. -Stunning design and very compact. -Great value!!!. -And much more. 
Cons:. -PSN still needs some improvement compared to Xbox Live. -Needs IR for universal remotes. -Maybe it should have MORE unique features. -Include the vertical stand!!!. -Would like backwards compatiblity. 
Summary:. I still remember when I bought the first 60gb ps3. Oh BOY was it expensive (I think it was a little than 600 bucks). Despite the fact of the high price, it was a HELL of a machine. Blu ray rocks! Now that the ps3 has gotten much cheaper, I think Sony knows what they're doing and the ps3 is going to be more kickass. The ps3 is mainly intended for intense graphic games and fps's, but it does have a library of family games. If you want to play family games, I suggest to just get the Wii. Otherwise, stick to the ps3 or the Xbox 360. Now don't get me wrong, both consoles are amazing. Each has its own pros and cons. But the ps3 is my choice in the end. It's true that Xbox live is better PSN and its gaming library is still bigger, but later on, things will probably change. As there are more and more software updates, PSN will get better (I assume) and more games will come. And even though Microsoft is releasing Natal, Sony also has a motion controller coming out. It may not be as hype, but it could end up being better. So in the end, if you like a blu ray player combined with a gaming console that has a pretty interface and a great gaming library, this is probably your choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. blu-ray; versatility; media server; 1080p; simply awesome. 
Cons:. there is nothing I don't like about this product.. 
Summary:. Great value, unbelievable versatility.. 

$$;
Pros:. slimmer desgn, more energy efficient, 120 GB. 
Cons:. only it doesnt have backwards compatibility. 
Summary:. since it has a better price now and it has some more stuff than the 80 GB ps3 and xbox 360 elite it would be a good console to buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Blue Ray Player, Equal quality to the 360 for games, huge hard drive, smaller design than original, less sexy matte black holds up to wear MUCH better, "real" computer aspects, very quiet, and a sturdy and stable design.. 
Cons:. Not backwards compatible, no HDMI cable, LOAD TIMES.. 
Summary:. I called myself an XBOX fan boy for the sake of those taking a quick glance wondering if the PS3 slim was worth the money. In truth I have always been a little partial to XBOX/360 but I have always had all the consoles.. The PS3 slim was an easy choice for me. I doubt I would have bought it just for the high quality exclusive titles it offers ( Little Big Planet, God of War 3 and MGS4 just to name a few of the real big guns Drake's Fortune was the one I really wanted and I beat it the first few days I had the system. Great game!) but the fact it is also a Blue Ray player, and one of the best reviewed on the market to boot made this a literal no brainier.. I was just waiting for the inevitable price cut since buying BR movies is not a high priority for me at the current cost, and I already had two 360's to meet my gaming needs. I'm really glad my frugality caused me to wait though as I feel the Slim is a step up.. I know that the shine black is really a great looking piece of consumer electronics ascetically speaking, but the system scratches if you blink at it hard. I don't care for the matte black appearance as much, but I know it will still look great after a year, where every PS3 I have seen looks like it was dragged across the ground.. In addition to the look, you get the 120GB hard drive and a (in some cases) quieter and smaller system with no loss of features or power. In electronics smaller is usually better, especially when it comes to my crowded home entertainment set up real estate.. There are a few things I prefer about the 360 over the Sony product, but it's pure personal preference and anyone claiming either system is vastly superior should be ignored. For me, the PS3 could not be my only gaming console. I prefer the XBOX Live experience (despite having to pay for it compared to the free Playstation network) from community to functionality. I like the 360 controllers better (with the exception of some fighting games. Tekken on a 360 controller would have been rough) and I like the interface of the 360 better.. Again though, these things are personal preference. Comparing the PS3 Slim to an XBOX 360 Elite could be a tough call for the objective buyer.. The Quality is there, the functionality is there, the price is right, and the added benefit of a top rated Blue Ray player makes this a smart buy for both hard core and somewhat casual gamers. It does everything it should, and it does it pretty much perfectly.. 

$$;
Pros:. Had to call dell and speak with a rep to get the code applied. Plugging it in will not work. Shipping is free and you have to pay tax. Not bulky, noisy, or an energy hog like the PS3 unit I used to have (it was stolen).. 
Cons:. Games are expensive.. 
Summary:. A great bargin for the money. I plan on upgrading the hard drive and storing all my media.. 

$$;
Pros:. It does almost evverything perfectly, and does what i want best: GAMES!. Uncharted 2, GOW 3 etc etc, amazing titles are coming out soon. 
Cons:. New look may not appeal to some. 
Summary:. If you want a console for 299$, this is the best value. 

$$;
Pros:. Upscaled DVD player, Blu-Ray, Tilt sensor in controllers, 120 Gigs, internet Browser, playstation network is FREE, Conntrollers have bluetooth, psp conectivity, Plays CDs, Quiet, High Definition, And so much more.. 
Cons:. DualShock 3 controllers are Ridiculously expensive and have a bit of a learning curve, Has great games, but Xbox 360 and the Wii have more.. 
Summary:. On august 29th, i turned 13. Our family owned a wii, but i began to find 80% of its games boring. My little brother has a psp, and i wanted a ps3 so bad. when learned of the ps3 slim and its lower price, i knew it was time. i sold all my ds games but 1, 2 wii games, my game cube, and got $130 at gamestop. I tallied up the money my mother owed me, and got $170. so i bought myself a ps3. 3 words: FEATURES, FEATURES, FEATURES. Yes, all 3 are Unbelievably abundunt in the ps3. high-definition is AMAZING, And Blu-Ray is Great. Built in WiFi is good, and playstation is cool. In terms of games, I have Ratchet and Clank Future: tools of destruction, and it looks and feels amazing. Bottom line if you are looking for a Gaming/multimedia console, the PS3 Slim is the way to go.. 

$$;
Pros:. bluray,slim design,wifi and 120gb hd and ps3 exclusive games. 
Cons:. playstation network~its no xbox live thats for sure,no back compat. 
Summary:. its a awesome bluray player and a great gaming and media hub for your home theater and a price you cant beat. 

$$;
Pros:. this "product" looks sweet also less power consumption = more money to spend on dlc from the brilliant psn store. 
Cons:. i dunno may the whole no ir thing but i bought two controllers and the both work fine. 
Summary:. ps3 owns period. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent media center, worth $300 alone to store all of your media content on (DVD's, pictures, music, etc) as well as play BD.. 
Cons:. I do not know of any; again I did not buy this unit as a gaming machine. I bought it for the BD player and the media center potential. As for games, I will let the others flame each other back and forth about that.. 
Summary:. I will not get into the gamer side of things and instead will explain an area in which the PS3 is very powerful. I have been attempting to figure out the best way to copy our couple hundred family DVD's onto a hard drive for some time and play them without physically having to have the kids put them in the DVD player. I could have built a home media center on a stand alone computer but did not want to deal with that. I tried XBMC but still had some issues. All of our IT guys at work had the PS3 and told me to go that route. After reading on the best approach for this I have ripped our collection of movies with DVDFab 6 and then use Handbrake to compress them with H264 compression. Then I place tthese movies that are now a couple gigs on a USB external hard drive attached to the PS3. We can not watch all of the DVD's that we own in perfect reproduction and with DD 5.1 audio by just clicking on them. When you couple that with the BD player and the built-in WiFi it just made a lot of sense to go this route for me.. Since I am not attempting to even get into an argument either way about games I am really stating that this unit is an excellent media center and if you are not using it for that (and have a lot of DVD) you are missing out on the convenience of this option as well as not having a bunch of scratched DVDs.. In regards to the "fat" vs. the "slim" unit I see no real reason to get the slim unit over the fat other than it is now more affordable. The other thing that I would recommend if you buy either the PS3 or the XBOX 360 is to purchase them from Costo or Sams Club because if either of them croak you can bring them back no matter how long you have had them.The five stars giving is for the PS3 in general because there really is not enough of a difference for someone to go out and get the slim model if they already own the fat model. AND, the bottom line to me is for the area of media center and not games. Again, I searched for some time for the best option to put all of our DVD movies on a hard drive and not have to touch them anymore and this fit the bill. It was either go this route or have a dedicated computer on to stream them and this made the most sense.. Last thing: when our IT guys said to go out and get a PS3 for what I was wanting to do I did not want to spend the money but did. Looking back it was a great purchase. Now that the price has come down it is an even better route to go if you are attempting to do what I did.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Silent. 2. Runs cool and looks cool. 3. The finish on top is very nice with no fingerprints.. 4. Small, lite, and portable. 
Cons:. Drive is very Loud but thats it.. 
Summary:. Its awesome easy set up and is a very beautiful system!. BUY BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Larger hard drive, bluetooth, wifi, best Blu-ray player on the market, upgradable hard drive, allows non-proprietary accessories, runs quieter/cooler/more efficiently. 
Cons:. no HDMI cable in box. 
Summary:. For $299, you get both an excellent gaming system and fantastic blu-ray/dvd playback. Plus, this is the most reliable hardware currently offered (compare to the 33%+ failure rate on the 360). Basically, an ideal combination of price, functionality, and reliability!. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray/DVD Player - The Best Blu-Ray Player Available.. Online is Free - I always hated having to pay $50 a year for XBox Live.. Way more Reliable than my 360.... Built In Hard Drive and Wireless.. 
Cons:. No HiDef Cables Included.. No Infrared Receiver, but BD Remote is inexpensive.. 
Summary:. No HiDef Cables Included.. If you want Component Cables or HDMI you have to purchase separate, you can get them cheap, HDMI is all Digital so you DO NOT have to waste money on those Expensive Cables. Also, the PS2 uses the Same AV MultiOut Connector so if you are using Component (Red,Green,Blue,White,Blue) you can get that just about anywhere for cheap as well.. I personally own all 3 systems. The PS3, Wii and the 360.. The PS3 is my Favorite.. The Wii has some neat games but the Graphics are a little weak.... My 1st 360 got the Red Ring of Death 3 Times, then my Warranty Ran out. I tried getting it repaired but it was Finally DEAD... I have since bought a used one because my son still plays Halo with his Hockey Buddies from Time to Time, we will see how long that one lasts.... For a Family the Free PSN is ideal.. On our XBox360 we have to share a Live account because XBox Live is $49 per Year per Person!!! So as a Family of 4 Gamers there is NO WAY we would pay $200 a year just so we can play our $60 game in Mulit-Player. I have always hated that... The Buddy List is pretty Broken when you have to share 1 account.... Having used both PSN and XBox Live both work just fine for Online Play. Live has slightly better Invite System but it just doesn't work well when you have to share a Buddy List so I give the edge to PSN for that Reason alone.. The Games are Spectacular. Each System has it's Exclusives. I would call them pretty even there. I really Love the Halo Series, but Killzone, Resistance, Warhawk, Socom are all Great Series as well. Little Big Planet was a pleasant surprise. It is a Side Scrolling Platform Game, but the Innovative part is that you can create your own levels and the degree of creative freedom is remarkable. This makes for unlimited re-playability of this game. Almost a year later and we Still play this game on a Regular Basis with all 4 of us this is one of the Best Co-Op Family Games around in my opinion. There are People who make Levels that are Near perfect Replicas of Mario Levels.. With the Price at $299 now this is the Best Valued system.. The 360 with HardDrive is $299 but there is No Built in Wireless and then you have to Pay $49 a year for XBox Live... $299 + $99 for Wireless + $49 a year really adds up.. 

$$;
Pros:. 45nm processors. 
Cons:. new logo. should kept "PS3" in 'spiderman3' font. that's the only con for me.. omg, it's minor!. 
Summary:. frakk BC. when i purchased the original 60GB PS3, one year after launch, it had BC, but not once had i used it to play a PS2 game. i sold my PS2 within weeks.. for me, previous iterations of a franchise title will never be popped back in. there's no point...not for reminiscing, not for comparing, and not for laughs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just the fact that is capable of playing Blu-ray is worth the purchase of this system. That is exactly why I bought mine over a year ago. Blu-Ray movies have been comming done in price and you can even get some newer titles at BJs for 10 bucks. I. 
Cons:. Not many just a matter of opinion of what is really important to you.. You have to buy media server software to stream videos from NetFlix. 
Summary:. Great value at a great price and maybe it will finally make the other makers of the game consoles to finally drop the price of the xbox and the Wii.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is exactly what I like in new consoles, games etc. They didn't try to reinvent the wheel they just made the graphics better, added accessories and gave me everything I could want or need in a video game system.. 
Cons:. When it first came out there were no games for the system.. 

$$;
Pros:. The BIG Pro is that the price went down. It is energy efficient which doesn't heat it up at all. It is lighter, smaller and has a nice design and easy access to the hard drive.. 
Cons:. It is not as shiny as before although in order to have such a low price you must pay the price.. 
Summary:. The new renovated ps3 slim is a focused gaming console hands down without the lenux os or al the other extras this version makes it les confusing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent gameconsole w/ great games: Equal to XBox360 for some, but better than XB for other games. But also the best Blu-ray player on the market. Supports DLNA for multimedia streaming of Hulu/Netflix. Price was the only real barrier, now gone.. 
Cons:. Lack of PS2 Backwards compatibility is lame. I find Sony's attitude on this simply arrogant. Yes, it does matter folks. But it still plays PS1 games and better than a PS1 can on today's HDTVs,; I own lots of these and NO PS2 games, so works for me.. 
Summary:. Wii owners have been attracted by the price and simple innovative fun of that console; however, in today's HD age, the Wii is horribly dated. Now that price difference is a moot issue, Sony must immediately make Wii-style motion games available and standard in all games, introduce some cheap Wii-style games like bowling &#38; Tennis (maybe through PSN download, or even with a firmware release for free). Do it right, and Sony will win with the casual player, now growing bored with their SD Wiis and the failure of Wii to scale. Against XBOX360, it helps those on the fence. Dedicated gamers may still prefer XB because of XBOX Live's perceived (premium) superiority and some games like Halo and Gears of War that appeal disproportionately to dedicated gamers. Sony should write them off. Halo/GoW are XBOX360 only, and there are plenty of great FPS for the rest of us. Incidentally, I would love to have Halo ;-) I am a Bungie fan from way back.... I bought my PS3 a year ago with my SonyCard for $299, now the current price, and felt it worth every penny. Blu-ray rentals (Netflix!) are just a no brainer. This is the way HD was meant to look!; the DVD up conversion is also very nice;, if not true HD; CDs are upconverted to 192KHz on my music system and sound beautiful; I can stream Hulu through DLNA (requires PlayOn on a PC). This is why I bought mine. Games were a bonus!. For games, they look gorgeous. I LIKE that PSN is free. I have a life and limited playtime; I WOULD never pay for XBOX LIVE myself. But I am NOT a dedicated gamer who would be willing to pay premium annual fees. But my son plays the incomparable Little Big Planet as well as Lego Star Wars and Indiana Jones and loves it. I sometimes play FPS shooters, and Ratchet &#38; Clank, and free demos, and with my son on his games. My wife would love Wii-style games with a GOOD motion controller (the current PS3 one sucks). What's the hold up, Sony? It's a niche of games, true, but why dismiss some simple fun games? Hurry up on that.. For the $299 I spent on my PS3 a year ago, I feel of that, I spent just $150 for an excellent BD player with excellent DVD upconversion and DLNA streaming--and upgradeable at that. A bargain! The remaining $150 replaced my PS1 with a HD compatible model and allowed me to leapfrog to the next generation of HD, web-enabled multiplayer games. A better deal than Wii and XBOX by far in my book. It's a brilliant machine.. At last, others can get the same bargain I've had for over a year. And yes, BD 2.0 is most definitely worth $150--the naysayers either haven't yet gone 1080p HD, have tiny HD screens, are blind, irrationally hate Sony, are bitter that HD DVD lost the HD disc wars, or oblivious that good streaming HD (supposedly already made BD obsolete) is a long way off in the United States because of our absolutely crap broadband infrastructure.. Incidentally, I stream HD sometimes on my Tivo HD from Netflix. It is quite a convenience but it is NO BD. Highly compressed, even worse than cable HD, which is also crap. While I love Netflix streaming, it is a different animal than BD even when it is "HD". I am ok with streaming chick flicks but watch Sci Fi blockbusters on BD (rental) exclusively. It is completely worth the wait. Superior visuals and sound is the point of HD afterall, and NOTHING beats BD for that.. Updated. on Aug 21, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. BLURay, DVD, Wireless Internet, CD's, and High Definition Games. . It's quiter and has a 120 gig harddrive. The ps3 fails less than 10% the xbox 360 fails at %54. 
Cons:. Online Area is finally really growing, and expanding to impressive standing.. 
Summary:. Lucky Folks who get the great price and the bigger harddrive..

Pros:. Average decent stand alone blue ray player 250.00 for 49.00 more you get one of the best blue ray players, great high def gaming , good innertnet experance (any usb wireless keyboard and mouse works), wifi, lan and hdmi support. How can you miss?.

This is perfect it will fit easily in my entertainment center and I get great gaming consule, excellent upscaling dvd player, blueray , and with wifi I dont need a seperate home entertainment pc and with a wireless keyboard a really decent living room internet experience. I so there on sept 1 LOL!!!!!!!!!!. Updated. on Aug 22, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. - $300, while many standalone blu-ray players go for $250. - $300, now instantly competes 360 in terms of price. N. Now the $250 for a Wii doesn't look so cheap anymore?. - A slimmer PS3, minus a few features(mentioned in cons)...for $100 cheaper.... 
Cons:. -No B/C but hey it's not necessity while I have a functioning PS2.. Many people are over-reacted far too much over this feature. Do yourself a favor and purchase a used PS2 for chump-change.. -The ability to install custom OS has been removed. 
Summary:. Let's hope they include B/C in a later firmware update for those who don't have the CHUMP-CHANGE.... 

$$;
Pros:. blu-ray,awesome exclusives,Its lighter and smaller than the "fat PS3" It is very quiet,It has better graphics than the Xbox 360,only 300 bucks now,it has a great value,Its power brick is built in,dosent have a high failure rate like the Xbox 360.. 
Cons:. No backwards compatibility with PS2 and PS1 games. Only 2 usb ports, No Media card reader built in. No IR Port. But even with those small amount of cons, the pros totally outwiegh the number of cons. The cons are only minor complaints.. 
Summary:. The PS3 is amazing, no doubt about it. It has the best blu-ray player on the planet built in, with Dolby Digital Tru-HD decoding built in. All its games are in glorious HD, cough cough unlike the wii. The exclusives on this console are way better than the ones on the Xbox 360, I mean come on!! Halo is getting old. So if u want an amazing blu-ray player and a gaming console, then this is the system for you. I mean its only 300 bucks. The wii is 250 bucks and u get a stupid system with lame games and bad graphics and it cant play movies. It has awesome exclusives like Metal Gear Solid 4, Resistance 2, Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, Gran Turismo 5, Ratchet &#38; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, Ratchet &#38; Clank: A Crack in Time, Infamous, Wipeout HD, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift and many other great games. So I highly recommend this system to everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Free online play, buit in internet browser, user created themes, built in WiFi, blutooth, upcoming exclusives, slimmer and more reliable, home, scratch resistant disc, and Home.. 
Cons:. Lack of PS2 support but future firmware may fix that. Global Chat it seems like this is what most gamers want.. 
Summary:. This product is clearly the best choice if you're into hi-def entertainment. You will spend more money buying the 360 whether it's the arcade, pro, or elite. I have a 360 and it pales in what the PS3 offers. Microsoft do have Netflix and better online community and that's it. The PS3 is a solid console which offers more for your money than any other console. As of right now the PS3 offers a more robust exclusive lineup than Microsoft or Nintendo. More titles are beginning to show up on the PS3 including games that were once exclusives to Microsoft. Athough the online community may not be great, it is free of charge to you and is quickly catching up to MIcrosoft service.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Competitive price. 2. Bu-Ray player. 3. Built in Wi-fi. 4. free online multiplayer and PlayStation store. 5. Huge library of exclusive games. 6. HDMI port. 7. 120GB Hard Drive (+swapping it with a bigger HDD won't void warranty). 
Cons:. The only 2 cons that I could think of with the PS3 were. 1. High price. 2. Big physical size. 3. No PS2 backwards compatibility. But now with the slim, the first 2 issues have been alleviated.. 
Summary:. The PS3 has come a long way since it's launch. Not only has the price dropped yb a whopping $300 (to now only $299), But the library of quality games that it offers has also grown drastically. I would even argue that with the exception of Mass Effect, Halo3, and Gears of War, the PS3 has a better gaming library than its competitors.. With games like Killzone2, Metal Gear Solid 4, Uncharted 1&#38;2, LittleBigPlanet, Gran Turismo 5, God of War 3, Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare 2, GTA4, Fallout3, Bioshock, etc. You simply cannot go wrong.. Even the PlayStation Store has improved drastically. Even though it is still a bit behind Xbox LIVE in terms of the quality of service it offers, it's definitely catching up. and best of all, IT'S FREE!. Add to that the fact that it comes packed with a built in Wi-Fi adapter (you'll have to shell out another $100 to buy that separately on competing consoles), a fantastic build in Blu-Ray player, and a whopping 120GB HDD (which by the way is upgradable), the PS3 is a must-buy system for any gamer and tech enthusiast.. If you were on the fence about buying a PS3, now you have absolutely no excuse to hold back. Especially give the new low price point of $299..

Summary:. The Slim version is super cool..I already own the fat version....Planning to buy the new version as well.... Being the owner of Xbox 360 and PS3 I can honestly tell you that PS3 has a much better value for money than Xbox anyday even with with the unreduced cost($399)..... Now with the reduced cost you can't really beat this deal.... Here is my comparison between xbox 360 and PS3 for users who are still contemplating which console to buy.. 1.Failure rate in Xbox 360 is 35%.My Xbox 360 has failed on me twice already.On the other hand,my ps3 runs like rock and has no problems what so ever... 2.The Titles on the PS3 are way better than Xbox 360.Except for Halo and Gears of war the xbox has nothing...... 3.The PS3 can play any videos...Plug in ur external hard drive in the USB port and you are set..it pretty much plays all formats...For the Xbox to do this...You need to leave your PC on and it can't play all videos.. 4.The PS3 is Super Silent when it runs..You can hear the noise from Xbox 10 feet away... 5.The online gaming is free in PS3..You have to shell out 40 bucks every year in Xbox.... 6.The PS3 is the best blue ray player in the market... 7.The Wifi and the play and charge kit is built in PS3..You have to shell out over a 100 bucks to have this in Xbox..... 8.The power brick for the Xbox 360 is very clunky....the power brick is built in for PS3... Hope this helps.. 

$$;
Pros:. A Blu-Ray player and a game console for little more than the price of a BD player itself. Built in Wi-Fi. $299.00.. 
Cons:. HDMI cable is not included.. 
Summary:. Haven't been able to use one yet but I plan on purchasing one. Gave my Xbox, which I bought only because the Sony Playstation was so expensive, to my son and I miss it (I hope there's a steering wheel console available for this). I have a HD DVD player and I was looking to Blu-Ray since HD DVDs have fallen the way of Beta. The Sony PlayStation 3 Slim fills both my needs. Sweet news.. 

$$;
Pros:. BluRay player for $299= DEAL , Next Gen HD console with a cell processor powerful enough for &lt;a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/English/FAQ-PS3"&gt;molecular simulation&lt;/a&gt;, $299= STEAL. 
Cons:. Needs backward compatibility (firmware update can fix that), and enhanced online play (but it still beats paying $50 a year to play with other people). 
Summary:. BluRay player, next generation console, it's already double what its worth (and what other consoles go for). Also, everytime I use my ps3 (I already own a previous model) and I use the Folding@home project, I feel like I'm donating to cancer and Alzheimer's research.. "Starting in 2006, we began looking forward to another major advance in capabilities. This advance utilizes the new Cell processor in Sony's PLAYSTATION 3 (PS3) to achieve performance previously only possible on supercomputers. With this new technology (as well as new advances with GPUs), we will likely be able to attain performance on the 20 GigaFLOP scale per computer. With about 50,000 such machines, we would be able to achieve performance on the PetaFLOP scale. With software from Sony, the PlayStation 3 will contribute to the Folding@home project, pushing FAH another major step forward." - Pande lab Stanford University. .... Donate to the cause people! And play some great games while you're at it :).

Pros:. FREE online. Send pictures. PS Home. Internet browser. Rechargeable controller. 6-person video chat. Blu-Ray. Bluetooth. XMB. Free themes. Remote-play. Netflix. Quiet. SIXAXIS. Plays PS1 games. 3D games. Wi-Fi. 7-player. Ability to back-up. &#38; MORE!. 
Cons:. Not the best online interface, but still good (hey, its free). May freeze at times (not in game). The setup for switching from HDMI back to composite/component isn?t simple. Trigger buttons are mushy feeling. Initial loading/installing of games. 
Summary:. Well there are so many great things about the PS3, it comes at a compromise.. While the FREE ONLINE is great, it has its downfalls. Inviting people isn?t that simple. And the whole feature could use a little upgrade.. Messaging is good; because you can send pictures from your hard-drive along with it you can have a subject, and a body that can be quite long. Now wondering what use is sending pictures? Let?s say that you just won $500 from a scratch ticket, or that you saw Bigfoot swimming in your pool. Well more than likely people will probably be very skeptic of you. So being able to send a picture of bigfoot will show your friend you weren?t joking. But all that comes at the price that you can?t hit the PS button when the alert comes up that you got a message, and be able to bring it right up.. Playstation Home is like the best way to meet new people and find someone to play LittleBIGplanet with. It?s free and is full of little games. Be sure to see my review for it.. The PS Store is simple in the fact that there is only one type of currency, yours.(in my case its US Dollars) And you can easily pay for just what you are getting, and not be stuck with that 13� in your account. But that is only if you use a credit-card. But with the many cheap games called 'miniS' which are like Xbox arcade games, you can always find a game to play.. Status alerts are complete, by that i mean you are told who is online, and who is offline. When you get a message, trophy or chat invite. Even messages from a text chat room are shown. The nice thing is you are told when someone goes OFFline.. Facebook integration is full too! You can tell people what you just got from the PS store, and what trophy you just got.. The internet browser is very well done, with Flash 9 support, you can watch many online videos right on your PS3.. The controller is good, but the trigger buttons aren?t very responsive feeling. They are kinda mushy. But it?s great in the fact that you don?t need to go buy batteries or a special rechargeable pack. Plus with the SIXAXIS motion sensitivity, you can control games with more of a feel. Now when you?re playing those racing games and acting like the controller is a steering wheel, well NOW IT CAN!. Chat is good, but not great. You can do 6 person video/voice chat but you can?t be playing a game like you can in an Xbox live party. You can have text chats and those can be used during games.. Blu-Ray is great because its high definition, and large data capacity. But because of the type of disc, scratches can be a severe thing. What may not affect a regular disc could really mess up a blu-ray disc.. The Bluetooth allows for [almost] any wireless headset to be used to chat.. The many media formats allow for a variety of videos and music for playback. The ability to find a computer on the network is good for streaming things like pictures or video.. The XMB, or ?cross media bar? is the basic menu layout. It is fully customizable with themes and backgrounds.. Remote play allows accessing things like the internet or pictures on the PS3, and be viewed on the PSP.. Netflix is available to those who have it, and can request a disc so that you can use Netflix in the PS3 the same way it works on the Wii.. Now we?ve all heard of the Red ring of death?cause by the system overheating. Well the PS3?s fan is very good at dispersing the heat, but should it get hot, the power light will flash letting you know that it?s getting hot so you can save before you shut it off. It won?t turn on when it?s too hot, you will know it?s too hot because when you try to turn it on, the light will flash. This is telling you to either move it to a cool place so it can cool down or just give it a rest for a while (maybe it?s time to go outside and get some fresh air?).. Now the term ?slim? is because it?s smaller and quieter than the old PS3 which is nice because it is more efficient.. SIXAXIS motion sensitivity is a unique way to play certain games. In LittleBIGplanet, tilting the controller will move your head. In Motorstorm, you can have it be like Mariokart Wii and steer with it.. Updated. on Sep 22, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Design, Graphics, Sound, Features, Blu-Ray disc player.. 
Cons:. Lots of Glitches, no PS2 support.. 
Summary:. The PS3 slim is probably on the coolest systems out there with everything you need to have fun though it does have a lot of glitches and has no PS2 support but overall its awesome and in my opinion it better than the XboX 360.. 

$$;
Pros:. I've had my PS3 slim for 2 months now and I am completely sold on the device. It is hardly ever off and serves all my needs, even when not staring at the screen. I love it and am continuously surprised just how CHEAP it is when you consider all the. 
Cons:. There are plenty of games you must play in your life that are only available on this system: the thrill ride and top notch production of "Uncharted 2", the expansive and creative "LittleBigPlanet" and the EPIC "Metal Gear Solid 4".. - When you need. 

$$;
Pros:. dose not overheat and shut down and it loads without flaw. 
Cons:. does not play PlayStation 2 games. 
Summary:. with blue ray its well worth the price. 

$$;
Pros:. Games, price, design, HDMI 1.3, BLU-RAY,WI-FI,HDD,Netflix,Graphics. 
Cons:. backwards compatability, PSN store expensive. 
Summary:. The Wii or the XBOX have next to nothing left to brag about over the ps3. If you complain about games take another look because Uncharted, MGS4, LittleBigPlanet, The Show, and many more are great. This thing at 299 is like I said a great bargain. I paid 299 for a standalone Blu-Ray Player for my living room and it cannot match the ps3. Surround Sound is great something the XBOX or Wii can't do at 7.1 as well as the streaming options. Backwards Compatibility really isn't a big issue since 1 in 3 people have a ps3 and PSN store is something you can deal with. Simply the Best.. Updated. on Mar 12, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. built in Wi-Fi,Blu-ray,more features,very good graphics and best Blu-ray player. More slimmer design. More compatible features and also built in bluetooth. Free online services. 
Cons:. not good online services, half the number of games than xbox 360.. 
Summary:. good console to buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wi-Fi, Xbox appears cheaper, but with add-ons , Xbox ends up more expensive, for a comparable console but no Blu-ray. Live is better, but I would rather save the 50 bucks. PS3 sleek and modern, Xbox 360 like an amoeba.. 
Cons:. Cons:. 1. Controller - still prefer Xbox's, but a pretty minor issue IMO.. 2. online gaming still not as well-developed as Xbox Live.. 5. A lot of games available on both consoles look noticeably better on 360. Why?. 4, No Halo - I love Halo.. 
Summary:. I bought an Xbox 360 in 2007, when I believed it was the best value on the market (and I still believe it was at the time). That said, have now bought a PS3 slim as the low price and massive improvement in game quality has now brought the two systems more or less on par IMO. I'd actually say that at this particular moment in time, it appears the PS3 gives you better value than a 360. Still, until Sony brings a franchise as good as Halo to the market, cannot quite give them the edge.. 

$$;
Pros:. built in bluray player. excellent speed loading bluray movies. wifi for bd-live. amazing gaming graphics. photo, video, and music can by viewed/ played from hard drive. 
Cons:. uglier design than old version (at least i think so). heats up when enclosed in small space. controller awkward for bluray playback controls. 
Summary:. get a fast bluray player, great game system and media center for the same price as a regular bluray player thats much slower.. 

$$;
Pros:. WiFi. media server. blue tooth. free interenet(includes online game play). blue ray player. 
Cons:. non because i also have a ps2.....but its just collecting dust.... and i hate that there coming out with more gb slim ps3 for $50 more...in a month or so.... 
Summary:. buy it if you dont want to deal with xbox360 headaces ... plus it has alot of room to grow.... im giving this a 4.5 rating to give room for future ratings.... 

$$;
Pros:. Slim design. Fantastic Blu-Ray Player. Umm...finally has a variety of good games?! Built-in WiFi (XBOX IS A JOKE!) Better value than XBOX at $299.. 
Cons:. Not as attractive as older model. No PS2 support. Only 2 USB inputs. Netflix? Online not as comprehensive as XBOX Live. XBOX is a better media streamer (IMO). 
Summary:. $299 is a fantastic price point for this device, which has movies, music, games, and other media covered in a slimmer, albeit less attractive, little black box.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact quiet and easy to move. Much better price!. Awesome system with lots of fun games. Blu-ray movies and rentals off the same system. loads of add on content online for various games. A fair amount of customization options for the UI. 
Cons:. Not backwards compatible with PS2.... While $300 is a good price its now on average with other consoles. Games still typically go for 50-60 dollars per. only two USB ports. 
Summary:. My first console since the PS1 and i'm loving everything it has to offer. Overall a great system with plenty of media functionality. Unfortunatly I feel the Sony is really missing out on potential customers who wish to upgrade from their PS2's to the PS3 since its not backwards compatible. Sure you can still play your PS2 games on your PS2 still but its the convience of being able to play all your games on one system that makes all the difference. Besides lots of people if they were thinking about getting a PS3 would trade-in the PS2 for a mark off the PS3 price.. 

$$;
Pros:. $299, super quiet, failure rate is &lt;1%, hadn't had any problems yet, must have with all its great exclusives, free online service but isn't that advanced than Live. 
Cons:. no IR port, no Ps2 backwards compatibility, XMB is a little slow to load, no in game chat with friends. 
Summary:. You all should buy a 'slim' before the new games come out! Some good exclusives coming this 2009 holiday are: Uncharted 2, Modern Warfare 2, Tekken 6, God of War 3, Assassins Creed 2, MAG, Final Fantasy XIII, Modnation Racers, Gran Tursimo 5 and Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2. There are so many good games that are out but There isn't enough space to write them out.. Bottom-line is you should get this game over a 360. You get much more than what you get for a 360. User upgradeable hard drive, The best exclusives out there, Blu-Ray Player, 1080i gaming, Built-in WiFi and so much more. All the pros overcome the little cons that can be solved. Want to play Ps2 games? Buy a Ps2. want to use a universal remote? Logitech has a adapter to convert it to IR signals. In game chat and speeding up the XMB can be upgraded with a software upgrade coming soon so just wait.. The 360's Cons are cons you cant really fix and IMO the PS3 kills the 360 with all its stunning features.. Well I hope you all buy one if you havn't already!!! YOU WONT REGRET IT =]. 

$$;
Pros:. Low failure rate as opposed to XBOX 360's approximately 52% failure rate ps3 about 10-15%. Free network.. One of the best options for a blu ray player. Much lighter! Easy to travel with. Internal power source no more heavy bricks!. 
Cons:. Network interface isn't quite there yet.. Not many new features added to it's older forms. less usb ports. Blur ray is widely believed to be a rather useless invention. No backwards compatability with ps2. 
Summary:. It is indeed a fact that ps3's failure rate is far lower than xbox. With it's price of 299.99 it's pretty easy to pick up, especially if you give up your ps2 stuff which you won't be needing anyways.. Sure the network isn't as developed as Xbox but really how can you beat free? In these times anything that's free and is decent is a godsend. Really though there's not much to complain about unless you nitpick. The argument that the xbox has slightly better developed network is rather silly.. If you still think blu-ray is useless, it's probably cause as of late people including myself have not been able to afford this enhancement. It really is better, unlike with old cd's like my ps2 ones who were damaged simply by wear and tear damage, my ps3 blu ray games have not even been scratched or marked after a week of use, my ps2 discs would have already had some kind of mark. So i recommend you make the jump to blu-ray format games by purchasing the ps3 slim.. Backwards compatibility is a widely complained about problem, i also didn't like this idea but once i jumped into the enhanced graphics of the ps3 i didn't want to go back, you won't either, leave last-gen behind and join the rest of us guys, if you're considering selling your ps2 and it's stuff to get a ps3 slim DO IT you will NOT regret it.. The internal power source, many people think of this as a silly argument, but when you travel and want to bring your system, you only have to worry about one thin, you dont have to worry about your adapter getting smashed or stolen, or god help you if you forget it, of course it also adds a bit of weight to your bag. Controllers-A LOT of people love to attack this area. Lets dive right in, anyone who can use a screw driver will realize that you can replace the battery in the controller, the battery life is also quite long as opposed to having to buy batteries all the time, if you had a gameboy color back in the day you know what a pain in the ass it was to replace batteries all the time and with all the money spent on batteries, i could have bought two or three next gen game systems. If i am wrong than my argument still stands, 10 dollars a month for batteries adds up to a LOT more than 50 every two years or so for a new controller.. Do the math you'll be spending around 240 dollars for batteries after two years having to replace batteries while a simple 50 dollars will give a ps3 owner a new controller.. I tried to be fair up there but here i have one last argument, and it is rather silly but i really think this kicks ps3 up a notch. God of war III.. One of the ps2's top titles will be making its sequel on ps3 only. A heavy reason ps3 was lagging was cause of lack of good exclusives, once this game comes out i'm quite sure it's going to at least get a lot of people thinking.. Again so what if your online is slightly better? Another explanation you will fins interesting.. (Strictly added as OPINION just take a minute to think about it). Online shooters which is what most xbox people play is really something that started on the pc. Do i really need to move beyond the classic Quake 3 which set up the rest of the shooters? I think not. Many of you think that's biased but so are many of your arguments about online. If you don't know what quake 3 is you probably think Halo is a revolutionary game and you should probably look into it before you make posts about consoles.. xbox DOES have slightly better online interface. However when you get down to it, PSN serves it's purpose. It delivers a top notch blu ray player and soon one of the most popular games from last gen will be making its sequels debut on ps3.. Xbox delivers slightly better interface. However this comes at a price as does the wifi adapter 100 dollars. With the ps3? FREE absolutely FREE.. To give an example that's like saying. a pizza restaurant is GIVING out a free pizza with a 20 dollar large two topping pizza. (Ps3). While another is giving out a pizza yes but the pizza you must purchase to get the second one free is 50 dollars for the same amount of toppings. (Xbox 360). The second pizza represents the price of the console for the ps3 and the free represents the network while the xbox's free represents how much better its online is while its 50 dollar pizza represents how much you have to pay for it later.. So why wouldn't you get the free and 20 dollar?. Saying it's better is strictly opinion going back to pizza i like papa johns, other people think it tastes like puke.. In short, ps3 is cheaper since it's network is FREE, has a blu ray player and need i bring the slogan in? Ps3 "Only does everything" The only thing it dosen't do is feed you.. oh wait i can order papa johns from it too. Okay it does do everything you could possibly want. Many people nitpick to find fault. Focus on the substantial issues, slightly less developed network is not substantial, the money it costs IS, and with xbox you end up paying a lot more for less.

Pros:. 1) Great Exclusives. 2) Blu Ray. 3) Built in WiFi. 4) Free Online. 5) 120GB HD. 8) Matte Finish (No fingerprints!). 6) PSN Store. 7) $299 price tag. 
Cons:. 1) Small Game selection compared to 360. 2) Not as developed PSN as Live.. 3) No movie subscription service.. 
Summary:. This is an amazing PS3. I don't think what people realized what is in this system. There is an 8 Core Processor, Killzone only used 2.5 cores, the PS3 has plenty of room to grow. They fixed the power issues and uses almost no power. Built in Wi-Fi and a Blu Ray player(Still on of the fastest and best in the market for BD Players). The PSN Store has PSone games and PSP games to download. They don't have as big of a selection as Xbox but they are getting more Exculsives (inFamous, Killzone 2, Resistance 2, MGS4, and soon God of War 3). Everything that isn't as stong, Sony has been working on. Defiantly worth the month. Its the best all around game system for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Durability, plays DVD's and Blu Ray DVD's, controllers do not require batteries, very sleek and quiet machine, game catelogue, FREE ONLINE PLAY!! - with built-in wireless adapter.. 
Cons:. The PS3 Slim (And most PS3's) do not play Playstation 2 games, this was a bit upsetting but all I did was hold onto my PS2.. 
Summary:. I bought an Xbox 360 about a year ago, it broke 3 times. It is advertised $100 cheaper but that doesn't factor in the Xbox Live payments (Online play) and the $100 wireless adapter. I was sick of putting money into a console that doesn't work. The myth out there that PS3's online play and game catalogue is inferior it just that, it is a myth. Since selling my Xbox and buying a PS3 I am a happy customer. It has everything the Xbox has + durability, free online play, and a blu-ray player.. Bottome-line, PS3 Slim and its competitive price blow it's competition out of the water.. 

$$;
Pros:. + $299 pricepoint. + more energy efficent. + one of the best Blu-Ray players. + free PSN. + controller has li-on batteries. + wifi built in. + great media player. + outstanding build quality - http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/PlayStation-3-Slim/1121/1. 
Cons:. - lack of IR port (pretty weird considering this is one of the best Blu-Ray players on the market). - no Netflix support out of the box, although you can use a transcoding program called PlayOn on your PC/Mac to fix this. 
Summary:. At $299 the PS3 is an amazing deal if you're in the market for a current gen console. You get free online gameplay, a Blu Ray player, wifi, and li-on batteries in the controllers, and the ability to upgrade the HDD. On top of this Sony has the best exclusives coming out in the next 12 months. Gran Turismo 5, Uncharted II, Heavy Rain, Ratchet &#38; Clank Future: ACiT, MAG, God of War III, Agent, The Last Guardian. Seriously - compare this with the Xbox 360 where you have Forza 3 and Halo: ODST as the big exclusives for the next 12 months.. The Xbox 360 is over priced. $100 for wifi. $50/yr for online gameplay, $15 for a rechargable battery kit, and then the overpriced HDD kit that they release at $100 and 180 every few years. On top of all of that once the warranty is out and Microsoft wont repair your console for free you will have to pony up the $200 for an arcade system or all your games and controllers will become worthless. Every single person I know who owns a 360 has had to send it in to MIcrosoft at least one time.. In my humble opinion you would have to be out of your mind to buy a Xbox 360 over a PS3 unless ALL of your friends are on the 360 and you have no interest in Blu Ray.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Energy Efficient. -Whisper Quiet. -free online play. -built in wifi. -rechargeable controllers. -low cost hard drive upgrade. -durable bluray disk. -Extensive library of games/ps3 exclusives. -Web Brower (facebook, twitter, youtube, etc.). 
Cons:. -most multi plat games are PORTED to ps3 so graphics and loading times suffer slightly. -game installation. -No hdmi cable included. 
Summary:. ps3 slim and 360 elite are both priced at 299.99, but the better value is with the ps3 because of the extra features it comes with, that would cost you at least two hundred more dollars for the 360 to have (wifi, rechargeable controllers, online gaming, etc). In survey conducted by GAMEINFORMER magazine in the august 2009 issue, over 50% of 360's will fail on you while the ps3 is at a mere 13%. The ps3 also now has something that it didn't have before, and that's a reputable amount of games, that are also on the 360 like (Call of Duty, Bioshock, etc.) as well as their own exclusives most of which are considered by many reviewing websites to be editors choices (little big planet, metal gear solid 4, infamous, killzone 2) and the exclusives list will actually keep building with future releases of God of War III and Heavy Rain to name a couple. Although Bluray is fairly new it did win the format war and is projected to be the future of multimedia disk, you have to admit that being able to watch high def movies, granted that you have an HDTV, is an awesome feature to have at your disposal. Transfering media to your ps3 is also very easy, as you can put media on a flash drive and the ps3 can copy it and put it in the appropriate category (music, video, pics). Overall, you get more bang for your buck with a much more reliable system.. 

$$;
Pros:. The downgrade in price and the hike in Gbs is great. I found that the slim ps2 wasnt truly slim with the flip top design u couldnt fit it in a tighter spot, u wouldnt be able to get the game in. the ps3 keeps the same design just compacted.. 
Cons:. Something not mentioned so far is the buttons. I liked the touch pad on the fat ps3. and the ever popular no b/c, but the only reason is for god of war. playstation network could fix that by making it a download.. 
Summary:. Overall with the space and energy saving this system is better than the old fat version. Sure u can whine that 'the piano black finish is gone' but i dont judge a system on looks who cares about the look, games such as littlebigplanet, god of war 3, killzone 2, heavenly sword and infamous arent known because the system looks good. I've owned all three consoles on the market now, the wii the 20gb xbox 360 and the 40 gb ps3, just yesterday i sold my 80 gb for the new slim. When u can sell a system and get the next thing out there without spending a cent thats great, I walked away from that with with 60 bucks in my pocket.. 

$$;
Pros:. I own all the 'next-gen' systems, and in my view the PS3 is the best on the market for the money. The PS3 is best Blu-ray player on the market, has built-in WiFi, free on-line play, runs silently, and has a great collection of must-have games.. 
Cons:. There is no backwards compatibility with the PS2 library. But honestly, now that we've made the leap to 'next-gen' HD gaming, I find it hard to go back and play the older games. Still, it would be nice to have the option.. 
Summary:. If you're on the fence between the 360 and the PS3, you should seriously consider the PS3 -- esp. if you have an HDTV. With the PS3, you get the best Blu-ray player on the market built-in, pay no additional money for Wi-Fi connectivity or online gaming, and have access to hundreds of must-have next-gen games (including those that are only available on the PS3 e.g. Resistance 1 &#38; 2, Killzone 2, Uncharted 1 &#38; 2, Metal Gear 4, Ratchet &#38; Clank, Little Big Planet, inFamous, and, soon, God of War 3 and Gran Turismo 5). The XBox 360 is an excellent system as well, complete with its own must-have exclusive games (Gears of War, Halo, Mass Effect), but be prepared to be soaked in hidden costs. The 360 WiFi adapter (which is basically essential) will cost you a whopping $100 extra, the rechargeable battery packs for the controllers are $12.99 each, and XBox Live online-gaming is $50 per year! Also keep in mind that the 360 cannot play Blu-ray movies -- only traditional DVDs. So, all-in-all, the PS3 is the clear winner for the money in my opinion.. 

$$;
Pros:. the energy saving and and the size and weight is less also im liking the new "slim" price tag. 
Cons:. not much difference in the hardware, only 2 usb's again,removed the power switch, removed the "other OS" feature and could have done a better design. 
Summary:. ps3 slim is great im getting one my self but sony could of at least sent out a survey or something to get better ideas, they should of put extra usb ports and should of put ps2 backwards compatibility, i give this one a 4.5/5, SONY PLEASE LISTEN AND PUT EXTRA USB'S AND PUT BACK THE POWER SWITCH ON THE BACK..

Pros:. The price is unbelievable.. 
Cons:. I really don't know. 
Summary:. This is an absolute steal. Can't wait.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Blu-Ray player, smaller and lighter design than the first generation, wireless controller with great battery life, black matte finish, decent video upscaling and great interface specially for mutimedia functionality.. 
Cons:. Runs hot, hard drive capacity not enough if used for multimedia, no HDMI cable included, no vertical stand included, no external hard drive support, can only support FAT32 file format and cannot install additional codec support.. 
Summary:. First of all I'm just a casual gamer, I only play the games at easy/casual mode and sometimes I even use cheats to play the game a lot easier and not waste to much time playing the game. I am more focused on using the multimedia capabilities of the PS3.. The PS3 is actually one of the cheapest Blu-Ray player out there, if you are planning to own one you may want to look at this device which also counts as a gaming console with mutimedia and internet capabilities. The PS3 slim, if compared to the first generation PS3 is lighter and smaller, also less prone to scratches and smudges which will make your console look dirty and old. PS3's video upscaling is decent, for DVD's and uploaded videos even at 480p. The interface of PS3 is nice and neat similar to PSP's interface.. On the downside, the PS3 runs quite hot after an hour or so, unless you are in a cold environment I think that the PS3 should be positioned vertically so that the would dissipate faster. Because mine is sitting on a wooden table at normal position with no obstructions at all sides, and when I am playing a game for more than 2 hours the system is already quite hot. I bought my PS3 with a 120 gigabytes of hard drive space (actually it is less than 120GB since it will be formatted), for gaming I think that it is already sufficient enough but if you plan on using it as a multimedia hub the hard drive space may be short. It would no longer an issue if only the PS3 can support external hard disk at NTFS format or its MAC counterpart, so that you will no longer need to worry about the system hard drive space. Another thing I noticed is that, the PS3 system does not support some of the file formats, I have no problem with audio since most of it is in MP3 and AAC, the problem is in video file format because even some MP4, WMA and AVI files won't play correctly. I also have several MKV video files and it is painstaking to convert them all to MP4 (PS3) format without having loss of quality. It would also be a great addition to the PS3 bundle if it has an HDMI cable and vertical stand included, but not really a big deal for me.. I am actually having second thoughts if I were to buy this console since I am just a casual gamer and I own a personal computer with decent gaming capabilities. Gaming on a PC, in my own personal opinion (somebody might react that the PC is the better gaming machine), is a bit expensive because you will need to upgrade every now and then, and tiresome because you will always configure your PC for every game to make sure it will run a optimal condition. Another device that I am considering, based on the multimedia functionality is the Apple Mac Mini, but this thing does have a Blu-Ray player and is quite expensive compared to the PS3 (more twice the price of the PS3) though the Apple Mac Mini has external hard drive support, can be installed with 3rd party codecs, has a nice multimedia interface and a remote. But in the end I still chose the PS3 for its versatility, even with its shortcomings, I hope that Sony will address this some of the PS3's problems. So there you have it, my own personal view of the PS3 slim, I hope that I may be of help to those potential buyers of the PS3 slim. Thank you for reading.... 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek, slim design. The best system for Mature gamers. Free online game play. Superior Graphic capabilities. Functions as DVD player, Computer, Game System, just about anything. Low price(now equal to the Xbox 360 slim). 
Cons:. Less developed online community. Inferior game selection. Not enough multiplayer games. Tends to lack diversity in audience target. Not backwards compatible. Controllers less streamlines than Xbox 360 or Wii. 
Summary:. I love the PS3, it is a great system to do just about anything on. Blu-ray is amazing on it, as well as the single player games. Graphically superior to both Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii, the PS3 now has the price to compete with the Xbox.. However, I still enjoy the online play of the Xbox much better, even if you do have to pay for it. The online community of the PS3 is lacking at best. The sheer number of games in the Xbox selection far outweighs any graphic advantage the PS3 possesses. In the end, it really depends on what kind of gamer you are. If you enjoy in-depth story-line, deeply gratifying and sexy graphics, and a focus on mature gaming, buy a PS3. If you enjoy multiplayer and games in just about any genre you can think of, Xbox 360 is your system. And of course, if enjoy super-titles and a focus on cartoon graphics and children's games, then go with a Wii..

Pros:. 1 Normal powercord. 2. Quiter than the 360. 3. built in wifi is a pro and a con. No upgrade to N is possible. 4. Blu Ray is a huge plus - the only reason I bought it honestly. 
Cons:. 1. Controller sucks compared to the 360 - no removable batteries, too small, no KB, no headset to the controller. 2. PS console menu / online sucks compared to the 360's Xbox Live.. 3. All hardware is more expensive than the 360 equivelent. 
Summary:. I only bought the PS3 because I viewed it as a Blu Ray player with benefits. For that it is fine. As a game console, I feel the 360 with Xbox Live is better, and the hardware for Xbox is cheaper overall. I have not played any online games with the PS3 yet, but so far the gaming online experience is disappointing (but it is free). As an Xbox 360 user, I miss my free headset so chat it up with friends, and navigating on Xbox Live is much better. If I compared the quality of the hardware consoles, I would give the edge to PS3, but the Xbox is much more fun and easier to hook up with my friends online.. 

$$;
Pros:. The size and what it does. 
Cons:. controllers could be bigger. 
Summary:. I am 55 years old. I had all the old 70's &#38; 80's game consoles. Then I switched to the computer to play games. I figured I was to old to play Xbox and &#38; PS, Plus I could not justify the added cost. My daughter hooked me up with her PS3 last month and since then I have been learning the games, reading my laptop files, watching Blue-ray and Netflix movies. This machine is amazing. My wife has picked one up for Xmas for me. I moved my year old Blue-ray player upstairs. As everyone knows the picture &#38; sound is amazing. Watching netflix is very easy to use. The movies look great and load fast. For #299 this is a bargin. Best bang for my dollar. I stopped in Sam's club &#38; played with a Xbox and that was amazing also. The controller was a lot better than the PS3. The biggest seller for me is the Blue-ray and Netflix movies.. 

$$;
Pros:. New slimmer model. Energy efficiency better than the past. Lightweight and more compact. Good price for current economy.. 
Cons:. Backwards compatability phased out. Limited on accesories (including universal remotes). Removal of OS installation.. 
Summary:. The new PS3 Slim is a console created to fit the people of a run-down economy. Yes, they have taken away a few features with its creation (some will be missed more than others), but in all was a smart move for Sony. First it seems the Slim is trying to go Green with its energy efficiency compaired to the older models, and its cheaper price (compared to its first system for $700), it has become much more affordable. The system is selling for $299, which includes WIFI, Blue ray player (on average $120 inexpenive), gaming console, internet browser, and media center. With the removal of its ability to install a Linux OS, plus removing the backwards compatability, it has made the system a bit more affordable, with lots of space to give everyone to play those upcoming titles that will be coming out soon.. I agree, some of the features it has removed, or never had would be a great addition to this energy saver, but if you are looking for something to game with, watch blue-ray movies, and have a media center to hold your music, pictures, and free online gameplay, this is the console for you. Times are hard, people have to make sacrifices, and Sony has definately made some hard desicions and sacraficed some of the great things people liked about the PS3, but has come out with a great simple gaming system people can enjoy, and afford!

$$;
Pros:. Great graphics, amazing excluesives, love new slimmer look and design,motions controls coming up look awesome, man that price.... though my wallet was lighter, i still had enough to take the bus home. Plus free playstation network.. 
Cons:. prefer the xbox controller, Halo and gears would be nice, all my friends have 360s.. 
Summary:. Screw 360, 2009 is the year of the PS3. 

$$;
Pros:. Smaller than regular PS3, Great graphics, love the Blu-Ray Player,. 
Cons:. Online system still is horrible I'm always lagging, takes forever to download and install demos sometimes 3 times as long as the same demo on a 360, constant updates to firmware take forever. 
Summary:. I had all three systems until i gave up the Wii in a divorce, but I have to say that I spend most of my time on the 360 and PS3. I really like the exclusives on both systems but when a games comes out that's on both of them I prefer the 360 version. This is mainly because the online system is still lacking so much on the PS3, using the same exact high speed internet connection my experience is 100 times better on my 360 then the PS3. However I still love games like Drake's Uncharted and MGS4, and I love the Blu-Ray movies so the PS3 is worth the money I've spent on it.. I'd like to point out the CNET really needs to spend some quality time reviewing products, or maybe they are getting a cut from Sony for pitching their $24 vertical stand! I say this because right out of the box my Slim PS3 stands vertically on it's own, it's not unstable or in danger of tipping over.. Overall I'm really happy with this update to the PS3, the fan is so quiet now!. 

$$;
Pros:. Slimmer. Energy efficient. 
Cons:. Could use more USB ports. Not all contries in PSN list.. 
Summary:. You can reproduce Blu-ray disc, DVD, MP3s, Play Video games, Manage photos/albums, connect to the internet, download videos, etc. all in the same device.. Some people do not like Playstation?s games option but to be honest I think there are a vast catalog of games available out there no mention excusive games such as Little Big Planet.. As someone who not only for a video game console but also for a media center PS3 is the one to pick, and now, with this slimmer version no reason to look any other way.. When registering to the PSN sadly there are a few countries in the list so you have to pick the more convenience and this in the future could give some issues when buying from PSN store, this is the reason I didn?t give the 5 stars.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks, setup, games (Grand Turismo 5 Prologue), BlueRay player (Loads pretty fast, too), great sound, quiet operation, nice rumble with the Dualshock wireless controller.. 
Cons:. No HDMI cable included. The on-screen keyboard and on-screen BlueRay player keys are awkward to turn-on and use. Internet Browser also awkard. No Netflixs. Life with PlayStation is a waste of time. Downloading data is slow on Playstation Network.. 
Summary:. I like it! My first game console! I wish the gamepad had tilt control within games (like the Wii). I added a 10 foot (Monoprice) USB cable for the so I could easily use the unit when the wireless control pad was being charge. The USB ports are powered down when the unit is off so you might need to charge your wireless controller(s) via a computer.. Can't play your iTunes/media without 3rd party software on your Mac or PC. (I found this out using Google since it wasn't mentioned in the PS3's setup. The PS3 couldn't find any media servers.. Being a newbie, I often wasn't sure when I should press the triangle or square keys in the different Playstation XMB menus.. All in all a great game machine for little more than the current cost of a BlueRay player.. 

$$;
Pros:. This product is slim, and looks very sleek. It runs smoothly and all... The disk times are good and the system seems to operate very well for how small it is. 
Cons:. what bothers me is that ps4insider.net and other sites have already said this is NOT the next generation of console that Sony is making!. 
Summary:. It is not the ps3.5!! There is no such thing and there will not be! We are waiting for the PS4 that will be capable of playing the top of the line games in 2013 or so.. Just like we waited it out for the PS3 to arrive. Sony and Microsoft both want to increase the shelf-life of their systems and this is one of the ways they are doing it... 

$$;
Pros:. I love that it uses less power, so much more quiet and the only heat is from the back (not as much as the older model) and a lot less.. 
Cons:. I was unhappy to find out that it does not play SACD discs. I can live without playing PS2 games, but not being able to play SACD discs is a real downer.. 
Summary:. I love the lower price and the smaller size and it plays my CDs and DVD+ and - discs fine. I have sold my older PS3 for $200. The PS3 Slim only costs me $100 + tax. Thanks Sony!. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in wi-fi, Blueray disc, smaller size, lighter weight, less energy consumption and a $300 price tag.. 
Cons:. No HDMI cable included. New color and logo. Only two usb ports instead of four. No card reader.. 
Summary:. Overall looks like this is going to be a great system for the price. I think the price range is about where it should be. I am not a hard core gamer and even though I do own the PS3 80GB model and am very happy with it, it was very hard for me to come up with the $600 to buy it, let alone sell my wife on it. We do watch BD movies on it but I rent them from Blockbuster because I believe they are too expensive to buy. The picture quality is better but to me not enough difference to justify the price. The other good thing with the PS3 is that it up converts the picture on regular DVD's. I really like the smaller size and weight, it will be a lot easier to take with you if you travel or want to take it to a friends house. I think the old system looks a lot better as far as color and logo but I can see that the finish on the PS3 SLIM won't attract as many fingerprints. I do wish they would have stuck to the same logo though. Maybe SONY can offer some skins with different logos and colors. It would also be nice if they included a HDMI cable. I have picked up a RCA 9ft HDMI cable for $10 so it would at least be nice if SONY could lower their prices on theirs. I have been hearing about the bad customer service reputation that Sony has but I have not had to use it personally. I have had my system for about a year and have had no problems with it. I also like the free Playstation network. I have played against friends online and have had mo problems. I also download demos to try out games to see if I would like to buy them. I do wish that there where more titles of games to choose from but from what I hear developers are starting to catch on to programing for the cell processor and more titles are being added all of the time. Sony should invest more money and resources to game development to try and get more exclusive games like INFAMOUS on the shelfs. That is an awesome game.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Price. 2. Not MICROSOFT!!!. 3. Great games...exclusives or not.. 4. Not MICROSOFT!!!. 5. BluRay movies rock.. 6. Not MICROSOFT!!!. 7. Free online play.. 
Cons:. 1. $300 is still a lot of money.. 2. Online lag time still an issue, getting better...but still sucks.. 
Summary:. Not owned by a huge, mega software company that makes me get permission every time I want to do something...Sony has been in the video and entertainment industry for a LONG time. I bought my PS1 in 1996 when Sega went in the toilet. Just gave it away last month. Didn't buy a PS2, too busy chasing girls to spend time cooped up. Bought my PS3 a year and 1/2 ago. No problems other than lack of sleep...thanks Oblivion, GTA4, COD4..

Pros:. price, size, 120gb size.

$$;
Pros:. Swapping out hard drives is easy as pie ?takes upward of 60 seconds. The Blu-ray is stunning and really the combo of game/blu-ray player make this thing unbeatable. And remember, this thing is 1080P not 720 like Xbox.. 
Cons:. The Xbox has a better user interface but that only matters to hardcore gamers and it is software ?meaning PS3 could get better as it already has with updates.. 
Summary:. Off point but... My son is on his third Xbox, the other two crapped out... and worse, dealing with Microsoft customer service was like pushing a dead elephant uphill. You would think with the tens of thousands of returns they have that they would have that down ?they don't. Seriously, I cannot imagine why anyone would buy an Xbox with their 54% failure rate yet they do.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not a space heater powered by a leaf blower.. 
Cons:. I already have the original noisy space heater.. 
Summary:. This is great news if you don't have one already. Unfortunately, I got one a while back. I remember reading all of those xBox 360 horror stories about the RROD and how it overheats and how it sounds like a leaf blowing space heater. So I waited for the Falcon 360 to hit the market.. For some unknown reason, I have never seen anyone post a complaint about the early PS3's noisy space heating capabilities??? When it is worse than the original 360 ever was! It needs to be housed in one of those "meat cooler" rooms that they used to keep the old skool refrigerator sized computers in, not in the small a/v component shelves under a flat panel TV.. I guess I am the only nonfanboy to buy one thusfar???. Updated. on Aug 21, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. True hi-def experience, not all top tier titles are just 1st and 3rd person shooters, no subs. fee for online. For what you get, clobbers Wii and Xbox now. Large HD for jukebox experience. Blu-ray = no disc swaps.. 
Cons:. If you don't have a PS2 and want to play those titles, too bad. That's a $100 option as a PS2 slim. As a media player, it lacks polish.. 
Summary:. If you want to play Halo, then get a 360, then get one again because its going to break down. If you want to play great modern games on a solid machine in HD - get the PS3.. 

$$;
Pros:. 2.0 Blu-Ray player, NetFlix instant access, amazing games, fantastic sound decoding for those of us with older AV recievers, simple controls.... 
Cons:. No remote control IR port, less than sparkling on-line experience. 
Summary:. I bought a PS3 about three weeks ago and I love it. I am not normally a video game enthusiast (this is my first console) but when CNET spoke so highly of the Blu-Ray experience gotten from this system I decided to check it out. I was not disappointed. I don't know how Sony is advertising this system (I don't have TV through cable or sattelite...I watch all the programs I want online) but if they are not calling it a media center they are missing the boat. This thing is amazing! I immediately sent off for the NetFlix instant access disc (which they sent me in one day) and I have seen numerous movies and TV shows through this network. Once or twice I have seen pixel breakdown while watching something from NetFlix but it always cleared up in a few seconds and was most likely my internet hookup and not the network. There is a reason NetFlix is driving Blockbuster out of business. Their network is extremely handy...a few more titles available for instant download would be nice but I am sure they are working on this.. Now for the Blu-Ray. The picture is great and the sound is glorious! I was watching a BD of "The Omen" the other night and I couldn;t help but think i was probably seeing and hearing the movie better than they did in 1976 in the theater! The only problems I have with the experience stem not from the PS3 but from the Blu-Ray format itself. But I won't bore you with that here. Suffice it to say, Blu-Ray's look and sound amazing and so do standard DVD's. That's right, standard DVD's look better when played on this system. I'm sure this soes not come as news to those of you familiar with the format and it's features but for those looking to buy a Blu-Ray player...it will upscale your standard DVD's (although letterboxed) and keep you from having to run out to Best buy and replace all of your discs.. I can't, in good conscience, review it's abilities as a game system because I am not a true gamer. I have three games...Baseball, Football, and Hockey...and when I get over how UNBELIEVABLE graphics are now compared to those seen on my high school buddie's Atari system then maybe I will be able to lend my two cents to it's video game abilities. I do love the Baseball, however.. By the way, some people have complained about the heat this system produces. Originally I had the console in my entertainment center and the heat was a bit startling. However, i have since moved it to the top shelf, so the system is out in the open and i have had no further heat difficulties and the built-in fan is almost silent. Not the case with my friend's XBox.. 

$$;
Pros:. Smaller and cheaper. 
Cons:. Controllers cost too much. Online still far behind xbox live. Controller too small. Smaller CHEAP games library. 
Summary:. While this is an improvement on the PS3 fat it still lags behind the 360 as a gaming console. The controller is simply too small for comfort after anything over an hour and no party chat. It wouldn't be such a problem if the online had more features (party chat, better support and playerbase) it might be worth $500Au.. Until then the 360 is the better gaming console.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD, easy to use, shiny?. 
Cons:. Online gaming on consoles continues to lack, joysticks (eww), no modding allowed. 
Summary:. The PS3 is certainly the best console one can hope for given more robust components than its competitors. Thats said, they all are trumped by a PC gaming rig... yea a gaming pc will cost you more, but it's soooo much more immersive. Argue if you must, but PS3 and Xbox don't come with options. What you get is what you get, and if you're ok with that then by all means live it up. But if you want the most out of your games and the highest level of diversity and capability, buck up and enter the PC realm where the real magic is. If you haven't been living in a cave I'm sure you've noticed consoles are becoming more and more like a gaming PC with every new generation. You realize every game made for a console was developed on a PC right? So i ask you: why not just skip ahead? Stop letting them drip feed you a constant tease and go for the gusto, gaming PC! Republic of gamers unite!. 

$$;
Pros:. -Bluray Capable. -Size. -Graphics. -WiFi. 
Cons:. -Game Selection. -Online Play is Mediocre. -Sony CD/DVD/Bluray drives don't last long. -Bluetooth connectivity for remotes limits universal remote controls. 
Summary:. I have both the PS3 Slim 250GB and an Xbox 360 Elite. The system I play more often than not is the Xbox 360. Why? Game selection, quality of games, and online play.. I like sports games, which are typically available on both systems. The majority of EA and even 2K titles are ported from the 360 to the PS3 and the quality is evident. PS3 games appear choppy, less refined, screen tear is prominent in many ported games, and overall the experience is poor. The Xbox experience is just more natural, better, and refined.. I bought the PS3 for the Bluray player and some of the exclusives; Metal Gear Solid 4, Gran Turismo 5, and eventually God of War. Unfortunately, I have found that Gran Turismo 5 has been delayed over and over, and who knows when it will be released. God of War looks okay, but nothing jaw dropping, and now Xbox is going to have Metal Gear Solid. The one game I highly recommend for any sports fan that has a PS3 is MLB 09: The Show; fantastic game, hands down.. The other area of disappointment is online play as well as version updating. With online play, you truly get what you pay for. It is free, which is a plus, but I don?t know how many times I have been disconnected from the server during a game; it?s like I am talking on AT&#38;T with dropped calls only it?s dropped from the server! It is free so I don?t complain too much, but it is WAY behind the Xbox 360.. I also don?t know how many times I have thrown in a new game and come to find out I need to upgrade the System Software which can take 20 minutes or I need to download a newer version of the game which can take as much time as well. Once you finally get the game going, like a GTA 4 or a MGS4, you may be prompted to install a portion of the game on the system. The good thing about this is that the games play somewhat smooth, but the disadvantage is the time you waste waiting for the game to install and being frustrated when there are still load screens.. The one thing I do like about the PS3 is the Bluray option. Watching Bluray movies is fantastic, and really does create a lot of value for the system along with integrated WiFi. I also feel that there is a lot of potential for the system.. Overall, I am pretty disappointed with the PS3. I bought the original PS3 40GB which had a recent Bluray drive failure. Rather than backup their product (they wanted to charge $150 for their replacement drive not including shipping costs) I figured I would try the slim version. The difference between the two is pretty negligible; yes it is smaller but I don?t take the PS3 places with me like my PSP, so it isn?t a big deal. I just hope that the drive will last longer than my old one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Design rocks, Blu-ray and upconverting of DVDs is superior even to Sony standalone upconverting DVD players (which it replaced).. 
Cons:. Controller designed for infants. Shutting system down too cumbersome, game loading times way too long.. 
Summary:. Not sure why all the XB360 haters out there. I have both and have to admit that the PS3 rocks when it comes to being used for movies and some gaming. BUT, the 360, in my estimation, is a better gaming platform. The controller fits an adult's hands, while the PS3 is sized for infants. Simple operations like turning off the unit is a major PIA...especially if you have a projector (DLP) TV that you have to turn back on in order to navigate the PS3 to turn it off. Of course, I went with the IR extender so that is not longer an issue, but I had to shell out money for this feature. I am considering dropping the PS3 for the slim, as I still like to have it around, but again, it does not play as well as the 360.. 

$$;
Pros:. Smaller size, and more memory.. 
Cons:. Online play can't touch XBox regardless of the pricess.. 
Summary:. After 6 failed "fatty" systems it is great to just have one that works. Price isn't bad, but the replay of games due to limited online play capabilities still puts the XBOX ahead of the PS3. Even at $50 everyone is enjoying the numerous multiplayer games on the 360 so until Playstation fixes it online play I will continue to buy more games for the 360 and watch movies on the PS3.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just reserved it. Hopefully it's more reliable than it's predecessor.Smaller size. Hopefully it's more reliable than it's predecessor.. 
Cons:. Ugly PS3 logo. Cheap looking matte finish, the piano black models are gorgeous. 2 USB slots as opposed to 4, no memory card reader, and even though I only have one game in PS2 form (God of War 2) I still wan t my backwards compatibility.. 
Summary:. Ok, here it straight from someone whose been down all avenues. I purchased my first, that's right first XBOX 360 on launch day. Age at first failure=25 months, that's 2 years and 1 month. Called Microsoft, they promptly took my information sent me a box and repaired my console "FREE OF CHARGE". Age at second failure= 14 months following initial repair. Result = console age was now in excess of 3 yr warranty window so I bought a $199 arcade system which was manufactured on April of this year and slapped my harddrive on it and I'm back in business. Bought my 60G (coveted backwards compatible model) PS3 in the June following the launch. Age at first, that's right first failure = 17 months. The system although through limited use due to LACK of good games began to fail over a period of 3 days. Cause = Faulty optical drive, discs would intermittently stop spinning resulting in games freezing up and eventually not reading them at all. Called Sony and they promptly reminded me that their warranty coverage is ONLY one year and that they were sorry to hear of my misfortune. Misfortune? You got that right considering I shelled out $600 for this thing. They then told me that I'm not out of luck because they do repair their own consoles. I asked them to continue and they said there was an upfront diagnostic fee of $150 to check the system out and and then I would have to pay any parts and or labor on top of that to fix the machine. What? are you serious? I just paid $600 dollars for this thing! Plus tax! So I start doing some research online reading like stories form other PS3 owners who point me out to websites where I can acquire a new replacement optical drive because this is the problem behind %99 of PS3 failures. It cost me $68 bucks for a new drive plus $18 dollars shipping for a total of $86 dollars repair cost. It shows up in four days. The swap was straight forward and went without a hitch. Powered it up, threw in Motor Storm, Pacific Rift and hooray, it works, I don't have to just stare at my blu-ray movies anymore. 5 months later while playing COD 4 for about 3 hours straight it does it again. UUgghhh! So yesterday, I traded in my old 360 and a couple of games to accumulate $85 dollars of trade in value and reserved a PS3 slim. I do have 30+ blu-ray movies. Ok, lets talk performance comparisons. Graphically the PS3 despite its substantially more advanced hardware takes a back seat to the 360. Why is that you say? Just pick up a multi-platform software title for both systems such as any COD title, Resident Evil 5 etc. and compare the specs on the revers side. XBOX360 = 1080P, PS3 = 720P. ***? That's what i said. You will find this often. Oh and what's all those killer Playstation titles that made the PS2 hot? Devil May Cry, Tekken, Grand Theft Auto, Metal Gear, etc. Oh? They've all migrated to the 360? Some of them in exclusive form. No TEKKEN 6 for PS3 boys. Now what about online play? We'll when Modern Warfare 2 hits this November, I don't want to be the guy settlin for the Playstation Network, XBOX Live all the way for me pals. Playstation Network at this point and time stinks, but thanks for all the free theme downloads. And I gotta say those lower trigger buttons on the PS3 controllers aren't so great either. I do like the built in WIFI though. Microsoft is insane for asking $100 dollars for that cheap looking adaptor. Although I did reserve a PS3 Slim. This will keep me from missing out on titles like GOW 3 and MAG plus I need something to play all my blu-ray movies on. Screw it if you have the money own both like me. Just don't be like me and buy the STUPID Wii twice. God I cringe when I think about that.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-ray player integration, some good exclusives, free online gaming, current gen components (Gbit, WiFi, BT) included at no extra cost. Solid build with proven low fail rate, user upgradable drive which is a plus.. 
Cons:. 720p gaming with &lt;600p resolutions, some games just ports and not very good ones, console could be limited by firmware via Sony, i.e HDD size and certain functions OS install/PS2 compat. HD connections extra pretty bad for the HD promoter.. 
Summary:. Same old Playstation with a smaller footprint and less power usage. Though some things have been changed i.e Linux, I mean it's a console for games who needs Linux on it unless it's to improve on the lack of PS2 compat and even then compat wasn't the best. Needs a good service like Netflix and simple integration of social sites. Other than that it's a good console that is starting to pick up. As for Sony stick with one SKU don't make the error you made again, i.e no more 250GB or 320GB models just allow support for these HDD sizes through firmware..

Pros:. cheap and a ps3. 
Cons:. i like the glossy piano black finish better and no card readers this time around?. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally that horrible gloss black finish is gone!. 
Cons:. No backward compatibility (can't have everything I guess). 
Summary:. Of course, I can't review it because I don't own one. But as a "Fat" owner, I would have loved one of these. However, I will not be selling my "Fat" to get one.. I'm happy about the matte finish, I really hate having gloss (or "piano") black finishes in my living room. They cause all sorts of reflection problems when watching movies with the lights turned down. I also like how easy it is to upgrade the hard drive. 2.5" hard drives are not all that expensive, and are a little easier to deal with.. I also would have likes to have one or two extra USE ports in the rear, and the ability to charge the controllers when the power is off, but those are pretty minor complaints for such a well rounded device.. Good job Sony. I hope you do as good a job on the upcoming o/s update.. Updated. on Aug 23, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Slimmer, more efficient and cheaper - always good.. 
Cons:. Not backward compatable for PS1/PS2 - what happens to the 50+ PS1 &#38; PS2 games I own? Most weren't made as PS3 versions and I REFUSE to replace the ones that are. Also sounds like they haven't fixed the online issues.... 
Summary:. I'll be hanging on to my PS2 until Sony gets it right - the XBOX 360 is looking better and better everyday.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great value for a top quality blu-ray player and game engine; nice looking and menu interface is kinda sexy. 
Cons:. No on-board surround-sound decoding for older A/V receivers; watching blu-ray disks using included game controller is challenging; Mac streaming capability takes add'l significant expense and/or much effort.. 
Summary:. My wife bought this system while I was on travel because she heard it was the only box out there that could stream movies and pics from our Mac. But after a little research, it turns out the story is more complicated. Sure, you can stream from a Mac as long as A) you buy Windows for your Intel-based Mac and also purchase a proven windows-based media server, or B) go through some major software hoops to get third-party media server software to (maybe) run correctly on OS X. The same seems to be true for other standalone blu-ray boxes too. So this box had no net advantage in the end. And since we?re not gamers, the whole game side is a ?don?t care? for us.. The second reason she bought it was to watch DVD and blu-ray movies on our new HDTV. It does that fine, but using the included controller to watch a film is not exactly user friendly or intuitive. (You can buy an add?l remote, optimized for movie viewing, for about $25). But the real achilles heel for us was that surround sound is not decoded online, meaning that our old (but good) Yamaha receiver won?t be able to decode the higher bandwidth 7.1 signal for our 5.1 surround system. (Nor does our receiver have an HDMI port). The PS3 does offer 5.1 surround on the optical line out, but it isn?t clear from the user manuals that you can force this if you are playing a blu-ray movie in 7.1. And reading posts from others on various tech sites indicates success is very limited in this area. (I could not check it because my system is in pieces for a cabinet upgrade). In the end, I returned the PS3 a week later for the LG BD390, which has a lot more audio flexibility, including onboard decoding and separate outputs for each channel. This will allow me to use the optical port on my A/V receiver for my new Tivo box.. Hope this is helpful to those with receivers that are more than 10 years old (or so). 

$$;
Pros:. easy to set up. 
Cons:. set it up and started to watch a blu ray, but the fan noise was bothering me..so put the unit inside the TV cabinet behind a glass door and STILL it was just too annoying ....so much so I brought it back for a refund, in quite scenes you cant ignore.. 

$$;
Pros:. cheaper, great. finally more people online.. 
Cons:. cd and dvd playback are terrible.. 
Summary:. the older models were wonderful units for not just games and blu-ray but also as cd and dvd players. this new slim plays back cd's with so much audio jitter that it is in no way a replacement for a cd player, and as a dvd player it's poor, with it's measured high frequency response dreadful. (information gathered from lab reports @ homecinemachoice.com. 

$$;
Pros:. The Price is very resonable, and it's main features Great. The fact that you can go online and play games with others without paying a Subscription fee.. 
Cons:. The Backward compatability feature will be sorely missed, thats why we bought the PS3, so all those PS2 games didn't go to waist.. 
Summary:. I hope that the heat sensor in the New PS3 Slim will be better than in the PS3, which costs $140.00 to send to Sony to replace.. 

$$;
Pros:. Same great power in a more affordable price. Blu Ray. 
Cons:. Far to late to compete in this generation. lacks backwards compatibility. online features are weak. 
Summary:. The one good thing PS3 did was establish blu ray as an acceptable format even if it is unlikely to have the lifespan of DVD. The game system side is a total failure and unfortunately they have lost this generation. They waited far to long to get this system to a reasonable price point. It way to far behind to be a real competitor to the Wii and probably the Xbox as well.. Don't get me wrong this is a powerful system and has some great games. But the gaming library isn't that great. If you own an Xbox there is little reason to buy this system. The price point is a good spot now but Xbox will likely lower its price again, making it the better deal again. As a company if it wants to compete in this market it will have to look at PS4 to regain the crown.. Updated. on Aug 30, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Its thinner and lighter, with energy efficiency meeting many peoples needs.... 
Cons:. It aint sexy. it looks kinda okay... but it just sux. the big fat PS3 looks awesome, and its wait, just shows how tough that monster is.. 
Summary:. It sux, but get it and sell your old on ebay so i can get it cheap :) :D :) :D. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally for a reasonable price.. 
Cons:. System is now almost 3 years old and specs are starting to look a little dated.. 
Summary:. Why is this still being called next-gen?. 

$$;
Pros:. very slim and small electricity use. 
Cons:. the playstation 3 slim 120 gig downloads games S L O W i have the ps3 80 gig and it downloads army of 2 demo in 45 min the slim downloads it in 5 HOURS. and my friend just got it i hav had it 4 three years. 

$$;
Pros:. Blue Ray player, hdmi and optical outs.. 
Cons:. Still no IR. Getting tired of all these controllers. No PS 1 or 2 games???? Actually liked the touch sensitive buttons.. 
Summary:. Bottom line is, I would never give up my FAT PS3 that does everything as the slim plus plays PS 1 &#38; 2 games. Why would I want three gaming systems piled up in my living room. Phase out PS 1 &#38; 2 games.......Phase me out to. X-Box is looking better every day.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price here in UK - that's about it. 
Cons:. Sorry, but I really do not like the matt finish at all, I think it actually makes the new console look bulkier, even if in reality it's not. I personally love the glossy black finish of my PS3 and will stick with it !. 
Summary:. Love the console itself but disappointed in the matt finish of the new "slim". 

$$;
Pros:. improved power consumption, less noise are good. 
Cons:. Eliminating LINUX install capability was dumb. LINUX enabled use of the console for full-featured internet browsing, email, messaging, newsreading, video download appliance. The console could be useful beyond its gaming features -- unlike the Xbox. 
Summary:. I bought a "classic" Playstation 3 160 GB model from sonystyle online last night. PS3 appeals to aesthetics at the expense of substantive feature set. The fact that it does not include wireless N capability is a point that NO ONE seems to comment upon. Wireless N would have been a real "game changer". And, the fact that extra ports and Micro-SD have been taken away has driven up prices on older models available online would seem to indicate that Sony could have added something rather than simply taken away. Opportunity lost, Sony. Bad move. And, the idea of a smaller footprint only comes when the consumer shells out an additional 25 dollars for a plastic stand for the new PS3. No charge for the older Playstation 3 to sit upright.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1) The Price. 2) Not a glossy finger print magnet.. 
Cons:. 1) Less features. 2)Probably cheap ass parts.. 
Summary:. Sony removed even more features and I have no faith in the overall construction of the unit. There are more broken Slim PS2's out there than any other console, and I know I'm in the business of broken electronics.. 

$$;
Pros:. price drop finally. 
Cons:. no linux. no backward compatibility. PSN Store still lags behind Xbox Live in features and products offered. 

$$;
Pros:. Great price, slim, affordable!. 
Cons:. Same old function, no backwards playability, cheap design (Not look as good the older generation console), boring feature. 
Summary:. I have the 40GB version of the ps3 console. For me there is no reason for me to get this again. Is a bargain for new owner though. If sony really want to get more people to get this console they should lowered the game price and should also provide free full game online download to the ps3 owner.. 

$$;
Pros:. The PS3 is a tempting package: it?s a Blu-Ray / DVD player, web browser, multimedia streamer, and gaming machine. Over two years I have enjoyed the multimedia functions.. 
Cons:. Avoid the PS3. Your disc drive will break within 2.5 years and Sony will charge you $155 Canadian to get it fixed.Out of the 4 friends who have bought the PS3, 3 of their disc drives are defective!. 
Summary:. You can read my entire experience on my blog http://tinyurl.com/28qnahe. Eventually ? all of a sudden ? the disc drive will no longer read discs. You can read about this common issue on the net. A Google search returns 54,600 results when you search ?broken PS3 disc drive.?. People love to make fun of Microsoft. However, I remember when the red ring of death was beating up every other XBox 360 and how they handled the issue. They extended the warranty and covered it free of charge. Microsoft cared about the gaming experience and they cared about what they were trying to build with the XBox.. So if such a big company like Microsoft would back up their product? how does Sony? I called their technical support line and troubleshooted my system. Like so many others my PS3 drive was broken. Since it was 2 years old and out of warranty there is a $155 repair fee. Keep in mind a brand new Sony Blue-Ray system is $149.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blue Ray player. 
Cons:. Machine breaks Sony supports in bad faith Beware if they say they will fix for free Once they have the machine, they then tell you that the seal is boken or something else puts it out of warranty and you have to pay or they will send it back to you.. 
Summary:. If it would last and if Sony were han honest about service, it wouldn't be bad. But neither is true so stay away.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fan noise drives us crazy. Heat is awesome. You can feel it.. 
Cons:. Integrate WiFI, Bluetooth, IR and regular 250G harddrive as part of PS3. These components are reasonable prices but remove all the hassle, connectors, wiring, harder to troubleshoot and installation, etc.. 
Summary:. Create a strategic partnership with Microsoft. Wii is still the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. slick form factor, HDMI port, Ethernet port. 
Cons:. Additional remote required to play Blue-Ray disks, remote does NOT have even basic DVD functions, awkward web browser, unable to play clips and episodes from hulu.com. 
Summary:. Do not recomend to customers whose primary interest is beyond game playing. 

$$;
Pros:. It's all nice and conveniently smaller, it almost makes me thing of the PS2.. It's just as the current PS3, in performance and capabilities.... It uses less energy.. so it claims.... 
Cons:. It only has 2 USB ports, it would have been nice to have 2 more at the back.... Unless Sony is planning to keep producing the PS2 system, why don't they upgrade to an all backward compatible system ?. No IR sensor.... No vertical stand. 
Summary:. I for one waited a while, for the PS3 to get established and stable, until I bought my current unit. Even than, I had to wait until an unit was made capable to play all three generation of games. I didn't actually mind, too much, the extra cost.. I guess I am a believer in the expression, " You get what you pay for".. I rather pay an extra buck for something that is capable to do the job and look good. As a fully loaded PS3 FAT system is. Even now, if I was going to buy a PS3, I would rather have the FAT, just because of the look and the fact that I don't need to buy an accessory to have it vertical.. Honestly, I hope this new PS3 Slim is only a 1.5 update and that the next evolution is not to far. I really like to see a PS3 that is capable to do it all and look great.. Wouldn't be a kicker, if Sony actually listen to the customer suggestions..?. What would happen if they had an open contest, for a PS3 v2.0 design, focusing on features and look..? Making the wining design the only unit available.. 

$$;
Pros:. looks are good, but lack of support as the quality of hardware sucked for me. 
Cons:. conked out in 13 months and they want to charge $160 for a system that i used less than 50 hours. 
Summary:. get anothre system. 

$$;
Pros:. The 13 months it worked, it was flawless.. 
Cons:. Updates broke thousands of consoles (google it to verify). Sony's updates were the cause and they refuse to fix (unless we all pay them $150 each).. 
Summary:. I bought a Sony Playstation3 and it has worked flawlessly until around a month ago. After their system update, 3.01, none of our game discs would play anymore (they would freeze after a few minutes of play). I emailed Sony about this and they said I need to send in my system and pay them $150.00 to fix it because my system is over a year old (ie, warranty expired). After checking their forums and other gaming forums for a cheaper fix, I discovered that hundreds (thousands?) of others were having the exact same problem after the 3.01 update.. After a month of waiting/hoping on a fix in a new system update from Sony, a week ago it arrived and we downloaded it (3.10 was the update number). Well?that made things even worse. None of our game discs would load so we could play them at all (at least before they?d play for a few minutes). Their forums began filling with countless people who now had completely broken PS3 consoles, so I knew I wasn?t alone.. I called Sony?s customer service number and ?John? had me to a system restore of some kind to try and fix it. That didn?t fix the issue(s) and he said there was nothing else they could do and that I?d have to send in my console and pay them $150.00 to fix it. I told him that I should not have to pay anything since it was clearly their update(s) that caused the console to break, regardless of my warranty expiring. Sony broke my working console (and thousands of others) and are now trying to get a whopping $150 from me? I don?t think so.. This isn?t the first time I?ve had a bogus Sony product, but the other time it happened I wrote it off as?sometimes a company that mass-produces products will have some come off the assembly line as bunk. I was forgiving and gave them more of my money?.but the buck stops here. I will never give them another cent of my money again and I strongly encourage you to not buy Sony products.. I realize that I?m some guy you don?t know, but all I can say is that I?m a nice guy who is being honest with you about my experience. I have a $300 paperweight and they don?t give a crap. That?s not to say that Samsung, LG, or one of the myriad of other companies who will be getting my money from now on won?t screw me over?.but apparently this is all I can do and just hope that you read this and decide to give your money to anyone other than Sony..
