0 out of 5 stars inexpensive, accurate, plenty of features, august 6, 2009

a lot of my friends' addresses are inaccurate by any gps .

accuracy is within a few yards .

0 out of 5 stars gps navigator doesn't navigate accurately on a straight road .

speed of calculation, accuracy, and simplicity of operation are top notch .

accuracy is determined by the maps .

plus, i've always heard that there are  quirks  with any gps being accurate, having pois, etc .

it provides immediate alternatives if the route from the online map program was inaccurate or blocked by an obstacle .

it has yet to disappoint, getting me everywhere with 100% accuracy .
