this phone does everything i need it to  .
flash , reads pdfs , email , photo , sharing/social media  .
the cons listed above are really all i can come up with  .
texting/emailing is a breeze especially with swype , phone is very intuitive (search for a restaurant , find hours and menus , then there's a button for directions    even navigation    to it) so many great apps out there and they all work on the x  .
there will be bigger and better but for now this is the best  .
plus with vzw network , i actually can use it everywhere i go  .
great service  .
i did not necessarily want a physical keyboard (not a power    business user) and the on    screen keyboard is very easy and intuitive (came from a bb storm which is horrid)  .
i do wish the battery lasted longer but i know it's a problem with all android devices  .
i've found many ways to help conserve battery life and with moderate use , it lasts the entire day .
this is a great smart phone that does everything well you would expect a smart phone to do  .
is waiting for iphone to come to verizon , but now i could care less if it happens or not based off the performance of this phone after months of research , i had decided on an incredible , but when i got to the store and is using both i did not think there is much of a comparison  .
while i is running them through their paces , 3 different people came by and said the x is the best phone they had ever owned as well  .
and what i thought is a drawback , the size , turned out to be a big asset  .
very good for web browsing , plenty of space for keyboard , or viewing video , etc very happy with droid apps as i have an itouch and is apprehensive of losing all that funcionality , but i have all the cool apps i need call quality is very good , no issues whether speakerphone or to the ear call bottom line is this is an excellent phone and i'm very happy with my purchase .
i love this phone  .
just get the extended life battery .
great phone it is everything a smartphone is suppose to be , a laptop in your pocket  .
with flash .
after living with the blackberry tour for two years and (very disappointed) having had the droid x for 2 weeks now and i am completely impressed with the x on every level  .
is debating between the htc incredible , droid x and the iphone 4  .
the screen size and sheer performance is the deciding factor for me .
motorola has outdone themselves again  .
unfortuantely i am sure that this will only be the case for a few months unfortunately  .
this is my second motorola android phone  .
moved from a cliq to the droid x  .
motorola still makes some of the most reliable and sturdy phones on the market  .
this is a beautiful phone worth every penny  .
although i am getting technology whiplash with the changes in the os and the phone capabilities  .
i hope that it will slow down at some point  .
while the phone is on the larger side it still easily fits in a pocket especially given how slim it is  .
i love the bigger display for reading articles and books via the kindle app  .
i also like the fact that it is not a monopolistic apple product that forces you to put money in jobs pocket  .
i encourage everyone to support the open platform approach endorsed by google .
hello all , new user to the android os and i love the speed with my dx  .
much faster than my storm  .
i had a heck of a time getting my phone since i'm stationed in alaska  .
you know the whole ship to family in the lower 48 , activate then ship to me  .
it is well worth the wait , i love droid x in terms of apps , widgets , security , everything else you can imagine  .
i want to share http  //www  .
droidxforum  .
com it's really useful .
bottom line is that this phone rocks and i am very glad i updated  .
i is coming off the original motorola droid with the full querty and i found that i never used it due to the d pad making it very hard to type on with small hands  .
the keyboard on the droid x is terrific and i appreciate the screen space when i want to access and read a book from an app  .
my 11 year old is forever asking to play a game on it has a bigger screen then her nintendo dsi  .
now android just needs to get a better handle on the marketplace app (better organization , itunes has you beat i'm afraid on this issue) but overall , i love the android experience and the verizon , motorola droid x rocks  .
oh verizon is awesome as well  .
i came from 15 years of nextell and by comparison , verizon is a solid 10 in every single area  .
you will not be disappointed in this phone , i do not see how that's even possible  .
screen clarity is awesome  .
updated  .
on sep 29 , 2010  .
i have had the droid x for about a month now and i am digging it  .
the froyo (2  .
2) update made this the slickest thing since goose sh t  .
syncs flawlessly with outlook exchange , great battery life , etc  .
, etc  .
i can be very critical of things but i have only one dislike    the physical buttons at bottom of screen  .
with hindsight i would prefer the buttons be on the touch screen , but the huge screen size makes it worthwhile  .
after using the droid x for a few weeks , i whipped out my iphone 3gs and the iphone screen felt tiny  .
i am sold on android .
absolutely fantastic phone  .
does everythig that i need it to do and then some  .
the thing that i use it for the least is as a cell phone  .
bottom line   it's a great hand    held computer .
you can make this do whatever you want however you want it  .
i have some of my homescreens set with apps like an iphone , and others loaded out with widgets  .
the social networking integration is automatic and easy  .
call functionality is perfect they really nailed this part  .
merging calls , using web or apps while calling , turning on bluetooth while in call  .
you can do it all without much trouble the sound for the ringer is actually very quiet and i dont see this in many reviews  .
if you use your phone for an alarm then keep it very near you  .
apparently this has been noted by motorola as well  .
they released a list of the loudest ringtones available and this really solved the issue  .
if you do not have an app killer installed the phone is basically worthless and you will kill the battery quickly  .
with an app killer all is well though on a side note this phone gets noticed every time it is out in the open  .
people want to see it and love the screen size and if you use your camera often then this is the phone for you regardless of all other features  .
the camera is a breeze the phone also has the antenna set up in a way so there is no loss of signal no matter how you hold it  .
this is one of the only smartphones that can boast this  .
now that i have this phone i have perfect signal no matter where i am  .
even places that held very little signal with my previous phones  .
that paired with the fact that the verion network is second to none ( you get what you pay for) means that i am 100% confident that i will have good signal when i pull my phone out swype is one of the best things about the phone and is truly the icing on the cake .
big screen with big performance puts the droidx to the forefront  .
as soon as it's in your hands you'll love the feel and as soon as you boot it up you'll love the performance  .
motorola hit a grand slam with this one  .
you'll also love the droid os  .
highly recomended   .
best droid phone in the market .
overall , strongly recommended  .
this is the better than my old droid phone in every way if you can deal without the qwerty keyboard  .
i didn't want to put it down  .
there are cool features on this phone that i didn't even expect and were not advertised  .
too many things to list  .
you'll spend hours playing with it  .
oh , and the preloaded need for speed trial game looks great and is a nice touch .
i have never had a smart phone before  .
they were too pricey and the data charges were too much  .
well , some friends owned droids and i began to get droid envy  .
i had a droid incredible on order and the droid x is announced a few days later  .
well , i canceled my order and switched right away  .
i like the bigger screen , i preferred no physical keyboard (my preference)  .
it has become indispensable to me now  .
i have access to about everything i struggled to keep at hand before  .
this bridges the gap i had between my laptop and a portable phone (that lacked most useful apps)  .
i cannot imagine doing without it now  .
it is that good .
it does every thing and it is on verizon  .
great touch screen , lacks a keyboard though , the camera and camcorder capabilities are amazing , but for now , without froyo , it is a bit behind a bunch of other android phones .
used to use a blackberry  .
glad i switched to android .
had this phone been shipped with a clean version of froyo 2  .
2 and without the anti    rom bootloader , it would have obsoleted every other android phone on the market  .
as it is , it is still an outstanding phone , but with some quirks  .
i gave it a five  .
the screen is astounding in a way the evo was not to me  .
i guess the aspect ratio makes it feel bigger .
i dont like it i love it  .
it works  .
there it is plain and simple the iphone is a great example of what a smartpone should be and how it should do whats its suppose to  .
the droid x just stepped it a notch but to the point that the iphone will always play catch up  .
my apps work quickly there is no lag browser with dolphin i put on my phone and wow fast  .
cant wait for froyo to see some real speed  .
bottom line you want the biggest baddest smartphone with a carrier that is very good buy the droid x you will not be sorry  .
i came from a bb curve , to a short stint with the tilt 2 (last windows mobile adventure im ever going on , until windows phone 7 , , , maybe  .
) and this phone just annihilates both of them in almost every way (i did love the speakerphone on the tilt 2)  .
if you are looking for a touchscreen only phone , but have issues typing on almost any other phone out there , try this sucker out , i pretty close to as fast as hw keyboard , and if you like swype it gets better .
fantastic  .
the baby of win and awesome .
if you want a android phone that works great looks awesome sounds awesome and just does everything get this phone you will not be disappointed  .
i am loving this phone its awesome .
why would you not want to play with the 4  .
3'' display , which looks crisp , and smooth  .
now i can agree , for some people the 4  .
3'' is too much to handle  .
that's fine  .
just don't order/buy it before you try it  .
go to a local verizon store first and see if its right for you  .
i'm tired of people buying this phone and complaining it  .
s too big for them  .
for me 4  .
3'' is the perfect size , not a tight fit in my jeans , yes you pretty much have to use 2 hands , but that  .
s fine with me considering 65% of the time i'm using it is mobile gaming  .
do not let this phone fool you ; just because it has a 4  .
3'' display , 512mb of ram , and a 1 ghz processor , this phone has impressive battery life  .
this phone with moderate usage can last about a day , or more  .
my 2 best friends , one owns a droid eris , the other an iphone 3gs  .
this phone's battery lasts longer than both of them  .
back to the display though , with 4  .
what can you not do  .
watching videos is more impressive than any other phone , and viewing photos that are so clear you feel that you  .
re right there  .
there are 4 physical buttons below the display , which some people prefer over touch sensitive , including me  .
the reason being , is i like the actual click of pushing the buttons  .
i could go on all day about the positive things about this phone one of which , android software is backed by a multi    billion dollar company (google) , vs  .
the less rich apple  .
also google doesn  .
t deny apps , unlike apple , so app possibilities are limitless  .
but i must go , overall this phone is the best phone i  .
ve ever had/seen  .
and do me a favor , don  .
t buy this (or any) phone before you look at it , and try it out  .
because everyone  .
s taste  .
s are different , and one phone does not fit all  .
the product is awesome , liked it better than any other smartphones i've seen and used  .
recommend to anybody who's looking for a new smartphone  .
when comparing this phone to its closest rivals (evo 4g and iphone 4 , ) the droid x can easily handle its own  .
this phone offers the fastest processor out of any phone in the market currently , and it truly shows when customizing the phone with launcherpro  .
silky smooth surfing between screens , and the ability to tailor    make the phone to your likings makes it a very appealing phone for techies and people who love to customize their electronics  .
but make no mistake , the phone is excellent for everyday app/internet/phone use  .
most people will be surprised at just how good this phone is  .
once android 2  .
2 is out for this phone , i truly think this will be the phone to beat .
i have had a blackberry in the past , and toyed with my friends iphones  .
the droid x is head and shoulders above both  .
i have never more than glanced at an android phone before i bought it on launch day , and within a week i have it mastered  .
i can find , use every feature i want (most of which i didn't know existed at first)  .
i have set it up to receive my work e    mail and the large screen makes it a pleasure to use for the tons of e    mails i get a day  .
the swype keyboard makes replying to e    mails easier than on any phone with a physical keyboard that i have used  .
loading songs from the computer is as easy as moving a file to an external harddrive  .
surfing to my songs via wifi and dlna is easy too , and worked well , but it is much faster doing it hooked up with a wire  .
the rep at the verizon store is unable to transfer my contacts , and i had limited time , so i connected to my gmail account (i had already ensured all of my contacts were completely filled out there) and i had my full contact list in seconds with phone numbers , email addresses , and everything  .
the google maps navigation looks better and is far more accurate than my factory ford system or my tomtom  .
latitudes is great , because my brothers work in different states and now we can all see where the others are each day (this makes for a good time when i leave the shop and they ask my why i am out slacking)  .
there are more apps than i will ever browse , and the free ones are all i need (for now)  .
the network is fast in most places (i sometimes enter steel containers and the network slows when i am inside of them)  .
phone is clear and the actual telephone performance is better than my past phones (static , dropped calls rare as they may be , etc)  .
i have encountered a problem with my bluetooth device not pairing if i turn bluetooth off on the phone with the toggle  .
it required me to turn the phone off/on  .
this happened twice  .
easy fix , i don't turn bluetooth off  .
if i leave gps on and latitude up it sucks the battery pretty fast  .
easy fix , don't stare at latitude all day  .
as for battery life , except for the day that i is so fascinated with latitude , it gets down to about 30% by evening with normal use (well , it is new , so maybe a little more than normal)  .
this is fine , because i charge my phone every night anyway  .
i understand that all machines have limitations , but this phone is as close to perfect as i have seen any machine get (heck , my toaster does not always do what i want and it is a lot simpler)  .
i am an android convert , and i am glad i waited for the droid x .
an excellent phone for the price       feature    rich , easy    to    use , and works well with the carrier (verizonwireless) .
great phone  .
this phone is pretty much everything i could ever want  .
i like checking my email a lot in the day and with this i can check it from wherever i want  .
its sorta like a computer but pocket sized  .
everyone says it bulges a little in the pocket and its true but its so unnoticeable  .
i love it  .
this is my first android phone  .
i is holding out to see what microsoft is going to come out with , but after trying a iphone and an evo at best buy , i knew i wanted an android phone  .
the droid x is perfect  .
the screen looks amazing  .
it's not a retina display , but good luck tying to spot individual pixels on this thing  .
even at 4  .
3 inches everything looks detailed and smooth  .
even zoomed way out on websites with the fonts really tiny you can still read the site if your eyes are good enough to see text that small  .
the display can easily be seen in direct sunlight after it adjusts to in which takes about 1    2 seconds after exposure to sunlight  .
i cant believe how fast this thing is  .
i found the experiance to be faster and smoother then the iphone 4 i tested , and when android 2  .
2 comes in in a few weeks it is going to be 5 times faster which is actually hard to believe that it could be any faster  .
the notifications feature is very good  .
a quick swipe down from the top of the screen will show you notifications such as emails , text messages , app downloads , system updates , and many other things  .
it also has an indicator light that will flash green when you have new messages waiting and your phone is in sleep mode  .
it also makes a very good flashlight in a pinch with the dual leds on it  .
the market has plenty of offerings for people wanting to pick up additional games and applications , but make no mistake , the phone has a great array of applications built in and waiting upon turning it on for the first time  .
i find myself picking up this phone when i would have picked up my laptop in the past because it is so fast and easy to perform different functions on the 4  .
3 inch screen  .
if you want function over form in a package that still looks amazing , this is the phone for you  .
it is a work horse that can get the job done while still looking great .
this phone is absolutely exceptional  .
motorola really hit a home run with this device  .
droid x is such an improvement from the droid .
this is the best phone i have ever owned  .
its not about iphone killing for me but just a great phone  .
i am more of an android guy but some may be more for apple or blackberry  .
if you want something great and stable get this phone .
this phone is awsome  .
obviously i have only had it for a little over a day , but it blows every phone i have handled out of the water  .
the only phone that comes close is the iphone 4 because of the screen resolution , that said this screen is larger so you can see the pages better anyways  .
i also love swipe , it is very intuitive and easy to use  .
another plus is that there are more free apps than are offered through itunes  .
i have not yet tried loading music on to it  .
hope this helps .
if you are looking for a smart phone this is the one  .
i've had it since 8  00  .
today and cannot put it down  .
i have great reception after trying phone after phone  .
i like everything about this phone  .
from my own tests and experiments , i think the droid incredible has slight better call voice quality , but the x is very good , and much better than both the incredible and the iphone in terms of camera , video , and customization  .
i think the iphone has , with this phone , really met its match .
i would recomend to anyone  .
haven't had time to figure out everything yet , but very impressed and glad i did not get the iphone 4  .
the bottom line is that this phone has all the top of the line hardware and software that you could want on a 3g phone plus verizon so you can have reliable coverage .
i'm definitely buying this in 7/15 .
more reviews like this one  .
i plan to get this phone on aug 6 which is when i am available for an upgrade , i'm really excited because it looks like a great phone  .
iphone is dead android is here and let's be honest they sell 100 , 000 android phones a day  .
you do the math  .
yeah in a month it comes out to a lot more than the iphones it's a dying breed polls already taken more than 75% of the apple developers for the iphone have already stated they'll make softwere for android now  .
simply because it's a much bigger market  .
can you blame them  .
not to mention all the new developers going over to android from blackberry and windoes mobile android rules  .
i mean seriously what kind of moron goes out and stands in line to buy a phone that is faulty  .
i mean wow you gotta be either pretty dumb  .
or brainwashed to no end  .
what is wrong with people  .
have they totally lost there minds  .
you know something is faulty and crap 2 hours after it's released  .
yet you still stand there and have to have it  .
droids are what you are  .
so why did not you just buy a droid  .
rofl  .
as a combo package of fun while staying on an business exchange server , this is a a great product for me .
the bottom line is that i have finally found a phone that i love and that i feels fits with me  .
it's big , powerful and looks great  .
i switched from t    mobile and paid $150  .
00 to get out of contract to get this phone and i do not regret it in the least bit  .
if you are looking for a phone that can do everything as the commercial says , droid does  .
bravo motorola .
if you have had a pda and were waiting for an all in one that dos it all , this is the one  .
it smokes past my hp 211 in ease of use  .
you wo not look back  .
i love this phone  .
comparing it only with the evo , i have to give it to the evo , but droidx is not far behind whatsoever (sorry iphone ) but it should get with the program and get that front facing cam  .
the camera is so awesome on this phone , no need for anything else  .
i love the camera button on the side , it makes my life so much easier  .
if your on vzw , get this phone  .
if your on sprint    stay on sprint and get the evo , if your on att and have an iphone , well that sucks  .
if your thinking about getting any phone in vzw's current line up , then this is the phone for you  .
i've had this phone for a few months now and am really pleased  .
great apps  .
good functionality , large screen with great resolution and long battery life  .
my wife who is die hard apple fan also wants to get a droid when her contract renews in a few months  .
gps , internet radio , camera , video , voice to text , very nice call quality  .
plays media with hd video  .
lots of great apps .
the bottom line is that the droid x is a better machine than the iphone  .
it is faster , has a better screen , and more functionality  .
if you like a dumbed    down experience , get an iphone  .
if you want more control , get a droid  .
yes , you too can switch  .
i am the only person i know who has done this , dare to be different .
this is my first android phone and i love it  .
the apps are amazing  .
this phone is really good for those of use with large hands that struggle to use touch screens on those smaller phones  .
the camera is good  .
i is able to use the barcode scanner the other day ( on a bottle of wine) and saved $10 dollars by locating a better price  .
speaker phone is very clear and conference calls are simple  .
touch screen keyboard is very precise  .
beware of the apps though  .
too much of anything is not a good thing  .
i had the live background , nav and all the other bells and whistles and the battery ran down in less than 2 hours  .
my general complaint with all of these new phones (evo , iphone4 , droids , incredible) is why bother with a standard battery  .
just include the better battery  .
setting up contacts is a breeze and it is cool to see my facebook and gmail contacts recognized on my phone bottom    line   a great phone and the apps make it even better  .
this smartphone is beast  .
i totally recommend it over the droid incredible , droid 2 , iphone 4 and the samsung fascinate  .
froyo made the pretty good phone awesome and i really like the swype texting feature  .
this phone also has really nice call quality and motorola is known for making durable cell phones  .
this phone fells expensive and it certainly doesnt have that cheap feeling  .
this is undoubtedly one of the best phones on the market of of right now  .
i would highly recommend this product  .
i is not looking for an iphone killer , just a verizon phone that would allow me to check e    mail , utilize apps and not drop calls  .
the droid x is all this and more  .
size is not a problem .
do not let anyone scare you off with the screen size  .
it is a personal preference that you have to try as it is actually its strongest asset  .
the android market is improving weekly which is really its only shortcoming when comparing to a iphone , inferior selection currently  .
as far as the hardware if you like a easy to read (not talking for the blind , but just more enjoyable) allowing longer reading time with less eye strain (compared to the   3  .
7 inch options) and great video playback this is the droid you are looking for  .
having tasted froyo (2  .
2) i will say the phone is a 4 star on 2  .
1 and a 4  .
5 star on 2  .
2 which is around the corner  .
as a newb to the smart phone scene , i'm loving this cameras   hd camcorder feature is fun to play with , but the still camera is just so    so  .
you need to be very still when taking pictures and even then they can be a little grainy  .
takes some getting used to , but i think my photos are acceptable for a built in camera phone motorola has some built in social networking for fb , twitter , etc  .
i thought it is just ok , and prefer the fb app i found the wi    fi and gps to work well  .
but you have to be really careful to turn them off when not in use or you will drain the battery in a hurry love having it hooked up to my car for speaker phone , gps directions , music , etc  .
awesome all in one for autos imo  .
i've had a couple people say that the clarity and volume of the speaker phone is good  .
i have it in a motorola mount on the dash my biggest gripe is that it is a real pain to set up my work email  .
for whatever reason the outgoing server setting i normally use would not work , so i had to use the gmail outgoing server settings  .
at least it works , but it should not have taken an hour , 10 trys and looking for online help  .
might be a verizon deficiency and not motorola  .
i do not know how to tell who's to blame on this one but overall , i'm very pleased  .
seems to do quite a lot for $200  .
totally recommend  .
i switched from a bb tour and it's like i've been asleep for ages and have just woken up  .
this phone is amazing  .
swype is fast and fun , easy to use , is a bit overwhelmed the first day or two , but got the hang of it quickly  .
fast , great email handling , excellent browsing i love this phone  .
i really like this phone having come from a blackberry curve  .
i is afraid i would miss the keyboard but that has not really been an issue  .
i am so glad to have a good browser (and yes i had opera on the bb) and a useable and logical interface the phone synched well with my university , gmail and outlook account  .
my outlook worked best using the web interface my company provides (corporate synch function) and after that it is perfect  .
my contacts and calendar stay up to date the social networking synch is a bit annoying as it melds the twitter and facebook info into your regular contact list  .
i preferred to remove the twitter info and use the twitter app instead so it did not place all the fools i am following on twitter in my contacts  .
that is a bit much  .
it does that with your facebook friends too , and while yes they are friends , they are 'facebook friends' and not necessarily folks you want to have to scroll through to call your wife or sister or buddy  .
keep them separate while i appreciate the 7 customizable screens , it is a bit much  .
i could do with 5  .
and one of the most annoying things , somehitng that almost makes me want to send the phone back and cancel my contract , is the irremovable icons on the app listing  .
so , there is a blockbuster and some stupid racing game app icon that you can not delete or remove unless you mess with the settings like a hacker  .
total bs  .
all in all , i really like this phone , but may pay my $35 restocking fee and get the incredible because i find it a bit big for my pocket  .
some may not , but i do  .
but darn i will miss the big screen .
i went into verizon for the 2nd time to test the droid x  .
the first time i really liked it  .
the second time i fell in love i'm 50 yrs  .
old and i have a difficult time reading text on my bb curve  .
i like the curve but the browser is worthless  .
so is the camera  .
i watched 3 youtube videos on the droid x before testing it for the second time  .
i is very sceptical of the virtual keyboard (due to my bad experience with the bb storm) and something called swype with the droid x , i can actually read the screen without glasses  .
the browser is awesome  .
i tried swype and is very surprised how easy it is to use  .
better than the physical keyboard on the curve  .
i actually like the blur (ish) home screens it is a big decion for me but i ordered one and there is a 2 week back order  .
urrrgh  .
ok , so i had a bb storm for almost 2 years and it is a good and reliable phone  .
i wanted to get an android phone for a while because i use google based products all the time  .
it is a toss    up between the incredible and the x but the x won out because of the larger screen  .
i just love all the apps on the phone and it seems like there's nothing it cannot do  .
internet browsing is a breeze and i love the voice commands  .
the os is almost always smooth (just a few hiccups) and i generally like the motoblur ui  .
adding widgets are great as well as the motion backgrounds  .
typing on the phone is great because of the large screen  .
writing long emails is no problem on this phone  .
watching videos/movies on this thing is unequaled  .
i compared my phone with my friends iphone 4 and even with it's vaunted retina display the x kicked its butt  .
one of my favorite aspects of this phone is the gps/maps/navigation  .
it blows any experience i had with my bb storm out of the water  .
the fact that this has a car mode makes it just as good as any standalone gps device  .
of course , verizon is an awesome network with great coverage and even better customer service  .
i've been with them for 10 years and have never had any issues with them (i've lived in three different states during that time too) my only real gripe about the phone is the battery  .
i'm sure it's as good as any other smartphone battery but it seems like it takes too much work in order to get the most out of it  .
the task killer is good but it doesn't drastically improve my phone's battery life  .
i wish moto made it easier to figure this out  .
i do have to say with all the apps , widgets , live backgrounds and ultimately the huge screen , it makes sense why the battery would be easy to drain  .
the iphone does not have these features and i know it's also a battery hog my advice to anyone looking for a great smartphone (especially android) is to go with this phone  .
when froyo 2  .
2 comes out , this will be the definitive phone to have .
coming from an lg flip phone , this is my first smart phone and i'm pretty satisfied with it  .
i is prepared to charge a lot more than my flip phone , but is surprised how fast i adapated to being able to charge either once per day or frequently charge when i'm in contact with a computer  .
i love how i can quickly plug the phone into the computer and drag any files into the phone  .
i extremely love the mp3 player in terms of battery life , as i said above , turn off a lot of the programs that connect with the internet  .
i turn off my notifications and lower the screen settings to its minimum  .
hence , it allows me to survive the entire day before having to charge the phone  .
i also turn the screen off right away if i'm not using it (along with the turn off screen within a few minutes automatic setting) youtube works most of the time  .
sometimes , the network connection falls out but that's something i expect  .
it's no big deal to me  .
only wish we can access the full site of youtube rather than the mobile version  .
___    .
looking forward to the froyo 2  .
2 update in september  .
^^ ;  .
updated  .
on aug 7 , 2010  .
i traded in my iphone because apple offended me by brushing complaints aside  .
i went to my local verizon store on the 14th to possibly get a droid incredible 3 minutes before they closed  .
i is impressed to find that the manager let us in and told me he would save a phone for me  .
when i finally got it i is so excited  .
though it doesn't have all the abilities the iphone had it allows me to do what i want to do with it  .
i am enjoying the android os and all of the apps work well in portrait and in landscape  .
unlike the iphone i can dock my droid landscape and everything feels right , music does not automatically go to that useless album view  .
also , phone calls show the contact picture next to the call controls which is nice  .
i have yet to find anything the iphone has that i miss on this phone , sure no front camera but for now i used it once just to say i did , novelty only for now  .
also , contrary to apple's claim that the droid x also has antennae issues i only have one word lies .
i've never used the incredible , but regardless this phone has blown me away  .
once the majority of the blur widgets are removed and you get past the loads of crap pre    installed on the device , the speed and capability of the phone are enough to sell almost anyone  .
the camera , though sometimes hit or miss , is capable of stunning photographs , and the screen rivals that of my laptop  .
3g speeds are very impressive  .
with froyo this phone will be unstoppable .
reception    .
first test ; on an inside elevator , doors closed floor 8 (in a 20 story building)  .
none of the phones were able to make a call  .
calls initiated before entering the elevator were dropped (with both devices) second test ; underground parking  .
nokia dropped calls and is not able to initiate any calls  .
droid x , calls not dropped but voice quality deteriorated third test ; a street downtown between tall buildings  .
while the nokia is not able to initiate calls , the droid x is able to do them even though the communication is interrupted variables were minimized calling the same persons , representing the four main cell phone carriers ; att , vzn , sprint and t    mobile  .
i am aware that this test is more of indicative of different carrier coverage and signal strength than differences in the phones as such call quality    .
after each call (made or received) i told the person who i talked with that i have changed my phone and wanted his/her opinion if they heard me better , the same or worse than before  .
half of them responded that voice quality is the same and half said that it is better  .
no one said that it is worst and the nokia  .
s are well known for their good mike speakerphone  .
worth mentioning that calls were made under multiple settings such as windy places , a noisy shopping center and also in the silence of my office  .
perhaps , the key factor for the droid  .
s performance it  .
s the multiple microphones it uses , one for cancelling environmental noise battery life    .
perhaps , the most important factor in my decision to keep or exchange the droid x  .
nokia phones have an excellent battery life and my e    71 is charged for an hour every other day or even every third day with regular use  .
regular use for me is from five to ten short calls a day , checking e    mails and browsing the internet a couple of times a day  .
wi    fi is always on receiving e    mails and bluetooth always enabled with either headphones or even the car stereo the droid x allows users many configurations regarding battery use and which applications features are on or off as well as how illuminated you want the screen  .
it becomes even more user customizable with third party applications but i decided to run the battery duration tests with the three settings that moto offers  .
worth reminding that on a device with such a big display , most of the battery will be used by it to conduct this test you just go into settings/ battery manager/battery profile  .
there are three native options ; performance , smart and battery saver mode  .
the results with my  .
regular use  .
were    .
performance   after overnight charging , using the performance setting (with the brightest display illumination) battery lasted an average of 28 hours smart mode   same use after overnight charging , the battery lasted an average of 36 hours on three trials battery saver mode   similar use charge , battery is lasting over 40 hours with at least 50% of the charge left according to the device battery meter (with said setting)  .
on this mode , the battery use by the display shows only 29% compared with 34% use for the cell standby , 19% for voice calls , 11% for phone idle and 9% for the bluetooth  .
this mode allows you also to configure specific settings for peak hours and off    peak hours as well as individual display brightness  .
i have not tried yet the phone over 40 hours without recharging , afraid that might have a dead phone at some time conclusions    .
i am aware that this initial review might be subjective , has variables outside my control but though of publishing it to help consumers that are not decided on what device to get in this revolutionary summer of new smartphones  .
it will be very useful if others can compare the droid x with similar devices using the same carrier ; vzn  .
as for my needs , the droid x does fulfill the three main ones and seems that it is a keeper .
excellent phone , well made , the phone quality is very good  .
many people focus on features like camera , video , internet , etc  .
all of these features work very well but this is still a phone the phone quality of making and receiving calls is excellent  .
the only negative is battery life which is poor  .
in the near future seidio company will have a 3500mah extended battery available and this will solve the poor battery life with the motorola standard battery  .
i traded in my htc droid incredible for the droid x and i am very happy that i did that  .
in my opinion the droid x is an excellent smartphone .
let iphone fanatics call theirs a phone    this is a little computer that runs an operating system that is not windows or mac  .
and it's the best non    mac screen size and res for computing and video/photo functions  .
the first one that ever made phone web    surfing make any sense to me this phone it's droid relatives mark the beginning of the rise of android as the portable open    source operating system and will be incorporated into and compatible with upcoming chrome operating system  .
many developers will write for android from now on    not just for phones but for future personal computers too  .
this droid and it relatives should make microsoft wet its pants  .
do not bet against google on this one i love this damned thing    i bought two more for my daughters and hope we all get grand    fathered in on unlimited verizon internet when they start metering your internet access not perfect    but what is  .
it will take awhile for all of it's mysteries and glitches (and andoid 2  .
2 in less than a month) reveal themselves  .
for now , the thing works well as wireless computer , camera , and phone highly recommended .
finally a phone for old folks that need big letters/numbers etc 5  phone  .
been an iphone 2g/3g/3gs user 4 awhile then got d iphone 4 but i sent it back cuz of d antenna issues work in d military and d signal is great in d hospital  .
like i said cant complain 4 now .
right off    i do not have experience with any other smart phone with which to compare the droid x  .
i have been waiting to make the switch from a basic lg cell phone to a smartphone , and the droid x is the one to do it for me  .
i wanted the large , clean display , the higher mp camera and the hdmi capability , but i got so much more in the droid x  .
i didn't even realize it had the voice to text for web searches , navigation and writing emails    saving time typing out website addresses , etc  .
and that feature has been incredibly accurate (and good for a chuckle when it  .
s not) before this i had never used an on    screen keyboard , but found both the traditional qwerty and the innovative swype to be very easy to use with my large fingers , and there is hardly a learning curve involved i find it amazing that it seems to  .
know  .
which hyperlink i want on a non    mobile webpage when many are right next to each other       but it is very accurate regarding the battery life , i haven't had it long enough to really make a judgement call  .
i do recommend that you keep it on the charger longer than you think may be required the first couple of times , after fully discharging the battery each time , as i believe it will help the battery's memory for holding a charge longer  .
others may want to correct me if thistechnique is faulty  .
as others have posted , be sure to manually shut down apps you are not readily using , as this can eat up your battery charge i'm not crazy about the computerized voice announcing my incoming calls    i would much prefer to tie my own recording of my contacts' names as i did with my old lg  .
perhaps there is a way of doing this by recording an mp3 and transferring it  .
i just need to explore a little more  .
i do plan to create my own general ringtone in just this way it appears my camera is taking pics at 6 mps only , but none seem to be sharp enough  .
i installed a free p shop app , and plan to use it to try and improve the results  .
let's face it , you should carry a good camera with you if you want high quality shots       this is just a cool feature    along with the video capability       to have with you at all times another tip    as you select different functions when you first get the droid x , check out the menu screen for additional functions which can really expand the way you use it it's a dream to not have to consistently go to the internet to check for new mail in my various email accounts  .
the notification bar at the top is terrific    just a few seconds and i can access my new mail some of the screens just look untechy/unattractive to me    such as the settings scroll page    but this is such a little gripe i'm not very tech savvy , but have found the ui of the android os quite intuitive and not frustrating to get the hang of my home page now has everything i want on it without using any of the other screens    though it's great that there's room to grow as i discover other uses/apps i carry a very , very small purse    and is afraid that the droid x might be too heavy or bulky       but it slid right in with no noticeable weight difference  .
i didn  .
t find the camera protrusion on the back to be any kind of a problem at all when using it as a phone , i do find the large , boxy shape to be somewhat uncomfortable , but it  .
s ok  .
i prefer to have the large graphic display for all of its many other uses i  .
m concerned about protecting the screen , and will be looking for tips on the best case for protection while still being able to use the device like others    i just cannot put it down  .
love the droid x .
buy it  .
no issues  .
also , buy the screen protectors and at least a shell for it .
did alot of research on the internet prior to purchasing this phone , and the around 90% of all reviews i read came back with great things to say about this phone  .
traded up this phone from a htc hero  .
no major complaints found at this time , except as mentioned before   battery life .
i usually am the one reading the reviews to make my decisions and leave it at that , but i felt compelled to put it out there that this is without a doubt the real deal , the big boy , the head honcho of cell phones right now    lightning fast with the ti processor  .
fantastic call quality  .
big beautiful screen  .
feels light , despite its size and fits nicely in your pocket (i suggest getting the glossy phone protector so you dont pull out a pocket sock everytime you answer your phone  .
chalked full of endless app options  .
great touch sensitivity  .
roomy keyboard and perfect those with larger meat hooks    i is iffy about the camera housing that bumps out of the bottom of the phone , but it actually makes the phone feel more comfortable to hold     bottom , bottom line      .
it took the consumer reports denial of the iphone and about 10 minutes of playing around with the droidx to push me over the iphone/droid fence that i've been walking along for the past year  .
i know that boasting one phone over the other is like discussing religion and politcs at the dinner table now a days , but if you are caught in the middle of the fire fight , do yourself a favor and nerd out with the droid for a while .
i returned my lackluster iphone 4 and went to the droid x  .
best decision i've ever made  .
there are plenty of great droid x reviews out there  .
so , i'll just give a straight up battle royal , showing all the benefits i've found in the droid x over the iphone 4 (because we know the comparison this summer will be inevetable)  .

this post is not meant to be a waste of time for you to read  .
i just felt it is necessary to reply to other's posts that are talking about the phone as if they have it and are already using it  .
it has not come out yet  .
from the 4 or so different website reviews i've read , pc mag , cnet and others , there are positive's and negatives  .
i will be using it for internet , gmail , phone calls and maybe facebook  .
for that , this phone should be perfect  .
especially for the extras that come with it    8mp camera , hd quality videos , etc one of the reviewers is right , it's a mini super computer that's also a cell phone  .
and with that in mind , it's an awesome little toy thanks for everyone's reviews , good and bad  .
for those that will be pulling the trigger this thursday , congratulations and best of luck  .
keep in mind you will have to get in line in front of me , because there are no pre    orders i sincerely hope this turns out to be as good as i'm thinking it will .
the basics   a beautiful high contrast 4  .
screen (854 x 480 resolution) that basically goes edge to edge with glass  .
a mini usb and mini hdmi port so you can watch and play anything on your phone on your tv (provided it is dlna ready)  .
definitely excited about this feature to quickly transfer and watch downloaded content without moving around my laptop  .
and of course we have android 2  .
1 and soon enough 2  .
this phone will be quick , snappy , and nasty (yes we mean it in a good way) running on its modified texas instrument omap 1  .
0 ghz processor  .
it is about time an alternative to the snapdragon is chosen updated  .
on jul 17 , 2010  .
i've heard lots of complaints about the large size of this phone , but i had no issues with the pocketability and found the large screen to be more of a pro than a con .
contrary to most reviewers i actually like motoblur  .
i love almost everything about this phone  .
my few gripes are that it gets a lot of slowdown once plugged in to a computer  .
so much so that i can not text or select anything with any accuracy  .
not a big deal if you don't plug into your computer much  .
i don't , but still something worth noting  .
my biggest problem is the music player  .
it organizes songs by alphabetical order , not original album order  .
very annoying  .
easy fix to this is just get a new media player from the market  .
i have also had more than enough frustrating experiences trying to sync my music with itunes and have tried various ways with no luck  .
the closest i have gotten is doubles of everything for some reason  .
i have decided to scrap the idea and just keep the ipod in my car for now bottom line is that this is a great phone  .
i love the camera and with the editing software that can be found in the marketplace , you can create some very high quality pictures  .
i love the screen size and do not find it too bulky at all  .
the processor is fast and it handles multi    tasking well  .
if you're looking to replace the old ipod , you might have frustration in store for you , but everything else is great .
offer the zoomless feature fixable in software upgrade or android on line apps to access it free to fix zoomless  .
and keep alot of happy motorola users of droid    x more pleased than zoomless camcorder disappointed  .
the device has several different home screens so i set up each one for a different purpose  .
it linked quickly and easily with my verizon email account  .
i have connected the phone to several bluetooth devices  .
pairing is very easy , and the phone has worked flawlessly when connected  .
i highly recommend this phone  .
love it , works great  .
i dont really call it a phone i call it an everything machine when you download apps into it that let it do everything  .
lets face it , we would all have i    phones if they worked with verizon  .
at t bad , verizon excellent  .
but , if you want your phone to work well and upload and download fast anywhere in the usa and have unlimited data then get the droid x  .
if you do not care about making calls , and want to play around with apps buy the i    pod  .
if this is their real first attempt at toppling the giant i    phone it is good and it will only get better .
i've been with verizon for so many years , and they have great customer service i've always heard about how sprint customer service not so good i've tested heavily verizon droid x and sprint evo 4g to decide which one to choose for me and my wife they are very identical  .
but for me , sprint evo 4g won (10    9) below are the major 19 factor that are different that i care about (everything else matches)    .
1    cost for 2 years (evo wins)  .
2    front face camera (evo wins)  .
3    battery life (droid wins)  .
4    camera button (droid wins)  .
5    good charger location (evo wins)  .
6    customer service and network (droid wins)  .
7    zoom and align text when clicked (evo wins)  .
8    swype (droid wins)  .
9    skype (droid wins)  .
10    weight (droid wins)  .
11    4g network (evo wins)  .
12    sound quality (evo wins)  .
13    speed test at home (droid wins)  .
14    speed test at work (evo wins)  .
15    16 gb sim card (droid wins)  .
16    sprint navigator free/vz navigator extra charge (evo wins)  .
17    banner info always on top (droid wins)  .
18    easy to find phone contacts (evo wins)  .
19    autofind when searching for application at market (evo wins)  .
i've been with sprint since the beginning of this month and so far , sprint customer service is very good , i also heard that they've improved the last two    three years good luck with your decision making .
i have had windows and blackberry smart phones and this one is hands down my favorite  .
windows integrates best with exchange as the mail client works like outlook but that is really its asset  .
the bb is the best when it comes to business apps and phone calls related to battery life  .
you cannot beat it but the interface is so plane and boring  .
the droid x does not come with the best mail client but the droid market gives you better options i travel quite a bit so i have always had to carry my mp3 player and a phone  .
going through airport security , i feared i would leave one of them or something else trying to keep up with the devices  .
now i love that i have one device (that's not a proprietary brick) to keep up with after undressing for tsa  .
i no longer have to take yet a third device , my garmin , as this will get me to unfamiliar destinations  .
and you can even mount it to the windshield with an optional car dock i have had a couple of calls come in while listening to music where the music that did not pause after answering  .
that has seemed to be isolated to just the rhapsody app  .
the other media players seem to pause when i answer .
i'm not really into technical data , and i don't use a lot of features that this phone has to offer  .
i had an iphone 3g and it is really getting annoying  .
not only is it getting agonizingly slow in loading web    pages  .
when resizing a page or scrolling , inevitably my finger would hit a link to another page , with no back button  .
the droid x is way faster , and it seems to automatically size articles that i read online  .
so i am re    sizing less often  .
and it has a back button if i need it  .
i actually enjoy using my droid x , as opposed to continually fighting with the iphone  .
i ordered the larger size battery , which is supposed to have twice the power  .
i've measured battery life through continual internet use ; and find that the larger battery actually gives approximately a third more power  .
the gps is way better than the iphone  .
just like a real gps that will re    route you , etc  .
it does have the nasty habit of locking up about once a day  .
when it locks up , basically nothing works  .
it could be playing music , but you cannot stop it  .
or you could be on the internet , or whatever  .
all of a sudden , the phone wo not respond to anything  .
restarting or pulling the battery fixes it  .
maybe the thing is so complex that it just does this , or maybe i'm not clearing out cookies or whatever  .
i have the $7  .
99 a month insurance on the phone just in case  .
i'm a big guy  .
i like the large size of the phone and the large screen  .
i'll forgive the one flaw ; like i say , maybe i'm not doing something  .
i use it pretty heavily , like a small laptop  .
it is a real workhorse .
for the latest in gadget cool , this is it , despite having to return my first one because of a speck of material in the lens , i have been pleased for the most part with the x  .
the horizon keyboard is welcomed and is the initial deciding factor as the vertical keyboard keys are too small for my fingers  .
if that were the only keyboard , the x would have to have gone back  .
and there definetly is not texting and driving with this bad boy with its size the keyboard layout , it's a wreck just itching to happen if you try (please dont)  .
there are tones of neat apps to play with and keep one busy for free  .
free is always good , and if you like you can donate or buy an app  .
i would like to see better holders/cases , like what is available for the iphone  .
despite what reviewers say , i is diappointed by battery time and have to keep chargers with me at all time  .
i know you have to keep running apps to a minimum  .
i guess coming from more basic phones that have minimal battery drain , this is shocking  .
charger cord needs to be longer as you will have it on the charger a lot  .
make sure you get a screen protector for it as well the name brand ones from verizon are quite costly but you can get ones that are made for popular handheld game units , that fit just as well for much cheaper  .
you can also access your mail , social apps messengers all in one asy step as well all in all , i really love the x it is the new crackberry to be sure  .
this is my first smartphone and i'm loving it  .
i'm a musician and have rhapsody so whatever i do not have on my sd card can be brought with me via rhapsody  .
as i get to use it more for a gps and camera i'm sure it will continue to grow on me  .
i definitely have insurance because the phone retails for around $600 at the time of this writing i had to wipe it and reload to allow connection to a second gmail account which is not a horrible thing (i is up and running again within 30 minutes) , but i should not have to do it again  .
overall the droid x , in my mind , is a great iphone alternative  .
especially for those of us who are not going to dump verizon for at t and their signal dropping antics  .
i've dealt with verizon customer support on several occasions and have been impressed by their professionalism and willingness to answer my questions i heartily recommend this phone to anyone who is looking at a smartphone  .
it does what it does well and the promised os update as well as flash only make it an even more appealing option akroschel  .
updated  .
on aug 2 , 2010  .
after being a blackberry user for so many years , i finally got tired of just having a messaging device and needed something more multimedia driven  .
i is excited about the capabilities of the droid x  .
i think this is a great phone so far and i would highly recommend it  .
i'm still checking out all of the features  .
each discovery comes as a very welcomed surprise  .
it's really hard to find a cases and covers for this phone  .
hello  .
was not the release date like announced in time to have these things available  .
anyway , i give this phone 4/5 stars       )  .
thsi phone is fast and powerfull when it works well i just got a bad apple seeing as my wifes works perfectly  .
im dissapointed by its issues with freezing and and it not being to proccess thing like voice activation with out turning off and frezing  .
and motorola needs to bring soem seriosu updates to refine the experience to the level of htc  .
its an amazing phone and if they just fine tune it , it will be the best thing out there hands down  .
i still love it even with the issues i am having deff buy over the incredible  .
i really wish the battery is better  .
other than that i love the phone  .
hopefully once some droid x specific armbands hit the market i will be able to totally ditch my ipod touch  .
(i actually like the c25k app better on the android versus the ipod app)  .
using the swype is going to take some getting used to , but i hear it's great once you get the hang of it .
i have come from a two year experience with a blackberry curve  .
unlike many smartphone users , i'm a businesses user with heavy email needs  .
the blackberry is fine for email , but weak on calendar and internet and the apps are sadly lacking  .
i liked the bb keyboard , and is cautious about moving to a phone without one i have an ipad that i love  .
i had tried out the original moto droid , but the slide    out keyboard is useless with my big thumbs so far , the droid x seems to be the perfect phone for me  .
the big screen size and excellent resolution are perfect for my aging eyes  .
the larger screen also helps makes the on    screen keyboard larger and easier to operate with large thumbs  .
only the keyboard in landscape mode is usable for me  .
i do wish that the screen is a little brighter for outdoor use  .
(i couldn't use the incredible at all in sunshine  .
the overall large size of the phone is not a problem  .
for me  .
the processor handles the screen and all processes beautifully i'm a professional photographer , so it's hard for me to praise any smartphone camera  .
the droid x has one of the better ones , but it does not do as well as an average digital point    and    shoot  .
but , it's nice to have a camera of this quality with you at all times i think the battery will make it through a typical work day for me , but without much to spare  .
it charges very quickly , however here's my analysis of android 2  .
1   it is not quite as polished as ios on the iphone  .
but it is much more customizable  .
if you think it's fun to tinker with the interface , you'll be able to build a phone that's really customized for your preferences and the way you use your phone  .
my me , it is worthwhile and enjoyable  .
so far , the android market is somewhat behind the apple itunes app store in both quality and quantity of apps , but it's improving quickly and many developers are flocking to this operating system overall , i'm very happy i made this transition .
i used an iphone 3g , upgraded to the incredible a little less than a month ago , then switched to the droid x  .
all great phones  .
here , i'll focus on the x vs  .
incredible short version   the inc has a nicer screen for indoor use , and the software and user interface is more polished with more built    in features  .
the x has a more versatile screen and is obviously bigger  .
otherwise , there is no clear choice between the two       you would have to make tradeoffs as outlined below    .
user interface   the x's ui is not as polished as the inc's  .
but , this is a matter of personal preference (i prefer the look of the x widgets since they aren't as visually heavy , but they also aren't as functional)  .
some other ui/os differences    .
the x phone dialer is not as nice       with the inc  .
, you can just dial the first few digits corresponding to a name in your address book  voice control is easier on the x  .
hold home then say a command (this makes up for the dialer)  .
no option to reduce ringer volume when picking up the phone as with inc  .
inc  .
has option to leave phone upside down on a desk       incoming calls will then cause one beep  .
with the x , turn the phone over to silence the ringer (but it rings if it's already face    down)  the htc mail widget is worth a separate mention   it allows you to easily scroll through messages without opening the mail app  .
i found it useful as a way to catch up between meetings  .
no such widget is on the x look and feel   the x is not really as big as you might think  .
i am a big guy , and it is nice to find a phone that is the right size for me  .
relative to the incredible , i like that the camera lens doesn't protrude from the back , and that the phone feels thinner  .
it does fit better in my hand , and the big screen makes everything from typing to reading easier  .
those with younger eyes and smaller fingers might prefer the opposite  .
the x seems to be made of plastic despite reports that it is made of metal , but it does feel solid joystick   the incredible has a joystick , the x doesn't  .
it is helpful when editing text       no need point my fat finger in between letters to insert , i could just scroll the joystick keyboards   x comes the swipe kb built    in , plus a multitouch version of the stock android kb  .
no clear winner here (i'm sure you can eventually get swipe for the inc) browser   the sense browser is nicer  .
it is smart about re    wrapping text when you zoom in and out , and double    tapping usually zooms in where you want  .
the x browser doesn't re    wrap the text as well , and you will often find yourself using horizontal scrolling  .
no cut    and    paste in the x browser as with the inc  .
i think you can open more tabs , but i'd have to confirm this android 2  .
2   it is worth mentioning that the x will (per motorola) get the android 2  .
2 update in august  .
the droid inc  .
will get it sometime before the end of the year (per htc)  .
2 is rumored to increase speed , among other things  .
but neither phone has it now , so who knows screen   the x has an lcd , no real surprises   it is passable in most light levels  .
the incredible's amoled screen is wonderful under medium to low light (very good color contrast) , but too washed out under bright light  .
again , it is a trade off       do you prefer a great indoor screen , or a good all    purpose screen  .
(note   the inc is usable under bright light , but barely) camera   the x has a dedicated physical camera button , making it quicker to open the camera and take a pic  .
however , the incredible has tap    to    focus  .
the x does do 720p hd video recording and there is a noise cancelling mic for video recording  .
(rumor   inc will get 720p in a software update soon)  .
phone   the x's dialer is not as feature rich (see above)  .
i've made several test calls   on the inc , the people i call reported that my voice is tinny  .
the same people report great call quality with the x , perhaps because of the noise cancelling mic  .
(not present on the inc)  .
however , i found the earpiece speaker on the inc  .
to be clearer and louder reception   reception is good  .
note that you cannot compare reception by using the bars       you need to look at the db reading  .
on the inc , go to settings    about    network , on the x go to settings    about    status (better values are closer to zero)  .
the x gets consistently better values than the inc did in the same spots (but , that can vary from day    to    day , so this is not conclusive)  .
the x is getting a stronger signal than my dad's moto droid in side    by    side tests (~5dbm on average  .
) , whereas the moto droid beat the inc in side    by    side tests (about 2dbm on average)  .
i do not know if this translates into any real    world benefit , and it could have more to do with my local conditions/towers  .
the speedtest  .
net app shows similar 3g bandwidth and wifi bandwidth to the inc  .
the x gets faster wifi downloads than the moto droid in side    by    side tests (both seem to limit upload to about 2mbps) .
at this point , cnet and other reviewers should review these devices as powerful , portable microcomputers that happen to have a phone attached to them  .
from all indications , this is a phone to get for all those users that consider themselves as non    average joes users  .
i am considering it just for that  .
i had gotten the htc evo , but it turn out to be a sickly phone which i quickly returned and gave up on after my second one  .
droidx , now we are talking .
good phone on verizon  .
i want to watch all my videos on such a big screen and there is a app for android which allows me to read books too  .
though not that good yet books in your pocket and can be carried around  .
awesome  .
bonnie's reviews are hit or miss .
there are better phone out then this  .
overall , i like the phone  .
i switched from a blackberry tour and carried several blackberry phones prior  .
the screen is beautiful  .
i like the openness of android compared to the iphone's ios  .
i do carry an ipad which i love and it gives me my ios fix there are only 3 real issues with the droid x  .
first is the lag when going to the home screen  .
this drives me crazy and forces me to do things to refresh the screen  .
i blame this on motoblur which i am not a fan of  .
htc's flavor of android seems to run much smoother  .
second , it is very difficult to type on the on screen keyboard which seems very unresponsive to me  .
granted , i came from a physical keyboard but the iphone's keyboard is much more responsive  .
i haven't typed on htc's to amount to anything but it seems more responsive as well  .
thirdly , i have issues with battery life  .
this , undoubtedly , is due at least in part to the 4  .
3 screen  .
after loading advanced task killer the battery life improved considerably  .
however it still needs several drinks of juice throughout the day to stay charged  .
i would caution road warriors who fly a lot and are not near power outlets with a few tweaks this could be a great phone  .
i wish it is a world phone  .
i didn't realize this feature is missing when i bought it but that is my bad  .
i hear the droid pro is coming out later this year which should solve this problem  .
overall , i do not wish i had my blackberry back but there are a few things on this phone that drive me crazy btw , i loaded sling player on on the droid x and it works very well  .
updated  .
on aug 23 , 2010  .
i came from blackberry storm and i keep comparing  .
so all in all i like the phone  .
im deciding if i can live without fb notifications , maybe its a blessing  .
battery issue , do not leave home wihout charger  .
i think it gives me more then my blackberry storm just wish it did the little things my berry did  .
sigh  .
if anyone comes across any fixes to my little issues email me .
this phone seems great , but i worry about the quality of the product given that the screen failed in one week  .
will the replacement work or is the screen quality a problem with droid x  .
well , i'm new to the smart phones  .
i just came off a samsung flip shot , so this is all very new to me  .
i'm not very happy about how difficult it is to navigate through the settings  .
it seems a lot more complicated than on my basic phone  .
but most importantly i hate the fact that even though i've erased text messages or calls logged into my recent call list , they remain in a contacts history list  .
i'm hoping the new update will fix this  .
because other than that i'm loving the phone  .
despite it's large size , i really do like it a lot  .
i is calling verizon this morning ready to exchange it for the fact that it holds a log of my history , but have been reading up on it and found out about an update  .
i'm also finding out about a lot of cool features i did not know the phone had  .
ie   the camera settings in video mode  .
you can set it to fast or slow motion , since i have a 3 year old daughter  .
i'm sure those will come in handy for something funny  .
crossing my fingers for the problem to be resolved , everything else i can live with o and as far as battery life yeah , not the greatest , but i'm sure it has a lot to do with the fact that it's hard to put the phone down i want to text everyone just so i can use swype  .
please please please resolve the issue verizon i got 28 days and counting lol  .
i have to admit , i've never been so excited about a new phone  .
that being said , i have always been skeptical about motorola  .
i had an old flip phone from them , and also used a dvr from them for a number of years  .
they all share the same trait   unstable with frequent crashes let's start with what i really like  .
i have 7 home pages that i can customize , short cuts and widgets make it very interesting  .
the internet access is quite fast  .
i notice little to no difference in speed between wifi and 3g  .
there are tons of apps to download , which are good and bad  .
they will be addressed more later  .
the phone has 3 microphones , one by your mouth , one on the top edge , and one on the rear  .
these are supposed to give you the best sound quality for videos and voice communication  .
the music player is pretty good ; better than i'm used to having on a phone  .
i like ipod touch's interface better but it's good enough to not have to carry the ipod with you  .
voice recognition on this phone is insanely good  .
i don't know if they have an amazing engine , or if the triple mics does the trick , but you can spit out some long thing like navigate to water street brewery , milwaukee , wi and it will most often get it right and automatically open the navigation  .
you can also replace navigate with call (whether or not it's in your contacts list) or look up) which will bring up google search  .
that is really slick now for what i don't like  .
the droid x boasts a 1ghz processor , which evidently is still not enough  .
the phone seems to labor under all of its complexity even with all that power  .
interestingly , it doesn't seem to matter whether you have motion backgrounds or just a solid picture  .
i frequently get some sort of error message that says the program has to shut down , which just happens over and over until i restart the whole phone  .
this happens even with the basic os tools like camera , and menu options  .
the battery manager , for example , will do this a lot  .
speaking of battery i understand electronics , and what we're asking this to do , but given the size of the phone , and the increased depth at the top for the camera , they could have made the rest of it a few mm thicker to accommodate a larger battery (and not charge you $50 for the extended one)  .
i haven't used the phone full on to see exactly how much on time it takes to kill the battery , but if you use the screen and apps a lot all day long , you will be down to 20% or less by bed time , or earlier  .
i would imagine that watching one full movie would basically kill the battery my deciding factor on this phone over the droid 2 or htc incredible is the 8  .
0mp/720p camera  .
that and the massive screen  .
i also have a 5 year old sony cybershot 7  .
2 mp camera and a canon hf    20 1080i digital camcorder  .
the droid x does not replace either of those , even with the higher megapixels  .
higher mp doesn't mean anything if the sensor itself is crap  .
for a phone it takes passable pictures in good , even light  .
what's really annoying is that high contrast shots , like a lit up subject with a black background will have a light haze around it  .
also , black areas in a picture or video will have a strange splotchy purple overtone , cannot quite understand that like i said before , the android operating system is cool , and the droid x is a great concept , but it has a lot of faults that you will have to get over if you really want the phone  .
i would recommend considering the htc or samsung equivalents before you let the camera sway you  .
it is a decent phone camera , but you won't be making prints from it  .
verizon is kind of the carrier of choice for pilots like me because of their amazing coverage (i don't care what at t says , if you go out into the very rural western us , you will be hurting)  .
i would get the iphone in a heartbeat over any android if verizon offered it  .
the apps for iphone are much smoother and better made  .
half the apps for android either do not work on certain phone models , or just seem thrown together  .
ironically i'm not an apple guy , but when it comes to the portable touch devices , nobody comes close in usability .
they are selling into an entertainment market and not being supportive of business needs of knowledgeable users  .
am tempted to go back to my blackberry until i can get control of a device i supposedly own .
fine smart phone but i is forced to return to the storm 1 due to inability to resolve screen resolution issues .
im confused .
i have just exchanged for new unit because of loss of audible ring tones  .
even with new battery , old phone losing power because of persistent live apps despite using app killer  .
this occurred after downloading 2  .
waiting to see if replacement phone eliminates problem  .
if not , will get rid of droid and take my chances elsewhere .
disappointing , especially given the initial hype  .
i am ready to return , and go seek the htc  .
some key missing capability includes the relatively poor implementation of spelling someone's name on a phone keypad (to dial)  .
data updates to contacts is not good  .
i recognize that the phone is packed with many features (or capacity for features) , but first and foremost it most function very effectively in three key categories   phone , contact manager and calendar manager to be an effective tool  .
it is mediocre on all three (especially when compared to an iphone) the camera for its great megapixel count is horrible  .
very disappointed in the camera (which is a key reason i went with droid x)  .
frankly , if this phone is to be verizon's iphone killer , it falls far short of the goal  .
it's response both on bottom hard buttons and its screen buttons is relatively slow  .
how will this phone perform in a year or two , if it this slow now  .
in summary , i think the software implementation lacks some real important capability (name spell on phone pad) , and the chip speed is simply too slow for the function capacity  .
it is so poor , that i did not even load music to it , since i figured that would only exacerbate the performance issues btw , i did turn off 3g and wi    fi , and i still found the performance slow .
coming from an old bb curve , and using an apple ipod touch , i figured this would be my all in one device  .
unfortunately not the case i know apps are supposed to stay on and they don't drain the battery , but even with the option of battery saver on i ran through power pretty fast on relatively light use (60 minutes talk during the day , 1 text , no emails , downloaded a few apps , took 10 pictures and surfed the web/used a few apps for about 35 minutes , pandora for 2 songs , fm radio just to try it)  .
i tried killing apps multiple ways but they keep coming back to life  .
which by the way , why do i have to go to another program to close another one out  .
just give me a red square with an x on it to close the program if i want while listening to pandora , the radio which i turned on for 1 minute and then killed kept coming on so two songs playing at once speech recognition is not very accurate , even after going through the exercise of setting it up to recognize my voice (which helped , but is not near perfect) complicated this phone has so many settings and adjustments that can be made it is dizzying  .
i know it is more or less ready to go from the start , but once you start looking around there are too many options in the settings and other areas  .
not simple like the iphone clock on top had the correct time at 7  45pm , but clock app which shows larger time and date that i set on the home page showed 11  32 am  .
i do not want to have to do it , but i think this one is going back  .
i will re    connect my blackberry until something better comes along , if i stay with verizon (they better not try to charge me $35 restocking fee)  .
perhaps windows 7  .
will have to wait to see what that is about ; otherwise wait for iphone or just keep the ipod touch in one pocket and blackberry in other (i need my outlook email/exchange for work at all times) .
let me start off by saying that i is very excited to get this phone  .
i lusted over it for days before its launch date on 07/15 and even plunked down $50 to reserve one at best buy so i wouldn't miss out  .
when the phone came in , i paid best buy's full retail price of $699  .
i'm a major phone geek and had owned four android phones prior to this one (g1 , cliq , nexus one and the droid incredible)  .
i is very happy with my incredible , but sold it to get this one my giddy anticipation turned sour within hours of getting the x  .
being used to the htc sense ui , i didn't realize how much i liked it until i didn't have it anymore  .
it's very user friendly and in my opinion , greatly adds to the android user experience  .
i felt the motorola blur ui and motorola    specific widgets were clunky  .
i'm not being into the social networking scene , but i think there are way better widget choices for facebook , twitter , etc  .
, in the market  .
what's worse , the blur ui makes it so that any new firmware updates , such as froyo , are delayed because it takes additional time to make blur compatible with it  .
i probably speak for a lot of people when i say i'd much rather froyo sooner than to have the supposed convenience of blur  .
blur also tends to be a resource hog , though you can minimize that by limiting how you use it blur is the least of my concerns within about a day of having the phone  .
i soon realized there is a serious issue affecting a lot of x's where the phone will not connect reliably to a wifi network  .
even when it does connect , the data transfer speeds are awful  .
i read where not all the phones are affected with this problem , but a lot of them are , including the two that i tried and yes , i said i tried two x's  .
i returned the first one to best buy , figuring i just had a defective unit  .
it didn't help that the verizon salesperson at best buy had very little technical knowledge and didn't seem to understand the difference between wifi and 3g  .
she even had the gall to suggest i didn't need to use data that much anyway  .
so , anyway , i returned that phone and bought another at the verizon store in the mall  .
i is relieved to find they still had one in stock and even better , it is about $140 cheaper than best buy  .
i is feeling good for a little while after leaving verizon yes , i said a little while  .
i soon discovered that this phone , too , had the exact same wifi issue and even worse , the screen had a stuck pixel that quickly drove me mad  .
and before anyone tells me i should try this wifi setting or that one , please understand that i tried everything i could to get wifi to work properly and reliably and nothing worked  .
plus , a person should not have to dink around with the settings each and every time they want to connect to wifi  .
all my other android phones (and every one of the other 15 or so wifi enabled smart phones i've owned over the years) were able to connect with very little to no trouble , regardless of security type , b , g or n radio , etc since wifi didn't work for me , i is forced to use 3g  .
normally , this would be no big deal , but 3g coverage at my house is non    existent (i have to use a verizon network extender due to poor signal in the area)  .
when i is in an area with good 3g , i noticed that both my x's were considerable slower than my other phones had been in the exact same areas  .
using the speedtest app , i observed data speeds to be around 20% slower overall  .
this is very irritating , considering how much i paid for the phone  .
i think i'd be even more upset if i is one of the people who were locked into a 2 yr contract when they got the phone i do not want to say every single thing about the phone is bad ; it was not  .
i did like the bigger screen , the great battery life (for a smart phone) , 3g hot spot capability , and the swype keyboard  .
i fell in love with that , in fact  .
once i got used to swype , i wondered how i ever used a touch screen keyboard without it  .
the only problem with it is sometimes it is hard to drag my finger across the glass in a fluid motion , especially if my hands were dry  .
but that is just a minor annoyance and i really liked the keyboard overall  .
i hope it's more widely available soon so , in the end , i took the second phone back to verizon and bought another incredible  .
the incredible was not perfect , but in my opinion , it is big steps above the x in a lot of areas  .
plus , i like the oled screen more that the tft on the x  .
the oled washes out more in bright light , but it's hard to beat in normal settings sorry , motorola , but it will be a long time before i try one of your products again after all the trouble i had with your x .
you'll hate this thing quickly  .
the sprint htc evo is also a droid , and is a better , smarter phone , but doesn't work well in boston , where they do not have 4g hotspot or good coverage .
i like android market but hate the phone service quality  .
i live close to 9 towers in anaheim (i live 1 mile away from one) by disneyland and the signal strength is so weak  .
i get 3 then two bars most of the time (sometimes 0) there are very few areas i get all 4 bars , either verizon's service sucks or its the phone  .
i've had the htc incredible and returned for signal issues so this makes me think its either the phone or verizon service or maybe even a flaw in android oc  .
there can not be two phones by different manufactures with the same issues in an area saturated with towers  .
one of the three need to collaborate and figure out who is at fault because i will be posting youtube video proving all this showing the towers and map links and signal quality issues to prove all this real soon .
i left verizon when the iphone 3gs came out since verizon didn't have a smart phone at the time that is even remotely equivalent  .
the 3gs is an absolutely wonderful phone but as most at t customers know , the cell service is horrible  .
my immense frustration with at t combined with the fact that verizon now offered a phone that is supposed to be fairly equivalent to the iphone finally motivated me to give the new droidx a try i cannot tell you how much i wanted to like the droidx  .
i is just so ready to be done with at t  .
unfortunately the phone has disappointed me from day one  .
it started when i tried to sync my pc to my phone (contacts , calendar , music , etc)  .
i'm fairly tech savvy person yet i couldn't find any easy intuitive way to sync  .
i eventually called verizon and they recommended i buy a piece of $40 unsupported software that should do the job  .
i thought they were joking at first , but they weren't  .
they said unless i is already using google for email and calendar that i would have to buy software (even then , music , videos , etc would have to be synced separately) i eventually found what is a disappointing but acceptable solution to my syncing problem (not even close to as simple as itunes)  .
the next thing i noticed about the phone is how quickly it ran through the battery  .
even before i had the droidx i is curious how a phone with such a huge screen wouldn't eat through a battery  .
silly me , motorola apparently didn't think that far ahead when they designed it  .
i used to think the 3gs is bad in going through its charge before the end of a day  .
the droidx's battery is often half dead by the end of the morning , with no more than a few calls and relatively low usage  .
it's a complete battery hog that makes the iphone look like a conservation god in comparison  .
i tried playing with the settings to see if i had an app open or something else that might have been using battery but never found anything obvious  .
i kept the gps toggle off most of the time because that seems to make it drop faster than anything , even when it's switched on but not in use also , on the topic of the battery , it takes much longer to charge than the iphone  .
plugged into my pc via usb it barely charges at all over an hour , whereas my 3gs can almost completely replenish in that time the 8 mp camera in this phone is supposed to be great  .
i believe it's even one of the first major smart phones to have a mechanical shutter  .
the photos are ok at best and the hd video is a joke  .
the 3gs takes much clearer video overall  .
again , a major disappointment next , the screen scratches very easily  .
for those of you wondering why i didn't use a protector , it's because the iphone never needed one and i figured the droidx wouldn't either  .
with the droidx , i looked down after a week and noticed it already had several scratches , yet after more than a year with the 3gs , it doesn't have any (on the screen)  .
i've always been careful with my 3gs and i figured the droidx would be no worse off with similar care  .
i is wrong worst of all , the call quality on the driodx is by far the worst of any phone i've ever had  .
specifically , i've had a very difficult time hearing people on the other end (not due to volume)  .
their voices are usually muffled and there seems to be a half second to second delay on every single call  .
it's like watching the news when they have a commentator that is linked up via satellite and everything is lagging slightly  .
it makes conversations very difficult and annoying i called verizon today to let them know i wanted to return the phone and asked them what i needed to do  .
generally speaking , i've been very satisfied with verizon customer service over the years (even though i had an iphone with at t , i kept two other lines with verizon that i've had for years)  .
my satisfaction with verizon ended today when they said i would be charged a $35 restocking fee for returning the phone  .
all i've ever been told by verizon is that if i didn't like the phone , i could return in within 30 days for a full money back return  .
today they told me i have to pay them a $35 restocking fee to return a phone i cannot stand  .
the fact that i've been a good paying customer for years did not make one bit of difference to them  .
i'm considering pulling my other two lines from them now and going to sprint with some refinement the droidx could have been a good phone  .
android and motorola are on the right track but almost there is just not good enough  .
at least not when it means a extremely short battery life , a crappy camera , and poor call quality .
this is the biggest waste of my time and money  .
the reviews are not exaggerating when they say the battery life blows  .
unless you don't mind being a slave to a power outlet , do not make the same mystake i did  .
stay away from this product it seriously sucks  .
the sequence of events was    .
i called verizon wireless to ask when i needed to cancel to avoid getting charged for my laptop mobile broadband as well as the droid x mobile broadband 2  .
the customer service rep said no matter when i cancelled , i would be refunded on a pro    rated basis  .
i had no problem with the early termination fee of $260 3  .
i activated my droid x this morning , checked it out to make sure the 3g hotspot worked with my laptop 4  .
i called verizon wireless this afternoon to decommission my laptop mobile broadband a  .
they said i is paid up until sept 18 b  .
they said there would be no refund  .
i reminded them i had called and the customer service rep said i would get a prorated refund  .
they said their system did not allow that  .
i asked to speak to a supervisor  .
they said they were all in a meeting , and a supervisor would call me back  .
after waiting 2    3 hours , i called back and spoke to a supervisor  .
the supervisor kept apologizing , saying there is nothing he could do , but no refund  .
to get a refund , i would have had to cancel yesterday , not today j  .
i pointed out that customer service had given me incorrect information  .
he said , too bad , there is nothing he could do l  .
supervisor kept apologizing  .
i said he should stop it , since he was not really sorry m  .
i deactivated the droid x and am returning it to verizon wireless another case of bureaucracy costing everyone .
if tethering is an important function that you need , i would wait for proof of concept  .
do not believe the hype or commercials  .
after a week of disappointment i returned my droid x to verizon .
just returned it after 5 days of use  .
switched from a blackberry storm  .
stayed with verizon because of their network  .
imagine my dismay when the droid x would not place or take calls from / to all of my usual places (e  .
g home)  .
have never had calling issues with the storm (currently live in denver)  .
lots to like about the platform but if you cannot make or take calls what's the point  .
will hold on until october when sprint (claims) 4g nw rolls out in denver .
droid x does not live up to the hype  .
get an iphone instead  .
verizon cannot fix this widespread problem  .
i'm shocked google would put up with a product this bad bearing its android dna .
if all you want to do is play on and surf the web go for it .
this phone has a (by now) well known flaw in that half the screen will stop working  .
(search   droid x screen) now , i bought the droid x because at the time i is looking the apple 4 had its problems come to light  .
for six weeks , i've been in love with this phone , great visuals , sound , camera , gadgets and then half the screen goes black (actually dark with horizonal lines) i took it to a verizon store and the guy says they will send me a new phone ; but , no  .
verizon sends me a like new phone  .
after calling uncustomer service , they said they would not send me a new phone (even though this has now known flaw) because i had owned it for six weeks unstead of less than 30 days  .
i do not want a refurb ; i want a new phone to be made whole but that's the kind of companies verizon and motorola are  .
so   buyer beware  .
the phone has a poor battery life  .
the reception is so poor i bought signal booster for my home  .
it daily drops the bluetooth connection to my jawbone and needs to be powered off and restarted to restore connection  .
it messed up my contact info  .
the size is clunky  .
the screen compared to the iphone 4 is lousy  .
it does not disconnect calls when it should  .
the applications process is not nearly as clear and intuitive as the iphone .
it's huge and big screen but too heavy for phone  .
wait until droid 2  .
2 comes out and test to see if that fixes the problem before you buy .
