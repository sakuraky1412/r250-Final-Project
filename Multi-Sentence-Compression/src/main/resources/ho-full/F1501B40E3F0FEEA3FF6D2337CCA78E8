we’ve been staying at the porches for the 10 years or so and it’s one of our favorite hotels .
on our most recent visit , however , it felt like both the management and the rest of the staff were a bit “checked out .
” despite the fact that we’ve stayed here more times than we can count , they asked us at check in if it was our first stay and proceeded to re-explain all the different aspects of the hotel .
after having stayed here for so many years and booking the full hotel for our wedding recently , it would be nice to be remembered .
throughout the course of our four-night stay , our room was only superficially cleaned .
for example , they never cleaned up the sink in the bathroom or took away the old coffee cups .
on at least one of the nights , there was no turn down service .
however , the amenities at the porches were still great – we loved the fire pit and had the staff light a fire two of the nights that we were there .
they even provided the ingredients to make s’mores .
the continental breakfast was also delicious , as always , but the staff seemed pretty harried and they kept running out of key items , like coffee .
typically when we stay at there , coffee is out in the lobby in the morning after breakfast , but that was not the case on this most recent stay – we ended up . . .

overall , we love staying at the porches and would noramlly give it five stars .
however , the service was just a bit off on our last visit -- we hope it improves !
