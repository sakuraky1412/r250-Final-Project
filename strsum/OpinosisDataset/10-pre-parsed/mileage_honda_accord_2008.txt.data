mileage over three tanks has been 25 .

runs better than audi a6 ,  better mileage

mileage is decent around 24, 27 .

my mileage, is averaging about 28 .

handles great, good mileage, and wonderful ride .

great mileage, poor build quality of the car .

mileage jumps on the highway to 31 32 at normal speeds .

mileage looks like it will be a little less than the older v6 hondas

mileage so far is the big disappointment, low 20's, old accord was never below 27mpg .

aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, i've preferred the accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .
