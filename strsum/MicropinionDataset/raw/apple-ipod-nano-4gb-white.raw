Pros:. Very durable, no hard drive problems.. 
Cons:. No video support.. 
Summary:. The iPod nano is much more durable than most give it credit for. It can survive washing machines, drops, and the occasional spill. Since it doesn't have a hard drive, it simply has to be dried out after it gets wet. I would probably never buy an iPod with a hard drive, they are clunky and fragile.. 

$$;
Pros:. really quick adding songs, easy to find them once they are on the ipod.. 
Cons:. NOTHING its amazing..I love everything about it... 
Summary:. omgosh..I love it..its the most amazing ipod ever..I havent owned one before..But i did have an mp3 and it just stopped working..and the ipod works amazing..and the click wheel is amazing..and the sound is awesome...its really easy to sync songs to it, and you hardly have to do anything..just plug it in, and it updates it for you..Its AMAZING..You should deff. get one..and i suggest the PINK one..hehehehe... 

$$;
Pros:. slim design. beautiful. and all mine. 
Cons:. scratches. not a big issue though.. 
Summary:. wow, i currently jam with a 4GB nano i got from my brother that he handed down to me since he, himself recieved a ipod video. hehehe. its well over a year old now, and everything is going smoothely exept for he scratches. one thing i dont like is where the headphone jack is located. comparing it to the video locaton of the headphone, why did anyone think of it as putting it down on the botton? that was smart of them. and all i hear is about how their ipod nano is constantly being scratches. DUDE JUST GOT TO WALMART etc. AND GO BUY A CASE like me. i currently own 5 ipod tubes and one sexy lookin' case.. However, one major thing i am worried about is the screen. So i've heard that my nano is an LCD (which means that it can get broke easily.) thats not quite right for a $249. but w/e, since i got it for free, might as well use it freely. god gave us and everlasting life of happyiness. that is what im going to do. if anyone has question or concerns about their ipod nano, please email me at kn9_n0ob@yahoo.com i know almost everything and just might reslove your complaints.. 

$$;
Pros:. great sound, very small, easy to use, and almost everthing else!. 
Cons:. ummmmm...battery life could be a bit better but its fine. 
Summary:. let me start out saying that i think no mp3 player can beat the ipod. i have had this thing for 2 days know and i cant put it down...i am playing solitare on it now! this thing is soo small that i just wanna break it in half and dont get the black one cause it shows scratches!! Im not a huge fan of the ipod video but its ok. i dont know what else to say other than this thing is really cool and you need it. !.

Pros:. this thing has hacks:).

Pros:. ---------thin----------. 
Cons:. countless.................. 
Summary:. JUST KIDDING! Apples nano is nothing special in my opinion. I used to have one untill I got the Samsung YP-D1. so where should I start... first off it scraches easy so every body gets a cover for it. whats the point of puting on such a shiny gloss coat? It missis all the features like: Raido, voice recorder, line in recorder (can record strait from any audo devices headphone jack, raido recorder (records from the raido), long battrie life, DJing (A-B), speed up, slow down, video, E-books, the list goes on. my ipods screen literly snaped in half in my pocket. Its display is smaller than most and non artistic. to have all these features for the nano, you would be carying a ball of wires and parts that stick out making it uglyer that it already is. its just a rectangle with a circle and square. so the resurch! owners are just taking a bite out the apple..

Pros:. everything. 
Cons:. scratches. 
Summary:. Ipod nano beats alll the junk players like dell or archos. 

$$;
Pros:. The interface, the size it's just sexy. 
Cons:. Not a thing. 
Summary:. I used to be an apple hater. I believed they where over priced mp3 players. Then the nano came out. So here i sit with Julia at my side (i love her so much had to name her.). But putting my love story on hold, really the ipod nano is perfect. Atleast for me. I have every song i ever wanted on it. it's so small fits into the slot in my wallet that is reserved for my credit cards. Feels right at home in my hand. Fits nicely in the pockets of my jeans but once you have your fingers wrapped around it you'll know that's where it belongs.. The interface is simple. Honestly if you don't find it childs play chances are you're blind or you never graduated from from pre school.. Dispite it's size I feel i can drop it and it would be perfectly fine save a few scratches. A fine tough woman. To tell you the truth I bet you could even throw it at a wall and it would be okay, maybe not as pretty but i think it would just walk it off.. The sound quality is more than suitable. I'm not an audiophile but for the average joe these earbuds are defiantly nice. I plan to replace them with noise cancelling head phones (for rides on the train) but if i didn't need noise cancelling i'd stick with the ones that came with the nano. So far I've listened to everything from hard metal to r&#38;b with these. If the music sounds a little off I go to the equalizer. I love that it's all preselected cause i usually just mess it up when left to my own devices.. The battery life is great. I can't imagine a situation were i'd need this for more than 5 hours a day. So 14 is fine. I never tested how long the true battery life is, all I know is that it's lasted as long as i needed it to.. Honestly I just love it. My favorite purchase yet. I still don't love apple but i sure do love my nano.. 

$$;
Pros:. coolest iPod on the planet!. 
Cons:. case "scratch" potential. 
Summary:. This is my third iPod. I first purchased the 60GB "photo" model almost 8 months ago, that was very nice. Then I picked up one of those cute little 1GB shuffles.. Now the Nano is on the market. Wow. This is a spectacular device which can only be fully appreciated when placed in ones hand. You'll agree in a ... um ... nanosecond that this is a very cool device.. I love the combination lock. That's a feature which will come in very handy if I ever misplace my iPod.. You know a device is good when there are so many reviews on the 'net subjecting it to extreme environmental conditions such as a washing machine or being thrown from a moving car.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very light. 
Cons:. Delicate &#38; Expensive. 

$$;
Pros:. Color screen, battery life, weight. 
Cons:. I can't stop buying these things. 
Summary:. Product reviews that have absolutely nothing to do with the product itself (like b/c the nano replaced the mini, i will score it lower) should be removed, but anyhoo, The iPod Nano is great! I originally thought it couldn't get better then the photo, and I was wrong! As a long time iPod user ( owning a 2nd gen, 3rd gen, photo, and nano) I can honestly say the iPod family is the best out there and the Nano represents the pinnacle of design. The average person has about 300 songs, so if you have less then 1,000 there is no better mp3 player out there, and will stand by that wether the iPod has 2% market share or 100%. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, vivid color screen, awesome black color. 
Cons:. Only one I can think of: battery connection is soldered. 
Summary:. BEWARE: Once you go into an Apple store and hold the demo unit, you will be hooked.. I purchased both of mine on the first day that my local Apple store received them.. This is iPod #'s 4 and 5 in our household - I recently purchased two of the black 4GB models (one for me, one for a bday gift).. I can't believe people are complaining about the case scratches - This is nothing new - The case hasn't changed since 2001. Buy youself a nice iskin and forget about it.. I also can't believe that people are complaining about the price. Have they compared other 4GB flash based player models?. I have tested this iPod for two weeks now, and I have not found any flaws at all - everything works and syncs fine; I have tested syncing with iTunes 5.0 on both the pc and mac platforms without any issues.. If I have to pick any negative feature, then it would be the battery is soldered on the motherboard. But, for me this is very minor, as I can easily solder a replacement battery inside the nano in 2-3 years.. By then, we will be raving about Apple's next innovation.... 

$$;
Pros:. Size!, color screen, weight, itunes(duh), more. 
Cons:. well screen size. 
Summary:. This is my first mp3player after 1 year of planning. i was originally going to get a zen but this came out right before i went out to bestbuy. It was perfect for me. Extrememly small. u wouldnt even notice it in ur pocket. Many of my friends got shuffles, ipod 4th gen, and minis. I am the first to get a Nano. Many of my friends are like its only 4 gbs. but they ask if they can play around wit it. Its so sexy its not even funny, I chose white(wrong decision) and many ppl just stare at it. They go where's ur nano and feel my pockets for it. LOL. Ok now it sound decent... its not the best sounding mp3player i listened from. but the sweet sexiness makes me forget about it. ITS flash so u can run jog skip bike without hardrive crashes(MINI, IPOD). its like a shuffle wit a color screen and 4 gbs. i would put that score to a 15 if i could. its simply the best.. i'd recomend u get like an ipod sock or something bc it scratches easily. but it doesnt mess up the screen or anything. Also its very durable. bit-tech tested this machine in a series of scenerios. they threw it out of a car window while it was moveing at 50mph and the Nano still plays!!!!!!! check it out if u get the time lol.. in conclusion if u are considering to buy it... BUY IT. It was the best decision i ever made. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything about the unit is top notch. 
Cons:. No cases at launch and calendar viewing is a little slow to load.. 
Summary:. The Nano is a wonderful unit and plenty of capacity for most users. It holds approx. 70 albums; people such as myself that need more capacity have a standard IPod as well. Most people tend to fall into 2 groups casual music people who have no need for more than 4 gigs and serious listeners like myself who have 25+ gigs and will think nothing of owning 2 Ipods. As far as price is concerned; $250.00 may be a little bit on the expensive side, but when you factor in the perfect design, and that it fits in the little coin pocket on a pair of jeans it is a tremendous value. Great Design comes at a premium (if not we would all be dressed head to toe in Kirkland and drive little Hyundai cars). As far as the lack of radio THE WHOLE F'ING POINT of an MP3 player is to hear what you want when you want to. With a hint of effort you can record streams of great radio from anywhere in the world and listen to them on your Nano if you want to discover new music.. Every IPod I get brings me one step closer to making the switch to the Macintosh. If you liked my review PLEASE send a paypal buck or two to fredspowerbookfund@gmail.com. Thanks,. Fred.

Pros:. amazingly small, insainly fast, color screen, long battery!!!. 
Cons:. There are none. 
Summary:. 4 gigs, nice. But its as small as a PENCIL!!!!! HOLLY CRAP, I mean its amazing. Plus its not a hardrive, its flash memory, its insainly fast, much faster than the other hardrives. COLOR SCREEN!!! NOT ONE, REPEAT, NOT ONE competitor has a color screen, is this small, this fast, this cool, this much storage, or battery life in one package. CNET PROFILERS HAVE NO IDEA what they;re talking about, they should have given this a nine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very small while still feeling solid. Great color screen, and even better sound.. 
Cons:. Album art could be full screen, and easier to load. Not able to transfer data over firewire.. 
Summary:. The audio output sounds better than my 3rd generation 40gb, and the color screne is a wonderful option. The scroll wheel is the perfect size for the unit (I thought it was too small from the photos). Seemless integration with iTunes along with my address book, and calendar. The headphone jack on the bottom is much better for ease of use and fits all headphones with a 1/8in jack. The player fits perfectly in my hand and plays apples lossless a wonder compression for audiophiles. It charged in around an hour using the firewire dock cable I had from my previous player although it didn't transfer files. I would like to give this a 9.7 but I'll round up because it is so much better than any other product available.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything but... See Con. 
Cons:. Whished it came in a 6 or 8 Gig model. Oh well !!!. 
Summary:. Apple has done it again! Go Steve! Congratulations on another superior product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Whats not to love? So small and sexy (especially in black) tons of features, color screen and so on. 
Cons:. more memory would be nice but at this price you couldn't buy 4GB flash memory by itself. 
Summary:. I love my nano! This is a truly amazing player. If you are thinking about one, I definitely recommend that you go pick one up. The sound quality is way better then the mini. You have to hold it in your hand to understand the size - the pictures/videos on the internet don't do it justice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Colour Screen, Weight, Features, Storage, Sound....yadayadayada - suffice to say its amazing. 
Cons:. none....seriously...oh the headphone jack on the bottom is a little odd, but it makes it come out of your pocket the right way up, and when i have the lanyard it wont matter anyway :). 
Summary:. i was the first one in the shop today to buy one, one of the first people in australia to get one i think.. i am amazed with this thing.. and it holds all of my fave music - to be honest thats more than enough for me. ive gone from a 20gig to a silver mini and now to the 4gig nano.. in pictures it looks not THAT much smaller than the mini but it feels TINY. and the screen is large enough to see thngs well, its nice and detailed and bright.. i cant comment on the batterylife, but as long as it gets me through a work day i wont care - but in a few other reviews ive read it DOES get the 14 hours apple claims which is pretty decent when you considor the amount of technology they have crammed into such a tiny and beautiful player.. once again apple amazes me.. people whinge because its only 4gigs - it is FLASH based. the mini had a microdrive.. learn about technology before knocking it.. they have done an amazing job.. 

$$;
Pros:. little, color screen, all. 
Cons:. capacity, more colors, expensive. 
Summary:. this ipod will definitely the one i will buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. size, looks, ipod (apple), itunes. 
Cons:. no wma support, cost. 
Summary:. Just picked one up from Best Buy straight off the truck. First person in store to buy one. Also my first ipod. What can i say? This thing is tiny and extremely light. All the same features as the bigger brothers. Bright color screen. Headphone placement on bottom is not a big deal to me and leads me to believe that there are going to be tiny accesories that will be using the dock and headphone port in one. The black is sharp. Will write back with battery life issues if i have any.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Light, Crisp color display, Great battery life, Affordable. 
Cons:. The Only thing I have against it is that the earphone plug is on the bottom.. 
Summary:. I own many different types of mp3 players and portable media centers, this by far is the best one that I have owned. Both the white and the black colorsw look great. If you want a bang for your buck mp3 player, this is the one to get!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to read screen, nice package, great sound. 
Cons:. I wish it had TV out for the photos. 
Summary:. I bought the 4 GB black nano the first day it came out. (Apple Store in Montgomery County, MD) I also have a Shuffle, which is fine for a small amount of music. The nano picks up where the Shuffle leaves off. This is the best of both worlds. The clear and bright screen gives quick access to playlists and the ability to browse my music collection, yet small enough to be ultra portable. Even for a small screen the photos I imported from my laptop look nice. I just wish it had a TV out feature. Maybe a 3rd party solution will come out.. Synching with calendar and contacts works without much effort. Having a few games to play while I am waiting is a nice touch. I installed a line-in to my car to allow me to play it off my auxillary mode. The sound quality is quite impressive.. To summarize, this is the best MP3 player I have ever seen or used.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small compact great sound. 
Cons:. have not found any. 
Summary:. this player s great i love it best ipod yet, could have kept the mini but what ever it does not matter its awsome. 

$$;
Pros:. Size is a big plus.. 
Cons:. People whine too much.. 
Summary:. I have a 3G iPod w/ 40G of memory. I have about 3G worth of songs, books, and Podcasts on it. I'm getting one of these as soon as I can get my hands on one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, attractive, one of the best mp3 players i've ever had. 
Cons:. scratches easily, finger-prints, only 4 gbs, bad battery life. 
Summary:. Let me start this by saying iPod Nano 4 gbs is one of the best MP3 players I've ever had. I was crushed when I lost this cool and attractive iPod nano.. The design is similar to older version of iPod and it sure is good to have the classic wheel instead of that iPod mini's wheel. Not only the design, I was blown away by the size. The size is really small and it's just perfect to carry it around with you. I now have Classic iPod video 80gbs and I am still getting used to the size of it.. However it is really painful to use iPod nano without the case because it scratches and leaves finger-prints all over. Also I wasn't able to fit all my songs which really bothered me for a while. The thing that I didn't like most about this MP3 is that it only lasted about 5 or 6 hours.. Nonetheless, this is one of the best MP3 players and I will miss it alot. If you still have this version of iPod, consider yourself lucky.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Convenient, and Reliable!. 
Cons:. A few problems loading the music, but nothing too major.. 
Summary:. This iPod Nano has been the best to travel with out of all of the iPods made so far. The iPod Nano is very small which makes it great for anyone to just grab and walk to class, work or strap it around your arm to go work out. The other iPods have been so big and heavy that they were not as convenient to go work out with. Also with it being a 4GB it makes it great to hold a lot of music or just enough to work out or walk to class with. I have had almost every different type of iPod just upgrading each time and I like the Nano the best! I have found that the Nano is very convenient and reliable with little or no problems at all.. 

$$;
Pros:. good battery life, small, good GUI, easy to load, lots of toys to get with it. 
Cons:. requires case to keep it pretty, only 8 gb, small screen. 
Summary:. I bought my 8gb nano about 2 months ago and I really like it. I am NOT an apple person, but after my creative died for the 2nd time, I decided it was time to be try out this ipod thing. I was surprised at how easy it was to do about everything with it. I will admit some of the video formatting stuff sucks, but I frankly do not use this as a video player. At 8 gb I use to for all of my "favorite" music. Although I have 45gb or so of music, I found that 1000+ songs got me through the work day and long car rides.. 

$$;
Pros:. beautiful color display, album viewer, four games, long battery life, large storage capacity, many different equilizer options, world clock and much, much more!. 
Cons:. battery is not interchangable. 
Summary:. Personally I think the first generation ipods look much better than the second generations. Mine came free with my macbook and I was able to have my name inscribed on the back. The apple ipod nano (4GB white) come loaded with many games and is very personalizable with a lot of diffferent settings.. 

$$;
Pros:. its totally free. 
Cons:. no catch just look.

$$;
Pros:. small, headphones stay in ear unlike sony ones, large enough storage, quick music/file upload from computer, colour screen. 
Cons:. no power adapter with it, ok battery life (only 14 hrs). 
Summary:. Well, this is my first iPod, and so far its been great. I previously had a little sony walkman mp3, and it worked fine and got excellent battery life but didn't have as many features, and couldn't hold my itunes library, and to boot (this made me upset) it DIDN'T come with a program that worked with my ibook!! The nano easily setup with itunes, and i uploaded 3.08gb of music in quite a short amount of time, it would upload around 1 song per second. I like the extra features such as calendar, and contacts because now i can see my calendar from ical and all my contacts when on the go without my laptop.. Overall, ive been very happy so far, but one thing is that you NEED to buy a case for it right away or it will scratch, i bought one of those silicon gel cases with a stick on click wheel and screen protector and it works great. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, 1000 songs, 14hrs. of battery life.. 
Cons:. Scratches easily. 
Summary:. This is a very good iPod and i don't regret buying it. i just love it, i can bring it to school, listen to it on the bus and is just fits in my pocket perfectly. The only thing i don't like about it is that the screen scratches very easily, so i recomend buying a protector as soon as you get one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ultra Sleek, Nice LCD, iTunes Compatible, Click Wheel. 
Cons:. Fragile, Expensive. 

$$;
Pros:. Thin and sleek design, great sound quality, nice screen, awesome interface, two color options, 3 memory options. 
Cons:. Scratches easily, no included outlet charger.. 
Summary:. This product is beautiful. It is soo smmall that you have to see it to believe it. The screen is very nice and bright. Awesome iTunes intergration and sound quality. GET A CASE!. 

$$;
Pros:. Songs have no delay time...does not freeze while running or on bumpy roads..... 
Cons:. scratches too easily and overpriced. 
Summary:. This iPod is great but it scratches way too easily. I had to buy a case in less than a day. Plus, this 4GB iPod is $250 where as a creative mp3 player is $200 and holds twice as that!!! Apple is relying on its popularity to make people buy these overpriced mp3s, although the quality is very nice!. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple, quick, easy, and really sexy.. 
Cons:. Scratches could be an issue, price.. 
Summary:. The Nano is the only iPod I own. And at this point it would be the only one I would purchase again.. I personally have nothing against the iPod Nano, it is perfect for what I need. Granted, I always hear people complain there is not enough room for more music or it doesn't play videos, etc.. But, the bottom line is that you need to choose the iPod that works for you. For us, the nano is perfect -- it holds 1,000 songs. From a management perspective - if you cannot find your groove in 1,000 songs - you have an attention problem.. hah. My only complaint, and its more of a finicky issue -- is cost. However, my iPod Nano has replaced my car stereo. Its just when you receive the Nano you look at the size and think "now what?".. Recently I discovered, and purchased, the iTrip Auto from Griffin Technology (http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/itripauto/) this is a MUST have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Sound, Size, Look. 
Cons:. Easily scratched. 
Summary:. I love the ipod nano. Particularly as I got it free at http://www.euroipods.com/?r=38027. It's light, looks good and sounds very good. I have found no cons so far except the scratching issue.. 

$$;
Pros:. slim, doubles as flash drive, it's an Apple product!. 
Cons:. easily scratched without skin. 
Summary:. I have used the iPod Nano for a little over 6 months and have found it completely satisfying and totally fantastic. In addition to carrying over 48 hours worth of tunes, I can carry close to a gigabyte of data between my home and work computers (both Windows PC's). What more could you truly ask for? I highly recommend purchasing an iSkin for protection; easy to use, incredible design.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice small size, good sound and color. 
Cons:. scratches very easy and short battery life. 
Summary:. I've had my nano since x-mas. i got a few scratches on it even with a case. But scratches won't break a nano, and looks i don't care about since it's always in my pocket playing. The battery life is okay 14-17 hours, my cd player gets about 45 hours. The best thing about it is that updating it on itunes is quick and very easy to use clickwheel!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. GREAT SOUND!. 
Cons:. Battery Life. 
Summary:. Are you really supposed to charge your nano 4 hours before you used it for the first time? I charged mine until it said that the battery was full (about 1-3 hours). My battery life is at half point after about say, 2.5 to 3 hours.... Does this happened to anyone else?. Should I have it replaced?. 

$$;
Pros:. sharp screen, good sound quality, nice photos.. 
Cons:. battery not incredible, scratches easily, and pretty fragile.. 
Summary:. I got a nano as a birthday present and really enjoy it. the nano works for ME. they can only hold a thousand songs, which i think is enough, but for 50 more dollars you could get your self a 20G ipod. this nano really depends on your personal preference. if you don't need more than 1000 songs than why not get an ipod nano, it has everything the other ipods do except video, but is just smaller. the nano scratches easily but really has no other problems except for low battery life when backlight is on. and it says that the battery lasts 14 hours but that is bull. its more like 4 hours w/o backlight. if you want to play games with your ipod then maybe the 20G has better battery cuz this will last you about a half an hour with lit screen on, while playing games. Photos look great, music sounds great. if you want something mini and of good quality, THIS ONE IS FOR YOU. 1000 SONGS IS PLENTY.. 

$$;
Pros:. Form Factor, Flash Memory, Sound Quality. 
Cons:. I haven't found any, yet!. 
Summary:. I finally decided to go out and get the Nano. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Personally, after owning a flash player with an FM tuner, I hardly, if ever, used it. The 2GB version for $199 doesn't give you that bang for your buck. I think that a 4GB player for $249 is quite reasonable. You get the elegant player along with Apple's simply intuitive interface.. As far as scratches go, I have it in a case and the case came with a protective cover for the LCD(Belkin Carabiner Case). I do not have a single scratch after two weeks. All screens of that nature scratch. Why do you think that there are millions of cases available for all MP3 players and digital camera's alike? Heck, Apple even includes a case with the Nano's now.. As far as the placement for the headphones, check out my case and you will see why it doesn't make a difference to me.. Overall, I am extremely impressed and I finally see what all of the hype is about. I now can't wait for my iTripNano from Griffin Technolgies to use the Nano in my car. It looks so promising.... 

$$;
Pros:. Small size, flash drive, click wheel, simple interface, works with iTunes, the headphone jack at the bottom, light wieght, hold button, stop watch, color screen, minimalist design. 
Cons:. Easily scratched, White headphone, Boring games (Tetris plz?). 
Summary:. I've had my nano since October. I wanted to give it a good test run before I wrote a review. I'm still very excited about my nano. It's proven to be the best purchase I've made in a long time. I haven't had a single problem with it.. First the design. It's a minimalist design. It's as thin as it can get. Any thinner and a head phone jack wouldn't fit. It's about the size of a credit card, maybe a quarter inch longer. Fits right in the coin pocket of my jeans with ease. So light I don't even know it's there.. Despite it's small design the nano has a solid feel to it. I can't see it breaking with everyday use. I've dropped it a few times. Never skipped a beat. I believe the nano would have to go through some rough test in order to break. Yes the nano does scratch easily. I have the white nano so you have to hold it up to the light to really see the scratches. But since I'm the one who bought the nano, every time it scratches my soul feels it. Although it's not a major issue once you have a case.. I absolutely love the click wheel. Easy on the thumbs. Just a nice simple glide. The tactile buttons and the click you hear when you press the buttons just makes the nano feel more solid.. As far as the extras go, the only ones i truly apprecaite are the stop watch, contacts, and photo capability. The color screen is vibrant. I have a few picture on it and they look good. The pictures are small but not so small where it makes that function useless. The screen lock, world clock and games are nice although I find I don't use them. There are a few other thoughtful things Apple included. The album art and the ability to put lyrics to your songs is a nice bonus.. The interface is extremely simple. What I love is the intergration with iTunes. Just plug in your nano and done. itunes handles everything.. What made me choose the nano is it's storage and flash drive. I own around 840 something songs. I don't plan on buying anymore music so 4gb is enough for me and a little extra just in case I hear something good in the future. The flash drive is the biggest selling point to me. Now I can run and not worry about skipping or damaging a hard drive.. One thing I have to say about the head phones is to replace them ASAP. The sound from them is acceptable. The reason I say replace them is that they scream I have an expensive thing on me. So just make yourself less of a target and improve your sound while doing it.. Battery life is more than sufficiant. I use the nano when cleaning, on the train, while running errands and for exercising. I've never needed it for more than 7 hours during the day. So the 14 hour battery life is great for me.. The nano is overall a great product. I highly recommend it. Great for those who have a small amount of music and exercise. It's a beauitful piece of technology.. 

$$;
Pros:. color display, easy navigation through menus,quick downlaods from computer. 
Cons:. scratches show easy. 
Summary:. i had a rio riot before this(which is huge)so i'm really enjoying the size of the nano. even though the provided earphone are a little uncomfortable the sound is great.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's an ipod only smaller. Oh and you can put photos on it.. 
Cons:. Sratches easier than ohter ipods. 
Summary:. The main thing i like about the ipod nano is (obviously) its size, but i bought the nano thinking that i would carry it around more since it's not as big as my former 20 gb ipod. The problem is now i'm too scared it's going to get scratched to carry it with me all the time. I already have a noticible scratch even though it hasn't affected my ipod experience all that much other than it's just annoying. I just wish Apple added a centemeter more on the nano and made it more sratch resistant. Bottom line is just buy a case that covers the screen and it's a super portable Mp3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, lots of features, doesnt skip when you run, color screen,. 
Cons:. Id say battery life because its not spectacular, but you arnt going to use it for 14 hours straight anyways.. 
Summary:. Great Ipod worth the money. 

$$;
Pros:. Its small, holds lots of memory, not very expensive, color screen. 
Cons:. scratches easy. 
Summary:. I really like my iPOD nano. I like everything about it except that it scratches really easily. However, they sell cases for it which can protect it, and for mine, i just bought a screen protector for a palm pilot and cut it out and that works great. So it is a really good product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Very light,Comes in two colors; white or black (you gotta love the black), Vibrant colors on the screen, Apple Scroll still the best, Singnature headphones OK. 
Cons:. Scratches easily, Classic Apple Battery Life. 
Summary:. White or Black? I'll tell you that's the only biggest question there is when it comes to the iPod Nano. I chose the 'Manlier' black Nano, and it works great. I don't know about you, but the white Nano looked more 'plastic' to me (compared to orig. 20G versions). Anyways, a Nano is a Nano, it has great features: Color screen, Great sound, Stop-Watch (i couldn't believe it)plus many more features. The nano is well worth the money. If you have patience to wait until March or May, Apple iPods will only get better. A few things may be debated thought, but its to further better Apple's products.. Here it goes:. Apple knows it's iPods have lower Batt. Life. They also know it scratches easy.. In the next few years, they will perfect that, and everyone will want one. Production is high, more jobs will be created and one everyones gets one iPod (or 2 or 3, like some of you already have) Prices will fall, and ultimately, the demand for iPods will fall because of this mass production.. They are smart business people, who are taking the mp3 business by storm. Apple knows us by heart because we are a consumer society.. Accessories and this and that cost half to over the price of the iPod itself, including the music, the extended warranities, the numerous headphones you'll go through, it sucks money from your wallet but to us, it feels good to spend money, money we earned, and in the end, its worth it because we spend countless hours with this product. Onward we Go.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simplicity. 
Cons:. Capacity sufficent, not spectacular. 
Summary:. I think you know by now it's not a bottomless pit for music, but for most people should prove quite adequate.. I have a different brand MP3, and what really sets this apart is simplicity of use/design. Dial up any song or podcast on the thing is under a minute, literally. It really is a unit for the not-geek among us.. I gave it to my wife (NOT geek) and gave her five min tutorial while on a flight to Calgary, she "got it" that quick and loves the sound quality.. Of course I got the job of ripping all the music beforehand, but once that tedium was done, she quickly figured out how to specify what she wanted moved to the Nano. BTW it easily lasted all the way to Tampa-to-Calgary... about 10 hours no problem.. I am not sure what could be done to make it better, frankly.. 

$$;
Pros:. Flash player, four gigabytes (plenty for me), color screen,pics, so tiny.. 
Cons:. Scratches very easily, low battery life, price. 
Summary:. this is a great product from apple. It deffinetly scratches easily though. If you plan on getting one then you should buy a case ahead of time. I have had mine for a week or so and it is getting scratched horribly. The chrome gets finger prints on it worse than a stainless steel fridge. If you dont have a case right away then you should leave the plastic vinal type stuff on it until you do. It will keep the front pretty clean and scratch free. One problem is the price. It is quite expensive but then again it just came out and everything is expensive when it first comes out. I also love the size of this thing. It is so tiny. Eveyone that I show it to says that. The headphone plug on the bottom is great. It works great that way. It pulls out of your pocket the right way so no more flipping it over. But the battery life is nothing to brag about. It doesn't seem like it lasts for 14 hours. My old Rio seemed to last a lot longer. I have to charge it every other day or every day. My favorite part is the color screen. I cant believe that it has a color screen. It is so tiny. All in all the ipod nano is a great product. It is tiny as can be and is the first 4 gig flash player ever. Still some minor flaws. But battery life isnt that major a problem. The only way to fix that would be to make it bigger. And as for scratches, get a case.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim, Sleek, Bright Screen. 
Cons:. Bad Battery. 
Summary:. Love this Ipod nano, its slim line and bright screen and works great with iTunes. and iTunes music store but it has an. extraordinarily short battery life.. Problem solved when I picked up a batterygeek 100 hour per charge ipod battery.. So far so good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Storage size, did I mention size?. 
Cons:. No FM, Easy to scratch, Windows ITunes. 
Summary:. Ok, I have read a lot of reviews on this device. I should mention I am using Windows, not a MAC. It seems that many people think it is expensive. I should point out that this is a FLASH based MP3 player. Newegg.com has the best prices around. The BEST price I could find on a USB 4gig flash drive is this one "http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820211311" the price at the time I posted this review is $221.95 + $4.81 for shipping. That rings up to $226.76. So for ONLY about 23 bucks more you get the IPOD interface, and the APPLE style! That to me is a steal!! Don't get me wrong, it is not cheap, there are many 4gig+ hd based mp3 players for much less, but with the NANO you get no moving parts, and a great player. The interface has it all, I can even store all of my contacts from outlook in the NANO, that is a nice touch! Who can argue the interface is not great, the software on the IPOD alone is worth 23 bucks.. Now on to a few issues I have with the IPOD. First I got the black one, and it does scratch easy, and the chrome on the back is a fingerprint magnet. Apple could have put on a protective coating to keep it scratch free for years to come, this one is GREAT! "http://www.rainydaymagazine.com/RDM2005/GearNGadgets/September2005/RDMGG_InvisibleShieldFirstLook.htm" As for ITunes, it may be great on the MAC, but it earns about a 3 out of 10 on a Windows machine. I know all of you MAC people out there love your mouse, however on a Windows machine our mice have at least 2 buttons, we use the right one for context menus. HINT, HINT, Apple needs to wake up and use the button, and realize that a 2 button mouse does not make the system that much harder to use. Ok, back to ITUNES, I have not had it crash my system, however I have had the "do not disconnect" screen on my NANO and could not get it to go away (yes I did try to un-mount it on the taskbar, it will go away if you re-boot the computer, I did test that out). I unplugged the IPOD anyway, no problem. The next thing I should mention is, WHY is there no FM tuner? There are many times I would like to listen to the radio, but with the NANO I can not. Even the small MobiBLU "http://www.mobibluamerica.com/dah1500.html" has one and it is less then 1 sq inch in size. I really could care less about a voice recorder, or a FM recorder, but my gym does broadcast on the radio, so again I'm out of luck. And last thing I'll address is the battery life. Have you ever weighed a AA battery? According to Duracell �Shttp://www.duracell.com/OEM/Primary/Alkaline/mn1500.asp�� 1 AA battery weighs in at .84oz, the whole IPOD METAL body and all only weighs in at 1.5oz, so that leaves just at .66oz for the rest of the IPOD (I realize the IPOD does not have a AA batt, it is just for argument sake). 12 to 14 hours seems GREAT to me all things considered! You know those color LCD's with a back light LOVE power, look at the problem the digital cameras and their batt life, the large color LCD is the main reason for the short life on the camera.. I have Comcast Broadband and because of this I get FREE Rhapsody �Shttp://www.listen.com/partner/comcast/�� I have used this to send songs to the IPOD, and it works great! Until APPLE fixes ITunes for Windows, I'll just keep using the Rhapsody software. I hope I have provided some useful information to those looking to purchase the NANO, I LOVE mine! Also, I hope the links I provided will help some users. Now get out and exercise, use the IPOD on a walk, or at the gym, and enjoy it!. 

$$;
Pros:. tiny, interfaces fully with my car stereo, color screen, full iPod system with photos like the big guy!. 
Cons:. I had it before the tubes were available and it got a bit scratched, only 4 gigs.. 
Summary:. I think its awesome! I plug it into the interface in the glove box of my car and NEVER have to change a CD! I have heard of issues, but Ive not experienced any. Since I have a Mac and I already keep my iTunes up to date, I didn't bother with the iTunes included with the Nano. I had 5.0.1 installed on my computer already. Perhaps there are WINDOWS issues....but there are always WINDOWS issues. Mine works great. If iTunes is giving problems, its not the Nanos fault. All I have to do now is figure out how I'm going to pay for all of that gasoline I'll be using because I don't want to get out of my car!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Microscopic size, color display, flash format. 
Cons:. Microscopic size, limited to 4GB, mandatory accessories. 
Summary:. For me, the nano surpassed the black "Razr" phone as the "gotta-have-it" electronics piece this year. This MP3 player has been miniaturized into an unbelievable form factor - and the fact that it looks and works like every iPod before it is a pro, not a con, in my book. A portable device that holds ALL my music hasn't been invented yet (400 GB, anyone?) so I knew going in that I would have to be selective about how I filled the nano. Not a problem. Contrary to what others have implied, you don't HAVE to let iTunes run your life. It is possible to simply drag-and-drop folders of files into the nano. I don't miss an FM tuner at all - if I wanted to listen to the radio, I wouldn't need MP3s, or a $250 player. Sound quality is just fine, especially if you play with the EQ. My biggest issue is that you really have to buy "mandatory" accessories right out of the gate: headphones (the set included is only average in sound and gets uncomfortable after long use, a protective cover/sleeve (even polished metal will take a beating after too long), and cables, docks, belt clips, etcetera (this nano is so light, you're prone to take it everywhere, but carting around all the other stuff as well is a pain). I was never a big Apple fan before, but this is a sensational piece of engineering, and it makes me excited about the future of MP3 players to come. Beautiful!. 

$$;
Pros:. It's tiny with a color screen! Great amount of memory for taking on a long bike ride or out for the day on a hike.... 
Cons:. Had for 3 weeks, haven't found one yet.. 
Summary:. If you are looking to carry around every single CD or MP3 file you own at every given time, obviously you will not be using a 4G unit like this.. I've gotten about 12-15 hours of battery life on each charge. When you get it, charge if fully, then drain it, then charge it again fully. It'll give you the maximum on battery life.. As for not having an FM tuner.. who CARES?! I haven't listened to FM Radio in 10 years!! If you want a portable FM player, go to Radio Shack and get yourself the $10 mini FM receiver and headphone kit and save yourself a lot of pain.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy navigation, good volume, decent battery life, ample memory for my needs. 
Cons:. Easily scratched (wrap it up), Small screen for viewing photos. 
Summary:. This 4GB flash-drive wonder is fantastic. So slim and sleek, and enough capacity for a couple days of music. 14 hours battery life of course is inflated, but it comes close enough for me. It will charge via USB 1.1, albeit slower. Apple tries to keep this from you. Wouldn't want to transfer via 1.1, though. Sell your smaller USB flash drives. Drag n drop with XP explorer. Nice device. Pricey? Kinda. If you can wait for price drops, I would. Too pricey? Nah. It's sweet. Haven't read great things about the FM transmitters, though. I use my XM cassette adapter... I couldn't wait for the iPod video-capable models, so I got three Nanos and gave one to my mom and traded one for an old Dell craptop.. 

$$;
Pros:. iPod Controls. 
Cons:. No tuner/voice recorder or ogg/wma/flac formats. 
Summary:. Ok - This is my first iPod... Never wanted a hard disc based player. I am very pleased with the control and size... and I have XLarge hands. The quality of this is so much more than my SanDisk DAP 1GB player. Must haves to date are iTunes v5.01... Love this player... but there are no tens!!! Add ogg/wma/flac playback and this will likely acheive perfection.. 

$$;
Pros:. Color Screen, ITUNES, small size. 
Cons:. Headphone jack placement. 
Summary:. The Ipod Nano is simply an excellent product. Itunes works much better than MusicMatch Jukebox, nothing from Creative Labs, RIO, or iriver can touch this product. I know, I have them all. But why did they put the headphone jack on the bottom? I would have gave the Nano a 10, but it irritates me having it upside down in my pocket!. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Lack of accesories and it has to be hooked up to a computer to charge.. 
Summary:. I love this thing. This is my first MP3 player and I love it. I thought I might get the larger Ipod, but I'm glad I didn't. It carries enough music (not my whole collection), but enough to keep sustain you for a while.. It is a really cool gadget.. You should Get One!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Light yet strong, feels like nothng in my shirt pocket; Easy navigation; Beautiful screen, Wow factor. 
Cons:. Shiny back gets scratched easily and leaves finger prints. 
Summary:. Since last year I had wanted to buy a MP3 player. That was just before the iPod Shuffle launch. I waited anxiously for the announcement, but once I saw no screen to navigate, that was an instant deal killer. I looked around hard, read all the reviews and decided to buy an iAudio G3, 1GB. The important item for me was at least 1GB flash mp3 player with good navigation.. I tried using the voice recording function of the iAudio, but the microphone was far too small and insensitive. Quality was bad. I ended up buying a dedicated voice recorder - Olympus WS200 which had a much better and bigger microphone, thus having better pickup and quality. Since then, I've never lusted for an all in one device. Not at least until someone can make everything perfect.. The iAudio G3 seemed ok for a while, but somehow did not have the wow factor to me and was merely functional. A few months later, it broke down. While finding the time to repair it, the iPod Nano was announced.. Being a Mac fan (I own a Mac Mini), it was immediately obvious that the iPod Nano was the ONE. My order went out immediately for the 4GB white. Initially I thought 2GB should be sufficient, since I did just need a little more than my 1GB iAudio. But the 4GB was only a little more, so I thought that in the long run, 4GB was a better buy. Anyway, its was dirt cheap for a 4GB flash player. If you understood how hard drives work, you would never buy a hard drive mp3 player for mobile active use. I took some time to decide between black and white. Black seemed cooler and more people were ordering it. But I later chose white.. I must say I'm glad I chose white because of the finger print and scratch problems. I bought a Martin Fields iPod Nano protector which covers the entire front surface of the iPod Nano. Highly recommended. Might even buy one for the back.. Really enjoy using it. Its so light and flat, that I carry it in my front shirt pocket all the time and don't even notice its there. I bought the nano Dock so putting in the iPod on the dock makes it look like a little shrine (Apple worship!). With iTunes I sorted out my dance practice music and everyone just loved the selection. I use it to practice my ballroom dancing on my own and its just does not feel that its there at all.. I read about the headphone jack positon comments. I thought it should be on top initially, but after using it, its no big deal whether its on top or bottom, because its in my pocket, so I can't see it anyway.. What can be improved?. - The back should be brushed steel rather than chrome, that will make it more resistant to scratches and finger prints. - A front metal body would be nice too, though no big deal.. - A little longer battery life would be nice, though I've not gone flat yet.. - 4GB is enough for me, though no one would complain if its more and cost less.. In a nutshell, its great. But if they came up with one that has a brushed metal body, I'll buy another one in a second. No regrets, highly recommended. Go get your nano now ... 

$$;
Pros:. Battery replacement costs $59 but "Apple disposes your battery in an environmentally-friendly manner.". 
Cons:. Battery replacement from Apple costs $59. 
Summary:. Not like anyone will ever read my opinion on this ad-cluttered website, but besides (call it) "prestige" or something, there is no reason not to get a Korean-clone for like $59 for the whole player, instead of giving Apple that money incase just your battery folds.. So where is that "perfect" product you ask .. nowhere, people are just out to fill their pockets, increase the profits and they do not care about the consumer; well besides on how to box money out of our hands of course. So I spend my time without an mp3 player and years go by. 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous looking, enough memory for me at least, great screen and feature full MP3 Player. 
Cons:. Scratches so easily. 1 day in my pocket and came back like my oldest par of sunglasses.. 
Summary:. I have to admit I have been an apple supporter since apple IIe, this time is no difference. The iPod nano is a extremely beautiful MP3 player with excellent features, so small that My motorola RAZR looks like the grren giant. However , for those that like to carry around all their discography even though they can't listen to it in 24 hr period it won't make it. I usually carry around 800 sonng about a 1,000 Pix and it does fine. Charge it once a day as with my cell. BE AWARE THE FRONT SURFACE WILL SCRATCH AT CONTACT WITH ANY HARD SURFACE. Mine is 3 days all and looks like months old.. If you are looking for a cool gage to hang around your neck, listen to music , have family pix and show off this is what you are looking for!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, weight, flash, screen. 
Cons:. Mini colors eliminated. 
Summary:. Criticizing the capacity of the nano is like buying a Cooper Mini and complaining you can't transport the football team. If you want more capacity, get a 20GB. No one else has near the capacity in this small and light a package, so how can capacity be a con? For what this is INTENDED to be, it's the best on the market, especially when you take iTunes into account. Wish the black came with black headphones.. 

$$;
Pros:. Thin design; lightness. 
Cons:. May be a bit pricy for frist time iPod buyers. 
Summary:. I think it should fly. What's not to like. Sure it's a bit pricy but it's like what 57 oz. What's not to like about that. You won't even feel it on you. Also would the haters just admit that the iPod is popular and is a part of society instead of always trying to bring it down.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size, sleek appearance, Flash memory, intuitive iPod interface.. 
Cons:. No radio (I don't mind the other shortcomings).. 
Summary:. This is the first iPod I decided to buy (the day after it was announced) even though I've been using iTunes for over a year. It's exactly what I've been waiting for - the iPod user experience in a small Flash player design. Honestly, the only thing that would make it better for me would be the addition of a radio.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Thin, Great Sound, Intuitive, arguably the most attractive player on the market. 
Cons:. Scratches WAY too easily. 
Summary:. Yeah, for $50 more you get a 20G ipod...but for someone like me, the smaller the better. I purchased the 4G model which currently holds 780 songs, 19 podcasts, and 40 photos. That's 2.5 days worth of continuous entertainment...plenty for most people. The nano also packs great sound and is the most intuitive MP3 player on the market. For those who complain that it doesn't have an FM tuner, I have two responses. First, so what? Secondly, and in one word, "podcasting." Thanks to Apple, podcasting has exploded over the last few months - and I am a huge fan. I subscribe to about 10 podcasts and never find the time to listen to all of them during the week (I am a public transportation commuter in Chicago with about 1 1/2 hours of commuting time each day). Why would apple want to cannibalize such a great medium with an FM tuner? And yes, I said it sounds great. I'm sure someone without a life who listens to music 12 hours a day through their $3,000 Bang&#38;Olfsun headphones will have a gripe, but if you're on the move and want to take your music, photos, and podcasts with you, the nano is unbeatable. I have found the headphone jack being on the bottom is a non-issue and my ONLY gripe is that this thing scratches WAY too easily. I have practically coddled my nano like it is a newborn baby and through extreme care, it still has managed to bear some light scratches. Thus, I am going to use my mini until the cases become available. Again, I cannot stress it enough, it scratches VERY easily - not sure how apple could have overlooked this annoyance in testing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Portability, functionality, "wow-factor", most everything. 
Cons:. Scratches, fingerprints. 
Summary:. I've had the nano since Monday, and it's definately a joy to use. It works just like any other ipod, and that's a good thing. It's very portable and doesn't bulge from my pocket at all. Durability is not an issue at all; People were speculating on how it might be weak because of its thinness, but after holding it - I'm pretty sure this thing can hold a good beating before it has any mechanical difficulties.. Everything's great. The headphone jack on the bottom is good, because I can fiddle with the controls in my pocket. However, the charger and the headphone jack are next to each other, and you had to unplug your headphones to access the release for the charging cord. Just a minor detail. The clickwheel is a good size, and I've gotten used to the speed of the scroll. It really is as small as you probably think.. The body, however, is very prone to scratches and fingerprints. I have the black nano, and although it was awesome on the first day - I've had to wipe the thing down with a bottle of iKlear every day to get fingerprints off. Light scratches easily show up on the nano. It is very, very easy to scratch, and I would advise getting a protective case for it right away.. Battery life isn't all that great. It's getting about 12 hours for me, but I encode my music at 320 AAC. I haven't been able to go an entire day without a recharge. The good news is that charging is quick if you don't mind not carrying around a fully charged nano. I charge it in the morning when I wake up, when it's almost fully drained, while I shower and get ready for my day. In about an hour, I have enough juice to last me the rest of my day until I come back and charge it during dinner.. I like the option to view lyrics. However, if you idle on the lyrics page for too long, it refers back to the default "now playing" screen. This is quite annoying, as I have to scroll every few seconds to make sure it doesn't go idle while I view lyrics.. The nano syncs with USB 2.0. It's fast enough for most uses, especially considering the nano has only about 3.7 gigs of space when formatted. (Which is plenty for 90% of people out there.). I highly suggest buying good earphones with the nano. Apple earphones, as always, are pretty horrible.. Overall, I feel that the nano is beautiful and functional - a 10 out of 10 for both those categories. But it really loses when it comes up to upkeep, because you'll have to pamper it pretty well to not get ugly fingerprint smudges or light scratches all over it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small form factor with full iPod interface; color screen. 
Cons:. Can't connect to TV for photo playback. 
Summary:. This little nano--takes me back to the first iPod. It is that revolutionary in form and function. The nano is beautifully crafted. The space shuttle has less exacting standards. Gorgeous to hold and watch your thumbnail photos scroll by to music. Run--don't walk--to your nearest Apple resaler and get one of the 4GB models. You won't be sorry.. 

$$;
Pros:. small; compact; better than the Shuffle. 
Cons:. dont know yet. 
Summary:. When Steve Jobs pulled the Nano out of his pocket I was the happiest man alive. It is def the hottest iPod by apple. Check out http://www.egadgetmag.com for more nano stuff. Other than that I was wondering when the Mini would go color but I guess now that the Nano is replacing it that's pretty cool.. 

$$;
Pros:. screen,size, look, navigation, supported files, accessories and features. 
Cons:. gigabytes per dollar is descent, but not a huge problem. 
Summary:. This the best player that i have ever had. The fact that it is small, ultra thin, and looks like nothing else is just the start. Apple leads the way.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size and weight; iPod click wheel. 
Cons:. Even at max compression Sony sounds better. 
Summary:. I borrowed a friend's iPod shuffle and was amazed at how much I liked the lanyard and light weight. I have a Sony MD3 player that I often don't take with me because it's relatively big and the interface is a bit clunky. So when I saw the first announcements, I ordered it sight unseen. Haven't got the lanyard headphones yet. I've never used an iPod before, and frankly the last few days using it have been amazing.. Only drawback: When I put it head to head for sound quality against Sony using my Bose noise-cancelling headphones, though, the Sony wins hands down, even when I upped the Apple compression to max 320kbs.. I'll take my nano on my walks and my MD3 on the plane and have the best of all possible worlds.. 

$$;
Pros:. thin for pockets, flash hardrive which is far better than the ipod mini. 
Cons:. propietary battery, no fm like always, pricey (it would worth it if there were FM). 
Summary:. The best improvement on this mp3 is his flash based hardrive, because the ipod mini one came with a fragile harddrive, i dropped once and it get death, thats so bad..it cant handle one single drop.. I was almost going to buy another ipod mini, since nano was launched... so happy they did it and just in time before i was going to get another ipod.... The only reason i keep buying ipod stuff is because the navigation wheel click is so cool and the itunes playlist....... So right now.ipod is like ferrari....no matter what other mp3 players brand came out..even if they has a lot of features....they wont beat ipod.... peace..go get yours...u wll thanks me. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb design, easy to operate, plenty of space in colour screen. 
Cons:. Not built for accepting many accessories. 
Summary:. The Nano is the absolut middle between the iPod and the iPod Shuffle. It is a full featured iPod (colour screen, clickwheel, etc) while it uses flash memory (just like the Shuffle) and can accept very few accessories (such as voice recorders, FM receivers/transmitters etc).. Its size is the passport for everywhere: you can put it in your jeans pocket, shirt pocket, armband, wallet or hang it round your neck, and it's barely noticable. 500 or 1000 songs in this size, with a full-sized iPod functionallity makes the Nano a winner.. I'd like it though to be a little more like the Shuffle, which can instantly plug into a USB port for charging, data transfer or syncing, without the need for cables or other stuff.. 

$$;
Pros:. size, looks, lcd screen. 
Cons:. acrylic and chrome susceptible to scratches still, no FM. 
Summary:. it is so sexy to hold my black nano in hand. i'd stare at it a few seconds every time i look at it. the color lcd screen is great, and the ability to store photos and display album covers is a bonus. it's very thin, about 2/3 the size of a ipod shuffle. the battery life is 14 hours. my major gripe, as is with the full size ipod, is the acrylic and the chrome. i kinda wish apple had used anodized aluminum as they did with the mini's. but the upside is the nano looks much more attractive, almost a clothing accessory. the are no covers available at this time, but a bulky cover(yes, a rubberized shield would be relatively bulky compared to the size of the nano) would diminish nano's physical appeal so i have temporarily remedied this issue by keeping the plastic sleeve on, with a minimal amount of clear scotch tape. the writings on the sleeve rub of easily. the other downside is the lack of a FM radio. i hope they address this in the future. another very important thing, the sound quality; most of us know that the mini suffers from bass distortions, and this was my major concern, even over the acrylic and chrome surface, glad to report the nano has a push-pull design like the shuffle, and the bass is glorious. all in all, i think it's the best ipod thus far, combining beauty, quality, and convenience in a tiny package.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, full featured iPod, fully intergrated to iPod family. 
Cons:. Battery, Price. 
Summary:. I have read a lot of comments that it 'doesn't have a radio', is 'too small in storage size', 'doesn't support WMA', 'No voice Recording'.. This is marketed as an iPod, it is fully featured with a colour screen, excellent sound and by far the best user interface. It is a flash player and beats by a mile any flash player available. It also competes well with HD player in the same storage size range. Beats on features anything Sony and Creative have to offer. With time,apple will improve battery life and storage size and prices will drop (I hope!). I will be getting one soon, (Black or White, hard choice) It will not please everyone but 'One Tool Will Never Fit All'. 

$$;
Pros:. cool factor was high enough for me to think of getting it... and i already have a 4gb mini.. 
Cons:. the resale value for my 1st gen 4gb mini just went down.. 
Summary:. i had head the announcement and honestly wasn't expecting too much. my 4gb mini was a great match of form factor and capacity. anyway, i was at the apple store for other reasons and just happened by the nano table.. i wasn't truly impressed until i picked it up. it's just the right weight, it's size is small without feeling breakable or too petite, the color screen is snappy, and the black version is really REALLY cool.. the nano is clearly the best flash player ever made. i don't mean to come off as an apple apologist, but i can't help but think that the people giving this product 5s and 6s just aren't willing to give apple credit when it's due. the nano raises the bar and hints where apple will be heading next with the rest of the ipod family: thinner, more flash, better battery capacity.. expect to see the nano in lots of christmas stockings and on lots of gadget editors' top 10 lists.. 

$$;
Pros:. user friendly, beautiful, solid need i say more?. 
Cons:. i need more features whats going on APPLE!. 
Summary:. I rate for performance not brand, and how useful it has been so far. I have to say that I am getting sick of all the white people carry on their hands (iPods), the iPod mini was the alternative but know it is gone. bottom line you cant beat Apple and their is not much competition but crative is becoming a threat. there really arent many choices iPods rule the portable music world, I myself have my little buddy (40GB iPod Photo) which I had for several months my dad gave me a black iPod nano today and I have four words user friendly, beatiful and solid. Ive gotten used to my 40GB I dont have may songs but I got pictures, data, software I carry around. I have to say 250.00 for a 4GB player isn't to attractive not including tax I would prefer a sony PSP over this easy as far as value goes. my dream iPod nano is 8GB with FM Tuner and better headphones.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very small compared to all previous iPods. 
Cons:. Price. Easily scratched.. 
Summary:. Go to your local Apple Store and see it for yourself. Pictures don't do it any justice because it is TINY. It is so small that I felt that I could crush it in my hand by accident. Everything works as adverstised. Get $20 off if you're a university student. BTW: I overheard a couple girls ask if they could trade in their new minis for the nano.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing Screen, Just enough space for me (678 songs in my iTunes), Unbelievable Size, Great Battery, Phenominal Design. 
Cons:. The only thing I'm not sure about with the Nano is the headphone jack on the bottom. Right now it seems fine but time wil only tell. That and the damn thing doens't come with a clip.. 
Summary:. The Nano is a FAR better product than most are saying and I can confirm this because I actually own one. I have 678 songs in my iTunes library and the 4GB model will provide me with a great deal of space. The size is extrodinary.. For all the haters, try one before you bash it.. The only reason why I can't give it a 10 is because I'm not sure about the headphone jack on the bottom and it didn't come with a clip like the mini did.. 

$$;
Pros:. very fun to use.. 
Cons:. it would be nice to have a fm radio on it.. 
Summary:. great for everybody to use, with any kind of lifestyle, the price however could be a but cheaper. but besides this, is a top gadget!. 

$$;
Pros:. Super tiny size, vivid color screen, good bat. life. 
Cons:. glossy finish prone to finger prints &#38; scratches the headphne jack is on the bottom of the device weird placement. 
Summary:. This mp3 player is increddible you have to see it to believe it. Tiny size extreemly thin its just amazing. Just got mine yesterday and it works great. Color screen is extreemly vivid and projects accurate colors. Easily hooks up to itunes and I was able to easily sync my contacts from outlook and Mac my Mac Addressbook. Easily syncs my pictures from iPhoto. Overall one of the best mp3 players out there and the price is really good too. Well worth the $250 tag. This is my third 5th iPod and its the best one yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, flash, screen, photos, battery, click wheel. 
Cons:. headphone placement. 
Summary:. Ok - so to point out some serious issues to the haters - this is a flash player. There is 0, count them, 0 4GB flash players on the market - until now anyway. It might be a little pricey if you compare it to hard drive based systems but 2GB flash players retail for around 200 - what a surprise. Add on top of that that any person in school gets a discount. While it would be nice to see a mini with 8GB or 10GB this gem is amazing. The battery life listed is (having read reviews from people who actually have it) less than actual with one reviewer getting 20 hours... Essential add ons would be the lanyard/headphone combo that really makes the whole thing amazing. And to all the haters - I've had an FM tuner on an mp3 player and I thought it was quite possibly the most useless thing I've ever owned.... 

$$;
Pros:. 14 hour battery life, color screen, size. 
Cons:. 4gb tiny in comparison to monster 20-60gig regular ipods. 
Summary:. This is clearly the next generation of the ipod. All the sound quality, color screen and chic design of the regular ipod now compressed into an even smaller design. Though 4 GB MIGHT be too small for serious music listeners, come on, you'll run out of battery life (14 hours) before ever having to listen to the same song again. So alright, an 6 or 8 gb model would probably be more appreciated, boohoo, you'll be forced to choose only your most favorite 1000 songs from your music library.. 

$$;
Pros:. EVERYTHING. 
Cons:. Price,battery. 
Summary:. this is just best of the best what i have been waiting for it's very good for freshmen 4 school and am going out to buy it now!. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Light. 
Cons:. Low Capacity, No Video Support. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, Well designed, Decent Battery life and decent storage. 
Cons:. No video function (probably for the best) and has issues with random freezing. 
Summary:. The iPod nano is given a bit on an unfair rap in the CNET review in my opinion. For its size and weight 4 GiB isn't terrible for space. After all, between when you head out and 14 hours pass, 4 GiB is plenty of space for songs in between that time. The 14 hour batter is quite accurate even after a year of ownership. 14 hours isn't expressly appalling for the device, but more certainly wouldn't hurt it.. All in all, the nano is an excellent mp3 player and is best treated as a compact version of the standard iPod.. 

$$;
Pros:. i like this because it is perfect size for me i dont like bulky things.. 
Cons:. i dont like that the battery runs out fast and you have to constantly charge it.. 
Summary:. my opinion is that i really like this product it is very useful in alot of ways. I can hold pictures, play games, and listen to music. The bass system is good and i really like it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just a good camera. 
Cons:. hard to turn off. 

$$;
Pros:. looks,sound. 
Cons:. features prone to scratches. 
Summary:. ipod nano is a great mp3 player with amazing looks and gr8 sound quality.however it falls a bit short in the features department.. 

$$;
Pros:. -holds many songs -good sound quality -very small -. 
Cons:. -scratches easily -bad battery life -only comes with computer usb cable (no socket plug in) -. 
Summary:. I have had one for like a year now and i LOVE it! the only cons are 1)bad battery life (doesnt bother mwe too much) 2)only comes with a usb charger. when im somewhere without my computer, i cant charge my ipod!!! i believe u can buy one but they are rather pricy 3)scratches easily, i bought this skin 4 it thinking that would solve the problem but when i took the skin off, my ipod was all scratched up!!!! so the skin looked cool but scratched my ipod! overall the device was pretty good with its high sound quality, small pocket size, and large song capacity! i love my ipod for long car trips and plane rides. i also liked the fact that, unlike radio or cd, u can listen to the song u want, when u want! if i could give it a 8.5, i would.. 

$$;
Pros:. lots of them!!. 
Cons:. none of them!! Battery life-so so. 
Summary:. The Apple iPod nano is probably the best iPod there is. The iPod Video is too wide and bulgy. Besides, who needs video on their iPod anyway? The iPod shuffle 1st generation has no screen so you can't see which song is playing mext. The second generation is just too small! The iPod video holds too many songs. Who likes 20,000 songs anyway? The iPod shuffle 1st generation holds too little songs. Only 100, you'll run out of room fast. The second generation holds more, but not that many more (240 songs), you'll still run out of room quickly. What does that leave us with? The iPod nano. It has a super slim design, so it can easily fit into your pocket or bookbag. It holds up to 800 to 2000 songs. A good amount. I'm not so crazy about the battery life, but besides that, the iPod nano is great!. 

$$;
Pros:. nice and small, great color screen, easy user interface. 
Cons:. poor battery life. 
Summary:. Perfect for my needs and very easy to use. Just about any accessory you could want is available! Even people who are "technologically handicapped" can easily use an ipod with little instruction.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful design, excellent interface, nice sound.. 
Cons:. Battery, battery and battery. 

$$;
Pros:. Good sound, same look and feel. 
Cons:. no major new adds. 
Summary:. Very happy with the new battery life. Used to have to recharge all the time, now it's once/week.. No other major new features - but I would recommend the new 4 Gig ipod. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb design, scroll whell, I-tunes.. 
Cons:. Scratch prone.. 
Summary:. This is the best mp3 player in the ultracompact category. The 1000-song limit may not be right for you music maniacs but sure is right for most people. There is no doubt that the design is one of the best designs out there. Since it is scratch prone you might want to take care of it and putting a skin on it isn't a bad idea either. Other than that this is one the best mp3s out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light,thin,small and perfect sound quality.. 
Cons:. Quite durable and easy to scratch.. 
Summary:. When I bought the ipod nano I thought it would be great but its excellent,I use it every day and just cant stop using it even when I don't wanna listen to music I use it since it's so good,I have fun just scrolling across the menus!!!It is amazing!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. color screen, responsive click wheel. 
Cons:. scratches very easy, location of the headphone jack. 
Summary:. I actually bought the iPod nano for my wife for her birthday and I was amazed at how responsive the click wheel is. The screen is also a crisp bright display that is a pleasure to look at in all kinds of lighting conditions. The body (especially the screen) does tend to scratch a little too easily though. Overall an excellent product from Apple.. 

$$;
Pros:. so small, so seductive,so technologic, so want to have!. 
Cons:. so small that you can berly fill it on cloth, lack of battery expensive.. 
Summary:. ipod nano another technology to enjoy and feel music. It isnt a normal mp3 player now it brings photo display and album display and many other features. this mp3 player gives a new sensation to music, makes you want to hear music. ENJOY FROM TECHNOLOGY.... 

$$;
Pros:. attractive slim design, nice integration with iTunes, fast processor, great sound with zero skipping. 
Cons:. the battery. 
Summary:. I love listening to my new ipod Nano 4GB. I just love the attractive slim design. I appreciate the nice intigration with iTunes with the fast processor, crisp clean sound with zero skipping. I only have one problem to voice about it. The improved ipod battery is not improved enough in my humble opinion. My final solution for this only challenge was to pick up a batterygeek 100+ hour ipod battery. So far everything is sounding pretty good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely compact and small, great screen - colorful and bright, love the click wheel, sound quality is great. 
Cons:. VERY easy to scratch!. 
Summary:. Overall, this device works great. The only flaw is how easily it can scratch. You have to be extremely gentle with it,even holding it or setting down on a surface. It sounds annoying, and it is, but I suppose if you get a case or cover it should laster longer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Colored display, great sound, awesome flash memory device. 
Cons:. Headphones are terrible, the Apple iPod In-Ear Headphones should be included with the Nano. 
Summary:. I really love my 4 Gig Nano, but Apple is made themselves look extremly foolish, by not having any sleeves available, or other accessories ready for the release. That really is rather annoying and poor business on Apples part.. 

$$;
Pros:. Thiner, iPod Photo Capabilities, Colour Screen, Screen Lock, 4GB. 
Cons:. Click-Wheel, Low Battery Life. 
Summary:. In my opinion, the iPod Nano is just a smaller iPod Mini. Again, the cost is a little too much for so little, but it does retail for the same price as the Mini with more stuff, like the iPod Photo capabilities. All-in-all, if I had the money, it's a good buy!. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Colour Screen. 
Cons:. Price for accessories, Size of screen, Amount of memory, Battery life and charging via USB. 
Summary:. This a great product which I will be buying because my current iPod's click wheel won't work anymore, it's now a great new hard drive. The MAJOR con I see is that when I travel, say from Vancouver to Florida, what happens when the battery runs dry during the trip? More so, what happens when I'm IN Florida, very few hotels have computers and USB ports to charge with. 14 hours won't last too long. Maybe the wall charger for my 4G works with the nano?. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size, ease of use, good sound quality, no skipping. 
Cons:. Placement of earphone jack, sensitive volume control. 
Summary:. I bought the iPod Nano yesterday and overall am impressed with it (its my first ever Apple product).. Its quick and easy to set up and use. I felt the sound quality was very good considering its size. It also integrates well with iTunes so setting up playlists is easy.. The two biggest drawbacks are the placement of the headphone jack (at the bottom). Also, the volume control is sensitive so when I've picked it up, the volume changes sometimes. But neither of these are big issues.. The only feature I with they would have added was an FM tuner.. As for the size, I feel 4GB is plenty to handle 99% of my music library (I have about 950 songs).. While this is not my first mp3 player (I also own the Dell 20GB Jukebox), I think this will be my player of choice due to its size, no skipping, and easy music player integration.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just look at the thing. 
Cons:. Aparently iTunes is a Problem. 
Summary:. Im not quite sure what to think of the nano anymore. I originally owned a 5GB Dell Digital Jukebox and it worked really well. What really caught my eye with the nano is its incredible design. Im just worried im going to loose it, its so small. My Nano is on the way as i have sold my Dell player for $150, not a bad deal considering its a year old.. 

$$;
Pros:. attractive design, great display, powerful processor and fast system performance. 
Cons:. short battery life. 
Summary:. I absolutely love my new iPod Nano. The small dimensions and light weight are ideal for my frequent travels. Also, I love the fact that it works so seamlessly with iTunes and iTunes Music Store. The only thing it is missing is a longer battery life. My solution to this problem was easily resolved though by simply picking up a new 100+ hour per charge external lithium battery pack from batterygeek. I would highly recommend the new Apple iPod Nano to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. stylish and cool. 
Cons:. FM stereo would've been nice. 
Summary:. PREFACE: I do not own this but have seen in person: That said; this.... could possibly be the coolist Ipod yet... My only knocks:. 1.I wish it had the FM stereo feature for use at the gym; my gym broadcasts TV via FM channel (another reviewer posted same wish)- not a deal breaker though. 2.It scratches fairly easy - not sure why but my buddy returned his for another within 3 days of purchase -- maybe he cleaned his with sand paper?. I do want to knoow.... Do you have to use Itunes to download mp3? I use Yahoo music engine which allows unlimited downloads in mp3 format. I would hate to think that this device only works with Itunes.. 

$$;
Pros:. compact, attractive, color screen. 
Cons:. THEY KILLED THE MINI!!!. 
Summary:. I don't have a nano, but my personal opinion is that they should have just added it to the family of ipod instead of replacing the mini. I think, yes, it is a stylish player, but the mini, being the most popular player on the market, was a wonder product. I got mine only a month or so ago and it is surgically attached to my ear. It looks as if the nano will be a waste of money for A LOT OF PEOPLE because of the fact it is so small. They will lose it. i know i probably would. A note to apple, i would have kept the mini and added the nano to the family. The nano does look good tho!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very small, but very clear legible screen. 
Cons:. Already scratched. 
Summary:. I finally broke down and bought one. I have pulled over 400 songs from my old CD's and I have 1.6 gig left. I would have expected more from the ads. Easy it was. It is pleasure to use and listen to, although you absolutely need different ear buds.. I am disapointed that I scratch it already, by putting it into that little pocket in my jeans, like Job's did in the intro. Need to get a skin cover as soon as I can.. I am very happy other than that.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, flash memory, screen.. 
Cons:. No FireWire; black finish is a fingerprint magnet. Still would like a built-in FM tuner.. 
Summary:. I've never owned an iPod Mini, nor have I ever had any real desire to. My 40GB 3G and 4G took care of the HD side of things, and I could never see the need for me to settle for only 4GBs or later 6GBs of HD storage. So from my standpoint I don't view the nano as a replacement to either of the Mini models.. However, I DO have a 1GB iPod Shuffle, and that IS one device that sorely needs replacing. Its minimalism is a throwback to the earliest days of MP3 flash players, except done in Apple White. After living with and enjoying iRivers flash players, using the Shuffle was abrupt culture shock, and I do mean that in a bad way. Apple's first gen flash units are TOO simplistic, IMO.. Enter the nano, the flash player that Apple should've released in the first place. Though wider in footprint to the Shuffle, it's thinner and does a whole lot more, even if my occasional need for radio is still left unfulfilled. After three days of ownership and use, I'm completely sold on the concept. Whether the Mini is gone or not to me it doesn't matter; I look at the nano as the near perfect AAC flash player, something the minimal Shuffle never could achieve.. The nano isn't perfect; to me it doesn't sound as rich and textured as the 4G, though it's still quite satisfactory. The small click wheel is usable but sometimes seems more jerky in operation, especially when compared to the full-sized iPods. I'm still undecided about the bottom-mounted headphone jack: how do you listen to the thing with cans if you use a dock, for instance. The color screen looks great, but in use it's really all about the music, baby; viewing pictures on a tiny nano really make about as much sense as music on a cell ph...oh, never mind...you know what I mean. Considering how great images look on my PSP or even my BlackBerry 7100t, it's lost on me why anyone would consider the tiny screen of the nano as a viable viewer platform. I suppose you can if you must, but WHY?. But for music the nano is a breeze to use, very easy on the eyes, and will allow me to use it in dirty and dusty places my HD-based iPods would NEVER dare to go. And it works with my AAC-based library. Now if Apple would work on a built-in radio and work out a means for a user-replaceable battery, the concept would be as good as it gets. But if you got the money now, want a super-lightweight, high quality DAP and if you especially use Apple-format files, it's a definite high recommend.. 

$$;
Pros:. its pretty obvious. 
Cons:. metal back similar to the one on the big ipod (scratches easily). 
Summary:. best flash player ever,. 1 major flaw; they didnt use the scrath resistant casing found on the ipod mini. Instead, they used the metal back (found on big ipod) that gets scratched like an itchy buttocks. Why didn't they use the nice scrath-resistant casing found on the mini?. 

$$;
Pros:. color screen, interface, etc.. 
Cons:. headphone placement. 
Summary:. while i think its a great thing to get if youve never owned a ipod (kids), ive noticed that it is very cumbersome to carry a cell phone, car keys, wallet, pack of gum, a good point-and-shoot camera, AND mp3 player in one's pants. Also, i noticed that i never really listen to all my songs in my library. I usually listen to only 5-10 songs at a time, due to the fact that the songs are usually new. Otherwise i stop listening to a song once i get tired of it and listened to it too many times. Thats why i'm simply waiting to invest in a samsung z700 phone, which is a cell phone, mp3 player, 3 mega pixel camera, and more all bundled into one package. It's either a z700 or some other awesome cell that will inevitably come out. just something to think about.. 

$$;
Pros:. SMALL, colour screen, click wheel, games, calender, clock, screen lock, great for jogging. 
Cons:. no FM, only 2/4 gig options, weird headphone places, price,. 
Summary:. This player is the next big thing!. 

$$;
Pros:. looks, color screen, small size!. 
Cons:. price! 6 GB would be better. 
Summary:. I have read the reviews and people either love the nano or hate it. I just ordered the black 4GB nano and cant wait to have it my hands!. For me, while pricey, its perfect- I have an older 3rd generation 15GB ipod with 8 GB of music on it - but it has neither the color screen or capacity to hold photos, unlike the nano. I fully intend on filling up that one with to its 15 GB capacity but with the nano, I can store up to 2,5000 photos (or more, cant remember the exact amount) and/or up to 1,000 songs. I will use the nano at the gym or when traveling.. In one sense, the 4GB nano would be nice if it were a compromise between the mini and the other larger memory versions and be offered with 6GB, but I think the 4 GB is totally fine- 1,000 songs at my immediate disposal and 14 hours of battery life as opposed to the 8 I currently get with my 3rd gen ipod, is a real plus.. 

$$;
Pros:. sleek, small, price hasn't changed compared to ipod mini, color screen. 
Cons:. it copied creative on its name(nano). 
Summary:. apple could get sued by creative for using the word nano on the name of the ipod. it is really nice though. the accessories are awsome too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good player, sounds good, looks good. 
Cons:. Too much hype, can't connect to rhapsody, napster, yahoo, etc. Don't like the circle navigation.. 
Summary:. I bought a refurbished 4 GB ipod nano because my mother (bless her heart, she doesn't really understand these things.) bought me an ihome bedside ipod dock, which of course is not compatible with my sansa. I will say that the ipod is a much better player than my sansa m250, but for a lot more money, and with no good, legal, way to get music online. You have to use itunes or emusic, etc. I always have been kind of envious of the ipod and the wealth of accessories out there available. However, I get most of my music from Yahoo because I don't have to pay for each song that I put on my player, just the monthly fee. I think many people are sheep and want the hip product, I don't know. Anyways, it is a great product, just not worth the hype. Do some research and maybe get a creative, toshiba, sandisk or iriver. I only briefly used a creative zen micro 6GB a while back, but I like the up and down interface a lot better than the circle on the ipod. Toshiba with the cross, looks good also. I just don't like the ipod's interface.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great design, easy to use, good battery life. 
Cons:. Screen scratches, should be equipped with a radio. 
Summary:. The Nano's small and great for running and it holds tons of music, which I like. But I used to have an iRiver, which had a radio and I really miss that. I can't listen to NPR on the bus in the morning, or tune into the TVs at the gym. iPod really need to have a radio in them to make them complete.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek, compact design...hince the name: Nano. Flash!. 
Cons:. Unless i haven't figure out the feature to this there is no light in the click wheel, its all finger printy after i took it out of the package. 
Summary:. So after every friend in my circle went to purchase the nano after its release. I had to be damn sure this is $300 i would spend my money on. I looked at all the other brand like Zen and Sony. I soley purchased the nano for its name. Sorry to see the product is in need for some super tweeks. Oviously it is going under super reviewers with high expectations, which it should. If you are looking to purchase you need to look at some factors. the high price of the assessories. Believe me when i say you'll need to purchase a case imediatly.$40 for plastic is that not over priced?. If you are a student you can receive an educational discount at apple.ca I paid 279 for a 4GB.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent navigation and good sound quality. 
Cons:. Scratches all over the cover and the screen appears to have cracks. 
Summary:. Looks very good initially but if you put it in your pocket all the time, make sure to buy a cover other wise it will have scratches all over it within a week.. 

$$;
Pros:. iPod Family, Dimensions, Size, Capacity, "Cool Factor", Ease to Use. 
Cons:. No Removable Battery, FM Tuner, Subscription Service. 
Summary:. Overall, the Nano will definitely be the new thing to have, in terms of an MP3 player. Its size and portability add to how useful this flash based player is. My only question is this: Is the iPod Nano considered to be a fourth generation iPod, or the birth of the fifth? If not the fifth, when will we see this fifth generation of iPods and what new features will they introduce? Discuss.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, color LCD, view photos, click wheel (still the best interface), flash instead of hard driver. 
Cons:. File format limitations (same as all Apple units), memory capacity, battery life, headphone jack location. 
Summary:. I will preface this review with the fact that I own a Creative Zen Micro and love it but very nearly bought an iPod Mini. The release of this product prompted me to visit an Apple store to check it out. It is an overall improvement from the Mini but still falls short, in my opinion.. Pros:. Size...absolute best feature. This thing is super small yet offers nearly the same memory options as microdrive players. A third of the weight of my Zen Micro or a Mini.. Color display is nice. Photos viewing also nice but lets be honest, not the reason you buy this device.. Flash memory--always better than hard drive if you can get the same memory capacity.. Cons:. File format limitations. This is the biggest deterent for me. My entire library is WMA. It offers better sound at same bitrate (or same sound at lower bitrate, your choice). Thus, you can save more music in this format. Didn't really want to re-rip or convert my entire collection in MP3 or AAC format.. Also, while i-Tunes is great, it is your only choice. This was the dealbreaker for me.. Memory capacity is great....for a flash player. For many of us, 20 GB is not needed but 1-2 GB isn't enough. I want 6-8 GB and this player took a step in the wrong direction.. Battery life--compared to all players, the nano's battery life is mediocre but compared to other flash players it's pretty awful. In fact, most hard drive players can probably match the nano and some blow it away (Sony).. Sound quality is OK but iPod are traditionally midpack here and the nano is no different. There are many better sounding players out there.. Last, though not a huge flaw, placing the headphone jack on the bottom is going to limit the use of some iPod accessories. Not sure about the motivation here by Apple.. I don't care about FM or voice recording in my DAP and the reception of FM in most players sucks anyhow (why would you want to listen to horrible sounding radio signals instead of digital audio anyways?), so excluding those features doesn't impact my rating.. Overall, it's a damn cool player. If you currently use MP3 format and don't need more than 4 GB, this is easily the best player available for you. Otherwise, you should shop around to compare an see what is most important to you.. 

$$;
Pros:. style, capacity. 
Cons:. iTunes, price, functionality, damage, wheel. 
Summary:. way overpriced, decent product. iTunes sucks.. 

$$;
Pros:. very cute, good sound, nice display, easy playlist creation.. 
Cons:. horrible battery, not enough memory for the price, pictures don't show too good, not too customizable.. 
Summary:. I honestly don't find this to be a good enough mp3 player to be priced this high. I go to school for nothing more than four and a half hours, and i barely use the player, it's always dead by time I get home. Also I don't like the fact that itunes is the only thing that can change the files on it.. I honestly wouldn't recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. holds just enough songs and photos. 
Cons:. Throws baby fits at me. 
Summary:. I bought an ipod nano for myself for Christmas. I loaded it up with music copied from my cd collection. Sometimes it starts skipping like a cd player would. It isn't the song it is the ipod. Also I have had it lock up on me more than once. The only other problem would be trying to select something while in a car or anything else that moves you around. It is very touchy and you hit about 5 other songs before you hit the one you want.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of Use w/ I-Tunes, and Fast Downloading. 
Cons:. Menu Dial is more frustrating than Mouse Pads on first gen Lap Tops!. 
Summary:. Watch Out for Microsofts' wireless version coming soon!!.

$$;
Pros:. looking good. 
Cons:. storage capacity for the money. 
Summary:. I was not sure for awhile, did a lot of thinking about the cost versus its storage capacity, but ended up buying one, and I like it, however, now that I already own one, I'm currently on a new dilemma, this time about my next move, a digital music server or something like it, I've read about the sonos (www.sonos.com), found a new one called symphony olive (www.olive.us) and was hoping someone would have feedback to share on these or something else?. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, design, photos, easy of use.. 
Cons:. Missing: FM, voice recording, WMA and OGG support. 
Summary:. As is typical with closed source companies like Apple, innvoative, great design but poor cost/performance.. I can (and will) buy a Creative Muvo Slim 1GB flash player that has a rechargeable-via-USB battery, has FM, has voice recording, and supports superior WMA and OGG encoding.. The price: $110 shipped. http://tinyurl.com/bus5s. BOTTOM LINE: nice but overpriced. 

$$;
Pros:. small, light, thin iPod. 
Cons:. no WMA DRM, voice recorder, or FM, short battery life, small storage.. 
Summary:. I won't be buying this because it doesn't have WMA DRM capabilities.. voice recorder is also important to me.. still, the nano is very tempting.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cool looking, easy. 
Cons:. no FM radio, pricy, and no video. 
Summary:. I used to have one of these, but when my neighbor dropped and broke it, I decided to go with something new...Don't get me wrong, this is a great little player, but I like my 4GB iRiver Clix better.... 

$$;
Pros:. Plenty of memory space. 
Cons:. No radio, weak battery, delicate hardware, BAD customer service.. 
Summary:. The Ipod Nano may be one of the best MP3 players out there but that still doesn't say much for it. The 4GB has been enough memory for me and the user interface is ok. However: The battery absolutely sucks, it scratches and looks like it's 100 years old within a week, it lacks an AM/FM tuner and the optional attachments for that are too cumbersome to bother with, it is not well designed for exercise (something many Ipod users like to do while listening to music), it is easily damaged and the controls are hard to handle while running. AND it has a tendency to just DIE for no reason and will not be resuscitated!! Although Apple will fix or replace it within a year it is very difficult to actually take your Ipod to one of their stores! They make you set up an appointment just to drop it off. Appointments can only be made the same day and fill up by mid-morning. So, you have to plan your life around this and get up at the crack of dawn just to make an appointment to show a technician your broken Ipod. There is NO drop-off service. And what happens if your Ipod breaks after a year? I guess you're out of luck.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks nice, small, good sound. 
Cons:. Scratches soo easily. 
Summary:. Ok so I've saved up my money and I went to the apple store and bought a iPod Nano, i bring it home and put my music in it. The nano is nice but you have to take a gamble. Yes after just 1 days use, it breaks, the screen cracks. Soo the nano is nice but you have to hope you dont get a broken one. Great work Mac you made a horrible mp3 player. 

$$;
Pros:. the nano (10!). 
Cons:. the money....so heres something different! (5!). 
Summary:. I love the nano, but I didn't pay any money for mine. All I did was I traded in CDs I already had for it. Ipodmeister is a service that takes your CD collection and depending on the number of CD's you have you can get different sorts of ipods. If you don't like the nano, 300 CDs will get you a 30 gb photo/video ipod; 600 will get you a 60 gb photo/video ipod; etc. Not only that but you get a free cable to link your ipod to your stereo so you will continue to enjoy the same sound you like. And finally, you get back up DVDs of all of your music incase something goes wrong.. 

$$;
Pros:. unlike creative the sound quality of bass is very good. 
Cons:. its nearly perfect but the sound quality is not. 
Summary:. the looks of ipon nano is great but the sound quality is not coz it has no custom equalizer like creative you can choose what sound you like unlike ipod is not, the bass is not that strong im not satisfied with that. 

$$;
Pros:. Click wheel, screen, sound quality. 
Cons:. Everything in my review. 
Summary:. The ipod nano is a great product, but I am currently having problems with what I have been seeing. I have noticed that they scratch VERY easily (all too easily, and I don't know how the people who were testing this thing overlooked that). My friend recently bought one and during a meeting, she placed it in her front pocket. She sat down, and the ipod SNAPPED! I have seen that they are not very durable, so, anybody who is active who carries these ipods, be aware. These are not sturdy MP3's. I suggest to avoid these casualties by:. 1. Buy cases or armbands. These will protect from scratching and snapping. I hope.. 2. Don't carry while being very active. These have a tendency to get dropped or scratched OR snapped. Or all of the above.. 3. DON'T BUY ONE AT ALL!!! The ipod 5th generation (otherwise known as ipod videos) are not much more expensive than the 4gb ipod nano. Buy one of those instead. They are sturdier and bigger (which means easier to handle) and also have good video and audio quality. Or, try another brand of MP3 player! I don't think ipod has any other ideas to do anything else with an MP3. Try lookin into Creative, Phillips (I recently purchased a phillips gogear 6gb MP3 player for 198.99 and it is exellent quality.), or Dell. Try something new for a change people!. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, simplicity, form, looks. 
Cons:. Scratches like crazy!. 
Summary:. If you don't know by now, this iPod scratches ludicrously easily. I treated mine like a baby, cleaned the smudges off with a microfibre cloth, yet it scratched. This is absurd, I have had sunglasses, PSP, mobile phones, Walkmans, nothing else has scratched so easily. Do yourself a favour; don't buy this product until Apple has rectified the problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Another great looking player from apple. 
Cons:. Sound quality is equal to a $50 flash player. 
Summary:. Yes it is amazingly slim and cool looking and 4gb is a lot of storage for its size. I might even buy it just because its that cool.(I tried one at a retail store). However all ipod really needed (in my opinion ) is to sound better ......I have no idea what chip or software would make it sound better ,but that would honestly do it for me.I have owned 2 Ipods and sound quality and volume was always dissapointing and the nano also sounds weak also.....i wont even mention itunes but that will always be a negative. 

$$;
Pros:. Color Screen on such a small device. 
Cons:. Just about everything else. 
Summary:. Ok I have been reading everyones reviews and see how people go back and forth about this, obviously those who like apple and those who dont. The bottom line is this player is garbage, its made by apple, its features are the same as the first ipod they are not moving forward they just make things smaller, just like their computer line. ANY COMPANY CAN CREATE A PLAYER OF THIS SIZE IF THEY WANTED TO, but it would be to expensive, as the nano, it would lack features, as the nano , and finally who would want a player this small, is this made for anorexic people, what are they trying to do here, and who in the world has a 2 GB library of music, and if you do use cds mp3 players are not for you, so unless apple makes a useful product the creative zen is the best product it has the best sound quality and interface, and trust me i have been though about 6 ipods all of which are GARBAGE...so all you little ipod lovers can just have your little libaries to put on your little players while real men and of course women use real mp3 players....... End. 

$$;
Pros:. Small (in size). 
Cons:. Small (in capacity). 
Summary:. If you're going to throw down $250 on an MP3 player, why in God's name would you make it a 4GB flash player? For the same price, you can get a perfectly-good 20GB player that still fits in your pocket. (Check out the Archos XS 202.) When this player costs $50, *then* come tell me what a great deal it is.. 

$$;
Pros:. small with no moving parts. 
Cons:. no radio or recording options. Many ipod accessories are useless with this device.. 
Summary:. It is a nice small player, but it is misisng radio and line in recording. I'll stick with iaudio.. 

$$;
Pros:. color screen and flash memory. 
Cons:. Do I really want to pay $250 when the mini of the same price offers more storage?. 
Summary:. I'm sold with the color screen but, eventually, all the future generations of the iPod series will sport this feature. Because of the size, (and current lack of accessories at the time of this writing) the Nano won't be a digital photographer's companion for storing pics (most will have a laptop or other storage medium with them, but that's beside the point).. The only real selling point is for those people wanting flash based memory and super compact size than something mini or hard drive based. This Nano looks like something that can be easily lost if one is not careful.. Now if Apple only offered user accessable replaceable battery support for this Nano, this would rate as one of the hardest mp3 players in the market to be challenged.. 

$$;
Pros:. looks nice, i guess. 
Cons:. pricey, still no extra capabilities. 
Summary:. Im confused. isnt this just basically an ipod mini with a color screen? with this coming out do they still have ipod minis? and if they dont, i think apple went in the wrong direction. the 2 gb ipod nano is $199, while the 4 gb mini is also $199....so thats $50 for a color screen. id pas the color screen and take the 2 extra gb, thanks.. 

$$;
Pros:. tiny, no extra money for black version :). 
Cons:. same product. 
Summary:. First of all it's an old design. 4th gen ipod but smaller. how come they said its an entirely new design??? And during the presentation the player was compared to sony network walkman hw-hd5. They forgot only one thing: hd5 is a 20 gig player, but still its almost the same size as a nano. It comes to my mind that apple ran out of ideas. The design has not been changed and they couldn't even come up with their own name for the player.. 

$$;
Pros:. flash memory, color screen. 
Cons:. low memory, pricey. 
Summary:. its a step up from the mini, i think. color screen, 4GB for $250. Wait, thats how much the old mini's cost. oh well, its really just a flash version of the color ipod. if you need more space, the color ipod is the way to go. its not like any ipod is bulky anyway..
