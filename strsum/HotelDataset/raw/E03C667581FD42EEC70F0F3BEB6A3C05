first time i have stayed here on a last minute booking , i knew some of the reviews were not good but decided to try it for 9 hours for just £25 .
its ok for a quick stay , a bit scruffy looking in my single room , curtains were thin & old looking but it was very clean , shower was good , free tea & coffee & biscuits .
bit of a musty smell but the electric heater soon fixed that .
the reception staff were great and they sell cold tinned beer even at 2am which i was glad of .
24 hour reception too for us late people : - ) i would consider staying again at this price for a few hours .
if you prefer something more modern & a bit more luxurious you should find somewhere else at the extra cost .
there was a coach of chinese tourists staying so it must he popular for some reason .
the parking was great and safe .
its very close to man utd , old trafford and chester road shops .
i wo n't slag it off as it served my purpose , other reviews on here are pretty fair imho but think of the price , length of stay and proximity to your events .
not a good review by me but honest and accurate , i was n't annoyed with my choice as i knew in advance what to expect , if you are happy with this then you wo n't he disappointed either , its a . . .
