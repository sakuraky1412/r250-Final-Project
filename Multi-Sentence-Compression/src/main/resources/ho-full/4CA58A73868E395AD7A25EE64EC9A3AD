we stayed at grey gables for one night while touring ireland .
when researchjing options for ennis none sounded like stand outs and we chose grey gables on the grounds of location and reasonable price .
the location is very good - 5 minutes walk and you are in the centre of an attractive historic town .
i think on price grey gables is an option because places in ennis seemed to charge a fair amount for b & b but compared to many beautiful b & bs we have stayed at around ireland , for similar prices , grey gables didnt really feel like value for money .
there was no wifi in the room - which given i needed to do some work was inconvenient .
we had room 7 and it is tucked away in a corner with possibly the worst wifi coverage in the house .
we could also hear a fair degree of movement in the room above .
i suggest if you stay you ask to have a room other than 7 .
the b & b itself is clean and tidy but it has a strange mix of tiles and wooden flooring and carpeting throughout .
it does n't feel cohesive or comfortable .
other minor issues , but they add up , were a very poor old tv with limited channel choice , tea making facilities are out in a corridor corner not in your room and there were only a couple of hard to access power points , a nuisance when you eed to . . .
