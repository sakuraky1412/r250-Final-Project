3 quot  widescreen display was a bonus .
Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .
The bad ,  My unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .
It also can display and speak many languages .
The Garmin has a nice 3d display .
The 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the arrow .
Well when I saw that the 255W had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner I jumped at it .
The 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit .
Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .
But is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .
