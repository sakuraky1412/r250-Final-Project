i am a newbie , but did my homework .
i is evaluating all the black friday offerings for entry level gps units .
i quickly narrowed it down to magellan 3100 , magellan 1200 , and garmin c330 .
i read the reviews , analyzed the reviews , compared specs , and read the user manuals .
no to little information is available on the magellan roadmate 1200 , so i asked the circuit city salesboy .
unfortunately , he knew less than i did .
so i bought the wally world $ 128 + special knowing that i would not get text to speech and lat / long coordiantes -LRB- magellan hs the lat / long capability -RRB- .
i is not prepare for how good this unit is .
it is ready out of the box and is usable without reading the instruction -LRB- generally a last resort anyway -RRB- i road tested it in hilly country which generally has poor satellite service and never lost the connection .
i deliberately made false turns .
the unit tries to make corrections too quickly if you do n't take the first correction , the second correction appears to be better .
do not expect for it to give you directions out of the mall parking lot .
but otherwise if you enjoy reading maps and taking trips then this is a point a to b -LRB- and in between -RRB- wonder .
this is such a great value that i rushed out and bought a second one for my wife .
now if i could just get it to understand that i already agreed to the eula .
you could n't get lost even if you wanted to .
it works right out of the box .
i took a trip to ok a few days after i purchased this .
i just typed in the address i wanted to go to and with a touch on the screen it gave me turn by turn directions .
it even talks to you and tells you when to turn in enough time , if you happen to be in the wrong lane for a turnoff .
if you happen to miss a turn this will recalculate to put you back on track .
when i arrived in ok , it took right to the address i typed in .
it even brought me to an outback steak house which i had no idea where one is and had not seen one on the way down .
it brought me right to the door .
amazing .
i also programed it to find me an italian restaurant and it showed me a list of them right on the screen .
it 's like having your own personal guide to where ever you want to go .
this also gives you the street names shown on the screen as you approach them and also shows you where you are on the screen .
it has everything programed in it ; places of interest , restaurants with any kind of food you want from fast food to fancy places , recreation spots , attractions , hospitals , auto services , transit , shopping , entertainment , parking , lodging , fuel stops , and gives you the real time of your arrvial .
it also keeps track of how fast you were going , top speed , average speed on road time and stop time .
this unit also has a battery indicator to let you know how much power is left .
the battery can not be overcharge while it 's pluged into your power source .
there is no replacement battery for it .
this unit is the greatest since hot apple pie with chocolate ice cream if anyone ever gets lost using this garmin street pilot , i 'll give them $ 1 , 000 .
it 's all that it 's suppose to be and more .
i should have had this along time ago .
i can not say enough for this system .
so easy to use , i have v8 on my , v9 is coming out this summer some time .
i use this to go any where and i 'm telling you i never got lost .
it takes about a minute to program a address , it does 'n speak out the street names dut it tells you the street name on top of what street you are in and what steet turn you going to be taking , but it speaks out everything else like turn is coming up , lef , right ect this is the best and so easy to use buy .
i 've had my c330 for about two weeks .
i have taken one long -LRB- 700 mile -RRB- trip and many short ones .
only once has it called a wrong turn , and i think it is because a freeway off ramp is recently removed .
the c330 recalculated and got me where i wanted to go i have found a few local restaurants that are missing from the pois , but most of them are in the database .
many reviewers complained about the inability to enter vias on the route .
the latest software update , which i downloaded and installed with no problems , added the ability to enter a via and then continue on to your original destination .
after stopping at each via , such as a gas station or restaurant , you can input another .
i found it very easy to do , and very handy .
this unit is everything that people say it is .
it worked right out of the box .
i tried to trick it by turning in different directions ; but the unit got me back on track .
my wife and i visited friends the day after we got the gps .
i let my wife program it and she is amazed at how easy it is to use .
after leaving our friends house we hit the food icon , and it directed us to a popeyes , which we had n't eaten at in years .
last week for thanksgiving we went to kentucky and visited our daughters in laws .
they live on a country road in a small town .
my wife did n't think the unit would find the house , but it found the house with no problems .
i 've had the unit for three weeks , and have not had any problems .
i rate this unit a solid ten .
i have read many reviews and some complain about lack of features or poor screen but these are not true .
everyone complains about how hard it is to mark a current location .
just mark it as home and then edit home in the favorits .
that is not so hard .
people want to mark a bunch of waypoints but who ever does that .
can not set up a complicated route , who wants to .
this just does everything you really want to do well .
i will say the first unit i bought is defective .
when i turned it on it said can not open maps .
this is a known problem and the unit had to be returned .
second unit worked as soon as i turned it on .
no need to load a map or do anything .
this is the best gps system that i have ever bought .
i does everything that you want .
on other gps systems i 've tried , it didnt even know where the address is where is was going .
but this system far exceeded my expectations .
it has a great audio system , preinstalled maps that can be updated on the garmin .
com website , making it even better .
it has a detour icon that you can click on while you are driving if traffic is heavy and need to get somewhere quick and it will plan a nect better route .
excellent product , a lifesaver really .
a + + + + + in my book .
i 've been using this device for over 6 months at this point .
i have used it on several long distance trips and vacations in different areas of the country -LRB- in rental cars -RRB- .
it 's driving directions have always been accurate , and i have never been led astray .
recent firmware upgrades -LRB- free -RRB- , through the garmin website , have added additional points of interest and decreased the time waiting for the unit to acquire a sattelite signal -LRB- not that i ever thought that it is long -RRB- .
for the price , and simplicity of the unit , it is fantastic the downside , there is no built in traffic monitor -LRB- separate purchase for this unit -RRB- ; however , this omission keeps the price down -LRB- and the units i have used with traffic updates did not help that much -RRB- when planning a trip , you can only add one detour at a time -LRB- ie stopping at a tourist attraction , hotel , etc . -RRB-
however ; this is a minor detail some minor annoyances it will repeatedly tell you to stay left/right on a highway as to avoid getting off/on at merge/diverge points .
it is probably unnecessary to do this as most of us can follow the road sign that tells us which highway we are on .
again , only a minor point secondly , when driving in areas that you are extremely familiar , it will often guide you in a direction that you would likely not go -LRB- ie your own familiarity with different routes is usually more efficient -RRB- , but even if you follow the unit 's directions , you will get to your destination maps are updated on a yearly basis from garmin for purchase .
i have not purchased the 2009 map -LRB- about $ 70 -RRB- as i have not found any problems with the current maps overall , when i is looking for gps units , i wanted voice to text , easy to read/see screen , and accuracy .
all the other bells and whistles , i can do without .
altogether , i have not been dissappointed .
do you want a rock solid basic gps then this is it .
it works great and is very easy to use .
i just got a tomtom go 510 and it can not hold a candle to the c330 garmin is extremely easy to use .
everything is laid out logically and right where you want it you will not find bluetooth , ipod controls or other extras , but it is very good at being a gps .
i am happy with this gps device .
i purchased it recently and found that the maps were old i called garmin and told them that this is a recent purchase .
they sent me free update of the maps -LRB- 4 5 weeks backorder -RRB- .
december , 2007 .
started with the garmin nuvi 200 for about a half day and got frustrated with it , and took it back .
then tried the tomtom one 3rd generation and never made it out of the store parking lot .
so sticking with the old saying 3rd times a charm , we 'll it was .
got the garmin streetpilot c330 and have not looked back .
plenty of gps for someone wanting simplicity and ease of use .
for the price there is bar none , no better gps receiver , with the possible exception of the garmin 200 -LRB- which is the newer version of the c330 -RRB- the poi database is extensive , you can search by category , name , spelling , proximity to your current location , to another location , to your current route , or to your destination .
the poi 's are complete with phone numbers -LRB- which is great if you are looking say for a hotel or restaurant , you can call to make a reservation , etc .
the garmin c330 if far better at calculating the fastest route between two points than any other gps navigator .
i recently took a 600 mile trip and it calculated my arrival time within 1 minute of my actual arrival time not bad if you are on a budget but want a decent gps system , do not look any further .
the garmin c330 , with the possible exception of the garmin 200 is the best for less than $ 300 .
this is a great dedicated automotive gps .
i does n't have an mp3 player , picture viewer or bluetooth , but why do you need to pay extra for those when all you want is to get directions to your destination .
it gives directions such as in point three miles , turn left instead of turn left onto narragansett avenue .
this means it does n't need to synthesize the directions either , so you get a smooth recorded voice with tonal inflections rather than sounding like you are taking directions from the noaa weather radio for getting from here to there , it is great .
like any other gps -LRB- even the dedicated built in ones from the rental car companies -RRB- , it does not always get you there in the most logical or shortest route .
it does not beat a thomas guide -LRB- with a human planner -RRB- or even a tripple a map , but it does get you to your destination .
since most companies ' data bases are the same , you can pay double for more bells and whistles , but it wo n't get you there any quicker by the way , it does work on airlines , just do not try to put a destination into it or it will be spending all its time recalculating g , but it is handy seeing where you are as you are flying accross the country and the batteries do last a very long time i got mine refurbished at fry 's for $ 200 and luckily paid the extra $ 15 for an extended warranty -LRB- which i usually never buy -RRB- .
two months later , the batteries refused to take a charge and it is good only when plugged in .
fry 's made an even exchage and i is back in buisness .
luckily , i also backed up my favorite locations onto an sd card and is able to transfer them to the new c330 .
i have had this unit for about a year now and i love it .
i have had great success with the navigation and am especially happy with the detour feature that has gotten me arround traffic and road construction countless times .
some people have complained that it does n't read out the street names when giving the turn by turn directions , but the name of the street is always displayed boldly at the top of the screen and i have never found this to be a problem .
i have found the routes it gives to be great , often times taking you on what seems to be an odd route that will turn out to be a great short cut or at the least the fastest way to get somewhere .
i also like all the pre programmed locations that make it easy to find food , services , and points of interest especially when in an area you are not fammiliar with .
i do have to say there are times when the pre set locations -LRB- especially gas stations -RRB- are no longer in business or are no longer in that location but that is to be expected and will hopefully be taken care of with an update .
i bought this gps because of price and only going after base level needs .
i would love to be able to afford all of the whistles and bells but really just needed something to get me to and from safely and accurately .
i have only owned it for a week and am not a technological genius .
it loaded right from the box .
i have already taken it to nj and to the middle of nowhere in md visiting a friend .
i had no cell phone reception but my satellite stayed strong .
so far i definitely recommend it for others who feel directionally challenged without wanting to spend too much money .
i think that the product is and excellent product for use in australia .
the only problem is that it does not assist in diverting congestions and giving us an option to take better routes .
i have a garmin ique m5 pocket pc gps unit .
at the time it is the top dual unit on the market .
however , my parents -LRB- seniors -RRB- recently purchased the garmin streetpilot c330 and i absolutely love .
its perfect for them .
for anyone who is on the fence and are apprehensive purchasing a gps unit , the c330 is for you .
computer savvy not required .
happy navigating .
extremely easy to use out of the box without having to read the manual .
touch screen is very responsive and large enough to use easily .
after 2 months , unit has found every location i have entered , even some down dirt/gravel roads in remote locations purchased chip with maps for england .
unit worked very well , accurately leading me to each location , whether in rural areas or downtown london i like the automatic mode that changes screen display after sundown .
keeps the display easy to read only downsides are that some points of interest no longer exist , especially in the restaurant section , the very limited manual , and that the display can be a bit tough to read when in direct sunlight overall , a great buy for the money .
honestly i thought i could be happy when i bought a tomtom 510 after having used the c330 for a few months , solely to get the handsfree bluetooth .
but the tomtom sucked so bad on visibility in any amount of sunlight that i returned it , and bought a handsfree visor clip motorola bluetooth for less than the difference in price i believe between the 2 gpses .
excellent choice .
i am a bargain hunter , but when it comes to the c330 , savings is not the goal , its about accurancy , and it is exactly what the gps provides you .
worth every penny i paid for it .
i like this product very much .
i also own a hiking garmin receiver -LRB- e trex vista -RRB- , and i 'm quite happy with the quality and durability of the garmin products very quick to re calculate routes , and extremely good reception .
in fact , this unit still receives perfectly while indoors .
never seen that before if you see it on sale , grab it .
for the price , it 's a steal .
i paid $ 329 cad for a new one -LRB- not refurb -RRB- in edmonton , alberta , canada .
i first purchased a slick , newer , introductory gps brand .
it may have looked better with more features , but in the end i took it back due to a confusing interface and terrible accuracy i exchanged it for this model and never looked back .
it may appear a little outdated next to its newer cousins but here 's a case where something is made right the first time and could stand up just fine against the competition took a couple of minutes to setup using usb and net to download latest patches and maps but once i got it on the road it is simplicity itself with two options to get you going , where to and view map .
other than a cursory glance at the manual -LRB- really just a sheet with 5 or so steps to get you going -RRB- , i is on my way since then , i 've been all over town and have not missed a beat .
not only is it accurate , but gives you sufficient time and warnings as to where you should be after you make turns do not look for a ton of bells and whistles i 'm sure you can get that in a pricier model but for what it does , it 's right on .
no worries for those tired of fighting with maps and getting lost i 'd definitely recommend it .
overall the c330 is an amazing navigation device that provides outstanding performance and is a great value and i would recommend to anyone first comment is about automotive gps 's in general .
i found that night driving in unfamiliar areas is significantly less fatiguing -LRB- and safer -RRB- since you are not having to multitask with reading maps and struggling to see signs on dark and unfamiliar roads .
you always know you are on the correct route which also reduces stress level and fatigue .
knowing where gas stations , hotels and food is along your route makes having a good poi database invaluable .
a gps also reduces clutter from maps and trip books i recently purchased a c330 prior to a trip from ny to sc , about an 870 mile trip one way .
although it took less than 5 mins to learn to use its basic mapping and route functions , i spent about an hour playing with it and viewing every possible screen and feature .
it is very easy and intuitive to use and my wife , whom is not a techie , learned to use it quickly and really likes the c330 .
on our trip the c330 performed flawlessly .
if we had to detour due to road construction , its ultra fast processor recalculated and provided an updated route in as little as 2 seconds or so and it provides instant voice prompts we found the poi database to be comprehensive and is simple to use and we used it heavily to find hotels , food , grocery stores and gas stations along our route as well as when we arrived in sc .
maybe all gps 's have this , but the c330 allows you to select poi 's at your trip origin , near your current location , along your current route or at your destination .
it defaults to nearest your current location .
once you 've selected a poi you can hit a button to view its location on a map .
at night we would decide about 30 mins before we wanted to stop and used the poi database to find hotels about 20 40 miles ahead along our route .
the database provides phone numbers so we could call ahead for prices and room availability the trip computer is great and very accurately calculated arrival time and provided other stats about the trip and updated quickly if you hit delays or moved along more quickly the screen can be setup to automatically dim and switch to night mode based on local sunset times and returns to day mode at sunrise .
the screen is easy to see and clear , even when the sun is shining inside the van a few nice to have improvements on the c330 , but by no means needed would be a where am i right now button , the ability to see lat/lon and elevation , the ability to pan around the navigation map without have to go through a couple of menu screens , although it is fairly easy as is i also considered the tomtom one , but decided on the garmin c330 due to its significantly more extensive poi data and better windshield mount .
although i like the regular shape and size of the tomtom better i also considered buying a model up from the c330 , the c340 , but i did n't care for the digital warble in the text to speech voice instructions .
the voice on the c330 is much clearer , but does n't say the street name i also looked at a few units $ 100 ' + more but did n't see those additional features as something i needed .
traffic updates and weather would be nice , but i do not travel on long trips enough to justify subscribing to such services .
i have been nothing but thrilled with the simplicity and perfection of this unit .
all bells and whistles aside , this thing does the job .
it gets you from where you are to where you need to be in a clear , reliable and informed manner .
pluses include quick re routing , saving often traveled destinations , and the ability to search for lodging , atms , restaurants etc .
in your area .
this is the best and least expensive upgrade i ve ever given my car .
this beats tom tom one and mio digiwalker both for its ' ease and accuracy .
within seconds i can be off on a trip , but i fumbled with the tom tom .
it 's more accurate than the mio , and can find almost any street .
it does not have as many features , but for just over 200 dollars , it 's probably the best gps for the money .
before this i used my lg vx 8300 phone , and that to me is great .
so other than that basis , this is my first real street gps unit , and it is the easiest most reliable piece of electronics i own , i love it , i find myself going out more often trying to get lost .
i am terrible with directions , so this is great for me .
i took out of the box , turned it on , and is on my way , it is that easy .
ready right out of the box .
directions were spot on , i love it .
i bought my c330 from futureshop .
ca -LRB- sister store to best buy in canada -RRB- .
it is a refurbished model and i paid $ 279 cdn .
i have used it a number of times and find it simple to use .
unlike the official summary i find the screen adjusts nicely to different types of daylight .
i have not used it at night yet .
when i tell it to get me somewhere it has a specific route in mind and when i go a different way as i know it is a bit shorter or there is construction the c330 keeps trying to turn me around so i go it 's route .
it eventually figures it out though , just be patient .
on turning it on i find it takes about 45 seconds to find a satellite .
the volume control for the voice is great and i have changed mine to a british accent .
the one thing it does not do which the newer and much more expensive ones do is tell you the street name you need to turn on , but really for me that seemed minor .
the screen shows you the name of the street and there is plenty of warning of upcoming turns .
i used this right out of the box without reading any instructions .
the unit is a bit bulky to carry around -LRB- walking -RRB- and it would be great if it came with a storage bag or container for when you are not using it .
it is very simple in that it allows only one route at a time to be plugged in , but does allow you to quick key home and some favorites .
i can not wait to take a road trip and really try it out .
i highly recommend it if you usually rely on mapquest or similar for directions .
i am directionally challenged even in my own city and really appreciate it .
this is my first gps unit , and i love it .
i did a lot of research and the garmin 330 is great .
all controls use the touch screen which makes it very easy to use and navigate .
i is able to figure everything out without any directions the best thing is that this unit works right out of the box .
just plug it in and go .
zero downloading and uploading of maps , no need for a computer -LRB- though it does have a usb port -RRB- the screen is not as large as some other gps 's , but is plenty big and bright to use at anytime during the day or night i highly recommend this product .
owning my own limo business this is the best product that i bought .
my friend has the tomtom and we went away with it , we got lost and put us on streets that where no longer there .
in my business i cant afford to take the wrong turn not easy to turn around .
the garmin c330 is nice and small and easy to bring in any car .
never again will i travel with out it .
this is a plus to have for lots of driving .
an excellent entry level automobile gps device .
my wife used it on the second day we had it , in a location 1000 miles from home and it worked wonderfully .
easy transport from car to car .
garmin c330 in reading reviews i had decided to go with a garmin gps for two reasons .
one is the .
good review ratings and next because of the useable size , no buttons on the side meant it would block the drivers view less than some other gps systems .
and the c330 s screen is more than ample in size .
my first impulse is to buy the garmin i3 because of cost factor .
but the c330 is pre loaded had a larger screen 2 x 3 as vs .
the i3 s 1 .
3 x1 .
7 which makes the streets you are approaching easier to read my first test is a trip around my neighborhood i input a destination with a via a restaurant and it did well , .
telling me the restaurant is on the left in 500 feet .
but no mention is made when i drove past this .
restaurant .
i expected something like hay you missed it it promptly directed me to my destination a .
wal mart store up the road i turned around in the driveway and entered grocery store for the trip back to home base , it gave me several locations the closest of which is 15 miles when there are two grocery stores just up the road not to mention the wal mart where i is sitting in the parking lot .
but when i put in the name of the grocery store it did give me a direct route .
next i entered my home address and it gave me a direct route back , but i purposely drifted off course made a left turn instead of a right and it gave me new directions to my home base but without the u turn i had expected as this would have been the shorter route while at a stop light i wondered what would happen if i turned the unit around , would it think i is going the other way .
nope it stayed pointing towards home base .
i had not tried this while on the move though .
i did notice that either my speedometer is off by 2 mph or the garmin is on the interstate later this is changed to a 4 mph difference the c330 is a blessing in the heavy houston traffic , i hit the detour button and it quickly routed me through side streets like i had lived there all my life .
i guess it saved me at least an hour in stop and go traffic and made my appointment on time .
then with a touch of the home button it directed me back out of the city and headed for home another thing that should be noted is that in new construction where new roads lead in a different direction than the old ones , the c330 thinks you have veered off course but this is to be expected of all gps systems some improvements i would like to suggest is higher volume , a hood over the screen to shade the sunlight , .
and highway rest stops programmed in all in all buy it its something you thought you would never need , but will never be without .
i read this site for all reviews on gps and finally bought this and i would say i 'm extremely satisfy .
it meets the 3 basic needs of a gps ie accurate maps , good routing and fast response the good accurate and fast sat pickup .
it even pickup the rail route when i is travelling in a train .
batteries last 4 hours as advt , more than my laptop .
it will show the overall route if less than 2500k .
eg montreal to palm beach .
you can program one intermediate stop -LRB- this is bad -RRB- .
lots of poi -LRB- 5 mil -RRB- with phone numbers which is great .
can even do a wild card name search for restaurant etc .
no problem with screen washout even with sun glass .
ok if the sun is over the horizon , you cant see much over the hood anyways the bad it doesnt show all poi on map as you travel unlike some user said .
you have to pick from a list and show one at a time .
maybe garmin didnt want the whole map fill with poi icons .
odd shape is not made for portability even though thats what i do next step is to try it on my bike it would be nice to have text to speech feature but why pay hundred more there are cheaper gps around but garmin is at the forefront in avaiation gps and the quality of the unit did not disappoint higher end gps adds mp3 , bluetooth , traffic report etc for 3 to 4 hundred more , i said why bother if all you need is to find shrtest route not get lost .
it packs a punch .
it 's ready to use right out of the box .
very easy to underestimate this puppy until you turn it on .
for the price paid , 489 $ cad , i am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product .
map for north america is very detailled with a lot of points of interest -LRB- poi 's -RRB- .
written and spoken language are very good french canadian is the only one i used up to now .
bracket system with a ` suck ' is not working properly and fall dowm after a while .
if you are looking for a great out of the box gps then look no further than the c330 .
i got mine at comp usa for $ 299 -LRB- $ 399 $ 100 mail in rebate -RRB- .
my dad has the 2720 and i fell in love with his , but i did not want to spend what he did the color screen is great and looks good .
the speech directions are clear and easily audible .
it has a great battery that i have yet to run out .
has lots of poi 's and is very helpful .
an added feature that i found useful is that it also gives the phone number of the poi you look up -LRB- golf courses to make tee time , hotels , etc .
the only thing i have found difficult is that my big fingers sometimes have trouble hitting the wrong key when entering address information , but that is nothing that a little patience and practice can improve great unit , and would highly recommend .
i bought my c330 at abe 's of maine with a 3 year warranty .
so far , the c330 has worked great and i have taken it all over the country and it has performed as advertised the screen does wash out a bit in the direct sunlight but that has been a minor inconvenience .
it is very easy to use with a great user interface having an alternate route would have helped me in the traffic congestion of la or chicago .
also , on a recent trip to sedona , az it suggested i follow the more direct route which is a deserted 2 lane highway versus staying on the interstate .
the interstate is faster in the long run all in all i am still learning some of its features but great product none the less .
the c330 is a great gps product .
poi are great when your are out of your area for food , fuel etc .
great support from garmin for updates .
i recently use it for 1800 mile trip with out paper maps .
very accurate with arrival time directions .
love this product .
it is really good i have never used a stat nav before but this is really user friendly .
i 've had my c330 for about a month and i , like many people did the research online and read the reviews .
the people that hate it need to give it a chance or get a replacement .
i have found roads -LRB- and ways out of them -RRB- that i never knew existed .
that said , i have never gotten lost -LRB- sometimes when we get bored , we go way out in the country and try to get lost , but we never do -RRB- .
sure , occasionally pois are empty lots or just not there , but after further research , i found out that poi data is gathered from multiple sources impossible to verify and can be as old as 5 years not garmin 's fault .
so far it has never let me down .
we call our c330 sally and sally unlike in car units never says driving on undigitized road or proceed with caution because the map coverage is limited she knows all and gets us there safe every time .
yes , sally does have an occasional burp , like the time she told us to go on road 82 west when we absolutely knew we needed to go on 82 east , but this is very uncommon .
she has all the great road data you need , like gas stations , food , hotels , parks -LRB- a big one with kids -RRB- and more .
i have never lost satellite reception except in the house and i 'm not driving in there .
i would really rate sally at 8 .
5 just because of the minor and insignificant hiccops along the way .
this unit is amazing , have used it on several trips in the first two weeks of ownership .
during one massive 12 mile long traffic jam in georgia , i simply pressed detour and it took me to my destination , around the traffic and saved me at least 1 2 hours .
this happened 3 more times during my 1200 mile car trip , amazing .
i think reviews less than 9 are mostly because users did not understand all the features , and how to use them .
for example , this unit , even though it has over 5 million points of interest , and every street in america , still has a sd memory card slot .
plug in a 1 mg card and you have far more power than you 'll ever use also , it has the ability to hold up to 50 separate , customized destinations enter all your business contacts , friends out of state , whatever .
it recalibrates when you take a wrong turn , and its fast .
i bought my steetpilot c330 , got in my car , and in less than 5 minutes -LRB- most of that a 1 time automated satellite setup -RRB- , i is navigating all over the planet .
the screen is great , the maps seem to be very accurate and detailed , and the ui is so simple to use that you really do not need a user manual while it allows you to search poi 's in a multitude of ways , it would be nice if you could just simply enter the destination phone number .
however , that is such a small inconvenience , that it is hardly worth mentioning all in all , a great device that just plain works .
this is the 2nd gps for me after the magellan roadmate 360 which i owned for exacly 3 days .
i returned the magellan and bought this for $ 20 .
00 more .
the price is close but they are worlds apart otherwise this thing is great .
it calculates routes quickly and the voice navigation issues clear instructions .
there is no trip planning feature -LRB- which is why i bought the magellan -RRB- , but it is so easy to enter a destination , that it does n't matter to me the menus are very simple and well done .
you wo n't even need the manual .
which is good since you have to download it anyway my only gripe i do n't understand why garmin went through the trouble of having an internal battery , and then made the power cable not detachable .
there are 2 very small screws holding the cable into the otherwise excellent bracket .
i unscewed them and removed the cable , but if the battery dies , i 'll have to put it back together for charging .
i do n't think they intended for it to disconnect .
but from the drivers seat i can not see the bracket behind the unit , so without the cable it looks like it 's just floating .
very cool for the $ 500 $ 600 price range , this is a great unit .
much better in every way than the magellan 360 my last bit of advice these gps devices all have their little quirks .
i highly recommend purchasing from retailers with generous return policies , in case you do not like the one you picked .
this device is fantastic , and is a must have for any business traveler .
it makes you an instant local by navigating around an area like a pro .
i highly recommend .
this is my first gps i 'm hooked .
great value .
i brought a printout from a discount website to best buy they did a price match for $ 499 .
i highly recommend .
i got the c330 has a gift .
as a business professional , i 'm often on the road and have to travel distances .
i is never really bad at directions , but to remember to take such and such road and then take such and such exit is not always easy .
or sometimes you 'd take the wrong turn and wind up somewhere you have n't got a clue .
well , the c330 has come along and really helped me out this compact device is , so far , near 100 % accurate in getting me to where i had to go .
it always finds the satellite .
it always recalculates if you veer off course for whatever reason .
the voice prompts are nice and loud and clear .
i guess it would be nice if it would state the street name you are about to turn on rather than just saying turn left but for about $ 700 its more than adequate the points of interest is really neat .
type in the name of a store , restaurant , etc .
and it will most likely find it this device is simple to use and operate .
literally , type the address where you have to go and that its .
it starts calculating the route automatically if any updates come out you can just connect your device to your pc -LRB- windows only , unfortunately -RRB- , and it will provide any updates for the device .
i really can not say enough good positive things about the c330 .
it you travel often and do n't want to be concerned about remember directions or have to get to somewhere in a pinch where directions are not readily available , the c330 will be a blessing .
a top notch device .
i 've only had this gps a few days and am very happy with it .
i love that you can take an alternate route , and the gps recalculates it for you , on the fly .
it is also very easy to use .
plug it in , and you 're ready to go , -LRB- since all the maps are pre loaded -RRB- .
there are so many points of interest too , i tried to find an indian resturant , and found 2 i did not know about .
way cool .
this is my first gps , but i really do n't know what other features you need .
i do not care if i have a mp3 player , or some of the other ` high end ' features i read about .
this looks to be perfect for us , and i recommend it .
i will update this review in a couple months , if i find problems .
i thought this is the best buy for the money , and found it at my local electronics store for less than $ 560 .
i have read only a few negatives on this unit , but i have not experienced any of them yet .
glare on the screen .
none so far .
or satelite drops .
none so far .
my friend has a garmin that is more ` high end ' and cost twice as much , and honestly , i did not see what he is paying for .
the c330 works great , and is simply a great buy .
enjoy .
i bought this item this weekend in rainy ny .
not a bit of sun in the sky and it worked flawlessly .
also had it in the suburbs with densely packed foliage overhead and it worked fine .
so far , every poi i looked up is right where it is supposed to be and got me there without an issue .
i took multiple wrong turns on purpose and the unit recalculates a new course in seconds this is not a super high end unit , but its not supposed to be .
it is a mid level unit that functions extremely well .
it should have a high end price , but it does not .
i paid under $ 600 the top portable units range between $ 800 and 1200 very happy with this purchase .
this is a great device .
i have had several navs built into my various cars in the past and this model outshines them hands down .
the touch screen is very easy to use and the memory is large enough to have stored every location i 've searched for so far .
the screen is easy to see and the voice prompts are very pleasant .
i think the price point is very competitive .
note that the 330 comes with the whole country already in the device -LRB- the 320 requires larger memory cards to accomplish that and requires that you download them from your computer -RRB- .
i 'd recommend a case to store it .
i only wish it showed the distance to destination in addition to simply the time to destination .
i also notice the distance to an upcoming turn could be a little more accurate when you are traveling at speed -LRB- its fine if you are moving slowly -RRB- .
this is a great looking device and extremely easy to use .
this is a great unit .
i is 2000 miles away from home in a remote location and i needed an auto parts store .
i typed in parts and found the nearest auto parts store and the unit even gave me the phone number to call for hours of operation .
without this unit , i would have searched for hours for a store .
i read many reviews on several units for days and days .
i is considering the rm300 , rm700 , tomtom go 700 , iway500 and a couple of others i also had a chance to use a 2620 for a week to test it out plus some experience with some earlier gps units i have owned in the past i rolled that all together and came out very nervously purchasing the c330 .
i went that it seemed most people who have owned it thought it is great , and the only complaint is that it is a bit simple well now that i have bought it , i can tell you its simple as a feature not so much a limitation .
it is very easy to use and well thought out , its not only for the computer challenged , its also for anyone who can appreciate a good gadget when they see it .
you do n't have to be complicated to be superior .
ipod anyone there is also some concern with the washout in bright sunlight .
so i checked that out first , actually i carried it outside in the direct sun to see if it would fade away .
it does fade a bit , but still very visible .
so do n't be scared away by that so if you like a device that is streamlined for ease of use , your going to love it , whether your a gadget nut or not , it works so well it 's amazing .
it saves time , aggravation , and well its fun to use on the other hand , if you have need for all that other oddball things some of the other gps offers that does not have to do with driving , -LRB- like a hiker or you own a boat or plane -RRB- then maybe it might not be for you .
i had my choices narrowed down to the magellan rm700 and the garmin 330c .
at first i went with the rm700 , but returned it two days later beacuse it is too big , and the mount shook alot , and the map is not completely accurate i waited about a week and bought the c330 -LRB- good thing i did becasue the price dropped about $ 250 in that time -RRB- .
the c330 is wonderful , it is easy to use and has almost the same functions as the rm770 .
the only functions i notied it does not have is showing current elevation and street number on each said a t current locations .
the c330 makes up for those two features with having may more poi 's -LRB- 5 million compared to 2 million -RRB- , more stable mount , smaller and ligher , battery backup -LRB- est .
4 hr -RRB- , and a built in clock and est time of arrival if you are deciding between the rm700 or the c330 , go with the c330 .
you will not be disappointed .
i 've compared and contrasted all the gps systems out there , though some of you may not agree , i found the garmin c330 to be the most reliable and simple .
look , while i 'm driving i just need to get to point a to point b .
but it also has thousands of local listings -LRB- even phone numbers -RRB- , it 's like having a gps system with the yellow pages .
and the voice , crystal clear .
i highly reccommend it to everyone , if you love to drive and have an affinity for ` hittin ' the road , the c330 is an excellent guide to have along .
i have just reviewed the roadmate 700 -LRB- took it back to sams club -RRB- the garmin 60c -LRB- took it back to bestbuy -RRB- the garmin 76 cs -LRB- took it back to boatersworld cause it is a used unit and couldnt hold the sat signal finally got the right one .
the garmin c330 .
everything i is looking for a more in a sweet little portable unit .
i even take it into the house and put in some addresses and future spots to visit .
it works for hours indoors with no wires .
-LRB- 4 hour batterylife -RRB- .
just all around the best of the best .
the two nearest to this unit are the new roadmate 760 and the tom tom go 700 i think i 'll stick with the garmin .
all around feels right .
i love this gps .
i did a lot of research on gps units before i bought .
i is looking at the sp 2620 , but it is almost 2 years old .
i want something that just came out .
this is released about 3 months ago .
great accuracy , a little trouble getting a signal when cold , about 2 min .
but all in all a good firt time gps unit .
i love new toys and have about worn this one out .
it does everything i can think of .
if i do not know the address , type in the business search for the type of business and there it will be .
everything is preloaded .
the sound is built in there is one thing i do not like .
when you turn it on and start to drive it does not switch to the map .
you have to push the button to view map .
just one little thing this is an awsome product and if you need it to get you around town and on the occasional long distance trip it is great .
i travel about 3000 miles a month as a sales person and it has done everything to get me where i needed to go .
i really love this little gadget .
it makes city driving a much more pleasant experience .
i do not have to worry about watching for the correct exit .
just relax and trust the little garmin to get you there .
you know what time you will arrive .
want to take another route , no problem the garmin just lets you know you are off route and recalculates a new route .
they did an excellent job of designing the garmin c330 , i can not find a thing i would change .
i is surprised at how many locations are available for selection as destinations .
restaurants , shopping , history , libraries , intersections , cities , hospitals , police stations , you name it it 's there .
i live in a rural area and is pleasantly suprised that even rural gravel roads are there .
little towns that are practically ghost towns also , it is simply amazing to me .
the only trouble , i will miss it very much if i ever have to drive without it now .
i go camping quite a bit and is looking for a gps that would get me from point a to point b without having to learn how to use the darn thing .
the streetpilot c330 is perfect .
i bought it -LRB- probably paid too much , but that 's another story -RRB- , walked out to my car , plugged it in and typed in my home address and whiz bang , it is up and working i think technology should make my life easier not more complicated .
this gps is easy to use and it works well .
also , it recalculates new routes very fast as soon as it says , ` off route recalculating ' it has the new route displayed ok , so i can not use it in an airplane .
i do not fly .
it 's not waterproof so using it in a boat is not a good idea i already have a boat gps system ask youself what you want from a gps .
if useablity and simplicity are important , then this baby is for you .
i 've done a lot of research on gps units for my cars and found the c330 to be the best of the lot for the price .
all the stores around me were selling it for the same price , so i ended up buying it online for about $ 230 cheaper -LRB- including free shipping and no sales tax -RRB- screen size there are several gps models out there with bigger screens than the c330 , but they 're also bulkier or had several functions shown on screen that took away from the map view , so their map view size is actually comparable to the c330 .
if viewing size is important , you can get gps units that are integrated with a cd/dvd in dash unit with much bigger screens , but also much bigger prices -LRB- around 3 times more than the c330 from what i 've seen -RRB- .
but for units that will sit on your dash or attach to your windshield , compactness is a plus functions i 've rented cars that have gps units in them and i 've found them extremely useful and have saved me many a driving headache in my travels to unfamiliar places .
the features in the c330 are similar to what i 've used in the past for the most part .
i really wanted one that gave audible directions as i 've found this extremely useful in heavy traffic where you do n't want to take your eyes off the road .
the 3 d view is new and stretches out the screen so you can see a little bit more of what s coming up than in the 2 d mode .
the only thing i have n't found is a unit that provides real time updates on traffic situations .
i used one in the uk that notified you if you were approaching congestion/accidents and gave suggestions for alternate routes .
guess the u .
is not up to speed on this yet .
the unit does re calculate your route if you turn early or miss your turn and the re calculation is nearly instantaneous limitations i 've seen a lot of complaints across the board on how the maps do not keep up with changes and will take you to restaurants and stores that no longer exist .
this appears to be a universal problem so no one map system appears to be far ahead of others -LRB- i even had a few wrong turns in the uk due to this -RRB- .
it 's just something you have to accept with current gps systems updates map updates are offered through most manufacturers with some free and some at a price .
garmin charges anywheres from $ 6 $ 150 for updates depending on your needs , so this is definitely something you want to look in to .
software updates for the unit appear to be free and they ll notify you via e mail whenever there s an update if you ask them to overall , the c330 struck me as very user friendly and easy to enter in travel destinations and addresses .
plus the size and portability rated pretty high on my list .
great unit .
i have used my new c330 for a couple of days and i think i have identified the good and the bad the good the screen , while it looked small in the store , is actually more than adequate in the car .
it is bright , clear , and crisp .
the touch screen works very well , and it is easy to enter text when saving locations or searching by city or name .
the audio is also plenty loud on the highest setting .
the point of interest -LRB- poi -RRB- library is very good .
one of the things i hated about using the yellow pages if you wanted to find a store , is that you have no idea what is close to you and what is not .
with the c330 , you select the category , such as auto parts , and it lists all the stores that are close to you in order from closest to farthest .
or , if you know the name of the store , you can search for that and it will show you all the stores in the chain , along with the distance to each .
it also gives you the phone number .
you can browse the map -LRB- where you can zoom and scroll -RRB- or just hit go to start navigating to it .
if you are hungry for chinese food , you select food , chinese , and then it will find all the restaurants in your area .
it remembers all your recent searches , so you can find them again quickly , or you can save them with any name you chose in your favorites section .
when you are navigating , if you get off route , it will recalculate very quickly .
the 3d map view is cool , but the standard view is easier to follow when you have streets very close together at strange angles .
tracking and map seem to be extremely accurate .
it zooms out automatically when you are far from the next turn , and zooms in as you get close .
you can also zoom in and out using the touch screen .
you can get all the info about your trip -LRB- how long you have been driving , speeds , etc . -RRB-
, and see detailed turn by turn written instructions if you want to know what it has planned for you .
the mounting system is also excellent the suction cup is strong , and the unit clips in and out of the arm very easily .
no power cord to hook up as it is part of the mount .
comes with separate charger for indoors as well as usb cable for future upgrades .
it s a garmin the company is not going anywhere and maps should continue to get better the bad you can t save multiple routes .
however , that is not a big deal because it will keep all your recent searches very handy , and with very fast calculations , you can just select the next stop after you reach the first one .
a couple times it told me to turn when the map view clearly told me to go straight .
don t know if it is responding to a subtle bend in the road .
therefore , you need to navigate with the visual as well as the audio to not make a mistake .
you can t tell it that a street has a no left turn sign if that fact is not in the map database .
you have to drive past the turn and let it re calculate another way to get to the destination -LRB- i doubt other companies offer this editing feature either -RRB- i really like this unit .
my brother is also in the market for a portable gps and is buying the same one after trying mine .
highly recommended .
comes with a very stable window mounting device .
interface quite intuitive , easy learning curve out of the box .
claims a 5 million poi database , as opposed to the magellan roadmate 700 which claims 2 million .
is able to find many local places but with a bit of searching required .
when listing the possible choices it only puts them in order of distance from the origin , not in alphabetical order , forcing you to scroll through a sometimes long screen .
the integral battery makes it easy to use indoors to program your destinations , and save them in a ` favorites list ' .
the internal hard drive is a blessing that avoids have to use separate memory cards or download maps from your computer .
the manual is useful but very basic .
could use a more complete explanation of the possible ways to use it , and the variations that determine what route is given to you .
using it in an area that i is already familiar with revealed the database did not differentiate between large main thoroughfares and side streets through residential areas , but perhaps i 'm expecting too much .
overall very happy with the device .
i have owned this gps for about 1 week now and i love everything that it does and how easy it is to navigate around to the different screens .
the poi list is just magnificent but the maps are outdated on this model .
when i registered my gps , right out of the box , i is advised that there is a map update avaiable for a cost of $ 69 .
i did not like that after purchasing a new product that the software for the maps are not the most current once windows came out with windows vista , how many computers still come with windows xp .
i would expect the same from garmin .
a great buy .
have used the c330 in several parts of the country .
noted a causeway that is several years old not showing .
contacted garmin .
told that it is on the v2008 map , but not avail on c330 , c350 quest2 .
these units do not have the capacity to hold it .
can buy the v2008 map , but must select non alaska non canada portions or download those , but then no lower48 states usa .
told you can download the portions you need as often as needed from the map dvd would be helpful if garmin disclosed these issues prior to purchase .
picked it up at best buy on sale for $ 220 .
00 i am a garmin fan for many years with hand held hiking gps 's .
i quickly realized how great this unit is .
i named the unit sally because of the whiny female voice .
the only error it makes so far with mapping is the road i live on .
every time i come home she tries to put me on the lower road .
i fixed this with putting the physical location of my house and now it says it is recalculating but gets me home .
i have made many road trips , urban and rural and the unit has worked great .
several friends spent big bucks on gps 's with more features but admit to not using any except the basic ones in the 330 .
all in all any realist would happily use and appreciate the garmin 330 .
jackie helped me set up my garmin street pilot c330 .
it is such a wonderful piece of technology .
i is filled with trepidation upon receipt of this wonderful gadget , but when jackie explained it to me and i became aware of how user friendly it actually is , i realized all my fears were for naught .
it is so much fun to see it show me along the way where to go .
i have a certain feeling of confidence with the thing .
simple and intuitive to set up and use .
so far no problems and seems to be exactly what i need .
overall , garmin makes the best navigation units .
that said , the c330 is of course a fantastic product for the price .
as a first time buyer , this unit has exceeded my expectations .
i thought it would get lost in an urban jungle , it performed perfectly -LRB- with external antenna attached -RRB- .
one of the highlights i have to say is setting the voice to a british english accent .
on a more practical observation ; i travel around the country a lot , so the ability to easily transfer the unit from place to place , vehicle to vehicle and then have it ready to go with maps and poi 's just blew me away , even when i is in hawaii .
having an personal navigation unit is like having a microwave , you can not believe you went so long without having one now that i 'm completely spoiled , some veteran wants for future purchases -LRB- or for you first time buyers with more money to dedicate to a gps unit -RRB- .
it can not be used for talking on your cell phone .
no weather forecasts .
no traffic updates .
why those things are practical many times when using my bluetooth headset , the voice recognition on my phone does not recognize what i 'm saying , so after a minute of trying i usually just flip open the phone in my hand and manually type in the number .
obviously this is a bigger road hazard than if you had nice big touch screen buttons/options for calling on your dash/windshield mounted gps display which is facing the road not knowing what the weather can be like is a pain if you 're commuting , meeting someone for dinner , etc .
on a recent trip to washington , d .
i checked the weather forecast before i left and it said overcast with spotty snow showers .
of course 3 hours into the trip , the weather changed .
the storm front shifted south and now i 70 is getting pounded with hail and sleet .
the roads became treacherous and cars were sliding into ditches literally left and right on top of all the fender benders that happened .
i is an hour late to my meeting as a result .
having a real time weather center in your car is especially handy , no necessary this leads me into my last want .
real time traffic .
rush hour is typically predictable , accidents and road work are not always .
thus , knowing if there 's 3 lanes blocked due to an accident on 101 n to san fran is better to know while you 're still in san jose and you have options like 280 instead of finding out in palo alto -LRB- true story -RRB- .
for the price -LRB- $ 265 .
00 at samsclub .
com -RRB- i don t think you can beat it .
this is my first car navigation device and i like it .
the c330 provides accurate navigation and is easy to use with pre loaded maps .
i also like the garmin webupdater that provides an easy way to update the software .
my only criticism is that the points of interest -LRB- poi -RRB- that are included in the latest map are not inclusive and out of date .
for example , there are several restaurants in my neighborhood that have been around for years but are not listed on the map .
i think this gps is a great buy , i have had it in my vehicle for a couple weeks now and it works flawlessly .
the screen glares in direct sunlight , but i bought some glare resistant screen protectors -LRB- need to keep from scratching the screen anyway -RRB- and the problem is no longer an issue .
i purchased this is 11/06 for $ 350 and have been well pleased with that purchase .
the voice navigation is excellent and easy to hear .
the screen is large enough , to be seen easily , and contrary to cnet 's review i find that the screen does not wash out .
only one time has it been wrong on a route i picked .
is does lack a good dash mount , which can be purchased separately .
over all this is a great gps for the price .
clear concise voice navigation , easy to see screen , and built in maps .
all for under $ 400 .
you can not go wrong with this unit .
i 'm a big fan of garmin gps units have one for a plane , one -LRB- this one -RRB- for a car , one for my bike and two for hiking .
they all feature a user interface that passes my simplest test if you have to use the manual , it was not designed well .
this gps worked like a charm right from the start .
pop in an address and it -LRB- usually -RRB- acquires satellites quickly , maps out a route , offers an estimated time of arrival and -LRB- on a separate page -RRB- shows countdown mileage , max speed , etc .
works flawlessly , and i 've driven it all over the country -LRB- great for the rental car when you arrive in some unfamiliar city -RRB- .
the voice is very nice , and if you 're bored you can program it to speak any one of a dozen or more languages .
i find it gives my turns to me well ahead of time without being annoying , and lets me know exactly where to go in confusing situations .
some complaints , all of which i can live with 1 -RRB- i wish it had the option to show a wider and more detailed map area ; sometimes that allows you pick out a route the gps itself has n't mapped for you .
2 -RRB- like any gps , it 'll occasionally and obstinately pick a dumb route .
if you ignore it and go a different way , though , it 's very quick to recalculate .
3 -RRB- i have n't figured out how to get it to find an airport or car rental place whose street address i do not know .
these quibbles notwithstanding , a great basic gps .
the garmin 330 is a gift to my wife who has absolutely no concept of mapreading .
she is running the garmin 5 minutes out of the box , and set it to find a private home 90 miles away that we needed to locate .
it got us within 15 feet of the destination first shot .
there are units with more features , but how many routes will you be driving at one time anyway .
it thinks our home is around 200 ft from the actual location -LRB- the largest inaccuracy found -RRB- for some reason .
definitely buy the protective case , as an unprotected accidental drop will be very expensive .
the eta provided by the unit is remarkably close to reality almost scary .
this is my first gps unit and i think it is great .
it does not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive products , but it does the job for me .
does not say the street names , but it shows them clearly , so thats fine with me .
maps are not always the shortest route -LRB- they generally do find the shortest way -RRB- , but they always get you where you are going .
this is my first gps -LRB- i got it because i just moved -RRB- and i love it .
my uncle actually had this very unit and i got one after i played with his for a while .
it 's really easy to use , intuitive , and clear .
if you play with it for about 10 min before you ever try to use it in the car , you will probably figure out 85 95 % of the things that it does .
it 's so easy to use that there 's no user 's manual in the box .
there 's a quick guide that comes with it -LRB- which tells you almost everything about it anyway -RRB- and a downloadable manual -LRB- which is helpful in figuring out two specific functions i is having trouble with -RRB- .
this unit is nothing fancy or sophisticated , but the touch screen is easy to use and accurate .
excellent unit for someone that just doesnt want to read directions as they drive along , not too many other bells and whistles it also has a gas stations nearby function which has saved me a few times the only complaint i have is the urban jungle effect i live in dc and the buildings can sometimes block out the satellite reception .
very annoying , but i can live with it i also recommend getting it at walmart that is the least expensive place i found it from a big retailer -LRB- so it 's easy to return if you dont like it -RRB- .
price i paid bought at best buy on june 24 , 2006 .
best buy matched circuit city 's price of $ 449 .
best buy had for $ 499 .
i had a 12 % off coupon from best buy .
customer service manager took off the 12 % from the $ 449 price match .
i paid $ 395 before taxes .
if it was not for the price match and 12 % off coupon , this unit is slighly expensive and i would look at the garmin streetpilot i5 how it works in my car i opened the box , instructions are very simple .
plug in cord to power outlet , connect to unit , mount unit and stick to windshield .
power on .
took less than a minute to find satellite typed in home address and saved it as favorites .
pulled out of parking lot and garmin unit told me which way to turn with voice prompts and 3d map .
map and voice prompt were accurate heading home , there are three different ways to get to my house .
unit , by default , is programmed to the fastest way home .
meaning , mileage may be longer , but the unit is programmed to go that way .
you can change the setting to use mileage instead of time .
i went a different way home than the unit told me .
after missing a turn , the unit tries to get me back on the original track , which is cool .
after several missed turns that would have got me back on the original route , unit then realized the way i is going home -LRB- by figuring that i had missed so many turns to get back , that my way is now the fastest -RRB- , and started using those directions this is my first unit .
travel frequently to locations i have not been before .
google maps yahoo maps , etc & can not compete with this .
don t know why it took so long to buy this .
screen is easy to see .
voice can be turned up and down another cool feature want to know what restaurants are around .
i stopped to buy gas on trip home .
clicked on restaurants and it started listing them and the miles away from where i stopped chris menard .

i got this unit to replace a finedrive 400 , so it 's best to compare the two so you will understand what i mean what i miss from the finedrive the ability to touch the current location and set it as a favorite destination in one step ; flexibility in how to enter new locations ; the on screen icons for hospitals , golf courses , parks , etc ; the floating compass for direction or true north ; the sweet scottish sounding woman 's voice what i like more/better about my new c330 startup times are fast ; i can actually see the screen while wearing polarized sunglasses ; portable battery power so i can set it for a trip while sitting in my home ; simplicity of operation and clear directional arrows -LRB- large -RRB- ; auto magnifying of map as you get closer to a city so you can see streets ; the car mounting system if far superior in function and strength so , which is better .
can not tell you , but i do really like the new c330 .
you wo not go wrong by picking one up .
have been using it for a week now .
works amazing .
bought this brand new on ebay , it turned out to be refurbished .
it looks new and functions like new .
it took 10 mins out of the box to find satelite and once it locked in , i is able to find just about any addresses i knew .
i would guess that it has a very current map of the us .
i is able to find our hotel in daytona beach , fl and my brother 's address in mn with no problems .
for the two weeks i used , only once it lost signal for 2 seconds and locked on again .
i am overall very impressed with this gps .
i paid $ 400 including shipping .
i will be going to boston in 2 weeks so i will post an update because all the reviews for most gps have had bad review around new york due to the tall building .
oh , the suction cup sucks could not hold on the windshield for anything keep dropping onto the dashboard after 10 seconds .
i just had to put down somewhere on the center console .
the screen reflection was not a big deal to me .
people complaint one way or another .
overall , if the price is right , this garmin can not be beat .
did lots of research on gps and is down to two garmin c330 and a tomtom .
went to circuit city to compare the units as research ratings were inconclusive one person said it is great , next one said it is junk .
while at circuit city two persons came up and gave unsolicited opinions on the garmin c330 , which were both very positive .
decided that is the unit for me based on their comments and that tomtom is consistently listed as having older maps .
ordered the garmin c330 on line .
upon arrival , it is very easy to set up .
everything worked fine for about three weeks , then on a business trip the unit froze up -LRB- just like some reviews said it would -RRB- .
first time i is able to turn it on then back on and it reset .
only missed one turn in the process .
a few hours later while returning home if froze up and would not rest -LRB- at least i knew how to get home by then -RRB- .
in fact it would not even turn off after being unplugged .
it ran on its battery until the next morning and it finally died .
recharged the unit and hooked it up to my home computer , went to the garmin website and downloaded software updates .
since that time no problems .
i travel a lot and so far it has gotten me where i need to go .
only once have i tried to find a street that was not listed and i frequently travel to relatively new roads so maps appear to be fairly current .
i would recommend this unit , but be sure to download software updates .
as a paramedic alone in a chase car i depend on gps in emergency driving after 30 days with my new 330 the touch screen froze and is unable to reset .
tech support is unable to solve the problem and i exchaged it for a new one .
they have had no other reports of touch screen failures .
aside from that one glitch love the garmin 330 and have not had any other problems .
a year ago i bought my first gps magellan 300 which i thought is excellent as my first experience .
it finally died last night , and received the garmin as a replacement right out of the box , it is much faster than my magellan , much faster to acquire sat signals .
the mph is accurate -LRB- on magellan it would say i is traveling 20mph while going 60 -RRB- .
i did have a hard time seeing my screen on the way to work , because of the sun , but the speed of it made up for it although you can not sort your favorites , you can hit the spell button and quickly find what you want a big problem with my magellan is that if i wanted to go to an address -LRB- without adding as a favorite -RRB- it would somtetimes direct me to the wrong location , and there would be no way to realize it is wrong until it is too late whereas after you enter a location on the garmin , you can have it show you the map of the end destination and from there you will know if it 's right or not -LRB- if you 're familiar with the area -RRB- one thing i do n't like is that it will not tell you what street you are on granted you should know what street you are on , but sometimes if you were to get off the freeway and turn on a street unless you looked at the sign , you do not know what street you are on .
the magellan listed the street you are on at the top , and what street to turn on at the bottom .
the garmin only tells you what street to turn on in route mode .
however , when you are not in route mode , it will tell you what street you are on , but i would love to see that while i 'm driving -LRB- to remember the street next time for detour purposes -RRB- overall i 'm impressed with it .
i walked into my apartment with it , still on , and continued to add favorites by just browsing the map and searching the pois .
granted i lose a few things above -LRB- screen , sort , map views , poi as you drive -RRB- but it being faster , more accurate , and it 's portability make up for it except the screen glare i 'll have to figure out what to do with that one .
i did a lot of research on gps before i decided on the c330 .
it has all the features that i need .
for the most part i like this unit .
it is compact and easy to use .
the screen does get a bit washed out in bright sunlight .
the big problem is that occasionally it comes up with a routing that is absolutely off the wall .
the problem solves itself when you ignore it and in moments , the unit recalibrates a new route that makes more sense .
in a strange area though , this could be a problem .
also , database for businesses is a bit lacking .
my goal with a nav system is to have an intuitive interface that is simple to use and accurate .
i originally bought the garmin quest , but returned it because of the screen size and user interface -LRB- i is also told that it is discontinued -RRB- .
i purchased the c330 a few weeks ago and have been very pleased with the front end and how the poi 's are catagorized .
it is also very nice that the maps are loaded in the unit and there is no unlocking from a desktop the real test is when i asked my wife and mother to get us to a local store -LRB- their tech accumen is not as advanced as mine , so they are good test pilots -RRB- .
they simply got directions and the unit guided the way the screen could do better in daylight , but if i point the unit towards me , it is acceptable .
i bought garmin c330 for my summer vacation from chicago to niagara falls .
i just put my hotel 's address and that is it .
i didnt have to update the maps or hook with my computer downloading the map .
i just took it out of box and attached on glass of my car .
you dont even need to open manual .
when you turn your garmin c330 , you will just think that you have using this for long time .
it is no brainer hey guy just like me , perfectly used it so can you .
i is new to car nav systems , but i did my research and got recommendations from friends before choosing the c330 .
i wanted a minimum of distraction from such a unit while driving .
after three months this unit has been an excellent choice when garmin says out of the box usage , that is what they mean .
it is amazingly simple to set up .
after only minutes i is entering some locations and my first time out is a breeze do not worry if you make a mistake , the unit corrects the directions and gets you back on the track .
the unit does get a bit confused at times , but it is nothing serious if you want a simple to use nav aid , this one will do it for you .
it is a bit pricey but some time shopping the net will get some attractive prices .
this is my first navi ever , but i 'm no stranger to it , i just never owned one till now .
for the features i is looking for , i narrowed my options to the garmin 2620 , garmin c330 , and megellan 700 .
needless to say the c330 is my pick i painstakinly reviewed these -LRB- 3 -RRB- gps items and read every review and feedback i could find , then combing the manufacturers websites for all specs and features , updates yaddy yadda , then i made a few trips to the store to get some hands on experience and feel of the products the c330 has a refreshing out of box experience .
it can be fired up right away to begin use .
i did not need to read the manual to start using it , the idiot proof interface makes it very easy to learn , which is a plus because my wife can use it when i 'm doing the driving .
the models that i also considered provided a little more features than the c330 , but they did not have an internal power source .
memory wise , the c330 has a 2 gig micro drive , which is quite adequate for all the us maps and any updates etc personally , my heart is set on the megallan 700 , but the cost and the fact that it only had 2 million poi -LRB- points of intrest -RRB- compared to garmin 5 million poi , turned me away from it .
of the -LRB- 3 -RRB- items i considered , the c330 is the only one that has a 100 % touch screen interface and the smallest size so that it can be mounted/stored anywhere .
gpss ' are not getting any bigger , with todays designers using micro/flash memory technology , our units will become more inconspicous .
the c330 can be a little difficult to see in the sunlight , but not too bad .
the megellan 700 and the garmin 2620 does have a port for an external antenna as well as the c330 , which can be had for about $ 20 from a third party source the manual is very easy to read and colorful , but i found that it is not indepth , some things i had to call garmin to clarify .
i is curious about the internal battery , that only they can change .
it would cost $ 125 just to send the unit in if it need work outside of the warranty period hopefully the battery will last about five years when i ready to upgrade garmin updated maps usually comes out every 10 14 months so one is due out any time now .
and it would cost me $ 75 to update the maps if i so desire .
if you plan to get one and you get it on or after the new maps release date , the upgrade would be free i 'm very please with the touch screen response and the layout out the maps , the the list of hotels resturants etc .
all w / phone numbers too .
the volume is great , as long as you 're not do 80mph w / your windows down .
it recognizes dirt roads also provided that the roads all existed before 2004 -LRB- the last map release date -RRB- i will not be redundant and mention all the other points that the previous reviews mention , but for the most part the -LRB- 3 4 -RRB- reviews before mine were accurate and very helpful the c330 does not display your elevation , which is nice to know when driving in the mountains this unit has its share of nuggets to find that will just leave you in amazment .
if i had to choose all over again i 'll still get the c330 buyers beware , if you purchace the more expensive model -LRB- c330 -RRB- it comes preloaded with all the maps so there is no need to be transfering data back and forth , but you do not get the software on city select cd rom .
if you opt for the cheaper version -LRB- c320 -RRB- you will get the the city select cd , because the intire map can not fit on that unit you 'll have to transfer data via memory card i 've also noticed that unless you are looking directly perpendicular to the screen , the colors do n't show correctly , in other words if you are the driver or passenger and you look at the screen at an angle , it will be still visible but the colors tend to wash out , sort of like with a laptop if the screen is not tilted right my experience with tech support is fair .
the wait time is a little lengthy , but once one the phone , they do n't try to rush you through your questions to get you off the phone .
i is helped adquately with all my questions a great advantage is the mounting flexability , any area of the windsheild , the dashbord or console -LRB- comes w/base mount -RRB- or as a handheld providing the internal battery does n't quit .
icons , splash screens and markers can by customerized via the garmin software on their website .
the images can be transported back and forth from the unit as bmp files and edited there are three ways to view the map .
1 -RRB- bird 's eye view with the map always facing north and the arrow/cursor moves as you drive 2 -RRB- bird 's eye view with the arrow remains still and the map moves around as you drive .
3 -RRB- 3d mode .
where the view is the same as you would see out of your winsheild except it 's slightly elevated so you can see a wider angle and detect streets about a block away an all three sides of you the unit automatically detects you speed and zooms out when you 're driving fast and zooms in when you 're moving slow so you 're never over/under driving the map .
the reciever is very good in my opinion , sometimes -LRB- depend on what part of the house i am -RRB- i get a good signal indoors .
i have my c330 mounted above my rearview mirror in my vehicle -LRB- bearly got it to fit -RRB- so it does not have a clear view of the sky and if it did , the factory tint in the windshield would also block it yet i get a good signal .
mounting it on the middle of my windsheild yeild the best results and start up time , but i chose to mount it abouve my reaview mirror to eliminate any sunlight glare from hitting the screen and it 's working great to respond to previous reviewers comments it is pointed out that garmin should 've added a feature where you can see an icon or marker that indicated the locations of all the poi nearby as you drive by them .
well i 've found a way to do it , although it 's not noted in garmin 's sub par manual .
all you have to do is go to -LSB- menu where to show map -RSB- and you see all the attractions , lodging , eating , gas etc .
locations on the road/area that you 're currently on another thing that 's not mentioned on the manual .
lets say you 're somewhere and you do not know the address , but you want to save and revisit that location .
go to -LSB- menu where to show map info save -RSB- .
bought this for my 17 yr old blonde daughter who gets lost after leaving the driveway installation is a no brainer .
plug it in and its ready to go .
set home address and it always remembers how to get you home .
put in destination addresses and driving instructions were right on .
i even tried to fool it and make a wrong turn on purpose .
recalculation of route is fast and accurate all that being said the touchscreen is very difficult to see in direct sunlight .
the glare is horrible off of it .
also makes you accept the disclaimer each and every time you turn it on the point of interest database is sorely lacking .
we live in the chicago suburban area .
the movie theater that is less than a mile away from us and has been in operation for over 5 years does not appear in the database .
that 's okay , its one of the places my daughter actually knows how to get to .
tried 5 other downtown chicago and suburban venues ; 4 did not appear after the database searched and searched and searched -LRB- over 5 minutes before i finally gave up -RRB- .
works fine , however , if you enter the actual address , which we had to do to get to certain restaurants/theaters/concert venues instructions on updating to latest software enhancements were horrible .
instructions on the garmin website were totally misleading .
emailed tech support and received the proper download/upgrade instructions in less than 24 hours -LRB- so give them a 10 for support -RRB- overall , this works great if you input the address of your destination .
no more worries about my daughter getting lost .
now , my wife wants one in her car .
i have found the garmin c330 very easy to setup and use .
it did not come with a manual -LRB- available online -RRB- and it is not necessary to use for the first time the mount is marvelous and has all of the adjustability one would want my issue is the pois .
it is supposed to have 6 million in the north american version .
the first day i used it i searched for a buffalo wild wings that has been open for two years .
it is not in the database .
i then searched for a kohl 's and sports authority that has also been open at least two years .
they were not in the database i tried to call and stayed on hold on the phone for 1 1/2 hour without talking to anyone .
i sent an email and is told that i could update the map and poi database for $ 69 .
this flabbergasted me because out of the box the pois were not up to date and they did not have a free download .
how about letting a new customer do that the first time especially when the database is out of date on the other hand , what i am afraid to do is spend the $ 70 .
00 and find that the 2008 version still does not have pois that are 4 miles from my house .
i do not live in wyoming , rather , new lenox , il which has a population of about 30 , 000 people .
over the course of 24 hours , i have used both the magellan 3100 and the garmin c330 .
whereas the magellan lacked canada , as well as schools and post office locations , it did allow you to place whatever points of interest you wanted to view right on the map you were watching .
simply touching the screen on a restuarant would give you the name of the establishment , their phone number and the distance to it .
it lacked however the ability to upgrade the maps and poi as well as being limited to 48 states .
i spent 20 minutes waiting for customer service to answer a few questions , and then could not understand the tech person on the other end the garmin is purchased as a trial unit to determine if it would be better than the magellan .
from what i know of garmin , it is an excellent company with a great customer service tech department .
i have used the etrex for close to 8 years however , i is suprised to see it is loaded with software that is relatively outdated .
i have not loaded the software disc , as i is not sure if i is going to keep the unit i do love the way the instructions are given , right on the path of travel , instead of on a split screen .
the text at the top of the screen is large and easy to read .
the dimmer control for night driving allowed a very unobtrusive view while traveling on route 80 .
the dial on the side for raising or lowering the voice instructions is much more convenient than a menu driven button that requires you to switch screens to lower the voice the simple mount for the car plugs into the power cord , instead of the power cord plugging into the unit .
if you simply wanted to take the unit to another car , you would have to also take the mount my biggest complaint along with other comments is that it does not allow an open view of the various points of interest along the route .
on the magellan 3100 , you could actually select an exit ramp poi button that would tell you all the points of interest at a particular exit i am considering using a tom tom one 3rd generation , but am still working out the particulars of the garmin c330 .
it is a great value for $ 178 .
00 and i would even consider giving it as a gift to other family members who do not have as many travel information needs as i do .
would be nice if the unit could be programed for the routes you would like to take .
but i did not want to move up into the $ 500 .
00 range .
i decided to purchase the garmin streetpilot c330 after using a tom tom go for 1 year .
i used the units side by side in my car for a day and found several differences that could mean alot to some people , and nothing to others the review .
first thing i did is enter an address for a local restaurant into both units .
pulled out of my driveway and proceeded to the highway .
this road is a 4 lane with a divider , and the streetpilot instructed me to turn left into oncoming traffic , at the same time the tom tom instructed me to do a u turn after turning right , the correct choice then i noticed that the map detail is quite different .
the streetpilot has beautiful graphics , however the map detail is not as accurate .
it would display this divided 4 lane highway as one yellow line .
the tom tom would show it as two divided lanes with little arrows to indicate flow of traffic , much nicer gps acquisition time is around 30 seconds faster with the tom tom .
and the map updates seem smoother as you 're moving the aesthetic design of both units is very good .
the streetpilot wins in this category though .
it has a volume knob instead of touchscreen control like the tom tom .
also the sd card slot is on the side , instead of the front , which smoothes it out a little .
the suction mount for auto mounting is nicer than the tom tom , but has the 12v lighter adapter permanently attached , so it 's clunkier the tom tom comes with a padded case included , where garmin will sell you one for $ 30 .
the tom tom comes with a wall charger , while the streetpilot allows you to charge via usb the streetpilot has many more pois -LRB- points of interest -RRB- which also include phone numbers .
the tom tom only shows the address of pois .
also the streetpilot allows you to categorize the pois by type , like fast food or asian where the tom tom only shows a long list the major flaw i see with the streetpilot is customization .
the tom tom allows you to customize virtually anything about the display , where you want the speed displayed , what colors you would like for maps .
the streetpilot is barely customizable , which is a major annoyance after using the tom tom for so long i really wanted to like the streetpilot more , and find a better gps .
but map accuracy/detail , and customizable menus win for me i wish these two companies would get together and make one gps with all these features , but that 's not likely to happen .
so for now i 'll be selling the streetpilot and sticking with my old trusty tom tom .
i used the system tonite for the first time .
it is very clear and loud which made the verbal commands very easy to understand .
at nite the screen is very clear to view and read .
i is a little bit disappointed because the instructions would only tell you to make rights and lefts .
i have used other systems where they also mention the name of the street or avenue to make the turns .
it is helpful finding the location .
if you want to know where to turn you have to read the name on the screen .
you can store your home address in the system making it easy to start your return trip .
i bought the gps system at circuit city although there were cheaper places to buy it on the cnet internet web site .
the downside of the cheaper locations is i never heard of those places and the salesman at circuit city said they may give you an older version and you would have to download a up to date version from the computer .
if you buy it from any store make sure you are getting the most up to date version to save you the trouble of downloading the newer version through your computer .
i also learned that circuit city prices for the unit is advertised cheaper on their web site than it is at the store .
the salesman matched their internet web price and even beat it by another $ 10 .
00 when i brought this to his attention .
he said many of their products are cheaper if you order it on line .
he also said you can pick it up at any of their stores or they could send it to you by delivery service .
i will have to use it additional times to form a firm opinion but it is easy to operate and i am pleased with my first trip dispite the fact that i had to look at the screen to get the names of the streets i is turning at .
bought it last friday and just returned it today .
we took it to houston , tx 1 .
lost signal very frequently in downtown houston , where we needed it the most 2 .
what turns us off the most is its voice direction .
it simply tells you in 2 miles , turn right , instead of turn right to .
road .
i have to constantly check the screen for distance and the road name .
this is not a safty friendly design 3 .
small screen that fades under sunshine it is not a desirable unit if you are driving alone .
my wife is assigned to monitor the screen for me during the trip it is a fair unit that is quite portable .
large number of points of interests and pretty good functions .
but with the current price , i would go with older top notch units , such as 2620 or cobra 3000 .
i picked up the c330 after my magellan rm700 burnt out during my 7 day vacation .
the c330 is very portable vs the magellan .
i like the button on the mount for easy removal and the attached cord is good cause the cord pulled o ut several times while i had the rm700 on .
the magellan mount also shakes too much .
i really like the c330 's battery and clock .
the time of arrival is pretty accurate vs rm700 which is awful .
a 2 hr trip turns out to be 3 hrs .
i am still getting used to the turning instructions from the garmin .
it counts down from 1 .
2 miles to 500ft to 200ft to 0ft which is very different from the rm700 where it warn s of a upcoming turn with the message approaching rt/lt turn and then chimes go off .
the garmin did not have that feature so i missed a few turns initally .
i really is bothered by the display not being visible while i had my polaroid sunglasses on .
unless you are looking perpendicular to it , the screen is black .
i guess they forgot to test this out on sunny days .
first , let me note that for basic auto use for getting you from where you currently are to someplace you want to go , the c330 is excellent .
a score of 10 .
easy to use mechanically and logically .
maps are clear , voice directions are excellent .
normal occasional map errors and weird routings , but really solid .
my wife , who has no aptitude for such devices not only can use it , but is using it but , i am basically an aviation gps user and so am used to certain capabilities that i did n't realize were advanced .
for example , there is no fast way to enter current location as a waypoint -LRB- like as you whiz pass an interesting location or view and want to log it . -RRB-
you can do it , but it is like a 12 button operation to get it in and back to the map again also , the c330 can not identify interesting landmarks along the way easily -LRB- requires a long transition to another set of screens sufficiently hard that i do n't really use -RRB- no actual latitude and longitude available for recording where you really are in a standard coordinate system .
no knots .
gps time only to the minute .
no instantaneous speed to the .
1 mph the automatic map scaling is almost perfect for road navigation but this feature makes using the c330 in an airplane mostly useless no way to see routing for going from point a to point b only from where you are to point b .
-LRB- at least i can not find this capability -RRB- .
and more stuff like no satelite positions and signal strengths , no bread crumbs for where you have been , occasional screwball max ever speeds -LRB- like 185 mph no i do not drive that fast -RRB- , limited city name labeling -LRB- i guess it assumes you basically know what city you are in -RRB- , no true north headings other than the 8 cardinal directions , no magnetic course , and more not worth listing anyway , this is not a general purpose gps .
it is really good at what it is designed to do give you road driving directions for getting from where you are to somewhere else .
good mount .
easy to lift out without hassling the suction cup .
good battery life .
good sound quality and volume -LRB- my wife likes listening to the italian and spanish and french -RRB- , good screen really easy to use we 're keeping it , but i may look at the 2620 or tomtom to see if one of them gives me some of the more general features without giving up too much on the driving direction quality .
i think the product is inferior in that you need to purchase an additional antenna .
garmin has admitted that their new products such as the nuvi series have better antennas in them .
this is my review from the c320 i have both the c320 and c330 .
the products are the same except for the hard drive vs the memory card .
the maps are easy to load , if you hve the c320 but if you just want a good out of box experience with little or no set up buy the c330 i like garmin products , i have owned the streetpilot iii , the 2610 , the c320 and c330 .
the c3xx -LRB- c330 and c320 -RRB- have some major issues which i hope they will fix soon garmin usually is very responsive and does provide updates .
the limitation is in looking up addresses , if you do not know the city the garmin has listed for an address you can not find it .
for example , someone may tell you the street you are looking for is in any town , pennsylvania .
the c3xx may know the address as my town pennsylvania and you will never find the address unless you enter mytown in the city search .
the garmin allows you to look up an address by all cities but i have found more than not the c3xx will not return the street you are looking for unless you enter mytown .
the 2610 and streetpilot iii in addition to the tomtom 700 allow you to filter based on zip code which will return the correct address the other problem with the garmin is with the navigation display .
i use the visual indicators to guide me on my turns .
while using these indicators i will position myself for a turn only to have the display change as i begin the turn and i am forced to pull back into traffic .
i have never had this problem with the streetpilot iii , i hope garmin can fix this problem soon because i think it could cause a serious accident the speakers on the c3xx are loud and clear and the unit is small and lightweight so traveling with it is easy .
even if you choose the 320 model the maps load easily onto the sd card , you can purchase a large card and load the entire country a nice change from the proprietary memory cards garmin used to use over all i prefer this gps over the other units i have tried so far , if tomtom cleans up some of the limitations they have before garmin makes their needed changes i may switch units and recommend the tomtom 700 over the garmin c3xx .
one other downside to the garmin series is the update maps are much more expensive than magellan and tomtom .
just to set the record straight the tomtom go comes with an internal battery and you can get different colored face plates direct from tomtom .
i do not own the c330 so i can not coment on it but i have a tomtom go that i have been using for 4 months and it does everything discribed in the review of the c330 and then some at a better price .
around $ 500 with rebate .
after reading all the reviews and user opinions , i went to the store to purchase the garmin c330 .
when i is testing the store display , i is not able to program several locations , including my own home address .
i contacted garmin and they were able to resolve every issue -LRB- with updated maps -RRB- except finding my home address on their database .
they admitted that it is not there .
while the garmin name may stand for quality , i have lost confidence in a company whose database can not recognize the address of a house that has been standing for more than 50 years .
other manufacturers have databases that do .
check it out for yourself before you buy .
if it gets you there but can not get you home , it is not very useful .
lowrance iway offers a nice unit for the car with a larger screen , a 20gb disk , and a lower price .
no contest .
you must have backup directions because this unit will leave you stranded and you will get so tired of hearing the voice say , lost satellite that you will want to throw it out the window .
if you have it programmed for an address , say in a congested area , it will lose signal and leave you wondering , which way do i go now .
no matter how easy a gps is to use or how fancy it is , if it puts you into untenable situations , it 's pretty worthless .
i never thought i 'd want/need a gps , but i started living and traveling full time on the road , so it became a real necessary tool .
and when you travel to strange places you need one , especially big cities .
and that 's where any gps will succeed or fail .
and this one failed big time in both big cities -LRB- new york -RRB- and small towns -LRB- williamsburg , va -RRB- .
i pull 60 ft of vehicle that 's nearly 13 ft high , and the truck setting on this device does not work .
it continually sends me to places trucks can not go .
plus , it tells me to turn down roads the wrong way , and it 's very inaccurate with where places are located .
i hope i can return this and get something more accurate .
i will certainly try the tom tom and look at more expensive garmins .
but this one is at best only a recommendation for something as a comparison with google maps , ms streets trips -LRB- which is also inaccurate -RRB- and city maps .
used this for one road trip to indiana .
tried to get me to use highways instead of interstate .
got me lost in two cities with bogus directions .
needless to say i returned it as soon as i found my way back home .
thank goodness for paper maps .
the garmin c330 is my first gps .
i is hoping for so much more .
i have had numerous problems with the mapping software being out of date .
i have done all the updates but it has n't helped .
it has gotten to the point that i do not even bother to use it most the time .
i just go to mapquest and print out directions on the positive side , it is very easy to use .
do not let it rest for too long .
once you start using it , do not stop .
i bought the streetpilot c330 from compusa in january , 2009 .
at $ 69 sounded like a great buy .
the unit is easy to use , good overall quality .
the first hint of trouble started when the unit could not pinpoint my home address .
i found out that the unit has outdated 2005 maps , very old for cities like orlando , florida .
i contacted garmin 's customer support .
i is told that garmin decided not to extend its new maps guarantee to an older product .
the new map warranty is only good on new products .
why would new product need new maps .
how convenient .
refurbish the old junk , sell it cheap , and sell the duped customer an expensive set of maps .
of course when you buy the unit they will tell you it 's as good as new .
i have had 2 units now .
absolute garbage and a half hour hold time with garmin is unacceptable ; probably because they keep producing faulty units .
my first unit froze while in the car during trips .
would not pick up satellites either .
second unit is sent as a replacement but is refurbished .
completely stopped working to no fault of mine when i went to use it on a trip .
a lot of good that did me .
then they tell me to hook it up to the computer which to me totally defeats the purpose of a gps .
i could just use mapquest while the dumb gps unit charges over night as recommended & i feel bad for the people on the tech lines at garmin because the company is producing crap .
i want a new , updated version of this unit .
3 units is unacceptable .
they do me no good with most of their time spent in the mail .
i wish i could get my money back to go with a tom tom or magellan .
i is extremely happy the first 10 days or less that i had this product .
then , while on a business trip which required me to travel around three counties in another state it stopped working .
in the course of a 9 hour day it may sync with a satellite for 5 minutes total and continually ask if i am indoors and the date .
no i did not drop it , yes my windshield is fine , yes i attempted numerous resets , and no garmin could not fix it and asked me to mail it in to be fixed .
for close to 500 bucks i would expect this product to work longer than 10 days and i plan to return it when i get home rather than pay out of pocket to get this thing shipped , fixed , or replaced .
for the price , i would recommend trying a different brand updated .
on jan 4 , 2010 .
this device can not be relied upon for safe , accurate navigation .
it does not recognize pa222 and pa100 .
it tells you to turn off the middle of the pa378 bridge into the lehigh river to get to places in bethlehem , pa .
it can not find a farmhouse with an address which is 100 years old .
it will route you through dangerous , narrow alleys to a friend 's house for five blocks rather than have you take the main road , with his house on the corner of the main road and the narrow alley .
folks , this is just one metro area and surrounding countryside .
i 'm not even trying to get to newly constructed dwellings , but rather long standing addresses .
you can not expect to enter your destination and get accurate guidance with the garmin c330 .
you will have to get your spouse or friend on your cell phone while you drive and have them guide you using an online map like maps dot google dot com and go road by road for the last 2 3 miles like i have had to do to find an address to be fair , i 'll mention this as you approach a turn , you are warned adequately so you can change lanes .
as you drive faster , it gives more lead time .
as you drive slower , the lead time diminishes sufficiently if you know a shorter , or quicker way to your destination , and you purposely miss a turn the gps tells you , it will say , recalculating , then give you new directions , but those will usually be to turn you around to where it wanted you to go originally overall , you can get generally within 2 3 miles of your destination with this gps , but have written maps and a cell phone handy .
after taking this on a trip to so cal frm northern nevada this device fails miserably 1 .
it did not have freeways that have been in place for years .
causing constant ` recalculating ' .
when a major route is closed -LRB- due to snow in our case hwy 88 -RRB- no amount of tampering could get the device to select an alternate -LRB- i80 -RRB- this nasty little flaw could leave people stranded in the freeking mountians to die 3 .
customer support , when told of the missing major routes , told me that that is why the model is so cheap -LRB- according to whose standards . -RRB-
and that i could get a lower 48 update -LRB- instaed of the north america maps -RRB- -LRB- for 39 .
00 -RRB- that would be more comprehensive 4 .
i assumed the update would be sent out soon as she said it would come ups i just found out that it will be a month or more before i see it i will never purchase a garmin product -LRB- this is a gift -RRB- they send a product out as new that does not have major california and nevada freeways on it , charge for a limited but more up to date map , then neglect to tell the customer it will arrive in about a month it 's a freeking cd , how long can that take .
i am giving this unit a poor rating primarily due to garmin 's bad customer service .
after waiting on hold for an hour i is transferred while waiting on hold for another 45 minutes to install an unlock code on the unit .
all i is trying to do is get my unit updated with the most current software after paying for the update , i received the software and is not able to unlock it .
they sent me the wrong update .
and after two attempts received the next update which also i is unable to unlock i is told by garmin that the unlock code with my unit is sufficient , however , i 'm not sure if that is true since the past 2 software shipments left me frustrated while attempting to install the unlock code unsuccessfully .
the customer service rep on the phone tried to sell me another upgrade however , i told him that is not an unacceptable alternative .
this unit is purchased a month ago and if an upgrade is available , it should be offered at no charge .
i already wasted $ 300 on the gps that i can not create a decent route with .
therefore it is virtually unusable to me the next gps i purchase will not be garmin .
i 'll cut my losses and try to sell this one on e bay or something .
4 people from my family bought the garmin c330 streetpilot .
the hard drive in every one of them crashed in matter of 3 months .
we all send them back to garmin for warranty repair .
my advise is to not to buy the garmin streetpilot c330 .
the concept of their design is good , but the actual product faild .
here s my story .
i got my street pilot after researching on the web i placed my order and with the excitement of a new toy and a long distance trip coming up to use it on anxiously followed the very limited -LRB- but very easy -RRB- instructions step by step after i connected the street pilot c330 as instructed , then registered , i tried out this wonder .
i is amazed at how easily you could give the address and tell it to go .
i thought wow , this is going to be wonderful .
finally , i won t get lost .
that is over 3 hours ago this thing still has a question mark with acquiring satellite to get an answer you can send an email and get an answer in 5 7 business days .
great customer service on top of an expensive , not to mention worthless toy .
save your money use mapquest & & & & .
or call me i ll sell you mine .
