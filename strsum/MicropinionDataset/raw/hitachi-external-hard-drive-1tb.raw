Pros:. It has never performed improperly.. 
Cons:. None to report.. 
Summary:. Unlike the 1TB Lacie I also own, which houses the same Hitachi drive, this external drive has performed perfectly.. Updated. on Aug 29, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. amazing drive as advertised. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. have been using the 1 tb drive from best buy since 2 weeks and it has been spectacular so far. performs like a champ, no complaints. only thing was that i really had to boot up and then format the whoel drive myself. but overall i called tech support and they totally sorted me out and my babay was ready to go.. 1 tb is like opening doors to my downloading like never before. so far put 700 gb on it. all brand new stuff man. thats my whole collection dude. going to see if i can dump something else on it too. its real tiny so it can fit in a bag. noiseless, stealth and cool with its red glow in the dark.. folks cant go wrong with this product.. go get it. i think cnet should rate this device higher.. 

$$;
Pros:. size is right, pretty cool (in style and temperature), made by a good company. 
Cons:. it's plastic, could have had a fan, could be smaller, can't get back-up button to work. 
Summary:. This is a great hard drive by a wonderful company that provides amazing customer service when needed. This unit is capable of fitting close to 1TB (little bit less, about 160GB cause it is formatted), in an enclosure that isn't so big.. The upsides of this unit are the capacity, price is not so bad, the enclosure looks nice, it is a quiet hard drive, that does not seem to overheat a whole lot.. There are some downsides to the unit, which is why I gave it four stars. These include that it is a plastic enclosure over aluminum or some material that might keep the drive a bit cooler, there is no fan built in even though there is space for one, and I have not been able to get the back-up button to work. Hitachi could have also added firewire or e-SATA to the drive, but it is ok cause Vist doesn;t seem to like firewire anyways.. The downsides are minimal, as the drive really stays somewhat cool, and the capacity, price, and brand name make it worth buying. It must also be kept in mind that since it is a 1TB hard drive, it may be a bit slow at saving or looking up data, but the speed is actually pretty good.". 

$$;
Pros:. less failure rate. 
Cons:. bit slow interface. 
Summary:. It took 60gb back up in about 20 hours ,I would have expected a bit faster performance of writing ! I have maxtor 100gb without external that is pretty faster than that ,I will buy simple tech raid also and compare with this if that is faster ! I cant predict reliability ,as the time factor grows ! but price should be no more than 220$ at the most !. 

$$;
Pros:. good hard drive. 
Cons:. none i can see. 
Summary:. i have 3 of them on ebay. casablanca-import $259 shipped.. 

$$;
Pros:. size physical and memory. 
Cons:. lil buggy at first, but could me using FAT32. 
Summary:. I love it, its about half the size of those TB stations, and works well. only personal issue is, i bought it for storage option for when i convert to a mac when leopard releases, but FAT32 only accepts 4gb files, something my 18gb videos from family events wont work with. so overall, its great, compact, and LOTS of room.. i cannot comment on the backup software but can only assume its good to go and standard.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Spacious. 
Cons:. Tends to become unstable if moved, FAT32 format. 
Summary:. I thought that this hard drive was very neat when I first purchased it. I liked how Hitachi made an external 1TB hard drive so compact. However, there's a problem with the stability of this external hard drive. At the slightest movement of the hard drive, my computer becomes UNABLE to detect the drive, and files I am downloading temporarily disappear.. This hard drive is far too fragile, and Hitachi should've done a better job of manufacturing it. The outer casing is not strong at all. For future reference, I would like to see Hitachi do a far better job making external hard drives, so when the hard drives are relocated by users, they won't become unstable and stop performing, as mine occasionally does. A good hard drive should always be detected, no matter where you put it on your desk.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice looking on the outside. 
Cons:. Some how messed my driver software on my vaio. 
Summary:. First of all this product seems to explain on the box and the papers inside that you get some sort of software, which was totally misconcieving and nowhere to be found....While my computer was already starting to have problems this seems to have made them worse...it seems to had failed my driver software and now I can't connect to the internet...and of course it's to late to return it....So Go figure!!! Very disapointing when you spend so much on something and it don't work properly!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast drive, 1TB of storage is nice.. 
Cons:. Overheats &#38; loud. I have a small CPU fan on it to keep it cool enought to run. The first drive I got died in less than 2 weeks, got the unit replace. This one is out of warranty and shuting down.. 

$$;
Pros:. None at all. Nada.. 
Cons:. External hard drive stopped functioning in less than 30 days. Could not recover data because warranty would be voided.. 
Summary:. Six printed pages of instructions to return product full of threats and demands. Packaging demands unreasonable could not be met by UPS or Mail Boxes Etc. Western Industries recommended but not listed in Denver, Colorado. Cost by Mail Boxes estimated at $65 for $100 DEFECTIVE product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice slim design, looks like something out of 2001 a Space Odyssey.. 
Cons:. Unstable drives, causes skipping and lost data. Design makes the hard drive flipped on its side giving it suspect performance at best.. 
Summary:. I have purchased many hard drives and I have found that it is mainly Hitachi drives that I have ever had a problem with. I decided to give this drive a chance because it was cheap and I thought maybe they got their act together and produced a stable product. However with all the debating and hesitation I decided to purchase this upright drive. It did the same as all the other Hitachi drives that I have used, it crashed. I realize these things happen, but to this degree and volume it cannot be tolerated. I lost over 500gb of data that cannot be replaced, or only at an astronomically high price. I would not recommend this product to anyone, not until they can improve their products, perhaps only in solid state drives. As an alliterative I have decided to go to the most trusted drive in my experience Seagate.. 

$$;
Pros:. I can thik of none.. 
Cons:. The first one failed in abot 6 months, the replacement failed in about 7 months and now it is nt under warranty. The tech said that they were having some problems with the drives but he could not help me in any way.. 
Summary:. I recommend that you stay away from this Hitachi drive as it does not have the stamina required for actual storage.. 

$$;
Pros:. This product has a large compacity for a low price.. 
Cons:. Breaks easily. 
Summary:. Had this hard drive for a little over a month. Was working great until it tipped over and fell (it was on the ground so it just fell on its side). It immediately stopped working. This hard drive is very easy to break and personally i would not recomend this drive to anyone who wants a cheap buy. The only pro in my situation is the customer service. They are great. I had a 650 GB hard drive and they are sending a 1TB to me. JUST BE VERY CAREFUL AS IT IS VERY FRAGILE!. 

$$;
Pros:. I can't think of a pro.. 
Cons:. See above, I wouldn't buy another Hitachi product for the rest of my life. I bought four of these when they were very expensive (nearly $259 each if I remember right).. 
Summary:. I bought two of these drives from a big box store and soon they started shutting down. To get them to start up again I had to turn the switch off and back on. Finally I took them back and exchanged them. They did the same thing, so I took them back for another exchange. The salesperson at the big box store suggested I take them out of the enclosure and put them in one that had a fan and some cooling. So, I did. But by doing so I voided the warranty. The failed in no time. I checked the serial number and it was still in warranty so I sent them to Hitachi after getting an RMA. They sent them back with the reason that I voided the warranty by removing them from the case. I tried to explain why I did that but they were unresponsive and did not offer any alternative to the problem. Just "sorry about that but that's our policy". 

$$;
Pros:. This disk crashed. It started making odd noises pretty soon after I bought it. Then it would go on and off line. Hitachi has never answered my mail on the subject.. 
Cons:. Crashes and takes all your data with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. large file storage capacity. 
Cons:. broke down in 5 days with no way to recover files. 
Summary:. This fell 1 foot off of my table onto padded floor and stopped working immediately. To recover files, geek squad wanted to charge 1500.00 for recovery as this was damaged from a simple fall onto the floor. Poor durability. Beware when purchasing this item. Going with a different brand is worth the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. OK for 30 min or so.. 
Cons:. Automatically dismounts/remounts every 30 min or so causing data loss and network shutdown.. 
Summary:. Numerous reports of this problem in multiple forums, including this one.. Read and learn: http://www.fatwallet.com/t/18/782358/. Drive shuts down and restarts every 30 min or so.. Data loss caused during reset.. Network interuption during reset.. Not an isolated problem, lots of reports.. But the really uncomplimentary part is,. 1. Hitachi tech support is aware of the issue and will not respond.. 2. CNet knew damn good and well it was happening when they wrote this report.. I don't trust either one of them now.. 

$$;
Pros:. None since it is unusable beyond 30 minutes. 
Cons:. You cannot play games on this drive or upload from it for longer than 30 minutes. 
Summary:. DO NOT BUY this drive! I am sorry I did; over $300 wasted! It turns off EVERY 30 minutes, meaning that:. 1. If you are playing a game installed on this drive, you will lose all progress and the game will shut down.. 2. If you are uploading from this drive, you better complete your upload in 30 minutes or less! If it takes longer, your upload will fail when the drive shuts down. In my case, "resume upload" didn't work, as the sudden cut-off of the transfer resulted in corrupt files.. 3. If you have any programs installed on this drive, you will lose all your work when the drive shuts down.. In short, this drive is pointless. Buy a Lacie instead, Lacie drives *just work*!. 

$$;
Pros:. It is small,. 
Cons:. Crashed with all my info on it.. 
Summary:. Does not work.. 

$$;
Pros:. None. Better options available. 
Cons:. Poor after sale service,. 
Summary:. I purchased this drive to back up my data and everything seemed fine until my computer crashed and had to restore my data. Not only was my data unaccessible, when I called customer service for warranty service, they declined because I could not find my sales receipt and they said the one year warranty had expired. I will NEVER buy a HITACHI drive again. I would recommend that when you purchase a hard drive, go with a vendor who offers more than a one year warrnanty because hard drives are prone to defects. Seagate offers a 5 year warranty and it will come in handy when you need support. STAY AWAY FROM HITACHI. YOU WILL REGRET IT.. 

$$;
Pros:. It looks cool. 
Cons:. Doesn't work. Nor do the 4 replacements I have had. When it does work it's slow. Runs very hot. drops connection to the PC constantly. Impossible to back up huge folders as this thing overheats and breaks down midway through...every time.. 
Summary:. This is probably the single worst piece of hardware I have ever had the misfortune to own. It feels cheap and it is. Unlike some other drives that will switch off when your PC does this drive stays on until you switch it off. It DOES NOT have a back up button - the button does nothing at all but look nice and the software installed is a joke. Aside from these minor issuees these drives just do not work. I have had 4 of them - all returned to Hitachi and replaced. I bought a 1 TB for piece of mind back-up and instead I got a piece of crap that has got my back up! Terrible - Hitachi should be ashamed of allowing such a half baked unit to be sold with there name on it. Oh - and it's slow too - don;t get suckered in by the CNET review. There aren't enough words to describe how bad this thing is. It's like a horrible joke that won't stop.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its Pretty. 
Cons:. Locks up my PC every chance it gets or when I can get it to actually hookup. 
Summary:. Have tried to get help from HITACHI with little success. 

$$;
Pros:. fast when it's running!. 
Cons:. disconnects every 30 seconds. 
Summary:. DO NOT BUY!!. This drive disconnects every 30 minutes and some how my itunes library was destroyed...I have a backup but lost some content!. DO NOT BUY!.
