a great design that will last for a long time  .
the hardware is good  .
excillent product  .
the software , however , is a little outdated which is expected  .
i cannot wait until they update the software  .
compared to the much more expensive indash $2000 gps , thier software accuracy is about the same  .
i can take the gps v where ever i want but the indash ones cannot  .
the refresh rate is a little slow too  .
for the money i spent on this versatile and intelligent (most of the time) product , i cannot complain  .
good job garmin  .
when you dont have time to look at a map while driving in a busy city this will be a life saver  .
it has an excellent battery life , excellent gps reception , accurate one    way road mapping and auto re    routing is good as well  .
only thing i dont like is that the display map can sometimes update a bit slowly due to processor speed but this is how they get an excellent battery life  .
i have used over 15 gps including the ones for the ipaq (which are very sad) and i would rate this as the best handheld by far .
with 19 megs of internal memory this compact unit is really worth its weight  .
use it in the car , then place it in pedestrian mode and walk around town with your location pin    pointed to within 10 feet with the waas enabled  .
bundled with the city guide software and turn by turn navigation you'll never get lost again .
check the internet out well , you can get free shipping at most gps specific sites , this is a great unit for the money if vehicle gps use is what you are looking for  .
it has great detail in the city mode  .
i use the garmin v on long distance cycling trips  .
it provides detailed information that goes way beyond longitude and latitude  .
sure , the ultra detailed maps are extra if you want the entire usa or world , however , the price seems fair  .
i had one occation where i needed customer support to deliver a cd to me on the road  .
they did it without batting an eye  .
it is express mailed to an address where i picked it up  .
being able to use topo maps and garmin's mapsource products at the same time on the same gps is a great feature  .
this is my third garmin  .
i do wish that it had a scratch pad for notes , but maybe that's coming .
i have three other gps units  .
this one blows them all away best value yet , you could spnd all the more for a street pilot but this one can do it all and in the palm of your hand  .
fits perfectly in my jeep and on my bike  .
used for geocaching and works great  .
best sat aquisition and accuracy of all my units  .
external antenna in my car makes it super accurate and responsive  .
if you are considering it dont hesitate buy it now  .
come with full unlock now so even more usable covering north america  .
only complaint slow serial transfer solution for big trips load info night before and your set  .
i turn it on in my car before i start the engine even when not navigating the map screen displays the next street ahead at all times garmin has out done itself this time  .
this is the last gps for a while unless garmin makes a better version of the v super unit  .
i use it for auto navigation , hiking camping , and finding my way around strange cities  .
it is easy to use , totally reliable , and integrates well with the pc  .
the pc software is a little confusing at first , but you get used to it  .
i wish you could show your tracks on a 3d relief map though (just for fun)  .
i also wish you could download 3rd party maps into it (like usgs topos) ; instead it uses a garmin proprietary format so you have to buy their cds  .
i think all the vendors do this though .
i have been using a gps v for several months now  .
with a few minor glitches , this is an outstanding product and an essential tool on my frequent trips throughout the u  .
of all the gadgets that i ever bought , this is by the far the best essential one .
it provides on the fly directions , and has the ability to recalculate on its own  .
it is very easy to see while driving , and is fairly accurate  .
the issues that i have come across with it have to do with loading routes from the pc to the unit  .
if this feature fails to work , it will never work  .
i contacted support about this issue and is told that the best way to handle this is to plot the route from unit and to ignore the route created on the pc  .
annoying , but not a deal breaker  .
the maps need to be more accurate also  .
there are sometimes 400feet off  .
other times they are accurate to within a few feet  .
overall , this is an excellent purchase .
i love it so much it has never let me down , anyone who wants it but does not want to spend an arm and a leg for a gps get this one  .
onlinemarine  .
com has them for the lowest i've seen  .
424  .
00 including shipping and handeling .
system   gps v and mapsource software  .
purchased about a month ago and have used it to locate and navigate to stores in st  .
louis and chicago , where i've never driven before  .
this gps took me to the stores , no problem , i is amazed  .
the cons have to do with the cartography software  .
the only places i had problems were on highways where construction recently finished or where the construction took me onto a detour whcih the gps diod not like  .
i emailed the cartography customer service and they replied that the software is expected to be updated later this year (whatever that means)  .
this is my first gps and i am impressed  .
i would recommend it to anyone who is planning to go to unfamiliar cities  .
i purchased it at http  //www  .
1st    gps    map    store  .
com where doug baker (the owner) is very knowledgeable and recommended the mapsource over the city select , which is very good advice .
pro   size , battery life , turn by turn instruction , easy to use  .
con   size of the display , take long time to calculate the route .
i love my gps v as my go    to all around gps solution  .
it mounts to my bike , in my car , on my sailboat , is small and will fit easily in small pockets in my hiking backpack and is lightweight  .
being water proof and very well built , it will take the knocks of being an active life gps and keep on ticking  .
the battery life is around 20    22 hours on alkaline aa , 24    26 on lithium aa either lasts long enough to leave the spare batteries at home when going out on a fresh pair  .
being very familiar with using garmin aviation gps units , i feel right at home with this unit  .
one garmin works like any other model  .
however , my wife has a hard time navigating through the multiple menus and options  .
it's not the quickest processor , takes a bit to get it to do what you want but cannot be beat for it's versatility  .
there are a good variey of maps avilable for it and has enough memory to handle reigonal activites  .
this is not a good unit for long distance (over 200 mile) trips as the memory is not large enough to support continually detailed maps that far out  .
i live in mi and it holds all of s mi (s of grand rapids to the state line , lake to lake)  .
the main drawback is that the screen is almost too small to use if you have to set it far back on your dashboard  .
small screen    small characters and icons  .
my nuvi 765t has taken over road trip duty but i'll never sell my gps v as i'm not worried about breaking it like i am my nuvi .
in short , this is the best unit you can get for the money  .
($230    500 range) there is only one other unit (from garmin , at least) that is more portable , that still possesses the route mapping feature of this one  .
(gps 60 and gps 72 series , http  //www  .
gpsnow  .
com/gmmap60cs  .
htm)  .
the screen is smaller , though , and i think the screen size on the gps    v probably about as small as i'd really want to go the 4    tone grey scale is a bit difficult to read at times  .
i found myself turning on the backlight  all  the time to be able to see the maps and menus easier also , the re    draw time is a bit sluggish when you're navigating in map    intensive areas  .
i think i'm going to look for a unit with a color screen for my next purchase  .
i've also become acustomed to my color screen on my palm pilot , though maybe i'm just spoiled the directions are pretty straight forward  .
i ran though a simulated drive (ie , from home to work) and it plotted the course exactly as i would have expected  .
it has pop    up warnings for each turn , and automatically adjusts the route if you miss a turn  .
other cool features are you can enter in a detour (  .
5 , 1 , 2 , 3 miles , etc) if you encounter road construction or traffic and it will find a new route  .
(there are newer models out there that can actually receive automated traffic info from fm receivers and automatically adjust for traffic)  .
you can always switch to off road navigating to travel by way    points for geocaching , hiking , etc the included map cd has a pretty extensive database of locations and points of interest  .
i searched for arby's and it brought up 8 separate locations , all within 5 miles of my house  .
to date , i have been unable to locate an arby's in chicago on my own  .
score apparently the battery life is ~20 hours  .
keep in mind that this will be less if using the backlight frequently  .
there is a battery saving use indoors feature that saves power while you're tinkering and route    planning indoors (turns off active searching for satellites)  .
there's also the ability to turn off the waas function , which gives you a little less accuracy , but speeds re    drawing time and lessens burdon on the processor , and thus battery life  .
you can keep batteries in while the cigarette lighter adapter is in use , and just use the batteries for back    up if desired  .
if i take this on any camping trips , though , i'm definitely bringing 4 extra aa batteries map space is another issue  .
this unit has 19mb of space for maps  .
it's definitly enough for 1    2 large metropolitan areas  .
(i plugged in chicago and las vegas) , but any more than that and you're out of luck  .
most of the newer models have around 120mb of space and some don't even require you to upload maps to the unit , becuase they're already stocked with the full detail basemap  .
many of the other in    between sized units at least have an expansion card slot but this one does not  .
all in all , not a big deal just requires some more planning before you hit the road  .
(or you have to bring your laptop with you) this unit came with the serial port version of the transfer cable  .
to load chicago and vegas (15mb of maps) to the unit took twenty eight minutes  .
that is painful  .
so , i would also recommend looking for a unit with a usb trasnfer cable not a  huge  deal , but newer units come with electonic compass and barometric altimeters  .
basically , you have to be moving at least 2mph to get a compass heading with this unit  .
units with the electronic compass can give you a heading while standing still  .
the altimeter is not that important , but in low reception areas where you cannot get 3d plotting , your altitude can be way off  .
the gps v makes up for the altitude issue by allowing you to enter in a known (or estimated) altitude to help maximize your 2d position so , in summary , i'm very happy with my gps    v  .
it will definitely provide you years of enjoyment  .
although this one is a gift , it is probably the unit i would have purchased , had i talked myself into believing that i had enough money in my bank account to afford a personal navigation device of my own .
the gps v i bought on e    bay for only 150$ is a great deal  .
the maps are easy to read  .
the options are endless  .
and it only takes a day or so to learn everything about the gps system  .
the detailed maps you can download to the device are expensive unless you use the old version included downloading maps are horrible it took 30 minutes to download 3 megs of maps to the reciver  .
also slow is routing , displaying maps , and zooming sometimes the accuracy of the mapping device is off  .
i will be driving down the freeway but the ap shows me 100 ft to the left or right side of it but this device is worth to me 250$ for how much it does do .
i used it for offroading , travelling downtown with addition external antena , never let me down or lost  .
prior to purchasing my gps v , i tried the magellan meridian gps but i returned it because did not like the fact that it did not have the auto routing features that the gps v has  .
this is a good unit that i recommend if its primary usage will be on a vehicule  .
here are the pros      autorouting features    good precisions of the unit and maps    solid unit    good screen resolution (but small) and the cons      slow to process routes and to redraw maps    the map details do not cover much area in canada as compared to magellan mapsend which is very complete  .
only major cities are covered  .
no possibility to add memory  .
the 19 mb is only sufficient for two large city and there is not much left for anything else  .
garmin should use standard sd memory cards in their units  .
very slow uploading process   uploading the 19 mb takes approximately 55 minutes at the fastest 115 , 200 mbs xfer rate    no auto    off feature    the user interface is not as well designed as the magellan unit    no possibility to convert a trail to a route as the magellan unit does    small screen    sometimes gives wrong routing especially when going from city tu rural locations (montreal to the northern rural areas)  .
my garmin v somtime hang when it have made a turn by turn and the recalculation is somtime very slow  .
but i am very happy to have it  .
if garmin is able to fix thise minuses it will be a great gps  .
my third garmin gps in the past 8 years  .
accuracy is nothing short of amazing with waas enabled  .
needs more memory  .
map redraws a bit slow .
i had the sp iii and found it to be too big on my dash  .
i loved the color screen and the size of the screen , but it just took up too much space , and it could not be used other than in the car  .
enter the gps v  .
the size is great , the screen , although small is perfectly readable , and the routing and audible alerts are great  .
while i do miss the voice prompts of the sp iii , i am more than happy with this unit .
i am the most disoriented guy in the world and when i am driving on an unfamiliar road    well , sometimes even he cannot save me  .
but only until i got my hands on this little wonder  .
garmin has manufactured this product especially for guys like me  .
it is extremely accurate and the battery power is great too  .
it comes with city select maps on a cd (you can activate only one region though    for activating other regions , you have to pay) and a car adapter + car    mount  .
the control buttons are fairly user    friendly and the instrument locks on to the satellites in a jiffy  .
it warns you (by way of audible beeps) of an upcoming turn and if you miss it , it recalculates and re    directs you to your destination  .
you can actually input an address and it will take you there or if you choose , a waypoint or a place of interest  .
recently when i lost my way in downtown toronto and wanted to get to my destination , i is amazed beyond words when it once warned me to keep left on a particular road which led to a highway only to find out that the left lane took me to dvp northbound exactly where my destination was  .
it keeps a log of all the roads you have traveled which might be helpful for some because you can download these tracks onto your computer , configure the downloaded routes according to your needs (for example , giving user    friendly names to waypoints destinations) and then upload it back to gps v  .
the ease of marking a waypoint while driving is not bad too  .
a zoom in/out function gives you the luxury of having a closer look of your surroundings and if you fancy having a peek at its little beauties , hook it up to a laptop while somebody else is driving and it will give you a real    time reading of your direction bearing , speed and a detailed surrounding street map  .
you can actually see a red dart (your car) sliding away hastily on a street and you can have a very good idea of all the upcoming roads and turns  .
this unit comes with innumerable options to configure    and garmin has done it so well that it could get away with murder  .
in a search for gps on the net , i is lucky to find www  .
gpscentral  .
ca which boasts of great prices and great service which is absolutely true  .
once again    hats off to garmin for making this unit although they could have easily thrown in a full set of maps with the price tag it comes with  .
and of course , thanks to gpscentral for the prompt and efficient service    i will never lose my way again .
the gps v does everything you would expect except talk  .
the detail of the uk (city select) mapping is amazing  .
just the sort of thing q would have presented james bond with .
i bought this as an upgrade to a garmin gps iii+ and it certainly is an upgrade  .
the screen is more legible and the maps are much more accurate and complete , in most areas  .
the receiver and positioning part of the system are great , it locks on fairly fast and provides good positional accuracy  .
the routing calculations are slow and occasionaly eccentric , it will sometimes tell you to go straight through a junction then turn right three times instead of turning left  .
the next day it will tell you to turn left , even though you have asked for exactly the same destination from the same start point  .
the screen refresh is sometimes so slow that you have no useful on screen guidance at a turn  .
if your route has a left followed a few hundred feet later by a right it may well show you the left turn again  .
sometimes a reroute crashes and you have to start again  .
loading 19mb of maps takes around an hour  .
the latest update , v2  .
50 , is a year and a half old  .
if you are travelling between two areas for which wou have loaded maps and the logical route takes in a section of the base map the unit will route you via the loaded map areas , even though the route is ridiculous  .
as an example i loaded maps for the san francisco , sacramento and mendocino areas then drove to willits which is about 125 miles north of san francisco on us101  .
for the return trip i plugged in my home address and got an estimate of about five hours  .
instead of just running straight back down 101 it took me over towards sacramento where the loaded maps touched , that's nearly 100 miles off track  .
i reported the faults to garmin a year ago , but since then there has been no update so i guess they don't do software quality still , at the current prices this is a good unit if you want something hand portable that will also have a good go at finding you a route  .
mostly my issues with it are niggles  .
but now i want something better for the car and i do not think garmin are on my list any more .
it needs more memory  .
the gpsv does all that it says it will , perfect directions and turn by turn is wonderfull .
this is an issue about the gps v that i wrote                                                                                                                                                      mountainwings a mountainwings moment #1313 wings over the mountains of life                                                                                                                                                    gps          i am a gadget man  .
i don't have much in terms of jewelry , virtually none in fact  .
i don't have a fancy house or wear fancy clothes (except sunday)  .
i do have a lot of gadgets  .
i bought a new gps unit  .
a gps unit is a global positioning system receiver  .
the gps system is developed by the military to guide missles to their targets and other military things  .
it's the system that allows you to determine exactly where you are anywhere on earth  .
gps allows cars with built    in navigation systems to direct you to where you are going  .
this unit , a garmin gpsv , sits on the dash of the car  .
i loaded the detailed map of atlanta and is ready for the unit to tell me how to get anywhere in the city that i wanted to go  .
i tested it with places where i knew where i is going  .
it directed me there perfectly  .
telling me in advance which way to turn and how far i had to go before the next turn  .
my confidence grew in the gpsv and its ability to lead me where i wanted to go  .
a couple of things that the manual didn't tell me were quickly answered by tech support and i is now navigating with ease  .
this makes it easy as i travel  .
i can download the map of the city that i am going to before i leave  .
when i get there and rent a car , i just put the unit on the dash , program where i am going , and let it tell me how to get there  .
today , my wife asked me to drive her to the doctor  .
she is 7 months pregnant and wanted me to drive her  .
i told her ok  .
the appointment is at 10am and she asked me to come home by 9  15  .
i had an early morning meeting and left the meeting in time to arrive home in ample time  .
the doctor had moved since my wife last saw him  .
she had a general idea where to go and had even printed out computer directions from a mapping service on the internet  .
i entered the address into gpsv and punched goto  .
are you sure that thing works  .
my wife asked  .
yes , i'm sure it will take us straight there , i replied  .
my computer directions say we will get there in 30 minutes and i don't want to be late , my wife commented  .
it is 9  25 as we were leaving  .
the computer directions would have us there by 9  55 if there were no traffic snarls  .
this will get us there puddin , i said as we drove away and the gpsv locked on the satellites  .
we got to the expressway , the gpsv said to go west , puddin's computer sheet said to go east  .
puddin raised a concerned eyebrow as i headed west ; the arrow on the gpsv is steadily pointing west  .
it took us to a back road  .
puddin sat up with a furrowed brow  .
i've never been this way before  .
this doesn't look right  .
i am going to be late  .
she exclaimed  .
i hadn't been that way before either  .
the path did look unfamiliar and somewhat suspect  .
the gpsv twisted and turned as it took us through a labyrinth of roads  .
puddin got increasingly anxious  .
didn't you want me to drive you  .
i asked  .
yes , but it looks like that thing doesn't know where it's going and i think we are going in circles , she said  .
sit back and relax , not only will you get there , but you will get there early  .
this is a lesson in life  .
it is a little thing  .
worry won't help  .
you don't have to drive , just relax , i will get you there , i said  .
puddin is sitting straight up  .
she and a 7    month    old baby in the womb were on edge  .
i stopped the jeep  .
lean the seat back and relax , i said  .
i don't want to lean back , i don't want to relax , and we are going to be late  .
if you don't lean the seat back , i will pull the jeep into that parking lot and not move until you lean back and relax , i insisted  .
reluctantly , under the threat of not moving at all , puddin leaned the seat back  .
now close your eyes  .
i don't want to close my eyes  .
eyes closed or parking lot , i said  .
we pulled into the parking lot of the doctor's building at 9  42am , 13 minutes ahead and almost twice as fast as the computer's directions  .
the little gpsv accurately led us the shortest and fastest way to our destination  .
we need to rely more on gps  .
not the global positioning system , but the god positioning system  .
we don't know all of the roads  .
we don't know the shortest route  .
we cannot see an overview of all of the territory  .
if we just learn to depend upon the right kind of gps , follow the directions , and relax along the way , it would make all of our journeys a lot smoother  .
i am sitting here in the doctor's office now typing this issue on my laptop  .
the doctor has not come into the examination room yet  .
it's 10  55  .
puddin is getting antsy again  .
i can almost hear god telling some of you now   sit back and relax , not only will you get there , but you will get there early  .
this is a lesson in life  .
it is a little thing  .
worry won't help  .
you don't have to drive , just relax , i will get you there  .
if you do not learn to relax and trust me , i will pull over and leave you parked until you have faith enough  .
you are not going in circles , though you often think that you are  .
you will get there , though it may not be in the timing that you choose  .
you do need to close your eyes and relax while the right gps system works  .
as the doctor's lateness nears the 1    hour mark , i tell puddin again as i tell you  .
this is a lesson in life  .
sit back , close your eyes , and relax  .
a mountainwings original  .
i purchased this unit along with additional mapsource software to use with my laptop  .
included with that package is a nine pin (female) serial connector  .
my laptop (and most , according to garmin technicians) does not have a serial port  .
i have purchased several usb converters (including garmin's) and none of them have worked with the unit  .
garmin technicians told me that there is only a 40% chance that the usd connection will ever work  .
today i purchased a pcmcia data card serial adaptor and i hope that this works  .
get with the times garmin , how about selling a usb or hotwire connection  .
i would have paid extra for this option  .
garmin is going the way of apple and my prediction is that they will price themselves out of the market  .
if you nickle and dime your coustomers they will leave you wake up garmin  .
i really like my gps    v but the fixed internal memory , 19meg , limits me to how much map i can load  .
example ; i have most of the san francisco bay area but when i needed to go to santa cruz i didn't have detailed maps because i did not have enough time to load them via the serial port before leaving  .
i sure wish it had a compact flash slot .
no expansion is a key feature for any serious piece of junk  .
anything near the $500 mark had better be expandable  .
maps are extra  .
how much extra  .
