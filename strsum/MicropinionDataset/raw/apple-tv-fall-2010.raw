$$;
Pros:. Dead simple setup. Easily streams media (music, video, photos) from my computer. Great price. Very nice Netflix interface. YouTube access is very good as well. 
Cons:. Wish it had access to Hulu. Also wish it had access to the major networks web sites or had iPad like applications (hopefully will come sometime soon). Being able to rent movies and TVs is a snap. 
Summary:. Super clean and easy to use product. There seems to be a ton of potential as well. I like that it can easily access all of my media on my computer (through iTunes) as well as the Netflix and YouTube access. Can't wait to see what the future brings.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gets iTunes onto my HDTV via streaming; review and rent movies directly from iTunes and Netflix; watch youtube, if you're into that; simple to use!. 
Cons:. Have to wait for Airplay, which is do out in November. 
Summary:. If you are looking to find this in the big-chain stores, you won't. Go to the Apple store and buy it online - took about two weeks to receive from the time of ordering, but was worth the wait!. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of set up and use, netflix streaming, itunes streaming, cost to buy and cost of operation, overall design, and iOS based system that almost without question will have more content as the months progress.. 
Cons:. The cons are not so much cons, more than they are annoyances, i.e. the supplied remote is adequate, but will force you to shut the lid on your macbook, as it will control front row, and itunes. The "remote" app takes care of this without a hiccup.. 

$$;
Pros:. FAST and SUPER small form factor, wireless N, iphone/ipod controller function is very nice, no longer a hot plate. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. This thing is FAST. Owners/users of the first generation appletv will really appreciate this. As soon as you rent a movie, play a netflix item, or stream something from your computer, its starts almost instantly, there is virtually no buffer time at all. (I'm on a 10mb down cable line). The iphone/ipod controller function is a welcome and makes the remote that comes with it collect dust. I can't wait to see when the Airplay functions comes later this month, I will update my review again when i get the chance to play with that feature, but even without it I am still very happy with my purchase. Best $100 I ever spent with apple!. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Quick Set Up, Big Bang For The Buck. 
Cons:. Not too many choices on TV Rentals (YET), Having to input email/passwords by scrolling letter to letter. 
Summary:. I do not usually review products. If I like it, great, if not, so be it. But I feel I need to make it known my feelings on this product. I got it today. I had it set up in under 5 minutes. The way it streams videos from the internet is unsurpassed. I recently subscribed to Netflix. I also have a PS3 that I used to stream instant movies. With the PS3, I often would have to wait for the movie to load, and during the movie, sometimes it would pause to load some more. But with AppleTV, I have yet to encounter that.. It also upscales movies to Full 1080p HD. It also streams movies from the computer, much like front row.. I can't wait until more companies sign on to Apple to share their shows. It's not a question of if they will, but when they will. And it will add to the usefulness of AppleTV just that much more.. I didn't want to buy the original AppleTV. To me, it just seemed useless, pointless, and nothing that I couldn't do with a cable running from my computer to my TV. But the truth is, the picture and sound always ended up being joggy, and unwatchable if trying to watch a movie. While I will still have to do that when i want to put my computer screen up on the TV, for media, the new AppleTV cannot be beat. I bought it as an impulse buy, but now I can't be happier with it!. But I will say this. Don't wait until they decide to hop on the iTunes rental program. This, right now, is a great worthy product. But the addition of more programs and the coming update for AirTunes, will only make this that much more valuable.. 

$$;
Pros:. It streams my iTunes library much faster than the previous version. The 720p gives my previous version's 1080p a run for its money. Looks great!. 
Cons:. none for the moment.. 
Summary:. You can't go wrong here. It's inexpensive, very fast, and rentals from Netflix or the iTunes store is flawless from a huge library.. 

$$;
Pros:. Faster, Smaller, Cheaper! I've been wanting to get an ATV but have waited until now. I don't care about buying content on the device if it keeps the price low. If I need to buy, I'll buy a real copy from Wal-Mart and rip it myself --&gt; then stream it!. 
Cons:. No customer accessible USB port to add a hard drive to. This isn't really a big deal though as streaming takes care of what I need to do. One thing I always wanted in an ATV was a blu-ray drive but that would never happen and would've made it more $!. 
Summary:. In order for this to become a success, Apple needed to get the price to $99. I think it's an impulse buy now for those buying a computer or even an iPad. With 8GB of onboard storage, we'll be getting Apps on this and this will become the box that can do it all. Any shortcomings on TV rentals will disappear as networks offer their own apps.. I own a lot of DVDs that I've ripped and just want to be able to use on either TV (I have two 50" HDTVs) and I have a Mac Mini on one room. I like it but you still have to use a mouse and keyboard to get things started. Also, the setup is too cumbersome to tote back and forth from livingroom and bedroom. The AppleTV however will very portable and I'll be able to move it back and forth with ease. Mainly I just want to be able to stream whatever I have to either set and the ATV lets me do this without any problems and is much cheaper than investing in another Mini which is what I've been thinking of doing.. I think that Apple has finally the hardware and software just right to get these into millions of homes. I think that with an App store, this would just be a magical device!. 

$$;
Pros:. Best user experience, great industrial design, low price, best implementation of Netflix streaming. Seamless integration with iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. In November Airplay will change how we use our HDTV's forever.. 
Cons:. Attempt by Hollywood to hamstring the device by limiting available content. No downloadable apps (yet).. 
Summary:. The new Apple TV is a terrific device that will only get better over time. When iOS 4.2 enables full Airplay functionality in November, the iOS user base will snap up Apple TVs by the millions. Apple TV will be the must have accessory for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. A perfect stocking stuffer.. Once the user base is large enough, Hollywood will be forced to cave and a flood of rental content will become available. Apple's strategy is very crafty.. I own a Roku (for Netflix streaming) and a first gen Apple TV. Roku's user experience is awful. Now that Apple TV offers Netflix streaming, I can replace two devices with one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Airplay allows streaming music and movies from iTunes.. 
Cons:. None right now.. 
Summary:. A small well designed device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, easy setup, great picture, smooth interface, great price. 
Cons:. None right now.. 
Summary:. I got mine yesterday in the mail and was eager to set it up right away. I had done everything and was excited to see how my content in my iTunes library looked on it. To my dismay, the Apple TV only recognized my wife's computer which only has music on it. I got on some discussion boards to see if maybe my laptop needed to be connect to my airport extreme, which would've sucked. I found out that there was a new version of iTunes that was required for the Apple TV to recognize my laptop. I updated it and within a few minutes, I was basking in all its glory. Netflix content looks great also. To the reviewers that are saying it's not full HD, you can't tell the difference unless you are watching it on a super big screen. I have a 37" Toshiba and it looks just like HD content on tv.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size is amazing and the air play is fantastic, who cares if it doesn't store movies on the device when you have a computer that can store 10 times the amount and more.. 
Cons:. No Bluetooth that would have been great so you could use a wireless keyboard would be nice. 
Summary:. Bottom line it's a great device and small around 25% of the size of the Boxee unit. I think it will be a big game changer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small and silent. Other than the small white light on the front, near invisible. Netflix interface is the best I've used. Wonderfully easy to control and navigate using the Remote app.. 
Cons:. Wish it had a bit more content but I'm confident that will come soon.. 
Summary:. Will probably purchase another just to get rid of the bad netflix interface on the other streaming device in the house. I'll be interested in how Apple expands the functionality as the internal components are the same as an iPad. For $99, it's a great device.. 

$$;
Pros:. 10 minute set-up with moderate A/V knowledge. HDMI to TV, Optical chord to speakers, download latest version of iTunes, enable home sharing and your good to go. The chords and router which you may already own, are more expensive than the device.. 
Cons:. No volume control means fumbling two remotes. Library not yet fully stocked. Some may ask "what else?" when it comes to features. Problems with. 
Summary:. Consider this a new product line with extremely low barriers to entry . More network deals and software updates will evolve this into a must have over the next 12 months. For now, this is one of the best ways to see your Netflix instant queue on your big screen and if you don't mind using your Mac or PC as a library, this is the best way to play your movies and music using your home theater.. Now that I can so easily play media from my computer on the big screen, it finally makes sense to buy high-quality movies and tv shows with replay value from iTunes as opposed to buying blu-rays/dvds.. First they got all my music purchases, haven't bought a cd in years. Then they get all my gaming purchases through their app store -- I've stopped using console and handheld gaming systems thanks to the iphone and ipad. Now they'll get my movie dollars, too.. It sounds like the folks at apple have realized hat its about media spending market share. They cancharge $100 bucks for a cool new device; the real money is in their cut of the $500 plus/year those folks will spend on purchases and rentals. And the customers don't mind, because we were spending it anyway!. Welcome to 2010.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fairly easy set up. Need to update Itunes before it can work. Open home shareing .... done. Remote is easy if your used to an ipod. GOT MY MUSIC TO MY HOME THEATER SYSTEM!. 
Cons:. You NEED to disable the IR reciever on your IMAC -remote works on it too. Reason: you have 1 file on Apple TV and FRONT ROW on the computer. May need to Deauthoize your computer and Reauthorize it - you may not be able to play back everything.. 
Summary:. GREAT PRICE! EASY SET UP! SIMPLE SOULUTION FOR MEDIA THROUGH YOUR HT SYSTEM!. 

$$;
Pros:. Interface is really great, finally gives me the interface to get the full power of the media I already have. Others have never been able to do that. Picture quality is very good, even at 1280x720 HD.. 
Cons:. Lack of media like Pandora, MLB, Amazon, etc. is a negative. On Netflix the box does not show all programing info as it does on the Roku. Apple leaves out the HD info if the programing is available in HD. On iToons that info is available.. 
Summary:. I would have given it 5 stars if it would only get all the internet media available, as well as present all info that the programer provides. Over all the unit is well designed and integrates well with the computers that I have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Setup was very simple. Streams NetFlix perfectly and the NetFlix interface is superior making it very easy to search for movies and tv shows. It immediately found my MacBook Pro and my Sony Laptop and smoothly streams my content on those machines.. 
Cons:. More television content. Currently has ABC, Disney, Fox and the BBC. NBC, CBS, A&#38;E, Discovery, History etc would really make Apple TV a "must have" product. Hulu Plus would be a welcome addition as well and fill in some of the gaps.. 
Summary:. I'm very happy with the product. I own two and we've been streaming NetFlix on them both at the same time without a hitch. I'm looking forward to more networks making their content available. I was surprised to find that some very current movies still in their theater run are available. Those movies run $7.99 (HD). All the other HD movies run $3.99 to $4.99. 

$$;
Pros:. Good image quality. Very easy setup (even easier when connecting to Airport wireless). Flawless. 
Cons:. Too proprietary with apple rentals.... 
Summary:. Just bought apple tv today in Canada. Very positively surprised at newer version of this apple TV. I have used it so far in conjunction with Netflix, and works like a charm. Very easy to add an Itunes library, setting up to a wireless network is hassle free, and can't wait to see Apple adding newer stuff later on with eventual software upgrades. So far I give it a good thumbs up.....!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to set up. Varying picture quality depending on source. Very convenient to use and plenty of stuff to watch - at least at first. Netflix movies come across well....... 
Cons:. The name of the game is money. Everything comes with a price tag unless you REALLY look. ITouch apps vary from free UP. Jobs is after your wallet and the Apple TV is like a printer - cheap to buy, but pricey to maintain.. 
Summary:. Apple TV is worth the money in terms of looks, convenience and limited content. I hope Apple will increase its sources and gives more content for free (or low cost) instead of grabbing for all th bucks.. 

$$;
Pros:. i've used medialink to stream my mac =&gt; ps3 =&gt; tv with mixed results. "file not found" and folders simply not seen are it's kinks, apparently. so the apple tv would be the 100% solution for moving pics and music from you computer to your tv.. 
Cons:. since i already have netflix streaming, i looked at the itunes store and it's incredibly anemic in comparison.. 
Summary:. bottom line is that this would be a nice product for streaming my iphoto and itunes music. it's incomplete, though, since it will not transfer most of my video collection. and the itunes store is frankly a joke. netflix is THE solution here, so i'll probably stick with the hiccups i get from the software solution i've found in medialink.. 

$$;
Pros:. The set up was very easy and quick. It takes varies little space. I like the remote is beautiful and functional.. 
Cons:. I was eager to use the Netflix feature. I was dissatisfied with the timing of the string. The playback was delayed frequently bad performance. I had hoped to replace a Roku with the new Apple TV it does not appear that I will be able to do that.. 

$$;
Pros:. Features as advertised (compact, wireless, no harddrive, HDMI output...). 
Cons:. Lack of FULL HD (1080p) support.. 
Summary:. ATTENTION: *Apple TV* buyers don?t be fooled!!!!!!!. It?s not FULL HD! It?s only 720p (not 1080p), which is a waste if you?re buying it for FULL HD. Wait until the FULL HD model is released. DON?T WASTE YOUR $$$ just yet. Why would Apple do this and give us only 720p?. 

$$;
Pros:. Small. Uses less energy and doesn't get burning hot like the 1st generation. Syncs all of your iTunes Media to your TV without wires. Nicely priced. 
Cons:. So limited in what it can stream. not 1080P. 
Summary:. So I originally was buying this for my Dad at the Apple Store in NYC and the salesman came up to me and started to gushing over how it was so small. I asked him what it could stream and how it was better then the 1st generation and he had nothing to say besides the form factor. This conservation could sum up all of Apple's products.. If Energy bills are a huge deal, this little guy is great because it only uses 6watts of energy. the size is the most impressive aspect of the device. The 1st generation was roughly the same size of the new Mac Mini. The price is great until you realize the the Roku box is the same price and has many more streaming options.. I decided not to buy the Apple TV and bought a refurbished Apple Mac Mini for $600, I figured you will most likely pay $60 for a DVD player, $100 for Apple TV or Roku, and $440 for a computer that can burn and rip DVD/CDs, play almost any kind of audio or video, gives you multiple media playback options, can store all of your movie/pictures/music, and it is in 1080P. Now everyone doesn't need or can afford a $600-700 media streamer but in my case I use it as a desktop as well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up. Simply interface. 
Cons:. Time consuming to enter passwords and user data.. Poor selection of movies.. Over-priced rental content. (Cheaper to buy the full DVD than to rent in many cases!). 
Summary:. If you have lots of video and music on your home computer/network then it's great as a streaming device with optical and HDMI output. But as a stand-alone rental device for movies/TV shows it is is quite simply... APPALLING. Why? Limited selection of overpriced rubbish available. Disappointed in Apple to get the hardware so right but the software so poor ? and this is from me, an Apple fan of 20+ years (yes, I did use to sell Lisa computers as a Saturday job!) For the first time in my Apple user experience I feel cheated!. 

$$;
Pros:. The interface, Easy of Use and Idea of buying only what you want is a total plus. The video quality and speed of downloading is quite good.. 
Cons:. The availability of quality up-to-date content is horrible. No CBS, no good recent movies, old movie selection is horrible. 1080i? That's it?. 
Summary:. I wanted to drop cable all together and I thought Apple TV combined with Netfilx and Sony PS3 was going to be my solution out of the handcuffs of cable tv service. After purchasing an Apple TV and figuring out that you can't watch CBS on it means that it's not a viable solution yet. The options that are available to Apple TV users is horrible. The movie selections are pretty bad also.. In my opinion it's not worth it to buy an Apple TV if you already have a PS3 and Cable TV DVR. They do not provide a option to what is already out there.. I'm actually thinking about returning it since it serves no purpose to my current media setup.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to operate once working properly, small.. 
Cons:. The sync function with my MacBook Pro. (Main reason for purchase). 
Summary:. 5 Hours... 2 very long calls into Apple Care and it is finally recognizing my iTunes library on my MacBook Pro. Oh, the excitement begins... so I turn on Avatar. about 7 minutes in I have to pause the movie and take care of some laundry. I come back 10 minutes later and it appears to be froze. It won't play or function what-so-ever. I had to literally pull the plug to restart it. After it boots back up it no longer can find my iTunes Library. By now Apple Care is closed. I have an appointment scheduled for them to contact me tomorrow. I am not entirely convinced that I am going to be keeping this. This is a fail on Apples part.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ability to use Netflix and option to rent TV shows. Cheaper.. 
Cons:. Can't purchase TV shows - no hard drive is fine, but cannot attach one and can't save it in the cloud.. 
Summary:. I own the older Apple TV which in my opinion is a better device - no-one should argue with me on that point especially when it comes to the hardware (the smaller size of the new one will not be a big deal). Its essentially a cheaper device without a hard drive but gives you the ability to tap into netflix and rent TV shows - thats just software - which the old Apple TV will not be allowed to have in any future updates apparently.. While I like the idea of renting movies (where the cost of buying is 3x the cost of renting - you typically only need to watch a movie once). I am not sure if I am into renting a TV show which is half the price of buying - in fact if you buy a season of say How I met your mother - it would end up costing less than $1.30 per episode - and chances are you may want to watch the same episode more than once.. So in other words, you have given me something I don't want and taken away something I do want. If I want to buy TV shows, i have to buy it on my mac and stream it to the apple tv - which is kind of back to square one again.. To be honest, I understand why it continues to be a hobby. The reason is simple: Apple cannot make it anything more than that unless they negotiate better terms with content providers who are paranoid about cannibalizing their existing revenue streams with networks and DVD sales.. As a device I think the original Apple TV is perfect actually - the key limitation was content availability, content pricing, and storage. Storage is not about the gigabites it came with, but why I need to store anything locally at all. If I was allowed to purchase the content on my account and have it streamed to me whenever I wanted to, then thats a great deal. But I would need to have ALL content available at prices that are lower than the cost of DVDs for movies (essentially you are cutting all the middle men), and be able to purchase all TV shows as they air on the local networks - OR give me the option to subscription deals for some content etc.. Its a case of chicken and the egg - you can't have a golden egg unless the chicken of the entertainment industry (Studios) is willing to lay that egg and embrace this new age of digital content.. I just wish that the USB port on the old apple TV had some use. I would love to attach a hard drive to it so I don't have to worry about managing storage - I don't want my mac to have all of this content on its hard drive - I am maxed out as it is.. 

$$;
Pros:. Yes it probably is a great "gizmo".. especially if you are getting for nothing.....but does it add anything to the experience? Does it do anything as well or better than what is available? This is just all appearance and no substance....... 
Cons:. your own prognosis it lacks features it should have. Why is the rating so high?Because it lacks the applications it should have and already we are waiting for the up-date to make it work the equivalent of other web TVs.. what a crock...... 

$$;
Pros:. size, made by apple. 
Cons:. only offers an hdmi out but no 1080p and needs more internet content.. 
Summary:. Still cant find any good reason to buy this and I am an apple fan. I will probably look at the ROKU box or the BOXEE box.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Netflix and TV show renting. 
Cons:. No local storage, requires your computer to be on for use.. 
Summary:. I need local storage to use an apple TV. I hate the new design and features and so do many of the users I talked with..
