my partner and i stayed at the lodge for one night recently , out of an original booking of 3 nights .
chris and colin are lovely , very relaxed and take life in their stride which is really refreshing and typically kiwi from our experience over the past 3 weeks .
we were upgraded to the fyffe suite from the aston suite which was a lovely gesture .
chris also actioned my request to have a bottle of wine and some flowers awaiting us for my partners 40th birthday .
she arranged this perfectly which was great .
the property is very pretty and characterful with large open spaces in the dining and sitting areas .
the breakfast that was served was a basic spread , but tasty .
on the downside for us personally , the property suffers from too much road noise , but we are used to living in a more rural environment .
if you are from the city , you may not be so bothered by road noise , but it was far too loud for us and thus we checked out after first night , which chris was very understanding of .
another issue , after the road noise , is the price .
whilst the fyffe suite is fantastic and spacious , at nzd 600+ for that room ( although we paid nzd 465 in line with aston suite ) it is around nzd 200 per night too expensive looking at other local accommodation , when quality of finish , decor etc are taking into consideration .

this is a beautiful lodge and if location and road noise are not key drivers for you , chris and colin will look after you.
