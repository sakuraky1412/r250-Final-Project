Pros:. This is the best camcorder in its class. Cheap media 60min tapes ($2) and awesome performance! You will be amazed at your videos!. 
Cons:. Battery life is short. Get an extra 1500mah battery.... 
Summary:. Great product very satisfied!.

Pros:. superb image quality. 
Cons:. none at all. 
Summary:. stunning image quality. life-like pictures. just the best. can't go wrong.. 

$$;
Pros:. extremely sharp video with natural color; HDMI; hot shoe;. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. I got the Canon DM-50 external mic and it performs very well. The "shutgun" mode really zoom in on the subject of shooting.. The image is like HD Broadcast, fantastic. I don't agree with CNET review that low light performance is lacking. I think they meant in "no light" situation, cause I tested mine and it work great for me indoor with dim light.. Price is right comparing to SONY's counterparts.. Highly recommended!. 

$$;
Pros:. Stunning 1080p video. 
Cons:. I have no issues with this camera. 
Summary:. This is my first DIGITAL video camera and was very impressed with the HD images on a 46" HDTV connected via HDMI cable. The picture was sharper and more brilliant than anything I had ever seen. It exceeded my expectations! I was also please with the no hassle connection to my Mac G5 and the incredible video using iMovie and iDVD.. I took it on a trip to Greece and used a tripod to gather images. The cost of the camcorder and carting around the tripod was well worth it because of the spectacular video I brought home. Thanks Canon!. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome video, Great Low-light in 24P, nice color rendition, 24P. 
Cons:. Build quality feels a tad cheap.. 
Summary:. I have had several camcorders in my life. They were the Canon GL-1, the Panasonic PV-GS150 and the PV-GS250. My GL-1 was amazing but it was big and I sold it when I got married. The Panasonic's were nice but they always left me wanting. Poor low-light and average feature-set.. To date this is my favorite camcorder. The video quality is amazing. The camcorder is so easy to use. I love that I don't have to spend gobs of time fiddling with presets to get good video.. About 24P. It's really cool. It makes low-light footage look awesome. I would say, however, that when it comes to shooting impromptu family videos, I prefer the "videoish" look of 1080i. Their are two reasons for this: 1. I discovered that I want my family videos to look like video. Back when I was making short movies, 24P was the perfect solution to making video look slightly more like film. I do not desire the same effect with baby videos. Of course when I'm shooting in low-light, I check this opinion at the door and go for the 24P. It really produces nice color under harsh conditions. The second reason is that while 24P is very pretty, it has a more 2 dimensional look than 1080i. I think this is because you have more information in 60 half-frames vs. 24 full frames. If I were making a short movie, I would not hesitate to shoot 24P though.. I can't say enough about this camcorder. Okay so the build quality is chintzy. After most people see the quality of the video it shoots, I'm sure they can learn to live with it. I know I did. It doesn't even bother me enough to knock it down to a 9. For once, Canon really got it right.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just about anything I need is built in.. 
Cons:. Relatively fragile construction. 
Summary:. I purchased this camera for my cine projects, and making presentation DVDs for my software products, hoping to be able to generate broadcast quality without having to carry a bulky XL-2(which has not HD).(there is a big difference to go up in a volcano carrying 10 pounds less). Appart from the "house consumer" look that ashames pro people, the HV20 has just about everything, and every single feature works great. I have heard complains about noise in low light, but as photographer I intend to light my subjects in a way I like. No light, no image! I use manual exposure and manual focus. Noise in low light is the result of amplification, but in manual mode, you command the camera, and hence no noise will be visible as I've confirmed.. I took casual video (AutoFocus, AutoExposure) of Las Vegas at night and it is superb, from image stabilization to incredible color and sharpness. And that super-detail 1080 HD is just what I needed. For pro work, just added a good shielded mic, a good hold/stand or steadycam, and sunshade/filter adaptor. In my HD tv set it shines like no one I ever had. As for cinema mode and 24P, it is just what I expected. With a tiny bit of grain in post process, it shines like pure film (because for making even a short movie, you DO need post process). The small light in the front is a toy, but just ignore it, and use studio lights or existing light.. What else can I say? I love it. A feature I could wish: smooth slow motion without post.. 

$$;
Pros:. Affordable, Excellent Video, HDMI output, improved battery, light weight. 
Cons:. Canon decided to go with Mini SD instead SD card, Why? Low Light performance was ok, but not great.. 
Summary:. I purchased this Camcorder yesterday at place I work for 830 dollars. Yes, that's right. I have an employee discount. I could have purchased the Sony HC7, but the problem is... that camcorder still costs more than 1000 dollars with my employee discount. I am really happy with my choice. This camcorder takes great videos, and performace was very solid. I realy like the overall design of this camcorder. It's light weight, and compact. Thx you canon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredible picture quality and sound pickup. 
Cons:. Do I really have to give one?. 
Summary:. First off, let me say that I am super happy with this camera. It has exceeded my expectations.. Though you do get graininess at lower light, Im telling you, the noise level has been well dealt with. They made the noise much smaller so it's less intrusive and really I think you'll be surprised at the high quality in low light.. The camera light is just a small (very small) light but honestly in a really dark setting it does the job. It wont light up a whole room but it really focuses the light in a small area, illuminating objects or people close by.. The picture is just sweet! I LOVE the clarity of the colors and edges. It's truly an HD quality picture.. The thing you dont hear much about that Im so excited about is the sound. NO NEED for an extra zoom mic or anything. This thing picks up INCREDIBLE quality sound. When I hold the camera, I noticed I can hear myself breathing on playback (Im very serious).. I filmed my dog in the yard and his clanging of his collar was so crystal clear, you'd take a second to realize it was on the video and not something else. This thing sounds incredible!. I just want to say that I'm so happy I bought this camera and just didnt expect it to be as nicely functionable as it is.. Thanks Canon!.

Pros:. F�cil de manejar, las opciones que el producto ofrece, como ser HD (alta definici�n), control remoto, opciones de filiaci�n/grabaci�n, son de alta categor�a.. 
Cons:. La grabaci�n el la obscuridad es un poquito mala. La c�mara en si, parece un poquito baratushca (de medio pelo, ensamblada a la r�pida con materiales baratos). Pero esto no parece afectar la calidad de la grabaci�n.. 
Summary:. Por el precio, y por lo que uno obtiene de este producto. Una de las mejores compras (Value) que uno puede hacer. Especialmente teniendo en cuenta que otras c�maras HD (alta definici�n) usan una tecnolog�a de memoria FLASH. Y como toda nueva tecnolog�a, pues estas c�maras son caras, y una mala inversi�n, ya que todos sabemos que a los pocos meses, el precio de estas c�maras caer�. Si buscas VALUE, esta es la c�mara que har� feliz.. La c�mara usa cassettes HD, que no son muy caros, especialmente si uno los compra en el Internet ebay.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, manual options. 
Cons:. No real wide angle, poor microphone. 
Summary:. Add the optional winde-angle converter WD-H43 and the external michophone DM-50 and the camera becomes a semi-pro camera, with possibility to adjust exposure AND soundlevel, and monitoring sound.. 

$$;
Pros:. HDV on Mini DV tape, combo of 24P with Cine Mode looks great in full light, excellent menu system, good manual controls. 
Cons:. Rediculously awful zoom lever, could have better low light, why not plain SD instead of mini SD?. 
Summary:. The Canon HV20 is in my opinion the best sub $1000 camcorder on the market. It records in the most convenient HD format (HDV) on the most developed media type (mini DV).. Colors are very accurate for a camcorder in this range. The Cine Mode offers more subdued colors for a more professional look.. This camcorder has a great menu system, it is intuitive and allows you to fairly quickly access the suite of manual controls.. Speaking of which, they're great!. The price just keeps dropping for this cam, and as it does it becomes one of the best bargains around. I highly recommend this camcorder. Great job Canon!. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredible picture. 
Cons:. lack of manual controls or difficulty enabling manual control. 
Summary:. The footage you can take with this little camera will blow people away. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, beautiful quality, great cam for price, tough (drop proof), tapes are cool, battery decent. 
Cons:. Sound not great, not good in low light, heads getting touchy lately. 
Summary:. I researched cameras extensively before buying this, since I make a video everyday for YouTube and needed something small (so I can hide it), easy, and with quality that can also work on television. I also wanted something close to $1000.. I like that ths HV20 uses tape, as I'm not convinced DVD burners are "there yet," and I don't like digital storage because I need to run into a drugstore sometimes and get more footage (no time or means to transfer).. I'm very happy with this camera, and I'm back on the market again (and thinking of buying a second) only because the recording head is having problems and I know I need a backup. Now I'll test how Canon handles warantee issues (it's still covered). I've dropped it a few times and it's kept rolling. Lately I have some digital glitches on the left of the screen that don't seem to go away with head cleaning.. -Nalts, willvideoforfood.com.

Pros:. Splendid HD pictures on my TV. Could not ask for better.. 
Cons:. Hard to take still pictures with fingers in strap.. 
Summary:. One of the greatest features is the ability to pause viewing video, and being able to take stills of the scene you are watching. Two weeks ago I was in 3 National Parks and was taking Video and stills. I missed some stills, but got them later while viewing the Video.. The Video could not be any better. I have a 61" Samsung DLP and after hooking up the HDMI cable I was watching fantastic Movies.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great colors. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. Best consumer grade video I have ever taken; unbelievable for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Instant autofocus, optical image stabilization, and picture quality - video and stills even in what I consider low light conditions. 
Cons:. I haven't yet figured out if the automatic backlight correction works. 
Summary:. I'm glad I waited for the HV20 to come out. I wanted an HD camcorder to record our two week trip to Alaska in July and finally passed on all the Sony models, the only other brand I considered, as I did not like the touchscreen. I'm also glad I didn't get the hard drive as the tapes allow unlimited recording time on an extended trip and are so simple and reliable. I received my HV20 in May and on the Alaska trip took seven hours of HD video on miniDVs and over 350 stills to the one gig mini SD card I purchased. I also purchased an additional battery but never had to use it to complete a 63 minute tape. I could not be happier. OUTSTANDING!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is superb. Lightweight and easy to carry.. 
Cons:. Camera-Off-Playback switch and zoom control are not well designed.. 
Summary:. I recently carried this camera -- including the wide angle supplemental lens -- all over Paris, Holland and London. Light and easy to handle even wiht the wide angle lens attached. The results were stunning! Performed will in all lighting conditions. Good battery life. I treated the Camera-Off-Playback switch with care. It seems flimsy when compared wiht my GL-1. Likewise, the zoom control is not very well designed. Awkward location and too small sized for easy, quick use. I was very please with the stills as well. All in all an excellent camera for the traveler.. 

$$;
Pros:. 24P HDV Recording, outstanding picture quality when using both outdoors and indoors. 
Cons:. It doesn't feel like a $1000 camera and the zoom button isn't ideal. 
Summary:. I purchased this camera to analyze my golf swing. It has worked out perfectly. I used the 24P HD mode with the preset "sport" setting to record my swing. I then replayed it on my HD TV. I was able to view my swing frame by frame and the video quality is amazing. The 1/2000 max shutter speed appears to be adequate for recording a golf swing and being able to view the exact positions of the golf head throughout the swing. I could also see the balls in flight which helps with the analysis. I also plan to record a cooking show with my wife for family and friends. I shot a short segment in our kitchen and was amazed at the quality of the picture with no additional lighting. Overall, I'm very pleased with the HV20. I have yet to load video into my PC so I can't comment on the ease of video editing. I plan to use V1 software downloaded for free from the David Leadbetter website to do detailed analysis of my golf swing.. 

$$;
Pros:. High Quality Optics for a low price. 
Cons:. Poorly designed, cheap quality frame. 
Summary:. I have been doing allot of research on 2 camcorders. The Canon HV20 and the Sony HC7 and that is why I am so suprised that Cnet dropped the ball on this one. Now before you say anything let me give you two points of reference.. These guys know there business.. http://www.camcorderinfo.com/. Independant testing/comparison of both Camcorders. Sadly in German, however you can download the video samples taken from both cameras.. http://www.fxsupport.de/21.html#. My own personal testing and research has came to the conclusion that the Canon HV20 and the Sony HC7 have very little differance in Full Light shots. However when you take both cameras into a Low light situation, the Canon stands out with a brighter and cleaner picture then the Sony HC7.If you dont believe me. See for yourself by going to. http://www.fxsupport.de/21.html#. and downloading the video samples from both cameras (especially the low light/ night footage) and judge for yourself. The videos are pretty large but if you have DSL or faster it should be no problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Spectacular quality video, improved form factor. 
Cons:. Not exceptionally well balanced during shooting. 
Summary:. Although I've only had it a few days, I feel this is the best mainstream consumer camera available today and the $1K price point beats competitors prices too without resorting to proprietary or emerging codec/formats. CNet rated this too low, not sure why. I researched to infinity and beyond, thrilled with this fast-focus Canon gem. 10x optical, 40x digital, 200x 'just because it can' zoom is superb. Using HD mini-DV tapes it retains the easy to transfer format but recommend you use an external drive (files are huge). Can convert other sources to DV, can take 3.1Mb images during or after recording video, nothing this cam can't do. Low light is fine to me, image stab works well especially considering palm size. It feels tipsy toward the display side but is much improved over the awkward vertical HV10 and Canon all tweaked all the previous weak spots too. Battery life has been 50 minutes filming child play so recommend a second battery and use only HDV cassettes (slightly more money but worth it, can use reg DV too). Sony camp offers pretty much one set of guts rebadged in gen 2 with three formats and DVD based vids are tricky to edit (some impossible today with TBD codecs). Panasonic is decent but Canon has achieved what the most recent generation of HDMI equipped users want: transparent HD 1080i quality and USB, Firewire, composite and HDMI output, without any additional hassle!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great video, compact size, ease of use. 
Cons:. Mic picks up camera noise occasionally. 
Summary:. This is my first High Definition camcorder, and I'm loving it. I am not a professional at all but this thing is easy to use. The picture that I get is fantastic, it blows away anything I've seen from other simalarly priced cameras. My friend who just bought a Mini-DVD camcorder was very upset when he saw the footage that he could have been getting for a few bucks more.. You can see some footage and pictures from my camera at http://www.canonhv20.com. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, adjustable, pretty steady, true HD resolution, great package for price. 
Cons:. Limited configurability while recording; can't seem to find the right way to transfer it to my PC (prolly not camera's fault). 
Summary:. I wanted to have a camera that could zoom in and record things I couldn't see with my naked eye, and could see in the dark better than I normally could. The Canon HV20 scores really well on both points. The resolution is amazing - I piped it through my 40" 1080p LCD, and it is crystal clear - ugh - pores! Color saturation is better than I could have hoped for - red is red, green is green, outdoors look *unbelievable*. Low light (even pretty dim compact fluorescents) look good - there is a little graininess and loss of color the dimmer you get. When it is really dark, the camera will still pick up things I can no longer see, but the image will be grainy and a bit washed out, and movement will be blurry while the processor strains to resolve everything. Bear in mind that I was trying to test the camera's limits with progressively lower light. I really had no expectation that it would do anything with paltry light, given my (admittedly limited) experience with prior camcorders, and my expectations were exceeded on all fronts nevertheless.. OK - if you're viewing during normal conditions it looks gorgeous. Think National Geographic in full high def. Well, maybe not that because my back yard doesn't look like Bali, but it is awesome. The WOW factor is totally there.. Recommended? Heck, yeah! I would have expected something this nice to cost two or three times as much!. 

$$;
Pros:. HDV format is compatible with editing packages like Adobe Premier Pro, video image qualiy is outstanding, records HD to DV tape, beautiful 24P cinema mode, external audio jack allows for great audio. 
Cons:. Manual Focus is tricky, cannot set zoom stops for wide lens, need to purchase separate miniSD card for stills, no video input while shooting. 
Summary:. I chose the HV20 in preparation for a week long shoot in North and South India. I was ready to purchase the new Panasonic HVX200 (for approximately $5,000); but the $1,100 HV20 camera actually has some major advantages that convinced me it was a better choice for my project.. The biggest factor in my selection of the HV20 is editing capability. The HV20's HDV format is compatible with editing packages like Adobe Premier Pro, whereas the formats recorded (i.e. AVHCD or HD50) by other products from Panasonic and Sony are not very compatible with editing packages and may be impossible or require extra steps for post processing.. Regarding image quality, the camera earns a WOW! I think this camera is currently the very best option for a solo shoot on the go. CNet gets it right regarding image quality and color, in addition, shades of black go very deep.. External and hot shoe audio are also a big deal for high quality shooting. The LCD screen is sharp and the feature to impose a horizontal line or grid on the screen (but not recorded) is very handy to maintain level shots.. The camera is not tiny, but is small enough to be slipped into a very large trouser pocket; this allowed access to more spontaneous shooting opportunities than larger HD camera options. With a large fanny pack, I kept the camera (with extra tapes, batteries, monopod, and DM50 microphone) with me at all times and was ready for anything. For me, this portability factor transcends price point.. Regarding storage, the HV20 records HDV directly to DV tape. The much more expensive Panasonic HVX200 will record HD50 format (which is an equivalent or possibly superior format) but will only record SD (not HD) to tape; with the HXV200, proprietary P2 cards are required for HD recording (and an 8GB P2 card costs approximately $1,100). I bought this camera for the price of one 8GB P2 card!. Recording to tape seemed like a disadvantage at first, but the advantage in India was huge - I did not need to transfer anything to my PC or need a PC) until I was good and ready (so I could maximize shooting time on site and deal with all post production later); in addition, archival is handled up front with less compression and no spaces constraints - that more tapes could not solve; after shooting 10 tapes, I realized this is also a significant advantage. With less compression, tape may still actually be the superior recording media. I also took over 1,000 3.1 Megapixel still shots with the camera on a 2GB card.. The camera layout is also quite good. The tape and battery can be swapped out without removing from tripod or monopod mount. In unplanned situations, this was a major advantage.. A few ways the camera could be improved:. 1) the lens width varies when switching between video and still modes, so I expect that adding stills into my video will take extra editing time. 2) when using an after-market wide angle lens, a wide shot shows the black edges of the lens, it would help to have a settable zoom stop to control the zoom range on the wide side.. 3) the manual focus is not intuitive, more feedback on the dial or screen would help. 4) switching from auto to programmable mode would be better if some auto functions could be set to stay on. 5) an "auto backlight" feature would be handy. 6) the miniSD card was an inconvenient choice for still photo storage, since I could not reuse SD cards I already own (note that no memory card is included with the camera). 7) video input (like some Samsung products) would have helped so that I could keep the camera in my pocket and shoot with a lipstick cam when necessary (to avoid looking like the typical American tourist or for action/sports applications). 8) battery life was shorter than expected, I got 1 hour of recording from each battery.. Net net, this camera is fantastic and I believe the video quality is sufficent to qualify my project for a film festival submission.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tons of features to adjust just about everything!. 
Cons:. If you add a video light to the hot shoe, you then can't add the boom mic.. 
Summary:. This camcorder has just about everything you'd ever want! I had been reading reviews of all the latest and greatest camcorders but nothing had all the features I wanted. The Canon HV10 came pretty close till I realized they had no plug port for an external mic. So I canceled that off my want list. I also didn't want a hard drive format as when it got full and you are in the middle of a shoot, then what? Also I have allot of DV tapes so wanted to keep using those and it is so much easier to just pop in another one when one gets full. And they don't cost that much so easy to have extras around. Then comes the HV20 and yes, it has the miniDV, a mic jack, and a hot shoe! It has a pretty impressive photo mode of 3.1MP which isn't too shabby either for a camcorder. The small size and all the great features makes this the sure buy right now. I must confess I've only had mine for a few days and will be putting it to the full test this coming weekend where I'll be shooting video interviews at a convention. Then I'll know more. But with all the experimentation I've been doing, I'm very impressed with the complete control over shutter speeds, aperture, lighting condition options, and especially audio read-outs and control! You never see audio covered to this extent. I can watch the readout as I record! I have a hand held I can hook up, and I have the boom that goes in the hot shoe. So far I'm extremely impressed. With the cinema24 setting, and all the HDV settings I'm ready to rock and roll!. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb picture quality. Built in lens cap. Easy controls.. 
Cons:. Challenged auto focus in low light. 
Summary:. Wow. What a great camcorder! The picture quality is outstanding. All of the controls were easy to get used to, and the camera fits very nicely in the hand. A great camera for HD enthusiasts!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image quality, simple menu, wireless remote for playback, light weight. 
Cons:. Controls awkward for users with big hands, mini-SD instead of standard SD card, HUGE files when saving to the computer. 
Summary:. This is an excellent camcorder for the money. I first want to point out an inconsistency with CNET's review. They state you cannot change the white balance and thus need to turn the camera on/off in different lightning. This is INCORRECT. The camera WILL adjust in different lightning situations. I filmed my dad walking in the door as the sun was coming up, then shot my mom in the kitchen and the balances adjusted perfectly.. The video is a bit grainy while shooting in doors especially in low light. However shooting outdoors in the sun is spectacular. The colors are bright and vibrant and HD!. This camcorder works perfectly with my Intel Mac and the footage is excellent quality. If you plan on saving your raw footage on your computer you better invest in mass storage. About 20 minutes of my raw HD footage was 17.13 GB. Yes, you read that right, GIGABYTES. I've compressed most of my footage to distribute to family, but intend on saving the tapes since the file sizes are so big.. Overall I am very pleased with this camcorder. If you are an HD freak like me then this camera is well worth the $1100. I didn't give this camera a 10 simply because of the low-light performance. Other than that I'm extremely happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stunning Video, Manual Focus, great auto focus and image stabilization, HDMI out, many more good features. 
Cons:. haven't found any yet. 
Summary:. Buy this camera!. This camera produces near professional quality video at a price most of us can afford. Add in all of the "prosumer" features like manual focus, optical and electronic image stabilization, HDMI out, a mic input (mini), a headphone jack, an accessory shoe. This camera is loaded. I ordered mine as soon as it was available through B&#38;H Photo and have had it for a couple of days now. Right out of the box (after charging the battery) I recorded 3 minutes of video in my home under less than ideal lighting, plugged it directly into my JVC HDTV with my HDMI cable (not provided in the box) and watched stunning video. I'm an Army broadcaster and I've used lot s of professional equipment and I can say that this is the best video I've ever seen from a one chip camera period. Sony offers an HDV camera, but I chose to stick with Canon as I've come to notice that their products produce superior imagery, and I wasn't let down. I also have a 3 CCD Panasonic DV camera. I thought the image quality was good. It doesn't compare to HD. Going from SD mini DV to HD on mini dv is like going from VCD to DVD. I had no problem with Windows Vista. Once I loaded the software and drivers I plugged it in to my HP dv9230 and captured the HD into Windows MovieMaker with ease. Haven't tried it with Premiere Elements yet, but I'll assume it shouldn't be a problem. I would mention that if you plan on editing your video on your pc you may want to go with a higher end pc with a good video card. Your old Pentium 4 may not cut it. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was that I always leave room for improvement. With this camera there is not much to improve upon! Way to go Canon!. 

$$;
Pros:. Light, does HD, 24 P (like film) compact. 
Cons:. To Light, had to see view finder in bright light. 
Summary:. This is a great camera for current and some time to go...the only camera I would consider replacing this with would be the JVC HD 250 a $5,000 camera. We used this for our reviews at http://apinsights.info/Software_reviews.html. I would give it a 8.5 out of 10. A great buy below $750.00. Roger. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and color!. 
Cons:. A bit noisy because of the dv tape.. 
Summary:. I don't like that you can hear the tape when you go back and look/listen to your footage. But of course, all camcorders make some sort of noise I'm sure. If you have enough people talking or other sounds other than you, just standing there, it would be better.. Other than that little little problem, I'm loving it so far. Hasn't broken down yet and really, the picture is GREAT! I hooked it up to my HDTV and it looks excellent. This camcorder I think is the best "bang for the buck".. I also tried uploading the footage to my macbook pro. I was a bit hesitant to get this camera cause I didn't know if my computer was new enough to support HDV files. But it turned out ok. I uploaded it was a DV/Firewire cable that I had already. ( Don;t use their crappy cables, it'll take forever. I'm also planning on buying a HDMI cable, so it will be quick importing to iMovie HD.. All is well so far!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Controls and Video Quality. 
Cons:. Low light will not meet up with professional standards.. 
Summary:. Pros:. Relatively cheap. HD 1080i. Mini DV. Great colors. Mic in jack and headphone jack. 24P is overrated, but I'll put it in as a pro. Cons:. Low light is not good, but not terrible. omni-directional internal mic is poor. Buy an external mic for the cam and you will be happy with it- just make sure your subject is well-lit.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD and SD Recording, Tape Recording, Good Pictures. 
Cons:. Kinda heavy, no physical lens cap, tape compartment has tendency to be loose. 
Summary:. This is a great camera. My last one was a Panasonic GS59. It rocked and this one does too. It has 4 options for recording modes; HD, HD 24P, SD, and SD Wide, and Regular SD (BOX). This thing will require and dual or quad core processor to edit HD though so be mindful of this when buying.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast focus, great, auto WB, amazing picture. 
Cons:. too small in hand, low light just ok but good for 1 chip. 
Summary:. I continue to be amazed by this little cams picture quality. I has the best auto WB of any camera I've ever had. You cannot change the WB settings on the go but the auto is perfect 95% of the time. Auto focus is fast and accurate most of the time too. I'm used to manual 3-chip models and this cam is a little short on those but hey, it's a little consumer camcorder! The built-in light is fairly useless and the flip out screen is not as big as the Sony models 3.5". This unit does do what it's supposed to do...get great shots in auto mode from a little package.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent video HD quality. 
Cons:. Low light performance below average. 
Summary:. I love the HV20 for its clarity in HD. Picture looks great on my Samsung 40" 1080p LCD.. Would be good if we had:. 1. Better low light performance.. 2. Software to burn DVD HD format, with 1 button.. 3. To redesign the microphone to be less sensitive to the recorder's voice. The way to do that is to design a zoom directional microphone.. 4. Could expand the lens diameter out a bit more to get more light, boosting SNR a bit more for improved low light performance.. 5. Could improve on wide angle coverage. I have to use external wide angle lens for indoor filming.. However I am still very happy with the HV20, the best camera out there in its form factor at the price..

Pros:. Easy to use and 24 fps. Great Quality.. 
Cons:. The view finder is at a tight spot.. 
Summary:. Its better than sony hdr-ch7.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fine for what it is.. 
Cons:. Apparently does not actually output 24p. An know that the image is not 1920x1080 as you might expect from 'HD' but rather 1440x1080.. 
Summary:. I am a professional and was looking for a more covert HD camera that would not call attention to itself out in the field as being professional. I believe it is a clear choice over other HDVs in it's class.. But after perusing various forum postings by users of this camera trying to get the much coveted 24p out of it... you can't exactly. Very weird for a camera that shoots 24p. But from what users and Canon support are telling me, the camera insists on outputting the 24p image at 30fps with a 2:3 pulldown which introduces fields. So you must have software that will perform a 2:3 pullUP during capture or in post in order to get the image back to 24p. But I discovered a little problem with this if you are capturing from tape-. example jpeg (382kb). http://www.box.net/shared/static/15ydiu43co.jpg. When the 4:2:2 signal records to the tape it undergoes an MPEG 2 conversion/compression to 4:2:0 color space, which causes some loss of chroma data and consequent color bleed in the image that smears the fields a bit. So the fields can not be fully removed with any pullup process- with motion you see this telltale strobey/jaggy thing going on in the image. Am told that if you shoot directly to a hard drive capture while bypassing tape then you can avoid the problem. But that kind of undermines the normal purpose of a little spontaneous point-n-shoot palmcorder like the HV20 unless you are always hooked to a hard drive. If you dont care about 24p, or are using it in studio then it probably wont matter to you, and is a tremendous image quality for the price.. Also, the low-light capability is much better than what some users are commenting. You just have to use the right settings..

Pros:. Great HD, small, lightweight. 
Cons:. Poor build quality, audio is mediocre. 
Summary:. After years of using a Sony TVR900 for goofing around, I've switched up to HD with this little guy.. The build quality is shocking - for a thousand bucks I felt at first cheated by what is an extremely plasticky and flimsy body. The Sonys always feel solid and well put together. This feels like a cheap toy.. BUT - it's the picture that counts, and this little toy produces fantastic HD. I was really surprised by the colour depth. The HDMI output is the cherry - you can bump your flics straight into an HD plasma screen and enjoy the quality.. We wanted this for its portability, ease of use and its picture quality, and on all counts so far it has delivered.. Quibbles: the sound is rather cruddy. Despite a nice 24p feature, shutter and aperture cannot both be set manually simultaneously (meaning the camera is always adjusting one or the other - aaargh). And the screen is kind of small.. But nobody's perfect..

Pros:. Man. Focus, AV - DV conversion, Zoom Speeds, HDV. 
Cons:. Auto Gain, Poor Audio, poor low light performance. 
Summary:. This camera is a pure consumer camera though it can capture prosumer-like videos *some times*. Over all the performance is very satisfactory and it produces wonderful videos in good light conditions. Though the manual focus wheel is tiny and bit awkward to control, it does its job pretty well. The 3 preset zoom speeds are really nice which can produce professional looking zoom in/out. I find the analog to digital option very handy as many of the consumer cameras now-a-days do not have this feature. 1/2.7 CMOS with RGB filter and Canon DIGIC DV II internal algorithm are capable of reproducing vivid picture and real good colour. Another good thing with HV20 is that it has got many in / out options like DV/HDV, HDMI, AV/Head Phones, Component Out, Mic, USB etc. Manual audio gain control and mic attenuation are good to have in a consumer camera. It is also nice to see that the camera comes with functions like infinity focus, peeking &#38; zebra pattern to assist focus and exposure. The camera uses a more matured HDV technology compared to a relatively new AVCHD technology which is having hitches still  mainly in compatibility between manufactures.. For me, the most annoying thing with this little camera is gain it adds automatically based on the light condition. In low light it adds gain up to +27db which will produce a highly noisy / grainy video. There is no manual way to control this (unless you trick the camera) though there is one mode which does not add any gain and the result is too dark picture. Canon HV20s sound is very poor. The internal mic picks up motor hum and it is quite noticeable when recorded in quiet places. Cannon could have designed the view finder little more thoughtfully. If you are used to Sonys LANC or Panasonics wire remote, you will be disappointed as HV20 does not have anything of that sort.. In my opinion, one will not be disappointed with this camera if it is used basically for home videos or something like reasonably good quality podcast video recordings. (Believe me; people are doing serious stuff with this little toy!). If you have an entry level professional / prosumer camcorder in your mind, stay away from this. This camera is reasonably price when compared to the high-end MiniDV consumer cameras. Also the price looks attractive when compared to main competitors Sony HDR-HC7 and JVC Everio GZ 7. Another plus point (not from the manufacturers!) for Canon HV20 &#38; HV30 users is the HV20 forum with more than 10,500 members! (www.hv20.com).

Pros:. looks better than a mini-dv. 
Cons:. should I be overwhelmed for $1000?. 
Summary:. WARNING: The following comes from a video-layman, and camcorder novice. I've only used crappy mini-dv cameras for under $400 in the past. This is my first HD camera, and my first camera for over $400.. I got an HV20 from Ritz Camera on Friday in Portland, Oregon. I have 10 days to decide whether to keep it, or not. I liked their return policy better than Circuit City or Best Buy. Perhaps because of my inexperience and lack of an HDTV, I was a bit underwhelmed. The first shots I took were indoors at night with low lighting. The footage didn't look much different from regular consumer camcorders.. But the next day I did a test in a classroom with flourescent lighting. I filmed the same subject standing in the same location with my old mini-dv and the HV20, put the footage side by side on my powerbook (using iMovie) and the difference was obvious. The color and saturation was more vibrant, and the detail a bit clearer with the HV20.. But still, I thought... $1100 and it's only THAT much better?. AND - I was disappointed that the much-vaunted 24P mode didn't show me any difference in quality, either. And yes, you can't really move the camera around when it's in 24P mode: it will show ghost trails and stuttering effects.. I realize I probably need to playback footage on a HDTV to see the real difference.. Anyway, this being my first HD camera, some other things I learned: importing HD footage takes about 4 times as long. The computer (I use iMovie exclusively) imports at 1/4 to 1/2 of real-time. iMovie does state that for you ("Importing at 1/4 speed").. After a few hours of using it, I did notice the awkwardness of design and discomfort in my hand. But I don't think that's enough of a reason to return it.. I'm open to feedback.. Thanks. -Matt.

Pros:. Great Picture and Price. 
Cons:. Poor Build Quality - Hard to hold !. 
Summary:. This Camera was originally over $1000.00 which I think is way overpriced. At $677.00 that I paid it is better but still overpriced. The video is great if you turn all of the sharpening off in the Camera. But the build Quality is terrible. It feels like a cheap toy with loose battery, loose cover over tape compartment ( which you hold ) The Camera rattles when you roll it back and forth,( the Image stabilizaton ) which quits once the camera is put into camera mode.The Camera has an unnatural grip, it seems that I am pointing the camera in the right direction but I am actually shooting low, awkward, also the hand strap that is necessary to hold the camera is thin and cheap, not much support here. My Camera's DV port failed within a week, Butterfly Photo is sending another one. For the life of me I cannot understand why a different method of transferring video to the camera cannot be utilized - this DV thing is very problematic - I have 2 other cameras that have similar problems with the DV ( firewire ) port. If you do a search you will find it is a real problem. USB would work better - Just transfer it and edit it later - just a bulk transfer - I just wants something that works. Also if you look @ Consumer Reports Canon MiniDV repair record is the worst, Samsung 10% Canon Last @ 10% Sony is @ 4%. I will try this Camera 1 more time Only because I shot Christmas Videos in HD on it - My only other option is a Sony HD Camera, which is not as highly rated as this one and is still much more expensive, the only redeeming feature of the Sony is the build quality. Canon Support was great ! Sony could care less. But if your product is prone to failure you had better have good support..

Pros:. Easy control of functions / 5 non-propiertary outputs. 
Cons:. Average video picture during playback. Mic is too sensative in auto mode.. 
Summary:. I researched camcorders for several weeks. I wanted to replace my aging Panasonic DV-51 (2001 model). I was excited to see all the great reviews on the Canon HV20. However, none of the hype lived up to expectation.. Both outside massive light, and inside low light video was only a tad better than my 6 year old cheap Panasonic DV-51. However not a $1000 better. Playback was on a Sony KDF60XBR950. ( High Def 60 inch LCD projection). The 24p and cine modes were the most over hyped functions of the Canon HV20. The video shot in these modes did not live up to the hype. It is a nice feature. However, not worth a $1000. Also those interested in editing should search the difficulty in doing so with the 24p mode shot on the canon hv20. The mic is set to pick up any and all sounds including the whine of the camcorder motor. The high pitched sound was extremely annoying during playback. The mic gain can only be controlled in manual program mode. However after switching back to auto mode the extremely annoying whine is heard. Fortunately you can set most of the auto function modes to auto while in manual program mode.. I could not recommend this camcorder to anyone upgrading their current miniDV model. However, if you are in the market for your first camcorder or replacing an old VHS or Betacam than this is probably the best choice for $1000 range camcorder.. I am returning mine today and suck up the 15% restocking fee. Yes losing $150 is worth it to me to shed me of paying the full $1000. I knew better but trusted all the reviews to save me a restocking fee.. Only fools rush in. Next time I will go to Crutchfield or another dealer without restocking fees..

Pros:. Picture quality, handling. 
Cons:. Wideangle, no 24 h time format. 
Summary:. Have had the camera for one day only. Seems good regarding quality and handling. But has a really stupid and irritating error for those living outside of 12 h (AM/PM)time zones. There is no possibility to enter a 24 h format. For this type of quality camera it is an error which seems like a joke..

Pros:. Easy to use &#38; good picture quality. 
Cons:. Video capture is poor and rewind is very inaccurate. 
Summary:. I bought a Canon HV20 from Electronic Express to tape my baby girl who was on the way. I got the camera on time, took it to the hospital, recording was smooth I was really enjoying the camera and taking HD video of my new baby girl. I got home all excited to copy the video off the camera and send it to our friends or host it on our family website. To my surprise theres no software to copy a rough video off the camera. So I went looking around for some software, downloaded trial of Adobe Premier Elements 3.0 started the software up and began capturing through Firewire. Blue screened about 3 seconds into the video every time, I thought maybe it had to do with my system running Vista 64bit so I took my Firewire card out of my computer and went over to a friends house who was running Vista 32bit on a different set of hardware. We made it little further in capturing the video before we got blue screen on his computer roughly 5 min into the Video. Thinking this might have something to do with the Firewire card I went to Frys electronics and bought a different Firewire card (different brand Belkin). Using the new Firewire card I had better success, however I could only capture roughly 12 minutes of Video before it would blue screen my computer. Its a good thing Premier streams the captured bits to MPEG-2 to disk or I wouldnt have gotten my footage off my camera of my new born baby girl. Needless to say Im very disappointed in Canon for the lack of software and quality of Canon drivers. In all cases the blue screen indicated Canon driver fault which caused the blue screen. I contacted Canon support on the phone and the funny thing was they told me to try all the things I already had and then they said its new technology so its expected to have some issues. I would agree except I paid $1100 for this camera and all I wanted to do was capture the video off of it nothing fancy. Seems like a core issue if you cant get the video you recorded off the camera.. After all that I contacted Electronic Express and they agreed to take the Camera back however its going to cost me 10% ($110) for restocking fee, this is quite frustrating to be punished for buying this camera and having no way to make it work, getting new hardware isnt going to help a driver issue and Canon doesnt have any updated driver available. Since I have no use for a Camera I can't capture video from, so Im reluctantly sending it back and looking at some of the Sony HD video cameras which wasnt my first choice obviously..

Pros:. great color-easy to learn. 
Cons:. build quality-physical use-battery fit-low light. 
Summary:. I received HV20 on 4/10 and am quite dissapointed in the build quality and how awkward one hand use is. Major complaint is how sloppy the batteries,especially the extended Canon BP-2L14-(non counterfeit), fit on the camera. When moving the camera in different positions the battery is so loose I feel the battery slide around and bump the cam body. The only time it doesn't do it is if I keep the cam horizontial or put my thumb on the battery.I find this unacceptable for a $1100 peice of precision equip. The body is lightweight cheap plastic as are the covers,eyecup stationary with no eye cup. I would like to hear from the CNET reviewer and others on these issues,also if the battery sloppiness is an issue on their HV20's and from owners of the sony HC-5 and HC-7 to see if their batteies-especially the extened versions are tighter fitting and if the nightshot mode is as good as they say? I don't care about the greenish color. The HV20 is vey lacking in low light-shooting,especially outside at night. The night mode is useless unless on a tri-pod and not touched while recording. I have till 5/8 to return to Crutchfield's with NO RE-STOCKING FEES and I can't say enough good things about them and their help on the battery issue! Canon basically didn't care and said to buy a battery from them-with a $11+change for reg shipping fee, and if I wanted to send it back I would also pay return shipping! They use other cam model batteries to cut cost and ruined a promising product..

Pros:. Picture quality. 
Cons:. controls are small and badly designed, located. 
Summary:. I have a Canon HV20 camera which I purchased less than 8 months ago and at the moment, it is a piece of junk. Here I am in Antigua Guatamala to shoot video of the Easter celebration, one of the most exciting in Cantral America. I have spend many hundreds of dollars to get here, not to mention the $1200 for the camera, and on the morning of Palm Sunday, I try to turn on my almost new camera and it doesn't work.. My previous Panasonic camera worked flawlessly for four years before it was stolen. It even continued to work after I dropped it from a Ferris Wheel in India.. Obviously, the fact that the HV20 is unreliable should be enough to disuade anyone from buying one of this camera but I will point out sone other things.. First, admittedly the picture quality is wonderful, the best of any camera I have used, and I have been using video cameras for over 25 years.. On the other hand the controls are terrible, the worst on any camera I have ever used.. To begin with, Canon has decided to eliminate the projecting viewfinder. Because of this I find that everytime I start the shot, my finger bumps into my nose and I get a jump at the begining and end of every shot. (I am forced to view with my eft eye.). The zoom wheel is small and located in a spot where I always had to search around to find it again, often spoiling the shot. Hiow much better to have had a small bar near the shooting button which could be raised and lowerede by the thumb. Instead they choose to place the menu button there, a button that is hardly ever moved.. Thirdly, the on-off button is quite idfficult to manipulate and I suspect it is the cause of my camera's problem. It seems to be very badly designed and difficult to use, particularly for a westerner with large fingers.. I suspect that the camera makers never really tested the camera with actual users.. I recommend that you avoid buying this camera, at least till Canon makes some serious changes to bring the mechanical quality of this camera up the its picture quality..

Pros:. I can watch it on tv. 
Cons:. Can't capture video. 
Summary:. is it possible to actually capture something, anything with this camera? I can't successfully capture with HDVsplit which is what is recommended, I have tried Premiere and that won't work either..
