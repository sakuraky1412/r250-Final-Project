so much better than the wd my passport  .
it has no virtual cd so you can use it any way you like .
i bought this product a year ago  .
i am thrilled to have it for back ups and to put all my large projects , movies , and music on  .
it really is built to last  .
i think this is the best piece of equipment i have ever bought for my computer  .
bar    none  .
what a price  .
silent , doesn't over    heat  .
weighs less than my 1st gen iphone  .
would definitely recommend , as long as it does not crash or die      )  .
if you're on an serious budget and need an nice external drive for your mac , buy this  .
if you need or want extra memory , i highly recommend this drive  .
i still own the seagate freeagent go that i bought two years ago , so i've had a good experience with seagate products in the past  .
recently , i needed more memory for my music and video files , so i did not hesitate to buy the latest freeagent go model  .
the new design is gorgeous and small  .
the performance and speed is fantastic , and the software is very handy (though i rarely use it)  .
you can customize the drive to auto    play music or video , auto    load your picture    viewing software , or open windows explorer to view the files , etc  .
you cannot go wrong with this external hard drive  .
do not hesitate to email or post any questions .
if you're looking for an excellent portable drive to have your drive file backups on the go , this is it  .
the optional dock accessory is a nice touch as well one thing to note    the usb cord that came with my drive (500gb) is not short like the cnet reviewer pointed out  .
the cord that shipped with my drive is at least a foot long , if not longer  .
for a portable drive , i do not see why you'd want anything longer than that .
i like this product simply because it works , and it works well  .
the 5 year product coverage is also nice .
this is a great drive that is mac compatible (with disk utility reformat)  .
works with time machine and is fast enough for large video/audio transfers  .
best of all its very thin and light .
even though the software is not the best and the short usb can be aggravating at times i would still recommend this to everyone  .
i love my freeagent go and never leave home without it  .
i happened to have some extra room in my freeagent so decided to put some of my favorite portable apps including firefox portable , portable sudoku and a mobile media player (for the media on the drive)  .
so i really suggest giving this drive a try   ) happy researching  .
review the detailed capabilities of the software that allows you to control your data storage and control automaticbackup and built in security  .
street price for 160 gb model is 59 dollars  .
cnet evaluators only considered hw capability did not explain sw in their valulatio  .
poor job .
looks/form   9/10  .
perhaps the greatest reason to buy this particular hard drive  .
it's slim and small , barely bigger in any dimension compared to an iphone  .
it is nice for sg to keep the same curves that the original go had , while updating the style with apple's ideologies in mind  .
the dock just makes it look that much better  .
the lights are a nice sight , especially in the dark  .
they can be turned off performance   8/10  .
speed is on par with my buddy's 320gb wd passport and 250gb simpletech wedge thing  .
transports things fast enough for a 2  .
5in drive , but i've seen better  .
however , what sets this drive apart from the passport is how bloody silent it is , not a single peep from this drive the case is also stone cold after a few hours of transferring large files back and forth  .
while they may be a nice sight to look at , the activity lights are a bit hard to read  .
they go from dim to slightly brighter  .
the threshold between these two states of activity are too subtle to tell what's going on ; but no matter , not a deal breaker for me  .
it's ntfs , so format it mac owners , don't go buying that more expensive mac version (  is up with that , 30 dollars extra to format it in fat32  .
packaged software   4/10  .
honestly , you can make a nice simple looking interface just like the one that this drive comes with , but what good is it if it misses a bunch of files  .
even after updating the software , it still dropped files like it had butterfingers  .
if i hadn't checked the log , i probably would have lost about 500mb of songs and a few sensitive documents the next time i do a clean wipe of my computer  .
get another backup utility , this is rubbish optional accessories   7  .
5/10  .
i got my drive at costco , which meant it also came with the case and optional dock  .
nice deal imo  .
these accessories won't factor into my score  .
the dock makes the hd look awfully nice while the case is a nice and cushy (p)leather material  .
while the dock is just simply a usb2  .
0 a to b connector attached to an aluminum platform , i still like it and think it's a worthy accessory to own  .
the hd is not a finger magnet like the passport , but it can still scratch up  .
the case looks up to the task for protecting the drive  .
you do not need these accessories at all overall   8/10  .
great drive , seagate really delivered with this portable external  .
by far the sleekest looking drive outside of building your own enclosure of course  .
performance is above average when factoring in heat and sound  .
it would definitely make a good stocking stuffer  .
just make sure to replace that weak bundled software that comes with it  .
recommended .
dear experts ,  .
during the data copy , system (external hard disk) abruptly stopped  .
then i removed the hard disk and plug in then system (laptop) say unable to find the software for the usb device even though i had loaded the segate manage software , system unable to find the software for the segate please help me out and s there any way to recover my data from it .
i bought this external hard drive for a backup hard drive when i had computer troubles about 7 months ago  .
last week it wouldn't work  .
i plugged it in and it would not do anything but beep  .
i contacted seagate and they told me i should have backed it up  .
let me repeat  .
back up my back up hard drive  .
this seems like a vicious circle to me  .
so i contacted their sister company that does recovery and they want anywhere from $1000 to $3000 to recover it  .
i could have bought a backup computer for that kind of money  .
i am a college student and a composer and all of my scores and music were on that drive  .
so now because of some cheapskate company i am out all of my compositions and possibly my career as a composer  .
if you think you need something backed up just buy a new computer .
i would not recommend this drive if you want to actually use it as a portable drive  .
if you want to sit it on your desk and never move it it would be perfect  .
but , is not the point of an external hard drive to be able to take it places and take your data with you  .
it just does not stand up to that kind of use  .
i brought mine back after 2 days , because the casing is delaminating  .
i just felt that it is a poorly constructed device and not worth my 70 dollars .
do not buy this drive if you value your data  .
like playing russian roulette .
this drive is seldom used , never dropped and rarely moved , nevertheless after three months of use , the drive abruptly stopped worked  .
seagate could offer little assistance and had no explanation for this error  .
my product is still under warranty so they will replace the drive , however , i must pay for data recovery  .
seagate  .
s response ,  .
next time , backup your data  .
i have seen numerous accounts on the internet account detailing this type of crash , however , seagate will not acknowledge this problem  .
i cannot recommend this product note   seagate refers users to i365 for data recovery  .
expect to pay at least $1200 for this service  .
if your product is under warranty and you would like to make use of another licensed data recovery service , you must provide written proof that the drive case is opened for this purpose in order to receive a replacement product from seagate .
the drive used for nearly one month for regular use  .
the essential data is backed up onto this drive before formating my computer's hdd  .
suddenly one day after connecting it to the desktop it did not show under the explorer , however , the drive name as seagate freeagent is shown in usb connections  .
i have ten different softwares developed on it and suddenly i am in a fix  .
very unreliable usb external drive  .
i am wary of replacing the drive as i will forego the data and labour on developing the same and at the same time will not be compensated by seagate for the same  .
how to recover all the data of almost 100 gb  .
that will cost me a huge amount of money , and surely much much more than what the drive costs  .
one more interesting thing , the drive shows a size of 2  .
2 tb without any free space in seagate manager  .
i am really in a fix because the entire softwares were used in my organisation where i work  .
funny thing is that , if it is being used as a backup tell me do i need to procure another one for backing the data i had on this one and so on please someone tell me what went wrong with this drive and is there any means to recover it  .
i loved this product until a few days ago  .
the drive died and when i contacted seagate i figured out why they can sell them so cheaply  .
they make up their money in support  .
i first tried to reach them through their preferred method , live chat with technical support on their site  .
after waiting 30 minutes for a response (during business hours) i disconnected and called them i explained to the woman on the phone what had happened and she asked if i'd like to try to see if someone in technical support could help retrieve my data  .
i said , yes  .
she then explained that the cost would be $15 to speak to technical support  .
i told her no thank you  .
just replace my drive  .
she then gives me the option of returning the drive using my own packing materials and waiting 2    4 weeks for a new drive or spending $19  .
95 to have them ship me a new drive first and use their materials to return it i'm seeing my story repeated on reviews all over the net and i do not want another seagate drive  .
can someone tell me who makes a reliable portable drive  .
product stopped working after less than 2 months  .
limited warranty does not cover them helping me get my data back off it and if i try to have someone recover the data , my warranty is completely void  .
piece of crap product .
worked fine for 3 months , used it for music storage used maybe a dozen times putting new music on it or using to put new songs on mp3 player  .
all of a sudden started getting messages that it is not working , not being recognized by the pc  .
sometimes not recognized at all , then would see it as an e drive , but no folders , then other times could see folders but no files within i researched seagate's website for hours they need to have a website just for this product/issue  .
i finally had enough and opened a 'ticket' with their support group  .
i asked one single , simple question i had seen so many posts for same issue , but several different solutions i asked if use of a y cable could very well solve the problem i got an email giving me links to the same self tshooting website and of course , i365 link in case i wanted to spend upto $4500/day for them to recover my files seems the desire to offer a good product to the market place is not the intent here , but rather the creation of a whle new profit center within seagate , i365 data recovery no i would not recommend this product and no it is not dropped and no it is never opened .
i cannot reccomend this product to anyone  .
i bought it at the university bookstore and believed the packaging that it is a quality product planned obsolecense  .
this is blantant disreguard for customer satasfaction that is suprising even for a hardware company  .
do not purchase anything from seagate  .
this product sucks and i droped it while i is sitting and it never worked again and the warranty is do not really work .
i shall not buy a seagate again .
after 3 months of use , the hd unexpectedly crashed/died , and now i'm left with a $100 paperweight , and seagate won't even acknowledge there is a problem (even though this is far from an isolated incident    there are endless forum posts with people with the same exact problem)  .
seagate won't replace it since the case is opened , and they wo not pay for data recovery (though , they will provide it for a $500    3000 fee) bottom line , this product is great until it crashed  .
but the fact is , it did crash , and i'm not the only one to have this problem , and seagate is unwilling to admit that there is something defective with this product  .
you're better off spending your money on a more reliable product , and losing out on the design and aesthetic advantages .
it is great , until it fell from the desk  .
the drives are simply to delicate to be used as a portable device  .
the housing in minimized to make the product smaller but it is not enough to protect it from damage  .
using them as portable almost insures they will be vulnerable to some bumps and bruises  .
do not rely on this product as a backup  .
one small drop and they die  .
mine lasted 2 weeks .
i am very very dissatisfied with this product  .
i bought this product less than a year ago to use as extra storage  .
so i stored data on their that i did not store anywhere else  .
i tried all the troubleshooting methods and none of them worked  .
i talked to a seagate agent about the issue and they took forever to respond  .
all in all , they forwarded me to the data recovery website where i contacted another agent  .
the base cost of data recovery is $399 and can go up to as much as $2500  .
i think it's ridiculous to even charge that much  .
i'm very upset about how unreliable this product is  .
i do not recommend it at all .
if you are going to get one you better go ahead and get 5  .
so that you can back up the backup the backup etc .
it suddenly died in just 7 months without any reason at all  .
it is never dropped nor exposed t any heat and humidity  .
i can no longer trust this product and therefore wouldn't recommend at all  .
it's cheaper compared to others however i do not think it would be practical if it fails sooner than expected .
i've had a seagate free agent pro for about a year and have experienced complete meltdown for the second time now  .
i woke this morning to the computer telling me it could not read the external hard drive and would like to know if i want to initialize it  .
the last time this happened , the rep asked me if i shook the hard drive  .
what  .
why would i shake the thing  .
better yet , why do they this sell crap on the shelves that potentially will destroy all your data  .
the guy said there is a possibility that the data can be recovered at my cost  .
why should i have to pay for the poor performance of this crappy device  .
i realize , again , that i should not rely on an external hard drive for storage , but i will never buy a seagate again  .
this is ridiculous  .
stop selling us crap seagate  .
i bought two drives  .
stored office data , software downloads etc on one (critical) , and music and videos on the other the one with the music and videos has stopped working within a month of purchase  .
do not know the trigger / cause  .
just stopped working one day seems like a power failure as the drive light keeps flashing on and off  .
lost all data  .
also lost trust in the product  .
have backed the other drive up onto a wd drive  .
unlikely to use it again  .
lost all data  .
also lost trust in the product  .
have backed the other drive up onto a wd drive  .
unlikely to buy seagate products in the future .
a waste of money i'm glad we can return it .
the street price is much more competitive than full retail shows.supplied sw is worth the price when competitors have none.; look at file system
Quiet; slim; excellent price, given the storage capacity of the drive.; This drive crashed after only three months of minimal use.
Surprisingly fast through USB2. Very small and light. Universal good looks.; Stainless steel finish scratched out of box. No Firewire 800 unless you buy "Mac Compatible" version.
Cheap price, big storage. NOT WORTH IT.; You will lose ALL of your files. The Customer Service will say TOO BAD. They will not help you at all. They will also deny this happens.
- The one big con outweighs anything else.. - The warranty; - Failed unpredictably and suddenly. Seems to be a known and common problem.
Its sleek and easy to use during mobility.; Sofware maintenance and the solution for it
It's small, it's cheap and the fact that it looks pretty attractive is not bad either.; -short usb cord
Relatively good $/gb ratio, doesn't require an AC adapter, fast, and great design and form factor; When is Seagate going to make a 1+ TB freeagent go?! Otherwise, NO cons!!
Great form factor; It died in 6 months. I was sent a "repaired/reconditioned" unit as my warranty replacement. That's just unsatisfactory.
It was great while it lasted.; I expect my hardware to last longer. Poor value for such a short duration.
Slim/sleek design, good transfer speeds, and non problems for the first 3 months of use.; Short USB cord, HD died after 3 months of use
PC version works on Mac with reformatting of drive. Cheaper than the Mac version and still works great! Goes well with Apple's Aluminum Keyboard.; Reformatting needed, default format can not be used by Macs.
Simple to use backup software. Small and very convenient to carry.; The unit died after 6 months. Seagate's support is abysmal.
Slim and easy to carry. Nice colour. Never had a problem with it.. Easy to entirely reformat if you want another file system.; I wish there was a 1T version.
slim. that's about it.; the external completely died on me out of no where after about 7 months. seagate's warranty doesn't cover data recovery and they start their cost at $399!!
It was great, until it fell from the desk.; The drives are simply to delicate to be used as a portable device.
The one thing that I liked was that it did hold data.; What i didn't like is that it shuts off every 5 seconds and then quits working completely after about 5 months.
great design and compatibility with my mac; it suddenly failed after 7 months. luckily, i was able to recover my files however i can no longer trust this product.
I have a terabite drive... worked well for 3 or 4 months.; Now the drive has developed a clicking noise, and wont run files smoothly. I bought it to back up files while overseas, now that I have taken it outside the US, I cannot get the warrenty fulfilled.
I bought the 500GB PC version for under $100 on sale at Best Buy. Plugged it into my 250GB MacBook Pro and Time Machine immediately and automatically reformatted the drive and did a complete backup in under 10 min. So far, fantastic product.; People have complained about the short USB cord. This is a backup drive for me, so I don't care about this.
Fast speeds. Very low price. Only 69.00 at Wal-Mart for the 250gb version.; The unit just felt too delicate for me. The casing is so thin, that I felt that I had to baby it too much. It's definitely not durable enough to serve as an everyday drive that you can bring with you.
+Slim form factor. +Decent transfer rates for a 5400 RPM USB2 drive. +Cheap storage. +Optional dock really adds to the looks and help clear the desk of wires. +Completely silent and heat free.; -Activity lights are useless, however pretty they may be.. -Crappy software that came with the drive backed up about 3/4ths of the songs and documents that I have.. -Crappy software also only backs up My Documents on Windows machines.
Very Sleek Design and available in many colors (though some colors can only be gotten with certain sizes...why I don't know but it is the way it is). It also has a great price per gigabyte.; The software in my opinion is very bad. If your folders are configured in a certain way it will not allow you to sync them. Also the USB cord is VERY SHORT (1ft. 5 5/8 in. long...This sound long but trust me, it can be very inconvenient)
This drive is small! I have an older Seagate portable drive , and this one is literally half as thick. The size/weight of my older drive was the main reason I didn't travel with it, but this one is going in my bag.; The drive is still a 5400-rpm drive, as most if not all of the portable USB drives are. Would like to see them come out with 7200-rpm drives as well.
My son is 2 and he loves electronics, he has plugged it into every socket you could imagine. The worst part he used it as a bath toy, It was not discovered for 30 minutes in the tub w/him. I let it dry out and it worked perfect after about 2 days!; I really don't have any Con's about this product. More problems with my Toshiba Laptop then the seagate hard drive.
