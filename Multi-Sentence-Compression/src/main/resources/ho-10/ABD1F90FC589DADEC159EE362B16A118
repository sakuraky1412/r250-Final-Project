the executive lounge is on the 15th floor and does breakfast with hot scrambled eggs , bacon , cold meat and cheese , fruits , pastries and cereal with a coffee machine .
turns out they had decided to clean the windows with a machine at night â€¦ it happened again the following night and woke us again .
we had a 5 night stay in a executive room with lounge access and view of the ocean .
10 rise tickets are 10,30 euro each from a machine at the entrance that takes euro cash and most cards but not amex .
there are 4 computers in the lobby with free internet access and printer connected for boarding passes and printing maps with directions and online reserved tickets .
there is a large pool , sauna and there wellness facility on the 2nd floor .
the hotel is close to many corporate headquarters including sanofi , the museum blau ( new natural history museum ) and the beach .
the staff at the front counter were more than helpful in terms of directions , routing advice and restaurant reservations .
the diagonal mar shopping center has about 50 franchise chain restaurants and a couple of reasonable tapas/tipica options as well as many shops .
minuses : its not in town ( +/- ) and generally this will be quieter than in central barcelona/el raval - so we thought until we were awoken but mechanical noise in at around 3am on our second last night .
