booked here primarily because we had a late flight out and ibis offered an internet deal with 4 pm checkout .
with that , we also got a cool little handyphone in the room with free calling and mobile data ( though it must be said the phone did n't hold a charge terrifically well , and of course would n't charge when we were out of the room ) as well as fast wifi for our own devices .
after weeks of the rest of southeast asia we were pretty happy to see the mirror sticker , `` you can drink this tap water '' and it was even kinder of ibis to offer a refillable water bottle for our day wanderings .
appreciated the mini-fridge , kettle and tea/coffee makings in the room and thick towels .
not a bad amount of room space for singapore , a bit pricey for the size but , well , that 's singapore .
the location exceeded expectations , one of the more pedestrian-friendly areas of downtown , near the design centre , bras basah mall with quirky bookstores , raffles , a toy museum , good hawker centres . . .
not far at all from both arab street and little india .
very helpful front desk staff .
fairly priced and tasty snacks in the restaurant , but we decided $ 21 was a bit much for breakfast so ca n't tell you about that .
too short a stay , and too hot a day , to take advantage of the free bicycles and the california fitness visit that would also have been included in . . .

quiet night 's sleep on a very comfortable big bed .
definitely recommend for either business or leisure travel.
