i 've not stayed in california enough to know if all the hotels are mandated to have the energy saving feature of automatic shut-off lights .
it 's cool to have the light turn on when you walk into a room - until it does n't work , that is .
the bathroom light was very dim when it was on , and totally dark when it would n't come on .
i mentioned the prob to the desk one morning and that evening when i came back it was still dim but would at least come on when i entered the bathroom .
and the lighting was really getting on my nerves for the lights to turn off on me while i am standing there going thru my luggage or talking on the phone .
kind of ridiculous , really .
i have a suspicion that it is an energy savings thing that is mandated by the state of california and not necessarily something the hotel decided to do on their own .
i do know that the aggravation of the lights constantly turning off at the wrong time will stick with me for a looooong time .
i did n't see a way to bypass the feature , either .
something like this would cause me to go elsewhere if it is just something s8 decided to do .
next year when it is time to go to quartzsite for the gem shows , i will be looking into this issue and will probably opt to stay somewhere . . .

aggravating !
