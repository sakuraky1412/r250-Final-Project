i will always love this cellphone , i will never replace this cellphone .

buy it , it is the best android phone in t mobile line up  .

it does not have any of the first cliqs issues , and its is thin and dependable .

it is time for an upgrade from t    mobile and the cliq xt had just come out  .

i never owned a smartphone and is anxious to see what all the hubbub is about  .

i is pleasantly surprised  .

it took a couple of days of exploring everything this amazing little thing could do , but once i figured out the apps market , android , and everything else that can be packed into the phone , i is pleased with my choice  .

the virtual keyboard is great once you master swype , which is the envy of my iphone friends  .

once you get the hang of it , you will find it amazingly accurate , and so much faster than poking around the traditional qwerty keyboard  .

i like the feel of this phone in my hand  .

it is solidly built , slim , with curves in the right places  .

the screen is bright , sharp , and vivid the only negatives i've found are that the voice command function has a hard time figuring out what i've said (my previous phones never had this problem , and it's not new technology) , and the virtual phone keypad is rather sensitive , resulting in the occasional wrong number being dialed  .

these are relatively minor problems that take some getting used to as a newby to the world of apps , smartphones , social networking , etc  .

, i have found this phone to be very usable , useful , well    designed , and fun  .

when one of my iphone friends shows me one of their cool apps , i search the android market and find something that tops it , and when they tell me they paid only  .

99 for theirs , and i tell them mine is free , and it takes the wind out of their iphone sails  .

very satisfying .

this phone is great  .

im actually suprised at how smooth the os works (on both models)  .

im an avid android fan and i definatly feel that motoblur compliments the power of android , as well as enhances the experiance of the os itself  .

dont let a few bad reviews fool you , unless you get a defected phone off the top , then this phone is a great buy  .

ive used every android phone t    mobile has and ill be blunt besides the original cliq and the xt , they all suck period end of story , i had two g1s they were the slowest p  .

ive probably ever owned (like grandpas computer slow) , i went through 3 mytouch 3gs they were a little better with the battery life and a little faster but still crap all the same  .

then i picked up the cliq and i is in love  .

other than os 1  .

5 , which until recently i thought i is stuck with (w/o rooting) , and the fact that it is fat and heavy , it is a brillient phone  .

then the xt came out , so i upgraded to it and havnt looked back since  .

its physically the exact opposite of the original making it taller skinnier and lghter , so putting it in your pocket for a while isnt a problem if you can manage to put it down .

do not be distracted by others who are trying to take away from the greatness of this phone  .

it is a great performer for what it is currently capable of and when it gets its upgrade later this year it will be even greater  .

tmobile and motorola did a great job on this phone and i recommend it to anyone who isnt looking for a droid x but a phone that they can easily carry with them anywhere and with the power of android  .

its a great phone for us normal folks new to android market  .

needs the android update just waiting on motorola , if you are a looking for the next thing to blow the market away    not the phone for you , go buy a $400 android phone  .

i would recommend this phone .

i needed a phone that could read pdf files and not through an email attachement  .

it does it great  .

i do not spend any time searching for my favorate things since i have so many places to put my apps and shortcuts .

excellent phone to buy (especially for the first time android user)  .

i read every review and forum i could find , looking for the perfect calling plan with the best cheap android phone available  .

the phone did not need to be the latest greatest , but it had to work well , and satisfy my desire to pocket an all    inclusive multi    media device for decent picture taking and music listening experiences , as well as real web browsing , email , messaging , and of course have decent call quality i initially chose the htc hero due to sprint's best    valued family plan , and because the cliq xt overly emphasized social networking that i cared nothing about  .

all reviews and photos of the two phones showed the hero with a well    designed home screen , while the cliq xt appeared as cluttered with crap although we both liked the hero phones and sprint family plan , we could not accept the limited sprint coverage in our area  .

fortunately there is no penalty to return the phones after 25 days of use i then ordered two cliq xts with t    mobile family plan (zero upfront cost) , directly from t    mobile online at 2pm , paid $12 for overnight shipping , and received my activated phones the next day here are some of my comparative observations , which despite my extensive research , i did not know about until after living with the phones ; listed in no particular order    .

music and other audio through the front    facing speaker sounds much richer on cliq xt in comparison to hero , important to me in light of absence of an audio    equalizer on all android phones    cliq xt connected music player is cool  .

i especially like the synched lyrics , and the excellent responsiveness while using 7gb of music files    call voice quality is significantly better on cliq xt in my experience , when compared to hero    keyboard accuracy and ease of text entry is much better on cliq xt , and swype is a bonus feature which also works well with practice    cliq xt touch screen is responsive and there is little sluggishness in comparison to hero in my experience    cliq xt screen quickly rotates to landscape in either direction , which may appeal to left    handed persons    beautiful widgets from android marketplace (~$2) adds some cool hero    like home    screen features to the cliq xt which i liked  .

it is easy to delete unwanted social networking widgets and simply not register social networking accounts , so the cliq xt functions smoothly and is now configured exactly as i wanted    very convenient screen brightness adjustment widgets actually work on cliq xt , unlike on hero  .

(i could not use the hero's automatic brightness feature because the screen would become unreadable for my old eyes in low    light , and the constantly varying brightness is annoying  .

voice command voice dialing feature on the cliq xt actually works very well , whereas this feature is virtually useless on the hero in my experience    bluetooth pairing with motorola s9 headset worked perfectly on cliq xt , sound quality is good , hands    free voice dialing worked perfectly , with no need to touch the phone in my pocket    cliq xt does not have the susceptibility to dust accumulating under the screen's glass that one of my two hero phones suffered in just 2 weeks of home/office usage (apparently a common hero problem)    cliq xt screen has less glare and is more resistant to fingerprint smudging than hero    camera picture quality on cliq xt is far superior to the always blurry photos i is achieving with hero  .

i cannot emphasize this point enough  .

there is much less non    removable bloatware on the cliq xt , resulting in 164mb of free memory space out    of    the    box , available to me to downloaded apps/data  .

(this despite the apparent 32mb memory    size advantage of the hero  .

the youtube app actually works on the cliq xt , but not on hero    simple cable connection of cliq xt to win7 pc with no software to install , and then hero acts as a disk drive for easy file copy    the cliq xt offers choice of using a traditional security passcode to lock the phone , plus the lockout time can be set to occur immediately when the screen sleeps , or after a specified period independent of the screen going to sleep  .

the hero only has the poorly designed android lock pattern feature , where you trace a shape on the phone screen , which then often remains quite visible as a fingerprint smudge , and is therefore a possible security risk    unlike the hero , the cliq xt stores incoming email and text messages to precious internal storage memory and not to the sd card  .

messages should be stored to sd card which would allow me to retain a much larger sampling of past email and text messages    very difficult to remove the battery cover on the cliq xt , especially the purple cover in my experience , which simply would not come off , even when using the thumb leverage trick shown in motorola's video on this subject    like all android phones , the lack of a global text    sizing feature for us middle    aged folks , is a major oversight  .

in summary , i will say that i much prefer the cliq xt over the hero updated  .

on may 10 , 2010  .

although not the biggest and baddest android phone out there , this baby more than holds its own  .

it's sexy , easy in the hand , and fun to use .

this is a great android phone  .

i is looking to leave tmobile at the end of my contract until they offered this phone to me for free to stay  .

since i is looking for an android phone anyway , i figured why not  .

this phone is pure awesome  .

great apps , great quality , great clarity  .

i have never had any issues with any of the motorola phones i've had in the past (6 in total over the years) and this phone is no exception  .

the tmobile 3g network if not available everywhere , but that's not a deal breaker for me  .

you just have to deal with the slower edge network from time to time  .

only bad thing i can say is the battery life just sucks  .

i have to plug in every other day  .

again , not a deal breaker , but annoying  .

none of the android phones have great battery life anyway .

i bought this phone for my wife , who is not a phone geek  .

she went from an antique samsung flip    phone , which only makes phone calls and messages , to this fine piece of equipment  .

i will tell you that , prior to ordering the phone , she had zero interest in the smart phone technology  .

she wouldn't be able to tell the difference between an iphone and a jitterbug  .

after having it for less than one week , i see her face buried in that thing every time i look at her  .

like any new thing you are not familiar with , there is a learning curve  .

as each day goes by she becomes more and more happy with the cliq xt  .

also note this , she usually becomes frustrated by too many options/buttons/menus and so on  .

this device has been like therapy in that we have now opened her mind up to the possibilities of learning new things  .

not to say that it has been without occasional incidents of brief outbursts of profanity , but it has been a great device so far  .

the t    mobile 3g coverage has been great in the phoenix metro area , no dropped calls or slow web connections thus far  .

we also do frequent conference calling and utilize the speakerphone a lot  .

i have never been so pleased with the sound of a speakerphone than i am with this one  .

the call quality is great , clear , and lacks much of the background noise we used to hear on her other phone with all that being said , understand that this device is a great next step for traditional phone users  .

i know there are better devices out there for the more techno    savvy crowd  .

this has been easy to learn , easy to use , and is packed with great features for the money  .

we purchased it from walmart  .

com for $29  .

99 w/ a 2yr extension and the only regret we've had is not paying the extra $4  .

95 for expedited shipping (totally would have been worth it) as it took a full 8 days to get the phone  .

i normally abhor shopping at walmart , but the t    mobile sites price is $129  .

99 and amazon  .

com is $49  .

99 for the upgrade with same plan options  .

at least i did not have to physically go into a walmart and witness the unwashed masses shopping in their pajamas and slippers  .

in life , you take the wins wherever you can get them  .

this is the first android phone i've owned , so i had to learn how to use it from scratch  .

it took one evening of playing with it  .

easy to navigate the menus to get where i needed to be  .

the home screen has five panels or pages side to side which makes it easy to access the applications , similar to the desktop on a computer  .

downloads are fast , gps is accurate , camera works well , although the shutter lag is annoying  .

i prefer to be able to zoom while recording video  .

internet is fast and i haven't been to many sites that wo not load  .

battery life sucked the first two days , but has improved  .

very good unit , highly recommended .

this is my first android phone and i like it a lot at times       )  .

i only wish motorola/t    mobile would keep their promise and upgrade to android v2  .

1/v2  .

2 soon .

for a medium use kind user , the price is right i have had none of the sluggishness reported by other reviewers when i am using the motoblur stuff ( including google maps and other gps apps0 , and the phone  .

i have loaded about a 100 apps so far ; depending on the app there can be some hesitiation  .

quite happy with the device  .

but i knew that i is not getting a top of the line all the bells and whistes android when i ordered it  .

trying to figure out what phone to get next is difficult until this one came out  .

and so far , so good  .

i thought the 1  .

5 os would keep me form purchasing it much less keeping it  .

google maps beta will not work on 1  .

5 and this is my most used app  .

coming off the g1 with 1  .

6 , it is truly a step backwards to me  .

but with such nifty gadgets like motoblur and a 60 day trial of telenav , i decided to go all in  .

i am ever glad i did as the purple backplate looks better to me than the licorice that is included as well  .

the usb/wall charger are one unit that separates into 2 pieces when you need to connect the phone to the pc  .

the backplate is a little difficult to get off and the memory card is under there in it's own door like area  .

the phone has a standard 3  .

5mm jack for headphones at the top of the phone  .

sides are used for volume rocker , camera and on/off/standby buttons  .

also on the side is the plug    in are for the wall charger which is far better than the bottom of the phone if you ask me  .

gone is the trackball and it's been replaced with a pad like area  .

this as well as the menu , back , search and home keys are very flush and great to the touch  .

i would download the user guide from motorola's site for extras not found in the start guide that comes with the phone  .

another feature on the phone is swype    slide to type vs  .

tap to type each letter  .

so far , it's cumbersome for me but i think if you play with it , it probably gets easier to use  .

when the new os does come out on this phone , it will be a 5 out of 5 star provided the kinks that usually happen with new os additions are minimal  .

mms picture sending seems to be a woe right now that hopefully will be worked on for the future  .

i don't see myself retuning this phone as it has been very fun and educating at the same time  .

the ui is very crystal clear even though the roundness of the screen gets used up in blackness  .

the android market is not updated either  .

if you're coming from 1  .

6 , you might not find you apps , paid ones as well  .

contact developers to get some assistance with this  .

very satisfied even though i did not think i would be because of the os  .

motoblur has me hooked as it connects all of the social sites in one place  .

how cool is that  .

overall this is a very jazzy phone , feature wise  .

but the battery    life alone makes me want to return it  .

it's basically like a computer so with all the functions and extra features , basic features like , dialing , texting , clicking over and even hanging up are more difficult  .

i never did like motorola's anyway  .

i'm a samsung , nokia user , this phone is a free exchange , if i were to have paid for it i would be livid  .

i very much enjoyed the ui that motorola blur offers  .

it's easy to use , and aesthetically it is simple and elegant  .

the performance of the phone , however , is not worth the cost of the phone even if it is offered under $100 i would pass  .

if you're only interested in using this phone as a means of keeping connected to your social networks and could not care less about getting a full use of the thousands of android apps available in the market place , then i would say this phone is perfect for you if you're willing to limit the use of this phone to accessing facebook , twitter , and text messaging only  .

i would like to mention the great quality of pics and videos on this phone  .

it is simply awesome for a camera phone .

sorry all my con's didn't fit in the space provided cons continued    .

sound quality is terrible on phone calls  .

when not speaking it goes silent making the other end think you hung up    when i heard it is difficult to get the back off to put in or take out the battery/ micro sd card i didn't think it would really be a problem until i needed to take the back off and had to use a credit card to pry it off    as for motoblur it slows the phone down alot  .

it's confusing and doesn't even update often enough i really don't need something telling me every time some changes their profile pic or likes a status i did't use the motoblur , just downloaded the facebook and twitter apps that you open up and sign into  .

motoblur drained the battery way too much    the charger cord is only like a foot and a half long if you don't mind charging it and leaving it on the floor than it may not be a problem    small screen for text keyboard when vertical , when tipped horizontal for writing text its response time is about 3 seconds before it flips    micro sd slot  .

you need to remove the back of the phone and the battery to remove the micro sd card                      if you want something to play with and have cool apps on get an ipod touch the call quality takes away from the phone aspect after all it is a phone should not that have been one of their main concerns making this phone  .

i am sending it back and getting a blackberry bold 9700  .

considered the htc pro touch 2 but heard windows mobile is awful and it does not have a headphone jack t    mobile needs to step their game up and come out with some good phones and more choices .

for some reason these phones love to switch over to edge even if there is a 3/4 bar 3g signal avalible  .

i have to lock it onto 3g sometimes so it does not hand off to an edge tower and when i do a pick up at least 3 bars of 3g  .

seems to be the same with the cliq xt if you read the review and look at the pics wish motorola would fix this updated  .

on mar 17 , 2010  .

the motorola might look good and give impressive battery life , but you have to watch out and do your research on this phone  .

the phone is slow , and has too many problems  .

bottom line   go look at a different phone  .

really doesn't seem like much thought went into this phone whatsoever  .

there is no t9 texting off the bigger button keypad used for dialing out  .

that would only have made more sense to have put made the keypad buttons big enough for an adults fingers to push the buttons required for texting hello , uh how about putting the lock and unlock button in the same place  .

oh and how about not putting the lock button with the power off button  .

nice feature about texting is you can go back and review entire conversation with out having to read 20 different texts good luck trying to save a picture anyone sends you via text ringtones are all girly or obnoxious desktop picture application is totally worthless and blows pictures way off the screen    why bother having that  .

phone takes forever to turn on    feels like i could get in and out of shower before phone turns on battery does not last long and will not even last one days worth of using camera is actually very good  .

0 mega pixels and easy to use overall the phone is probably good for someone who wants functionality of a phone with a nicer looking appeal then many of the other cheap phones  .

although this phone does have internet , i have not used that    all cell phone makers take note    we do not need internet and ability to watch movies on our cell phones  .

the phone should offer internet but not be required    which is good about the motorola cliq i am really not impressed the phone does have some good basic features (which all cell phones should) such as    .

easy to use calculator  .

nice easy to use dial pad  .

good voice and signal transmission  .

so if you want a phone for the sake of having one that looks nice its probably good for that and only that  .

otherwise it will just annoy you .

i have never been so disappointed in a motorola phone  .

the cliq is my first android phone and i must say while i love the o/s i do not love the phone  .

the first one i received is a refurb , and it kept rebooting  .

so , i got a new one    and that showed many of the same problems ; the calls would drop and then the screen would lock and i had to reboot  .

i need to use in ear headphones and when i tried my jlab headphones , i found i could hear the music but not the lyrics , turns out this is a known issue after 2 bad handsets i decided to trade up ; to the vibrant  .

from what i read    it is a worthwhile choice  .

if a person is going from a simple flip phone to the cliq , they will be impressed  .

however , after using an iphone for the past two years , switching to this phone is like a major step back  .

i returned it after 3 days .

motorola continues to leave customers in the dark in regards to upgrading to android 2  .

1 , despite using it as a selling point  .

the gps feature on motoblur which allegedly allows you to find your phone will tell you which town you left your phone in , if that is all that helpful for you  .

having all of your facebook friends automatically as contacts , even the ones without listed phone numbers only makes it that much more difficult to find a person's number  .

all in all , if 2  .

1 ever comes out , wait to see what the response is before you even consider buying this phone .

when i bought the phone from best buy they showed me a comparison that said the battery lasted longer than the g1 , this is far from the truth , the g1 would last me almost 2 days , i can not even get through a business day on the cliq , and i am not on the phone all the time  .

i have not had to carry a charger to get my phone through the day for almost a decade , this is a huge step back  .

one of the great features of the android 1  .

6 upgrade on the old g1 , several months ago , is the new version of google maps with voice turn by turn direction , this is not available on the cliq as it is stuck in v1  .

while cliq is technically more capable than the g1 , and the motorola changes to the interface are nice , apparently these changes prevent regular upgrades to the phone's operating system and the big improvements that are being made to the base operating system on a constant basis the battery life kills this other wise nice (although only android version 1  .

5) phone  .

i am taking the phone back to best buy in the morning to get a different brand .

overall this phone is horrible , i had to get this phone reset to its factory setting 3 times in the 2 months that i have had it so far  .

i am looking forward to my upgrade next month .

even if is free do not buy it .

incredibly sluggish performance all around  .

want to make a call  .

first you have to access your home screen , then your contacts  .

grab a cup of coffee while you wait for your contacts to load , because it takes a while  .

think it might be quicker to do it through the dialer screen  .

guess again  .

none of your contacts that you loaded onto your phone will be sorted accurately anyway    i is told the phone would sync no problem with google contacts , and with a mac  .

not the case  .

i even tried using third party sync software and nothing will make this phone sync accurately with google , mac address book , or any other  .

i've been on the phone for more hours than i care to trying to sort this out  .

the end result is that the faulty syncing ended up duplicating contacts over and over , so i now have multiples of many contacts  .

think you can delete contacts like any other phone  .

nope  .

you have to delete them one by one or reset the entire phone , losing all your apps , bookmarks , et cetera in the process say you're sitting with friends and want to find something online  .

guaranteed , this phone will take twice as long as an iphone  .

calls get dropped constantly when flashing between two , and many times voicemails do not even appear until hours later , if at all  .

kills my business to have to depend on something so completely slow , unreliable , and pathetically user    friendly  .

i'm not sure what device the positive reviewers are using , but it cannot possibly be the one i bought  .

ugh updated  .

on oct 3 , 2010  .

originally i researched this product and purchased it due to the motoblur and texting features since i'm into the whole social networking scene  .

about a month after having the phone it began freezing up during text messages trying to force close or making you wait  .

after a while it began turning off on its own and would not restart unless you pulled out the battery  .

operates on 1  .

5 android service all the while 2  .

1 is available , but not for this phone due to motoblur  .

all in all it seems like a good phone with fun features , but it's not worth the purchase  .

updates are not in the near future per a t    mobile rep i spoke with today and it eats up battery life like no other phone  .

i had the droid and used it more and had better battery life  .

just from texting , not playing with apps , checking email or talking my phone must be recharged anywhere from three to four times a day  .

i've spoken to t    mobile and they have not a clue who to rectify the problems thus far  .

walk away before you're stuck with it  .

not worth it , unless you are a droid customer motorola could care less  .

move on to an htc phone or one of the new samsung galaxy s  .

if tmo would let me switch i would in a heartbeat  .

stay clear .

motorola and t    mobile should not be selling this to consumers it is a horrible disaster of a product  .

the promise to have an update to android 2  .

1 within a few weeks of purchasing the product seemed reasonable especially since many of the purchased apps that i worked flawlessly on my much older htc g1 do not operate at all on the cliq xt  .

i expected to move forward not backward when i upgraded (sarcastic expression) to the cliq xt i actually have started to cancel my service one line at a time with t    moblie over their unwillingness to take this cliq xt back and provide me with any reasonable alternative at no charge  .

their last paltry offer is that i could spend another $300 to buy a different phone i have been dealing with issues like e    mail that does not work for days , applications that will not operate at all , horrible support , and you want me to pay you more money for an upgrade  .

dear t    mobile you should be paying everyone that has purchased this cliq xt some money or get them a descent replacement phone and you should stop selling this phone immediately until motorola can actually follow thru with the promised update to android 2  .

also , motorola you should really consider letting users of this phone have an option to remove the bloated motoblur software because it seems to waste a lot of space compared to my g1 and my touch 3g  .

on a side note , did this reviewer chic get paid by motorola to write this review  .

i've always checked cnet before buying anything , no more  .

i am going to look for a different tech review site  .

how can you give this piece of sh  a 4 stars  .

it is going back to t    mobile right now .

i've taken it back to the store 4 times in the past week to have it re    booted  .

tomorrow i am taking it back and asking to return it .
