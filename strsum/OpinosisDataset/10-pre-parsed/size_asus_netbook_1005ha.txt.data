0 out of 5 stars perfect size netbook, september 23, 2009

his full sized laptop dies after about 2 hours of use .

smaller size videos   play even smoother .

screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .

the keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .

if i were looking to get work done quickly, i would pay the extra money to go full, sized, even if it's slower .

the screen size works just fine for me .

it's 90% size keyboard doesn't take too long to get used to .

surprisingly readable screen for the size .

the keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .
