great hotel with great rooms .

rooms in similar hotels would usually be about $250, 300 .

rooms were nicely furnished .

rooms in this hotel are noisy though .

rooms are dated, our corner room's bathroom was shabby .

great location nice rooms loved the swissotel !

rooms at the hotel are getting somewhat tired .

strange, we thought, since we had booked conceirge level rooms .

got to hotel, rooms weren't ready yet .

rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .

expensive parking but great rooms .

rooms very spacious and clean .

very pretty rooms with an european flair .

great location but rooms need some work .

we   and, unfortunately, got to stay in three different rooms .

but we really did spend very little time in our rooms .

but i guess they have to make money somehow since they practically give their rooms away .

our rooms   were still not ready by 8pm .

from other rooms but not nearly bad enough for us not to stay there again .

rooms were clean, good sized and great views of navy pier .
