i is highly skeptical about getting this phone because of the negative reviews , but i'm glad i went with my initial feeling and got the phone  .

i love it , it does everything i need it to do , and i am a power user , and it has not messed up on me once  .

i know there is a big gripe about users waiting on the os upgrade to 2  .

1 but i am completely fine with 1  .

5 for the mean time , it's running great for me and i know i'm sure the upgrade will come in time motorola said they are still working out some bugs  .

i've been a blackberry user and switching to this phone , i know i've made a good switch .

i'm worried about the keyboard durability    cnet are you trying to f  the phone  .

although a vag is one thing the phone is missing , but that's about it  .

if you are a normal human being , and not a nerd who uses every single app on the cell phone to the max , then this phone will be fine for you  .

i felt the need to write a review somewhere for the normal people , so i can let them know that this phone works great ; unless , like i said , you have no life , and worry more about 1  .

5 android software than say going out on a friday night and meeting a nice girl to take home but that is just my opinion  .

this phone perfectly performs every task i ask it to , and then some  .

it is a great design , and long story short i have completely forgot about my blackberry curve .

the good part of this phone is that it is also a handy heater/hot plate/cooker/ microwave the back heats up enough to perform the functions mentioned above    (  .

i dont mind the cons the pros rokkk so 5 stars give it a try  .

for 499 bucks its   but 100 bucks (att) roks  .

this is a great phone to get , especially for people who like messaging friends and updating their statuses  .

it's for people who like to connect and socialize unlike people who like how it looks or bragging about how cool it is but turns out they hate it  .

so for you socializers out there , get this and for the dumb ones who buy it and end up not liking it must like bragging and being a failure .

it is by far the best all around phone that there is  .

i think that you can compare this to the iphone  .

the only that that this thing cant do that iphone do is directly connect with itunes but thats why you get an ipod  .

this fone does have horrible battery life but if you think about all that it does it shouldnt get horrible battery life  .

i normally can barley go a day but i use pandora most of the day and browse the internet and play with some of the awesome apps that i have downloaded for free  .

this thing is an amazing multitasker  .

but if you use it heavy expect it to die sometime in the day  .

but remember that you cant have your cake and eat it to  .

do not bash this phone because you think its stupid or not as good as the motorola droid  .

this phone is for a different audience  .

i think that it is more for teens that are all about staying in touch with their friends and texting  .

nothing more really like i said before  .

this fone has more than fulfilled my needs and expectations  .

so far i have not found problems i'm not able to fix by adjusting a setting or finding an app or widget for  .

some might say the on    screen touch keyboard is too small  .

i have big hands (ring size 13) and i can easily type well aided by a word prediction bar that appears as you type  .

remember that swype is coming soon which could also help the fat    fingered alike widgets enhance motoblur's supreme integration of your desired news , unified message box and response capabilities giving you multiple avenues for resolving your social life/keeping up to date on the world all this without segregating yourself to one app at a time (iphone)  .

this phone has without a doubt decreased my effort needed to keep up with my co    workers , friends and poi's i want to maintain strong communication with once update to android 2  .

1 comes out (which motorola is adamant about releasing) this phone's capabilities will be phenomenal , especially if multi    touch is added to the feature list  .

my dream for this phone   the integration of multi    touch with backtrack .

i admit i is skeptical on the the backflip  .

i bought one on sunday anyway and planned to return it in the 30 day window after using it for the last few days , i love the phone  .

i thought the keyboard being on the outside would be a bad thing , actually i like it  .

it gives the device a secure feeling when holding it  .

because you are not just holding a plastic backing it feels very secure in your hand  .

the keyboard is slightly recessed and almost feels like a grip  .

the metal body also gives the phone a great feel and it doesn  .

t show fingerprints  .

the display is incredibly responsive and is capacitive not resistive  .

the camera faces you when the keyboard is open and makes for great self    portrait shots  .

i have picked up typing on the keyboard very quickly and i have no issues with the keyboard at all all in all , this phone is a pleasant surprise for me  .

i do not play games and such on a portable device so the performance on this phone has been more than adequate for me  .

i like the narrow (candybarish) dimensions and the thickness is about right  .

this device is only ever so slightly thicker than the pure i is using prior  .

i have owned three iphones and two other android phones (g1 and mytouch) and i am much happier with the backflip than any other phone i have owned the whole yahoo instead of google is not of much concern for me  .

i already changed my browser to default to google as the home page  .

i never really use the widget search bar anyway  .

i am also confident that some hacks will take care of changing the default back to google soon enough  .

i also do most of my searches in wikipedia and there is an app for that i am pleasantly surprised by how much i am enjoying the blur interface as well  .

no real complaints there either  .

sure , there are a few things that can improve but nothing is perfect  .

time will take care of any minor issues yes , it could have a faster processor but for my needs it doesn  .

t seem to be an issue  .

the phone feels solid and the keyboard should hold up as well as any other candybar phone with a keypad does  .

i am definitely happy with this purchase i  .

m not trying to convince anyone to buy the backflip , just wanted to give my opinion after using it for a few days .

i'm not sorry that i got this phone  .

comments made on this site was not all true , this phone is better then what is said  .

i've spoken to 3 other people i know who has this phone as well and their all very happy with it too  .

great phone  .

it's a great phone , really  .

i enjoy the camera and the keyboard (when it cooperates)  .

i am satisfied with the 2 day battery life (it's a smart phone , what do you expect  .

uses a standard mini    usb plug , which i own several of already  .

i'm the envy of my friends , supposedly if you are looking for a simple android phone , this is a great phone for a low price  .

if you are looking for a business phone , try the blackberry , droid , or iphone instead .

i is looking for a different kind of phone with a qwerty keyboard  .

i saw this phone and thought it looked cool and interesting  .

at first it is a little confusing but like anything else after you use it for awhile , it becomes easy to use  .

it does get slow and lag , but i downloaded an app killer and that took care of the problem for the most part  .

it seems it runs slower when there are a lot of texts in the inbox  .

i was not really concerned with how good the camera is on my phone but the camera on this phone takes great pictures  .

i is also hapy it has a flash  .

i like the fact that you can put whatever you want on your home screen like texts weather etc  .

it is a little difficult to texts on the touch screen but i mostly use the keboard so it really is not a big deal to me  .

there is supposed to be an update for android 2  .

1 so hopefully any problems will be resolved with the update , overall i love the phone  .

i really like my motorola back flip  .

seems to be a very dependable phone  .

have not had any problems with it so far  .

it seems to be very easy to use and features have been simple to figure out  .

i would recommend the phone to anyone who likes gadgets , but if you are looking for simplicity do not buy it .

i like more about the phone than i dislike  .

i'm certainly not unhappy that i bought it .

the lack of 2  .

0+ firmware is just a bit saddening but it is honestly no big deal considering all you can do with this phone  .

it might take a bit of time to adapt and find out where everything is , but once you do , it helps you so much  .

heck , now i do not have to keep a million membership cards in my wallet anymore  .

it does everything android does    everything , except microwave and laundry cleaning  .

for those who complain about not knowing which apps run in the back , well , there's an app (oh irony) , who lets you check that , and close the apps running in the back and draining your battery  .

the phone even becomes a night clock when you plug it in and flip it on your night stand  .

i really like the phone so far , i know it doesnt have the newest os available (there will be an update in the near future) and i know its not an iphone , but as far as features this phone is incredible  .

i love the setup , easy to navigate , easy to customize once you get the hang of it  .

like i said previously , so much synchronization its insane ; google contacts , email , myspace , facebook , twitter , you name it , one inbox , and all the contacts in your contact list  .

motoblur is taking some time to get used to , but i really think some of the features on this phone are extremely innovative  .

if you want to spend $300 on an iphone , i say go for it  .

but if you want an affordable phone and use social networking sites , this is definitely the phone for you .

i bought this phone for my wife , a distinctly non    smartphone user  .

i got her the phone so that she would start using email , and it has worked  .

she had gotten to the point where she was not turning on her computer at home , or using email at work , but now , with the simple integration afforded by having a gmail account , she's doing email  .

the phone therefore has met and in fact exceeded expectations  .

it is simple to find and add new apps , throw out all the at t stuff they preinstalled on the desktop .

blur puts everything important on a single screen (new messages from multiple mail boxes , texts , facebook updates)  .

it's awesome  .

i had 2 configuration issues that were easily resolved (gmail has to be added as an email account to show up in the universal inbox , my blur contact is merged with my husbands    there's an edit option and link/unlink opton on the contact so i is able to change my name and unlink me from his facebook account) cool how you can stand it up for an alarm clock or to play music  .

speakers sound pretty good  .

keyboard is easy to use for me  .

i perfer it to no physical keyboard and it has the trackpad on the back (you can disable it if you do not like it) bottom line  .

i love this product mostly because of the universal inbox messages from any service all on my home screen along with facebook updates , plus customization on this screen , so i added my husband's icon so i can call him from this screen as well  .

plus it has all the expected things already there on this blur screen like weather and the clock and easy navigation to apps  .

fun to have google maps with gps that works finally  .

market place has lots of free downloads  .

i'm pleasantly surprised with my purchase .

good phone bad at t slow motorola upgrade  .

the motorola backflip is a pretty decent phone  .

i love the android os and cannot wait to see what the 2  .

1 update will do since this is my first android based phone , but what doesn't make sense is that a phone is not sent out brand new with 2  .

1 already have been released  .

text messaging is threaded and to me that is a must  .

it does load kind of slow , but it is nothing too slow that makes you sit there and wait for a few minutes for it all to load  .

i have to have email and since this is a smart phone it does give access to multiple accounts and even has a universal mailbox which shows messages from all of your email accounts , messages on facebook , text messages , etc  .

all in one box this phone comes loaded with motorola's motoblur which opens up a new quick way to access all of your social networking  .

i haven't used it all that much but i grasped the idea of it and it is something amazing for all of you social network geeks  .

one thing on the past few phones i have had has been that you could not customize your notification (text , email) sounds with out some sort of manipulation that voids a warranty  .

this feature is new and i enjoy having that kind of power on my phone the 5mp camera works great so far for the past week i've had it  .

over 100 pictures taken and i cannot say that i've had any disappointments with it  .

of course , this is a phone and not a camera  .

the flash works great and takes great pictures in low light areas  .

i haven't used the camcorder feature much , but it does take great video  .

the sound is not all that great though  .

the only microphone is one you make calls with and usually when you take video , the phone will be closed at that microphone will be facing away from the person or thing you are recording the backtrack is a touch pad device on that back of the touchscreen  .

it works pretty well and works just as a touch pad on a laptop would  .

scroll around items and double tap to choose , simple as that  .

the keyboard is very big and the surface is flat  .

personally , i like this and the fact that there is not much feedback from the keys when pressed  .

i've been using the iphone for two years and this almost mimics the flat , no feedback when pressed that i've been used to for so long  .

the android on screen keyboard is small , but responds well  .

auto correct and predictive texting works great though i use the physical keyboard more than anything  .

landscape texting is not bad either the battery is not bad at all  .

i've read that most people complain about it  .

go to settings and set it to smart mode , don't have all kinds of constant auto    updating social widgets such as myspace , facebook , and twitter  .

those are killers i'm sure  .

one morning i left at 5am with a full battery and the phone didn't die until 9am the next morning  .

i text almost all day and receive several emails that were checked and replied to that same day  .

personally , i don't see anything wrong with it  .

smart mode is a very nicely added feature to the phone's power settings for the touchscreen   nothing much really  .

it works and doesn't lag unless the processor is being overloaded some things that i do dislike about the phone is the fact that at t has placed restrictions on leaving the phone to be an open source like android is meant to be  .

i think it is ridiculous that they have to have such things happen  .

for one , it is my phone and open source means user customization to my preference at times the phone does get slow  .

most apps do not auto kill themselves so i bought an app that allows me to task manage  .

it does free up space but sometimes programs like that can cause problems so you have to be careful using them  .

the processor could be better , but i think the main problem is having so many constant active widgets overall i like this phone  .

4/5  s  .

at t's restrictions and lack of a faster processor , and no current support for a software version that has been released before the phone's release keeps me from giving this phone 5/5  s definitely a phone to buy if you want a smart phone that is not hard to adapt to and use .

this phone is a decent phone  .

had a little trouble with it in the beginning when i first purchased it  .

the touchscreen is really touchy and the keypad is really nice to have  .

the camera 5mp and has a flash which for a phone is really good quality  .

there is quite a few free apps you can download for this phone  .

the battery life is not so good on it though , but i believe that may be the same thing with any type of smartphone  .

its limited on accessories because there is not many things you can buy for the phone as in cases and such , but then again it is a newer phone and that stuff takes time  .

in the beginning i had a lot of problems with it freezing but i've had it for a while now and its not doing as much as it is in the beginning when i first purchased the phone  .

overall it is a really nice phone to have .

this is a phone that in my eyes , is the border between phones like the lg chocolate touch or samsung instinct and smartphones  .

it has styling and power of a 3g enhanced phone and a smartphone os  .

i recommend it for teens and college students .

03    29    10  .

first and foremost , please be aware that i am just your regular cell phone user from at t  .

while i may be inexperienced with how to review smart    phones , i have come to learn a few things about the motorola backflip through my own personal experience with it  .

also note that i've only had this phone for less than a month what i truly love about the backflip is the overall interface  .

it's fast , responsive , and great to toy with  .

the touchscreen interface is , in my opinion , probably just as good as an iphone  .

however , because this is an outdated version of the android , i am well aware of the bugs that weren't fixed in this version , which could possibly affect the phone's performance  .

but in defense , i have yet to see this perform sluggishly when scrolling down menus or opening apps after apps i'm not sure why cnet gave a mediocre review on the camera that the bacflip possesses  .

first of , that quite a bit of lag when starting the camera is how it has always started  .

you're suppose to hold down the dedicated camera button in order to bring out the application for it  .

this is probably put in so people wouldn't have to accidentally draw out the camera application  .

for quality , this does pretty good   all you have to do is point    and    shoot (mind you that the camera does have to focus and then take the shot  .

but all cameras do that as well  .

) for the video , i'll just let you judge for yourself   http  //www  .

youtube  .

com/watch  .

v  hv59alcjqoq  .

but what this phone is known for is it's socializing capabilities such as going on facebook and twitter  .

all this can be done in an application called happenings  .

basically , you log onto your accounts on these socializing networks , and what motorblur will do for you is sync all your friends from all your socializing networks and sync them with your contacts list  .

big turn off  .

the problem with this is that sometimes the phone cannot recognize if certain people are the same person or not  .

in my case , i had 3 specific contacts that shared the same name (mainly because it is the same person) , but is added separately instead of synchronizing itself with the existing name  .

maybe a few more fixes and this will catch on , but as of now , i would not recommend them using this as their selling point  .

what i did is instead of using the happenings application , i downloaded the facebook application for free from the market and am using that instead of the happening application  .

i may not get notifications as fast , but at least my contacts is nice and clean once again for now , this phone is a good contender in the smart    phone war  .

let's see what else it can do in the near future once this baby is packed and loaded with the android 2  .

1 version  .

once i've got that and played with it for about a month , i'll rewrite my review  .

for now , 4 stars for you love  .

awesome upgrade phone especially with the $100 rebate so you pay nothing for the phone  .

been an at t wireless customer for years and have never had any issues with customer service at all  .

i can see why this phone gets sold out quickly  .

the only issue with it is the battery life .

i have had the phone for 3 days  .

have no problems with it  .

i have already downloaded over 100 apps (some good some bad)  .

the phone is relatively easy to use  .

keyboard is not nearly as bad as some nmake it out to be , but it does take some getting used to if you are used to using a full touch screen phone  .

i would not recomend this phone if you are a current smart phone user  .

if you are upgrading from a non    smart phone it is ok though  .

over all good first android for att .

nice phone  .

better to buy from walmart for free with a 2    year contract (new or renewal)  .

that's a big savings from the at t store and you do not have to wait for a rebate .

i love the phone because its not a dreaded iphone had one went through three (hate apple lol) android is the future and fell this phone will get better in time  .

love the apps love motoblur software thought i would hate it but it became easy to use love the clear hi res screen you    tube videos are really clear love the camera its nice  .

the thing i hate is the battery life it cant keep up with me and apparently everyone hopefully the upgrade to 2  .

1 fixes things  .

i've had this phone for about one month and i've liked it very much  .

it's my first android phone , nad i like the os a lot ; however i know that i'm missing out on some cool features that are in later versions the build is very good and the reverse hinge design is cool and easy to use  .

the keyboard is also good , but the virtual keyboard is only suitable for 2 year olds , who are not likely to be using mobile phones and are also not motorola's target audience the market is really satifying and the browser is ok  .

calls are very good and the motoblur is good too  .

however , the phone takes a lot of time to boot up and is a little slow when you are scrolling on lists .

i came from a old flip phone , so this blew me away  .

i think the 5 windows are more than enough  .

i usually don't need instant access to the application in any case  .

the phone does a nice job of syncing all your gmail and facebook contacts , but it can create duplicates  .

a little time linking up the contacts is not too much to ask  .

at times the phone can be a little laggy , but i haven't ran into a computer device that doesn't have the occasional hiccups  .

it is a solid mid    grade smart phone device that has a physical workable keyboard  .

the motoblur software has its pros and cons , but overall it does a nice job of updating for those that cannot be a second behind in the update that their friend had a turkey sandwich for lunch  .

it is geared for the virtual friend   , but it is a phone i don't think an adult would be embarrassed to use i do not find the screen too small , and anyone that does is just used to the megatron screen real estate that seems to be the norm now  .

personally i find it refreshing not to pull a laptop out of my pocket  .

the delayed os updates are only annoying in that they have to develop them with motoblur in mind , and that cnet thinks anything over 2 months old is the equivalent of a commodore 64  .

it is worth the price .

att lobotomized the android platform  .

google search has been replaced with yahoo , which is disgusting  .

and they've prevented users from installing any apps that were downloaded anywhere but the android market  .

(there is a way around this , so research it  .

) motorola failed to include the newest versions (or even relatively new) of android , giving us 1  .

5 instead of the newer 2  .

1 or higher  .

hopefully they'll have software updates for us soon for die hard (or simply stuck with) att customers , the backflip is great  .

specifically because it's the only android phone att has available  .

(unless you get an unlocked phone  .

) regardless of it's three major crippling features (yahoo search , lack of ability to install non    app store apps , and non    updated android) it's still a far sight better than the highly restrictive platform that is the iphone , and has greater functionality than the available blackberries  .

there is still hope that motorola will roll out software updates to get us to the newer android platforms , which will make the phone far better , but until att releases a patch to fix the yahoo search and app installs this will remain a substandard phone  .

lots of available information on the backflip at the backflip forums  .

any search engine should be able to find them .

calling this phone slow seems to be unfair as it is an entry level android phone  .

it obviously cannot compare to the droid in the horsepower department  .

performance has been no slower than my iphone 3g (except the camera)  .

though the android os may not be as slick as the iphone , being able to have widgets constantly running on your desktop and having some apps be able to run in the background more than makes up for any clunkyness in the user interface  .

state of the art it may not be , but the backflip is a solid and affordable smart phone  .

i just hope a future update will allow us to get rid of the at t bloat    ware do not hold your breath .

bottom    line i would recommend this phone to others  .

its probably the best phone under the iphone  .

and i think with all its spectacular features and fix those problems it has the potential to be the next competitor of the iphone  .

this is a good phone if your upgrading from a feature phone , but if you're looking for power , look elsewhere  .

the over    all design of the unusual form factor proves to be a success , because since the sliding mechanism is replaced by the hinge , you have more space for the keyboard  .

since the form factor brings the phone to an (almost) acrobatic ability , there is something called the table    top mode which when the phone is cocked to a 90    45 degree angle , it displays an alarm clock with the weather with dimming capabilities and photo    frame capabilities motorola's software , moto    blur , brings all social networking sites to you at your home screen , (to learn more visit motorola's website)  .

this feature proves to be very useful if you have multiple social networks , other than that it may not prove anymore useful than just opening a social networking app that you downloaded from the on    board app store  .

android looks beautiful on this device , but as far as it runs , it could be way better  .

speaking of which , the speed of the phone is nearly mediocre  .

it is somewhat responsive , but opening apps could be more speedy , and the phone will sometimes freeze  .

even though this is native to the iphone , i believe the phone would be worth 4 stars if they made it faster , (for example ; the motorola backflip carries a 528 mhz processor , while the nexus 1 carries a 900 mhz)  .

other than that , the phone feels very solid and fits right into your hand  .

the call quality is amazing  .

it sounded like i is on a land    line and the people who i is calling thought i is on a land line , and the speakerphone quality is amazing it could be paralleled to a computer  .

in addition to good speakerphone quality , the speaker sounded great when playing music or watching videos , but of course there is the 3  .

5 mm headset jack , (which basically means that you can use regular headphones instead of needing an attachment)  .

also , the radio on the device is phenomenal  .

i could get a signal in places where before , i have not  .

and , because of that , the internet speed is pretty darn quick sometimes the device can be a little laggy , and not as responsive as the iphone or nexus 1  .

the phone has a serious problem with internal storage  .

there's only so much space on the device that you would have to use a storage card for the pics and other media , while the apps (can only) stay on the device  .

another thing i want to note is that the camera app seems to freeze (sometimes) while in use , and automatically shuts down the entire phone  .

after about a couple days of use , it's very annoying and i'm definitely willing to return it because i use my camera a lot .

day 29   the phone randomly rebooted on 4 different occasions  .

progressively gets worse today , day 40 , it has already rebooted 11 times , all within a 2 and a half hour time frame , all while trying to text and share pics omg so very frustrating , i cannot wait to get another phone  .

other cons   touch screen too sensitive (i inadvertently call people while using it , and i accidentally hang up on calls when my face touches the screen) , within the first month gradually lagged more and more , now reaction time to touching is very slow i touch the screen and when it does not react i'll touch again (and sometimes again) and then it finally catches up all at once therefore going way past the point in which i intended to be  .

warning   you must have lots of patience to continue loving this phone  .

bottom line , i enjoy this phone considering i had the lg neon which is a great qwerty phone , i is looking for more of a touch screen .

i've been trying this phone for a week now  .

my old phone is an old flip phone so this seems pretty incredible to look up things on the internet and send emails  .

i did not like it when i went to sleep and the phone had run out of battery and like they say the keyboard could be a little better  .

somewhat hard to input but decent  .

i prefer it to the iphone on screen keyboard there are newer phones that are fast and have more features but i'm sure they cost more to the 50$ i paid for this one a good basic droid phone  .

this is a perfect phone for someone young or just looking to keep in touch w/ people  .

i loved it for that purpose  .

i only have fb and i ended up always talking w/ people and i like how it syncs w/ those contacts so i have everyone's email/phone info  .

the keyboard is kind of hard to type on b/c you have to press the buttons since they're so flat  .

the android marked it so extensive it's hard to just browse and find good stuff  .

the phone is also a bit slick and i have to focus for it not to slip out my hand  .

feels kind of cheap sometimes  .

backtrack is cool but not too practical when there's already the touch screen and keypad to use it i have to hold the phone a certain way and its not that responsive either  .

again , great phone for keepin in touch w/ social networking but otherwise i'll pass since i already come from a blackberry lineup .

this would be a great phone to introduce people to the world of smartphones , the android os is alot better than what i remember microsoft having  .

however , i purchased this phone after i had an iphone for almost 2 years  .

this phone just doesn't come close to being as easy to use as an iphone in my opinion this phone also seems to go into standby really quickly , and this is after i adjusted the standby time to 2 minutes  .

it appears that in some parts of the os the phone ignores your settings and shuts the screen down , but this may have to do with the limited battery life the physical keyboard is nice for typing out longer emails or blog posts ultimately this phone will help you understand why apple is so peticular about how features are implimented on the iphone  .

just because you can do something does not always mean that its done well .

this phone overall is a regret and if i had the extra money i would replace  .

i do not like the motoblur operating system , it is always freezing and restarting its self  .

the fact that it is still on 1  .

5 android version is rather ridiculous since when i bought it i is told that it is going to be upgradeable soon and 6 months is not soon  .

lastly , the move by at t to strip the phone with many of the signature android apps and abilities and filling it up with unremovable at t bloatware is not a smart move at all  .

look , the reason you want an android phone is so that you have access to the wide array of third    party apps without being locked in to apple's restrictive developer policies  .

android is an open system , the major benefit of which is more access to cool toys and , for more techie folks , a sandbox to play in for some mind    bending reason , either at t or motorola chose to build this thing around the 1  .

4 version of android which nobody writes apps for  .

want the new kindle app for android  .

nope , only on newer android versions  .

map software  .

wordpress  .

facebook  .

twitter  .

text    to    speech  .

games  .

too bad there are lots of apps out there , but for the most part , all i've found in the marketplace are bottom    shelf , unstable or reduced functionality apps  .

it's not the developers' fault       it's the old android implementation second gripe   at t loads it up with bloatware that you can not uninstall , and if you open once , will be charged a monthly fee for  .

the menu is littered with junk that you can not get rid of , can not hide , and can not folder third gripe   it crashes randomly a few times a week  .

sometimes when using third party apps , but usually doing something tricky like making a phone call or opening the menu screen fourth gripe   the battery only lasts half a day , even if i do not use it at all       no wifi , no gps , no bluetooth  .

just phone/data turned on , with the phone in my pocket not being used , if i turn it on at 7am it'll be dead and shutting down by 7pm fifth gripe   there is no way to turn off or control apps without downloading a third party app manager i'm pretty fed up with this phone  .

i is already locked into at t , so i is excited to see that they had an android phone , but man , did they screw this up  .

i wish i had waited another month and gotten an iphone4  .

it has issues , but nothing even close to this tin toy .

despite what i read , i is head over heels in love with this phone when i bought it  .

since then , i have watched it get easily bogged down with the simplest of tasks  .

just moments ago i could not access the camera , and the screen is virtually frozen until i ran the task killer  .

at t did well to introduce us to the android system , but should have brought in higher end phones  .

maybe things will get better when/if the software is updated as it stands , it can barely run a single app  .

if you try to run two , the phone slows down  .

personally , i am going to switch to verizon and get the droid x  .

the android platform is awesome , but like a kid , it needs room to play  .

when i first got this phone i is excited to have the new droid for att  .

i should have known there were going to be problems when i tried setting up the motoblur account and the phone kept showing an error message  .

i have never had a phone that is so slow to surf the internet  .

motorola definitely needs to come up with updates to work the bugs out  .

if you are debating between this and the iphone , stick with the iphone , i've had both .

the phone has a great feel  .

large keyboard that is not that awkward to use as it may seem if you have not held a phone  .

very nice concept  .

however , lack of transparency and at t's lockdown of the phone made me return the phone before the 30    day trial is over  .

i am still hoping to be able to get it again if and when it upgrades to android 2  .

1 and gets its restrictions removed .

at t needs to start getting a hold of phones like verizon has  .

the are one of the top cell phone companies , why do they not have the top phones  .

the iphone is legit , but verizon has such a better selection .

will remain on android 1  .

5 for the best combined hardware and software experience  .

this is on their official site now for asia    pacific https  //supportforums  .

motorola  .

com/community/manager/softwareupgrades  .

what the heck is that supposed to mean  .

i bought this phone cos i loved the keyboard , and they promised a later upgrade to 2  .

i never thought that that promise would turn into one big fat lie  .

shame on you motorola  .

i will never buy another phone from you as you have demonstrated a lack of accountability and total disregard for your customers needs  .

you have obviously decided to move on and concentrate on marketing new phones rather than dedicate your efforts to deliver on a promise  .

tsk tsk .

i think they had a great concept , just that it needs a better system to operate  .

plus comes pre    loaded with many apps that you will never use and they take up alot of memory .

i is eligible for upgrade from my iphone 2g 4gb  .

i got my moto backflip on a wednesday and is ready to take it back on friday  .

i only got it because it is free for me  .

i cant say i regret it bc i told myself that it is just for trial  .

a trial the backflip failed  .

i am to the point that i often want to throw my iphone byut i gladly crawled back to it after two days of using the slow , inefficient , buggy backflip it wont   fetch my email , remember to lock my screen , remember my passcode , do anything with expedience in one day it fogot that i had screen lock on twice and i had to reboot the phone for teh lock to activate  .

it uses battery very rapidly  .

it just stopped opening tweetcaster after only having it installed 22 hours  .

i honestly dont understand how they could have released this and nott somthing mor comparable to the devour which , imo , is a much better dvice i sent it back today and will be using my ragged iphone 2g until i feel like picking up a captivate of 3gs (of maybe a bold) .

do not waste your time  .

i upgraded from a blackberry curve which would have gotten reception at the bottom of a coal mine , and sacrificed major reception  .

i am returning my 2nd backflip in as many weeks and probably going to a proven product like an i    phone .

i want to like it but it's gives me headaches  .

if you do not want headaches get a different phone .

well , if the keyboard is almost useless , it makes the phone pretty useless , unless you just want to talk on it and what would be the point in buying a smartphone just for voice  .

i is so excited about getting this phone and now i cannot wait to return it  .

i have narrowed it down to either the lg arena which has great reviews and also does not come with the large data fee , but is full touch screen (something i am not sure i could get used to) , or the blackberry bold 9700 with a physical qwerty keyboard and large data fee  .

i currently have a blackberry and wanted to go for something a little more fun but no can do the backflip  .

anyone have an lg arena  .

screen is little small , and the text is a bit too small to read long paragraphs (i think they did that to fit more text on the screen)  .

touch responsiveness can be sluggish sometimes , and that track pad on the back is pretty useless and hard to reach when holding the phone in normal position  .

i cannot believe that at t would lock the phone up , is it something they did for apple  .

replacing google's search with yahoo makes no sense unless they got some deal with yahoo  .

also there are many of at t crappy programs that you cannot uninstall which reminds me of those little at t programs on their cheap budget phones i'm returning this thing tomorrow .

i am on my third handset in less than 8 months  .

each replacement brought a new disappointment the first dropped calls incessantly , the second worked fine for about 4 months then began ringing for no apparent reason and could only be stopped by removing the battery  .

with the third handset , i can clearly hear the caller , but regardless of where i am , the callers cannot hear me  .

i am totally disgusted with this phone .

this is the 2nd backflip i have had as the first is replaced as defective  .

the current phone has the same problem  .

resetting the software caused the phone to utilize 225 mb of data while on standby over 3 days  .

frequently misses incoming calls as the software freezes when trying to answer  .

additionally the phone freezes and can only be reset by taking out the battery for a few minutes and rebooting the system  .

the battery life is horrible , my first backflip only held a charge for around 5 hours (on standby) if used , the battery is drained within 2    3 hours , leaving the phone hot to the touch after 5 minutes useage or while charging .

would not recommend this to anyone .

the phone broke on day 40 of having this phone  .

when i called at t they were of no help phone shuts off for no reason , would had missed calls and texts  .

not a good phone at all  .

do not buy  .

it is great phone it can replace my iphone i dont miss my iphone when i am using this one , but battery problem need to be addressed .

i is really excited to get this phone i did my research before buying it and all the reviews were good  .

unfortunately i must have got the test phone because everything that could go wrong with this phone did and all in under 1 week  .

it sounded like i is muffled when on the phone  .

it would randomly start playing media and with no way to stop it had to turn phone off  .

started hanging up on calls and calling people randomly  .

overall it is a bad experience i is really disappointed hopefully they iron out all the kinks .

bottom line summary is that i've lost complete faith in cnet reviews because of this one review  .

3 1/2 stars for what every respectable gadget blog has called the worst android phone to ever hit the market  .

do yourself a favor and stay away from this  terrible  phone .

wouldnt reccomend this phone to anyone  .

android market for apps doesnt have any fail , but the phone its self has far to many the key pad being on the back of the phone (when not folded out) is a desing flaw , i've had mine 6months and the keypad is scrated and warn the battery life is only 3 hours being used or not the battery drains itself also , now when i use it i notice that the plate on the back of the phone (where the battery is) has loosened itself , ive tried taking it off and putting back on , but that doesnt help , it creeks like a loose floor board .

i have been with at t for a solid 3 years straight , and about another 2 years prior  .

but i am very unhappy with them  .

the phone i had before this one is a p  .

i had about 6 or 7 handsets and 3 batteries  .

came time to upgrade , never used a smartphone before but i knew a good bit about them  .

i am not a fan of the iphone  .

so , i figured this phone being the first android on the at t network would be the best choice for me  .

boy , is i wrong  .

out of the box i had a problem  .

i fully charged it like you are supposed to , about 4 hrs later it is dead  .

had to take it back the next day  .

this phone gives you the ability to link all your contacts to their myspace or facebook which takes forver  .

i spent like an hr doing this if not longer  .

goodluck if the phone has a myspace or facebook connection error all the linking is gone  .

this happened to me 2x and once all the pictures disappeared  .

only way to get pictures back is to delete fb/ms accounts and then re    sync them  .

i also had problem with being able to view my contacts  .

when i would click on a contact i would get an error msg and it would force close  .

so after a week i had to call at t and they made me do a master reset the on phone  .

lost all the contacts i had linked up for the like 4th time not to mention apps  .

i gave up on the linking , so what's the motoblur for now  .

phone freezes doing anything , receiving phone calls , surfing the web , browsing the happenings widget , texting , etc , when texting is full it will freeze , act really weird then delete all text and takes about a min before you can send a text  .

extremely annoying and frustrating  .

a text app fixed this problem for me up until the master reset , i just haven't felt like re    downloading loading all of my apps because i don't think the phone is worth it anymore you can only use at t nav which is $10/mo and search is locked to yahoo i got this phone when it first came out and i am now on the 4th battery and foresee another battery or handset in the near future  .

at t refusing to do anything about it  .

basically i am having the same problem as the last phone  .

is this a trend at t  .

if your looking for a touch screen phone that only works when it wants to and don ; t mind replacing the battery every 3mos then this phone is for you  .

if you do not want these frustrating problems stay far far away , even tho the phone is free now  .

once the other line on my account is out of contract , i am saying goodbye to at t and hello to big red .

i guess i just need a phone to call and text  .

can not make capital letters unless you put period at the end of a word  .

it just get frustrating whne you are talking and phone just shuts off  .

then it takes about two minutes to warm up  .

wish i never bought it .

i would suggest looking into other phones  .

i am on my 3rd backflip b/c att wont do sh t about their phone  .

i wouldnt recommend this phone to anyone .

this phone is useless  .

a waste of money  .

i'm currently visiting family right now and got the phone shipped to me  .

ever since i attempted to turn it on i've had problems  .

the only thing it's good for now is calls , even though i have to put it on speaker to hear it i is trying to text people one night and got really frusterated with it so i turned it off and took the battery out , hoping it would let me send 1 message and it wouldnt so i turned it off for the rest of the night until i woke up , on the charger , and it still would not work  .

if you are thinking about getting this phone , i reccomend looking around more when i get back home , i am so returning this  .

i returned the phone after almost a week of frustration  .

when i is in the phone store returning it , another customer made a comment about how she hated that phone , too .

avoid  .

best to wait for a better phone    google's nexus one  .
