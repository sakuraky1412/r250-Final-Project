ive had this tv since september of 2007  .

its been awsome to me ever since  .

i dont have hd programming , but i think its perfect for my xbox 360  .

the price has gone up on it though  .

i paid 550 for mine .

a few weeks ago i had purchased the new 32in samsung tv (with the little blue light at the bottom) for 999$  .

at first i is pumped to get that tv because it is supose to be the best  .

i get the samsung hook up my computer , satalite , dvd player , and speakers  .

first of all the pc is horrible , so i tried hdmi  .

my goodness it is worse  .

high definition multimedia interface cable and it is crap  .

so i had had it and returned that tv  .

(no offense to samsung lovers which i once was)so i set out to find an inexpensive television set that could do the things i needed with a good set or ports and quality  .

when i found this vizio tv i is in between buying this one  .

well , i went ahead and got it hooked up my devises and walaa  .

the quality and price were astonishing  .

compared to the new samsung this 400$ cheaper tv is greatly better at everything  .

i is very pleased with the many features of this tv and compared to others buy this one  .

you will save money and get a better tv  .

so that is it in a nut shell if you ask me  .

thanks  .

great tv  .

1080i , lots of connections to connect cable , videogames , dvd , blueray dics/ hd dvd , and comparered to what the video says on this product it does have pip (piciture in picture)  .

(unless i own a differnt tv that looks and wieghts same  .

down side is that the stand is not very strong  .

if you shake it very lightly you will see what i mean  .

other than that i have not had the slightest troble with it .

i cannot believe some of the negative reviews on here  .

one owner actually said that he expected more from a $600 tv  .

do you honestly think $600 is a high ticket price for a 32 inch hd lcd  .

if so , i'd like to know where you're shopping the bottom line   this is a superb tv if you're shopping on a budget  .

my wife and i are just finishing college and really wanted to get a new tv  .

we're on a tight budget right now , so we decided to get something smaller and less expensive to tide us over until we can afford a top of the line set  .

we settled on the vizio and couldn't be happier if you're a tv elitist , which we're not , then hopefully you can afford to pay 900    1000 for a 32 inch set  .

yes , i'll admit you can get better tv's than this one if you pay that much  .

i don't , however , think that you can get a better tv for this price setup is extremely simple  .

we're still using rabbit ears and the scan feature quickly found non    scrambled hd channels for every local station (we live in austin , tx)  .

the picture looks great to hd newbies like ourselves  .

we tweaked the colors a bit because it did have a reddish hue at times the main drawback we've found is the sound quality  .

luckily we're using a surround sound system for everything , so that hasn't been a major drawback  .

if sound quality is important to you , you might consider running audio out to a stereo/ss i highly recommend this to anyone who is shopping for a good flat screen lcd on a budget  .

like i said , it may not satisfy hd elitists , but if you're one of those i do not recommend shopping in this price range one last note , i'm surprised to see that cnet ranks the 37 vizio above this one  .

we tried that model first and took it back b/c we were disappointed in the color/clarity of picture  .

we've been much more satisfied with the 32 , even if it meant taking a hit in screen size j     .

i picked this tv up at circuitcity for a great price and haven't been happier  .

i went from an old 20 crt to this  .

it is great  .

i hooked my xbox 360 up to it and the games have come alive i did do some shopping around with other venders and products but for the pice this beat them hands down  .

the picture is clear and vibrant  .

it even has a game setting for the picture  .

the only thing i wish it did support is 1080p high def  .

but with 1080i it's still a great bargin  .

for the money and product you cannot go wrong  .

i compared it to many name brand products and it actually looked better than most i'm not sure what cnet is saying about the design and look  .

to me it looks very modern and sleek  .

it will go well in any setting and if you do not like the look of it vizio makes an all black version parting thoughts   if you are looking to a get a great gameing tv , upgrade from a crt or just looking for a good tv to watch high def programming you cannot go wrong buying this or any other vizio product thanks for you time and enjoy .

this hdtv is prolly the best 1080i tv that you will find under $700  .

it has many features which allow you 2 tweak the picture if you want (i would recommend it)  .

i use this tv for my ps3 in 1080i and its amazing  .

i feel obligated to review this tv because i spent months researching and reading reviews that others had provided  .

i finally settled on the vizio after looking at olevia , samsung and sony out of the box , this television is perfect  .

there is very little tweaking necessary and the picture is crisp and clear in hd and it's quite impressive with just a digital signal  .

before my cable is hooked up , i purchased an antenna and is totally impressed with the reception on both regular and hd local channels in my humble opinion , this is the best deal out there  .

i purchased mine from bj's wholesale club for $599 (32 )  .

i also bought the extended warranty which is only $30 bucks or so this tv is being used in a bedroom and it's a perfect size for this purpose  .

i would definately purchase another vizio i hope this helps those of you who    like me    are on the fence  .

just do it  .

wish they'd put a swivel base on these  .

going out to purchase one today  .

i got my vx32l at costco yesterday for 591  .

99 , i is flippin back and forth between getting vx32l , vx37l or the toshiba 37hl167  .

i deceided on vx32l based on good reviews here and elsewhere and sense i got it at costco if the 32 prove too small id have a easy return  .

well as soon as i unpacked vx32l i is glad i got the 32 anything larger would gave overwhelmed my medium size bed room  .

the most difficult thing of setup is moving my old 27 panasonic tv/dvd crt without throwing out my back , lol  .

open the box , put vx32l on its stand , plug it in , hook up the power assisted rabit ears , batterys inn the remote and powered it up  .

the setup program found all 43 ota hdtv stations , instant hdtv  .

hyppee  .

lol  .

any with zero twiking the picture looked very decent out of the box  .

next is upscaling panasonic dvd player though the hdmi , more joy  .

the only mild prat fall is forgetting to flick the switch on a older toshiba dvd/vcr combo player from s video to component out  .

everything so far looks great , i did a little tweaking , turn down the back light , brightness and constrast , and futzing with the color some , but for the price of 591  .

99 , it prefect for my uses and are very happy so far i'll post a update after ive maybe calibarated the set , but so far so very good  .

great value .

this is by far the best lcd that i own  .

the picture quality is stellar and very comparable to other brands priced over $1500 i have purchased lcds from samsung , lg and panasonic as well and found that this tv (about 1/3    1/2 the price) is very comparable  .

the pc connection on this model is very useful  .

overall , i found that this model that cost me $569 at sam's club is the best value and top performer in the growing class of lcd tv's  .

i highly recommend this , you wo not be disappointed .

ilove it , and a great price , my first hi    def and i did a lot of comparing and reading reviews and picked the right one  .

this tv has an excellent picture  .

i also have a 50inch panasonic plasma in the living room and i can say that the vizio's picture is just as good  .

standard definition is a little weak compared to other flat panel sets i've seen but i bought this to watch high def and nothing else  .

the price of this tv cannot be beat  .

paid $599 fro circuit city , good thing too the price just went up  .

its true what everyone says the sound for the tv isnt the best but if you adjust the settings properly then you can gain a good , crisp sound  .

not great but good  .

also have an xbox 360 , high def games look excellent  .

tv is a great buy with a great price .

bought this tv 6 months ago and receintly installed verizon fios and the picture is excellent  .

in fact , it's not that much better in high definition  .

now , i'm no expert on hdtv's per se but i know electronics from all angles as a former consumer electronics industry exec and as an avid user  .

and i watch a lot of tv  .

this model is the perfect combination of quality and price point  .

what you give up in so    so standard def  .

performance and a remote that still infuriates me after five days , you get back in a really fine hd picture , good built    in , and flexibility to make the adjustments you need  .

and for less than $600 for 32 at sams club incredible  .

figure that you'll want to switch to an 1080p television within a few years , and there will be far better all    around functionality in hdtvs by that time (that's where my ce industry experience kicks in)  .

you will move on from this unit , which will have cost you $200    $300 a year minus whatever you will get by selling it on e    bay  .

besides , if you are an hdtv late bloomer like me , you'll probably want a larger screen by that time , since most people underestimate screen size in their first purchase one thing i like about this vizio is that , for a ridiculous price , you have all the controls a videophile needs to get the picture and sound  you want   .

sure , there are some nits on sound (it will not auto    adjust , built    in speakers are average) , but wow          this baby has some great qualities for the price  .

i hear it has an lg oem screen , and i'm not surprised          a great hd picture  .

there is still a lot of sd signal in today's world so the fact the it is only tolerable in sd mode could be this unit's biggest weakness  .

but hey          spring for directtv or hd cable and you'll find all the major networks have hd versions of their channels  .

you will only have to suffer through old b w movies and game shows on tv land if that is how you roll i sit 5 feet away from my tv , and i'm really happy that i went with 32 instead of higher end 26 /27 hdtvs at this same price and higher  .

i recommend you get this part right , because if you like to sit close , any imperfections will be more noticeable  .

for how i view this vizio , i'm pleasantly surprised  .

i had expected much worse ok , now about he remote  .

it has no backlighted keys ; volume is on the right , which causes a lot of misfires if you're right handed ; everytime i pick it up and think it is right    side up , it is actually upside down , so i have a real orientation problem with it's ergonomic design ; and the keys are not well    positioned for how most people use the various functions on a remote  .

if you're like me , you've used maybe 50+ different remotes in your life  .

this is not one of the better designed ones  .

i will eventually learn to cope with it's deficiencies , but the irony is that everything else about the design of this tv is perfectly conceived except the remote  .

maybe if you're left    handed it is better bottom line   if you are analytical and study everything up the ying    yang like i do , save yourself a lot of effort and get down to you store of choice and just buy this one  .

in a few years , trade it in for the next generation  .

better yet , go buy two vizios like i did (32 and 42 )  .

read my review of he 42 inch in a few weeks over on that user review site  .

that baby is a winner too .

this tv is an excellent value for the money  .

with digital cable , it provides a clear , quality picture (even without hd) my only complaints are that there is a slight vertical line of brightening on the right side of the screen  .

(this may be limited to my tv and it might be due to interference from the cable box  .

) and , i do not understand why vizio cheaped out on the remote for the 32 tv  .

without backlighting , finding buttons at night in a dark room can be a pain  .

but , neither of these issues are annoying enough to do anything about i would highly recommend this tv    i got mine at costco .

just purchased the vx32l for $599 at circuit city , minus 10% aaa discount as well  .

also found it for $597 at wal    mart , or $592 at sam's club great picture and sound  .

easy setup , no dead/bright pixtels  .

i just plugged in my hdmi cable from directtv box and that is it  .

i am very happy with it comes with a one year warranty  .

i added a 2 year in home extension for $79 the only problem i have found is it has no standard mini headphone jack  .

for a bedroom tv that might be important  .

if you buy an rca    to    mini stereo adapter and have headphones with a volume control , you can get around it using the external audio out jacks on the far right the picture compares favorably to my $3200 56 jvc jim  .

overall this tv is amazing for the price , excellent picture quality  .

i do not even have digital cable but with the qam tuner i is able to pickup hd channels for free  .

awesome feature  .

the slick black look is awesome , this guy on cnet is crazy for bashing the look of the tv , it looks excellent also why is half his review on the appearance  .

it's about picture quality and amazing amount of features for the price , i think the vizio is a great deal and a very good 32 tv  .

awesome tv for the bedroom (although we had it in the family room for a few weeks before getting the 47 1080p lcd and it did the job just fine  .

the tv looks very nice , not sure why katzmeir bags it in his review  .

gloss black frame and silver base look great , and the angles in the speakers only improve the look       otherwise it would look like every other plain    jane unit on the market inputs abound as always and 720p hd looks pretty good when seated at the right distance , like any other tv  .

i'm a vizio believer all the way considering the price and white glove warranty service they provide if you run into a problem  .

unless you are a true audio/vidiophile , this stuff is way more than sufficient  .

i had the money to get a sony and still went with vizio (and got a dvd player , cables and everything else in my shopping cart at sam's and still saved money compared to buying sony)  .

go figure .

i have only owned this tv for four days so far and i am waiting for the cable company to upgrade my box from digital to hdtv  .

i think they are coming tomorow  .

but in the mean time i am getting the best picture that i have ever got with just a digital box  .

it compleatly blew away my two 27 inch sony wega sets which are only a year old that are hooked up to the same digital boxes , and i always thought they had a pretty good picture  .

and the owners manual is superb , filled with color pictures , so easy to quote a geico comercial so easy a cave man can do it i bought the set at sams club for $599  .

00 i could have got it on line at two diferent places delivered for $491  .

00 total , but they were refurbished and only came with a 3 month warranty  .

so i desided to pay the extra money and take it home the same night  .

and so far i'm a happy camper  .

and if the picture gets even better with the hdtv box then i am bying a second set immediately for the bedroom .

excellent tv for the money , the hd feature is great , it makes a big difference when your watching a dvd  .

the picture is amazingly clear tip   use the optical output for dts sound if you have a soundround systems , it will blow you away  .

great stuff i am happy with my purchase , i wish i've had chosen the 37inch though  .

we were amazed by the price and all the excellent features  .

two weeks before we purchased a 40 samsung lcd  .

for the proce of the samsung we could have purchased three of the vizio  .

excellent product .

last summer i bought a $799 westinghouse from best buy and have had bad picture problems and the speaker is already buzzing  .

i bought this vizio over the holidays for only $699 and it a world apart from the westinghouse  .

the picture is very good for normal use and have had no issues with the sound .

the picture is beyond reproach , the number of plug    ins and whatever their called is great , i have my digital cabel w/ hd hooked up , along with my macbook , and xbox360  .

(i paid 80 bucks for all season of the mlb  .

com package , and routed the games from my computer to my 32inch hdtv and saved the 300 dollars it would have costed if i stayed with dish) overall it serves absolutely every need and want i have , and for 599  .

00 you will not find anything better  .

perfect for hi    def gaming/tv and a killer price  .

one suggestion   upgrade the audio , its a bit weak by itself , but you can get a 5  1 kit out of the box at best buy for 250 bucks that sets it off wonderfully  .

totally satisfied  .

i bought this tv a few weeks ago  .

the vizio is not my first hdtv (1st is a maxent) and defiantly not the first encounter with an hdtv  .

first off i am a very particular person , my wife says that i am way too picky but hey if your going to drop money on a product you want to get what you feel that you paid for and the vizio vx32l delivers  .

i got the tv for the bedroom to watch movies at night with my wife and every now and then play xbox 360  .

i have to be honest when i first got the tv all set up i is not all that impressed (the standard settings are less than ideal , not bad but could be better)  .

i spent some time reading cnet , avsforum , thx optimizer and other info for recommended tv settings and finally found what looked good to my eye  .

the picture is clear when receiving an hd signal , looks phenomenal on the xbox 360 and hd dvd movies  .

watching the tonight show , csi , and 24 in hd look awesome  .

the standard definition cable signals are not that great , and some are better than others  .

for all the vizio offers it defiantly holds its own with the big names like sony , samsung and all the others  .

my father has a samsung 67 in plazma with 1080p , and my friend has a samsung 71 dlp 1080p and in my opinion did not see that much of a difference in picture quality , at least not for what you pay ($699)  .

one thing that is interesting is the tv accepts a 1080p signal , its not a 1080p resolution tv (max res   1366 x 768 which is a little better than 720p) the tv downscales the signal to its maximum resolution  .

which some hdtvs dont do this  .

i spent a long time trying out each of the xbox 360 settings and must say that the 720p looks good , the 1080i looks good , but the 1080p looks much better to my eye  .

the images are less pixilated and much clearer at that signal  .

( probably easier to scale 1080p down to 1366 x 768 than scaling 720p up to the 1366 x 768 resolution)  .

i wont lie there are many other tvs that are better but not for what you pay  .

defiantly i would recommend this tv to anyone looking for a tv this size .

the vizio vx 32 l is fantastic and a great economical tv w/features other tvs have at half the cost  .

i purchased this tv 1/2007 , because i is so impressed by its style and feature seen in my local costco  .

the price $699 , is a steal  .

the picture ; true and honest  .

im not technical , but my eyes do not lie  .

if you are cautious because you have not heard of the company , put your fears to rest ; vizio is 1st class  .

the warranty is fantastic also (1yr in house    parts    labor/not that you will need it  .

) the sleek style and fit anywhere you want it status  .

i recommend this tv for all hdtv subscribers  .

it is also easy to set up and programs as soon as turned on  .

all i can say is fantastic  .

i just got this tv from costco for 699  .

99 , after doing research on higher names brand electronics , the vizio vx32l comes better built than any of them this tv has 2 (yes 2) hdmi ports the playstation 3 is phenomenal with the hdmi , my also have a dvd player on hdmi which the video is awesome this is a good guy , work the 699  .

other than the wording being too small to see from a distance in the menu function the unit itself is wonderful and easy to use , not complicated at all  .

very good color and so many adjustments to make the tv just the way you want it .

i got mine for $450 when the same type of tvs cost around $700 , so i'd say its a great buy  .

vizio is not as popular of brand line samsung or sony , so your not paying as much , just for the brand .

i'm considering replacing a set in the family room and would consider a larger vizio as well .

got it for s bout $550  .

not bad for 32in hanging on the wall of my bedroom  .

works well for my uses  .

bright , good black levels , contrast higher than similar priced tvs  .

speakers kinda suck though .

i think this tv is great for the price it gives an overall good picture and looks great if hooked up to a gaming system like the xbox 360  .

i've had this tv for about 10mos and i havent had any problems with it .

had this tv for a few months now and it is still working and looking great  .

i went to buy a sony at circuit city , but when i saw this bright and clear picture right next to the sony for several hundred less , i jumped at it  .

i do not regret my decision one bit    it looks great hooked up to my comcast hd as well as my imac  .

my only gripe is that it has a vga input for pc rather than a dvi ; this is usual for lcds , but a guy can wish , cannot he  .

finally , the customer service is excellent .

for all of you that bought this tv , i would highly reccomend turning the brightness down on these units  .

they come factory preset to a very high brightness , it also puts a strain on the power supply (maybe why many of you have had problems)  .

i think if you do this , this set should last a long time  .

also on the pc input if anyone can figure out how to make it clear let me know because even set to the proper resolution it is not clear enough to use as a monitor  .

still pretty good though all things considered .

we bought this tv some months back , and i do not regret it one bit  .

it does everything that we want and i feel that differences between this and an expensive product is clearly offset by the fact that i can spend my savings on the surround sound system that i want and still sock some away for that big expensive lcd that i will get when we want/need it  .

everyone has mentioned the obvious issues with picture quality (relative) and the speakers (duh    get a surround system)  .

but overall , i remain well pleased .

not bad for a set that costs less than $600  .

used in the bedroom as a back    up tv , this flat panel presents a very natural looking picture after putzing around with the picture controls a tad  .

satellite hdtv and upconverted dvds both deliver good performance with natural flesh tones and good color saturation (both on hdmi inputs)  .

my sony bravia 52 in the living room beats it to smitherines , buy hey    it costs four times as much  .

off    axis the tv washes out quickly i'm a real stickler for good sound , and so will have to get this set's audio pumped up sooner or later    the built in speakers sound dreadful to me  .

the sound setup has a surround sound feature that i cannot hear , mayber someone else can overall though , i am quite satisfied  .

you get what you pay for , in this televisions case maybe a bit more .

you are hard pressed to find a better price point with this picture quality  .

everything looks very good at a distance  .

motion blur is not very bad for lcd  .

hd looks great , even up close  .

the panorama setting for viewing is just terrible  .

the center is not stretched at all , but the sides are so pulled it is difficult to watch anything on this setting sound is okay , but i can live with it  .

maybe down the line we will add a 5  .

1 system to clear up that limitation very happy with our vizio .

my father bought a jvc which is so blurred and had so little available in the rgb and contrast menu that we couldn't make it look any better  .

so we returned it right away and got him a samsung  .

the samsung is incredible in every way  .

it is pretty much perfect  .

the vizio 32in is the tv i just bought for myself after lots of research and lots of digging  .

i honestly have to say that the only thing that the samsung has up on the vizio is the swivel stand , much nicer remote , and the gloss black all over  .

there is little to no difference in the picture quality  .

if i did not like the vizio i'd just return it and upgrade , but it's great so why bother .

i bought the vizio vx32l as a second tv for my bedroom and to double as a pc monitor  .

for the money it has good picture quality and lots of outputs in the back and side of the panel  .

also , i love the picture    on    picture feature that allows me to work on my pc and see live tv at the same time  .

if you are looking for a good lcd tv at a good price this is it  .

this is my first hdtv  .

i did not want one yet , but my old tube tv died  .

we still have standard definition (sd) cable and will stay that way until hd is required  .

therefore , it is important to us that the sd programming look good as well  .

i'm very pleased with the picture the tuner is so good that it picks up hd channels that i'm not expecting to receive with my sd cable package  .

i've enjoyed watching college football in hd this fall  .

the color is not so good out of the box  .

the presets that are programmed into the tv do not improve things either  .

however , there is a very simple solution that most novices can handle  .

look through your dvd collections until you find one that has the thx optimizer included as a feature (i have it on my terminator 2 dvd)  .

use this to dial in the correct colors (it's self    explanatory)  .

once this is done , the picture looks amazing  .

finally , the price  .

i is able to find this brand new (not refurbished) at sears for less than $500 after incentives and discounts  .

we've had it for one month now and are very satisfied  .

vizio is an american company located in california  .

hopefully their longterm quality will impress me as much as their product does right now  .

we're hoping to get 10 years out of it  .

great lcd tv  .

if you are looking for hd , you can but this tv if your wallet is kinda dusty  .

sound is however , craptastic  .

it's not bad , it's just iffy .

this is my first hdtv tv , but it its definitely not the first one that i have examined or looked at while i is researching to buy a new tv set  .

this tv simply cannot be beat for the price , its picture is crisp , clear with great colors and should satisfy anyone whos looking to buy an hd lcd in this price range  .

i use it to watch dvds and play xbox 360 and im amazed at the quality of the picture  .

also the hdtv tuner picks up some off    air hdtv channels and that picture looks great also  .

i would say out of all of the screens which i have seen (those in the much higher price ranges) i would say that this one definitely stands up to the much more expensive systems and definitely distinguishes itself by offering tremendous connectivity options , great performance and an amazing price  .

the only downers i have about the set is the funky design (not a big deal , some may love it) the sound which is good but not great (maybe it's just me since i am an audio freak) and the fact that you have to be directly in front of the set to get the best picture , without wash out and quality loss but then again whos going to sit down in front of a 32 inch screen with 40 friends who have to sit at a weird angle  .

overall if your in this price range and want a quality set stop thinking about it and pick it up you wont regret it  .

vizio makes excellent products , im staying with them from now on  .

i picked up a vx32l for my home office  .

it looks fantastic hanging on the wall , gives me more than adequate sound in an 11x11 room , and does a good job of displaying sports the dark levels could be better , but this is a budget tv , so i do not expect the world from it overall i'm very pleased  .

i bought this t  .

off ebay and at first i had a few problems because it is a refurbished tv  .

vizio took care of the problem and now the t  .

v works great  .

watching this t  .

on regular cable is ok , but if you really want it to shine upgrade to hd cable the picture is amazing  .

for best picture you have to have a source of 480p , 720p or 1080i  .

480i regular signal do not look as great .

this is my second hdtv , my first is a samsung lnr 23 hdtv both are lcd sets , and this one for the moment and for the price has surpased the samsung model by far my first lcd just crashed suddenly one day without warning , something supposedly burned inide of it and now it's in my graveyard of old tvs , and since it cost 500 dlls it's not worth fixing because the parts are much more expensive the vizio has very solid quality , my directv looks much clearer on this set , altough i did have some trouble adjusting the contrast and colors at first blu ray movies on my ps3 look awesome and also my xbox 360 looks great , and for the price 597 dlls at costco  .

it is great .

i absolutely love this tv  .

i have my playstation 3 hooked up and it just looks fantastic    even regular dvd's  .

the picture is crisp and bright , no dead pixels , and blends in nicely with my room  .

however , the speakers leave something to be desired but they still get the job done nicely    warning   if you want hd sound you're not going to get it from these speakers , you will need to get some external ones     .

all in all , this is a great tv and the price just makes it a must    buy  .

i would definetly buy it again i'm giving it an 8 because of the sound    but apart from that it would be a 9 (10 should be reserved for the 108'' 1080p tv's)  .

i just purchased this set about a week ago and have been impressed from the get    go  .

i am still waiting on hd programming from directv , but the simple composite hookups (red , yellow , white) are giving me a superb picture  .

up close you can see image distortion , since it is only 480i , but from my couch it looks great  .

for sdtv , i is very impressed  .

i is a bit dissapointed with my hdmi hookup of my upconvert dvd player , but after some image tweaking , which is very extensive , i is able to get a picture that blew me away  .

cool thing is that each input will save the image settings  .

there is a custom picture setting that will save for each one , so you don't need to change it from movies to tv and back  .

very nice  .

the image presets are a bit off , so i don't use them i really rate the set at 8  .

5 , with the only problems coming from the sound  .

however , after turning off the surround sound (for the set speakers) and turning up the bass , it sounded much better overall a good set  .

out of the box it is merely decent , around 6 or 7 , but with some tweaking it becomes superb  .

the menus have many options , and you will not be dissapointed once you get it where you want  .

i also think it looks great  .

it got a lower review because the reviewer (on cnet) didn't like the way the speakers in the front look , but it doesn't take away from the general look and feel of the set  .

should have got around 7  .

2 , but because he did not like the design lastly , get the set  .

i compared some in the same price range , and this is the best  .

my only regret is not getting the 37  .

but , since my room is small , the tv looks great , and the picture quality is outstanding  .

i cannot wait for hd programming  .

on a whim i fed this set an unconverted pal signal from my oppo dv    970hd and is surprised to find that it worked great  .

the set is clearly not internally converting to ntsc but is in fact a true multistandard monitor .

got this at sears over the weekend , they had it priced at $599 , but on sale for $549  .

wife works at sears , and they had a special discount going on , end result $549    20%    great deal on a fine tv  .

it is as good as a sharp aquos  .

probably not , but for the price , you can get 2  .

literally .

i'm amazed at just how well this 32 bargain lcd performs  .

to get the amount of features and inputs this lcd has , you'd have to spend $200    $300 more on other brands the picture quality is excellent  .

i've seen this side    by    side with a sony , and i actually prefer the vizio  .

in fact , the picture quality is even better than my 30 sony hdtv (one of the 150lb crt monsters)  .

there are plenty of sliders to fine tune the color to your liking the remote control is a little annoying  .

it may be the only remote in the world that has chan up/down on the left and vol up/down on the right the built    in digital tuner means it automatically detects hd signals from your cable company , so you do not need a cable box to decode network hd channels excellent product all around  .

in order to get a better picture , i think you'd need to spend another $1000 on a 1080p television .

this is my first hdtv  .

this company is recomended to me by a good friend  .

who also owns the tv  .

i saw the tv in costco and loved the picture .

you cannot go wrong with this tv for the price you're paying  .

its a decent first time hd tv for someone that is not in love with brand names .

the old tube 27 finally died and had to find a replacement t  .

to fit my entertainment center that cost me a pretty penny a few years ago  .

i priced and researched and couldn't find a better value  .

i picked this up at sam's club for $599  .

00 only problem is they couldn't keep it in stock  .

that with the high reviews sold me  .

the limited high def broadcasts and ever changing technology prevented me from spending a ton of money on this television i have a 48 high def mitsubishi rear projection in the basement so i am familiar with the high definition movement  .

that being said the standard digital signal is mediocre at best as with all hdtv s due to the technology  .

the high definition signal is great and the up converted dvd player with hdmi cable looks super if you do not want to break the bank for this fairly new technology buy this television  .

for $599  .

00 you wont be disappointed  .

costco reduced the price by $100 for this the vizio 37 tv  .

this is a real steal at this price  .

the picture is fine out of the box , and it improves with adjustments  .

using a cheapo $14  .

00 radio shack picture frame antenna , i is able to pick up over a dozen hd channels  .

the remote is ergonomic has a nice traction feel on the back this is an excellent first hdtv set for those on a budget  .

sony will give you a better picture but the price is almost double this  .

i got this tv recently from costco , and i totally love it  .

i also found their (vizio's) website to be very helpful , and customer oriented .

av2 (tivo is hooked to) and tv input (regular tv) , are so far the ones we are having problems with  .

normally we use av2 to watch tv as this is connected to our tivo , thats where the problem started  .

when we turn off the tv it goes away , but eventually comes back  .

we have reset the tivo , unplugged the tivo , unplugged the dvd player , unplugged the tv , even unplugged all sources to try and figure out where the problems is  .

it seems to be in the tv itself as it still appeared with nothing hooked to the tv  .

are there any other consumers having this problem  .

is there a recall for this tv  .

any help would be appreciated  .

the tv is only about 4 1/2 months old .

i bought this tv over the weekend and as soon as i got a chance it hooked it up in my room along with a brand spankin' new ps3  .

the picture is awesome  .

it is one the best game playing experinces i have had the next day i had the directv guy come over to install an hd dvr  .

we went thru the channels and i have to say at first i was not impressed , but then i realized that the channels we were surfing thru were non hd channels  .

i finally went to showtime hd and saw the movie the four brothers and i have to tell you that the picture is awesome  .

i saw ever pour and sweat of peoples faces  .

the colors were vibrant and the screen didn't look bad at all with the lights off  .

i have read in other places that plasmas are better for lights out tv viewing , but it looks like no one told this tv that it should not look great with the lights off  .

just to tell you what i mean , i brought my wife tv shopping with me and all she kept on saying is i cannot tell the difference between hdtv and everything else  .

as soon as this movie started she finally gave in and told me that she finally saw the difference i did notice a little quirk  .

when i am watching tv i notice that the volume level goes up and down , but i don't mean the volume bar goes up and down just the volume it self  .

i am not sure if it is the tv or my directv hd dvr  .

i don't think i have noticed this issue while playing my ps3 bottom line this tv is money side note   for those directv customers who are trying to program their remote with vizio the code is 10056  .

i know directv has 3 different codes that usually do not work  .

i still have not figured out how to work the imput botton so if anyone out their knows something please share .

i purchased this tv today at sam's club for $688 i am very pleased with the picture quality all around , even the non    hd channels the 2 hdmi imputs are great for ps3 and directv receiver this is my first product review the reason i felt i would review this tv is because i returned a 32 hdtv and purchase this one  .

the one i had previously purchased is a viewsonic which had very similiar features but this tv is much better quality for about $100  .

more i have noticed a little bit of slow response time during faster action  .

anxious to test the playstation on it but have not done so yet this is my 2nd hdtv  .

my other is a 42 samsung plasma  .

the samsung is better but for the money this is a great value .

i bought this set after thanksgiving last year and debated whether to get this on or a sony  .

this set is to be used in the bedroom  .

the sony definitely had a better picuture and is more detailed , but it is almost twice the price  .

i bought the vizio and absolutely love it  .

i used digital video essentials dvd to adjust the pq and came very close to what cnet did  .

my backlight is adjusted a bit higher because it is not viewed in a completley dark room  .

cnet does not like the styling , i do  .

i like the black bezel , reminds me of pioneer elite styling  .

i also like the white vizio logo that changes to orange when off  .

some complain that it is distracting , i do not find it so  .

this is a great value for the money .

i've had this unit for a month  .

the black levels appeared too dark on mine right out of the box  .

however , this is easily corrected by turning off adaptive luminance this unit is a great value for the money .

i've been doing research on hdtvs for about a year now  .

i've read several reviews (from cnet and others) and watch the hdtv buyers guide video dl  .

tv put out several months ago  .

i felt i is a bit informed , but i just was not ready to spend $2000 on a new system i recently returned from an assignment in south korea and noticed that the furniture movers would not ship plasma tvs due to their fragile components  .

that got me thinking  .

i wanted to buy an hdtv in the near future and since i move around a lot , i better look into alternatives last december my wife and i purchased a digital projector with dlp technology and we totally love it  .

the problem is the hassel of setting up , taking down , and the fan at times can be noisy  .

we knew we'd eventually get an hdtv , but my wife wanted a brand name and i wanted to first upgrade one of our computers and turn it into the family entertainment center last week , while in costco shopping for some supplies , my wife and i saw this television and the price  .

$699  .

99 plus tax for a 32 lcd hdtv is a great bargin  .

what really cought our eyes were the pc input and hdmi tuner features  .

(try to find a brand name set with the same specs and i'm sure you'll spend at least $300  .

00 or more for the system  .

it's a great entry level set and we haven't been disappointed  .

we use it for video games , movies , computer use , and television viewing  .

some minor adjustments were made to get a better view of the computer screen and movies , but the instructions were easy to read and the onboard menu is simple to navigate  .

the only thing i'm having a hard time adjusting with is the layout of the remote , but with time i'll get the hang of it the only thing i wish the package included is a swival stand  .

it does come with a stand , but our set is on a desktop and if we had a swival stand , we would be able to move the set to angle appropriate for the number of viewers in the room  .

overall , we're very please with the system and do not regret our purchase  .

once last thing to remember   get digital or hd service if you want to use any hdtv  .

without the proper signal , the tv programs will not look very good on any hdtv overall , my family and i are happy with the purchase .

this is my first lcd tv  .

based on tons of research and reviews i narrowed it down to the sharp lc    32d43u and the vizio vx32l , and in the end i just could not justify the extra $300 for the sharp  .

i glad i went the way i did  .

because of my research on all brands , my expectations were very low for regular non    hd picture quility  .

wow , is that wrong  .

i am extremly pleased with the picture on both regular and hd programs  .

even dvds played on a $35 player thru regular composite cables is fantastic  .

my only complaint is that in the 3 of the 4 factory modes , standard , movie and game , the picture settings like tint , contrast etc are not adjustable  .

only in custom can you tailor them to your liking  .

i can see a button to reset them back to factory if you mess them up , but to not allow you to tweak them seems silly  .

that is the only reson i gave it an 8 rather than a 9 or 10 .

for my first hdtv i am very happy  .

i live about 30 to 35 miles from my local stations , but i can recieve 6 digital siginals with 13 seperate channels of programming with only some rabbit ears  .

the hd picture off the air is great and the sound is pretty good  .

cannot quite get the color right  .

i'm also trying to figure out if i can directly access the digital channels with the remote by punching in the channel number  .

i'm not sure what the digital number should be  .

football playoff's looked great  .

looking forward to nascar , baseball and the ncaa bb tournament  .

if this tv holds up , it gets my highest rating  .

i've only had it for 2 weeks so time will tell  .

btw dvd's look great too  .

i have the rabbit ears on one imput , cable box on another and dvd on a third  .

cannot wait to get a hd dvd player .

i bought this over thanksgiving at costco  .

i went there to buy the 32 inch panasonic lcd for $300 more , and the difference between the two was not enough so i took home the vizio  .

i saved $300 and i have zero regrets  .

if getting this size tv for your bedroom , this is your tv  .

i'm relatively hard to please and this works just fine for me i would recommend only sony over this in terms of overall picture quality , but go ahead and look at their price for a 32 inch lcd  .

the picture on the sony is the best , but not great enough to make you ignore vizio's price  .

get the vizio .

this is my first experiance in buying an lcd tv , i think i made a fairly decent choice  .

it's a great tv for the price  .

i like the dual hdmi hook ups  .

i've read alot of different reviews about this model and have found that some people have experienced malfunctions , i've had this set for over 6 months now and have had nothing go wrong yet  .

it seems to me that if you don't get one that's a lemon this is a great tv  .

also keep in mind that if you don't hook it up to an hd signal it does not look so great  .

that's one thing that i is unaware of .

this is not my first hd set so the i'm not blown out of the water by the picture like many other reviewers are simply because they finally see what hd can do  .

i bought this set for my bedroom so i did not need a home theatre performance  .

the picture quality is very good particularly for the price paid  .

the blacks are dark and rich but not as good as a comparable sony or toshiba but then again this set is 400 odd dollars less than those  .

the two hdmi ports and other imputs should keep all your equipment happy  .

the speakers do a decent job but you really need to use a reciever for big sound  .

the set does exactly what i need in a secondary role  .

my only really dislikes are that the vizio logo on the screen glows orange when turned off  .

it is a bit annoying as it is in my bedroom  .

the remote is cheaply built and feels flimsy but i , along with most others i would imagine , will be getting a universal remote  .

is the difference in quality versus the difference in price worth it  .

not really in the situation that i am using it for .

for the price , the vizio vx32l is great  .

i bought it recently since i wanted to upgrade to hd  .

i haven't been disappointed to this point  .

the picture is great , i tweaked the colors around a little bit , and it looks even better now  .

the sound is good , but i don't use it , since i use my bose 3    2    1 system  .

the design is a little funky  .

have not seen too much tvs that look like this , but it does stand out from the crowd  .

the two hdmi ports are nice , i use one for my ps3  .

when i play games , the quality is excellent  .

even though it cannot get up to 1080p , the quality still looks good  .

if you want a tv that has great picture and a great design , well vizio is not for you  .

but , if you want a tv that is priced to sell with good picture for that price range , this tv is for you  .

it's worked for me so far .

this is a second tv in our house and it works well  .

however , the first one we bought is defective (poor audio) so we returned it for another and have not had a problem since  .

the picture is good but not great (compared to my samsung)  .

if you have directv , you will have to search the forums for the code for your directv remote , but you can get it to work with the vizio , mine does  .

we are planning to buy another one this x    mas for our game room , so i do recommend this unit .

i've never owned another brand but sony and out of the box this set really impresses .

showed my dad who installs home audio and video systems , he liked it as a bedroom tv but is much more impressed with the gallevia 42 lcd i purchased also (see review)  .

nothing bad to say , it is a great tv , i love it in my bedroom , picure is excellent and the design is really good .

i bought this from sams club because of price and picture quality  .

the first one i brought home had an issue where the picture would not come on all the time  .

i figured you get what you pay for  .

so i went out and paid $300 more for a panasonic  .

i brought the panasonic home and thought it is a much worse picture then the vizio  .

i took the panasonic back to best buy and then took the vizio back and asked at sams if they get a lot of returns on these  .

they said no , so i decided to exchange it for the same model  .

i have had it a couple of weeks now with no issues  .

it has a great picture , easy to use menus , good for showing dvds and great for hd  .

it even shows sd tv better then some high end sets i have seen  .

the sound is not the best but an external reciever will solve that  .

hd hockey looks great but there is some blur in the fast moving , far away camera shots  .

overall i am really pleased for a tv at this price point  .

i would put these in every room in my house except my main media room  .

i did buy the extended warrenty from sams just in case .

this is my first lcd tv which replaced my 200lb 32 panasonic crt hdtv  .

the picture quality is good but being that i'm new to lcd's i must say that the picture quality on a crt is definitely better  .

the crt gave me more realistic skin tones and better white and blacks  .

however , when i did buy my crt i did pay more than what i paid for my lcd now and the picture quality is still better than most of the lcd's that i've seen in the stores , futhermore , the variety of input and output options are an asset buyers should know that this tv definitely looks best with an hd signal anything less and you will be severely disappointed with the picture quality  .

so if you are in the market for a new lcd with great looks and picture but do not want to break the bank , then definitely go with vizio  .

if you cannot settle for less than perfect you better be prepared to splurge .

we bought the vizio in july of '07 at sam's club for $599    got our hd cable converter , plugged it in , and instant hd  .

put in on the yankee's network and is simply amazed at the clarity of the picture (not so much by the yankee's that day)  .

at the time i didn't realize i needed to have an hdmi sound system , so i've been stuck with the tv speakers and the sound is not great  .

if you do not have the hdmi sound system be prepared for sound shortcomings    but if , like me , you can deal with non    theater sound you'll be very happy since the hd picture makes up for it  .

we have had no problems with the tv so i cannot respond to service complaints we do wish we had a bigger screen , but our existing cabinet determined the tv we bought so we just moved the couch closer (now about 12 feet away and fine)  .

all in all , for our first hdtv purchase i'm very happy while we wait for the big dogs to come down in price (and they will) .

i is looking for something simple , decent and not expensive  .

i paid $699 for this lcd at costco  .

i purchased this unit for my home gym , mounted it and have it hooked up to a directtv hd receiver via hdmi  .

it's been about a month now  .

the hd feed is good on this tv  .

nothing spectacular  .

but good  .

it is able to display in 1080i but sometimes  .

the green color looked too comic    like green for me  .

even with optimal settings applied  .

discovery hd\nat  .

geographic hd    were the best channels i've seen so far on dtv's programming line    up (which is very skimpy)  .

oh espn hd is also one of the best channels in hd  .

local hd channels are ok  .

the unit is also not as thick and heavy as other sets i researched the remote  .

ehh i think i'd like it better with a backlight but for the peanuts i paid for this set i cannot complain  .

the menu is pretty much simple overall , for the price i paid for this set , i'm happy with what i got  .

i'd be happier if the sd picture is a little better  .

but i should not be complaining  .

like i said earlier this unit is being used only during workouts in my home gym  .

i would not purchase this unit for a place like the family room (where it would be used more often)  .

it's a perfect set for the office , kids room , guest room or gym  .

for the family room , you would wanna get a much better set .

this is a good tv  .

the hi    def picture is good with some tweaking  .

the color in hi    def is good also  .

you cannot beat the price for budget minded people as we are  .

this is purchased for as a replacement tv for the bedroom  .

i wanted to move up to the hi    def as the clarity is much better than sdtv  .

the standard def is not great  .

i'll leave it at that  .

i'm waiting for directv to launch their 100 plus channels by the end of their 3rd quarter , then i think i will be more pleased  .

the downside to this tv is there is no soundlever which means you have to constantly adjust volume up or down depending on the channel you are watching  .

not a bad starter tv for those of us just entering the arena and testing the waters of hi    def tv  .

my next purchase will be for the living room and more than likely purchase a plasma or dlp  .

however , that wo not happen until my toshiba goes out .

the 32 vizio from costco replaces a smaller , non    hd rca tv  .

the tv is easy to install and connect all of the wires  .

the only confusion is programming the motorola hd box from time warner cable  .

for your basic cable channels (1    60       not hd and not digital) the rca picture is better  .

for digital cable and hd channels , the vizio is great  .

this concern may hold true for many of the 16  9 hd tvs , as a friends 50 pioneer had a pretty average picture when tuned to a basic cable channel .

i dont own this tv but i do sell them for a living  .

i recomend this tv for a second tv , for a kitchen or bedroom  .

it just does not proform well enough to make a very good main tv in a household  .

the color is a little washed out and the blacks are more of a gray , and the tv has an awful color scheme but the picture is suprizingly smooth and its cheap  .

my bigest reservation is that it is made by the lowest bidder and that means a great tv today could suck off the line tomarrow depending on who picks up the contract .

i work in an electronics department and see probably 4 out of 10 vizio 32in lcd's returned for various reasons  .

one reason that bothers me is the tv's failure to operate at all  .

the next in line would be the awful dim and sometimes discolored appearance that on    screen objects tend to take on  .

i recently saw vizio touting their new line of tv's at an electronics expo and became enthusiastic about a bargain brand that actually had potential as a good quality tv producer  .

as it seems to be with polaroid , protron/proscan , and sylvania you undoubtedly will get what you pay for if you spend roughly 50% less for a tv with 50% the quality  .

i see many different brands side    by    side everyday for at least 6 or 7 hours , and i have to be honest when i say that vizio does not hold a candle to the sony's and samsung's that are on the market  .

sorry bargain buyers , them's the breaks .

mine died after 7 days , however here is what you should know set up is easy , the tuner quickly scanned for digital and non    scrambled hd signals  .

the tuner does not allow you to select your cable system and it missed a lot of the locally available digital and hd channels lots of connection options on back of set sound and image is good , the remote rocked our optimal viewing seating is 12 feet from the tv , 32 screen is perfect  .

it fit our entertainment center so there is no need for new furniture however an almost $600 dollar tv should be better than average and last longer than a week .

my tv lasted 13 months the dmi plug is bad vizio seems to know the problem but all they can say is sorry we got your mula  .

kept having problems with hd channels    picture would be bounce around and have static  .

sometimes worked fine , and sometimes not  .

verizon came out and tried to find problem with their service    lines , box all replaced  .

i finally returned tv and got another brand    no problems now .

i purchased my vizio back in march  .

everything is okay until a week and half ago the tv would turn on but there is no video or audio  .

then i tried to turn it off and it stayed on  .

so call tech support and they is going to send a repair man in a week  .

he comes out and he replaces the power unit and still doesn't work  .

he informed me that vizio is also supposed to send him a motherboard but they did not  .

so i've got to wait another week for the motherboard  .

hopefully that will fix it .

purchased vizio 32 tv on august 6 , 2006    it died on august 10 , 2007  .

i called the vizio support desk ( held for 45 minutes)    their answer is its past the one year warranty    too bad    did not know vizio then but thought it is safe purchase at sams club    wish that i had bought another brand  .

if you buy this unit    get the extended warranty    otherwise you are screwed     .

so i bought the vizio 32 hdtv and is amazed at how cool it looked  .

however , after 1 hour of being turned on , a blue line appeared on one side of the screen  .

apparently a line of resolution had went out and the blue line never went away thus i returned the tv and purchased an lg for around the same price and so far so good it may have just been a bum tv i got but who knows .

have had the tv for about 2 weeks and it is already broke  .

got the tv home ; everything is fine  .

the picture quality is not that great  .

seen other similar tvs with better quality  .

about 4 days in ; got a hum from the speakers  .

hum is still there when tv put on mute  .

it is intermitten  .

then when put the tv under hdmi selection  .

no sound  .

also kept getting error messages saying the hdtv was not working  .

called the vizio company and after being on hold forever ; talked to a tech  .

they were rude as they couldn't figure out what is wrong with the tv  .

then they transferred me to another tech  .

hold time is 12    15 mins  .

and it is long distance call  .

they told me the hum on the tv is normal  .

brand new tvs are not suppose to hum at all  .

they could not figure out what the problem was  .

so i am taking it back and getting a better or name brand tv  .

purchased this television february 4th , 2007 for my master bedroom after buying a beautiful sony 46 inch for my family room  .

vizio in the bedroom got minimal use , maybe an hour in evening and/or morning  .

is working fine last night at bedtime but this morning the set would only turn on manually (yes the remote had batteries and is working well) but unfortunately the set would not turn off except for when you unplug it  .

when it is on there was not any picture or sound , couldn't even get the menu to come up  .

called vizio and they wanted me to unplug it for a while and try again but i had already done this  .

they offered to send a technician to my home to repair the tv  .

while i appreciated that they were very nice about it , something in me just tells me that a brand new television should not need a repairman after only one month of ownership manufacture date is just november 2006  .

so i've opted to return the set to the store if they'll allow me to return it after the 30 day point  .

if they wo not , i'm back to having it repaired i guess  .

in the meantime , the sony is working very well with absolutely no issues to date  .

price actually may make a difference .

i am very disappointed that the tv only lasted 2 years  .

we were so happy with our set we were planning on getting a new vizio for my mother in law for her birthday but now i think we will get her an lg instead  .

i expect a tv to last longer than 2 years with light usage (this is a second set in the bedroom that is used occasionally)  .

until this happened i is very happy with my vizio set .

should be removed from shelves nationwide  .

stick with the veterans  .

when i saw this vizio at a clearance sale for a great price i thought i is getting a great deal  .

unfortunately the screen is defective and started distorting  .

after an attempt at repair , they agreed to replace it  .

at first they wanted me to send the tv back and wait a couple of weeks for a replacement  .

when i wrote them and explained i wouldn't stand for that , they agreed to send a replacement first  .

now the replacement is broken and i'm waiting for the repair guy again  .

i feel doomed , like as soon as the warranty is up i'm going to have to just throw this thing in the garbage so do not buy this if you see it up on craigs list after it gets repaired  .

i'm done with this no frills crap  .

i wanted an lcd because i heard they last long  .

just not vizio i guess .

my vizio 32 lcd tv looked good out of the box  .

on the 93rd day it failed  .

it took three weeks of hoop jumping with vizio service to get anywhere  .

(they lost the file twice , lost the pics of the faulty screen they had me send , did not return calls and otherwise did everything possible to make me go away  .

) finally , they admitted that the tv is defective    duh    and then said i would have to ship it back to them at my (considerable) expense so that i would eventually be sent a replacement  .

buyer beware .

this is a christmas present from my husband and in january we began to have problems with a red bleed    through on all dark areas  .

after many phone calls and our doing their suggested fixes , they had to send out an onsite tech to replace parts  .

after a week problem continued  .

vizio wanted me to send them my tv at my expense and then they would send me a reconditioned replacement  .

after many phone calls they finally agreed to send a new replacement tv with a pre    paid mailing label  .

long story short    replacement tv (reconditioned , not new) doesn't work either  .

either won't come on at all or wo not stay on  .

spent over 2 hrs on the phone with customer service last night  .

supposed to send us a new tv  .

we'll see  .

will never buy another vizio product .

bought the vx32l in october 2007 , worked great for about 2 months , then had purple spots appear in white colors and bright spots (like when light reflects off a shiny object)  .

posted the issue on vizio's discussion board , but it's not there (they review prior to posting  .

nothing offensive is said)  .

called tech support , who had me unplug unit for 3 minutes , which solved issue , for 2 weeks  .

contacted support again , tv is unplugged again , but this time problem is not resovled  .

they said they would schedule service , which would take 7    10 business days (  .

) for them to contact us to schedule when they could come out  .

this is a major purchase for our family , and now we will be without access to tv for at least 2 weeks  .

i did not think about it then , but i wonder if vizio will pay for a pro    rated portion of our cable bill since we cannot watch anything until it's repaired will update after the repair .

do yourself a favor and buy anything but a vizio  .

purchased on 7/13/06 and on 9/27/07 it caught on fire yes you are reading this right  .

it caught on fire  .

thank goodness my wife and i were both at home and i is able to put the fire out very quickly  .

talked with level 2 tech assistance    they had a guy come out said   yep , looks like the power supply burned up  .

vizo is going to ship a power supply tuesday , a week ago , and they said they would send it overnight  .

i have yet to see it  .

why bother with sending a new power supply , the darn thing is toast anyway  .

dumb people  .

anyway , please do yourself a favor  .

if you have just bought one    quick take it back .

getting through to customer service requires 45+ minutes on hold  .

getting tv repaired requires several week delay  .

then repairs do not work buy something else .

great price point and could not beat the picture , but when it died after 31 days i is reminded why you should buy a name brand and trusted mainstay i spent extra and went sony .

the tv itself is nothing great , in terms of quality  .

however , if they weren't so useless in terms of customer service , the below    average quality would be made up for by the below    average price  .

however , they have the worst customer service ever  .

check out this story    .

i ordered from them in mid    march  .

they shipped it fedex , pretty late  .

had to take the day off from work to take delivery  .

so far , ok , if annoying  .

then , because of their crappy packaging material , the tv is broken on delivery  .

now the nightmare starts in full   it took me at least 3    4 calls to find someone who could figure out what to do for me to get a replacement  .

their people are not the brightest , to say the least  .

then they started calling me   why are we sending you a new tv  .

we do not see you in our system where are you in our system (yeah  .

they kept demanding i tell them where i is in their system)  .

i tried to get them to tell me how to send back the old , broken tv  .

noone could tell with any certainty or clarity  .

one of their guys could barely speak english  .

but i is promised a return label in the package for the new tv and yet it got even worse   on the day the new one arrived , i had to take a day off from work again for this delivery  .

now ups had the unfortunate task of delivering for these idiots  .

of course , the return label is not provided as promised  .

at this point i'm so pissed off i can barely stand up straight  .

i've been on the phone with their rude nasty people at least a dozen times , each time being interrogated as to exactly where i is in their broken system  .

so after more calls , finally a manager calls me  .

and says someone will pick up the old broken tv that day  .

this is the first person at the company who seemed like she had a brain above the reptilian level  .

an actual human being  .

wow  .

at vizio the clicher   today , more than 10 days after i thought this nightmare is finally over (  .

) some cretin customer service manager named donovan or whatever (who had the nerve to tell me she did not have a supervisor or manager , apparently she thought i would believe she reported straight to the president    and he's in taiwan a lot she helpfully informed me    nice tidbit , huh  .

she begins to again interrogate me as to where i is in their system , and threatened me that they would charge my credit card for another tv , or repossess their old one , if i did not cooperate un    believable  .

just incredible  .

at this point , the modest savings of a couple of hundred bucks earned by buying vizio were more than outweighted by the lost time and aggravation do yourself a huge favor and do not deal with these clowns they have the worst customer service i have ever experienced .

if you are willing to buy vizio vx32l , the most import part of the purchase will be the return policy or warranty and extended warranty ,  .

i tried my best to buy it , in the event i exchanged 3 sets from costco and finally returned the 4th all of them had the same problems    .

1) backlight will buzz if its less than 89 2) sometime the backlight wont get triggered and you see no picture only the sound  .

when you switch on the tv  .

3) hd channels wont show up the first time , you need to surf and get back multipls times to get them hope you find this helpful and someday people from vizio gets to address this problems .

i bought this tv the 1st week it is available in november  .

i is really disapointed in the overall picture quality  .

i took it back and bought a samsung s3292d , wow what a difference in picture quality and overall styling  .

you get what you pay for .

do not purchase a vizio at any price  .

it will not last  .

they gave me the hardest time i had in my life customers service  .

terrible i cant find my reciept because who ever would expect for a television to last a year , they got it on record  .

i got the box it came in and everything  .

now i dont have a job and and cant afford another television  .

when i first got it my boss and friends is laughing at me saying u get what u pay for  .

i dont believe that but they is right  .

i have pictures of my television for anyone to see  .

i would never recommend this brand to anyone  .

stay with a more reputable company who will stand behind their product and not say that it is too bad that a major part of the tv only lasted two years .

this is not an inexpensive tv  .

this is a cheap tv  .

do yourself a favor and stay away  .

it is guaranteed to fail (perhaps repeatedly)  .

i've yet to meet anyone who has had one of these go for more than 3 years without a failure  .

mine failed twice in 18 months    naturally the second failure is 30 days out of warranty  .

oh and vizio will scold you for not buying the extended warranty rather than apologize for a crappy product  .

of course getting the extended warranty will make no difference  .

this is not one of those products that might fail  .

in my experience , it will do so repeatedly , so fixing it is just buying you another 6 months to a year .

extremely disappointed with the performance of this tv  .

within a few months of buying it , i start seeing hundreds of green pixels all over the screen and a lot of horizontal streaking  .

one can barely read anything off the tv  .

called vizio and they asked me to send them pictures of the defect and the whole tv , something i have never heard of before  .

anyways , they decide to replace it , but i have to pay shipping  .

almost $200 for a $600 tv  .

go figure it out  .

it's better to spend that $200 and go with sony , samsung or one of the better companies out there .

i will never , ever buy a vizio product again  .

not only are their products mediocre , but the customer service at vizio is worse than terrible  .

i purchased a vx32l at costco in dec 2007  .

after a few weeks of using the unit , a 4 vertical green stripe began to appear on the screen  .

i called the costco concierge service (which , by the way , is awesome)who contacted vizio  .

vizio , at first , refused to replace the tv claiming that i had damaged the set  .

after some choice words and escalating it to a level 3 (  .

) status , vizio finally agreed to send me a replacement tv  .

after 3 weeks , the replacement tv arrived , which is also damaged  .

after 5 minutes of use , the screen would scramble and freeze and a loud popping noise would come from the speakers (i thought it is going to blow up)  .

so , after contacting vizio (via the costco consierge services) yet again , they agreed to send me a second replacement unit  .

after 3 weeks and no replacement tv , i contacted vizio again for follow up  .

their promise is that they would express ship a unit to me  .

after another week , no replacement  .

another call to vizio and i come to find out that they screwed up the work order , yet no one ever bothered to follow up on it  .

the promise now is that i should be receiving a new tv within a week (i think i have heard that one before)  .

this process has taken over 4 months and is still not resolved  .

take my advice , pay the extra $$ for a sony or panasonic for a better quality product and hopefully better customer service .

i bought a vizio 32xl for my mother    in    law at costco  .

it had a picture comparable to a sharp 32 lcd that cost well over $100 more  .

after a month , she told me she is having audio problems  .

she is electronically challenged , so i is somewhat sceptical  .

she lives 100 miles away , so , i bought another one , tried it out at my house , and drove down to her house , expecting to replace the one she had with the new one  .

the orginal vizio did , in fact , have very annoying intermittent problems with the surround sound , so i packed it up , and hooked up the new one  .

it is operating for a day , when it started to shut off  .

i unplugged it , hooked it up where another tv is working fine , and it would not even turn on  .

i am on my way to return both of them , and buy the sharp  .

there are many negative comments on the internet about vizio's lack or response to customer complaints , and poor service  .

it is only because of costco's 90 day return policy that i decided to take a chance on them .

vizio is a company who makes cheap tv's and you get what you pay for  .

the viewing angle is under parr of other tv's in the same price range  .

the colors and the sharpness that the tv gives you are blurry and inaccurate and will leave you wanting more  .

tv's are a big investment and it would be best to sacrifice size for picture quality or save for a couple more months and buy something you really like  .

the difference between this tv and a good tv is usually only a couple hundred dollars  .

here are some tv models in the size that i would recommend having actually been a tv salesman who had to stare at all these tv's all day samsung lnt    3242h  .

sony kdl32s3000  .

panasonic tc32lx70  .
