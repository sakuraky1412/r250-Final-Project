i have stayed at this property perhaps 3-4 times in as many years .
since i am hilton hhonors gold i was up graded to a 1 bedroom suite on the 24th floor with club access privileges on 16 .
suite has more basic living room furnishings with a double door to the bedroom with a very comfortable king bed .
couples staying there will enjoy the 2 bathrooms , one in the bedroom and one off the living room .
ample closet space and generous hilton toiletries .
friendly and efficient front desk staff giving us breakfast coupons ( if you are gold or diamond status with hilton ) and willingly gave us a late check out due to our flight schedule .
spectacular art deco lobby , lounge and restaurant , a cincinnati institution downtown , very close to good dining and saks next door .
sadly the area is very quiet at night , although since we stayed there during christmas , the skating rink next door seemed popular with locals .
high speed elevators make for a short wait .
my negative comments are few , the belvedere club lounge ( if you have access ) has a nice buffet breakfast in the a. m .
, with tasty snacks/drinks/cookies at cocktail time , although being a coffee addict i found the coffee there weak and tasteless , ( i go to a starbucks a few doors down from the hotel ) complimentary use of the full public gym/pool on the lower level , although the gym equipment . . .

i like the underground valet car service and found their automated pick up call fast and efficient .
high end hotels in downtown cincinnati are few and this is a good choice for price and hilton dependability.
