all i wanted from a camera is something with alot of zoom , and video    recording options , and what i got is a dream  .
this is my first major camera (coming out of a 2 mp point shoot camera that is 6 years old) , so i really , really , really researched all the top camera (as per cnet) and kept falling for this one  .
i got it in black (since everyone always gets the silver) , and i've have it since sept , 2009  .
it's an amazing camera with alot of zoom (its a wide    angle camera too) and although its main tag is that its a hd    recording camera , i am still having sooooo much fun with its zoom options , that i am hardly playing with its recording options as yet  .
its worth every cent , and unless the naysayers that say there aren't many manual options on the camera , i say 'its a point and shoot camera' so do not expect too many manual options but it still has quite a few  .
if you need more info , let me know i still keep getting compliments for it every where i go (even as late as last night)  .
after a long time of looking and trying out different models of cameras in this category the lumix dmc    zs3 is the best camera for the price  .
despite my issues in the cons section above , this is still the best camera i have owned  .
it is easy to use , takes great quality movies , the 12x zoom is nice to have and the wide angle is very nice for indoor shots  .
i do not even bother using my semi    pro canon anymore as this camera takes pictures just as good and can fit in my pocket .
i love this camera  .
it is so easy to use , point and shoot  .
you can even do a burst of pictures and pick the best one  .
i love the hd video and the fact that you can zoom during a video  .
there is a convenient video record button on back which is very handy  .
i also like the toggle switches for on/off and shoot/review  .
no more , press and hold and wondering if the camera is on or off or which mode you are in  .
i found the menu easy to navigate  .
with the exception of the macro functions , i did not need to consult the manual to learn the basics of this camera  .
i also have to say that the design is very cool , compact and i love the colors  .
mine is red  .
it's been a long time since a camera has wowed me , but this one did  .
nice job panasonic  .
this is a great camera for traveling light and still getting high quality pictures       all automatically  .
i consider myself an amateur photographer and love to take photos where i'm in control of all setting       i have a nikon d200  .
but there are times when i just want to do things other than photography  .
when i do stuff with the kids , i find this camera to be the perfect companion  .
just point and shoot  .
the camera even recognizes my kids faces when taking group shots , and it makes sure that my kids are correctly exposed and focused  .
it detects the scene where you may have a very light background with a person in the foreground and compensates to expose the person correctly  .
the other beauty is the wide angle and telephoto       and it's not digital telephoto , it's the real deal .
we used this camera on our 1st big summer vacation to jackson hole , wy and yellowstone national park  .
what better place to test a camera's quality then there  .
anti    shake worked super while on horseback and a river float trip , again , no better situation to test this feature  .
we had 2 digitals filming at the same time , the other without anti    shake and very obvious it did not have this feature  .
stills  .
we did not have 1 still that is blurry  .
not one  .
many with the other  .
the zoom while video taping is exceptional  .
the videos we took of bison , elk and the tetons were very nice  .
i made a 50 video movie with adobe premiere elements , the big issue here is the absolute hog of a computer you need to make a movie  .
it to forever to make the movie because my brand new hog hp laptop is not the top laptop on the mountain which you will need  .
6 to 8 gigs of ram , i have an amd turion x2 ultra dual    core mobile zm    86 chip set , not fast enough  .
make sure if you want to make movies , long ones with lots of transitions and other effects , that you also have a fast , current system and program that can handle the avchd format or you wo not be happy  .
great camera , and all we'll use from here out  .
my camera is still new so i may find out more about it that i want to share but at this point it couldnt be any better  .
i highly recommend this camera if you want a simple point and shoot that also produces quality photos and movies .
i spent many weeks reviewing cameras and came up with this one on top  .
i am very happy with it  .
i dont miss the manuel controls as i can use mu nickon slr any  .
time for that sooting but i have owned 10 digatal cameras and like this one the most  .
i would highly recomend this camera to any one .
tested camera against my canon 20d slr  .
tested camcorder against my sony hd camcorder  .
you would have to be a professional to figure which is better on both counts for a point and shoot , it cannot possibly get any better the software is also very simple , burning a hd dvd no problem (you need a dvd player that will play avchd , my 2 year old blu ray does so i'm sure most any will) or you can burn your video in sd format for any player (i have not checked this quality  .
i have a couple of thousand dollars worth of cameras i will be gladly setting on my shelf and replacing with this one in my pocket i ordered this camera for my father , when i got it i could not help testing it i am looking for one now for myself  .
i showed the pics and video to my brother he said order him one  .
i hope they pay me back .
i reccommend buying this camera or the newer model with the gps zoom quality    excelent  .
speed shot in both options is amazing  .
macro is very clear  .
hd video is very easy to use and clear , no time limits on length just remember use the same button to start and stop the video all the my scene options are wonderful , i have my favorites , but check them all out .
i first bought this camera in may '09 and is immediately impressed with every feature of it  .
i have not used or seen a camera that is capable of nicer pictures and video for the price  .
shortly after i got it , my wife tripped and fell while holding it and even though it is in a case the lcd is completely destroyed and all of the pictures that we'd taken that evening were somehow erased  .
i is so impressed with the camera overall , however , that i bought another one  .
fast forward to a few nights ago  .
i is outside taking pictures of a lightning storm    i went back inside and the camera accidentally slipped out of my hands but fell pretty softly about three feet onto a pair of shoes by our front door  .
from the sound and look of the fall , i is completely surprised to turn it on to see a horizontal line across the middle of the lcd display and no power to the bottom half  .
it didn't lose its pictures , but the flash function is now inoperative and many of the features are not able to be viewed on the screen  .
i tend to take good care of my stuff and keep things for a very long time , so i is pretty annoyed at myself for dropping it  .
but i had no doubts at first that there would be no damage from such a minor fall  .
i is proved wrong immediately and made to realize just how fragile this camera is  .
i am now considering buying a third dmc    zs3 , but based on it's frailty , i'm going to look at other manufacturer's offerings first  .
if anyone has a camera now with hd video and stereo recording (my favorite feature of the camera) for a comparable price , i'm probably going to buy it instead  .
i absolutely love this camera , but it really needs to be slightly more shock resistant  .
my two previous cameras were a canon a300 (2003) and a nikon coolpix l1 (2006) and neither of them ever broke  .
i'm still giving this camera 4  .
5/5 , because it's my fault that it broke , but i do not think any camera should break so easily .
when i first got this camera , i was not super impressed  .
my other two cameras were canons and they were wonderful  .
however , i have now taken this camera traveling all over europe and can say it is perfect  .
it's the perfect size , has great variability (wide angle and super zoom) , takes good video , relatively long battery life , and the photo quality is great , especially compared to my friends' cameras  .
the macro could be better , it does not let you get super close but it's good enough  .
the zoom can be extended by changing settings from 10 mp to 3 mp  .
i've done this plenty of times and the photo quality is still great  .
it's fast at zooming , switching between viewing and picture taking mode , and turning on  .
most of the time i just leave it in ia mode and it takes care of everything  .
love this camera  .
only side note , the hd video software did not work for me which is horrible because you cannot process the video with any other software  .
switched the video mode to wvga and it works just fine .
bets camera i ever had  .
terrific image quality in a package small enaough that you wo not hesitate to carry it along  .
a litlle heavier and bulkier than other point and shoot , but much less so than a slr  .
and you get the benefit of a 28 mm wide angle and 12x zoom  .
few manual overrides , but i found i never missed them .
excellent camera  .
a real hybrid no longer need to sacrifice in video quality  .
i pick this over lx    3 because i usually do not use the manual controls no matter how much i love to .
it contains more features than canons in it's price range and very good image quality  .
it looks sharp and will get people's attenton  .
a very good camera overall , especially if you want the flexibility of shooting on the spot hd video to capture a moment just by pushing a button  .
took to hawaii last year and is really neat to always have it handy  .
used a kata dp    407 case (barely fit , but had room for spare battery  .
) that fastened securely to belt cons   the purple flares that sometimes show up when taking pics of the sun , sunset , sunrise  .
you know it is happening because you see it on the lcd mode dial may move on you which can prevent you getting the shot you wanted , or no shot at all  .
it will only move when accidentally touching by removing from pocket or case , etc blurry video whem zooming pros   size , size , size and zoom , zoom , zoom fast , under 3 second start up , about 7 seconds to full zoom  .
oh , and good pics and great video (most of the time) .
for the price and flexibility , it is a win    win  .
it replaced a canon elph that died on me  .
although the canon is a step up from my previous olympus (megapixel    wise) , the canon just did not have the same quality as my old olymput due to the size of the lens  .
so , i wanted one with a large    ish lens  .
the lithium    ion rechargeable is also a big consideration as many of the others i is considering used only aa batteries and reviews showed that the battery life is very short  .
i'm hoping that after a while , i can get used to all of the settings and really enjoy using this camera , epecially the hd movies  .
i have 'regular' sd cards from my old cameras (2gb)  .
should be fine for regular shots/movies etc  .
but , not sure of what i would gain if i went to a sdhc card and what type  .
faster time between shots  .
faster burst  .
faster movies  .
better movies  .
so , spending a lot of time with the manual right now  .
hoping that i start understanding some of this stuff soon if anyone knows how to use time    lapse on this thing (not burst) , please reply  .
thanks  .
johnny  .
a great buy , easy to use with great pictures almost as a slr the video is great , you need a high gig memory card of course , (no card with camera) if your taking alot of video  .
portable , good for the money , zoom this camera is the way to go  .
with the leica lens , lumix is definitely moving up in the market .
this is the point and shoot to get if you want the highest zoom , great io features , in both still and moving pictures  .
wide angle lens and video compression that will allow you to record video until the memory is full  .
it will change settings to allow for the best video , changing for low light , indoors , outdoors  .
manually or automatically  .
a true hd camcorder and digicam in one  .
i thought the samsung hz15w / wb550 is going to be the one for me this year , but they have restricted recording times  .
this panasonic rules .
this camera is great for about 6 months , but it cannot take daily use and normal wear tear  .
if you cary it kicking around in your bag , the front of the lens system gets lots of dings , which cause the protective leaves to get jammed  .
also , the camera turns on too easily in the bag or in your pocket , causing the lens to extend in cramped quarters , which has ultimately led to the lens no longer being able to focus correctly this camera line can be a great alternative to a dslr , but panasonic needs to make it more robust .
i wanted to like this camera , but taking pics of people indoors is probably the chief chore of most point    and    shoots  .
this camera had difficulty with this task for some reason creating numerous pics of people with blurred outlines  .
the camera is in intellegent auto mode for all these pics  .
shipped it back after 5 days .
i used the camera for 2 months everyday during a trip  .
in that time i used 3 different sd cards by 2 different manufacturers  .
i experienced memory card errors on all 3 of them , which makes me believe it's the camera that caused the problems  .
one card went blank after a memory card error message appeared after taking a photo and none of the photos became viewable on the camera or when connected to a computer  .
the other deleted a whole days worth of photos and replaced it with empty black frames that could not be deleted from the camera  .
the third memory card also had a check memory card message and the camera froze    it would not shut off and the lens would not retract  .
i formatted the cards beforehand which is supposed to prevent the problem  .
but now i'm convinced that it may be the camera that's causing the problem  .
data recovery is not cheap and this has caused quite a headache trying to resolve  .
i will be in touch with panasonic and hopefully they will be able to help me .
just emailed panasonic (will see how they handle the complaint) will let you know  .
if anyone else noticing this    please let me know .
good camera , but i would not buy again  .
there are better cameras for the same price  .
no sports mode to speak of .
bought this camera because it had the potential to be a great combination of everything , with the assumption that indoor/low light performance is at least acceptable outdoors in medium to bright light , it's a great camera  .
the lens is incredibly flexible and everything works as advertised , except auto focus  .
auto focus is buggy at certain zoom levels towards the long end of the range , which can be very annoying sometimes , but otherwise the camera is reasonably quick  .
movie mode works well , albeit with caveats mentioned later  .
pictures are a bit over    sharpened but otherwise look nice  .
manual control is limited , but intelligent auto works well indoors , it's a constant battle to get anything to look decent  .
noise is present from low isos , and very quickly becomes intolerable , which is too bad , because you're forced to use higher isos or suffer severe motion blur  .
the lens that is so great outdoors becomes a liability indoors  .
the zoom is not of much use inside , and the lens is slow (f3  .
3 max aperture)  .
you can try to add light with the flash , and although this will usually result in a cleaner , non    blurry pic , it terribly upsets the white balance and creates horrendous hot spots on noses , foreheads , and eye wear  .
you can try backing away from the subject to soften the flash and zoom back in , but then you're walking a fine line between enough light to manage an acceptable shutter speed/iso and too little while still suffering some flash artifacts movie mode looks good if there is a lot of light  .
the formats available , however , are avchd    lite and motion jpeg  .
the former is an issue if you don't have a fast computer running windows , since you won't be able to play movies smoothly (vlc does horribly with this format)  .
motion jpegs play smoothly , but then a 16gb sd card suddenly seems tiny  .
overall , not as happy with the movie mode as i is with our previous canon camera , despite the fact that the zs3 can zoom while shooting and has hi    def so far one firmware update has been released  .
i is hoping it would address the autofocus problems at long zoom ranges , but instead the only thing it did is disable support for third    party batteries  .
that's too bad , because battery life is a weak point , and a 2nd battery would have been worth if it i was not forced to by an expensive panasonic battery also , be warned   this camera uses proprietary connectors for usb and video  .
i would have preferred if they had made the body slightly larger and used standardized connectors  .
we've already managed to lose our video cable , and now have no way to play back avchd videos smoothly except for in the camera itself bottom line   this camera tries to fit everyone's needs and makes a valiant attempt , but it falls so far short for indoor work that i'm already in the market for something to replace it (perhaps a canon s90)  .
using lower    res , higher    sensitivity sensor (6 mp would have been enough) in this camera would have probably resulted in the awesome all    around capabilities they were looking for , even if it would have lacked hi    def video i had hopes for the zs7 , but so far it looks like once again , they have not addressed the cameras weaknesses and have only added features that would only be useful if they had  .
in fact , it appears they've gone the opposite direction since they've even further upped the pixel count  .
that's disappointing .
should be a good one but till now not for me  .
not a fan of this camera  .
i spent half the afternoon trying to run a slide show from the camera for a relative who purchased one  .
in short , you cannot put pictures into a directory and then run a slideshow of only that directory  .
there is also no other reasonable mechanism to categorize pictures for the purpose of display  .
once a picture is copied off the camera it can not be copied back on (the file can be copied , but it is not recognized by the camera)  .
same for renaming pictures       once you rename them , they are no longer recognized by the camera although the image quality is excellent , the user interface is absolutely wretched , and the camera is not well suited to those who archive pictures/favorites on their dsc //dan  .
don't get it  .
i can guarantee you that it wo not even last you a year  .
well , if you are not picky about having all of the pictures you take , i guess this camera is ok  .
i am really bummed since i tried calling panasonic about this problem and they said i must have forgotten to format the card and that they had never heard of this problem  .
funny cause it happened to someone else who has this camera as well  .
maybe we are the only 2  .
it works great for a while and then all of a sudden just chunks of pictures cannot be read and cannot be uploaded and it says the files are corrupted  .
again , panasonic had no clue what to do with this  .
i is really enjoying playing around with this camera too  .
but i will have to return it and find another option because i cannot have pictures just disappear on me or show up corrupted  .
maybe someone has a suggestion about this , but i would be wary buying this camera .
if you look properly at the photos its got quite a bit of noise in the photos its like a mist appearing on the photos when u compare with other cameras like cannon , nikon etc etc the picture quality is not so good as they say .
