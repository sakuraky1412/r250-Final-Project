from the moment i booked via email and giorgina responded answering all my questions i knew i 'd made a great choice .
for a few days i was travelling alone and the hotel would no doubt make all the difference to my discovery of this incredible city .
owners giorgina and masimo were great- from organising my transfer , talking me through the best places to eat and streets to visit - you must do the museum of photography , to kindly going to pick up a bus ticket , booking a cooking course with souk cuisine - immense fun , and inviting me to join them for dinner .
talking of which house chef hiba cooked the best tagine of my holiday - just let them know by early afternoon if you would like to eat in and a sumptious feast ( or snack ) can be arranged .
the location is truly excellent - 6 mins to place jemma el fna .
i felt totally safe walking around after dark .
having returned twice to the city after i left them i realised how lucky i had been in this respect - the shopping street they are next too has a good selection of most things available in the souk but without the tourist crowds .
breakfast on the roof was delicious and set you up for the day .
sun loungers with towels and big straw hats are positioned close to a small cooling plunge pool - heavenly on a hot day . . . .

i really noticed in my two weeks in morroco how naturally curteous morroccans are to guests and how they genuinely want to ensure you have a good time - none more so than the staff here -el makky and mohammet just two whose name i remember .
oh a few other bits . . .
lovely eye for detail , great housekeeping and masimo knows of a tremendous hammam round the corner.
