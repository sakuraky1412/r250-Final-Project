the scenery presents a beautiful contrast of the lush green valleys with backdrop of the majestic dhauladhars , whose tops remain covered with snow for most of the year .
a short walk from here takes one to the awe inspiring bundla chasm .
the stream is a thin streak running over stony ground .
during the monsoon season , it swells & rages madly over the entire width of the chasm taking stones and boulders along with it making thunder like loud roaring noise .
one can enjoy panoramic view of the majestic dhauladhar mountain range besides soaking your tired feet in the cold water of the man made water channel in the garden lined with different flowers .
this is best place to hangout in the evenings especially if you are travelling with elderly & can not take them close to the waters of neugal khad thru rocky path .
they can still enjoy chilly waters in the water channel in the garden of this cafe that draws the cold waters of neugal river .
also one can enjoy evening tea & snacks in the garden restaurant .
a walk down from neugal cafe to the main market is definitely recommended , as it winds through tea plantations of the bundla tea estate on either side of the road .
the rooms are basic , but the staff is friendly .
food has to be ordered in advance .
a better option to stay is hptdc . . .
