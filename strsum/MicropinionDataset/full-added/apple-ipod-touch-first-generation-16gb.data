i have no problems with the ipod touch  .
i just think apple is some what ripping off customers when it comes to replacements .
this is obviosly the best ipod yet  .
great purchase  .
my favorite part is the internet  .
there is so much to do on it  .
the only thing taht i didnt like is that you had to have a wi    fi connection to use the internet  .
other than that , tjis is a great buy that will surely last a long time .
i also have a zune  .
and out of the two i love the ipod touch 16 gb first generation  .
i is able to get it for $199 on black friday so i got a good deal .
it is pretty much an awesome device  .
great response touch screen  .
youtube plays perfect  .
internet browser might be a turn off since it is on a small screen , but you can zoom in so far anybody can read it       it is pretty much a great device but might be a little expensive (apple came out with a new touch so it is cheaper)  .
the ipod touch is easy to use and a ton of fun to boot .

apple has done it again with the ipod touch  .
this is the only product that i've ever given a 10 , and it deserves it  .
this is the best touch screen that i've ever used  .
it is very responsive and makes browsing through your music fun  .
safari is amazing too  .
it's the only mobile internet that is comfortable to use  .
you tube is also another handy thing to have  .
i switched to this ipod from a 30 gig  .
video ipod , and i could not be happier .
i have to admit , there is more usage for this ipod than just music  .
if im bored , i got youtube videos i can watch , internet i can browse , apps i can install , games to play  .
best mp3 player i have owned  .
period .
this baby is by far , the best device purchase that i have ever made  .
runs smoothly and flawlessly , every aspect  .
cannot wait till a 3g iphone hits the market  .
i will toss my treo 700p in the trash and not look back  .
do not get me wrong , my treo 700p has been great , or so i thought  .
however , a 3g iphone will simply blow all other smartphones out of the water , and the ipod touch is beyond compare in the pda realm  .
forget wap (crap) internet browsing , get the real deal  .
add 3g data capabilities to this interface and the results will be spectacular  .
come on steve , you're killing me , please announce the iphone version 2  .
0 3g  .
the 2g at t edge network is unacceptable  .
this product is amazing  .
it has amazing video quailty , along with music and pictures  .
the internet works well , and safari is one of the best mobile browsers i have ever used  .
when the release of the sdk comes out , watch out the ipod touch just may take over the world .
i spent six months of my money economy to buy this revolutionary ipod  .
it is excellent business  .
everyone says that the ipod touch has a limited memory capacity , but who need 80gb  .
the 16gb are enough for me , i do not need so much memory  .
but , of course , the memory capacity still being the touch's main failure , to low compared with the 160gb of the ipod classic (almost two times the hard    disk of my laptop)  .
despite of the memory , everything else (in my opinion) is perfect in the touch  .
i loved it  .
i found that my ipod touch completely exceeded my expectations  .
i had an iriver previously , but after filling it's memory (6gb) i needed to look for something bigger i am a typical apple hater  .
i cannot stand ipods and have always been drawn to look for other options  .
however , living in australia presents a limited market and the only real options bigger than 6gb were the ipod classic or the ipod touch i am so happy i chose the touch  .
it doesn't feel like an ipod , which to me is a huge pro  .
i cannot stand the wheel mechanism on ipods such as the classic , it just annoys me  .
apart from using itunes , it is easy to forget that i am in fact using an ipod  .
the intuitive touch screen makes every use fun music  .
easily accessed through the menus    music is clear and high quality    shuffle , repeat and repeat one options available during playback  .
on    the    go playlist is easy to compose in the palm of your hand , wherever you may be menus  .
long menus can be easily skipped through using the alphabet at the side of the screen which allows you to jump immediately to a certain letter    coverflow is a great looking feature which , provided that you add covers , allows you to flick through your colourful cd collection in search of your favourite albums  .
(i experience no lag issues as some other users claim to)  .
easy to get back to music 'now playing' section no matter where you are in the menus    just double click the main menu button  .
a display pops up on screen to show what song is playing and allow you to skip , rewind , pause or change the volume of the song or simply return to the now playing screen  .
this feature is extremely helpful when browsing and you just want to change the song wi    fi  .
fun and easy to use  .
relatively quick (i suppose that depends on your connection though)  .
clear  .
you    tube feature is fun and extremely simple to use calender  .
now able to have events programmed into it (previously people complained that this was not possible but it seems that by the time i bought my touch , this problem had been rectified)  .
easy to use  .
contacts  .
holds everything you need to know about your contacts in one simple menu    easy and quick to add information  .
screen  .
high resolution  .
i protected mine with a 'protective film' from a retailer  .
$20au for 3 screen covers  .
i am still on my first (2 months after buying it) and there is not one scratch on the screen chrome backing  .
being an ipod/apple    hater , i hated the scratch prone backing that comes on ipods  .
i avoided this problem by buying a hard case for my touch  .
it has not got one scratch on it to this day , and i've had it for two months and have not been overly careful with it feel  .
light  .
thin (even with the case on it is thin and dynamic)  .
videos  .
clear (depending on the quality of the video)  .
simple playback  .
optional memory to begin playback at the last point of viewing  .
i cannot think of anything else to add  .
i have not been disappointed once with my ipod touch , even though i is extremely sceptical at the time of purchase  .
i highly recommend it , it's worth the money .
ok this product is amazing except two things  .
first with its big screen , this would be an awesome video player , but only 16 gigs for 400 bucks  .
plus the screen on some has had problems where it has gone dark , but they fixed it now so the touch is a slim product , multi touch high resolution screen , and as many features as any other mp3 player on the market combined  .
it has some flaws with memory , but with all the other things you can do with it , i still cant take a point of its score  .
its just sheer brilliance .
video and audio is great  .
hacked mine  .
great ipod buy it  .
unless you have already used a touch or iphone , then you can look forward to the day when you are blown away by the excellence of the screen on this device  .
my cousin has told me that the touch has a higher resolution screen than a television , and while i cannot say that i know this to be true , i can say that that anything displayed on the screen looks flawless and as good as real life  .
the device is super easy to use , and could also be used as a picture viewer  .
you can zoom in on photos with the device       all you have to do is press the screen in two places and move your fingers apart (you have probably seen this in the hundreds of iphone ads , and the touch also does this)  .
if you are sceptical about being able to press small web page links on the touch , then realize that i is as well , until i tryed the device  .
the touch mechanism is extremely accurate , and i hardly ever touch the wrong thing  .
the screen is very sensitive , but is perceptive to what the user wants to do  .
when scrolling down an internet page with your finger , you do not have to worry about pressing a link as the device recognizes the downward movement of the finger  .
if all else fails , you can zoom in on the web page like you would a picture , inorder to view small text or to click a small link  .
apple has obviously put a lot of work into making this device user    friendly  .
the only reasons to consider another device are the price and capacity  .
you as a buyer will have to decide how those affect your personal decision  .
but remember that this device is a true winner .
this is the best gadget i have and i love the wifi  .
i travel often and its a pain to bring my laptop  .
best of all this did not cost me anything  .
i got it from one of those sites that you sign up for an offer  .

best mp3 player on the market  .
apple reinvents inself again  .
amazing  .
i'm going to come out with this straight out of the gates i hacked my ipod touch before i even synced it up with my music because i knew it would be worth it  .
i'm running mail , maps , notes , everything an iphone has and more right now  .
that being said , this is the greatest gadget i've ever used  .
the interface is fantastic , the battery life is good compared to my 5g ipod video so i don't know what people are complaining about everything about this gadget is wonderful and there is nothing stopping you from hacking it as well and getting all the iphone apps on it  .
it really is worth it and makes this gadget worth it's weight in gold by my standards i'm a little torn between ratings here because i'd probably give the ipod touch an 8 if i had not hacked it , but it's so easy to do , anybody with a computer can do it in 15 minutes with little effort  .
i finally decided to give it a 10 because there really is nothing stopping you from hacking it and restoring it if you prefer having 6 icons on the home screen instead of 20+ apps  .
i loved the ipod touch the day and minute i got it  .
out of all the ipods i have had , this one tops it all  .
it is by far the best ipod and mp3and mp4 player ever  .
nothing gets any better than this  .
apple wins hands down on this one  .
if you are ever considering on buying the ipod touch , trust your instincts  .
buy it .
this product is amazing  .

this is an outstanding product  .
easy to use , and it came fully charged  .
converting videos and placing them on the ipod touch is easy  .
the videos look sharp and clean  .
the music is outstanding , photo viewer is sweet  .
fast internet browsing , surf and watch videos on youtube  .
there is nothing bad about this outstanding little product  .
if i have to choose one con about this , it would be finger print magnet  .
a perfect 10  .
i have had the apple ipod touch for over 2 weeks now and i couldn't be happier  .
the wonderfully reactive touchscreen , coverflow , wireless internet , youtube , i tunes , and video work flawlessly within this gadget  .
true , it doesn't make phone calls and it only comes in 8 to 16 gigs , but we must also put into consideration that it is unfair to compare this to the iphone because its not a phone  .
nevertheless , the touch performs spectacularly as an ipod  .
it is almost twice as thin as the first generation nano and it holds much more space  .
(needless to say future models will be built with higher capacity s , )  .
overall the touch is a great choice for someone who loves the iphone but does not have the at t service plan  .
pcman  .
no way  .
that is a long time ago before i became a mac addict  .
just to show my stupidity , i never changed my user  .
i fell in love with imacs , laptops well i never bought one  .
but this is about the touch this is the best mac purchase 'cept for my 20 inch  .
mac  design  .
u pc lovers are seriously demented or just need glasses mac is sleek , steve jobs is like , the father of design  .
but this is about the itouch , again  .
the 16g is too much space , but ths is one of the best purchases of my damn life  .
the cover flow multi    touch itunes store blah blah blah , i could rave on for hours , this has like , 10000000 diffrent things you can personalise  .
i own 3 ipods prior (all sold) and this thing has a million times better sound than any  .
and everything is at your fingertips  .
i just plugged it in to my 20 inch , and auto everything happend  .
before i knew it , my ipod had my 4gigs of music and 2g of pictures (along with one or two videos)and had connected through my airport  .
i generaly dont use wireless but it auto did so , i checked out the itunes store  .
i spent $17 extra that day the picture quality is just as featured and design like i said before was totally awseome  .
alltogether , i thanks and bow down to steve for this , i'd rather it over any other iphone or ipod  .

to everyone complaining about the lack of storage   it's flash flash memory ain't cheap and though , yes , there will be plenty of 32 , 64 , and eventually 100+ gb flash players out there , for right now this is more than decent i have 2000 songs , 4 movies , 10 tv shows , 40 podcasts , 300 photos and all of my addresses and contacts on my 16 gb touch (with just under 3 gb of space left) and i'd be surprised if that won't tide me over until the next time i'm able to sync it with my computer  .
i've had every ipod there is and we all must remember that hard drive based players eventually fail due to movement  .
i never had a problem with the 4 nano's i've had , nor the 2 shuffles  .
however , i've owned 7 different spinning hd    based ipods , and have had 3 of them kick it  .
i do not abuse my stuff , i just use it as a portable player  .
is it nice to have one's whole library available at all times  .
sure , but at what cost  .
the video on the touch is more than great and the scrolling/tapping features and overall intuitive interface of this ipod make it the best yet as far as i'm concerned the only drawback  .
if there's a qwerty keyboard for entering web addresses and the like , why is there no notepad or text editor of any kind  .
oh well , hopefully some kind of software update will address this .
if it was not for my iphone i would definitely get this  .
i wish i had the 16gb .
ok firstly i want to clearly state i own and physically posses an ipod touch  .
i heard on a tech website that you could purchase the touch at apple stores and that bestbuy had them in stock you simply just had to ask for one as they are not on display  .
i is able to purchase my 16gb touch at a bestbuy , after some compromise with a bestbuy employee who didn't want to allow me to purchase one after my 45minute drive to get one  .
needless to say i won  .
i purchased my touch on 9/16/07 despite the release date of 9/28/07  .
you can get one if you search , its pretty easy actually  .
once i got the device home i unboxed it and is supprised by the quality in which the item is packed  .
it came with the link cord an adapter for the standard doc , ear buds (not to bad) , microfiber cloth and paper work  .
i have never owned an ipod so it took me about 5 minutes to figure out how to link it after downloading itunes  .
i linked it to my desktop uploaded my library and immediately began editing content  .
initially i didn't know how i felt about my $470 dollar purchase  .
but after tinkering with it for a few days getting the album art up to date and using the wifi to browse the web in my apartment , i am addicted  .
people are complaing about capacity  .
if you ask me 80gb is over kill  .
the classic can hold over 40 , 000 songs  .
most people cannot come up with a 100 songs off hand that they listen to on a regular basis  .
the touch can hold 4 , 000 songs and you can change them at any time  .
don't get me wrong 80gb would be nice but the practicality of it is not so nesessary  .
most people don't even have 80gb hard drives in their computers  .
so don't let the capacity of the touch deter you from purchase  .
the interface is beautiful  .
the touch sceen provides large onscreen buttons that are easy to handle while driving , rather then fumble with the touch sensative doughnut of the standard ipod  .
i had originally planned on getting the classic because of capacity but after three days of shifting and reshaping content i haven't even used up 2gb  .
its a beautiful device the interface is awesome , the wifi with safari is a very useful feature  .
buy the tocuh  .
do not give this device a negative rating until you use it or you will most defintely eat your words .
the best and most easy to use ipod  .
beats the iphone in storage  .
also stop hating on apple people  .
how can you give such a low rating  .
no one cares if it has an fm tuner theres nopoint  .
thats why you buy an ipod to hold your music  .
and obviously if theyve never had an fm tuner why would they start now  .
best ipod ever wish it is cheaper and had more storage but i own 3 others so ill be buyin this one  .
this is a great player i am actually writing my review from it  .
it is out at certain stores i bought my in  .
nebraska for all the people who are crying about how it is such a bad product i just want to tell you don't have to buy it  .
i love mine able to check and write emails watch videos and download songs wifi  .
this is the best product out there  .
do not listen to what others are saying buy one if you can you will love it i promise  .
i oringinally had a creative zen but it broke so i got a gift card from bb and bought the touch and i love it .
a 10  .
the technology warrants it despite its minor flaws  .
there is no device like it on the face of the planet  .
is it worth 400 smackers with ony 16 gigs of storage  .
you bet  .
i'm a tech nut as most of you probably are , and i like value with my toys but i gladly will trade 30 gigs for this interface  .
the tactile elegance is simply without peer the browser function is brilliant  .
the ability to control it and pretty much everything else with your fingers is wonderfully implemented , and is so easy it's laughable even the youtube button , which i originally thought would be useless , is a thing of genious  .
it is wonderful fun sound quality  .
excellent  .
(with good headphones  .
) apple , why can you not include a nice set of buds with your $400  .
00 ipod  .
if you were a novice and stayed with the supplied phones , you might think the sound quality is sub    par  .
video quality  .
superb  .
wifi connectibility  .
a 4 year old would have no problem by now , if you're reading this , you know the other features the ipod touch is endowed with look , is 400  .
00 expensive for a 16 gig music/mp3 device  .
sure  .
is it expensive for the 16 gig ipod touch  .
nope  .
the touch interface alone is worth an extra 200  .
hey , you pay 1    200  .
00 for your pc or apple os , right  .
well consider this an os upgrade of the first order forget what the nay    sayers have to say   experience this now  .
when they upgrade the storage and add more features , you can always put it up for auction it is , without a doubt , the finest device in this genre you can buy , hands down ps plenty in stock at my local  .
ct apple store .
there are two sets of quotes that two different reviewers have said , and i dont think they can be stressed enough    .
the touch and iphone need to be flash base to keep its thinness , battery life , and speed  .
they are not putting standard hard drives in these devices because they are too heavy , prone to failure , and too thick for this ipod  .
thats all i wanted to say about flash memory vs a spinning hard drive .
ok , i just bought my ipod touch from the apple store this afternoon , i absolutely love it  .
it has everything i want in an ipod plus more  .
i'm just coming back from a mosh and it survived it without a scratch  .
i'd still recommend you get a case though , just to be safe  .
its very simple and easy to use (apple , of course) and everything works flawlessly  .
this is truly their best ipod yet , it looks like something that came out of a sci    fi film , but i assure you , its completely real  .
the flash memory is very quick and it is made for safari  .
web pages are clear and easy to read  .
the built in youtube player is ingenious , and it works very well  .
i have not tried the wi    fi itunes store yet , but i have heard it is very good  .
i could go on and on about this amazing product  .
i have noticed that apple sometimes uses cheap parts in their electronics , but this is not one of them , the material is very nice and rugged .
i have to say that this device fascinates me  .
the iphone fascinated me , i wanted to get one  .
but i wasnt gonna drop 600$ for one nuh uh , nor is i willing to do a 2year phone contract that is ludicrous anyway so bam , here comes the ipod touch   everything that made the iphone amazing , and minus the phone part which i can totally live without , i already have a phone  .
its also thinner , its as thin as my current samsung player , which ive always referred to as annorexicly thin  .
so thats great  .
features , yeah theyre amazing too  .
sure the iphone has more , but this is just an ipod  .
and it has the itunes music store  .
youtube  .
now i can just sit wherever (within wifi of course) and just watch youtube movies if i get bored of what i have  .
everything else thats major is all here  .
except for email and google maps , which technically speaking i dont see why are not there  .
im sure the touch could completely handle it  .
but my guess is that the business dudes at apple guessed that yeah this is a substitute device that is going to draw a lot of demand away from the iphone (ex   me) so lets keep some features iphone only  .
so no google maps or email on the touch cuz they still want some people to be interested in the iphone and alas  .
space  .
16gbs  .
absurd  .
but wait is it  .
is it really absurd  .
perhaps for the ignorant out there it is (im not saying im not , im just sayin i understand why)  .
ok , the purpose of the ipod touch is to be a super advanced media player that is also small , sleek , and super sexy  .
the only way to go to meet that requirement storage wise is flash memory (which is much more expensive gig per gig than a hdd)  .
it saves volumetric space and saves energy  .
plus its not as heat prone (that  better circuit usage) so although i would be much happier with a lot more than 16 gb , at the same time im completely happy with 16gb cuz i know that that number is already a really high number to fit in flash (yeahhh i know some laptops have like 40 gig of flash but thats a laptop not a 4 ounce ipod ) plus for the average user 16gb is plennnnnty of space  .
and even for more moderate users , you can still manage with 16 , its not thatttt bad  .
if you want more space there is the ipod classic that has 80 or 160 gb that does music and video  .
they made (in hindsight) it specifically for those people who would complain about the touch's small capacity so yeah , in the end  .
amazing device and will most likely be worth every penny (cuz i havent actually gotten it yet derr , but it has every symptom of it)  .
apart from being an outstanding music player , it can now be used to watch full length movies tv shows purchased from itunes store the wifi ability is truly awesome  .
no more lugging a laptop around on vacations  .
just use your ipod to hook up into your hotel's wifi connection actually the most exciting things about the ipod touch is that it is a really powerful os x computer  .
and with apple opening up the ipod to third party software vendors , expect to see all sorts of software specially designed for the ipod to make it more powerful than ever thanks apple  .
keep the good work going  .
best ipod , every thing you want from a mp3 player  .
internet is fast too .
i olready ordered mine , and cant wait , it exactly wut i wanted , how could u guys rate it if u dont even have it  .
this is the most brilliant thing apple has made in a long time  .
they're giving people exactly what they wanted an iphone without the phone  .
forget $60/month , keep the perfect media features and rich web browser  .
absolute genius just wait until they make a 32gb ipod touch once the price of flash goes down  .
this thing is a true killer .
i get so tired of people rating a product when they do not even have one in their hands  .
this is not a rate by what you have heard , it is supposed to be a rating for people that have purchased one and have hands on experience with the device giving their opinions  .
come on people  .
and yes , i had to put a number in to submit this , so i gave it a 10 as the specs sound good  .
this is just what i wanted  .
i recently returned my iphone because i loved the ipod but hated the phone  .
im back to using my old 4th gen ipod but will definitly buy this  .
it has all the good parts of iphone but cheaper  .
the best ipod to date  .
simply the easiest and best looking  .
a must buy  .
the best .
one of the best purchases i've made in the past 2 years is the apple ipod touch  .
i is one of the early adopters of the product and it has been extremely rewarding seeing the opening of the app store , etc  .
which took the product to a another league entirely  .
prior to the app store it is mainly a touch screen media player , but with the app store it turned into a fully functional entertainment productivity device there are not many downsides but among the most pronounced is the lack of video codec support  .
although there are many video converters available , it can be quite time consuming to convert all movies to mp4 format  .
in addition the battery can drain quite quickly with wifi turned on , not to mention when you are playing games all in all , you will not be disappointed with purchasing one of these  .
i absolutely looooove my itouch , like you have no idea i've had it for over a year and it's great , and worth the money first of all , by simply tapping the home button twice you can pause , swith songs , and adjust volumes without having to slide to unlock it's also sooooo easy to unlock and lock the ipod touch you can also pause , change songs , and adjust volume by double clicking the home button in the middle of using the wifi , or playing a game without having to stop what you are doing the touch screen , unlike a lot of phones , is amazing and the keys are usually pretty easy to use although they are a little small barely any flaws in this device everything is so easy to use , and it doesn't take long so even if you're impatient like me it won't matter it's worth the money , but the screen and back do scratch easily so you need to get a screen protector which is just a clear covering the back dents easily too when you tilt it the itouch it's very responsive and very fast even though i've had it for over a year i haven't had any technical problems with it yet , and i don't treat it nicely i've dropped it , and i do not have a case but it's always in my bag with other things you can adjust the brightness of the screen easy , and on it's highest , it's verrrry bright the battery life is really good , and it lasts a long time even with only 20% battery life left , unless you're playing games which is a whole nother thing it's skinny , and the color quality is great it's also easy to download new apps onto the touch , move them around , and delete them , without syncing it to your computer the only real problem i've had is with the wifi , it's very sensitive and your connectivity changes with every move , so it can be annoying but it is easy once you are on a website to scroll , enlarge , and type things in definitely buy this , it's worth the money , trust me if you have any questions just ask  .
updated  .
on feb 19 , 2009  .
i have more song than i need , enough videos to fit my entertainment needs , and not to mention the 58 applications , and i still haven't had any problems besides a slight decrease in speed when opening different windows  .
the price , is completely worth it in my opinion  .
i have had no trouble with the screen , the touch response has not dimmed in the slightest , and everything works just as well as the day i bought it  .
this is easily one of my top favorite products i've ever purchased , and i sure as the sun will come up tomorrow will buy another when mine becomes outdated .
overall a very nice product , when you get down to it all the features in v2 work well  .
the version of safari works excellent and is compatible with almost all webpages minus some flash based objects  .
the screen is verhy vibrant for excellent video quality but will attract smudges not scratches (very good scratch protectant coating)  .
the wifi is fast and will work throughout my house but again does not get as strong a signal as my laptop or xb 360 sitting right beside it  .
very easy to upgrade firmware but you have to pay for most unfourtanetly  .
the inegrated youtube and google maps apps are welcomed and work excellent  .
it charges fast for a portable device but battery life is somewhat lacking when doing intensive tasks such as web browsing and watching you tube videos  .
the music interface which is what makes it an ipod is as well sleek  .
the only thing i noticed is that the bundled earphones do not really do its sound quality justice  .
video format support is limited so you pretty much have to buy them from apple again a great product overall .
i've had my ipod touch for almost an year now and it's been awesome  .
however , i do regret spending $400 plus tax for an 16gb pvp  .
the internet , youtube and video work very well but the music quality is not as good as the other ipods with the white earbuds that come with it  .
i had to spen $100 on shure se110 to actually get a good sound out of it i hope that the ipod touch 2nd generation will offer the following    .
cheaper for more memory  .
microsd , minisd , or sd card slot  .
flash enabled web  .
a different back (i hate the scratch attracting back)  .
bluetooth  .
vibrate support like iphone  .
volume rocker  .
a better design for the sides (preferably one like the iphone)  .
avi video support  .
flash drive usage  .
better music quality  .
speakers  .
better battery (altho it's not bad at all rite now)  .
and a camara but not really hoping  .
also , i personally think apple is a bit cheap  .
i think for such a high end player , apple charger dock and apple in    ear earphones should be included  .
this is an incredible device  .
first of all i compared it's video side by side with the video of my friend's iphone and there is no difference whatsoever , even in dark scenes  .
secondly , the $9  .
99 software 2  .
0 update includes all of the news apps (weather , stocks , etc  .
) as well as the app store  .
memory i admit is a problem , but aside from that i see only one flaw   because of apple's business savvy attempt to market the product as an ipod that does other things as opposed to a next generation multimedia device , they failed to include the iphone's external speaker  .
this greatly depreciates the value of the youtube player and the device's high    end video capabilities  .
i would advise apple to include this in a later model as it would increase sales  .
regardless , i highly reccomend the 16 gb model to ipod lovers and new mp3 players users alike .
i love my ipod touch  .
my real complaint is the near total uniformity of available accessories basically , i want a cushioned hard shell case with a hard flipover cover for the screen so i can put it in my pocket without worrying about breaking the glass  .
astonishingly , there's nothing on the market like this  .
the closest i can find is a wimpy leather case with a soft flip cover ideally , i'd like the above plus a connected speaker in the case and space for aaa (or aa) batteries to work around the less    than    optimal battery issue i do not mind if it's bigger , i just want to protect my expensive little toy think star trek communicator  .
i am aware of the otterbox , but it's just not quite it .
it is almost everything in the test    so just by it  .
went into the local radioshack looking at several different models and options (apple and others)  .
i have never been a big apple fan  .
staff there is extremely helpful in looking at what i really needed it to do and did a great job directing me to the right product    no hard sell on the highest priced product have been in love with this device since getting it home  .
easy to set up and i continue to find more reasons love this device .
i love my ipod touch  .
as stated above , i have only 2 complaints  .
the first is it's internet capability is constrained by 'hot zones' (though , having cellular capability is possible with the iphone       but that costs more)  .
the other is simply the amount of hard drive space it has  .
i am hoping apple comes out with a 60gb ipod touch and i'll be perfectly satisfied  .
the ipod touch is just superb  .
i know people who don't use macs and love the ipod touch (no , they did not care about the ipod but used similar mp3 players instead) .
donald bell said it all .

its not a scam their site has videos of a cnn reporting it totally legit  .
try it you wont be sorry .
this is simply the best ipod out there , besides the iphone  .
it's very good , because it's just like a mini computer how you can download things and use applications  .
the memory is quite small for the price and should be a little cheaper  .
if it is the iphone price , that would be perfect  .
the battery life is a little short if you use applications , but for only music its acceptable  .
other than that , this is just an ipod you should pick up .
i'm amazed i had always loved ipods cause of their simple way to browse your music with clickwheel their lovely interface and the way they sync with my pc , but this is incredible  .
i've owned a first gen shuffle and a 2 gen nano but when i saw a friend showing a couple of pictures in a so elegant way , i could not resist it after seeing this i asked for more , and after a lot of asking he agreed to borrow it for a day , it is amazing i could do everything with it , everything  .
surf the web while listening to my music is my fav  .
safari , youtube , mail , maps (google maps with fake gps) , itunes wi    fi store (very cool) , calendar , notes and a lot , lot more installing third    party apps for the touch used to be illegal , but now apple introduces the app store , which is self    explanatory  .
(yay  .
but not everything is that cool  .
my first disappointing was , well , the price  .
it's kind of expensive for the capacity you are getting there's no flash , damn it  .
no bluetooth  .
no speakers  .
the touch upgrades are paid upgrades , unlike the iphone , who gets the same upgrades , but free (grrr )  .
bottom line  .
the touch is beautiful , almost prefect , my fav ipod by far but not cheap .
to get a wifi connection for ur ipod touch , first check and see if you have a router for your home computer connection  .
if you do , go to home on ur ipod  .
then go to settings  .
touch wifi , and find a connection that has the same name as your router , and use the bar code number as the password , and voil�  .
i've used a palm pda forever and never found a suitable alternative until now    i love my itouch  .
(my nano stays in my stereo system now  .
) itouch is very easy to use    right from the beginning there is everything on it i want   outlook with my calendar , contacts , email ; music ; web browsing ; maps ; notes ; beautiful photo organization viewing ; and more  .
it is not only gorgeous to look at it is amazing to use  .
i highly recommend  .
purchased this 2 months ago to upgrade my 1 1/2 year old 30gb video ipod (gen 5)  .
i love the much large display and the touch screen  .
i purchase a rubberized cover from ebay for under $10 including shipping  .
i have 4 movies , 90 songs , a few pictures , and about 15 hours of podcasts and still not quite 50% full  .
i rarely completely filled my 30 gb ipod , so i am doing good with the 16 gb itouch  .
the wifi is really cool but drains the battery much faster  .
i is able to connect to wifi with wpa encryption at home and work without any problems  .
i saved both wifi profiles so i do not have to input the wpa pass phrase everytime i reconnect  .
the google maps works really well with both satellite and street names mode  .
web browsing is a little different as pages are really small so you have to zoom in using the pinch touch which is easy to do  .
screen orientation helps when reading text and viewing photos  .
just turn the itouch to one side  .
syncing with web mail is easy  .
gmail , yahoo mail is simple  .
i'm going to try to synch with my work's exchange web mail interface in a few weeks or so when i get some time the 3  .
5 mm headphone jack is located at the bottom edge of the unit , next to the docking station connector  .
i'm used to it being on top like my video ipod  .
i use this jack to connect to my truck radio's 3  .
5mm aux connection to listen to podcasts while on the road  .
one big difference i miss on my video ipod is the wheel for rewinding a podcast or song for a certain amount of time  .
i could spin the wheel on my video ipod and know how far to go for say rewinding 15 , 30 , or so many seconds  .
on the itouch you touch the screen and get a straight bar with a pointer  .
if you're listening to a 2 hour podcast and just touch the bar , it's difficult to only move back 30 seconds or so to replay a part you missed becasue you needed to adjust for traffic or your cell phone started ringing other than these few items , i'm very happy with the itouch  .
i cannot wait to load some third party apps when they start coming out  .
i recommend this itouch to all my friends .
i love ipod touch  .
i would trade up to iphone it had a normal headphone connector like the ipod touch  .
i have several high end headphone sets , hate the idea of needing a clumsy adaptor for iphone  .
ipod touch goes everywhere with me .
ipod touch is for sure a great product  .
is the best audio player gui i ever seen , but is far more than this  .
with all apps you can run , it will fast replace your palmtop but apple seems to be looking only for iphone , since ipod touch updates and softwares are paid (and only for countries with apple stores) jailbreak it is an alternative option to make this product the best in it's category and worth the paid price the space is enough to save some apps and of course more than 2000 music (aac format) , but we would like to have a 160gb device like ipod classic .
i bought the 8gb ipod touch mainly because i have a pretty small music collection  .
i have about 2 gigs of music on it , along with 6 gigs of movies  .
i use it when i am working out mostly  .
i watch movies while on the treadmill , music while lifting , etc  .
the internet wifi capability is incredible  .
the keyboard and expandable viewing is a bit tricky at first , but once you get the hang of it , it is a non issue  .
the weather , stock , notes , and contacts are very useable and useful i have had no problems with bugs or break downs  .
i have it completely loaded with data and use the internet constantly yes things will get better and more technological savvy units will come out , but if you want a fun , useful , sleek , and reliable highteck media player the ipod touch is for you huge fan here  .
i hesitate between excellent and spectacular , because the features are wonderful , going on internet wirelessly , looking for or emails , stocks , weather informations , itunes , you tube , excellent sound but the hiss is there and even when music plays it hides under .
if they only made the iphone for the verizon network then i'd buy it  .
until then , this thing rocks  .
it would be even better if i could have internet on the att network but what the heck , what a machine  .
the ipod is great for all the same reasons as the iphone  .
also if you have such a huge screen then you must put videos on there and videos take a lot of memory  .
32gb is still not enough for me i back things up all the time from my computer to my old ipod video and i pretty much use it like a flash drive  .
without disk mode some third party programs cannot be used for it either  .
flash support is on other devices and it is very prominent on the internet  .
videos included  .
(take a look at skyfire , a new browser for windows mobile and soon to be symbian)  .
the ipod touch looks sexy and functions perfectly sound quality is ok , not the best  .
the large screen makes it great to view videos the apps availible through the january software update are pretty good on the whole , apple's ipod touch is a really good product and is definitely worth a look .
overall this the best portable media player money can buy  .
it is more expensive than others , but its interface is so much better and everything it does , it does extremely well  .
it is definitely worth every penny  .
if you want more features , you can always hack it and add virtually anything you want  .
it's not too hard to do ; plenty of people are out there to help  .
if it had an external volume control like on the iphone , it would be more convenient  .
an fm tuner would also be nice .
i bought mine only about a month after it came out  .
i didn't even have it that long before there were software updates for it  .
then not too long ago i find out that theres another update for it with new applications for it  .
i still have not downloaded those yet but they look interesting  .
other than the fact that apple has chosen to provide more applications for the touch , for those of us who bought the touch before they were added to it , at a price of $19  .
99 this is a great ipod .
the ipod touch in overall is one amazing product it has the same interface as the iphone and the same 3  .
5 wide screen which is amazing for watching videos either on the videos or on youtube , either way it is amazing , one of the things that i did not like is that it had no speakers that is a bummer but over all the ipod touch is one amazing product but the lack of a camera and speakers lowers it down to a 9 .
first of all i have to say that at this moment i am actually on my ipod touch doing this review  .
i love this thing secondly , am enjoying this predoctove text it i'd doing because if i accidently hit thebwrong letter it i'd really good and predicting what i wanted to toe and all i have to hit is the space bar andor auto corrects it for me i really love the calender on this thing too  .
i used to use my phone's calendar but this blows it out of the water  .
the reason why i don't have an iphone is because i cannot afford a $30 a month data plan  .
with the ipod touch there is no plan  .
and since i text all the time i like something with buttons , not a touch screen i do wish the battery life is a little better  .
i have to charge it every night before i to to sleep but i do use it a lot during the day so i'd you do not you probably get away with a day and a half without charging it  .
two days would be very little use all    in    all i really love the touch for music , internet when i need to check espn  .
com or email , and the calendar which i use religiously  .
if you have the cash for one and you are looking for a new mp3 player go with the touch  .
it's a little pricey but in the long run all the things you'll use it for will be worth every penny .
this player by far has the best interface of any mp3 player that i've ever used  .
now 32gb of storage is available it makes this player even more attractive  .
this player is extremely slim yet suprisingly sturdy and well built  .
the screen is extremely scratch resistant  .
at first there were some restrictions and limitations on the apps , but firm ware updates have solved almost all of my complaints  .
my major complaint is the sound quality  .
the fidelity is passable , but i don't even think that the sound quality does not even compete with players from sony , creative , iriver , and microsoft  .
besides that wireless sync would be a gread bonus  .
i think that apple is going to make great money the way there making things  .
apple is by far the smartest company yet .
i bought my itouch at a local sams club i am sooo impressed  .
s easy to use had one problem with a video download so i contacted itunes support problem fixed in less than one hour and my money refunded for the faulty video  .
this device is superb  .
how abot adding a camera and an sd card option on the next gen itouch  .
then this baby would be heaavenly  .
when hacked this can be fun to hack and verry use full aplications  .
i got this for christmas and love it  .
it is the coolest thing i have ever seen i jailbroke mine , and have alot of applications installed which makes it better very nice to have when your in the country  .
at grandma's house and have nothing to do hahaha  .
although i had a mp3 player for several years i had not been an ipod user before  .
i saw the touch in november when i went in to apple to look for my daughters new g3 nano  .
it is love at first site  .
i had played with the notion of getting an iphone , but decided against because of the contract i knew in buying the touch that it had limited space for the price  .
i wanted it for the looks , the wifi , and the address book and calendar  .
instead of my mp3 player and a palm , i now only use my touch  .
it allows me to leave my laptop at the hotel or in my office when i am travel the video display looks good to me and i honestly cannot tell if the audio quality is not perfect  .
it sounds much better than the sansa i had before i took only several days to realize that i needed a cover for the touch because the back cover is very quick to smear and scratch  .
i is able to pick up two silicone skins for $10 and they fit great and do not detract from the sleek looks my one big want for the touch is the ability to download and play ipod games while the get started manual with the touch is limited in it's information the actual manual on apple  .
com is extremely useful in getting the full functionality out of the touch .
this is a great device and really is innovative and beyond user friendly  .
it is very pricey but you get what you pay for  .
i thought the memory would be a huge issue , but actually it is not that bad i have a large video and tv show collection from itunes and while i cannot put all the tv shows i can put a whole season of the closer and all of my 75 music videos on the device and that is fine the cover flow and menus on the touch are far superior to other ipods and very easy to use  .
it really makes the experience worth it and is the deciding factor in getting the touch yes it is basically an iphone without the phone but for those that don't care for at t like me or do not need a phone , this is a great buy if you plan to buy it consider costco for it ss the return policy is much more liberal and i did have to return the first one for a blown pixel but it is an earlier version of the product  .
so be sure to get the latest version made and it should be excellent  .
how to set it up was not obvious          when you first turn it on , the screen doesn't look like you see in the store , which is frustrating  .
you cannot set up an itunes account directly from the ipod , which isnt explained          if you try to purchase music right away , you wont be able to  .
with that said , once everything is set up , this is an amazing device  .
i have used smart phones for several years (currently have a treo with windows mobile) and none of the smart phones ive had          even those able to surf the web          can hold a candle to the touch ipod  .
i bought it for my wife but find myself playing with it constantly  .
i cannot remember the last time i have seen an electronic device that is this much fun and well designed  .
it has direct links to itunes and youtube  .
being able to download music over wifi directly to this super thin device is incredible  .
this device is so well , cool that i would consider getting an iphone  .
the ipods never really wow    ed me until this one       the touch is in a different class from any of the other ipod models or mp3 players i've seen  .
i highly recommend going into an apple store to play with one even if you do not buy one .
this is a beautiful player  .
the capacity is fine for me maybe not others but for me it will do  .
the music , video and photos look great the web is beautiful but i wanted flash no biggie the add on mite come when apple releases its sdk in feb .
this is my first ever ipod and i have to say that i absolutely love it  .
the touch screen is easy to use and responsive to my touch  .
the user interface is absolutely dead simple  .
the wi    fi is an excellent touch to this already amazing product  .
the safari web browser is very easy to use and simplistic  .
the design of this ipod is superb  .
it's very thin and lighter than i originally thought this ipod is not exactly a bargain  .
you do get want you pay for , however  .
but , $400 is pricey for an ipod with only 16gb of storage  .
also , watching movies on the screen is good  .
the video on this ipod is not amazing but , it's enough to watch comfortably overall , this is an amazing product  .
i do not regret a penny spent on this product  .
it's the best touch    based mp3 player out there , period  .
the ipod touch is an amazing product for listening to music , videos , viewing photos , browsing the internet , and more  .
i highly reccomend this product and have been playing with it for the last few days and cannot find any major downsides to this product .
the best stocking filler in ireland    if only movies or tv were available to purchase  .
no wonder piracy is thriving here  .
let me tell you , i is blown away when my wife bought me a touch for my birthday  .
i must have been a very good boy to deserve such a wonderful present  .
and i have had a great time with this gadget i am currently on the road in sweden and the tv programs are not entertaining after a full day of work  .
so i whip out my touch and watch the complete season of chuck  .
i am catching up on this show while i am out of town i love this ipod  .
i had a 30gb 2nd gen ipod for a long time that i have used all the time and is happy to upgrade to a new version .
i thought i knew just about all there is to be known about the ipod and the syncing of same , but �� proving the adage regarding aged canines and new skills �� forum visitor madmaxmedia set me straight on a very useful way to add media to your ipod i now know that you needn��t add music and movies to itunes and then sync the ipod to itunes to add that media  .
instead , you can simply flip the ipod into manual syncing mode (you do this by selecting the ipod in itunes�� source list , click the summary tab , and enable the manually manage music and videos option) , and drag the media from its current location to the ipod in the source list to answer the ��so what  .
�� question , this is useful for those times when you don��t have the storage space to add all the media you��d like to your itunes library  .
so , for example , you can burn a heapin�� helpin�� of music as data to a dvd  .
or convert a couple of favorite movies to ipod    compatible format and burn them to a dvd  .
when you want to move that material to the ipod , just insert the dvd and drag its contents from the disc to the ipod in the source list  .
it will be copied directly to the ipod without being added to the itunes library the media needn��t be stored on a cd or dvd  .
you can just as easily use a hard drive or usb thumb drive .
let's say one thing , in the first week i got this lovely electronic device , i had to charge it numerous times  .
this was not due to short battery life , this is due to how much i is using the darn thing  .
my favorite feature is of course the wifi capability  .
i love the capability of being able to surf the internet from just about anywhere without the need to have a clunky laptop  .
apple also provides 3rd party webapps that one can go to and use through their web site that act like the application is on your device without actually taking up any disk space (sports scores , games , blogs , weather , etc  .
) the touch capability rocks (finally)  .
one other thing , the front of the unit does not scratch at all like all previous ipod versions (it's about time  .
for people who want a simple unit that has wifi capabilities and web surfing without fees or using phone minutes , plays your favorite music , views your favorite videos and photos without being a phone , camera , small interface , etc  .
, this is the device for you  .
go for it , you'll love it  .
it is a very good music and video player , but there is no lyrics and third party applications support .
i gave this a 9 even though i have some gripes cus it pros make up cor the cons big time  .
pros are what you expect    fancy design , touch screen , just fun to use a touch screen etc cons    the screen has some wierd blurps of lighter and darker spots when on black screens (i am as picky as they come so if you ar not ocd you wont notice)but you have to really look for them  .
i have the biggest hands i have ever seen (i'm 6'7) so the keys are sometimes hard to press correctly so sometimes i have to use my stylus and sometimes i dont hit the exact spot to enter a key  .
itunes wi    fi music store only allows music downloads not video so no buying new movies or tv shows on the go the screen    is anti    scratch glass  .
if you dont think that makes much of a difference go to 'youtube  .
com' and search 'ipod touch scratch test' where the guy scratches it with a safety pin , a key and even a razor blade but there are noooooo marks at all  .
memory    is small for the price but if you dont have a ton of songs you'll be fine but it only holds (10 hrs    8 gig) (20 hrs    16 gig) max of video so thaat may be a problem for some but not for me cus i'm not gonna watch the same episodes of 'family guy' over and over again and you can delete videos right on the touch instead of having to do so through itunes but you cant delete music w/o itunes also    the sound seems fine to me  .
i can hear all the same details as with my $250 comp speakers when played with itunes  .
video is great and clear with 'chapters' for movies  .
the photos look stunning and the 'pinch' feature works very well  .
music is very very very easy to browse but i dont use cover    flow cus it looks cool but takes up time  .
the itunes wi    fi store is great to browse    preview , buy , download to the touch and upload to your comp  .
there's a wierd feature to download the music that starbucks is playing while your one of their cafes (they dont play the best music so pretty useless to pay for it) but they only have it in new york city and seattle now and wont expand service until '08 in very few cities like chicago and la  .
it sucks that you cant buy videos through wi    fi caution there are some bad models with poor screens that will display dark sceens in video very badly so if this seems to be a problem with yours exchange it for a new one instead of just returning it  .
overall    very satisfied  .
i convinced my sister to return her new nano (3rd gen) to get the touch  .
it has so many more features and capabilities it's just worth the extra $ .
this ipod has put my prior 4 ipods to shame  .
the only complaint is that 16g is a bit small for $399  .
still the amazingly cool interface still keeps people in awe as i show them pictures (complete with pinch stretch) , video clips of my kids and cover flow of all my music (at least all the 4    5 star rated songs anyway) there are a few things i would change about the interface but they are minor  .
my only software complaint is the fact that they (apple) application locked the device  .
why are there no games  .
i know there is a workaround for this but it is not supported by apple and the cheezy web stuff just does not cut it  .
anyway , i would strongly reccommend this device  .
it is thin , sleek , portable and makes it easier than ever to find and play my songs kudos apple  .
i have it for about a week , and i love it hopefully my opinions wont change sometimes ill listen to a song i do not like because the album artwork is displayed so well if you need the best thing out there , this is for you if you just need to listen to music , this probably isnt for you .
considering i paid the same for the 1st gen  .
ipod years ago which is still in daily use it was not hard to justify buying this had it on a table in a bar playing a home movie of the dog dancing for his supper and people going by the table just had to stop and watch  .
it's hard to believe how good it looks .
i love my ipod touch  .
i've had it for about a month now and have enjoyed it very much  .
the screen is great ; i didnt have any trouble at all with the screen being too dark and its very clear  .
i use safari all of the time , its a great way to check facebook/email/ sports scores and for general web browsing  .
there are only a few applications compared to the iphone , but that will change when the sdk is released by apple in february  .
i would definately recommend the ipod touch to anyone that doesnt want to pay the extra monthly fee for wireless edge access and doesnt want to be tied in to at t for the 2 year contract  .
its really thin (8 mm) and is fun to use  .
the audio/video quality is also great  .
i would deffinately recommend it  .
this is an awesome ipod  .
there is no reason to buy any other unless you want to carry your whole music and video library with you  .
how much can you listen to in one or two days anyways  .
i think this is perfect for podcast listening  .
new podcast come out every day or week so you need to listen to them and get the new ones often  .
16 gb is fine  .
i really recommend this .
just got this last week and its amazing  .
the touch screen is fantastic , clear and precise  .
the ipod performs well , battery life it good , etc anyway , thought it would be useful to show you how to install the iphone apps on the ipod touch  .
also on the site is how i managed to get the ipod touch a lot cheaper than amazon  .
see here http  //www  .
free    ipod    touch  .

html  .
so to sum up   with the ability to install 3rd party apps on the ipod makes this definately the best yet  .
although apple has limited this natively , with the guide at http  //www  .

i had bought a new ipod classic a week ago and is hugely dissapointed  .
apple seemed to rush it and there were major bugs in it  .
i exchanged it for the touch and it is great  .
it has a beautiful display and hols everything i need in an mp3 player  .
apple spent a lot more time with the touches design and program than with the classic  .
a+++++++ apple  .
while apple did not intend this to be a pda , it is the best one i have ever used  .
once it is jailbroken (ie , hacked to put software on it) , it has the functionality that i have been seeking for years  .
it is light weight (under 5 oz) , a slick calendar and email client and an excellent web browser  .
one can switch from portrait and landscape modes that create greater visibility  .
the touch screen is marvelous compared to the pressure sensitive screens of other pdas  .
and the price is comparable to similar featured pdas .
now i can copy movies to my ipod using dvd x copy  .
wi fi is great , just a little slow even on broadband  .
put a screen cover on it to protect it .
the ipod touch is without a doubt the very best portable media player i have ever owned at 16 gb flash memory capacity , this device has no equal if you are like me and want only to present a professional image in the office , pulling this out of my inside blazer pocket makes me look sharp  .
the capacity is amazing and the sound quality (from cheap earbuds) is so good , i am hearing the same songs better  .
i can actually hear things i did not know existed in the music , such as echos and other instruments sound more clear the built    in preset i chose is bass boost and it simply must be heard (on your own earbuds or earphones) to be believed while the screen is a finger    print magnet , the supplied polish cloth takes care of that videos actually look sharper when converted through itunes then what you get on youtube (at a fraction of the size) you can watch any youtube video    not just the featured or privelaged ones this unit is cool to the touch , even after hours of continuous use and is cool after charging recommended   yes  .
in spain is the unique way to feel the new iphone experience .
this is , with no doubt , the best ipod ever  .
it has an interface that is so intuitive ; it's easier than learning to be toilet    trained  .
(i mean , seriously , there are only two tactile buttons  .
and that's an upside , by the way)  .
the touch interface is not just cool , it's actually really easy to use and useful , a rare feat for a gimmick  .
(i'm looking at you , windows flip 3d)  .
oh , and it's so thin , i think it might cut me one day  .
it's also the best video player in apple's ipod line    up ever , albeit with quite a scarce amount of storage (due to the insanely high price of high    capacity nand flash chips)  .
but , i mean , i would never be able to watch 5 movies between syncs  .
i'd just never get around to it  .
but you can finally watch a full movie on an ipod now , and not feel you've missed out on visual details that are only available on a tv or pc/mac now for the main course  .
internet  .
safari is amazing  .
it will happily open almost any site , and render it as though you were viewing it on your pc/mac browser  .
and double    tapping to zoom always works perfectly  .
it zooms so well , you forget you are actually surfing the web on a 3  .
5 screen  .
oh , and everything is super    sharp , thanks to the 163 ppi led    backlit screen  .
absolutely astonishing  .
it's in fact has a higher pixel density than most laptops and desktop lcds , which means everything comes up sharper  .
oh , and the convenience    it's just plain awesome  .
you can go anywhere in your house and access wi    fi  .
way easier than getting out your laptop or booting up your pc/mac to quickly check an e    mail or go on im  .
way    cool oh , and i haven't even touched (no pun intended) on the other features of the ipod touch , which i'm sure you've read about elsewhere  .
un    scratch    able optical quality glass front , youtube , etc one tiny annoyance   it doesn't work with the apple ipod radio remote at all , so do not get your hopes up , folks  .
and sorry , no podcasts on the itunes wi    fi music store , though searching on it is really easy p  .
s beware , users with windows vista with photos stored on a sata hdd  .
your photos synced onto the ipod touch may come out very distorted and may only copy a small amount of your collection before an error message pops up  .
apple has a support article about this  .
the article id is 306525 .
when the iphone came out i wanted it really really bad but i didn't want to pay that much and i really only wanted it for the touch screen and ipod  .
i knew that apple would come out with an ipod version of the iphone and when it did , i is first in line (well online) to purchase it  .
i love the album art when the song is playing , i love the wi    fi capability and videos are unbelievable on it  .
plus it is so thin , i feel like i may break it any time now  .
it is way better than my 5th gen ipod  .
yes it only has a small capacity , i have the 16gig but i am not one who has tons of music and videos  .
for those of you like me who have a good handful of songs , some videos then the ipod touch is for you  .
the only con for this is that i have the apple remote/radio and it does not support it yet but i am sure apple will have support for it soon seeing that online it lists the remote as something that works with the ipod touch  .
anyone willing to shell out $400 for the best ipod out there , i would say go for it  .
you will not be disappointed .
this is the best ipod ever  .
i love it one of my bigger complaints is the lack of applications  .
but now apple released a website directory of applications  .
games , facebook and more  .
i love it  .
look at it    .
now things are getting better  .
apple added a dedicated website directory for ipod touch and iphone  .
over 200 of them  .
now i am happier than ever with my touch check that out    .

i love my itouch  .
yes it's a little pricey but definately worth it , especially if you don't already have the iphone  .
i like my verizon phone and plan on keeping it and don't want to get an iphone so i bought the itouch  .
the safari web browser works great , the videos i downloaded onto the itouch are beautiful and the pictures and songs work just fine of course  .
the ability to browse itunes from the comfort of my couch is awesome  .
i love being able to listen to 15 seconds of any song on itunes and then buy it if i want  .
the starbucks feature is cool too but i have not used it yet except when i is driving by a starbucks and got their internet connection and then the starbucks logo popped up , that is kinda cool  .
bottom line is this gadget is neat and cool to have  .
the touch screen features cannot be beat .
beautiful product , good interface  .
you are going to want to buy the ipod touch with macy on it  .
the one with corrine has troubles i hear  .
read on it at wikipedia .
sure , i listed space as a con , but you people have to understand that this is flash memory  .
at the time of this post , i don't believe there is another 16 gb flash player on the market  .
if you want a portable video device with a huge screen and a lot of space , buy the archos 605 wifi , which is freaking massive , by the way  .
apple obviously wanted to keep the touch sexy and sleek , and for that , they needed to use flash memory  .
there may be an updated touch in a few months with a 32 gb capacity ; i wouldn't expect anymore than that , though as for the features , they are amazing  .
i had never used an iphone before using this phone , but i had no idea that the touchflow is so amazing  .
i do wish i could turn the coverflow off , because i do not really use it , but that is also very intuitive safari is the most amazing mobile browser i have ever used , and i have used every browser for windows mobile 6 out there  .
it is fully functional (except for java and flash) and just awesome  .
however , it does crash sometimes , freezes , and stops music playback  .
just a heads up another big complaint i'm seeing is about ical appointments  .
get it through your thick skulls people   this is not a pda  .
it's a portable media player  .
again , if you're looking for an all    in    one device , look elsewhere  .
while i understand the frustration of apple taking out features from the ipod touch for no reason other than to give people a reason to still buy the iphone , if you really , really need programs like maps , you should buy a seperate pda  .
i have an htc hermes , with many features of the touch (touch screen , mp3 playback , web browser , etc) and use that for gps , calendar , phone , and whatever pda type things i need to use in conclusion , the ipod touch is a fantastic media player that everyone needs to at least check out .
i do not own an iphone and have never used one so based on my ownership of a mini , video and new nano (3g) this is the best ipod yet  .
i love the way the touch screen works typing in searches , etc  .
is really easy (easier than my blackberry)  .
very excited about it but so far not much to complain about  .
i know there are grumbles because no e    mail set up and some other iphone features  .
i don't really think i would use those features , so not as concerned as others ; however , if the software is modified to allow these functions , it would be great overall , i am happy i did not wait .
one of the best features of this phone is the web browser that works through a wi    fi server in its range  .
its as fast as your laptop  .
the special youtube browser lets your browse through all the featured and top videos on youtube  .
com and the video detail is just amazing  .
the music feature is obviously the main feature , it so nice and organized , it lets you browse your music by artist , song title , playlists , albums , genres , composers and also through cover flow just like in your itunes  .
other smaller features include a world clock , daily planner , contact info , calendar , calculator  .
it also lets you access your photo library and also buy music and movies from the itunes store  .
its an amazing product  .
why use a wheel from an older ipod , when you can just touch your music  .
i've had mine for several days an enjoy it imensly  .
great way to share my photos , check news via safari over wifi  .
i've not been much of a utube user but that's changed  .
the sound is excellent to my older ears  .
and for some reason it plays much , much better in my car fm device than my older ipod  .
i assume there's higher output volume  .
regardless , driving is a pleasure i've read lots of complaints about the metal back  .
seems fine to me if you exercise some care  .
as i read on one site in response to someone complaining about the back       hey dude , the ipod is a lot more fun if you look at the other side  .
my biggest issue is the lack of video output without an apple authorized device  .
but that's across the whole line  .
seems like a poor way to treat loyal customers who have invested $$ in video devices that are now obsolete  .
please apple , free the video .
i'll begin by stating that i had never owned an ipod before this one  .
i bought this portable media player mostly to entertain myself while traveling on subways , road trips , airplanes , etc  .
anywhere i have to sit for extended periods of time and i cannot be guaranteed that i will be entertained by anything else (which may include work , but , yeah)  .
i have a small flash    based creative mp3 player , which i use for audio because it's tiny and easy to manually organize and sturdy , so i don't really care about the features of itunes or having a huge memory capacity to store every song known to man  .
the 16gb capacity is more than enough to hold hours and hours of tv shows and movies , with enough left space left over for a few hours of music and dozens of photos (your choices and ratio of media may vary)  .
if you haven't tried the touch screen yet , you should go test it out on the demo model at your local apple store    it works surprisingly well , and it's kinda fun  .
i would have preferred a rocker button (i  .
a button that rocks like a teeter    totter , not necessarily a button for those about to rock) for volume control , but i'm adaptable  .
the wireless internet access is also a feature i find very useful (and it's implemented very well) , as it lets me surf the information superhighway (visualize me doing the bunny ears thing there) on a decent screen while i'm out and about  .
if the four    hundred dollar price tag is not too offensive to you , this is a well    implemented piece of hardware  .
i is waiting to compare this to the new creative zen media player , but i decided that the touch's bigger screen and wireless internet access trumped the zen's sd slot and compact size (also , i do not think the 16gb zen is available yet as of the time of this review , and i needed a media player asap) .
i had a gen 5  .
5 video ipod and upgraded to this  .
it has been well worth it  .
it is so easy to navigate to different screens , options , menus , etc alot of people complain about storage space , but it really depends on who you are  .
i have about 8gb left on mine after installing all i want on it  .
the touch screen works really well and it is very sensitive  .
buy it you will love it .
i bought a 16gb model the day this sucker came out and i have had no problems  .
i have had 3 ipods before this (2nd gen , 4th gen , nano) and this ipod takes the win  .
i cannot believe how easy it is to use  .
the flick to scroll feature is outstanding , cover flow is simply beautiful and safari is just the icing on the cake  .
wifi opens a whole new door  .
simply find a hotspot and you can download music on the fly , which works amazingly fast  .
i also like to have youtube for those long lecture classes and how the sleekness allows this ipod to be tucked away neatly  .
do not worry about jamming this into your pocket , the screen is almost bulletproof now on the downside , the stupid metal backing that is probably the softest element on earth is still present , i is hoping for the backing like the iphone had  .
also , steve thought it would be cool to give you a keyboard and only be able to type in contacts (uh for what  .
) , url's and search topics  .
you have a calendar but cannot type in appointments and the notes feature , which is totally useless before is now perfectly well adapted for this player , is gone  .
sigh so if you weigh the good and the bad , the ipod touch is definitely worth your money (or college refund check in my case)  .
cover flow is simply the best reason to buy this and the widescreen video player  .
people who are complaining about the camera seriously everyone has a phone with a camera on it use it i say this is the best $421  .
79 i ever spent .
the sound beats my old mp3 player by a mile  .
sounds incredible in my car using a cassette adapter  .
the earphones sound great , but fall out after about 10 seconds of use i've purchased the 8gb model and it's perfect for my needs great purchase , could not be happier .
like any 1st generation product , the touch is not absolutely perfect  .
but what it does , it does better than any other device out there  .
the only real competition for the touch is an iphone  .
compared to my samsung blackjack's web browser , the touch wins hands down i suspect that there will be many more applications available when the either the device gets hacked fairly soon or apple allows new applications to be added .
this is the best ipod ever  .
i personally bought it because of the glorious display and not because it's an iphone  .
i have used this thing for 3 days and it is such a chick magnet  .
this is a hell of a device  .
i hate 2 review sumthing i dont own , but will be buying one shortly i is really into the nanos , btw , theyre also amazing , but after using a touch today , theres no reason to get anything but the touch , except for price the multi    touch display is gorgeous  .
the ipod function works great , same with youtube  .
safari is amazing , i would never expect that great of quality of anything on a device this small its crazy thin , too safari worked very well , the keyboard i find easy to use , but for other will just take a little bit of time to get used to one problem is the lack of a physical buttons but is it really that big of a deal  .
i dont think so  .
there soo much fun to use and if u dont want an iphone this is clearly the way to go grreat job apple  .
i got exactly what i wanted in the ipod touch  .
an excellent video and music player give it a shot .
i really want thins ipod but i is wondering if the istore option worked outside the u  .
greatest ipod for entertainers  .
its pricey but what can you expect flash memory cost alot of money , but this thing its really nice , but iphone its a better choice if you had to choose  .
i love this ipod  .
true , it's not perfect  .
my main complaint is that it's only 16 gb , but that is flash , so it's better quality  .
video looks great , and the bigger screen really makes a difference  .
i love having the cover flow , and when i tried the wi    fi in a hot spot the other day , surfing the web is a breeze  .
a real pleasure to use , and just a good looking product  .
i'm sure the next gen will be even better  .
everyone who loved the iphone but didnt like the contract is on the edge of their seats at the recent event  .
well apple delivers with this new device  .
looks amazing and is very thin  .
has all the great features from the iphone in terms of the entertainment such as wi    fi , safari , youtube and the new itunes wireless store  .
superb screen and amazing touch display we all love from the iphone  .
comes in 8gb to 16gb , yes it isnt huge but i'm pretty sure that we all create playlists right  .
personally 16gb is more than enough for me  .
i love the new ipod touch  .
it is exactly what i is looking for  .
i dont usually want my whole music library with so the capacity fit my purposes very well  .
i have loaded a movie , along with some recent photos and some of my favorite music and i have much more space left to use for additional content  .
i highly recommend to anyone  .
the safari browser works great  .
i only wish that it had adobe flash capabilities  .
i am curious what they do with future software updates .
sure i don't have it yet but i do not have to be a genius to see that apple knows what their doing  .
the first ipod had only a capacity of 5 gigs , now there's one that has 160 gigs  .
the amount of songs that you will be able to put on this device will increase over the years , history shows it  .
i is disappointed to when i found out about the lack of space  .
when you get tired of a group of songs on your ipod , switch them out with another play list , problem solved .
this is possibly the best ipod ever  .
want to get one for free  .

com/index  .
php  .
ref  4073810  .
i obviously do not own my yet so i'll have to update when i get it but for now it is 16gb because its a flash player not a hard disk  .
for anyone that has had a hard disk drive go bad in 13 months just after the warrenty is up and prefer flash , 16gb is a welcome change .
first i'd like to tackle storage  .
for me , i don't ever need to carry more than 16 gig of anything around with me  .
it is a portable device , i cannot imagine you can watch/listen to everything this will hold in a couple of days  .
my 30 gig video has about 8 gig in just over a year (including videos , how many times can you watch the same one  .
i find myself listening to the same music most of the time  .
it is 16 gig because that is the maximum config of flash memory available  .
flash    better reliability , no skipping , and thin  .
will there be a newer , bigger , better one  .
yes , and another after that  .
as technology evolves , products improve i is so disappointed when the iphone came out because it required you switch to at t  .
i'm not a big fan and therefore did not buy one  .
now i can have all the best the iphone has to offer in the touch  .
once the iphone has gotten most of the bugs worked out and is opened up to other networks i'll possibly get one then  .
until then , i will be one of the first adopters of this beautiful little device and will see a newer , better , possibly less expensive version come out in several months (i bet i'll still be just as happy with mine though) .
on the couch , watching tv  .
browse nytimes  .
com , nfl trivia , anything  .
forget the music until later .
for everyone without an iphone (really if you have an iphone and want one of these , you really must have a spending problem) and just wanted an mp3 player , then i would get this  .
many people on cnet posting their comments are upset about a couple of things  .
first , the storage (8 or 16 gm flash)  .
flash is the simplest way to sum it up (it is superior to hard drives ; only con so far is storage space)  .
16 gb is so far the highest capacity available anywhere for flash and it has a few advantages over hard drive models  .
first , no moving parts which makes it 100% skip free unlike hard drive models which have spinning disks  .
second , flash has faster loading times (overall speed is greater) and with flash , you can devices almost any size you want because since flash is so small , you can do many things with it (hence the thiness of the ipod touch)  .
also , there are less techincal problems with devices that use flash over hard drives (you are more likely to experience problems with hard drives than flash memory)  .
yes , while 16 gb seems small , to many people it may not  .
depending on how deep your music library is or depending on how many videos you play to keep on it , 16 gb may be sufficent for many like me  .
i have over 200 albums (most full) and i'm not hitting 10 gb yet  .
that goes to show it holds quite alot  .
at $399 it may seem like alot , but think about the whole product as a whole , and also remember that flash techonolgy is expensive ; the price is a bargin  .
other neat things is that it has blazing fast wi    fi (way faster than dsl which is fast enough lol) , new itunes wi    fi store (very convient) , and other stuff  .
overall this tops the ipod line as the best and over the next couple of years , this is going to be the standard for ipods  .
why a rating of 9 out of 10   no products are perfect and thats because (common sense)   everything man made always has its flaws (meaning never 100% perfect) .
this is the best ipod to date  .
people might say it has too little memory but its the most available for flash type memory at the time  .
it has an amazing display and none of the iphone problems  .
i have been waiting for an ipod update for quite a while now , and with the release of the ipod touch and the ipod classic all my wishes have been fulfilled  .
but , i have been left in the middle    i crave for the storage capacity of the classic while i want the features of the touch i wonder if we will ever see a convergence  .
till it happens i think i will have to make do with the 16gb of the touch .
overall this is what people wanted out of the ipod from the very beginning  .
granted the price for the 16gb is high but if you think about it , its the same price as the 8gb iphone (your sacrificing for more storage)  .
remember people this is a flash drive not a normal moving parts hard drive like most ie  .
archos  .
this is the right foot for people who wanted the iphone's ipod features and web browser but not having to be connected to at t for 2 years  .
for me once i get this i'll have the best of both worlds (a blackberry curve and an ipod touch)  .
remember we're talking about solid state hard drives (flash drives) not your typical hard drive  so stop complaining about the size of the storage (we can complain about that when solid state drives get cheaper hehe)  .
ive had several ipod products , but the one i is looking forward to most is this  .
if price is not a major influence on your decision i would recommend this  .
space is also a problem for some , but it has many good applications  .
i would suggest extending your warranty  .
with mine the back light went out after about 8 months (luckily it is still under warranty and apple gave me a brand new one free of charge  .
but it could happen anytime)  .
in short this product is great  .
nice features and simple to use make it a nice addition to the apple family  .
bottom line this device sounds great to my ears , looks great to my eyes , works great to my fingers and is my favorite little device  .
when i don't need to use a computer to do a task it's great i pay bills email chat facebook twitted game listen to music youtube and everything on this device  .
the only trouble i've had is wiring this review has not gone well  .
never the less it's a great little device , well worth my $250 .
i have had mine for about two months now  .
i think the price per gb is nuts  .
i purchased the 16 gb and would have loved to go for the 32 i just couldnt let myself shell out over five hundred bucks  .
other then that i love it and play with it a lot , tons of games and programs for it in the istore .
i love it i spend 20 hours with it , a day i recommend upgrading the earbuds imo price not a issue the 32 gb version is the best mp3 player out there .

Looks Appealing, Preforms as stated, Size, Multiple Funcations.; Size is limited, Price, Prone to fingerprints and back gets scratched easily if that bothers you.
Extremely reactive to touch, doesnt turn on in my pocket by accident. Beautiful coverflow; None yet that I have found.
The Best iPod interface, Safari Browser, and officially the Widescreen edition; Price, No Bluetooth??
nice screen most memory it can have wi-fi; price and battery life
Great Screen, fun interface, best web browser; no bluetooth (for now), need to be able to add more apps
Touch screen, good sound quality, web browsing, fast Wi-Fi, rugged.; Takes a while to turn on.
Touch Screen, WiFi Store, and all other features of the iPhone without the horrbile phone part!; Unknown until shipped!
What a touch screen should be; Would like it to be bigger than 32GB
beutifull display and lovely enterface that you have fun choosing the song with the album art; low cappasity and if hacked voids warnety from apple and stores i belive
Friendly user interface; big screen; easy wireles connectivty; Already see a dead pixel; back side of case quickly gets dirty and scratched; wish hard drive was larger
Beautiful unit, plenty of storage for my needs, doesn't require activation with AT&#38;T, WIFI built in.; None that I can think of.
Big, beautiful screen; touch interface works well; wi-fi internet works well; enough storage for hours of video; Heavier than you might expect; expensive; no expansion slot; doesn't cure cancer
touch screen, WI-FI, Safari browser, thin and beautiful design; price, video could have been better
ease of use and wifi; none found - would be nice if it had built in speakers
Beautiful and responsive touch screen, iTunes synchchronization, quick and easy music browsing, Safari, Apple support (constant updates), very thin and sturdy; High price tag
WiFi Internet Capability, Video, Music, and much more; Only 2 cons: WiFi limits the Web to 'hot zones' and bigger hard drive space would be nice
cool interface, amazingly thin for all it does, wi-fi; no fm radio, streaming radio sites don't appear to work on it, set up a little tricky
Compared to my PalmPDA it is like night and day; The keyboard takes getting used to - maybe because I'm used to a stylus. (The keyboard is intuitive and tries to help.) Sometimes difficult to find a WiFi connection.
Touch interface, screen, web browser, quality, refinement, and so much more...; Storage space, supplied ear-buds, but still warrants a 10
Excellent interface, battery life and durability; Lacks the software of the iPhone. Has to be hacked.
Everything.. Touch screen. Can easily adjust volume and change song when doing other things on the touch; Small keys (but it automatically corrects so it's not that bad). Screen, and the back scratch easily.. Wifi connectivity is sensitive
Gorgeous screen, touc display from the iPhone, Wi-Fi, thin, lightweight; Chrome back, lack of some features, memory may be a problem for some users
Awsome Sound Quality, You can load Mp3s, Apps And Games, watch video in mp4 format. Its real thin and light. Greatest thing since sliced bread!!! The touch sensitivity is great and accurate.; None at all because well i got it free!!!!!
great picture quality, very cool to have, safari browser is good; a little pricey but worth it, I wish they made it bigger in capacity size
Touch Screen Interface, WIFI Internet, 16 GB capacity, Professional appearance, Syncs with ease, Battery Performance; Takes a very long time to power-up, Password required to change volume or pause music, must hold the Power button for a long time to power off, then you must slide to confirm
The "iPhone" style design, the great video and (obviosly) music performance and the amazing internet Wi-Fi conection!; The memory capacity (16GB) iS excellent for me, but not for the other iPod lines.
Innovative touch screen, beautiful looks, seamless integration with iTunes, video looks much better than conventional iPod, doesn't scratch like the iPod classic; Smudge magnet on screen, screen appears blury when using safari at times
touch screen, wifi, youtube; nothing, unless you use it with dirty hands, then there are some finger prints. but it is easy to clean.
useful wifi and its real thin and pretty; i would have love that mail would be included, but its not ment to be a PDA
everything you could POSSSSIBLY want in an iPod. verry good quality media, YOUTUBE!, surf the web too i mean wow.; ok i want more than 16GB but its perfectly understandable, the reason for not including Google Maps and email is stupid
It's sleek, fast, cool and just plain awesome.; If you have giant music library, this product might not be for you since the max memory it holds is 16 GB
I like the fact that if you have a wireless connection you can access your e-mail on it..and myspace and facebook.; i do not like how the 1st generation does not have the volume control on the side.
Great product - user interface, Internet browser, video quality and overall usability; Not much, maybe I would like a docking stand for the price
Interface is top of the line, great screen, best touch screen I have ever used, battery life is better than expected, apple quality product.; No dedicated volume button.
Marvellous machine, touch system works flawlewssly, movies, pictures are really nice especially considering the diminutive size of the screen, the sound is excellent with both my sennheiser and akg he; A HISS, annoying considering the high quality in the execution and design of this MP3 player.
Great UI internet/overall speed faster than my mom's 01 dell, completely amazing; no blind navigation(touchscreen) can use some more apps from apple maybe, like mail, weather, etc. why do i have to get a hack to get all of that when it works just fine?
I've had mine for several days an enjoy it imensly. Great way to share my photos, check news via Safari over WiFi. I've not been much of a Utube user but that's changed. The sound is excellent to my o; No comprehensive instructions--have to play to learn. No video output.
touch screen works perfect, safari, youtube, audio sounds much better then my last two mp3 players.; Having to use the itunes program to do anything with it. Unable to use it as a usb type file holder. Minor problem as I have memory sticks for that.
This item is awesome..similar to an Iphone but witout the phone! the touch is easy to use and makes scrolling for music simple. The Wi-Fi is nice to have as well!; Wifi nice to have but only works close to a source. Screens drag sometimes.
It has a great touch screen like the iphone. It also uses the same OS wich is great for writing programs (when the SDK comes out); Although Apple just recently announced a 32GB iPod, I still require a little more memory for movies and music. It has no disk mode. Great browser but needs flash support.
Beautiful screen, easy to care for, excellent sound, easy interface, excellent browser, doesn't feel like an ipod (IMO) and many more...; Limited memory if you have more than 16GB of music (I still haven't filled it though)
touch screen is nice and easy to use, easy to turn off, placement of buttons is nice too; its kind of akward to hold, not recomended for people with arthritis because of how wide it is, battery life is a little short
Fast and reliable web browser, loads of features, good video quality, good music quality, sleek design and light too, easy to use interface, very intuitive and sensitive touch screen.; Smudges are easily attracted, WIFI is not as receptive as some other wireless devices, price is still somewhat high, batteery life is somewhat short.
The interface is fantastic! I love the multi touch screen; its easy to use and have great features like safari, cover flow, video playback etc.; It can get annoying to have to reach into your pocket every time you want to change songs; cant add new events in the calender; no bluetooth
Amazing sized screen for watching videos, Safari and Browsers (Of course). All the games and applications that are available to you. Fits in your pocket well to top it off.; When you have too many applications (58 in my case), it tends to get a little slow. But, beside that, there is nothing I don't like about this gem.
The iPod Touch is like having a mini computer in my pocket. I love having all my music on ipod, and watching movies on it. Being able to get on the web is good. Quite a few places have free Wi-Fi. And the APPs, so many good ones to choose from.; IF THE GLASS BREAKS!! APPLE told me not only would I have to have glass replaced but they said the inside had to be replaced even though the iPod still works. THEY want me to shell out $249 just to have it fixed.
