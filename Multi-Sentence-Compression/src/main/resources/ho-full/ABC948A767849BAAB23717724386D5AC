i stayed five nights at a g suite , which despite the price segment is not as high up the tower as i prefer my rooms to be .
nonetheless , the views are good and the 88 sqm are nice split , with a sizeable bathroom and separate walk-in shower .
the fact that a recent refurb has overpainted everything in white , can not deceive that most of the fittings are somewhat dated .
what good is the party zone , if the iphone/ipod connectivity is limited to iphone4 .
the request to get an adapter to enable my iphone 6 connected to the in-suite sound system could not be matched .
the bed is extremely comfortable and facing full sized city view windows , is a comfortable start to a long stay in bangkok .
the staff at the exec level is trying hard and is very keen to please , making the stay very enjoyable .
however , in high times , the kitchen and drink service are ill-prepared for the volume of club visitors .
this is not helped by opening the exec lounge to additional walk-in guests ( who pay extra ) , but are not part of the original capacity/use calculation .
worst is the experience when one actually leaves the lofty heights of the club , to join the regular guests at the larger main breakfast restaurant .
the queues for tables and the inability to supply enough food ( replenish ) and clean tables , was substantially transparent and is clearly a management issue .

the same can be experienced with the pool and the fitness centre - all facilities are overcrowded and in ill proportion for the number of guests accommodated at the hotel.
