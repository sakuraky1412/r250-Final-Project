Pros:. Yahoo! Widgets (Pandora Internet Radio, Ebay, YouTube, etc.), plenty of inputs, stream content from your PC, built-in and downloadable content, ability to update firmware directly from TV, incredible picture, reduced glare effect.. 
Cons:. Widgets can be quirky at times, most likely bugs to be worked out.. 
Summary:. I was able to find this Plasma for $934 at Frys Electornics before Christmas '09. Their everyday price is $1400. If you are in the market for a large flat panel television that has tons of great features, excellent picture quality, and won't break the bank, look no further. I have not noticed a big problem with glare either. It is in a fairly well lit room with two big picture windows, and I only close the blinds on the closest one at certain points in the day. I have the same issue with my LCD in the other room. Don't be fooled by all the gimmicky catch phrases like 240Hz and 80,000 MP Dynamic Contrast with the LCD/LED TVs. Plasmas are 600Hz and 2,000,000 MegaPixels Dymanic Contrast by default. And the average cost difference in power usage is $1 a month. Woopdeedoo! $12 a year. As an added bonus, if you have certain types of Samsung cellphones, you can send messages directly to the TV. Don't ask me how it works, but that is pretty sweet!.

Pros:. Picture quality is great.. Blacks are reproduced exceptionally well.. Touch of color is subtle and smart.. Menus are intuitive.. Plenty of connections.. Easy to wall mount (weight).. 
Cons:. Small bits of image retention in first 100-300 hours of life. (Goes away quickly and nothing permanent.). 
Summary:. This is an exceptionally well designed TV and the price is exceptional. People tend to forget about plasmas. They have the BEST picture quality available right now. LED still suffers from ghosting and motion blur which are incredibly distracting. This plasma has a very natural look and movies look exactly how they should in the theater especially with 24p on blu-ray(no artifical plastic looking images and artificial frame rate bumping). Another plus is you can get this for very cheap compared to others. I got this for LESS then 1000! You can't find any comparable tv across any brand for that amount including Samsungs own LCD models. I own a 42 inch plasma tv from Samsung from year 2006. This 50 inch plasma is lighter, better quality, and uses less energy and produces less heat! My old tv had some burn in in the first 100-200 hours but it seems more prone to it. This plasma gets rid of it quickly and it doesn't stay around very long. Additionally, my 42 inch had a buzz that was significantly louder then this 50. Yes this tv is almost 10 inches bigger and it weighs less and it's quieter. It's also thinner. This looks great on the wall! It's just a bit thicker then the PN50B850 series. It's thinner then LCD tvs (exception of LED's).. I play games, watch movies, and watch tv. I do it all. I don't have any fear of image retention. They reccomend you take it easy in the first 400 hours of life. I did this by watching the static images and change channel every now and then on 4:3 ratio programming. I hardly went "easy" on the set though.. I'd reccomend this tv to anyone that wants TRUE blacks, no motion blur, and a very versatile set for the money. It's the best bang for your buck right now!!!.

Pros:. Great picture, even out of the box.. Easy to and many picture tweaks.. Great looking, touch of color.... real class!. Burn-in function and scrolling.. Beautiful colors and deep blacks.. Definition is outstanding.. Excellent refresh rate.. 
Cons:. Cons: Putting the set in the stand a little demanding, but of course, I'm an old man. Put the panel on two chairs with a large gap in the center and have a third person slip the stand on and tighten down.. 
Summary:. I've owned a 50" Panasonic Plasma since 2005, it was CNet's Editors Choice. Gave it to my son. I wanted to check out the 1080p, Cinema Smooth, Internet Widgets and I wasn't disappointed... I've been building computers since 1988 and I do my homework when it comes to electronics and attention to detail. I've read all the reviews by customers, CNet, Consumer Report on all three brands. They all have their issues, but in my opinion, Samsung wins out in every respect and for the money, Panasonic doesn't have a chance.. First issue I want to address is buzzing. No buzzing at all! Once again, no buzzing at all!! I know Samsung addresses the issue on their website, but it's a non-issue. If you put your ear to the top of the vent, you can hear the fan. The folks who have complained about the loud buzzing, you need to return the unit for another, you have a lemon. But if you check, there are a heck of a lot of people with not issue compared to those who have.. Now to another issue, Burn-in. The first thing you do with any plasma set is TURN DOWN THE CONTRAST. No matter what mode you select the contrast is in the 90s. I cut the contrast down to 45/55, brightness 55/65, color 45, and turn on Burn Protection. You can brings those up as hours accumalate. The other tweaks to your liking. After the burn-in period, knock yourself out!. The Cinema Smooth 1080p/24, no glitches I have noticed. Blu-ray is outstanding and SD is very good. The Internet feature works great with plenty of Widgets, etc. What you do need, unless you hardwire is the Samsung WIS-08BG2X Wireless Link stick, plug it in the USB port on the side, go to the Internet option, select wireless, type in the WEP ID off your modem and your are ready to surf. But if you are looking for some serious surfing, use your computer/laptop. Believe me, you will love this plasma! Hope this helps in your decision, take care..

Pros:. 50" size is perfect, lower price than comparable sized LCD TVs. Samsung quality. Nice picture quality. Four v1.3 HDMIs, usb input. 
Cons:. the screen is tinted pink/rose.. remote isn't universal and is relatively long &#38; big. Still eats a bit more power than other TVs its size. The top rear corners kick off some heat. No SD card input. Lacks 2 tuner PIP.. 
Summary:. I don't mind that they chose to give the frame a "touch of color" with the red tint, but I wish they didnt need to tint the screen itself. This doesnt really effect the colors when watching TV but you can definitely notice it during the day in the reflections. Daytime viewing can be difficult if you don't darken the room. I got a great deal on this set, sub 1K tag w/ free delivery so I cant complain too much. I expect the TV to last me 10-15 years until I decide to jump into a more affordable LED backlit LCD or possibly OLED.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Price, Great Picture, NO BUZZING, Lots of ports for connectivity. 
Cons:. Haven't tried watching a Blu-Ray movie on it yet so I don't know if the Cinema Smooth issue got fixed with the update I just got. Other then that possible issue there are none.. 
Summary:. I compared this tv side by side with the TC-P50G10 and there was no doubt the Samsung was superior. It was less expensive, delivered better colors, and I thought it's black were darker. I'll admit I was concerned with all the talk about buzzing, but I haven't heard a thing. Save yourselves some money, skip over the skinny 850's and the Panisonics and buy a 650 you won't be sorry..

Pros:. Excellent PQ, Affordable. 
Cons:. Slight glare. Sounds is just ok.. 
Summary:. After looking for months for a 50"+ tv i went plasma and chose the Samsung PN50B650. Picture quality is outstanding. Great for sports and gaming. Lots of display options allow you to set it up for different lighting scenarios.. There can be a slight glare during some scenes but it's not to bad. The sound is ok. I use 5.1 so it's not a problem. I don't hear any buzz coming from mine like i read in other reviews. I havent seen any burn-in or image retention watching ESPN networks for hours upon hours.. For the price this TV is outstanding. Picked up at Best Buy for a little over $1000. It was as cheap as the PN50B550 that day..

Pros:. Deep blacks. Rich colors. Lots of adjustments. Beautiful picture. Low price..
