this camera is ujust overall a 10 in my mind  .
the picture color might be plain but it can hold about 10000 photos and can last you forever  .
with it ive made thousands of videos over the 2 years ive had it , videos from skateboarding to basketball to even walking with friends  .
i love it and if there is a camera to buy this would be the one  .
i have had 2 other hard drive cameras in the last 2 months jvc and the dcr    sr40 both had poor image quality and disappointed me for the price they cost  .
but the dcr    sr80 has a great image even on a 70 hd widescreen  .
this is a great camera  .
ok , here is what i needed  .
compact camcorder , hardrive (tapes and dvd suck)and some type of still photos i have had this camera for two months  .
i have recorded on a roller coaster , on my bicycle and some plain old stand and shoot  .
no problems at all  .
very good video quality  .
i use adobe premiere elements to do my editing , no problems  .
it is a little tricker to upload video , but what do you expect , it's video  .
do not listen to the whiners it's a good camera  .
ok for those of you shopping around and looking for that new camcorder  .
this is perfect for the average or above average person to record home movies , i repeat movies  .
if you want great pictures buy a digital camera with 3  .
1 pixels or more  .
the camera does have the ability to shoot stills at 1meg and well it is not the greatest  .
look if you want some phenomenal camera that shoots great pictures and movies then be prepared to pay $1 , 000 or more  .
if you want a camera to record those great moments with your family well this is it  .
take the time to read the manual and the instructions and you will find the many things you can do with the camcorder  .
the easy button is perfect for the family who has the spouse who is not a techy and does not want to full around with the manual controls  .
the movies that you burn play well in the dvd player  .
if you are expecting a picture like the movies that you buy well not happening and i dont think they make that type of camera yet  .
for the price and not having to buy mini dvd discs that record 20 to 30 minutes at high quality and or buying a rewritable mini dvd which you then will load onto you drive and then onto normal dvd which i might ad the video will degraded a little , or do you buy this camera and have the ability to record up to 14 hours in high quality or 41 hours of regular play  .
you make the decision and i am extremely happy with my choice .
i is going to get the dcr    sr100 but its more expensive and less memory so i got this one with more memory  .
i looked at both models in a store and the iamge is the same so i got this one  .
the other one only cost more i think because of more megapixels , better image qulity , and zoom  .
this is outstanding camcorder for home use very decent picture quility for single 1/5  .
5 chip  .
sr100 vs s80 is same video quility difference only is sr100 is 3mega pixel photes sr 80 is 1 mega pixel only .
bought at circuit city on sale for $639  .
nice to not worry about tapes  .
picture quality is good , but a little less than i expected from sony  .
the lines are fairly smooth on my panasonic 480i plasma  .
but colors are not rendered as well as from my sony high 8 camcorder (all indoor images so far)  .
zoom is surprisingly adequate  .
i caught a blue heron eating a fish from about 60 yards  .
camera is light and compact  .
touch screen does get full of prints       could use a stylus  .
the 55min battery seems a bit small  .
since your buying this camera so that you do not need to carry around media , why do you want to pack an extra batteries  .
fp 90 battery available at amazon for $64  .
do not buy a generic battery  .
the sony batteries last well and i've had generics fry a digital camera , they are temptingly cheap but do not do it  .
sound quality is excellent  .
when the baby cries on the video my wife runs into the wrong room very easy to use overall a very good camera , if you are expecting perfect video on a 55 inch screen buy an hd camera , and enjoy the collection of $16 20 minute tapes  .
the covenience of this and overall performance (picture , sound , zoom and ease of operation) makes it the right choice for us .
i got this camcorder in sept  .
2006  .
so far it has been bounced around the trunk of my car , withstood near freezing temps as well as direct sunlight  .
i use it to record youth soccer games  .
the focus tracks very quickly i am not comfortable yet framing video via the display  .
when filming outside with the sun at your back , the display can wash out  .
i sun shield would alleviate this issue video is very good and the corder is easy to use  .
i use the control on the top of the camcorder to adjust the zoom , not the touch screen for the most part , sony got this one right  .
if it had a viewfinder , i would bump it up to a 9 .
this is my first hd based video camcorder , i picked because i could not find the sr    100 at circuitcity , i believe camcorders that carry sony's name should be better  .
1) after all , it is a single ccd camcorder  .
hole accumulation diode is misleading  .
it means nothing but accumulation of charge (charge coupling  .
) and nothing much 2) i shot indoor under incandescent yellow light  .
video is not great but it may appear satisfactory to some eyes  .
you wo not be treated with a hollywood dvd movie quality footage (those are classic analog tape cameras)  .
blue noise appears all over the dark areas i  .
blue dancing pixels  .
you need more ccds to acquire light and color info otherwise it is a tough task to eliminate it 3) i took videos in the evening light  .
another good test for camcorders  .
the colors came out soft and lacked vibrancy  .
the edges looked bit blurry to my eyes as well 4) in bright morning and afternoon sunlight , the video quality is better than above two scenarios  .
the colors look better and the sharpness improves slightly 5) those are the limitations and cannot be overlooked/belittled as we are paying 800 dollars (just for the hard disk space which we do not need to be frank)  .
had they given us just 20gb of space and fit 3 c  .
, this would have won titles  .
so we still do not have a hard disk based 3 ccd camcorder for 800 dollars  .
minidv rocks but just when it comes to quality  .
so , pure quality lovers    sony dcr    hc96 minidv    800 dollars again  .
6) the good sides of this camcorder    easy to use  .
i do not mind the touch screen interface  .
nice feature set  .
they did not overload it with features which is a good thing in a way  .
the night plus vision greys out eyes and gives a greenish ir touch to the video but that is the way it is supposed to work  .
it works well in total dark but delays focusing  .
hard disk space is nice so you can keep on shooting without downloading  .
but i do not see a need really  .
lightweight and ergonomic enough but feels a bit plastic  .
lcd is big enough to work your way through the shoot and lastly , just above average video quality .
you can spend less and get the same or more , but if do not like the hassle of tape , minidvds etc  .
, you'll like this  .
thoug they could have done better with the transfer/image software .
this camcorder is not apple    mac friendly i only found this out after opening the box list of issues/problems    .
usb connection , instead of firewire    imovie does not recogize camcorders that are not firewire  .
had to download 'mpeg streamclip' to output dv files  .
(thanks scott simons  .
) http  //www  .
squared5  .
com/  .
had to purchase quicktime 'mpeg2' codec for $23  .
00 , but still do not hear sound when previewing in quicktime  .
any suggestions  .
i am using quicktime 7+  .
i hear sound when using 'mpeg streamclip' , but no sound when playing in quicktime 7+pro    low still picture quality    there may be more issues with this camera  .
these comments are after only owning the cam for under 2 hours  .
the upside is    .
60 gb harddrive  .
quiet easy to organize in playback menu  .
(i wish there is a way to re    name movie files within the menu)  .
very light and comfortable    expandable , can add a flash , microphone , etc    very simple and great for novice users this is my first camcorder  .
i am a record commercial audio producer/composer/engineer and wanted to document some of my sessions  .
i feel that i spent too much more for a camcorder that should have 'firewire' and should be mac friendly  .
i also assumed that for the price there would be more options/effects , but that is ok considering what i will be using the product for i just read some of the jvc everio reviews (the other 'hard    drive' choice in this price range) and it seems like their users are encountering similar problems i am having with the sony  .
although , they seem not as happy with their video quality  .
i think i made the right choice over the jvc  .
it will be intersting to see how quickly this 'hard    drive' camera will outdated , considering it is a first    year for consumer 'hard    drive' cameras hope this helps ,  .

the only convinient thing i found about this camera is the ease of use and the transfer speed to the computer via usb and craddle  .
i spected at least to have better recording quality than my old trv133  .
lots of blue pixels show up in black areas and low light recordings  .
i guess they're saving their advanced recording quality for the hd camcorders .
after i bought this , i went out to shoot fall colors somewhere in the mid west and it came out really bad  .
the colors does not look natural and the still pictures are not good either  .
and i shot all this in easy mode the indoors are a problem too i didnot expect this level of quality from a $800 piece  .
i am guessing sr    40 and sr    60 would be no different .
while i like the touch screen and the many hours the large harddrive can hold , there are more problems for me than it is worth at $799  .
the lack of a viewfinder became a huge problem when recording outdoor sports  .
the lcd just does not do the job when there is alot of action to follow , and it's washed    out with ambient light  .
the time and date is a viewable option when reviewing in the camera/lcd screen or when going out with analog , but when the files are transferred digitally , the time and date diappear  .
according to sony engineers there is no option to retain the time and date in a digital transfer  .
therefore i can transfer the files via the analog cables then capture it in a pinnacle usb box to be transferred back to digital and all for $800  .
wow , why did i buy a digital camcorder  .
another problem with the sony and pinnacle compatiblity is that when the files are transferred digitally , and moved into pinnacle , the sounds gets delayed and by the end of 90 mintutes it is 30 seconds or more behind  .
the ccn 1 meg , falls short of the 3 meg ccn other similiar camcorders espcially the models with 3 ccn's  .
similiar models have 20x optical zooms , and better lenses  .
so why did i buy this model , i is baited by the large harddrive  .
how much is it that worth  .
i am going to take it back and get my account credited even though the restocking fee is $150  .
it is better to make a $150 mistake than live with a $800+ , (extra batter , maint  .
contract , etc  .
) one  .
wait for a better model and cures to the software or solve some of the problems with the dcr    sr100 model  .
ok , it is not a high    end model , but you should get what you pay for at least .
camera is great , no problems there  .
no firewire port  .
to import to a mac you will need to spend an additional $45    100 for programs to convert video to work with imovie  .
sony never mentions this until after you have opened the box  .
if you have a mac avoid the sony hard drive camcorders .
i own this camera for over 6 months now  .
it comes with really weak software to bridge this camera with pc via usb  .
i got sony laptop with xp pro (pcg    k12p) after installing imagemixer for hdd camcorder (provided with this model) my windows explorer and all other applications dependent on dvd drive lost access to dvd writer  .
this software is really pece of arte  .
even uninstall didn't fix the problem  .
called sony support    waist of time  .
they blame everyone but them selfs ;  .
you wouldn't be able to watch recorded videos in windows media player  .
it chokes  .
sony support says it's microsoft's problem i took this camcorder to dominican republic for my vacation trip  .
it turns out camcorder cannot handle too much sun  .
dominican sun makes this camera worthless  .
picture turns completely white in the areas where sun is reflected camcorder is very small , some times you need to hold it with support by your other hand , and when you do that , i'm sure , you will cover microphones i have not found a video    stabilizer there  .
does not exist night shot feature is another horrible thing available on camcorder  .
if you want to see vampires    flip the switch  .
i have never seen anything like this  .
this option can only be used in horror movies  .
i cannot believe some people find this a useful feature  .
camera 1 megapixel  .
what a joke  .
carl zeis optics    and useless picture camera by the way , if you try to get an upgrade or next version of the imagemixer for hdd camcorder it's available from pixella side for 30$  .
i wander if it's any better than what the camcorder comes with  .
but i will not try that  .
i spent enough money on this camcorder  .
i waisted many hours trying to adopt this work    of    art by sony and i cannot  .
honestly    sony hardware is and still is an excellent quality , but software is always a disaster  .
think twice before you buy any sony product with third    party software .
i is recommended this camcorder by a friend who is a photographer with the washington post i paid nearly $800  .
00 dollars for the camcorder and after two month's of owning it the charger went bad  .
sony is very hesitant in honoring the warranty on it and demanded that i pay for shipping and handling to send in the broken charger  .
today i learned that after 10 days of shipping in the charger they had not received it  .
i have had from a sony trinitron tv to a sony vcr , dvd , home stereo , car radio and sony digital camera  .
but today is the last straw sony lost me as a loyal customer  .
i could of had purchase a canon camcorder for less money and with better customer service  .
i do not recommend sony products to anyone .
this is the worst consumer electronics items i have ever owned  .
i had a sony hi    8 digital camcorder that is 6 years old that stopped working , so i received this soonthereafter as a gift  .
i think i am going to get the old camcorder fixed i have 6 months of video on this camera but i have no way to get it out  .
now the lcd screen is not working and now i have no idea how to get the videos out the instructions for burning a dvd are bad it tells you to disconnect everything , start the computer , add everything , and oh disconnect all the other usb connections  .
not good i would not buy this product line  .
hopefully they have improved it .
purchased the sony dcr    sr80 on 11/25/06  .
on 11/29/06 my husband touched the lcd screen to show me what he had taped and the lcd screen completely shattered  .
its a touch screen , you have to touch it to control what you want the camera to do  .
best buy was not any help , they told me i had to contact sony  .
sony told me i must pay to send my camcorder to them and that they would determine if it is an accident or manufactures defect  .
if it is not covered under the warranty it will cost around $250  .
00 to repair  .
yeah right  .
sony will not get another dime off of me  .
sony had the nerve to ask me how hard is the screen touched  .
is it pushed lightly or really hard  .
i paid $750  .
00 for this camcorder , had it for four days , do the seriously think that i would purposely damage the screen  .
do not buy this camcorder  .
so i'm sure more technically savy people already know this , but i did not find out until after about 15 hours of recording that i cannot download this to my mac to use this with a mac you cannot use imovie and have to get a third party software  .
the software recommended in the manual comes from some company with no phone number or contact information on their site and costs $153 i wish i could share my chat session with customer service here if you would like to see it i've posted to my blog www  .

uggh  .
i'm giving this a 1 because of it's complete incompatibility with my existing software and hardware .
No DVD's or Tapes to buy; No through the lens View Finder
60gig Harddrive; Not Mac/iMovie Friendly, USB Connection instead of Firewire, Paid for additional software/codecs to work with iMovie :(, MPEG2
Ease of use, quality video; Very difficult to import into a Macintosh
Good picture, easy to use.; Poor sound, even with an add-on microphone.
60 Gig hard drive, no tapes mini dvd to buy, what more could you ask for.; Have not found one yet, but will repost if I found one.
Large harddrive, good size, easy to use.; fair picture quality, no view finder,
Simple to use, No need of lugging around tapes or DVDR's, Transfer speed from camcorder to computer; Recording quality, Price, Still shots are very grany, No Viewfinder.
Small size. Hard drive holds a lot and I mean it. Sound recorded in excellent quality.; Audio/Video compatibility. Software it comes with is a disaster! White balance has some serious issues.
Nice feature set yet easy to use, light weight, 60GB storage space (ain't a pro as you won't use it all up anyway); Blue noise in dark areas (indoor), colors smoothed out if not exactly washed out (outdoor)
Big disk, fast response and easy to use; Low light video and image quality is not that good
Its light, easy to use, i love how when i pull it out everyones amazed at the touch screen and compacity of the camera, and i love how its simple enough that you dont even have to read the manual its just right there!; The picture color isn't as amazing as it could be.
