Pros:. Best Games, Great Controlles, Sleek Design, Online Play. 
Cons:. Online Play, Weakest of the 3,. 
Summary:. The Playstation 2 is really the best console from 2000-2006. This mighty console has had most 3rd party support, meaning they got the most games. The console has gotten mostly every major franchise in one way or another. The only con is that the online play is somewhat lacking compared to that of Xbox Live. The console was well planned and is one of the greatest consoles ever. 20 Years from now we will look at this console and compare it to the greatness of the NES.. 

$$;
Pros:. Affordable Fun, good mix of available games.. 
Cons:. Have to spend more time with the Kids.. 
Summary:. Considering the consumer backlash over the Wii, the PS format is affordable quality. Games for kids and Dad. We're sending back our Wii controllers, Feb 4 and still can't get a console, and UPGRADING to a PS2!. 

$$;
Pros:. Loads of games, nice looks, DVD right out of the box, nice controller, backward compatibility (PS1), USB and Firewire, last true 128 bit system, CD/DVD tray, and price.. 
Cons:. Reliability(the first generation systems), doesn't come with memory card, newer ones don't support the horizontal stand,.. 
Summary:. Alright, before I review PS2, I'm not a huge supporter of Sony in any way(I usually stick with Panasonic, RCA/GE, or Pioneer for electronics). I own and play NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn, Sega Dreamcast, Playstation, Playstation 2, Xbox, Nintendo 64, Gamecube, and tomorrow I'll be getting the Xbox 360. With that said, I'll get on with the review.. I was one of the lucky people to buy my first PS2 on October 26, 2000. I remember it very well because it was my first year of High school and I my first job that year. I ended up buying the system with Timesplitters and Midnight Club Street Racing with 2 months of paychecks. Since then, I've accumulated 25 games and gone through 4 systems.. I'll admit, first run of the systems had their flaws(I remember that I had to reset the system to switch from DVD to CD games). But they have definetly improved in quality. The first PS2 bought, I played the hell out of it. I also used it as my main DVD player(DVD players were expensive back then). After 2 and a half years, I could barely get it to work. So I gave it away and bought a brand new one. I also owned 2 systems of the redesigned consoles. They're smaller, but they tend to overheat. Also, the way the newer one has a flip top seems kind of cheap and would break over time. I would definetly go with the older system if you can find one in great shape, or brand new somewhere. I ended up buying a used old PS2 that was in great shape to replace the newly designed ones.. Anyways, the graphics started off decent(just like every other every system), but they have definetly gotten better over the years. Back then, it was hard to believe that you would see nice graphics on a game like Gran Turismo 4 Killzone when the system launched with only games like Midnight Club or Smugglers Run. I wouldn't say that the graphics are better than Xbox or Gamecube, but the graphics are great either way.. There has to be atleast 500 games to choose from now. There are RPG's, Action, First Person Shooters, Racing games, Classic Collections, fighting games, kiddie games, adventure, Crime Simulation, Flying games, Sports games, and RTS games. Like I said, there's many games to choose from. My personal favorite games include the Gran Turismo series, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2, Metal Gear Solid series, Midway Arcade Treasures Series, Dynasty Warrior series, Soul Calibur Series, Killzone, GTA series, Midnight Club series, Timesplitters Series, Capcom Classics, ATV Offroad Fury series, God of War, Simpsons Hit and Run, and many other great games to choose from.. Regarding the newer console generation, I honestly would like to see how PS3 does before I spend money on it. The way Sony is going with the PS3, it could really go either way. Xbox 360 won't live up to it's real potential for another 2-3 years atleast. The Nintendo Wii looks great, but it might not be for everybody. With that said, I can see PS2 lasting atleast another 3-4 years before Sony stops supporting for it. PS3 costs alot to make(BluRay, enough said) and they have to fix their losses somehow.PS2 can be a way to get them back on track.. In conclusion, PS2 is one of the best systems I've ever played. It's easily the best console of this generation. I would reccommend it to anyone who plays videogames and doesn't own one yet.. PS - I know I gave it a 10. To me the, PS2 is perfect. But if you look at any system, old or new, you will find flaws somewhere. Plus, I want to help even out the moronic and extemely biased reviews.. 

$$;
Pros:. THE BEST IN THE WORLD. 
Cons:. NONE NONE NONE. 
Summary:. PS2 RULES THE WORLD. 

$$;
Pros:. EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
Cons:. Can't play VCDs...... 
Summary:. Come on, this is the BEST GAMING CONSOLE EVER.....for now anyways. LARGE variety of games, awesome graphics, and a DVD player?!! awesome, just awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge library of games, exclusives, the best period. 
Cons:. Other than the online service it's perfect. 
Summary:. I hate when people say xbox is better then ps2 cause it ain't. First off people forget the ps2 put dvd's on the map, yes dvd's would have eventually been where it is today day but would have taken alot longer. Ps2 has a big user base, so a dvd player was in almost every household thanks to ps2's dvd playback function.. Another thing people forget when they compare graphics is that the ps2 was made to go against the dreamcast which was the only next generation system out at the time. Sony didn't know about the xbox specs, so how your gonna slam sony for something that they had no control over. The ps2 is backwards compatible which you can play all the classic ps1 games on it.. Also it's a fact that xbox 2 won't have backwards compatibility, so if you want to play halo or halo 2 you need your old xbox. Xbox has a hard drive but it took developers a while before they used it for something other then game saves. It's also a fact that by micorsoft putting the hard drive they lost millions of dollars on xbox.. Another thing is that ps2 has all the best exclusive games while xbox has a few multiplatform games and halo.. Where else can you play gta (first), gran turismo, god of war game and also soul calibur 3. The last game on that list is a good example, soul calibur 2 came out on ps2, xbox and gamecube, the reason why soul calibur 3 is a ps2 exclusive is because the other 2 systems didn't provide enough sales for it. Everyone on xbox is just playing halo 2 and gamecube is a kiddie system.. Xbox may have the better online service but you know what they charge for it and when the ps3 hits and has a new and improved online service for free everyone will hop to ps3. My point is the ps2 is a 10 not in graphics but in games and that's what counts. Xbox can have halo but tell me what there gonna do when there's no more halo, they'll fall. You can ask any game reviewer and any real gamer and they will tell you the only thing keeping xbox afloat is HALO.. So guys and gals don't get an xbox because it has better graphics but instead look at it's games and gameplay and you'll see there's nothing there. The ps2 is on top because of great games even though it doesn't have the power of a pc (xbox). The fact is that xbox with all it's power was never able to top an inferior system, not because sony had a year jump (remember dreamcast had a 2 year jump and fell to ps2) but because it's the best gaming platform.. 

$$;
Pros:. I am a gamer not a console loyalist... The PS2 has the best library of games bar none and online play is free!!!. 
Cons:. Graphics are begining to appear a bit dated.... 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of games.. 
Cons:. lack of player numbers.

Pros:. Now is cheap at $150 and still for sale by SONY, a massive selection of great games, memory sticks allow you to quickly get your memory stick, expansion bay allows for 40 GB HDD, built in DVD player.. 
Cons:. Only supports up to 480i, needs an external online adaptor, disc tray might scratch reading lens.. 
Summary:. The most popular video game console ever made with over 115,000,000 (115 million) sales worldwide. System has a great selection of games and uses memory sticks so you can easily take one out and go to your friends house to play. No wireless headsets are supported for online play, only corded, USB headsets are. Expansion bay will let you use a 40 GB HDD. System may also be used to run Linux software but is rare.. Overall this video game console is simple but highly upgradeable..

Pros:. wait to find the right deal on the internet. 
Cons:. none - just dont pay more than a hundred. 
Summary:. U can get a complete PS2 console, with 2 controllers, a memory card, a few games, a monster "s" video cable and even a carrying case for less than one hundred bucks. check out ebay:. http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#38;ih=012&#38;sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&#38;viewitem=&#38;item=220084258761&#38;rd=1&#38;rd=1.

Pros:. Huge Gaming Library. 
Cons:. No Network enterface. 
Summary:. The playstation 2 console is Ultmately the best Console out with the addition of the slimline version this version lacks the network adapter.Has huge game library..

Pros:. Great Selection of Games, only 2 contoller slots (if you like it). 
Cons:. only 2 controller slots (if you hate it). 
Summary:. I love this system, and as a bonus i connected it to a projecter for even more fun. But....when playing DDR it sometimes freezes which is annoying because i play for hours at a time with my freinds and lose all my progress. Any suggestions from all u PS2 users out there?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?. 

$$;
Pros:. Fully Backwards compatible, plays dvds, awesome third party support.. 
Cons:. only two controller slots, graphics aren't great compared to xbox's.. 
Summary:. Playstation 2 is definitely the winner of this generation's console war. It has sold the most, is the most popular, and has the best third-party support. Some people might view things differently and say that the xbox is, but the general audience has picked sony's playstation 2 to be the best. With a Playstation 2 you don't have to buy a kit to play dvds, get a huge choice of games to play, and most of your friends with consoles have one. Sure, the graphics are better with the xbox and it has more hard-drive. But graphics aren't everything and you really don't need all that hard-drive space. An 8mb graphics works fine. I have 12 games, and i haven't even filled half of a card yet. Plus, I have a friend who has an xbox, after one week of playing it, it started freezing and malfunctioned. My ps2 has never failed me before after five years of use, and no matter what others think, stat-wise, playstation 2 is the sure-fire winner of this generation's console war.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great selection of games, reliable. 
Cons:. not enough controller ports. 
Summary:. I've had this baby for 5 years now and I still love it. I've bought other systems but sold them after using them for a while. But the PS2 is something you keep. I love the large game selection and it always gives me something to do. The only thing I don't like is that there is only 2 controller ports. I feel there should be more for playings with multiple friends.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great graphics, sleek, goodlooking, plays dvds, large selection of games. 
Cons:. None in my book. 
Summary:. The only people that constantly try to bring down the PS2 are Halo/Halo 2 nerds.. The PS2 has great graphics. The people that go around saying differently can't tell the difference between the Xbox graphics and the PS2 graphics. They only repeat what they've heard.. I think the PS2 is wonderful. I've never had a problem with mine. I use mine more as a dvd player than a gaming console.. Each person will have their own opinion as to which is better (I don't even consider Gamecube to be competition). To each their own.. 

$$;
Pros:. hundreds of games to choose from, great graphics, games for anyone, great controllers, dvd playback, reliable system. 
Cons:. no hard drive, online gaming isn't the greatest. 
Summary:. I have had the Playstation 2 ever since the month after its release. I have never found anything wrong with it and I am always supplied with a fresh batch of games. I love the design of the controller which come in all varieties now. All of the games I have bought are still in great condition and so is the PS2 itself. Memory size is about my only problem. Memory cards only have 8 mb on them which limits the amount of saves. I have about 10 different memory cards for all of my games which gets confusing at times. Most games only allow 2 players because of the only 2 controller slots. This is alright most of the time, except when you are playing with a bunch of other people. Aside from the cons (of which have little effect on the gaming experience) this is a great system to own and it will provide entertainment for years to come.. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb graphics, very sexy, nearly unlimited amounts of games and accessories, best controller design in the business, Sony reliability, multimedia compatibility, dvd support, online gaming. 
Cons:. difficulty playing some games that were first released, graphics slightly less good than the xbox, no hard drive. 
Summary:. I bought my playstation 2 when it first came out in 2001. I was the first to have one of these and like the many other numerous idiots out there decided I needed it right then and shelled out five hundred dollars at Toys N Joys (local shop) however I have not regretted the purchase although I was a little salty when the price went down to $300 in a few weeks then down to 199 and then dropping to only 149. Being that I was in sixth grade when I bought it I didn't really care about the graphics and what not but the PS2 is really an amazing machine. The processor is reasonably fast and provides graphics that are crisp and clear. The one I bought has not given me any trouble at all over the past four years and even the original controller has not broken even though it has been thrown many times (I am an angry person). My PS2 has had a few problems playing a few of the earlier games like Midnight Club and Smuglers Run, but I suspect that this was just a first release glitch. I have also heard that the new slim ones overheat but really who cares. In this modern age 150 bucks is nothing, hell it wont even buy you a new cell phone, however this will provide you endless amounts of amusement and gaming for a sliver of the price you would pay for a high end gaming rig like an ALX. The only thing I would tell any one to wait for is the new PS3.. 

$$;
Pros:. tons of games, looks good, fairly small. 
Cons:. graphics could be a bit better. 

$$;
Pros:. dvd player, great new games, plays old games as well. Great controler. 
Cons:. you have to buy multi-tap to play 4-player games. 
Summary:. This is really good. I love it. I play it all the time. The new games are awsome. The only bad part is you have to buy multi-tap for the four player games, but there arnet many of those out there and it isnt very expensive anyway. You can play original play station 1 and play station games on it. It comes with a pretty comfortable controler. The DVD player is so cool. You only need a controler to play a movie and you don't have to buy anything for it, unlike XBOX. This is an awsome product by far.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great game selection, great controller configuration, serves as dvd player. 
Cons:. A bit bulky, graphically weaker than Xbox. 
Summary:. I have owned my ps2 since it was the "new thing" and I have never regreted it. The graphics, while not as good as the xbox, are still quite amazing, especially in final fantasy games. The gaming library for the ps2 is outstanding (I've sunk 140 hours into dark cloud 2) and I've watched many a DVD movie on it. Minorly annoying is needing the multitap for games with lots of players. Also if you like online play you will need the internet adapter but on the new slim ps2 this is included so it's not really a problem. So, if you don't already own a ps2, go out and get a slim ps2 and enjoy the cheaper price (around 150) and ethernet adapter and get to playing those great games. I know many friends that have Xbox's but I'm more than happy with my ps2 and I highly recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Largest library of games, huge 3rd party support, DVD features right out the box, familiar controller. 
Cons:. being the oldest means that X-Box and Gamecube have better graphics, heavily criticized for being released 1st. 
Summary:. $149.99 isn't exactly chump change, but this is one system that will go places. For those of you who say the X-Box has better graphics overall, which it does, remember that the PS2 was released 1 year earlier. Like the controller and how familiar it is. (if it ain't broken don't fix it, but do add some new stuff if needed) And, unlike the X-Box, it can play DVDs right out the box. Still, DVD remote highly recommended. As for the 2 controller port part, not really much of an issue for me as I'm pretty much a loner. Overall, get it. Graphics are still solid, as proven by games like MGS3.. 

$$;
Pros:. great games. has the most support from game developers.. 
Cons:. weakest graphics.. 
Summary:. the PS2 is most definitly not the most powerful video game system out, nor does it have the best graphics, it simply has the best games. devil may cry 3, grand theft auto:san adreas, metal gear solid 3, kingdom hearts 2, grand turismo 4, are just to name a few must have titles for the system. not to mention the must have "classics" that u can now by for $20 dollars or cheaper. xbox has the power and online ability. gamecube has mario, metriod, resident evil and zelda (which are must haves also). i love all 3 systems equally because all are great in their on way but, if i had to choose one, it would have to be the PS2 because it games are the games i play the most.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lets face it, its quality not quantity that we want. Keep your flashy graphics X-Box, real gammers want a history of outstanding titles and a quality of game play that is greater then the pictures them selves. The PS2 is easily your best choice for a larg. 
Cons:. Mulity Player... Half the fun of video games is enjoying them with other people... Lots of poeple. Having only two controller ports and a limited selection of high calibur multiplayer games; the PS2 falls short of other consols (such as the X-Box) in term. 

$$;
Pros:. the emotion engine on the ps2 houses the secret to its superior capabilities. Here's why the PS2 CPU (Emotion Engine) is a lot more powerful: -Data bus, cache memory as well as all registers are 128 bits on the PS2 CPU while the XBox CPU is 32 bits. -It. 
Cons:. the design of the console could have been flashier.. 

$$;
Pros:. Greatest games come out on the Ps2. 
Cons:. Most feature on other cosoles are worthless, but this is top nosh!. 

$$;
Pros:. Best games. Solid construction. Expandable. Plays PS1 titles. DVD and Audio CD aswell. Sits vertical or horizontal. Newer models have Progressive scan and built in remote IR. Online play is free.. 
Cons:. Basic unit doesn't come with a HD, Memory Cards, extra controllers, network adaptor. Look for special "bundles.". 

$$;
Pros:. Doesn't freeze up like most games on PCs. Tons of games, games are cheap compared to new systems.. 
Cons:. No built in memory and limited ability to save games, user interface for saving/editing games and info is not intuitive,. 
Summary:. Great system when I bought it and the kids and me still use to this day.. I'll get one of the new ones, PS3, XBox360 or Wii once the prices come down a little more, but until then, this still gets the job done.. 

$$;
Pros:. Library of Games. 
Cons:. No Hard Drive. 

$$;
Pros:. The controller was second to none. 
Cons:. It died on me but I played it to death. 
Summary:. I loved my PS2 while it worked but after years of use it gave out on me. It worked great for a while and I certainly got my money's worth. The PS2 controller is the best layout ever the contoller is what I miss the most.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great games with good audio, ok live abilities, DVD player built in. 
Cons:. the graphics on the games seem to be 50 50, not all games are great, alot of needed accsesories to get full experience. 
Summary:. PS2 is a a must have next gen console, featuring some classic titles and great single player experiences. However, there are alot of add ons that you need to purchase such as memory card for 15$, multitap to enable 4 player for 30 to 50$, Brodaband live thinggy that enables live for 30$, and depending on how many play at once almost 3 extra controlers for 30$ each. that adds up to around 300$ for the full system equiped to the max, it has many redimable features like the fantastic Audio and great game selection almost over 500 different games for it. The built in DVD player helps alot for the movie lovers and can save the troulbe of having to buy a DVD player. so you may save 200$ easy. overall the system is classic and a must have. 

$$;
Pros:. amazing lineup of games; has best means of control; sleek design; backed by great marketing; very popular; appeals to every audience; online play; multimedia features; backward compatible. 
Cons:. Hardware not very well built; visuals not on par with Xbox; hard to develop games for; supports only two players; online play not as good as Xbox's service;. 
Summary:. Sony once again offers a great console that has the full package. The Playstation 2 has a phenominal lineup of games that are bound to appeal to any gamer, core of mainstream. It offers many multimedia features along with online support, but these features just aren't as well done as Microsoft's Xbox, which seemingly trumps all the PS2's features. But despite some harware issues, there is no doubt the Playstation 2 will provide you with endless entertainment, which is what it's for..

Pros:. Great games,quality. 
Cons:. graphics is ok.

$$;
Pros:. Availability of various types of games keeps my girlfriend and I happy even though our gaming selection is very different. Sturdy (going on at least 3yrs) and doubles as a DVD player for me.. 
Cons:. Games seem bland after playing the Xbox. Online gaming behaves like an add-on function rather than integrated like the Xbox.. 
Summary:. I'm buying an Xbox to play games against my friends online since they all have one. Otherwise it wouldn't be worthwhile to switch to the Xbox, and even then I'm still keeping my PS2. Also like the look and UI of the Xbox games better.. 

$$;
Pros:. this is a good system but it is better then gamecub but i think xbox is the same. 
Cons:. dunno. 

$$;
Pros:. DVD playback with no add on needed. First rate games, lots of titles that can not be found on other systems. When you buy a game sysyem you buy it to play games, most other arguments for ownership are secondary. I am one of those people who own multiple g. 
Cons:. The PS2 while a good console, does have many faults that may make some look at other platforms. First off the graphics on the system while very good, lag behind the other systems. The lack of a built in hard drive and the absence of onboard network adapto. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice graphics and great sound.. 
Cons:. Had the PS2 for a little over three months and had a disk read problem. Sony fixed it, but I swear that the system was not new when I got it. The case looked like it was slightly used and contained LOTS of dust! Sony is normally conotated with superior. 

$$;

$$;
Pros:. It's all about the games -- and Sony's Playstation has the most and the best. The graphics are fantastic (despite what X-Box fanboys say) and it has the best audio capability out there. It plays DVDs right out of the box, has loads of peripherals, and can. 
Cons:. No HD. New model expected late 2005/6 to replace this console, but until then the games for the PS2 will be the best available. People cast their vote with their wallet and the PS2 has outsold the X-Box 10-to-1 worldwide.. 

$$;
Pros:. massive amount of games. 
Cons:. not the graphics power house from that generation.. 
Summary:. The ps2, though not the console with the best hardware capabilities, it bring me countless hours of fun gaming time with the large amounts of games. Metal Gear Solid series, Devil May Cry Series, Ace Combat Series, and those are just the few. When I got the ps2, it was priced at $199.99 CDN, so the price was fair in my opinion. All in all, it's a good console. In fact, recently ps2 has sold over 120 million units world wide, pretty good achievement in my view..

Cons:. The PS2 costs $149 out of the box, plus $99 for a HDD, plus $30 for a multitap, plus $15 for a memory card, plus $30 for a network adapter. After all these purchases, you would have a product that is close to an Xbox but still inferior (because of perfor.

Cons:. slow load, two ports for controllers, online play is poor xbox rules. 

$$;
Pros:. its smaller in design than the XBOX. 
Cons:. only two controller ports. you think sony would have learned that gamers want four controller ports, i mean even a nintendo 64 has four controller ports. No Hard Drive, Bad graphics, bad sound and low power.. 

$$;
Pros:. A large amount of games, and it looks somewhat better than the xbox.. 
Cons:. Video games require good VIDEO, and thats what you WONT get from Sony..

Pros:. A much wider library of games available than any other system. Gran Turismo 4 and Kingdom hearts series (final fantasy sucks now) ummm thats about it.. 
Cons:. Has become too commercialized, alot of ps2 fans say that it has the best games but no it has the most games. Breaks very easily again showing how commercialized the system has gotten since its big success with the ps1, they dont seem to care about the co. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the game titles. That is the one thing I miss about this system.. 
Cons:. It stops working for no apparent reason. My family has bought three, all of which broke at some point (these systems were not abused). I went with an XBox just looking for a reliable system, even with fewer titles.. 

$$;
Pros:. Design, games, large collection of games. 
Cons:. Low power, low quality, poor games except some, poor graphics, and many more.... 
Summary:. This is a bad system in terms of power, quality, and graphics.. 

$$;
Pros:. PS2 has the worst games. Basically no rated M games, so nothing worth your time. PS2 only has 2 controller ports, XBOX has 4. Plus you got to buy an online adapter to play online, XBOX comes with it installed. XBOX is much better and PS2 just plain out su. 
Cons:. It's Horrible!. 

$$;
Pros:. The only good thing is that it has some games that u cant get for any other system.

Cons:. unreliable, prone to breaking, prone to freezing, same unintuitive controller as ps1.... 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of good games to choose from. 
Cons:. Consoles are unreliable. 
Summary:. I bought a Sony Playstation and it broke after only one year's use. I bought a Sony PS2 and it broke after only 6 months. I have to send the console back to them to be repaired under the 1 year warranty and on top of it, I have to pay for the shipping charges. I'm sorry, but that is not a good product by anyone's standards. I should have stuck with the Microsoft XBox.. 

$$;
Pros:. what pro's?. 
Cons:. everything!. 
Summary:. im already on my fifth ps2, all the other broke whithin a month and I don't know why I even bothered and when I sold my last one my room felt much lighter and more calm like some sort of evil presence had left the building.. 

$$;

Summary:. It murdered the Dreamcast, so I hate it. 

$$;

Cons:. everything else. 
Summary:. this is just a traball system with a horibble lag, not much online suport as xbox, crappy know a lot of people who had to take theres back to get it repaird cause the dvd drive is a piece of junk. after a year with this garbage i gave it to my little brother an he still perfers the xbox over this anyday!. 

$$;

$$;
Pros:. I just can't think of any.. 
Cons:. My PS2 broke to many times (DRE's). Last time I played Socom U.S. Navy Seals, I had to kill two of my seal teams cause they were stuck on a tree on the 4th level.. 

$$;
Pros:. DVD player, CD player, large selection of games. (Although GameCube's games are a lot better. Even Xbox's are better than PS2's...). 
Cons:. TOO MANY CONS TO NAME! For one thing, no matter how large the game selection is, the games are still horribly mediocre. They have NO first-party support! They rely on every third-party company to do things for them. GET OFF YOUR LAZY ASS AND DO SOMETHING. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice game but they play crapy.. 
Cons:. last time i played ps2 was before i got an X box. Broke one 2 many times also..
