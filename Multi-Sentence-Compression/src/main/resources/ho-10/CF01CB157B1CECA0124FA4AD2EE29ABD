downside for me , is that walkway means guet will be walking right by my window , 6 '' away from me , so even on nice day i have to keep curtains drawn which makes room have no natural light .
instead of a sofa , a fancy reclining type chair , ok if single but for couples in room surely a sofa is better , as then it is lying on bed only choice .
the much higher ( too high price rate ) rate is charged and limited to one device , i have 2x company devices and my personal laptop .
this is enough to stop me staying here on business as i need use 2x laptops to work and i am not allowed to use company laptops for my own internet browsing ! !
very good room rates fri-mon , during weekdays rates higher due to business stayers but totally negated by poor basic wifu and exorbitant speedy wifi rates , charged per laptop .
free minibus xfer only mon-fri , weekends is 1/2 hourly bus ( 4 euro ) or taxi ( 10euro ) to station , bus stop is 100m from hotel reception .
i do n't need movie download , gaming internet speeds , but i found free 512 speed terible and all but useless , and normally hotels allow 2 or 3 devices per signup , i ca n't pay for 3x laptops per night . . . . . . . . . .
wifi dissapointing , free is so called 512 rate , but was too slow to load my emails or look at online newspapers .
interesting hotel layout , rooms in a ring round open atrium center of hotel , with inner and outer balcony walkways used to access rooms .
minibar is a fridge , has mini spirits , water , beer etc , but loads od free space for own water/cola/milk etc .
