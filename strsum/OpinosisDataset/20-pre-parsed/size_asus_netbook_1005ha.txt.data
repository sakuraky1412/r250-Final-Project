0 out of 5 stars perfect size netbook, september 23, 2009

his full sized laptop dies after about 2 hours of use .

smaller size videos   play even smoother .

screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .

the keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .

if i were looking to get work done quickly, i would pay the extra money to go full, sized, even if it's slower .

the screen size works just fine for me .

it's 90% size keyboard doesn't take too long to get used to .

surprisingly readable screen for the size .

the keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .

someone else suggested going to the store first to check out the size .

like how they made keyboard as large as possible unlike qosmio 17  which is almost same size .

the power adapter is a nice small size

some reviewers have complained about the physical size of the battery extrusion from the bottom of the netbook .

ended up with this one based on smaller size, lighter weight and the overwhelming number of positive reviews .

,  don't know why they use the screen size most do ,  1024 x 600 seems cramped

light weight and small size ,  this was highly important during my travels .

the overall size seems right on target, small enough to easily travel, but large enough to be usable .

it runs quietly and operates windows efficiently, staying incredibly cool compared to the instant burn, your, lap sauna of my full, sized hp pavillion .

this netbook is just the right size, great for travel and the 10 .
