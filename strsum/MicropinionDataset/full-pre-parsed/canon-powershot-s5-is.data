i knew a few people with this camera before i got mine , and they were very happy  .

after owning this camera for a while , a bit over a year , i too am very happy with it  .

four of my friends have gotten one just because of the pictures they have seen taken with my s5 is  .

now my parents are looking at getting one too .

i think this is the best combinations of options you can get in a hi zoom camera  .

what i like most is the quality of the video and still being able to use 12x optical zoom while shooting video also the night snapshot brings out brilliant photos even in the darkest places  .

i just love it  .

this has been an excellent buy , as it caters to all my needs    taking good photos at a fairly good speed and the fact that it clicks photos even during video recording is an unbelievable bonus  .

look no further , ths is a great buy .

canon s5 is the best prosumer high end , slr like camera available  .

this little s5 , 120mm long 450g camera is flooded with fantastic features  .

let me list a few   remote control of the shutter from pc ; amazing face detection ; 12x zoom with efficient image stabilizer is up to the very tele end of the zoom and also effective in video recording ; stereo sound ; professional aperture and shutter time priority modes as well as a full automatic mode for starters ; also a full manual control of everything including focus for professionals and creative amateur photographers ; 2    level macro , regular effective 100 to 500mm and super macro effective 0 , thats right , zero to 100mm from the lens ; flash with 3 levels of light intensity up to 5  .

2m effective ; easy to use menus with each and every control at the finger tip , and much , much more  .

when investigating the reviews for this camera and a competitive model with a seducing 18x zoom , i noticed two major complaints about it , the lens cap pops off very easily , and the noise is not acceptable in iso settings over 400  .

it should be noted this camera is not a professional slr and its assumed the user of this s5 will never need prints larger than 4x6 and very rarely up to a letter size 11x17 , and in such sizes noise cannot be noticed even with iso1600  .

it can only be clearly seen in what professionals call 100% crop in their reviews  .

besides , everything should be paid for ; reducing noise equals losing details on the other side  .

so , clean details and noise should be balanced at some reasonable point  .

and about the lens cap , i really cant imagine what pressure would have been on the motor if the lens cap did not pop off easily when you definitely forget to take off the cap before turning the camera on 50% of the times i believe  .

one more thing , the 18x zoom announced on a few other cameras works mostly on the wide side , say from 28mm equivalent focal length , also , the is does not work well on the tele side and you will have issues with your hand shake  .

bottom line & i highly recommend this magic canon s5  .

i would suggest adding a set of nimh batteries and charger along with a lens hood and adaptor and also a uv filter to leave in place to protect the lens all the time .

it is a very good camera for any user .

i dont know why people are giving this camera such bad ratings it seems like your expecting pro quality from a 500 dollar camera  .

its battery life is not bad at all i have had this camera for two years now im pretty sure and have had no problems and i use it alot  .

i love this camera  .

im not saying it is the best but it is worth the price updated  .

on sep 4 , 2010  .

this is a good camera and but it cant use rechargeable batteries so i have to keep using replaceable ones gets expensive  .

i love the flip around screen leesens the chance of finger prints on the screen .

i would definately recommend this cam especially now since prices have dropped significantly  .

butterflyphoto has the best price on it and they always deliver on time .

i have owned many digital cameras  .

eight to be exact  .

i take pictures everyday , photography is a hobby of mine plus i'm getting ready to have my own home studio soon  .

i like the close to dslr cameras because they offer a lot more features than a regular dslr camera and it had given me lots of practice before i jump into the dslr field the canon s5is is worth every penny i paid for it  .

it has the fastest record time in focusing and taking a picture out of any camera i've used  .

the face detect works flawlessly  .

i took the canon with me to disney world and to daytona and took 2 , 000 photos , all of the photos came out there is not one blurred or one that is just okay or average  .

i took night shots of the fireworks at magic kingdom and wow  .

i have now professional looking fireworks that is captured on my vacation that i will have forever thanks to this awesome camera  .

most of my pictures taken at disney world could be turned into post cards they look that great  .

you just cannot go wrong with this camera  .

it offers everything you can think of and has so many advanced features out of the cons i did find it annoying with the flash you have to manually raise it , lots of times i'd be ready to take my picture and it beep and on the screen would say , raise flash  .

it is easy to forget to do that so i'd miss a shot  .

then the battery compartment has the memory card next to it , so when replacing the card the batteries lots of times would fall out  .

those were the annoying features about the camera to me  .

not to much to complain about though , but i did also find that some of the menus and features were hard to understand and hard to get to  .

this camera is definatly one that takes a little time learning , you can shoot pictures as soon as you get it out of the box even if your a novice or beginner , but it does have a learning curve for the more complicated features the pros outweigh the cons majorly though  .

i've never seen a camera that focuses and takes a photograph so quickly  .

the speed is so fast you definatley won't miss a shot with this camera  .

it has so many features the most i've ever seen on any camera i've owned  .

the sad part is i sold this canon s5is for a sony dsc    h50 thinking i is upgrading i is wrong  .

the sony offers 9 megapixels (canon 8) sony has full 1080 hd    but you have to purchase seperate cord , sony has a 3 inch tilt screen but the screen does not flip around to keep it from getting scratched the canon will even though the screen is 3 inches on the sony , the canon's 2  .

5 inch is better  .

the sony does not even compare to the speed of the canon  .

sony offers a smile shutter , a remote to take photos    which i do admit is handy that's what made my choices in selling the canon s5is  .

i had owned 2 sony cameras previously and seeing the upgrades the sony offered i thought i had to have the sony over the canon s5 i realized quickly what a mistake i had made  .

the sony feels like cheap plastic , yes its lightweight but it does not feel like it is constructed to hold up , the canon feels well built , the layout of the canon is easier to grip and hold  .

the canon's buttons are laid out easier and quicker to access  .

the sony is slow compared to this canon , and half the time the sony does'nt focus correctly  .

i never had a problem with the canon focusing  .

the reasons i sold the canon were to get a camera that had automatic pop up flash , the remote , bigger screen , higher megapixels , smile shutter and full 1080 hd but even though you cannot get that on the canon the canon is a much better camera  .

i'd trade back my canon s5is any time  .

i'm in pure regret that i do not still have the canon s5is  .

if your looking at other cameras and cannot decide go to the store and take a good look at them , try them out  .

look at the sony dsc    h50 to see the differences  .

the canon after taking around 25 , 000 pictures in 4 months with it and then selling it for the sony i see how much of a mistake it is and the canon is just all around the best model between the two  .

i like my sony dsc    h50 but i know it does'nt match up to the canon  .

when i upgrade to a dslr i'm going with a canon  .

i have owned 3 sony cybershots a sony dsc    v3 , dsc    h5    which the auto focus went out on and now the sony dsc    h50 i've only owned one canon and it proves to be the better brand name so if you can live with no auto flash and the batteries falling out when changing memory cards then go buy this canon  .

that is the only cons to the camera which now owning the newer sony i see that the canon's flaws were minor and i should have kept the canon  .

i hope if your looking for a camera that my review is somewhat helpful in deciding  .

if your looking for a great camera with alot of features and not wanting to go full dslr go with the canon s5is  .

i received this camera as a gift and i absolutely love it  .

i love how fast the shutter is  .

i have horses and the fast shutter makes it easier to capture pictures of them without creating any blurring i receive from my other camera  .

the built in image stablization also helps a lot       i like to take my horse riding on the beach with friends and i can capture great pictures whether i'm running or slowly moving  .

i have been very pleased with the pictures i have taken using this particular camera .

this is my first digital camera  .

i have always used 35mm slrs up to this point  .

before taking the plunge into the digital format , i read a lot of reviews on many makes and models of full    body cameras from several manufacturers  .

mainly i is wanting a camera in the 9 to 12 megapixel range but economically i settled for this camera and i am extremely happy with it the first thing i noticed is the full array of options available to the user  .

in full auto mode i snapped shots that had full sun mixed with fairly deep shade and the pictures were rendered without any need for editing to bring out the detail in either the highlighted or shadow areas  .

in manual mode i took a photo at dusk and again is pleasantly surprised by the results since i could barely make out what i is shooting in the ambient light but , again , it is rendered very well this camera might be too daunting for a casual photographer who only wants a point    and    shoot camera for snapshots , but an enthusiast will be pleased with thus cameras capabilities along with being flexible enough to allow one to easily explore its advanced features and advance in their photographic technique too for the money , this is a great camera  .

chromatic aberration , pincushion and barrel distortion are to be found any camera i know of , but then i have not seen anyone review the hasselblad h3cii either and at almost $40 , 000 i would expect it to be almost perfect  .

all in all , for all of its feaures and its performance the s5 is is quite a bit better than many regardless of price .

i just returned from a vacation in utah arizona that gave the s5 is a real workout  .

the images are better than my new sony alpha 350 dslr i do not understand the comments of the editor's review  .

the clarity of the lens and the results it deliveries is fantastic  .

yes , it is a little larger than the simple point and shoot cameras with no viewfinder  .

i will trade quality for size any day  .

if you want great pictures buy this great camera easy to use in auto mode  .

plenty of control in tv , a , m modes for the advanced photogs , sharp handheld images at 12x optical zoom , very low noise , accurate color , what more can you ask  .

image results are a 10 .

i have used point and shoot cameras for the past several years , and i is looking for an extended zoom camera this time i would love to have a dslr , but being a student i do not have the money to dish out for that type of camera the canon s5 fit the bill perfectly for my needs  .

it can be taken out of the box , set to automatic and take amazing shots  .

or if you are like me and learning about photography , you can customize all settings (shutter/iso etc )  .

i would recommend this camera for beginners  .

i love it  .

i recently upgraded from a sony dsc    t1 and what difference  .

say goodbye to red eye and grainy pictures this camera is spectacular ; especially those in low light and indoors  .

if you have children i highly recommend this camera  .

never miss a precious moment again ; school plays , dance recitals sporting events ; all great pictures  .

however , the only sacrifice is portability , this camera is full size  .

but if you want that digital slr but do not want spend that kind of money , this camera is the perfect fit  .

i recently spent $349  .

00 at one of the major department stores and since the new canon's are hitting the shelves you'll probably find it cheaper now  .

good luck  .

great camera  .

i used to have a sony point and shoot , gave canon a try and i love it  .

once i got used to the menu styles it became very easy  .

would def  .

recommend this to others .

i have a canon a710is and a high end pro non slr sony camera but is was cheaper to get the s5is than to buy a slr and a long lens for it  .

it does a great good for it is designed for    image stabilized    a long lens    a lot of shotting options    and a great video with good sound    it's not $2000  .

00 slr    you can auto or set the camera to do what you want    and also it shots very fast continuous mode and continuous with af between shots  .

i have been using the powershot s5 for 3 months now and can say it is the best digital camera i have ever owned  .

i prefer canon due to the range of features it offers , and the s5 meets all of my expectations  .

it works great for indoor/outdoor shots , action shots , and even night shots of the recent lunar eclipse (using manual mode for exposure time and manual focus) the s5 is not a compact camera , as it has a large 12x optical zoom , but it's still small enough to be very portable if you buy an appropriately sized camera case  .

the s5 has a fast focus , good flash , fast zoom , and great battery life       i put 4 four fully charged nimh aa batteries in the camera when i first received it and those batteries lasted for 2  .

5 months (~600 shots) before i had to swap to my spare set of nimh batteries as others have said , the lens cap comes off easily , but that's not a problem if you attach it to the camera using the supplied strap  .

the battery compartment , which holds both the sd card and the batteries , is hard to open , but not exceptionally hard ; as long as you're careful about opening and closing the compartment it should be fine  .

in summary , excellent superzoom camera .

this is a great camera for someone who does not want to go full slr  .

the way i rationalized it is that if i were going to but a camera and leave it on the automatic settings then this is the camera for me  .

i can graduate into an slr but i think that will be a long way down the road .

best digital camera i have ever owned  .

shutter speed in action mode is great  .

i took some great pictures at a nfl game    picture quality is great with no blur the lens cap is like spandex in the 90's  .

did you really look in the mirror before you left the house  .

i know someone at canon had to realize the lens cap popped off too easily .

i have compared canon powershot s5 is with olympus sp550uz , sony dsc h9 , panasonic lumix fz18 and also with canon powershot s3 is  .

here is the review    .

if you take a photo with 2058 1536 resolution using s3 is as wll as using s5  .

both the photo will be identical  .

apart from this s5 has auto face detection which is a major advantage over s3 as canon has stopped manufacturing s3 , it is not available in most of the store  .

and the only way to purchase it through online  .

where as s5 is available in most of the store as it is a latest one  .

the price difference between s3 is and s5 is is only $32  .

however it is not recommended for those users , who wants to upgrade their camera from s3 is to s5 is as there are no major difference between these two camera  .

and both the camera produces almost same quality photos this is a camera which can be recommended for those user who does not have a megazoom point shoot camera and who wants to make choice among sony dsc h9 , panasonic lumix fz18 , olympus sp550 uz and canon powershot s5 is  .

because this camera produces excellent photos among all these models  .

and it has great set of features so the choice is canon  .

that's it .

for a compact digital camera this little chap is brill , great for those who just want to take family snap shots ect , and for those who want something more creative ,  .

there are automatic settings plus a load of manual settings to keep you interested ,  .

the video is very good too great for keepping memorys of your little ones as well as great photo's  .

if you want more buy an slr (but no video)  .

i found this very helpful to have read (besides the cnet review) before my purchase of this camera    .

http  //www  .

dcresource  .

com/reviews/canon/powershot_s5    review/  .

my pictures have had so many compliments  .

this camera has literally improved my photography skills just by learning more about its remarkable features  .

more features than any other digital camera i have seen for under $275  .

00 this is an absolutely perfect camera for someone who would like to experience professional like photography for less than $275  .

get fast sd high capacity flash cards  .

you will be glad you did  .

aa batteries and sd card usage makes this camera more affordable than other cameras to use on a constant basis  .

2 sets of 2500 mah batteries + car charger will cost you less than 35  .

00 and are well worth the investment taking great pictures is made so easy with this camera  .

you get much more than you pay for when you buy this camera  .

if you do not have a decent digital camera now , you should buy this asap and be prepared for an experience in photography which will you will tell your friends and family about for years to come i rarely go anywhere without this camera as keeping it close has proven to be an easy way to catch awesome photos on a constant basis .

i took quite a while evaluating this camera vis    ï¿½    vis the sony dsc    h9 and went so far as to take memory sticks to the store to get sample images printed  .

i also ended up buying the h9 , but after working with it for a few days , decided it is not laid out very well (awkward to maneuver controls , etc  .

the sony had the benefit of the higher zoom and larger screen , but when it came all the way down to it , i returned the sony (thanks , best buy , for a relatively smooth process except for the 15% restock fee  .

) and bought the canon  .

truthfully , the 15%was a sizeable hit , but if i is going to have a camera , it is worth the price of research to get the right one now , on to my experiences with the canon  .

i already had a slim point    and    shoot with the sony dsc    t70 , which is great for up    close stuff , but especially as it aged , the zoom and flash compensation for zoom has degraded a bit  .

i bought the canon for an upcoming trip to visit family in belgium and paris  .

anyone who has been in europe knows that some of the most beautiful photographs are at the top of the buildings (architecture , detail , etc  .

) , so getting a camera better suited to zoom is a necessity  .

however , although i have been taking pictures for over 30 years (and i'm not too bad at it  .

) , i'm not a professional photographer and want to get the best quality from the subject i am photographing without needing to stage and/or set    up special lighting , etc  .

the canon seemed to meet the need once we were on our way , i is not disappointed  .

the image quality , both on the camera's screen and the resulting printed photographs , would challenge a higher    end camera costing 10 times this one  .

during the course of 10 days , i took over 700 pictures , and not one of them is a disappointment  .

of course , having enhancement software to bring out the things lurking in the shadows helped a lot , too , but if the camera had not been able to capture the detail , no amount of light and balance adjustment would have made a difference since getting home , the camera has continued to capture amazing images of family (kids , grandma , etc  .

) and experiences (my son's friends' amazing tp    ing job on the house  .

) some day , i may break down and get the rebel eos , but maybe not because the i5is is meeting all my needs .

love this camera  .

i had a canon s40 and after doing lots of research , i decided to move up to this  .

the speed difference is amazing   start up speed and shutter speed is very fast  .

the picture quality is astounding  .

the various shooting options such as 'fireworks , ' 'aquarium , ' 'beach , ' and others are nice to have and easy to get too  .

the movie function is so easy to use  .

the camera feels sturdy and is easy enough to use that my 10 year old son had it figured out in no time  .

the automatic iso feature takes a lot of worry out of taking certain kinds of shots  .

only down sides are the annoying lens cap which can pop off at the slightest touch and the flash card that comes with the camera  .

it is only allows you to take about 10 pictures so right off the bat you have to buy a larger sd card  .

some of the picture quality issues mentioned by cnet aren't as much a concern for me because i am only an amateur photographer and likely would not notice those flaws  .

love this camera and cant wait to try it under some different conditions .

i'm appalled at the bashing this camera is taking across the net by expert reviewers and consumers alike  .

if i were a paranoid , i'd suspect that a conspiracy exists to drive down the price of this splendid piece of photographic wizardry yes , there are minor issues inherent with sensor size and zoom lens range  .

if you're planning to make poster sized prints , by all means get a different camera  .

but if you are planning most of the time to make average sized prints (8 x 10 , for instance) and do the majority of your image viewing on your computer , this one is perfect at the moment , there is not a camera of this class that offers better range of controls , imaging or performance  .

i've shot with the camera in all of its modes , and i'm very , very pleased with the quality of the images  .

performance is top    notch across the board  .

controls are broad and very intuitive  .

you can pluck your new camera out of the box and begin snapping very good pictures and movies without a glance at the instruction manual       although you'll want to to make fullest advantage of the amazing things this tool has to offer i'm an advanced amateur photographer , and i'm a perfectionist  .

if i can be more than satisfied with the s5 is       and i am  .

it's beyond my comprehension that anyone else could be disappointed with their purchase  .

for me it impressively bridges the gap between my eos 30d and the tiny compact point    and    shoot in my bag if you want flawless , noise    free images , you should not even be considering a camera in this class  .

you will be satisfied with nothing less than a digital slr  .

but if you're looking for point    and    shoot ease with plentiful controls and ample zoom range with image stabilization , look no further  .

the powershot s5 is is the camera .

i got one of these camera's for myself and my mother  .

i had an old digital camera , and it is time to update  .

we went up to the mountains and pulled over on the side of the road  .

there is no way to get out , and take a picture of some rams and elk on the side of the road  .

no worries  .

opened my sun roof , and tilted the screen , holding the camera high up i could see what i is pointing at , and took some framable pictures of the wild life  .

i cannot be more thrilled with the picture quality , ease of use  .

mom is scared to touch it at first  .

now she is taking tons of photos  .

my brother cannot afford to get his kids photos professionally done  .

however , grandma's photo's look like they were done in a studio  .

i love this camera  .

i have used the s3 as well the best change frankly is being able to move that screen  .

so this camera is definately a perfect fit for us  .

i use a 58mm 500d lens a lot to take pictures of insects  .

i use these pics to give classes in primary schools to jr master gardeners about the good bugs and bad bugs in the garden  .

i also give classes in how to make raised garden beds for growing food in your back yard and how to make a cold frame or hot house to grow plants from seed this camera is an important tool in making my class photos which i present to others  .

the first page is a photo of a butterfly (american lady) and a note that all photos were taken with a canon camera .

it's a great camera for someone who doesnt want to learn an slr but wants more features and control  .

overall it does take good pictures as long as you dont zoom all they way out and then blow up the picture bigger than 8x10 .

just got this camera for my bday and used it on my trip to vegas and it gave me beautiful memories  .

i am a photography student and love this camera  .

the pictures come out beautiful day or night  .

if you want something close to an slr and not ready yet get this camera  .

it's easy to use has a good lcd screen .

have been using this camera for 2 months  .

good for the amateur photographer  .

a nice way to learn different features at a cost effective price takes great pictures  .

i do not like the 4aa batteries (annoying to change/charge etc) and the sd card is hard to pop out in a hurry good picture quality , great feature set , nice lens bad stuff   like all cameras of this type , bad above iso400  .

no raw output  .

some distortion noted  .

not as bad as the cnet review but i can see what they mean  .

i barely recommend it over the sony  .

you will take better pictures than a point and shoot but you will not match the dslr which is exactly why you would buy this camera and what it is advertised to be .

i is a hobby photographer with an olympus om 1 a while back but up to recently , i relied on a sony point and shoot which did an adequate job , but the camera is limited  .

i did not want to go whole hog back into a high end camera , but i did want to get better distance shots , more mpxs , and some lighting flexibility  .

the s5 is seems to be doing the trick so far  .

it is a bit heavy , but that is the price for the telephoto  .

lots of different options for shooting  .

the first set of batteries went pretty quick , but they were the stock ones that came with the camera  .

second set are still in it  .

pictures are great compared to the old sony and i even got some shots of the total lunar eclipse  .

contrary to the cnet review , my lens cap stays on (except when i forget to take it off and it pops off when the lens comes out  .

the powershot s5 is an excellent camera all around but when i use the external canon 220ex flash i had to do a series of tests to arrive at a correct exposure considering the camera and flash have ettl this type of testing should not have to be done i am very happy that the s5 can do video at 640 x 480 at 30 frames and record in stereo sound i'm disappointed that i can not use a wireless remote control for video regards robert  .

dont listen to the naysayers check the other pro reviews and you will get the real picture  .

do your research before buying  .

cons like abberations and image quality are bogus  .

it is physically impossible to avoid those very small issues with a super zoom camera since the physical size of the sensor has to be so small  .

there will always be a sacrifice with this camera  .

the only way to get better is go slr which is much bigger and heavier and costs 3    5 times as much  .

any pro that quotes aberrations as a con in a super zoom camera like this does not know his own business check the real pros online and see what they say  .

you will see that i am right .

i use this as a backup to my slr system and as a small camera to carry when i do not want to carry all my other gear  .

sure , it has some of the limitations of other point shoots but overall i am very happy with it  .

biggest problem is with battery cover  .

it's so hard to close i'm afraid it's not going to last to long  .

does anyone have any tips on how to get it to close any easier  .

doesn't trying to choose a camera stink  .

you think you've settled on one and then you read a review and you nitpick this or that seems every camera has a serious pro with a serious con  .

annoying  .

none of us want to be pennywise pound foolish , but do you really need to spend a grand for a good shot  .

the camera  .

the camera itself is easy to hold , not too heavy , and the buttons are all in the right places it seems  .

i have had it a week and have yet to accidentally hit a wrong button  .

many desired features have their own button  .

i haven't figured out how to use them all , but i particularly appreciate the button on the back that instantly starts the video recording  .

this camera takes very good video with the stereo microphones in the front (above the lens under the flash)  .

you can instantly adjust iso levels (if not on auto) , multi    shots , timer , zoom , flash , display , etc  .

the dial on top lets you choose your different modes of pictures  .

i particularly appreciate it remembering where you left off  .

for example , scn lets you choose from a number of different types of shots (indoor , beach , aquarium , snow , fireworks , foliage , etc  .

when you turn the camera off and go back to scn , it remembers where you were  .

so , if you take a lot of indoor shots you can quickly switch over to indoor mode by just turning the dial the pictures  .

the pictures are a mixed bag and i'm still experimenting  .

the camera has a macro setting for close up pictures  .

i love to get in close on faces and have some beautiful pictures as a result with and without flash  .

unfortunately other pictures have come out grainy and i haven't figured out why that's happening  .

part could be me not getting off macro mode and the camera keeps trying to focus close up , but i really don't know  .

i had also changed the settings to lower pixels but superfine quality  .

now i've moved to the second    to    top tier of pixels with superfine quality to see if that helps  .

i bought a 4gb card for this camera , highly recommend (of course they may have greater ones soon as always)  .

this camera also has a super macro mode that let's you get right next to the object in focus  .

that too is an awesome feature for taking closeups of people or plants , etc this camera is also quick , taking pictures very quickly  .

you can get set up , focused and rattle off a shot in no time  .

i went to my son's soccer game and the camera has a sports setting which i believe adjusts for capturing movement but also stops the review feature after taking a picture , so you can rattle off a number of shots without interference from reviewing every shot (although you could set it to stop you just turn the dial to sports mode and it's gone) the cap  .

yeah , the cap does fall off pretty easily  .

but i must say , on many occasions now i have picked up the camera and just turned it on  .

the cap just slides off without damaging the lens  .

i think i'm very glad that happens  .

so , not sure what to say , it stinks it tends to get knocked off easily but then again you won't damage your camera from turning it on with the cap on battery life  .

ok , this deserves a wow  .

batteries really seem to last a long time with this camera  .

i put the regular batteries in that came with the camera and sure enough it lasted for days and hundreds of shots  .

i bought the 2500 rechargables and expect them to last a very long time with this camera other stuff  .

the camera has the hotshoe (place on top of the camera to stick a flash)  .

apparently that's a good thing but i haven't taken advantage of it yet  .

the memory card is in with the batteries , yes  .

and i suppose it's a bit tight to close but that's about it  .

it doesn't take all that much  .

the 4gb card i bought came with a usb adapter so i haven't used the enclosed software  .

is surprised there is no a/c adapter with the camera and to buy separately is $45 or so at this point  .

not going to happen  .

with the excellent batterly life and separate usb adapter for the card (don't have to have camera on to download pictures) , i'm not going to worry about it just yet conclusion  .

i really like the camera  .

for now under $400 it's a lot of camera at a reasonable price  .

i do not have any regrets  .

i have had this camera about a week and have taken a few pictures , using all the available features  .

very satisfied to date the lens cap issue is not a concern , nor is the battery container , as others have mentioned  .

the instruction books leave a lot to be desired , and i have called technical support several times for assistance  .

i get through promptly and the techs are knowledgable and helpful  .

i would buy the canon batteries and charger because the batteries included do not last very long and give almost no warning when they expire .

in the cnet video , they complain that the lens cap comes off to easily  .

it is designed this way on purpose , in case you power the camera on without taking the cap off first the lens is retracted into the camera when it is off , so when you turn it on , the lens extends  .

i'm guessing canon didn't want the drive motors for the lens to get shot , just b/c the lens cap is on i took this camera mountain biking , and the lens cap never fell off  .

the rest of the camera is great like any other camera , you must get used to the controls before you really know what it can and cannot do  .

if you are used to canon products , then the learning curve is not too bad the image quality of photos taken is fantastic  .

even when shooting in low light (with the proper settings) , i is able to capture scenes without excessive noise  .

taking photos with the zoom is incredible    this camera zooms so quickly , and when bracing against a tree or any other object , allowed me to take photos in digital zoom without any noise shooting movies is pretty cool , too  .

the sound quality is amazing for a digital camera , it has stereo mics  .

the image quality is great , too  .

i is very impressed by th responsiveness of this camera previously , i had a fujifilm finepix s700 , and ended up returning it  .

in contrast , the s5 is an incredible value for only $100 more  .

i also considered a sony h7 , but didn't like the fact i would have to purchase a memory stick and it did not use aa batteries .

i read many reviews of this camera from personal users to professional websites  .

i i am a mom and a grandma who likes to take a lot of pictures  .

(no professional here  .

) i is looking for a camera that is quick , had a good zoom , that took movies and is easy to use  .

i picked the perfect one  .

i have taken pictures inside and outside and printed them myself on the canon pixma printer ip6310d and they came out beautiful  .

i received so many compliments  .

i is not ready for an slr but this camera gives me the option to add a wide angle lens if i would like to  .

i have not had any problems closing the battery door like mentioned in some of the reviews  .

the price is right and i am totally satisfied  .

if you are looking for a reasonably priced camera that takes excellent pictures give it a try  .

first of all , i never had an s3 , so for all those folks complaining that there is no improvement , sorry  .

this is the first go round for me and so far i am completely enthralled  .

i waited because i did not want a 6 mpxl camera and i got real excited when canon came out with a super zoom 8 mgpxl pnt shoot  .

the is really is not that great tho , cause i is thinking i could ride over a bumpy road , shoot , and all would come out ok  .

gee  .

what a surprise  .

also , the 'shooting' in the middle of movie making is still a mystery as i cannot find where these 'stills' are stored  .

but the camera is really nice , the pictures are superb and we're both doin just fine  .

i'm really liking it  .

but i've only had it 2 wks  .

i'll write again later , after we've spent more time together .

i really like this camera  .

my nikon coolpix 5700 recently broke and i looked around for a replacement  .

i ended up choosing this camera and am very pleased  .

when all zoomed in i can take very sharp crisp pics while holding the camera (no tripod , no support) thanks to the image stabilization  .

the face detection is great for taking pics with people off center  .

the manual/creative modes are much easier to find than on my nikon  .

i've already used those modes more since they are so easy to use/select  .

i do not see the lense artifacts some wrote about  .

i'm just a serious amateur who usually print 5x7 and 4x6 and the occasional 8x10  .

i'm very happy with the photo quality .

i have purchased canon s5is 4 months back  .

i am enjoying with it and it's very nice gadget for a beginer who is like me  .

easy to handle , one touch recording , lcd and all other features are amazing  .

but it eats lot of my battery power  .

i have encore    rechargable 2700mah batteries  .

but it will be over within few mins  .

after that i have purchased sony nh    aa    b4e 2500mah batteries  .

no use  .

it does the same thing  .

i am worried about this problem  .

now i am planing to buy a 7  .

4 dc adaptor .

the good thing about this camera is its 12x zoom at a relatively compact size  .

i also enjoy its super    macro capability and the camera's overall versatility  .

i can take clear pictures in broad daylight which are visibly better than those from my compact sony 7  .

1 mp camera  .

however , at lower light conditions (e  .

late afternoon , indoors etc  .

) which requires higher than 100 isos , the pictures are quite noisy  .

in fact i would recommend using iso    100 and brighten up the picture with some software tool  .

the built in flash can also help but at close range and indoors  .

me overall experience is mixed   i like it but i am not enthousiastic about it  .

the noise problem under low light is really the biggest issue (lens cap coming off , lack of raw format etc  .

are just minor details in my opinion)  .

another thing that i do not like is the low resolution electronic viewfinder  .

why not have just an optical one  .

editor , you mean 'nice lcd' , not 'nice lcd _display_'  .

the longer i use it the happier i get  .

unlike the s3 this is a real update of the s series camera  .

so many little changes were made that you are relearning things but overall made it a better camera first thoughts after buying ;  .

1) the new lens cap is even worse  .

it seems like it pops off a lot easier then the s3 2) while the batteries are now easy to get in and out it is now harder to close the battery door 3) it is now heavy on the battery side  .

there must be more plastic this time , making it noticeably heavy when you hold it for the first time 4) the increased body size is enough that you will have to hold the s5 with your right hand differently form the s2 or s3 5) the button layout is easier to reach but are soft to push  .

there is not sensitive so you have to push hard to get a result 6) the menus have changed some , the iso now comes up as a pop up menu you can go back and forth with so you do not have to cycle through the whole list to get the setting you want  .

overall it is streamlined the camera has had a overhaul  .

it is much more fitting the category of a prosumer camera then the versions that came before with the hot shoe and 2  .

5 lcd a long awaited addition  .

it still holds true to being a point and shoot by being simple to use and figure out  .

two of its best selling points , aa batteries and a flip lcd are still there  .

more few more options have been added without taking away any of the previous ones for s2 and s3 users who own the lens and batteries already and still want more out of their camera this is a great buy  .

the upgrade from the s3 is noticeable and more then the casual user will most likely make it worth the money for a new user to the s series the 500 dollar starting price it is probably not be the best buy for you that amount of money  .

once it drops in price then it would be in the right price range  .

particularity for those who want the ability to choose their own settings and do not want the hassle of owning a slr and multiple lenses with the panasonic fz50 and sony h9 , canon really should have done more to make the s5 standout from the competition and worth its high price tag  .

the s5 is now where the s series should be , features , settings and a hot shoe .

creates quality video and photos but the lens has a history of jamming (lens error , please restart) and the lens cap is designed to fall off excellent optical zoom , but that is marred by the lens error occurring at maximum zoom poor battery life meant i had to carry a lot of spare aa love the adjustable lcd (one of the reasons i went with the s5is) , chdk support and ease of use i'm torn on this camera  .

i like the results and usability but have concerns over durability and reliability .

get yourself the canon sx100  .

way better camera  .

smaller and cheaper too  .

bought it in oct 07  .

took about 1 , 600 pictures on it and then it froze , turned itself off and has been in b  b y's repair place for now the 3rd time  .

i guess if it is not fixed this time i get a new camera  .

no one else on any forum has had the problems i have had  .

evidently , fate has chosen me to have a lemon camera  .

i still think it is a fantastic camera       just wished it worked  .

had to buy a little kodak z885 because i have to shoot a relative's wedding next week  .

it works .

originally owned the s2 is (5 mp) which is excellent  .

along came the s3 is (6 mp) which is great , but i noticed that problems began to arise with the s3 is at the long end of the lens  .

although this is an issue , i managed to work through the gripes  .

now , here we sit chatting about the s5 is (8 mp) version of the same camera with a bit more beef (not choice grade either)  .

the bottom line here folks is that you had better not expect a grand leap if you already own the s3 is  .

rather , be prepared to be very dismayed with the results  .

the s3 is produces much sharper and color    accurate images than the s5 is  .

additionally , the s5 is has a problem with lens creep (for those of you who have not used it extensively and found this out as of yet)  .

in reference to the batteries being placed with the sd slot , i feel that it is not even a relevant issue given that its so trivial compared to the poor image quality  .

i did not return the s5 is , but i did give it to my nephew given that i knew i would take a 25% restocking fee hit which wasnt acceptable  .

hell have plenty of fun with the camera and enjoy it for what its worth (not much of anything imho)  .

the bottom line , if youre going to spend this much money on the s5 is , then youre making a mistake  .

buy the nikon d40x or the sony alpha (or other comparable dslr) which would be money well spent on quality  .

in conclusion , on a scale of 1 to 10 , i would rate this unit as a 5 to be fair given the problems with the images  .

as a side note , i would like to add that i am a professional photographer who likes to carry around spur    of    the    moment cameras that take good pictures , and i argue that the s5 is is one that should be avoided  .

thanks for listening .

this is a good camera but like another poster stated it is not leaps and bounds better than the s3  .

maybe it is just a sign that i am ready for a dslr  .

i don't know what i is expecting but i is hoping for something better than the s3 when it comes to noise on higher iso settings  .

i do take quite a few lower light shots the video does not not look good enough to compete with a camcorder so it is a wasted feature imho  .

i am going to keep it but i am going to start shopping for a dslr  .

if you have a s3 then keep it .

once again canon rests on its laurels  .

rather than come out with a camera that could blow away their competition (which they could do easily)they make modest changes that keep them with the rest of the pack  .

they do not give enough features or improvements to justify an upgrade  .

maybe they do not want to cut into their slr product line  .

i upgraded from a s3 and i wish i listened to the other review  .

i am not that impressed with the s5  .

it is a slight improvement over the s3 with some added features but not what i expected  .

it is still a good camera but nothing groundbreaking .

canon has a significant design flaw with the lens mechanism  .

in earlier canon series this is known as the e18 error , now it's renamed the lens error  .

the lens will not fully extend into position for use and the camera lcd goes black with lens error in white across the bottom  .

this is a widespread issue , simply google e18 error for yourself in my case , canon claims that the camera had been subjected to moisture , which is not true  .

i bought it at christmas time and the failure happened in april , i had done almost zero outdoor shooting since it is winter  .

i will escalate my complaint within canon to see where that leads , but i fully believe that canon has denied my claim to prevent a repeat of the class    action lawsuit that they saw last year on this very issue the camera is fast and ok to use while we had it  .

the controls baffled my techno    challenged wife , so be warned that novice technologists will not know how to use it .
