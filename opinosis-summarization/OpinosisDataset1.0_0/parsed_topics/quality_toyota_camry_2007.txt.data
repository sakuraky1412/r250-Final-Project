 i previously owned a toyota 4runner which had incredible build quality and reliability .

i bought the camry because of toyota reliability and quality .

i purchased a 2007 camry because of the looks of the redesigned model and because of the  legendary  toyota quality and reliability .

 as of today, i am a bit disappointed in the build quality of the car .

 disappointed in interior and exterior quality .

 toyota did a great job with design but forgot about quality !

 this car needs quality improvement !

 the fit and finish in the cabin is not the level of quality i expected .

this car looks great and the build quality is good .

 i am so disappointed in the quality .

i've had 2 camry's before the one, and bought it thinking that the quality standards known to a toyota would still remain excellent .

 it's now apparent that toyota quality took a nose dive .

 mine suffers from the tranny slip   on the 3, 4 upshift when cold, build quality is good but nothing like the toyota, hype i was expecting, as it has its share of squeaks and rattles just like a 10 year old chevy .

 overall a good car, no build quality issues yet .

after owning a 95 camry, i expected the same quality .

 the quality of construction, ride, quietness, and legroom are excellent .

 a lot of defects that i still do not understand how my car passed the quality inspection when it was manufactured .

this car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage 

 jbl radio is low quality cd, fm, and mp3 all sound the same .

 it has high quality amazing ride and the fit and finish is great .

 however, the quality of this car is not acceptable for toyota standards .

 initial quality was lacking and it's only getting worse .

 this is our 6th toyota and we continue to receive the quality we expect .

s not worth buying given the quality issues .

 seems the company's quest to be #1 has caused quality issues .

 interior quality is very poor .

 this was the 7th camry and the last, i feel toyota quality is slipping big time .

 this is not the toyota quality i was expecting .

 interior exterior quality is very good .

 overall build quality very good .

 replaced speakers with sony speakers, sound quality improved .

 the ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship camry .

 it's not a terrible car by any means, but the quality since they starting building them in america has really slipped .

 horrible quality of interior .

 some have mentioned disappointing build quality .

as compared to my wife's 2004 highlander, my new camry does not exhibit the same build quality .

 while i applaud the new design  , toyota seems to be slipping in quality .

 examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily .

 the ride, the fit and the build quality are what i was expecting after owning toyotas in the past .

 this 2007 is the epitome of the toyota's quality .

 i also am not impressed with the quality .

 the sound quality is excellent and answering or dialing a call couldn't be easier .

 solid, high quality, comfortable and quiet .

 depends on gas quality & wind conditions .

 the fit and finish quality is poor .

 toyota's quality is slipping .

 i paid for quality & all i've gotten thus far is not quality  .

 i drive   quality cars and i can attest to the fact this car rides as well as some cars costing considerably more .

 it is a pleasure to drive and it has toyota quality written all over it .

great performance, great gas mileage  , superior quality ,  i always thought of a camry as just a practical family sedan .

 quality of assembly is outstanding .

 toyota has this  supposed  impecable quality .

 so far the quality appears to be strong, as expected .

 high quality inside outside finish

 the quality of the leather seats appears to be very good .

my third camry and by far the worst, the paint is of poor quality .

 some quality issues with fit and finish .

 i have rattles on both b pillars and the build quality is rather poor, with unsightly gaps in the passenger side dash where it does not fit together properly .

 transmission hunts for gears, ride quality much worse than even a mediocre car, auto sound level doesn't work, accessory outlets do not work unless car is running or acc is on  , radio shuts off when engine is shut off .

 excellent interior build quality .

 was sold by the reputation for quality, reliability, and the 2007 redesign .

 vehicle ride is extremely smooth, compliant and quiet ,  very close to lexus quality   for thousands of dollars less .

 the new 2007 camry should have the higher quality than 1997 carmry, but not in my case .

i just feel the car is quality throughout .

 the 07 camry is a high quality car at a very affordable price .

 however, the quality is absolutely terrible for a toyota .

 i will keep this car, but i hope toyota improves their quality to their older standards of the mid 90s .

 my transmission works seamlessly and there are no quality issues whatsoever .

 i was driving 91 camry for long time and it's quality deeply impressed me .

 while i love the design, the poor components, sub, par fit, and, finish, poor quality control, and unreliable work on the part of dealership techs will make me question the quality of any future toyota vehicle .

 i love the car's visual and aesthetic design, but quality is just as important and for that reason, i would not recommend the new camry to anyone !

i had always heard that toyota had the best quality cars .
