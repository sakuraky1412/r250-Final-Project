as a guest since 1999 i emailed my favorite hotel but they did not answer me .
i then booked through internet and arrived after a long drive from bayreuth at around 3pm .
there for the first time i was told to pay upfront but no proof of payment was offered .
i for the first time since 1999 was given a room facing the loud road that stank of desinfectants . . .
i the proceeded to the restaurant knese where after eating i was refused the 20 % discount still mentioned on the website .
when complaining to the hotel i was insulted by the staff at the reception , using an unmentionable word , because i dared to complain about the payment without proof .
i emailed the gm regarding the problem , but it seems the staff can read all email , so i was insulted by a young lady who said she could do it as she already was off the job .
the room itself had a mattress that sagged under my weight , which with 102 kg is quite usual in the western world .
having been insulted for asking for a discount they still advertise at their website , i wisely decided not to ask for remedies .
i emailed the general manager , who i knew since 1999 but got no answers ( i can forward those to tripadvisor if necessary ) .
all good has to end , sadly this ended badly , and plaza berlin hotel will never see me again . . . .
