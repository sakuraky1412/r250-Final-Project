now the down side of this resort which may or may not bother you - the site is under the flight path of incoming planes , the site is not very disabled friendly with steps up to the bar and steps down to the bar toilets and the 15 min walk on the pavements outside leading to the restaurants and bars are not well maintained for wheelchairs .
