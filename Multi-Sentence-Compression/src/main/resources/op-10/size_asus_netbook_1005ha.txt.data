0 out of 5 stars PERFECT SIZE NETBOOK, September 23, 2009
His full sized laptop dies after about 2 hours of use .
Smaller size videos   play even smoother .
Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .
The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .
If I were looking to get work done quickly, I would pay the extra money to go full, sized, even if it's slower .
The screen size works just fine for me .
It's 90% size keyboard doesn't take too long to get used to .
Surprisingly readable screen for the size .
The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .
