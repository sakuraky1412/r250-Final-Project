for the past year or so i 've been getting online offers to stay at the d. my sunday - thursday offer was stay one night at club rate ( $ 22 ) and get one night free .
i 'm not a big gambler , but i joined the ( free ) d 's players club and played some 25 cent slots in the past there .
anyway , i added 2 more nights at $ 22 per night ( and no resort fee ) for a total of $ 66 for 4 nights ( $ 16 .
first , when i arrived , the bathroom floor was n't completely swept and there was soap scum in the soap holder ( 1 ) .
if you prefer a quieter scene , head upstairs one floor where you 'll still find slots that take real coins , 50 's and 60 's music , and the old-fashioned sigma derby horse racing machine ( get there early to get a seat ) .
second , at night , i could see the window was covered in fingerprints ( 2 ) .
50 a night ( and no resort fee ) , i 'll stay there again on my next solo trip .
the new d grill ( coffee shop ) is one of the best in las vegas , in my opinion .
the room had new ( very ) comfy beds , furniture , and hdtv .
the d is good but not perfect ( yet ) .
