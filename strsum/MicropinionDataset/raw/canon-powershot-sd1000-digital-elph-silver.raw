$$;
Pros:. Camera is small - light - takes excellent pictures in all modes - good battery life. 
Cons:. None after three months. 
Summary:. Purchased two SD1000s for two of my grand-children who are over 19 years of age. After three months they both love this camera and the pictures they have taken with it. Each of them have taken over 500 pictures and have no complaints.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wonderful face dection. 
Cons:. Confusion settings. 
Summary:. I love the quality of my pictures look so wonderful.. its also wonderful how it comes with basically everything you need right off the bat.. Small very small im able to have it in my pocket with no problemo.. I highly recommend these for people who just want to point then shoot haha.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast Startup, vitrually no shutter speed, takes fantastic images, wonderfully designed. 
Cons:. Nothing important. 
Summary:. If you want a reliable, new, camera that takes fantastic images and is wonderfully designed. Look no further. This is the camera for you.. Even though it might not have a lot of manual controls, they are still sufficiant.. Parfect. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image processor. 
Cons:. cannot print date on pictures. 
Summary:. This is the best camera you can buy... At least on its class. It is incredibly fast!!! It is also very small and its case and feeling is awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. face detect clever ********. 
Cons:. the AF-assist beam lighte is strong. 
Summary:. This camera is a great deal. It has every thing i thought about. this camera is very clever it deal with it flash in an amazing way to bring the best image. the macro mode is v.good. every thing in this camera is V.good. and about the AF-assist beam you can turn it off when it became noisy like takeing picture to a baby so you don't want him to close his nice eyes.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Speed, Quality. 
Cons:. None that I can find. 
Summary:. Just purchased this camera and could not be more satisfied. It starts up so quickly and the picture quality is incredible. The video it produces when using it as a camcorder is terrific. My first day using it I dropped it onto the kitchen floor from a height of 5 feet and it still worked perfectly afterwards. I purchased a 4GB SD Card and can take thousands of high quality photos.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, Sharp image even at night. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. This is great. Easy to use. Easy to download picture to the computer.. Canon is simply the best in photography!. 

$$;
Pros:. ecellent image quality, all the great new canon technologies.. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. best compact I've ever owned.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, design, ease of use, caseing. 
Cons:. Can't find a fault....... 
Summary:. I have a top of the line Leica and HP digital camera. Neither of them comes close to this Canon when I campare price with features.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small for such high quality. Long lasting battery. Clear photos compared to other cameras. Easy to use. Canons customer service. We accidentally smashed our camera, I called Canon, mailed it to them, they sent it back in two weeks NO QUESTIONS ASKED!. 
Cons:. It doesn't cook me breakfast!. 
Summary:. I'm pretty sure Canon has put out updated models since I bought this in 2005 but if you are picking one up used or as a hand me down, don't let it go.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, high quality photos, reliable, ease of use. 
Cons:. Distance photos with zoom are somewhat grainy. 
Summary:. Great camera that takes excellent photos; can turn off flash and still take good quality indoor photos. I prefer Canon cameras over other brands I have tried. The best thing about this camera is the size! It is very compact yet takes great photos. It is a great all-around digital camera. The only issue I have is when I use zoom to try and take long distance shots; they are grainy. Otherwise, the photos are very high quality and I have been very happy with this camera. I gave one to my son who also loves it. I can carry it easily in a pocket (in a neoprene case). Super camera for the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent quality and really quick use.. 
Cons:. needs a larger screen to meet with today's standards. 
Summary:. If you are looking for the cheapest camera for the best quality and technology, this is the one to choose. The camera retails for $200 but I got an awesome deal for $150. The size is small and stylish, so it is very portable. The screen looks small even though it is 2 inches, but it is not that big of a set back. Do not get it for video quality because the video quality is ok, and not like that of a camcorder. It can be used for close up small videos, but not for recording concerts or anything with a lot of movement. The quality is clear, and when using the camera you don't need the handbook because it is easy to use. I've taken pictures of everything and the quality is comparative to that of an SLR, but an SLR is still better if you want to enlarge your pictures a lot. With looks, quality, and extremely simple use make it the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent photos, easy operation, battery lasts. 
Cons:. No manual controls. 
Summary:. I have a Nikon SLR Digital and I prefer this for 9 out of 10 situations. It is compact, very functional, easy to use, easy to recharge the battery which last long, and the prints are in most cases every bit as good as my Nikon. This camera excels in daylight and close flash situations. The autofocus is very good. With the price drop, it's a great choice for under $200. My 11 year old was able to operate it right away, and my loves it. It was a great replacement for her Kodak, which shut down suddenly and ate up batteries. Fits in pocket or purse so you can always have it available. My Nikon is big and bulky by comparison.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick, easy to use, user friendly, excellent picture quality, modifiable. 
Cons:. can be a little slow when taking a lot of picutres in a row. 
Summary:. This is a great little camera for the money. Definitely one of the best that I've owned. Not only is it fast, sleek and easy to tote around, the functionality is unsurpassed. If you really get into the picture modification features of the camera, there are so many options. Just to name one of the many, they have a snow option for when there's a lot of glare during winter/skiing pictures. You're also able to adjust light balance and a number of other things just by scrolling through the function options (when set on manual).. Even if you don't get into all the fancy stuff, it's a great basic use camera. The micro-view (the little flower on the D-pad) takes great up-close pictures. (generally used for flowers, etc) and the opposite for the larger views (mountains, etc).. I would suggest this camera to anyone who wants to make a versatile investment in a well-rounded camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sturdy design and fast response. 
Cons:. Face recognition doesn't always work properly, no battery charge indicator.. 
Summary:. The camera takes very good pictures be it indoors or outdoors. The response is very fast i.e. the picture doesn't take too long to store on the card. The face recognition doesn't work always, especially when the light is low. The other con is that there is no battery charge indicator.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, video quality, price, size, design. 
Cons:. Proprietary battery. 
Summary:. I bought it in Circuity city during Thanksgiving sale of 2007 for $160.. I read reviews in cnet and the camera made me happy. It takes nice pictures and videos. Good battery life, light weight, design, nice size are some of the best qualities.. I would recommend this to people who want a nice little camera for personal use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Pics even in low light, everything about it really. 
Cons:. none really to speak of. 
Summary:. I bought this camera in June of 2007 and since then it produced nothing but absolutely great shots! It was easy to use but provided more control than the average sub-compact camera. It was worth far more than I paid for it!. In December I accidentally broke it (no fault of the manufacturer, it was purely my own fault!) I would have replaced it with the same one but I really want the wide-angle lens of the SD870 IS. This camera truly was the best camera I had ever used. In fact, because of my experience with this camera and the great pics that came from it, three of my friends bought one and are loving it too!. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed of focus, acquisition, storage, review, start-up, shutdown, zoom. Everything.. 
Cons:. Proprietary battery runs out too soon. Computer software and USB recognition could be easier to use. It is good at being a camera, bad at being a flash drive.. 
Summary:. I have been an amateur photographer for a great many years. As a fan of the candid, shoot everything approach, I knew I wanted a small, compact digital camera that could 'always be there'. This Canon PowerShot SD1000 is everything I could have hoped for and more. I bought it for the ridiculous member price of $140 at BJ's Wholesale on impulse knowing that I either wanted a PowerShot or a Coolpix. I could not be happier.. I can take out this camera, turn it on in less than 1 second, and take up to 3 pictures per second. The focus, zoom and image quality is outstanding.. My complaints:. It is very difficult to get this thing to work with my computer. And I am a software engineer. It has only been a few days since I filled up my memory cards and I lost the card reader (DOH) which WAS easy to use.. It's a simple fix, but a slight nuisance.. The card reader I purchased separately as part of a Targus case, card reader and tri-pod bundle. Also a great buy.. Overall, I rate this CAMERA a 10 for ALL its positives. I absolutely love it. For the money, if this is the type of camera you want then you can't go wrong. Ease of shooting. A+++. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, amazing images, and Fun controls. 
Cons:. Nothing, really. 
Summary:. I just got this camera, and I am really loving it. It has a 7.1 MP Sensor which can capture great photos, and it uses Canon's DIGIC III Processor, so you get Face Detection. All in all, it's an amazing camera. Images turned out crisp and colorful, and Canon's lenses (i think) just make all the difference. There was one slight problem when I went to go print out my Picture on my printer it was kinda blurry and inky, but I probably just didn't set the options correctly. One amazing camera, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great camera for Under $200.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size, terrific images. Seemingly great build quality.. 
Cons:. Could look less like a box.. 
Summary:. I love this camera. It completely obliterates the competition when it comes to image quality. Canon is the only way to go with digital cameras. I mistakenly purchased a Casio Exilim at a cheaper price and ended up returning it for this. Great upgrade from my old Kodak V530. Come to think about it... that looked like a box too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tiny with many features. 
Cons:. No image stablization. 
Summary:. Really small fits in to any pocket. I would expect more from canon but you can only fit so much in to such a small package.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, size, lcd res., metal body, speed, pic quality. 
Cons:. low light noise if settings not right. 
Summary:. After a few days of research, comparisons, and reading cnet reviews, I finally decided on this camera and was not disappointed. In comparison, cameras in the same price range with optical stabilization had a lower res. lcd and were much larger. (a720is) Pocket cameras with 8Mp and stabilization were priced $100 more, which I couldn't justify. (sd850is) I've taken many photos with this camera and so far have not been disappointed with clarity and am wondering how important OIS is on a camera with 3x or 4x optical zoom? Personally, I don't think it's worth the extra money, this camera does just fine without it. Lastly, if you want a fast camera, this is it. Many friends tell me how slow their camera is as far as shutter lag and shot-to-shot time. I can fire off shots like crazy with the sd1000 which is important to everyone, I think.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small Size, Picture Quality in normal light condition. 
Cons:. Picture Quality is not super in night/indoor, quality lower when zoom used. 
Summary:. Great thing about this camera is very small. its about same size as average cell phone you can carry it in pocket. takes very good quality pictures. This camera replaced my older Canon S2 IS, I wanted something small so I can carry to places I wasn't with S2. Its only been 2 week since I made purchase and have taken bunch of pictures and so far very satisfied with my purchase overall great buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent picture quality, sleek design, easy to use. 
Cons:. none found yet. 
Summary:. This is a top of the line camera that takes amazing quality pictures that will blow you away. I upgraded to this camera from a Sony Cybershot which I loved and I found myself now a believer in Canon. The SD1000 is easy to use very slim and sleek, more so than many cell phones and no other camera will match its picture quality from what ive seen. Overall an exellent camera, highly recomended!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb Image Quality, georgeous screen, very small and pocketable, great macro mode. 
Cons:. No image stabilization, some purple fringing and red eye. 
Summary:. This camera is a great choice if you want something that takes excellent images and is very easy to carry in a pocket. My only complaint is not having image stabilization, but the majority of my photos aren't blurry anyway. I was going to get the SD800is but this is smaller and costs less. I think that I'd be happy with either one since Canon makes great cameras.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, features, Price Image quality particualy colours. 
Cons:. slight graininess when dark... 
Summary:. I bought this camera about a week ago and absolutely love it, the easy to use but extensive features make it a lot of fun. Such features like to ability to grey out all colours but one or colour swap are a great novelty! Only slight complaint is that when zoomed to 100% on the computer there is a slight graininess at night with the flash but i am not really complaining would recomend it to anyone who doesnt want to spend a fortune but wants something quiality!. 

$$;
Pros:. IMAGE QUALITY (obviously most important). Great design, fast speed, decent video quality, optical viewfinder. 
Cons:. Lack of OIS, but then again that's why it's much cheaper than the SD800 or SD850. Cosmetically, it does not look as sexy as the SD750.. 
Summary:. Lack of manual exposure settings? Is CNET on crack, or did they not even bother to go into Manual Mode? You can change ISO (with a simple press of the UP key) and even shutter speed (in the function settings)! The only thing you can't set manually is the f-stop/aperture setting. Very few (if any) ultracompact cameras will let you adjust these.. Image quality is beautiful! Good color balance &#38; auto white balance, strong low-light performance, and a very smart flash that doesn't cause too much glare. Many cameras today will blast the flash too strongly. I shoot most of my pictures at ISO 200 or under, so image noise is very low (almost non-existent at ISO 80). I really would not recommend shooting anything at ISO 1600 because they are really terrible. Even when resized to 640x480 they are still bad. Images come out sharp and detailed even when zoomed in to native resolution, though low-light pictures will always be of reduced quality.. It is a super tiny camera (0.8 inches thick) and a nice boxy feeling. It feels much nicer and intuitive than those so-called "ergonomic" curvy cameras. It has the best mode switcher in any camera--a simple slider that switches from camera, video camera, and playback. Very nifty!. It would be nice to have a dedicated button to change EV compensation (Yes, you can use the programmable button to do this but I use it to record video instantly).. There is no Optical Image Stabilization on this baby, but then again that feature's overrated and overhyped anyway. It's really only useful in low light situations and with no flash. Most people will use flash in most low-light situations anyway, so why do you even need image stabilization?. You can set shutter speed down to 15 seconds to do a long exposure for a night scene, but make sure the camera is on a hard surface when you do it.. The optical viewfinder is tiny and annoying to use, but hey at least it HAS a viewfinder. Many ultracompact digicams today are completely reliant on the LCD screen, like the PowerShot SD750. Note that though the SD750 has a 3" screen, it is still the same pixel resolution (230,000 pixels) as the SD1000.. And last of all, compatibility with Windows XP is excellent. I have it set up so that plugging in the USB cable to the camera (it's always plugged into the computer) will automatically create a dated folder, copy all of the files in the camera into that folder, and delete them off the camera. I don't even have to do anything except click OK twice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use from the start up. 
Cons:. software leaves a lot to be desired. 
Summary:. I bought this (And an Olympus FE190) to have quick point and shot capabilities. What I got was one great camera. Takes clean pictures that come out great when printed thru sites like Walgreens.com. The software canon uses could do more, but then there are pleanty of editing programs out there I guess.. 

$$;
Pros:. light, fast power up, easy for beginners, extra settings for intermediates. 
Cons:. no battery life indication until battery is almost drained.. 
Summary:. I had the same problems in low light as mentioned in a few of the other reviews however, a little tinkering with the ISO and the night picture settings and I was getting pictures that were just as clear as in normal light. It's an exremely easy camera to use if you just want to point and click, but if you take the time select the right focus and light levels, you can get some incredible detail.. Keep in mind how little you are spending and how compact this camera is.. Note: Spare batteries are about 10% the cost on popular auction sites. Don't buy them in the store when you get your camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of Use/Size/Picture Quality/Fun video clips. 
Cons:. None noticed. 
Summary:. I purchase this camera at Best Buy ($217--price matched Circuit City) last month for my son to take on trip to Germany. He came back with 600 pictures and 30+ video clips. All the pictures were in perfect focus including several taken from a car going approx. 100 mph on autobahn of a Ferari going even faster. I just didn't see where image stabilization was an issue except possibly when he was taking video clips while riding a bike of other kids with him also riding their bikes. Video was a little shaky but he was hitting bumps!. With this camera he went from rarely taking a picture to wanting to take it everywhere with him. He also used the music clip feature and recorded a few songs! Great camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good video, slick design, nice outdoor shots, good software package. 
Cons:. Pixel burnout on video in direct sun, weak flash, ok battery life. 
Summary:. I bought the SD1000 for a trip to Europe, and took it for a testdrive in the states for a few days. I bought a 4gb SDHC card (which is compatible with the SD1000) and took it wakeboarding. I had great video (30 minutes with a 4 gb card) and was very pleased. Of all the clips I took, one particular clip that had a shot with direct evening sun had a band of pixels from top to bottom that stayed for the duration of the video. I also used the packaged software (Photostitch) that came with it, and took panoramic shots of the lake. Very good, but there was some dark fringing on the edges that even though the picture stictched seamlessly, you could tell where the edges of the 3 photos were.. In Europe I used it extensively for indoor and outdoor shots. Here is what I found. Outdoors, it does very well and gives great composition with good detail. Indoors, you should put it down somewhere and hold it against something that doesn't move, otherwise, the weak flash doesn't do much. I went to the Parliament Hall in Bucharest (the 2nd largest building by volume in the world) and the vast expanses of space made it almost impossible to use the flash, but I was able to get good photos by either holding it against a column or placing it on the ground. I read extensive reviews between this camera and the SD850IS and the SD750 and the SD900, and I came to this conclusion, that the Image Stabilization feature doesn't compensate for a good flash or a tripod. In this category of camera, your best bet is to get the best lens and image processor, and hope for the best in lighting conditions.. I can't say enough about the program Photo Stitch. It works good, and I have been taking panorama shots like mad. One thing to keep in mind is that if you stand in one place and mark the areas where the image ends, you will stitch a photo together only to find that you have a fisheye view of the place. Being such a small lens, there is a great deal of distortion, and the larger the area you stitch together, the greater will be the distortion (I have done up to 5 photos together). Still, it's a neat program, and it has been helpful.. 

$$;
Pros:. For Mom, but daughter took it to Africa for 6 weeks. 
Cons:. really nothing bad to say. 
Summary:. Got it for Mom to take to school, etc while teaching, but our daughter took it to Africa with a couple of 2 Gig SD cards and has NO complaints. Seems a good choice and it was on discount at Circuit City for much below the suggested 250.. 

$$;
Pros:. MANUAL CONTROLS, fast shutter, fast start up time, crisp pictures, great macro, color accent mode. 
Cons:. Box shape is painful in the pocket, SD card slot is next to battery. 
Summary:. Why is Cnet's con no manual controls when in the ******* menu it clearly has a manual mode where you can change anything you want? The only con I have with this camera is its shape and metal body, older elphs were much sexier. Neat to think a tiny pocket camera has a better processor than the Canon Rebel XT.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feature rich, user friendly and great quality. 
Cons:. USB Cover is plastic and feels a bit flimsy. 
Summary:. This is a great camera for the money. The picture quality is great given the compact size. Very portable and great for on the go. Battery lasts a very long time. I have not experienced the poor picture quality that some others have noted on here. I did notice a bunch of these cameras on Ebay and I am wondering if they are just knock-offs given the reviews. I bought mine from a large box store and I love the camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fits in a shirt pocket; very fast in getting ready and when you push the shutter; has been a reliable backup to my digital SLR. 
Cons:. haven't found one yet. 
Summary:. Recommended for all of the above reasons. 

$$;
Pros:. Face Detection is wonderful, takes great shots. Lots of scene features. 
Cons:. Lack of Stablization is something that I wish this camera had. Video is good, but needs work. The digital zoom is good, but I found the pictures are not as crisp as they should be.. 
Summary:. This is the best camera I'm had. I've owned the Powershot 350, Sony Mavica and now the SD1000. I did my research on it, it has great reviews. It takes great shots. I love to take pictures of wild flowers, and the macro feature lets me get up close without becoming fuzzy. If you're going to spend money on a new camera, this is the camera you should have. You won't be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. small, easy to use. 
Cons:. can't think of any. 
Summary:. good camera, good value. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact Small Design, Features, Quality. 
Cons:. Battery/Memory Card Cover. 
Summary:. I looked at Quite Few Camera before Purchasing this Little Camera. I owned Canon Camcorder and very pleased with it so Canon was my First Choice. I looked SD550 but It didn't have Lithium Rechargeable Battery, instead had Regular AA Batteries.. I was looking for Budget of Within $150.00 But looking around and reading reviews of this Camera which is mostly Positive. I bought it and received 2 days ago and this is defiantly worth $215.00. It is very Small, Built Quality looks very Strong, Picture Quality is Superb.. Only thing looks to be Concern about it Battery/Memory Card Cover, which is attached to camera with simple weak looking plastic clip. That is the only thing looks to be careful about when used.. I wish Canon would have offered to buy extra warranty on this Camera on their Site. I bought this from Amazon.com and I don't like third party warranty after reading reviews on it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Ease of Use, and Picture Quality. 
Cons:. Separate Battery Charger. 
Summary:. I had the SD600, but soon lost the charger. I liked my SD600 so much that I replaced it with the SD1000. I am disappointed that you still have to carry the additional charger if you think you will need to charge your batteries. That is my only quibble.. Other than that, the camera takes great pictures, is a bit faster than the SD600, and looks better. I like small, simple and compact designs and this camera is all of that.. It is the camera I take with me everywhere it is flawless other than the whole charger issue.. 

$$;
Pros:. Portability, functions, pictures. 
Cons:. Covers for battery and USB Port. 
Summary:. I have had mine about a week now. I read the entire manual and after that, it is really very intuitive. There are functions that I will never use, but the ones that I may use are easy to find. I can set a particular function for just one shot, which I like. I love the quality of the pictures and it has worked in all levels of light. It is the perfect size for travel when you don't want to carry a large bag, since it can fit in my pocket, on my belt, or around my neck on a chain.. My only complaint is the covers. Since I have to take the battery out to charge it, I wish the battery cover was all metal. The same with the USB port, why put a cover on a USB port anyway? I fear that since I will have to open and close these covers in order to use the camera that they are a possible weakness. However, my last Sony was the same way and the covers never broke, maybe because I am very careful with them.. Joey. 

$$;
Pros:. Awsome Pictures, it offers a retro look for old school picture takers. Extremely small, new digi processer, face recognition, red eye removal. 
Cons:. Some people may not like the boxy shape or the retro look. Menu system could be better. 
Summary:. Ive only spent 30 minutes with this camera at ABC warehouse. It was enough to convince me to buy it though. I strongly recommend this camera for someone looking in the $200-$250 range. The pictures are excellent, just as it says in the CNET review.. 

$$;
Pros:. slim, light and compact, ISO can up to 1600.. 
Cons:. Non-all weather, non waterproof.. 
Summary:. This is my 1st digital camera, all i can say is it very value for money, suitable for beginner since all the feature easy to master in one night.. 

$$;
Pros:. Optical View Finder, Compact Size, Construction, ISO Settings. 
Cons:. Weak Flash, Optical Viewfinder shows different area than Screen. 
Summary:. This is my 4th digital camera and my first sub-compact. The camera is basically the size of a deck of cards so it's slightly bigger than some Sony, Fuji and Casio Exilim models. However, Sony and Fuji use Memory Stick Pro and XD cards which would require me to re-buy all my storage I use for my other cameras. If you look at all the cameras the other manufacturers put out, you'll be hard pressed to find one with an Optical Viewfinder.. The view finder isn't perfect however as it seems to show less of an area than the camera actually captures and it only shows the optical zoom, it doesn't do anything to compensate for digital zoom so you'll have to use the screen for that.. With a camera this small, you unfortunately cannot get them that take AA Batteries so I would say an additional NB-4L battery is a must. However, the battery seems to last a LONG time...especially if you turn off the screen on the back as I do a lot.. The first picture from start up is VERY fast, however you have to hit the Power button on top of the camera and then move your finger over to the shutter button....just pressing the shutter doesn't turn on the camera like some models.. I checked out all the Fuji, Olympus, Panasonic (Lumix), Casio (Exilim), and Kodak subcompacts - had heard bad things about HPs so I never checked them - and the features/size to cost ratio of this camera is unbeatable.. The screen on the back is going to get covered with smudges with regular use, there's no way around that, but the one handed menu system works quite well. It's VERY easy to do access every feature and function with only your right hand on the camera allowing you to solely use the left for stabilization. I wish the camera had some kind of image stabilization, but no sub-compacts have the feature.. Overall, a GREAT subcompact that won't replace a DSLR or Prosumer model like the S1/S2/S3 IS, but is the perfect little camer to stash in your pocket for the times you don't want lug around all your gear.. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive UI, great image quality, small charger, small/lightweight, time-lapse movie. 
Cons:. difficult zoom controls, slightly flimsy playback/capture-mode switch. 
Summary:. Lots of great features, and size/weight is fantastic (it's tiny). Images are crisp and sharp. Big LCD is nice. Love the small charger, so you can take it on the road [battery charger has plug prongs that fold out of the charger; no extra cable to carry]. Camera starts FAST and takes pics immediately.. Time-Lapse Movie mode is completely cool!!. Slightly flimsy playback/capture-mode switch (but no big deal really). Overall I LOVE the camera. I posted a review on expoTV.com -- would highly recommend this one for point-and-shoot users who still want decent control/features and good images.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome pictures, tiny size, full feature set. 
Cons:. No manual controls. 

$$;
Pros:. Take great, clear pictures. No fuzziness.. 
Cons:. Can't think of any cons. 
Summary:. I originally bought the Casio Exilim V7 and was so disappointed at the focus of the camera. Simple pictures came out poorly.. After doing some more research and returning the Casio, I bought the Canon Powershot SD1000 and just love it.. It is small enough for me to carry in my purse and therefore take more pictures. I like the look and feel of the camera and the fact that it takes great, clear pictures.. DW. 

$$;
Pros:. Tiny enough to carry in purse; large LCD screen; got a free photo printer with it!. 
Cons:. Haven't found any yet. 
Summary:. I just got this camera this week so I'm still learning - it's my first digital and I love it. Can anyone tell me if I need an extra battera or the AC adapter? How long does the battery typically last? Thanks!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to hold while taking pictures; amazing focus. 
Cons:. Doesn't have image stabilization. 
Summary:. I've used both Canon &#38; Sony cameras/camcorders, &#38; feel Canon has a higher quality product. The face detecting technology is amazing! The pictures I've taken are very sharp. The camera, although boxy, is well-designed, so it could be easily held with one hand to take pictures. The only downside is that this model doesn't have the image stabilization as the SD800 IS. Unless you are willing to spend an additional $100 for the SD800 IS, the SD1000 is the way to go!.

Pros:. Small Size, photo quality. 
Cons:. No Battery indicator, but none others. 
Summary:. The Canon Powershot SD1000 is a great camera packed into a tiny size. It has a 2.5in LCD with a view finder. The overall set up is very simple and easy to use. It has a power flash and good zoom.. I Highly recommend it. It even tells you how many pictures are able to fit on the SD disk. Even when you are changing setting, which impact the space needed for a picture.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple and sturdy design, hides all the technology it packs a punch. Digic III with face recognition works great.. 
Cons:. ISO 1600 is good, but not any different than using ISO 800. Stick to 800. 
Summary:. This highly anticipated camera is well worth the money. It takes the best pictures in its class. The design is simple and easy to navigate. The buttons may be small for some fingers, but I found it quite useable.. Options such as accenting a certain color makes it standout while toning out other colors in the picture is great. The color swap features is nice too, although not perfect.. Video quality is excellent. Hardly notice it was taken with an instant camera. You can set frames per second to reduce size of recording as well.. The full range of settings to mix &#38; match is nice inside such a small box. It's shorter and thinner than a marlboro cigarette box.. Other cool features:. - vertical/horizontal orientation sensor adjust pictures on the fly.. - Audio recorder.. - Audio recording tag to photos.. - Red-eye correction on playback. - Gridlines assist. - Slideshow playback. Awesome price.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple good looking Design,great quality pictures,nice micro mode pictures. great movie option. simple light compact.. 
Cons:. No battery indicator. hair slow AF in continue shots.. 
Summary:. very simple good looking design ,very light easy to carry everywhere.takes real good pictures. especially micro mode great pictiures. good movie quality. overall great camera with great quality. nice catch!. 

$$;
Pros:. many options like color swap,color accent that can give very interesting background,so you can play with the scenery.great digital macro option for shooting small things.option that can give darker skin tone,more blue,green,red or black/white,sepia... 
Cons:. The thing that would make this camera perfect would be better digital zoom,bigger ISO(which is very good btw),continuos shot,and better flash! I think that autoflash isn't the greatest but it also depend on the photographer,so you need to study all. 
Summary:. Taking into account all,Great and very functional camera,small,nice look,good battery,good options..I recommend to everyone.You certainly won't regret if you buy these product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small!!!!. Optical viewfinder.. 
Cons:. Lackluster low light performance.. No optical image stabilization.. Doesn't take standard "AA" batteries.. 
Summary:. I picked this up for under a $100 on closeout when my Minolta Z3 broke. Although this Canon has more than double the pixel count the Minolta took considerable better pictures. I will never buy another camera without optical image stabilization. For the price it a great little camera that fits in my pocket very easily. I find that I have it on me much more often than I had my Minolta because of the small size.. This Canon is a great "hold me over" until I can afford the Panasonic I really want.. 

$$;
Pros:. good pix in a small frame. 
Cons:. not so good in low light. 
Summary:. all things considered, its a favorite. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent screen, easy to use. 
Cons:. None really. 
Summary:. I looked through various digital cameras. This model is cheap, simple and does what you want from a point and shoot.. 

$$;
Pros:. good picture quality compact feels study easy to use. 
Cons:. slight lag. 
Summary:. best buy for the price. Easy to use did not need to read the manual, if you are technology iliterate then just turn it on and take pictures all the setting are set to auto so there is no need to adjust anything. If you can not figure out how to use this then you should be ashamed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size still fits larger hands, good in-camera editing, simple ISO setting controls, great for a night out if you don't want to carry too much.. 
Cons:. No manual controls, ISO 800 - 1600 photo quality is so-so, extreme close up photos tough to make clear. 
Summary:. I've had this camera for a little while, and on its own merits it is a terrific snapshot camera, a wonderful value for a casual user. Some of the in-camera options are very intuitive, like the in-camera red eye removal tool and other post-shot editing options.. I was looking for a second camera I could use when I simply couldn't have my SLR (which seems to be more and more often these days) and while the photo quality has been excellent, I really don't know why Canon didn't add simple manual controls to this camera. There is a "manual" mode, but this doesn't allow shutter speed / aperture control, just white balance.. Don't misinterpret; the images are very high quality, the camera is very intuitive and I am going to keep using it as a night-on-the-town shooter. I would seriously consider this camera if you are one to just keep it on auto (the camera almost always creates a great shot). Photo junkies, just don't expect to get nearly as creative as you may be used to.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice size camera. 
Cons:. Got snowed on ! so it quit.. 
Summary:. This is a real nice,camera " but ". When taking pictures while it was snowing,. it caused moisture to corrode the interior cards, bought it in Aug.2007 It's worthless now.. Per Canon repair?. So don't plan on using this Little bugger.. in the snow!. I don't recomend it in Michigan. 

$$;
Pros:. Small and compact, excellent photos. 
Cons:. No image stabilizer. 
Summary:. WOW an excellent camera for point and shoot shots, The colour accent and black and white moods give perfect pictures and I was surprised to see how well it could pick up the colours, the colour switch was not to good at all could not switch some colours. The short movie feature was done well and the audio was surprisingly good. Over all I was impressed and would recommend this camera to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. small size,,user friendly controls,beautiful screen,quality pictures. 
Cons:. minimal manual exposure controls. 
Summary:. Obviously some of the nimrods on this page don't understand manual exposure. The only manual exposure controls on this camera are the long shutter control(1-15 sec) and the ISO setting(80-1600). However, the ISO setting you choose will only allow the camera to choose its' computer's algorithm for shutter speed and F-Stop. That is why I listed "minimal exposure controls" as a negative. Otherwise this is a nifty little camera which you can put in your jean/pant pocket. It's the smallest camera that Canon makes(yes, it's smaller and lighter than the SD750!) and my wife always has it in her purse.. The pictures are beautiful and the colors are always true. The screen is great although the viewfinder comes in handy in the bright Phoenix sunshine. Controls are ergonomical and intuitive to use. You won't go wrong with the pocket hercules!. 

$$;
Pros:. Unlike most digital cameras I've used- the pictures come out more clear and well lit without flash in reasonably low light situations. 
Cons:. No image stabilization is frustrating. 
Summary:. I've wanted a DSLR for the LONGEST time, but since it's far out of my price range, I know I shouldn't hold my breath. So I gave up on that long lost dream and instead opted for a nice point and shoot. After looking over a lot of reviews, I decided I'd go with the SD1000.. It's not an SLR- but I'm happily satisfied.. With the proper tweaking (I've found that fooling around with the function settings is well worth it- don't just limit yourself with the auto setting, play around a bit), it produces acceptional quality images in even the most frustrating indoor lighting without having to use that icky flash.. Only thing I'd really love to change is the fact that it has no image stabilization. Unless your subject is standing perfectly still, and your hands are steady, the images turn out blurry. That was my biggest dissapointment. Also, I've read in some reviews that the LCD screen is very sensitive, so I've been extremely careful when handling the camera and decided to purchase a protective case for it.. I'd recommend it if you're looking for great quality on a budget.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the small size. 
Cons:. No negatives. 
Summary:. I love that I can put in my pocket and have available. Pictures turn out great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, easy to operate. 
Cons:. Plastic battery door. 
Summary:. I bought this camera recently to take on a trip to the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas and I couldn't be happier with it. It was fast, easy and took great pictures. We had a double rainbow appear over the canyon while we were there and got great, colorful shots of it. In Vegas, we took actions shots of the Bellagio fountains and were very pleased with the results. You can't get a better camera for the price in my opinion. The only thing that could be impoved is the door for the battery and memory card. It is made of plastic and is somewhat flimsey, but other than that, if you want an inexpensive digital camera that takes great pictures, you won't go wrong with this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size, long battery life, fast startup, short latency, good images, low price. 
Cons:. Minor edge distortion in high-light situations. 
Summary:. Unlike several other reviewers, i have found absolutely no problems taking pictures in low light environments. Auto usually looks fine, but with a little manual tweaking low light photos look nothing short of fantastic. The camera is so small and light you'll never miss another photo opportunity because you'll bring it everywhere. Despite its weight, the case is remarkably solid. There is a bit of distortion, noticably more than my old Canon A75, but the lenses on the SD1000 are much smaller, and distortion is the price you pay for the size. The only times i've found the distortion problematic were taking pictures of trees in very bright conditions. Usually this is manifested as a slight blue outline around the edges of the subject near the very top of the frame. I'd definitely buy it again, i don't think you can beat it for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Alot of features, small size, great picture quality. 
Cons:. some of the features aren't fleshed out (color swap), a greater optical zoom would be nice. 
Summary:. Basically, if you are looking in this price range, buy this camera. Canon is reliable with their product and this camera is no exception. Great pictures, many features make this camera good for any person.. 

$$;
Pros:. great pictures movies, overall performance. 
Cons:. i rather buy the sd600, than this. 
Summary:. overall i believe this is a good camera, but i really did not like the old retro box desine but i think its ok every one has their own opinions, but if you really want a nice looking camera you should buy the sd630 for $250 or if you want the new sd750 go ahead and buy it. 

$$;
Pros:. Image Quality and Price. 
Cons:. No stabilization for images. 
Summary:. The fair price and it's compact size makes it easy to carry in pockets. Good build quality and great image quality makes this a good choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very light and small, great pictures in ideal lighting conditions. 
Cons:. Noisy images at higher ISO settings. 
Summary:. I bought this camera mainly for capturing great moments with friends and fellow musicians that share stages with me and other musical events we participate in together.. I needed a camera that is as small as possible, and relatively inexpensive, and I found this one to be the best I can have for the money and for my needs, according to the reviews I read here before.. First of all, this camera is tiny! whenever I want to capture a moment, I just take it out of my bag, slip it out of the little case (I had to buy for it...) and shoot. Very comfortable to grab and shoot with one hand.. Shooting in sufficient lighting conditions yields very good, sometimes spectacular results, great contrast, lively colors, fine resolution and quite sharp images. The manual white balance presets work very well, as well as the custom balance option. The auto white balance works good most of the time, although sometimes makes for boring colors in the image.. No manual exposure controls, manual shutter speed is 1sec. or more (useless for creative use in daylight shooting). The manual exposure compensation does help a little in balancing the light in the picture.. Shooting in less than ideal lighting conditions yields less than perfect, sometimes less then satisfactory results. Using higher ISO settings (400 or 800) in darker scenes makes for very noisy images, so the compromise is using a flash, which is not always pleasing, or staying with a lower ISO setting, which is almost impossible shooting focused images of people and such things. In these situation I shoot only for capturing the moment purpose, not for really enjoying quality images.. I recommend using the camera in manual mode, even though there are some mistakes at the beginning, I am still not an expert but I am getting better, and I never use the AUTO mode.... Overall, a great camera for the money. If you need more artistic flexibility or better low light results, look for a good SLR camera. But if you need a lightweight, fast Point&#38;Shoot capture the moment solution, look no further. You'll sometimes be surprised by the results.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, multiple settings, movie mode, decent sized LCD viewer. 
Cons:. NO BATTERY LIFE METER! :(. 
Summary:. This is a good little camera overall. It fits in your pocket so you can take it almost anywhere. At 7.1 Mp the photo quality is very good. There are many settings that you can select for various shooting conditions. They can be further tailored in manual mode. It's so easy to use that I was able to figure out how to use it without even reading the manual. The only issue I've had with the camera is that it has no battery life meter. There's no warning until just before the battery goes dead. I think it's a serious omission. You'd better have a spare battery otherwise you can be left with a dead camera and lost memories.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good pictures for small camera. 
Cons:. Function buttons small. 
Summary:. Up set that lens jammed after only one year and cheaper to buy a new camera than have it repaired.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good pictures when it's sunny. 
Cons:. Bad inside or night photos. 
Summary:. When you turn off the flash and it's dark outside it automatically slows the shutter speed and you can't adjust it. You can make the shutter longer, but not faster. So pictures at night turn out blurry. And even pictures taken inside have fuzzy edges. I really hate this camera because of that and I'm buying a different one. If you want sharp pictures in low lighting, this is not the camera for you. But when you're taking pictures outside when it's really sunny it's fine.. 

$$;
Pros:. A good point &#38; shoot camera for the price. Accurate color.. 
Cons:. Blurry images. 
Summary:. I'm a novice photographer who bought the SD1000 hoping it would be an upgrade to my 3 meg Sony DSC. It turns out the 3 meg camera takes crisper photos than the Canon, even when it's on a tripod.. To its credit, the Canon has very accurate color reproduction. Certain colors (like lavender) are very difficult to photograph unless you happen to have good lighting. The Canon captured the color perfectly.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have not bought the camera yet. 
Cons:. I have not bought the camera yet. 
Summary:. I was wondering if anyone had a comment on the video capture quality of this camera. From what I read it looks good. I was looking for a camcorder + digiCam until someone suggested buying this camera for both purposes. Is that a good option ?. TIA. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice features, great screen, compact size. 
Cons:. Shot to shot refresh rate while flash is engaged is poor. 
Summary:. I specifically purchased this camera to eliminate the lag between shots. All of the reference data that I had reviewed show the camera near the top of the ratings for point and shoot cameras. Unfortunately, when the flash is engaged, the performance is not very good. I ran a test against a Canon SD 800, and the difference in performance was appreciable. The 800 was signficantly quicker when the camera was used to take multiple shots in fairly quick sequence. According to Canon Tech Support, the 800 has a stronger battery that provided this quick refresh or minimal shot to shot lag.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tiny, fast, big LCD. 
Cons:. Fuzzy pics, unique batteries,. 
Summary:. This is supposed to be a top-of-the-line pocket camera. Unfortunately it is badly in need of image stabilization. Outside pix are great, but inside there is no way to take without the flash or a tripod. Everything else is fuzzy. In addition, for some reason does not allow you to copy _TO_ the camera, using it as a USB-storage device. Otherwise is great little camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great pictures with sunlight, beautiful video, light, small. 
Cons:. Mottled, noisy pictures when not in sunlight (when at 100% resolution). 
Summary:. I got this camera because I was so impressed with another Canon, the SD550; a friend owned one and had uploaded his photos to my computer and I'd really been amazed at their detail and clarity.. So then I bought this SD1000, expecting even greater things since it was newer. I uploaded some pics to my computer, and I was shocked to discover that, despite its next-generation technology, the SD1000's photos were of much lower quality than the SD550. The sample video I took was great, it was like a camcorder, but the photos looked blotched, noisy and mottled when viewing them at 100%. The SD550's photos, in contrast, looked sharp and detailed.. I tried taking some outdoor pictures in bright sunlight and this mottling and haze mostly went away. But I'm not interested in a camera I can only use when it's sunny. So I'm returning it.. This may not be a problem for you if you only view your photos as small prints; I didn't print any samples to check. As for me, I primarily view my photos on my computer, and I like being able to zoom in to 100% and see crisp detail.. I recommend going to a site like Steve's Digicams and opening up the sample pictures from different cameras in different tabs in your browser. Compare them, going back and forth. When i did this at 100% resolution (browsers resize images to fit in the browser window, so be sure you click on them to resize them to 100%) with the SD550, the SD700IS, the SD1000, the SD800IS, and the SD900, I found that the SD1000's pictures looked the worst of all of them. I showed them to a few friends and they all agreed. The SD1000 had the most noise, the most artifacts. In comparison the SD550 looked the nicest at 100%, with the SD700IS very close behind.. Both of those cameras use the older DIGIC II processor. I think Canon has really taken a step backward with its DIGIC III in terms of image quality, though I guess it allows fancy things like face recognition. But tastes differ, so go check out some sample pics yourself before you buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Build quality; size; ease of use; price; style. 
Cons:. Disappointing photo quality; weak red eye reduction. 
Summary:. I bought the SD1000 back in March 2008 and have used it steadily since. I like the camera, but I'm not that impressed with the photo quality. Images are too often grainy in low light. They also, to my surprise, universally lack sharpness. My previous Canon was a Powershot s50, which yielded images of much higher quality.. I can't say, however, that I dislike the camera as a whole. I love its ease of use and portability -- I've just resigned myself to average image quality. I use photo editing software to despeckle and add sharpness.. Would I buy the camera again? Probably not. I'm a big fan of Canon, though, and would buy a different model in the PowerShot line.. 

$$;
Pros:. Battery life, very compact, good movie quality in low-light conditions. 
Cons:. Fragile!!!! Poor image quality in sunlight. 
Summary:. this camera turned to be a disappointment.. When you take a picture of person's face in the sunlight , the picture shows quite a bit of glare, You alway need to go to manual mode and either use a darker skin tone feature, or just generally darken the image.. the camera had the problem with the lens stuck - has been in the repair on warranty and has the same problem again - pretty much a throwaway material.. In the bright sunlight there is quite a bit of saturation in the corners , understandably due to the size of the lens.. Colors are ok though.. I have had two lower end Canons by now , both produced poor quality images.. 

$$;
Pros:. lots of shooting mode, slim perfect for pockets. 
Cons:. no image stablization, high iso gives image noise. 
Summary:. This is my 1st camera. It seems alright. There is no image stabelization so if you want to take fast pics that do not blur, u need to change into higher iso. However higher iso gives images noise, which makes the image doesn't look very smooth. Battery is decent. Not that bad if you don't use it every single hour.. 

$$;
Pros:. Neat features, great price. 
Cons:. Ridiculously blurry photos. 
Summary:. I bought this camera about a month ago. Whenever I try to take a shot that is not in the "Kids and Pets" mode, I end up having to take the picture like 15 times in order to not get a blurry one. There have been many times when I have completely missed a once-in-a-lifetime shot of my 10 month old niece. She was the whole reason I bought the camera!. It does have its good points like the color swap and accent. Those are cool. Plus, it can take really great pics if you are in the perfect lighting and are shooting something that isn't really moving. Plus, it costs at least $100 less than the ones which seemingly. I am taking this back and forking over the extra 200 bucks for the SD950 IS. This is basically the same camera but with 12.1 megapixels and an Optical Image Stabilizer. I will let yall know how that one works out for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice menu system; small and light. 
Cons:. poor picture quality. 
Summary:. DanM2 is right on target regarding the photo quality of this camera. While I love the SD1000's ease of use and portability, the photos I took generally lacked sharpness and showed a yellowish tinge when printed. This was the case for both outdoor and indoor shots, but was most noticeable in the outdoor shots.. I don't know how CNET does it's reviews, but I have a sneaking suspicion that printed indoor and outdoor photos are not accounted for in their ratings.. 

$$;
Pros:. ultracompact, multiple face detection. 
Cons:. fuzzy, digitized pictures indoors. 
Summary:. I have the same problem as DanM2. I had looked extensively across cameras and manufacturers for a small camera with excellent image quality so I could enlarge my prints. I was very disappointed to find that some of my 4x6 prints had very soft, almost blurred edges and pixelated color. This was especially true indoors when using the flash, but even a couple of my outdoor photos taken in late afternoon (without direct sunlight but not at all dark) were noticeably less sharp than I expected. I am wondering if this is a problem that only a few of us are having, but I've noticed the complaint in a minority of comments on other websites.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stunning outdoor/sunlight, Excellent video. 
Cons:. Unacceptable indoors/night. 
Summary:. My 4 year old S400 takes better photos.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice compact design. 
Cons:. Poor picture quality,bad face detection software. 
Summary:. I have owned this camera for 3 weeks now and I am very dissappointed. People are only giving this camera a good review because it looks nice and because its a canon. The SD1000 has bad picture quality it has the same picture quality as a canon power shot 560. There is lots of noise and soft images with white spots at low ISO setting even in auto mode there is no difference. Face detection seldom works. properly and say for instance you have 2 people in a photo one face will come out sharp and the other soft with noise. I purchased a sony DSC-W80 2 days ago and I will tell you that the sony DSC-W80 is definitly better then the canon SD1000 the image quality is above exellent pictures are sharp without excessive noise even when blown up on your computer moniter and the software isn't buggy like the SD1000.. 

$$;
Pros:. Perfect compact size. 
Cons:. Crappy Prints. 
Summary:. Like a few others I purchased this camera with high hopes of sharp clear images. I got pictures with lots of noise, blurred details and generally unprofessional looking on the computer or prints at high resolution. I am definitely returning this camera, but am afraid of picking up another clunker, and having to keep paying restock fees. I have 2 other digital cams, both in larger sizes, and they take excellent clear pictures. The camera is easy to use and the viewing screen has vivid clear colors. I was really disappointed that I cannot keep this tiny little guy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size &#38; Friendly Menu. 
Cons:. Sub-par image quality &#38; Shutter lag. 
Summary:. I am a "Bang for the Buck" shopper. I researched this camera to death &#38; recently decided to pull the trigger and get it. I have been disappointed since day one. I bought my wife a Nikon Coolpix 7900 Christmas 2005 (Almost 2 years ago) and her Nikon's image quality stomps my Canon's. Also, I believe mine has longer shutter lag. 2 years in the electronics world is forever. Why has there been such a small improvement in digital camera quality? We have compared several pictures taken at the same event with her camera and mine, and there is a remarkable difference in image sharpness....especially indoor pictures. The Canon SD1000 seems to blur edges &#38; very small detail. My wife was envious until she saw my first printed photos. Maybe I got a "Lemon", I don't know, but I have been very disappointed in my new Canon SD1000. By the way, I have no pre-disposition toward Nikon. My mom has an entry level Olympus 7 Megapixel camera that also produces better printed photos than my Canon.. 

$$;
Pros:. View Finder. 
Cons:. No Image Stabilization , Yellow/Purple Color, Battery Door. 
Summary:. I have the upper advantage of rating cameras because I get to not only play with almost everyone of them, but I sell them. Just one advantage is that I get to see what other people say and purchase, and even better I get to see what comes back broken. Another advantage is that I get to see the pictures people take with there cameras from beginners to professionals. I am able to talk to the camera manufactures rep and get all my answers and concerns answered by them as well. All to make my decision on what cameras I would like to sell and purchase for myself.. As far as the Canon SD1000 you need to see both the cons and pros. There is no perfect camera in the world so the name of the game is which one is going to be the best for your needs.. Canon is one of the only manufactures that still believes in the view finder. This is key if you are going to take pictures in the bright sunlight. It doesnt matter if you have a thousand dollar camera of a fifty dollar camera, you can not see the LCD in bright sunlight. This makes the Canon an option if you think your going to use your camera outside the most. Canon is known for possible purple fringing on some of there pictures in high light. Be aware that I have seen this happen with this camera, although you can crop this out using your computer.. As far as image stabilization Canon believes you have to pay top dollar for it. You can compare Canons SD1000 to other brands in the same category and every other manufacture has Image Stabilization. This you may hear is not that important, but if you are in lower light like at parties or indoors that it can come in very handy. Ive seen a lot of blurry pictures come from this camera because of this. People have rebutted that if you adjust the shutter speed the Image Stabilization is not a problem this would be a correct statement but this is POINT AND SHOOT camera. Who wants to adjust the shutter speed? When you want to take a picture you aim and shoot otherwise get a SLR. Just remember the more ISO and the darker the light the more your picture will get grainy.. As far as the picture quality I find it nothing spectacular. Its not noticeable better than any other camera in this category. It does sometimes have a yellow hue, especially indoors. With computer editing you can correct this but again the user of this camera is probably wants to aim and shoot not screw around with settings.. The last thing I will mention is the battery door. In the past Canon has made this door out of hard plastic and it broke very frequently. They have wised up some and made it flexible so the door might fall off but it wont break (most the time).. In the end I would skip this camera and look at others in the same category unless the view finder is really important to you. Other manufactures give you more of a bang for your buck.. 

$$;
Pros:. yes, it is small and handy to carry around, easy to use if you just want point and shoot. 
Cons:. but, my camera has broken for the second time in the 2 1/2 months I have owned it.. 
Summary:. The power button has failed for the second time since purchasing the camera in June 2007. I sent it off for repair, and while the people on the phone are very nice, it really doesn't get you anywhere. One email from the tech people said that I would have my camera back in approximately 7 business days, another said approximately 10 days and when I called to check they said they were still waiting on a part. Obviously, those estimates don't mean a thing, and apparently, time at the repair center doesn't mean a thing because I have had my camera back just over a week and it is broken again. Don't know what I am going to do, but I am very disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Vivid color, clear pictures; nice product design. 
Cons:. Very fragile LCD screen; very poor Canon customer/repair service. 
Summary:. I bought this camera and it took great pictures, at least until I took it out of the case one day (only 2 weeks after I bought it!) to discover that the LCD screen had shattered internally.. I saw that other Canon camera reviews warned that the LCD was prone to breaking, but I figured the Canon brand was trustworthy enough to provide great customer support/repair if that were to happen.. I was wrong.. 25 days since Canon received my camera for repair and 2 customer service calls to check on the status of my camera repair: still no camera. The Canon rep I just spoke to on the phone said the camera parts should arrive within another 2 weeks (5 weeks after receipt of camera), and that cameras would be repaired in order of receipt. Then, she matter-of-factly stated that some cameras in the repair shop have been in there "for two to three months" and they still hadn't gotten to them, yet somehow her logic still compelled her to say that they would start repairing mine after the parts were received after 2 weeks. When I asked if there was anyone I could complain to, she sarcastically replied "I'm listening," before transferring me to her supervisor.. Her supervisor basically reiterated the company line, saying "parts are ordered overseas from Japan," "it takes some time for them to arrive from a foreign country," and that the repair confirmation e-mail and repair policy, which stipulates 7-10 business days for repair and return, does have the following caveat: "Actual times may vary. Seasonal volume or repairs requiring special parts may add more time," which is the catch-all for circumstances like this in which, as the supervisor put it, camera servicing may take "more than 30 days to order parts and complete the repair." He provided no possible remediation at all, just served as another complaint buffer, and offered to continue referring me to further supervisors, which presumably would have just reiterated the company's repair caveat: "Actual [repair] times may vary.". If you dare, buy the camera -- it was a great camera for 2 weeks until it broke -- but cross your fingers that it doesn't ever need to be repaired. Otherwise, you may experience the disappointment that compelled me to write this review.. 

$$;
Pros:. None overwhelming. 
Cons:. Constant "motion" alerts and blurry picutres. 
Summary:. I bought this camera as a point and shoot to carry in my pocket for pictures of the kids. After lenghty reading online, I somehow managed to miss that there was no image stabiliztion. I had pretty much assumed it was given at this price point. I am constantly getting "motion" warnings and my pictures are often blurry. Where are all those "spectacular" pictures everybody is talking about? What's the good of a point and shoot that you can't simply pull out of your pocket and take a picture? There were smaller, slimmer and cheaper cameras I could have purchased at the time. I would NOT buy this camera again.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it worked it was OK., I would pay more for a camera that isn't so cheeply made.. 
Cons:. Go check and see how many out there have the same lens error message. Da Ya think they plan it this way?. 
Summary:. I only wish quality would be the first priority with Canon. There service cost as much as I paid for the camera that was a "replacement "for the last one that failed through their "loyality plan". They just do not give a D#m.. 

$$;
Pros:. Decent features, good price. 
Cons:. Camera stopped working shortly after the warranty period ran out. It was never damaged or anything, it just stopped showing any image on the lcd screen, and any pictures taken are blank. Non-warranty repair from Canon costs as much as a new camera.. 
Summary:. Don't waste your money! Will not buy another Canon after this experience.. 

$$;
Pros:. I don't know, camera didn't work long enough. 
Cons:. Canon would not stand behind their product. 
Summary:. I purchased this camera and hardly used it, keeping in the closet for most of 3 months. When I took it out one day the lens cover was stuck in place. I examined the camera carefully for signs of damage (none noted) before packing carefully and sending it to Canon for warranty repair. Canon responded by claiming I damaged the camera and would not honor warranty. I strongly believe I was not treated in good faith by Canon. I will no longer purchase Canon products in the future.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size, light weight, large view screen. 
Cons:. Overall quality. 
Summary:. When I bought this camera, I searched all over the web for reviews and everybody seemed to love the SD1000. Unfortunately, most reviews are written about a brand new product, and most things work great when they're new.. I've had my camera for 13 months, and the image quality has been mostly good, though not great. Certainly good enough for e'mail and web use. The flash was a bit weak, but the face detection and auto focus seemed to work well. The video quality was actually pretty amazing, the compact size made it easy to carry this camera everywhere, and the large view screen was fantastic.. It WAS a good camera, until the warranty ended a month ago, at which point it seemed to simply self destruct as if an internal timer finally went off. My flash stopped working, and within a week the camera was totally dead. When I try to turn it on, the light by the on/off switch lights briefly, and I hear the camera click, but nothing else happens.. I've searched online for help and found numerous sites regarding lense errors, poor customer service, and generally low build quality. I guess I'm lucky I got a year out of it, which works out to about $17 a month. I expected better though, especially given the rave reviews. If you view this as a very nice disposable camera, you'll love it. If you want a quality piece, look elsewhere. I certainly will not buy another Canon.. 

$$;
Pros:. its small size. 
Cons:. its unreliable for those important pictures you only have one shot at. 
Summary:. Pictures of people came out blurry even with the face detection feature on, self timer didn't work properly, pictures came out dark using flash at short distance. I sent it to Canon Factory Service Center to be repaired as it was covered by the original warranty and it came back exactly as it was when I sent it even when it was "repaired" according to them.. 

$$;
Pros:. The quality of the pics taken outside are awesome! Options are nice and menu is pretty easy.. 
Cons:. Pics taken inside are fuzzy with tiny dots (like on a tv). Face recognition doesn't work that well.. 
Summary:. I bought this camera in December of 2007. I have had to send it back 2 times already!!! My Olympus Camedia C-740 3.2mp takes higher quality pics than this one and its 3-1/2 years newer. Save your money and time for another product or make sure you buy an extended warrantee. This one has definitely been a headache for me! Every time you send it to get fixed it takes a month to get back..
