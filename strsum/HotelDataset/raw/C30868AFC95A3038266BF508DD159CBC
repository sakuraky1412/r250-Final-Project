i have stayed in the beautiful city of basel several times , on business .
this was my first time for pleasure and with my husband , so i opted for the convenience of the location and the newness of the hotel victoria , on a friend 's recommendation .
the efficiency and swiftness of the check-in helped ease our jet-lag and a short nap got rid of it completely .
i chose a comfort room for the extra space for a slightly higher rate .
the beds and bedding are the most comfortable we have slept in in a long time and we are fussy sleepers !
we are even more fussy about the bathroom and there , we had no big complaints other than hoping for a bit more storage space for toiletries and a hand-rail to help climb out of the bath for those of us less agile .
we dined on swiss specialties at its restaurant and though the portions i found were slightly smaller than i found usual for switzerland , the meal itself was delicious .
impeccable service throughout .
continental breakfast was ok for the swiss price .
we took full advantage of the complimentary 2-day public transportation pass , which included the ride to the airport on the green # 50 euroairport bus , situated next to the train station .
the # 8 tram right outside the hotel was a fun way to sightsee on a cold afternoon and we even stayed on it for the 45 min .
loop . . . .
