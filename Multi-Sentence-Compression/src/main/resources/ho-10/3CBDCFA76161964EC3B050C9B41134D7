this time , i will not write the name of themanager on duty on the 2nd of may in the morning breakfast but ican say this , it is not nice to be aegoist and think that u can get away with it .
in all hotels , atleast to the ones , i have been in half the world , all hotels welcometheir guests to take pictures of their lovely buffet breakfast , their wonderful atmosphere but to my surprise , pictures were not allowed at the hilton in fumicino airport .
i could not find the socket , to plug in and the t.v was not working but miss giulia tried to help by calling the maintaince guy .
ofcourse , i suggest to the manager that i would like another table but he insist , that he wasfully booked and he needs that table for some coming guests .
i checked into my room , fullysatisfied until i try to make tea for myselfand switch on the telivision . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the receptionist miss giulia was very kind and immediatelygave me a nice room , while the bell boy justin did all he can to help me .
anyway , my day was ruined and i regret that u have tarnish the good name of the hiltons .
immediately , it came to my mind , what are they hiding that they do not want the world to see ? ? ? .
then , he started to move the little fridge and suddenly found a plug .
therefore , i had no choice but to seat on my given table .
