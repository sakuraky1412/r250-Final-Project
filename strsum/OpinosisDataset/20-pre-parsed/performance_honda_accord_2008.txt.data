no problem with quality, performance, etc .

t anywhere close to 3 series on many facets, namely performance, but sadly to say, in others, it surpasses .

performance is outstanding, more like a sports car than a coupe .

good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .

engine performance is very lacking .

it has room, performance, good mpg for its size and excellent reliability .

overall performance is good but comfort level is poor .

if you want sports sedan handling and performance, then pay much more and buy a true sports sedan !

the performance is incredible !

i'm impressed with the performance as well as efficiency gains .

features, quality, reliability, and performance, at a price no other car maker can touch .

it fits right , is fun to drive, great stereo, fuel economy, performance .

there seem to be so many components that enter into the vcm that performance can vary widely from car to car .

my my, i have never experienced such smooth performance, stability, pick, up, mileage and comfort that i am enjoying with my new 2008 honda accord .

the previous models were boring both aestically and performance wise .

honda has outdone itself on styling and performance .

still enjoy interior and exterior styling as well as overall performance and handling .

i researched many other makes and models but for the performance, quality, and style, the accord won hands down for cars under $32,000 .

after tracking almost 2 months of research on american and japanese mid, size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety ,  honda accord and toyota camry .

it does not diminish the performance of the car, it is just annoying .
