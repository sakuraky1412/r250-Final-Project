decision to buy a ps3 or xbox has been daunting a lot of people around the world  .

i guess a lot of reading and research led me to  .

buying the ps3 finally  .

and i strongly believe that i made the right choice  .

i would also agree that a lot of people will disagree with me and say otherwise  .

i don  .

t blame those people since it  .

s just a matter of choice in the end  .

so let me list down the features and rationalize my decision hoping it would help some aspirants out there now for my findings    .

in terms of she  .

view next photo | delete photoer graphics processing power , the multi core processing power of the ps3 take the cake over xbox any given day  .

i have played halo    3 , gears of war etc on the xbox and i found them very exciting however once i is playing games such as uncharted 2 , god of war etc on the ps3 , i realized what i is missing out on    bluray   hd content required a lot of space  .

bluray disc can hold upto 50 gb  .

why soo much space  .

to start with , 2010 will see games such as final fantasy xiii which will be need about 28    30 gb of space  .

so on an xbox , it would be offered on multiple dvds while on ps3 , it will be neatly available on once single bluray disc    the ps3 controller is a 6    axis motion sensing game pad  .

the ones on the xbox do not have motion sensing  .

games such little big planet on ps3 showcase motion sensing    i am using a sony bravia 32  .

full hd model so the ps3 just works it seamlessly  .

the tv remote can control basic functions of the ps3 when i am watching movies etc  .

also the bravia sync feature is a boon  .

switching off the ps3 will power down the tv and vice versa some points i noticed between ps3 xbox    .

internal hard disc   for a change sony did something really commercially viable  .

the hdd inside the ps3 is a standard 2  .

sata and you can easily swap it with a higher 500gb without voiding the warranty  .

the ps3 is offered in 120 250 gb models  .

i am using a 120 gb slim  .

xbox comes with a proprietary hdd casing which is way more expensive    controller   one of the smartest things i noticed is that the 6    axis controller comes with an inbuilt rechargeable battery pack  .

unlike the xbox which needs standard aa size batteries to power it up  .

and since the force feedback motors tend to consume a lot of power  .

the xbox controllers get drained soon  .

while the ps3 controller recharge using standard usb port and last a longer time    the power adaptor of the ps3 is in    built while the one on the xbox is a huge power brick which sits outside emitting heat conclusion    .

for me the choice is made  .

after reading tons of reviews and doing a lot of ground work , i put my money on the ps3 slim and so far i have been very happy with my decision  .

most of the games now a days are multi platform  .

same game available on both machines  .

i would say graphics wise i did not notice any difference between the ps3 and xbox  .

however i did feel somewhere that uncharted 2 had some fab graphics somewhat better than xbox  .

as a complete media center    ps3 completes my setup @ home  .

i have a logitech z2300 hooked up with my ps3 and it churns out some amazing sound effects  .

but then its ur preference ultimately  .

i cannot tell you to go for a ps3 just coz i like it  .

i would suggest you try playing on both for sometime and then make ur choice  .

i am an avid movie watcher    and i have my ps3 on wifi so i can stream videos , photos music off my laptop directly and seamlessly games like uncharted 2 , god of war 3 , little big planet etc look great on the ps3  .

i think the ps3 is more future proof when compared to the xbox ps3 is available in 2 models in india    .

ps3 slim 120 gb   19990/    (possible discount upto 1000rs)  .

ps3 slim 250 gb   22990/    (you can get a game free such as god of war 3)  .

features    .

the playstation 3 uses the sony , toshiba , ibm    designed cell microprocessor as its cpu , which is made up of one 3  .

2 ghz powerpc    based power processing element (ppe) and eight synergistic processing elements (spes)    graphics processing is handled by the nvidia rsx  .

reality synthesizer  .

, up to 1080p hd    256 mb of xdr dram main memory and 256 mb of gddr3 video memory for the rsx    bluetooth 2  .

0 , gigabit ethernet , usb 2  .

0 and hdmi 1  .

wi    fi networking    up to 7 controllers connected via bluetooth 2  .

media   bluray , dvd , cd , usb pen drive , portable hdd (fat32)  .

audio   hdmi (5  .

1 dolby) , fiber optic (7  .

1 dolby) , av (stereo)  .

video   hdmi upto 1080p full hd , av (standard hd)  .

i've always bought sony products for all my videos , starting from my betamax to my camcorders  .

and it is either a set    top sony blu    ray player or ps3  .

after some research , it is clear that ps3 is my choice  .

not only you get a superior blu    ray player with bluetooth remote (where i don't have to aim my remote) , you get a high    end console for slightly more than what you pay for the dedicated set    top system  .

between watching blu    ray movies and upconverted dvd , i get to play some cool games  .

my favorite is still the burnout paradise  .

it's graphics and physics are unvelievable yes , it cannon compete with xbox for sheer number of game availability , but my friends had to replace their xbox 360s several times  .

they're also noisy and gets hot unlike my ps3  .

the noise issue is very important when you're also using it for your home theater , and i do not have that problem with mine  .

ps3 is silent  .

i have mine hooked to 46 samsung hdtv and bose acoustimass surround system  .

i have no regrets with my purchase .

ps3 is the best console available hand down  .

people may have noted i didn't put price as a con  .

i think that when you have 20 gb more memory then the 360 , and free online play , built    in wi    fi and you don't have to pay for batteries  .

you really save money with the ps3  .

i really like the online play do not understand how xbox live is better  .

design is nice but is a fingerprint magnet  .

controller is nice , motion control is nice added feature but not even close to the wii  .

yes the game library is better on 360 , but there is a lot of exclusives for ps3  .

infamous , resistance 1 2 , littlebigplanet , and uncharted   drake's fortune  .

multi    media is great music , pictures , movies  .

but lets remember its a game console  .

i think its alot better then 360 .

this product is definitely worth the cost if you're a multimedia and gaming person , a gaming console and blu    ray player altogether .

i own both a ps3 and an xbox 360 and i find the ps3 to be a better console all around  .

first of all , the ps3 is a reliable console and the value of that cannot be underestimated  .

i have had my 360 die on me 3 times and i am tired of worrying about it giving out on me at any time  .

i just want to play games and not have to worry too much about the console dying       the ps3 gives me that peace of mind the ps3 also has the best selection of exclusives for my taste  .

games like uncharted , mgs4 , killzone 2 , little big planet , resistance 2 , heavenly sword , flower , warhawk and many others , are simply unrivaled in my opinion i also love the fact that the online service is free  .

psn gives me everything i really care about and the games run smooth and lag    free  .

it honestly makes me a little tired of paying for xbox live when both are providing essentially the same service it also happens to be a top    rated blu    ray player and bd movies look beautiful on my hdtv i honestly love almost everything about this console  .

the price is a little bit higher than the other consoles , but it is worth every penny .

dosent have the us type style (crad readers , usb e  .

it is a tough decision on whether to buy a xbox 360 or playstation 3 but after much research and reading reviews i decided to buy a ps3 and after buying the ps3 and playing both the wii and xbox 360 much since then i still believe i made the absolute best decision  .

very good graphics , loads blu    ray's fast  .

wifi is convinent , very nice design .

i recommend it for gaming and blu    ray movie watching at full high definition .

very happy with my purchase  .

did not get it as a gaming system even though i went to amazon and purchased 3 of last years top games for $19  .

99 each instead of the $55+ new games go for now .

i am an electronic sales and i highly recommend this console to anyone .

i am looking to buy a secondary bluray player , but after reading reviews on cnet and other websites , it seems like the only one that does it right , every time , is the ps3  .

apparently samsung has not solved bluray yet , every new iteration (1400 , 1500 , now 1600) is plagued with software issues  .

why is the ps3 still the only player (and yes , i realize that playing movies is not the intended primary function) to get it right  .

i've had mine for about 8 months and it has never spit out or refused to play any bluray (i've probably spun about 50 different blurays in it by now) or dvd (i have about 350    400 , and i've played old discs and new ones without experiencing anything)  .

it loads quickly , runs quiet , and produces an excellent picture  .

in short , it does what it's supposed to do .

ok , i'm not the type to say which game console is better that the other , but i like the ps3 because it does what most of the other game cosoles do , play games and it can play dvd's  .

i'm not much of playing games but the games have good graphics .

the overall best gaming console available , and , even when other consoles have the same specs , they are more then $70 overpriced then the ps3 .

its a system that has many great games like the metal gear series , and uncharted drakes fortune just to name 2  .

the number of online players and games is good  .

and the 80gb is larger then that of any current system  .

ps3 is a amazing multimedia product with everything included  .

the best blue    ray player in the market and high c/p value  .

it has lots of amazing games like killzone 2 , metal gear solid 4 , uncharted , little big planet and more  .

if you want to pay the least money and get all the features , go get a ps3  .

it just works  .

the games rock , and it has blu    ray  .

ps3 wii 360  .

fall in love with your ps3 , it'll never let you down .

the ps3 is the best gaming console i've ever played on .

it's the best console you can get  .

period .

if you want the best quality gaming experience , and to spend your money wisely in this hurtful economy , then go with the ps3 you'll be happy you did   )  .

buy the ps3  .

the ps3 is the most powerful system on the market , and by far the most reliable  .

its selection of games is superior to the xbox's , and far superior to the wii's  .

my sister got a wii for christmas , and i can tell you from experiance that after one month of wii sports , brawl , and some twighlight princess , you will beome incredibly bored with the system  .

i found that after a certain point i stopped having fin playing on it  .

the ps3 has never given me that feeling  .

it also is nice because i don't use it on a hd tv , but it still looks comparable to the 360 on and hd tv  .

it is considered one of , if not the , best blu    ray player on the market (according to cnet)  .

it has ps3 home which is really cool , and unlike the xbox's cheap avatars that look suspiciously similar to mii's  .

i have heard from gameinformer , and others that they are ashamed by their avatar because everyone looks like a complete loser , even if they are not  .

the ps3 is very quiet while i play , and i have played with a friend for 5 hours during a sleepover , and when we turned it off , it is as cool as when we turned it on  .

so , that is what i really had to say , i consider the ps3 the best system on the market .

great console love it  .

bottom line this   this by far the best system for hd movie viewing and , most importantly , gaming console you could possibly get in the world , thats right , in the world  .

hell , some of their exclusives are an excellent reason for even getting the console (metal gear solid 4 , little big planet , resistance 1 and 2 , god of war iii , final fantasy versus xiii , killzone 2 , gran turismo 5 , uncharted and heavy rain)  .

now , mgs4 is , no matter what people say , the best game ever made no , literally , ever  .

if anybody knows the true meaning of gran finale , this is it  .

fallout 3 doesn't deserve it , grand theft auto iv should also get game of the year , but it is unlucky enough to get caught up against mgs4 and therefore , loses  .

the only people who say that mgs4 doesn't deserve game of the year , clearly haven't played it , and if you have a ps3 you absolutely must have this game , trust me you won't regret it  .

anyways the only down    side to this console is the fact that it wo not play ps2 titles , which to me is a big mistake  .

give it 2 more years or maybe just one and you'll see the ps3 deserve to be in first place in the console race , just give it some time , and you'll see .

i put price as both a pro and con  .

why  .

$399 is alot of money , however , for a quality bluray player/media center/internet browser/game console that i can upgrade with relative ease , it is well worth the money  .

i've owned my system for about a year now and have been loving it since  .

even more now  .

make this your first bluray player .

this editor jeff bakalar is a liar r stuip for starters i have a ps3 and love it for all it can do he said that the ps3 is not backwards compatible at less with my ps2 games lol  .

and it does not have just 2 usb ports it has 4 all in front for a key bored , mouse , wired controllers , flash drive so u can upload anything u want no your ps3 , and it comes w/ a game moto storm to me that a bundle , and it has ports for your memory stick , sd memory card , compactflash card and full online from aol to utube google watch movies online just like a comp and have full susport like every 2months u get an update and to play online games and to go online is total free  .

so i call this editor jeff bakalar a liar r stuip next time u reight a review ues the product oh ya stop sucking on bill gates $  .

well , i have the 40gb one , the spidey version  .

while the cons i have seemed to apply to the new 80gb version they are still the cons of the 40gb version  .

i did upgrade my hdd to 320gb , which is great  .

i love the ps3 and the ability to upgrade the hdd and download hd movies , sd movies , games , trailers and all from the ps store , which has gotten a lot better  .

the game titles are getting better as well the no hd audio in bitstream is not subject to the ps3 alone , i think that most , if not all , blu ray dvd players do internal coding this is one of the best game consoles to have ever come come out , i am really excited to see what happens next .

i have owned a ps3 before (60gb model) and i love it very much  .

i like the cell broadband engine because it gives you a smarter a  .

i to play against  .

i also like the blu    ray format because of the media storage and the quality of the hue and picture  .

the games are great and there are good or great games in almost every genre  .

i can watch dvds in hd thanks to its support of hdmi and a firmware update  .

playstation network offers free online gaming with up sixty players , chatting with other users , and playstation home (as i said , i have tried the beta and it is great)  .

the graphics and physics are very appealing to me  .

the system has great reliability and excellent hardware  .

the system is quiet and it does not generate a lot of heat  .

i like how it has an internal power supply because we would not want to have a bulky external power supply  .

let us not forget the built    in wi    fi which reduces wires after wires  .

the 80 gb hard disk is great and it is interchangeable to any size there are several problems that this console has  .

it takes a lot of energy to power it and that leads to a higher power bill  .

playstation network has a long way to go before it can be at par with xbox live  .

frame rate for some games tend to have problems  .

two usb ports may not be enough for you if you have a lot of usb devices  .

no flash card reader means you will only have a usb storage device to save content i like this product because of the hardware , games , online service , reliability , and media it has to offer  .

if you like video games or other media or both , then this system is for you .

great machine  .

if your looking for a real hd gaming experience , the playstation 3 is the only one to cross into that market so far  .

best bang for your buck , and this is coming from a hardcore gamer .

although slow out of the gate the ps3 is definitely making ground over the competition and the best of all is that we are are still not seeing what the ps3 can really do  .

in my experience the console has been stable and fast something to consider if reliability is important to you  .

if your looking for a futureproofed hd console and your wallet will stretch then the ps3 is investment for you .

bioshock , mgs4 , oblivion , drakes fortune , all look great on the ps3  .

inmho , it is the best dvd/bluray player available  .

i'm an early adopter so a card reader and backwards compatibility with ps2 games are not an issue for me  .

60 gig has both as well as 4 controller ports  .

the hard drive can be upgraded easily by the consumer  .

great machine  .

im a games player of 23 yrs and never come across anything as good and dynamic as the ps3 , it covers all bases and will be making new 1s too updated  .

on oct 16 , 2008  .

i think its the best blu ray player for your money , best gaming console , good media machine  .

it's the only obvious choice for blue ray players  .

i have no idea how they sell stand alone units .

get a free ps3 and games  .

ive never had a problem with it  .

the fans keep the ps3 at below 90 degrees at all time  .

basically , this is the best console up to date  .

best power , graphics , and by far best variety in games  .

so if you are struggled between a ps3 and a 360 , make the decision with the ps3 , you cannot go wrong .

very good system , large hard drive , can playback from ipod just select the ipod when you connect it and push triagle and show all folders will come out and choose to open one songs are in folders can really play from any media source  .

here is why    .

backwords compatiblity  .

extra front panel slots  .

music/video/pictures storing/viewing  .

future proof  .

i love mine  .

this a must buy  .

i bought and 80 gig ps3 2007 christmas for myself and a month later gave my xbox360 to good will ive already upgraded it to 320gb hard drive and all my movies are on it my hd tv has never looked so good but the best thing is after a month of playing my xbox360 the red lights of death appeared and i waited 3 months to get to a new one back then had to buy a intercooler and my second xbox360 crashed all the time now my ps3 hasnt had a single problem and thats why i gave it a ten plus blu    ray is upgradeable to new profiles i have always liked sony products and they have never failed me also home  .

free online , great games , easy    to    use interface , remote    controller (no more getting situated then having to get up to turn it on  .

) , charging controller is fast , wireless internet available , upgradeable hard drive , hdmi compatible , plus more  .

this is one of my highlights for 2007  .

it is one of the best things that have come out in a long time  .

it is not only a really good console but a really good blu    ray player  .

if your not a gamer you should still get this considering the fact it is the cheapest blu    ray player out  .

also if you want to get it get this one or the 60 gb not the 40 or 20 because they either do not have bluetooth , ps@ playback or memory card slots  .

if you have the money get this  .

comparing to xbox 360 i would get the 360 because it is cheaper , better games , and optional hd dvd .

best one out of the rest of consoles out there .

ps3 is an amzing machine i never have a problem like i did with my previous xbox360  .

i received this as a christmas gift to replace my 1st gen xbox  .

i is very pleased with the graphics motor storm offered , even with my non    hd tv  .

i never had xbox live , because i thought it is a waste of money however , the ps3's online marketplace is pretty nifty  .

you are able to download demos (and still keep playing you're game while you are downloading) , as well as obtain videos  .

obviously , motor storm is the first game i played  .

the loading times are slow , and online is so    so , but a few days later i bought resistance   fall of man , which has awesome online capabilities , as well as speedy loading and super    high multiplayer frame rate  .

there is so many good games out and coming out for the ps3 & warhawk , timeshift , orange box , burnout   paradise , i wish i could buy all of them right now , but they cost 60 bucks each , so ill have to wait  .

this system has impressed me a lot , and i cant wait to see what the future holds for the playstation 3 system  .

this machine is the one to have  .

it beats its competition by a mile  .

included blu    ray and dvd upconverting puts stand    alone dvd players to shame  .

gaming capability and graphics look amazing , what more could you possibly want  .

this is a must have for any person who enjoys video games  .

the graphics look outstanding especially on a hdtv  .

the wireless controller work excellent  .

the battery will last for a very long time without needing recharged  .

does not need a memory card which is real nice  .

i have all my songs , videos and pictures on it from my ipod  .

you are able to use a photo as your wallpaper which is a cool feature  .

i see some complain about no usb port in the back but why do you need one in the back when you have 4 in the front  .

it is wireless ready which is more than xbox can say and it works good too  .

the only issue that i found is that when you go onto the playstation portal page to play demo's and download games it does not work  .

sony says they are working on that  .

i have played friends and other people online in motorstorm , ncaa 08 football , and fightnight and the online play is great  .

i do not see any issues with it  .

if your a clean freak you will be dusting this almost everyday but thats really the only downfall of this system  .

that and they need more games to come out but they are getting that going  .

once again a must have .

this machine is incredible  .

i recommend getting the logitech keyboard (bluetooh or usb) to take advantage of the browser  .

ps3 eye also has incredible features as low res camera and good film/picture editing software  .

eye also has amazing game called eye of judgment  .

free gaming online  .

i consider myself a responsible adult (35+) but i can see myself getting hooked on this thing  .

i recommend the 80gb b/c the downloads are coming fast and furious  .

i also recommend that it become your media center , plenty of room for music and movies  .

sony got it right for once  .

to start this off , let me preface this review by stating that i had owned an xbox 360 since early 2007 , and it is now august 2009  .

i loved my 360 , it is a great machine , but in comparison to my new ps3 , it leaves some to be desired my 360 rrod once , and it had to be sent in for a 2 week repair at the cost of 100$ to me  .

the new ps3 does not get anywhere near as hot as my 360 did , and i feel very good about its construction  .

the controller is very similar to what xbox offers , but comes standard with an internal rechargeable battery  .

hdmi output allows true 1080p hd , and ps3 actually has games coming out native in 1080p such as gow3 , while xbox only upconverts to 1080p  .

interface is not as good as 360 , but does the job , and the psn , although not yet up to live , is very good for a free service overall , i prefer my ps3 do to its construction , exclusive titles , free wifi and blu ray , which really does look amazing  .

its just more bang for your buck imo at 299 .

good system but needs some corrections  .

i do not like the fact that you cannot have your friends over to play on one system they have to be at seperate places or bring their systems over for the majority of the games updated  .

on aug 18 , 2009  .

the ps3 is the most powerful gaming console out there and it comes with better graphics or reliability then the wii or the xbox 360  .

even with the above cons , the playstation 3 is an amazing piece of art  .

this little fella can do almost every multimedia function on earth , and it brings a blu    ray player along for the ride  .

the exclusive titles are amazing (god of war , killzone , reistance , metal gear solid , infamous , socom , littlebigplanet , uncharted , motorstorm , heavenly sword , and many more)  .

the games are flat out awesome  .

along with these great games comes the best graphics ever seen on a game console  .

the ps3 has built    in hdmi capabilities for full hd gaming  .

the games look so clear and crisp on this system , no joke  .

you can use any bluetooth headset as a microphone/earpiece for online chat , but it is pretty lousy i mean , it works , but there is always static and the voice is muffled  .

the only major flaw with the ps3 is that since sony doesn't charge for online service , they do not pu much funding into it it is unorganized , slow , and downright buggy  .

it is functional , nothing is broken , but it just is not as premier as xbox live (like i said previously , you get what you pay for , xbox live is $50 a year , but it is extremely well    made)  .

anywyas , that's all i got to say about the playstation 3  .

i recommend this system to anyone about 12 up  .

there are some decent family games , but it is more for the teen    adult audience  .

honestly , if you're wondering if you should get an xbox 360 or a ps3 , i say just go with your gut feeling , because they are both amazing consoles  .

check out my review of the xbox 360  .

the ps3 is the best console on the market  .

the ps3 is the best in both gaming and multimedia  .

it has a superior network  .

unlike the 360 and wii , there's no need to pay for additional services , making it the cheaper console than the 360  .

unfortunately , ps2 bc , 2 usb ports , and flash card readers were removed .

i am a big gamer playing mostly shooters  .

i do a lot of research before purchasing and i can say that the ps3 is worth every penny  .

it is such a great system ; great blu    ray player and gaming platform  .

this system is a steal if you are looking for a blu    ray player  .

i bought one game for this and it is killzone 2  .

wow  .

what an amazing game  .

it has such great graphics , and online play  .

by far my favorite game i have ever played  .

the ps3 is a great machine and would highly recommend it  .

i got the ps3 as a birthday gift from my dad  .

i 've had my ps3 for four months and it has been running smoothly  .

my friend who hates the ps3 says that it gets so hot you can cook saussages on it  .

i play ratchet clank future   tools of destruction for up to five hours and the outside does get warm , but not hot  .

sometimes it even feels cold  .

the only problem i've had so far is getting the pink panther bd to play after i updated my firmware to v  .

but i got it to play  .

i don't really need the media card readers because i already have a ps2  .

ps   don t hook the ps2 up to an hdtv , it s ment be played on a crt tv  .

anyways i think the ps3 makes a great birthday gift because it supports 1080p unlike the wii and dose not get the red ring of death like the xbox 360  .

the first night out of the box is very disappointing  .

i could not play without first doing an update to both the system and my game (gta iv)  .

the worst part is that sony for some reason is unable to make the system download the update in the bcakground       you cannot do anything while downloading an update  .

is not this one of the most powerful processors on the planet  .

for those that are crying over 2 usb ports , add a $5 hub  .

an hdmi cable would have been nice , you you can find those realativley cheap if you shop around otherwise i have had a very nice experience with this system  .

since little big planet came out , my daughter and i have been on it constantly  .

i have no real complaints , unlike some of the xbox fanboys thet have logged in  .

every system is what you make of it .

ok , early adopter , i have had this product for almost 2 years now , i originally had the 60gb version but then expanded my hard drive space and now have 250gb  .

very easy to do , but anyways , the ps3  .

depending on what reason you purchase this system , it will deliver  .

the games are spectacular , when created correctly by developers blu    ray movies are crisp , and simply using this as a game console , you will not be disappointed  .

the price tag may turn people away , but once you do purchase it you will see why you definately get what you pay for .

i have been an occasional pc / mac gamer in the past , so not having ps2 backward compatibility is not a big deal  .

i bought the ps3 to play blu    ray movies , primarily       and play a few games  .

i is surprised and impressed with the ability to download movies directly from the ps3  .

very happy with this purchase .

awesome system  .

perfect for people who need something to store/listen/watch all their videos , songs , pictures , and games  .

internet browser is good  .

let's face it , this is the best console out of the bunch  .

the wii has terrible 480p graphics that look like an old playstation 2 or gamecube from the early 2000 years  .

the whole motion sensing controls is a gimmick  .

only 3 or 4 nintendo made games use the motion sensing well , but every single other game use it horribly and this is why it's a gimmick  .

the xbox 360 is not reliable , it will break down and you will have to send it to microsoft to have it repaired and you have to take extended waranties  .

not to mention if you love movies , well hd    dvd is dead , so that's out of the question  .

no blu    ray adapter for the xbox 360 makes it feel worthless  .

i own a dell xps gaming pc and a wii i wanted a new console , and i chose the ps3 because of what it can do over any other console out there even over my pc  .

there's games you can only find on consoles because game developers are afraid of game piracy  .

so they release games exclusive to xbox 360 and ps3 only  .

because of stuff like that , owning a gaming pc is not enough  .

unless you don't mind missing out on great titles like soul calibur 4 , halo 3 , metal gear solid 4 , rachet and clank , uncharted , grand theft auto 4 and others then fine do not buy a console  .

but if you do love those kinda games , and you cannot get'em on the pc , then there's only 1 solution buy a console  .

the playstation 3 is pricy and it is the only thing that kept me from ever buying one  .

but seeing as the xbox 360 has so many hardware flaws (dead hd    dvd format and red ring of death) unless the xbox 360 drops to $199  .

99 or less , it's not worth buying ever  .

why buy a disposable console when you can pay double the price for a console you could probably keep forever  .

i own a playstation 1 and playstation 2 and they both still work fine  .

my ps2 is dying a little because i overplayed it , but it still runs  .

i own an original xbox and it's dead  .

after owning it for 4 years , it died on it's 4th year 1 year after it's waranty expired , and now i have a paper weight black box that does nothing  .

it sucks  .

when i heard the xbox 360 has red ring of death issues , i is ready to avoid microsoft hardware from now on  .

if you're thinking of buying a wii , playstation 3 or xbox 360 here's what i say    .

if you want a pure gaming system , buy a wii  .

there's a good dozen great titles on the wii , making this console worth buying for games alone  .

if you want a media system , for movies and games , buy a playstation 3  .

it's pricy , but it's a worthy investment  .

if you want a cheap 2    3 year pure console game , buy a xbox 360  .

if you think you will not touch your xbox 360 in 3 to 4 years from now , then buy this disposable console  .

i currently just bought the mgs4 package bundle , whatever mgs4 is already a current contender in the game of the year and is a strong contender to win  .

now whats better than getting a free game thats supposed to be and is in my oppinion the best game made so far for ps3  .

i love the system and crystal clear graphics  .

i also decided to buy the game systyem for the games soon to come out killzone 2 heard great things resistance 2 and fallout 3 not to mention the already out mlb 08 which has the most realistic gmaeplay ever made these are just a couple of the new exciting things happening that led me to buy the ps3 not to mention that the ps3 online center is improving ( but the xbox is to far ahead especially with microsoft)  .

all in all its the uprising game system that is the future of gaming due to the cell broadband processor  .

its gona be a good competition this holiday to see who sells more the xbox or ps3 the wii isnt for serious gamers its a family system .

overall  .

the ps3 is great  .

only flaw with this sytem is that it is not compatible with universal remotes  .

sony needs to step up regarding this  .

the ps3 has earned its place among high    end components in the home teater world  .

to seal its place , it needs to be subject to the control of universal remotes like every other component  .

another option is for the makers of these remotes to make one that runs on both ir technology (old but universal) and bluetooth (new and upcoming) right now i guess i'll stick to juggling three remotes , cos it does not make sense to drop $200 for a remote that is not thruly universal .

i have the 80gb mgs bundle and i love it  .

its quiet , even when playing games , fast , has free online , but not as sophisticated as xbox live , and has an integrated blu    ray profile 2  .

0 player , which are pretty expencive as standalones  .

a couple things i can complain about  .

backwards compatibility has glitches occasionally since its software emulation but , sony gives you a site to check compatibility first  .

there are no ps2 ports on it meaning you need adapters  .

in my opinion , the perfect ps3 system would have atleast 1 legacy memory card port and atleast 1 legacy controller port to be able to use your classic controllers and transfer over your old gamesaves without having to buy a hard to find $15 adapter which you'll only use once i also have to complain that the system on a d    link wbr    2310 router comes up with random you have been signed out of the playstation network errors (router is basically 20 feet away from the system , 80% signal) i think this is just the router but the wireless card in the ps3 could also play a part  .

i have tried 2 of the same routers and have a couple friends with the same router one advantage is that you can use older pc game controllers on it  .

while not all may work , its still nice to be able to use them overall i think that the system is a great one for gaming and multemedia  .

you should get this if    .

online play is not top priority (free psn vs  .

pay xbl)  .

you like platformer games (ps3 has many of those)  .

you want a blu    ray 2  .

0 player (currently one of the cheapest)  .

you do not care about b/c (though the 360 is worse)  .

you want a computer (can run linux)  .

one last thing , i call this a pro but could be a con  .

it is pretty hard to find  .

its a pro to me because it means it's selling well .

seriously a guy i worked with did this and got a ps3 (which also has a blue    ray disc player in it)  .

so , i went ahead and signed up  .

all you need to do is take about 5    10 minutes  .

i selected the stamps  .

com free 4 week offer  .

you do need to give your credit card number but only need to keep your account active for 21 days (3 weeks)  .

therefore , my buddy at work cancelled his around the 23rd day and there were no charges (in fact , they do give you $5 free worth of stamps to print if you want)  .

he actually got 13 other friends to do it and received the 80 gb ps3 with extra controller and one game (you can get just the 80 gb ps3 for 8 referrals) shipping is free too  .

they also have $375 or $425 cash you can receive instead of the ps3 (although i'm not sure on this as my buddy only confirmed the ps3) get one for free  .

it does play blu    ray , some ps2 games , also ps1 games small lineup of ps3 games , nice reset feature (press and hold power for 5 seconds)  .

and everything i mentioned above i is there to buy a console and i told myself when i play games in 2009 what console would be capable of paying games with the best graphics , some neat innovations (six    axis) , maybe even watch movies  .

the ps3 is the only console that can watch blu    ray movies , has true 1080p capabilities (but have not seen any game use it)  .

i is thinking an x    box 360 for halo 3 but then i thought of my friend that went through 4 of them within about 6 months and he is not a hardcore gamer like me so i said that is immediately out of the picture  .

the wii is well good and all with the wii remote , but game selection is missing something other than like mario , donkey kong etc then i thought well the wii uses 480p i believe which is last gen  .

also graphics does look as good as my psp  .

but does not even come close to ps3 final verdict buy a ps3 , anyways i am an rpg gamer and cannot wait for ff13 , and kingdom hearts 3 .

i reaesrched both x    box 360 and ps3 and it came down to best bang for the buck  .

it cost me $569 to get a ps3 w/ 2 controller , game and 5 bd movies with the x    box , $499 for system w/ 1 controller  .

i would have had to buy a wireless card to connect via wifi $99 , hd    dvd player is $200 (which i found to be inferior) , a second controller would be $50 and a game would have been $60 , on line play is pay to play $50 a year  .

and x    box is having lots of problems , external powersupply , etc (i just did not like it)  .

so in the end it would have cost me over $1000 to get what i got w/ a ps3 and had to pay to play on    line and prey it did not break so i bought a ps3 instead and find in more amazing every time i play it thanks sony  .

ps3 is a great system great line up of games are coming ps3s future is bright like the sun , new advanced technology is in there and it will win like its younger brothers (ps1 , ps2) so in other words buy  .

the ability to take this 80gb unit and change out the hard drive for a 120gb , 200gb or 350gb makes it hard to beat  .

i store movies and music currently and know i will be able to use it for much more  .

the bluray dvd drive is great and makes it worth the purchase alone  .

i dont play many games on the ps3 but my son does and loves it awesome product  .

i originally got the ps3 to play blu ray movies , after getting the system , i realized how nice it is for all my media , it's nice to watch and see all my files from my computer through my ps3 to my hdtv  .

look , it's really quite simple  .

there are those that are content with average and ok  .

and so they created the xbox 360 just for you  .

now on the other hand there are those of us who prefer the finer things in life and so they built this shiny black machine with so much under the hood that the gaming companies are still trying to catch up to it  .

that is just fine with me because when they do figure it out microsoft will be back at the drawing board  .

the xbox 180 might be a nice badge  .

let's also not forget that blu    ray has won the war and that will only make this purchase that much more of a no brainer .

this thing is great but i feel as if it should have been released as a computer or an entertainment hub or even a ps4 it's just to advanced it takes alot of power to replace my hp , and it did it is better than most pc's out their and i have mine working on the linux yellow dog platform made exclusively for the ps3  .

i even have programs such as lime wire , a windows emulator and even a word processor of which i have used already to turn in an assignment  .

now i also own a wii which has a more advanced web browser and better games but does not come close to the ps3's power  .

the ps3 even has the ability to burn cd's , rip off of memory cards in its media bay and than even import videos photos and music to another memory stick curaintly i am using orb on my pc and it can even stream from that automatically which is kind of creepy if you don't know about that when you first sign into your wifi network it kind of just hacks your computer without me pressing a button it had my pics music and videos ready to view which i must say is slightly dangerous i would have given it a ten if it didn't have all of these computer like features i gave it a 9 cause it tries to hard it does everything except cook and tuck you in at night  .

it is just not the awesome game system my brawling wii and bioshock360 are now i do not want to say that its terrible but it is good because of its graphics but without the graphics it is just another game system which it kind of is not  .

if your looking for innovation get a freaking wii along with galaxy and brawl if your looking for shooters with good graphics look for 360 if your looking for an entertainment hub that is sure to replace almost every thing but your surround sound system and hdtv get a ps3 it's pros are it's cons it is too advanced to be a game system and the fact that you can connect a keyboard , mouse , printer , internal and external hard drive , linux yellow dog , windows emulators , blue tooth technology and the promise of keeping up to date via firmware upgrades aka service packs  .

the ps3 should have been sold as a mac and pc killer not a game system p  .

s if you plan to use it as your new pc here are some tips on what you might need a hard drive is not really needed if you have the 80gig ps3 logitech bluetooth media board $80  .

(this thing is in all in one mouse and keyboard it's wireless so it's great for travel and having a laptop pad mouse in place of the number pad usually found on normal keyboards is genius and works excellent)  .

120gig hard drive $100  .

(this is very optional if you have an 80gig ps3 but once you connect to psn and start downloading videos photos and music online you are going to start taking up all that space)  .

sony bluray dvd remote $25  .

(only sony brand and because of the controllers odd control of video playback this is super useful)  .

play station eye $70  .

(if you are a mac user this will serve as your new photo booth with much more advanced features way better quality than the mac photbooth and even makes games more intuitive while it is not a wii it is pretty cool and the camera effects will keep you entertained for a bit)  .

bluetooth headset  .

(super optional at this point because at the moment only a handful of games use headsets to communicate but as of later this year a little known thing called home is coming out were it is exactly like real life in the way of communication although you can use voice emotes and a keyboard you can use your headset to speak also  .

and last but definetly not least it's the cheapest most monitor like 1080p screen you will ever lay your eyes on it's gotten wonderful reviews and almost no major complaints  .

the scepter x20wg    1080p black 20  .

1 $190  .

(this thing is awesome it has better quality than alot of tv's i have seen it is low priced and not only does it look like a monitor but it is one with the functionality of being used as a normal computer monitor also and man when i tell you windows in 1080p it is impossible not to have a geekgasm their have been some complaints of led bleeding when the screen is all black like in a movie transition or blackout but i have not seen anything as of now another con is the monitor is only available from newegg  .

com and takes 3 days to arrive but it is worth the wait)  .

i hope this review is helpful in your purchase innovation and fun   wii  .

shooters good graphics  360  .

media hub and pc replacement  .

nuff' said .

never been much of a gamer  .

my last system is a sega genesis 16 that is bought to play ea's nhl games what drove me to this purchase  .

my wife  .

she got hooked on guitar hero at a party  .

now , i know that guitar hero is available on cheaper systems , but i didn't want to invest in yesterday's technology  .

still , it took some research before i finally settled on the ps3  .

i'm glad that i did out of the box , the system is fairly easy to setup  .

what puzzled me though is the lack of connectors for hd  .

whether you want to connect using hdmi or component cables , you are going to have to purchase these separately  .

the component cables will be proprietary for the ps3 while the hdmi cable it uses is standard  .

everything about this console is high    end graphics and blu    ray , yet the supplied connectors won't get you any better than 480p  .

hdmi cables aren't expensive  .

contrary to what sales people at big    box stores will tell you , a $5 hdmi cable will perform just as well as a $100 one  .

the problem is that you'll have to go online to find the $5 cable once i got my system connected properly , setting it up is fairly straight forward  .

we purchased the 80gb model because we felt that it is worth $100 to get twice the disk space , wifi , the card readers , and compatibility with most ps2 games  .

the wifi is as easy to get connected as any laptop  .

once connected , the system downloaded an update , and within a few moments we were in business the system came with motorstorm (an off    road racing game) and it blew me away  .

it's amazing the power you get for $500  .

a $500 pc would never be able to run a game like this  .

i cannot wait to check out other titles from what i've seen , an xbox 360 has similar games that look equally as stunning  .

so , why get the ps3  .

the blu    ray player is what got me  .

i've been waiting for the hd video disk format war to end before investing in a player  .

now my investment is somewhat protected because if blu    ray loses the format war , i still have a terrific game console  .

if you own an hd television and have been limited to the hd experience via cable and satellite , you need to take a look at a blu    ray demo  .

it's night and day better than the compressed hd you'll get from broadcasters  .

and the blu    ray player can upconvert your standard dvd's to make them look pretty close to hd  .

i've seen other upconverting dvd players , and they do not perform as well as this one  .

you'll need to shell out $25 for a remote for playing blu    ray movies  .

there is no infrared port on the unit , so the remote must be bluetooth  .

you can use the sixaxis controller , but you'll tire of it's limitations quickly another cool thing is the media reader  .

we had the family over for christmas  .

everyone is taking pictures with their digital cameras  .

we used the ps3 to view pictures as a group  .

i saved the good ones that i wanted to have right to my ps3's hard drive i cannot tell you that a ps3 is superior to an xbox or a wii  .

there are too many variables  .

as a full featured entertainment system , the ps3 gets the nod in my book .

i mean what's not to love about the ps3 , hd gaming , blueray player (1080p) by the way , 80gig hd , web browsing , psp like op system i mean you do not only play hd games , you could watch hd movies (blueray) at the full 1080p and store your files in the 80gig hd for later browsing , go online , play old ps2 games the only thing is still very expensive for a lot of people , i got mine at walmart for 500 with 10 blueray movies and a free game , that's why i have to say what not to love .

anyone interested in getting a ps3 for free , all you have  .

to do is refer 8 people to this site  .

ref  4437837  .

i have really great friends ; one of them gave me this console on the day after thanksgiving  .

not even christmas , mind you , but black friday  .

just gave me one wow the first thing i noticed upon unboxing it is familiar desktop and laptop computer parts ; the sixaxis controller had not some weird sony proprietary parts , but an ordinary usb cord , with a standard small end and big end  .

my research beforehand also showed that even the hard drive is a standard laptop sata drive ; if i wanted to , i could swap it out for a 250 gig western digital drive , just like the one i put in the laptop i'm using to write this review  .

sony did a complete 180 degree on this , as their historic use of proprietary parts instead of interchangable components is legendary  .

(the ps3's sibling psp's reliance on umd and memory stick instead of regular sd cards , as well as limited support for common video formats , is a deal breaker  .

) i'm really glad to see sony changing its ways here  .

the usb ports have great plug    and    play capabilities , too ; i plugged in a standard usb keyboard and without any additional buttons to push could type entries on registration forms and name blanks my console came with the game motorstorm , which is a fun racing game , but i got a better taste of the true capabilities of this console when my already nice friend also threw in ratchet and clank future   tools of destruction  .

playing the first level showed off both the rendering capabilities of the cell processor itself and some of the fun gadgetry capabilities of the console , such as the motion    sensing controller  .

i know , it's not the same as the wii's tennis and bowling prowess , but it's still cool to control a character through motion wirelessly with a handheld controller the menu    driven interface is convenient and simple , making this device , as powerful as it is , accessible to novices as well as experts  .

however , the former might have a hard time getting used to playstation controller conventions  .

since i'm not myself a heavy gamer , aside from the visual shock of going into a seventh generation console , i did have to get used to using a game controller to navigate system settings such as wireless networking or to browse an online store but , even people who never play a video game may want this console for its remarkable media capabilities  .

aside from being one of the cheaper and yet one of the better blu    ray consoles , a firmware update recently also made it one of the best 1080p upscaling dvd players  .

coupled with a user    replacable hard drive and usb expansion ports , one could use it as a digital media hub  .

(granted , the remote control is sold seperately and is bluetooth    based , meaning adapting a universal remote means going with third party infrared work    arounds)  .

user replacability of the hard drive aside , i still recommend this console over the 40 gig for media purposes because of both the extra two usb ports and the memory card readers       both memory stick and sd , and even cf are included  .

(for gamers , i would absolutely insist on this in lieu of the 40 gig model because of the lack of ps2 reverse compatability in the latter  .

my wanting to play okami is a reason for rejecting the 40 gig spidy 3 version in my research even before my friend got wind of my interest in this console  .

another selling point for the playstation 3 is that its hardware is durable and sturdy  .

early models of the xbox 360 are having enough problems with permanant failure that they have their own special name for it  .

(not a good thing for microsoft , which is still recovering from a reputation created by the legacy of windows 98  .

) the internal power rather than an extra transformer brick is nice  .

that said , one should note that the console tends to warm up the room pretty quickly when it's on  .

the high end inards also tend to need more wattage , making this the most power    hungry of the new gaming consoles , or for that matter any gaming console short of a falcon northwest mach v with rediculously unneccessary extra geforce 8850 graphics cards stuffed in for bragging rights  .

but , you have the console itself to remind you to plant a tree to offset its carbon footprint , by raising the temperature of your own environment a few degrees all in all , its a superb piece of hardware  .

it's a killer game console that , while lacking very many of its own titles , can play a lot of ps2 titles (if you make sure to get the right one ; for you die    hards , you might want to backtrack and look for the 60 gig model that achieves ps2 backwards compatibility by having rather than hardware emulation a tiny , shrunken down little ps2 physically stuffed inside) until the gaming industry catches up  .

it doubles as a blu    ray player , and its cell processor's multithreaded nature makes it one of the best 1080p dvd upscaling systems out there  .

it triples as a hard drive media player that , with minimal work and a trip to best buy , could hold over 200 gigs worth of mp3s , videos , and pictures  .

and , appearantly soon it will quadruple as an online social networking tool that , unlike the xbox 360 , does not require a monthly fee  .

(i'll have to see whether or not that works out  .

) if you're building a bleeding edge home theater system , it's almost a must       if you're going to spend $500 on a blu    ray player , why not get the one that also has a built    in hard drive and just happens to play games like there's no tomorrow  .

just got this unit havent hooked it up to the internet or a network yet , but setup is very user friendly controllers are alot lighter the ps/ps2 controllers  .

the included usb cable for the controller is very short , so if the battery dies , playing wired kinda sucks , but its not often that that will happen the synaxis feature is really awesome , and makes up for the loss of the vibration sensor in the controllers on the other hand , it only works for some games (ie   racing games) however , most games it doesnt work with , you probably wouldnt want it on anyways (ie   first person shooter games)  .

on the down side of things , it is a very large heavy console , but because it looks pretty sweet , you dont mind having it sticking out in the middle of your entertainment system  .

first time i hooked it up , it is to an older crt 27 tv even on that it is sweet its now permanently hooked up to my sony 46 which is much better , but still need to get the hdmi cable for even better quality  .

another (slight) down side is that it wont (at least not that i've found as of yet) take older ps/ps2 memory cards cool side to that is that if you use ps/ps2 games , it will create a virtual memory card on the hard drive for saving data also , you can use smaller (ie   compact flash/ secure digital) memory cards over all , its a pretty sweet system  .

i'd reccomend it for sure  .

i have already received 60 gig ipod by doing this , and now i want to get my ps3 before christmas  .

you can too free and easy .

with the inclusion of a blu ray player , free online service and ever expanding list of features , the ps3 is hands down the best console  .

exclusive titles are still cacthing up to the 360 , but given that the system has only been out for 1 year , i am willing to wait  .

playstation home is also coming out soon which will revolutionize the online gaming experience  .

and best of all , it's free  .

once game developers harness the power of the ps3 , it will blow away the competition .

the only thing preventing me from giving this a perfect 10 is the lack of games and functionality that's oh    so    close  .

i tried and loved the xbox 360 , but for the $$$ you have to go with the ps3  .

i love the blu    ray disks and the games that are out look spectacular updates are timely and the online content will only get better  .

i could envision downloadable movies in the near future  .

great experience so far .

i'm pretty sure people have thought the new slim playstaion 3 is better and more stylish well you guys thought right  .

prior to its new look , its menu options have varied since the old playstation 3  .

its quite ironic that everyone is falling head    over    heels for the old playstation systems  .

i'm not going to exaggerate the truth  .

i trust sony and i'm pretty sure they'll come out with better ones  .

but don't hold your breath  .

it won't be here for a while  .

its a good system overall and it is something worth bragging about  .

but its memory space is not as large as the previous playstation 3 so that part will be marked as a con  .

its definitely cheaper so those who could not enjoy some ogf its features such as blu    ray and internet can do all that now  .

and technically , we should thank sony for this because its virtually more than just one component  .

its features , such as blu    ray , internet , music player , chat , gameplay , e  .

c can individually be gotten from many stores , and will cost you over $1000  .

and you guys get it just for $299  .

most parents tell their kids that they have it better from their chuildhood , but it is the parents with this system in fact , that have it great  .

and entirely , if ii gave this system a grade , it would be an (a    )  .

a ps3 is an expensive video gaming console that has many pros and cons  .

before someone could even think of buying it they should know its capabilities  .

this information will help you decide if you would be interested in a ps3 or if xbox 360 would be a better choice for you a ps3 has a lot of good features to it  .

a ps3 can read dvds that don  .

t seem to work on old dvd players  .

it can play games for hours on end , without burning the ring into the disk , an issue that the xbox 360 has  .

there is only a fee for the internet itself , no add    ons for playing on the ps3 the ps3 also has its issues  .

the internet lags unless you have really fast internet  .

only the older ones have backwards compatibility , and remotes for the old ones are scarce  .

the games cost more .

this is a great gaming console/blu    ray player  .

however they're 5 things missing on it that the original ps3 had 1  .

it is no longer backwards compatible (still plays ps1 games)  .

there's no flash card readers  .

there's no sacd support (which you really don't need)  .

there' only 2 usb ports  .

there's no chrome accents  .

don't get me wrong the new ps3s are amazing and i would recommend them in a heart beat  .

i'm just saying that if you need the features listed above it's not the best configuration for you  .

however if the missing features are not a big deal to you go out and buy it , there are a ton of game , the graphics are awesome , and in my opinion it's better than the xbox 360 .

if you're a electronic wizard , the ps3 is right up your ally , hands down  .

if you are a gaming lord , they ps3 doesn't totally dissapoint , but would serve better rank with more kick    butt exclusive games  .

i would also like to see an improvement on the gaming graphics in upcoming titles  .

eventhough , the technology is still fairly new and has not been completely master , i would defianately like to see some great improvements on game quality , and when those issues somewhat resolve , 360 will start to submerge .

ps3 has everything over xbox360 , in my opinion looks are a big deal to me , so ps3 has it hands down however , i feel that ps3 also has greater potential for growth with it's bluray disk format (larger disk space for game developers to work with) and custom designed graphics processor  .

if i'm going to blow $300 on a console , might as well go with one that wo not be old in the future , and the xbox360 is going to get old faster than the ps3 .

so , why did sony discontinue the ps3 console that played both ps1 and ps2 games  .

seriously    i cannot even buy a new ps3 that will play any of the old games  .

for 400 or 500 bucks , why only one controller  .

how about including at least 2  .

blu    ray player , but you have to purchase a remote control because universal remotes will not control this console  .

seriously , you need to spend another $100 just to walk out the door without a single game  .

the real cost is 500    600 bucks , and having to purchase all new games .

just a few things i wanted to point out about the cnet review of the ps3 , just some technical details that were incorrect particularly the cell inside section the 360 uses more off    the    shelf pc components , while the playstation 3's 3  .

2ghz cell processor is built from the ground up just for the console  .

incorrect here , the 360's processor is also built from the ground up by ibm , as is the ps3's as with the graphics chip , the ps3's blu    ray drive       which allows for games of 25gb to 50gb in size       has yet to show a big advantage over the 8  .

5gb limit of the xbox 360's dvd media  .

i assume they meant cell processor instead of graphics chip here , as the two consoles graphics chips are nearly even , with the 360 having a slight advantage due to unified shaders  .

so since their nearly even , how would the ps3's graphics chip be an advantage  .

it consists of a single powerpc    based core with seven synergistic processing units and is the result of a joint effort between ibm , sony , and toshiba , which is ironic , considering that sony and toshiba were in a deathmatch over blu    ray and hd dvd  .

not a big deal but they probably should have mentioned that only 6 of those spu's are available to developers , as one is reserved for the os at all times another thing is that the ps3's gpu has only half the memory bandwidth of a geforce 7800 which it is similar to i hope im not coming off as a fanboy here since i do think the ps3 is a great console , i just wanted to point out some errors in the review , apart from which the review is very well written .

when it comes down to buying a new gaming system i would recomend the ps3  .

it can do almost everything out there like playing games , surfing the internet , and playing blu    ray discs  .

it is everything i wanted it to be othere than the fact it cannot play ps2 games .

i did all the research and is planning on buying a xbox 360 but ended up with a playstation 3 due to my decision that blu    ray will win  .

i am now glad that i did that  .

it upconverts well and even my home copied dvd's look better  .

the games are catching on , but i now dedicate less time to gaming due to graduating from college  .

the only thing that bothers my very ocd self is that i hate to stick a memory stick in the front and leave the top sticking up  .

looks tacky and just bothers me  .

other than that , no problems whatsoever and have been pleasantly surprised .

the playstation 3 seems to be more of a powerhouse of multimedianess than a game system , but it does still deliver a few ground    breaking games along with the cheapest format of blu    ray  .

a lot of good features make the ps3 a good buy  .

check out my reviews of the xbox 360 and the wii to get a better idea of which to buy .

client asked that i integrate the ps3 into a home theater system  .

looks great on the samsung 63 plasma  .

however , there is not i/r control port for use with other remote control systems  .

had to as the schmartz usb adaptor for control with the ur remote system  .

the system is in a cabinet and generates a fair amount of heat when on  .

as a blu    ray player it is inefficient  .

it consumes 170 watts versus the average blu    ray player at 25    30 watts  .

with a scientific atalanta dvr and the ps3 in the same cabinet a ventilation fan must run 24/7 to keep down the heat buildup adding to the inefficiencies of the system  .

the ps3 menu system is creative but awkward and programming the ur remote required many steps to achieve simple commands  .

an alternate set of direct control commands would be very helpful for integrators .

ps3 is an awesome gaming machine  .

the graphics are stunning with quick load times and great controllers  .

the other features such as the media server and the web browser are cool too but the major flaw in the system is the loud loud fan  .

it's ok when you just start the machine , but it has a 2nd gear that it kicks into about 10 minutes into a game or movie does not bother me at all for gaming , but when i'm watching a movie with the stunning blu ray picture and that fan revs up it's really annoying  .

you literally have to turn up the volume to drown it out i cannot believe all of the hype about this being a great blu    ray player  .

the picture is awesome , but believe me , the loud fan really detracts from the experience also , it's a pain not to be able to use your universal remote with it (since it's bluetooth only)  .

i personally think that sony did a good job on this , but the price is outrageous  .

the graphics are outstanding  .

yet , i give it a seven , why  .

because all you can do with it is sit on the couch , eat chips , and hold the controller  .

i like the new wireless tech , but i hate the price  .

i would give it a 9 if the price for the 80gb is $399  .

but really people , you are only buying another computer with a single os that plays what its programmed to play .

i expected to be more impressed  .

i barely use it  .

i have both and xbox360 and ps3 on a high def tv  .

the ps3 is used more as a movie player than anything else  .

most games you buy for xbox u can get on ps3 but the xbox i find playes the games better and more of your friends are likely to have a xbox over a ps3  .

i did notice the picture quality for upconverting picture is beter for the ps3 when watching movies rather than on the xbox , which is also noiser , however the xbox wins hands down because the controller the gameplay and the onine experiance is much better you get what you pay for when it comes to online play  .

if you want nice cheep blue ray player id buy the ps3 other than that its basically garbage cause its not that apealing either .

i think they should drop the price another 100 and sweaten up the deal by adding a new and cool gmae at on extra price  .

otherwise they are going to loose a lot of money and have to pull it off of the shelves every where .

if you play by yourself this system is fine  .

if you like playing online and talking to your friends get an xbox 360 .

is fixed 3 times for diferentes reasons and less that 2 years  .

i 'm average game player 2 hours a day sometimes 3 times a week  .

and the most scary thing is my 2 friends have the same problems with theirs  .

sony supost to be a respectable bussines but i belive with the ps3 something wrong happed  .

to the reviewer of cnet and all the other people that that said that this console does not have a reliability problem i invite them to put this search in yahoo or google ps3 yellow light of death , this is the equal to the red ring of death , i know because it happenede to me when i tryed to play gta4 , i downloaded the updates and 20 minutes later it crashed , the ps3 has been in the sony repair center for about 3 months now and my xbox 360 elite that i bought before the ps3 is still up and working and i am still enjoying halo 3 and gears of war , while my copies of drake gta4 and resistance for ps3 are being used as decorative pieces of my room  .

great product , when it works .

i is so excited to get it , but i returned it after only 3 days after coming across so many things i didn't like  .

first , the psn (playstation network) is terrible  .

i hated how you make a user name and then it is permenant and you cannot change it  .

they should have at least emphasized more that you need to pick one that you like , and not just make one quick to try out the online play  .

second , the account system is no good  .

i hated how each account could only use that accounts save games , music , etc  .

this became an issue when i wanted to make a new psn user name and i had to delete my account and make a new one , which also ended up erasing my save games and everything else  .

another issue is simply the speed of the system  .

hours of updates (5 hours for mgs4) , game installations , and just the speed of everything else  .

when trying to select music or simply navigate through the music , it would freeze up and load and   me off  .

also , i hated that it is limited to only mp3 format songs  .

i tried to put my itunes library on it , and ended up only getting half the songs because all the  .

aac format songs and all other formats were skipped  .

plus , it is very complicated even finding the mp3's on my portable hard drive and it took forever to copy them to the system  .

oh oh oh and do not forget the ps3 is not yet capable of playing your music during gameplay  .

this is the last straw in my ownership of the system , and i took it back the day i realized this on top of all the other issues i had if i had any suggestions to make , i would say wait on getting the system  .

let sony at least try to work out all the issues that currently exist on the ps3  .

it had the potential to be a good system , but they released it with way too many problems at a much too high price  .

the decision is yours , but all i know is i used to be a die    hard fan of the sony playstation over all other consoles , and now i am seriously considering an xbox .

first , ps3 is great for games and players who don't care about online play  .

the interface for this is great and very smooth  .

styling of interface is very impressive  .

the systems flexibility to becoming a computer is pretty cool for hobbyists or even serious programming here are a few suggestions to developers that could help complete ps3 for me as an online gamer    fix bluetooth headset delay or manufacture an accessory that user another connection type  .

hard to play games when playing as a team  .

hope this works better later as it is a great idea    needs ir there are some many remotes out there that are universal and having multiple remotes is just cumbersome  .

although , the game pad is quit smooth in surfing around the menus    needs vibration in controller  .

at least , i've seen it as an option for game play  .

(i have ps3 , 80gb)  .

my hands hurt because these controllers are so tiny  .

make some for american hands  .

we are a big people some of use are 6' 4 and do not have child like digits    in game music  .

people might like other music i do not know , evangelical gospel while capping aliens    need access to main menu while in game  .

sony we could be buying something while waiting for a next game round    ability to chat with friends and not need to sign out to play a game    would like to see what other games people have on my friends list  .

be cool if players could see other players stats and reputations anyhow , hope the developers get suggestions in their in boxes .

just hope you don't have to call customer service for any reason after you make a purchase  .

sony requires you as a customer to be perfect , no room for simple human error we purchased a game from their online store to download into the console , but it did not seem to work  .

so we switched cards and tried a second time , which is succussful  .

turnes out the first transaction went through , but we thought no big deal , we'll just call customer service to refund the mistake  .

they replied no refunds  .

talked to a superviser , no refunds  .

i asked if anyone at sony had the power to refund a transaction and she said no  .

wow , not even the president of sony has the power or athority to make a $20 refund playstations no refund policy is so rigid they said they are willing to lose my family as a cutomer than rufund a simple mistake  .

no joke , i really asked the supervier if she is willing to lose us so be it .

the system has no poor durability and sony has terrible customer service .

i will never buy a sony product again  .

i called customer service for my ps3 problem and they told me that i would have to pay $169  .

00 plus tax to have it fixed or replaced by a refurbished unit i told them that it is only 13 months old but sony just don't care  .

hey i'm glad my lcd tv is a sharp  .

you would think that one month pass the warranty period that sony would help but they just do not care  .

maybe that's why they now have financial problems .

this is not worth anyones time it has bad hardware issues and so little games , no gamer can have fun .

system broke , sony does not stand behind it's product worst purchase i've ever made  .

0 stars .

if you do not play and just want to use your ps3 as a blu    ray reader , buy something else .

bluray player stopped working after 3 months of light use  .

i started the warranty claim 4 weeks ago and i just spent 30 minutes on the phone with sony and they still cannot tell me when the ps3 will be returned to me  .

i regret buying a sony product  .

i have had similar problems in the past with sony portable electronics and sony home audio .

never by this system unless you like to waste money  .

please don  .

t think i  .

m just being nasty because i didn  .

t get what i wanted read this review and then go to other fourms and read what hundreds of thousand of other ps3 owners have to say    to start yes this system is great in all aspects of what it is designed to do and we loved it as we loved the very first one to come out and all inbetween  .

unfortunately unlike the others the ps3 has very seriuos flaws  .

we have the 2007 60gb model of the ps3 and treat it like gold kept it dusted cleaned the lasers with ps3 approved disk cleaner and followed their instructions to the t and even bought the exturnal fan for added protection , paid just under $600  .

00 for it so why wouldn  .

t we  .

after only 1 year and 1 month the ps3 stopped reading all disks it won  .

t even run the disk cleaner  .

this when i started searching the net to find a solution and so far i haven  .

t found one and i have been reading and searching for days  .

i have found that this is an extreamly common problem and that the only thing sony will do if you are past the warrenty or if you have lost your receipt is send you a box to return the system to them and they will be happy to fix yours or send you a refurbished one and in either case a bill of $177  .

45 for their trouble  .

i asked the customer support agent if this seemed right that i should pay about $600  .

00 for the system and after only 1 + year i should then have to pay an additional $177  .

45 to continue using my system and whats stopping this from happening again soon or later  .

she replied  .

well sir we do offer a one year warrenty and that these type of thing will happen with all electronics and that you can expect them to keep working for ever , but if you do want us to fix your system we have a 90 day warrenty that comes with the fixed ot refurbished system  .

i then said well then i should be say for another 3 months then but whats stopping me from having to do this all over again in 4 or hopefully more months and that if you check out the fourms of the hundreds of thousands of other people that this has happened to you would see that this is a reoccuring problem and it will most likely happen again with in 1 or 2 years at best  .

she then replied  .

well sir we can  .

t garuantee it won  .

t but i would doubt that it will  .

so i  .

m sorry to right a novel but this is a problem that i think is criminal and everyone should be aware of what will probably be in their future if they buy a ps3  .

i turly wish i would have done some research before i bought this system  .

xbox has some simular problems but give much better service and in most cases repalce system for free  .

i won  .

t be fixing this system and my many years on deadication to sony products especialy the play stations is now over and with the recent bad economy and sony laying 5000+ employees off i would say every lost customer counts i hope this has helped and please don  .

t just take my words for it do some research for your self .

sony is incredibly cheap with this one  .

i purchased a bundled package (available in japan) , with two controllers and my planet  .

to my surprise , only one cord is provided for a single controller ; rendering the second bonus controller worthless  .

further , no cord for hdmi output which you figure would be included standard considering you are still paying more than 400 bucks for the 'so called' discounted system , not to mention the games are designed for high def play  .

analog output is miserable  .

load time is long considering the system's core power  .

only two usb ports (for the freaking controllers  .

i have been faithful to sony for years , but the disappointment of the ps3 has really put me over the top  .

i think many japanese consumers share my sentiments , as well , as there has been a recent shift to the xbox 360  .

the xbox failed miserably in japan , but the 360 sure is doing very well as of late  .

with japanese consumers turning their back on the ps3 , it is certainly doomed for imminent failure  .

for your own sake , please , please stay away from the ps3 .
