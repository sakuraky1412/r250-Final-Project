i stayed 4-nights here while on work at tempe , which turned out so near yet so far from the hotel .
it was not easy catching a taxi from here as it depended on whether any guests were coming to the hotel .
most of my travel to and from work needed a walk to the main road at prince 's highway and a wait for the public bus coming every 30 minutes .
nearest train station is actually at wolli creek , a good 1 km and 15 minutes walk from the hotel , and not the airport station , which appears to be so on the map .
as such , do not consider using the airport station as a hub to get to the city , as it is a much longer walk along the highway .
shuttle bus between the airport and hotel costs aud $ 6 per trip , and is definitely not a cost effective way to get around , especially when i got my weekly multi-ticket taking me almost everywhere around sydney from just about aud $ 70 .
taxis are also quite impossible to catch if you are returning from a suburban area like tempe .
however , one would not have any problem travelling back from the city as cabs are always abundant there .
so much about transportation and accessibility , i would rate the other aspects of the hotel as average , considering that its condition looked rather aged , but nevertheless clean .
there was also suprisingly no aircraft noises from the rooms , . . .
