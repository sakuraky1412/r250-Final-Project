i'm sick of reading reviews of this player where people are knocking that there's no eject button on the remote  .
if the player's remote did have an eject button would it also take the disc out for you  .
no , you have to get up  .
so when u get up push the eject button on the player itself  .
and people also knocking this player for not having wi    fi , do not buy this one then  .
it's not a con of this player , if you want wi    fi , buy a player with it  .

fantastic player  .
i do not think that it is given a fair rating  .
am i the only one who buys a blu    ray player to play blu    rays  .
while it may be a nice idea to include all sorts of streaming features , it would seem as if none of the manufacturers can get those players right  .
if you research , you will find that panasonic's players , while really nice , will randomly pause movies for 5 to 10 seconds  .
samsung players have to be unplugged and plugged back in to keep the netflix streaming working , and so on  .
if you're looking for a nice blu    ray player that just works , you should check this one out  .
i is just looking for a straight forward blu ray player (i really don't care about the bd live stuff and have not used it yet)  .
for the price of $150 cdn at best buy it does what i want for a good price watched a normal dvd on the upscale tonight and it looked great as well this is very easy to setup through an hdmi connection , remote is pretty simple  .
i am impressed so far .
looking forward to have some moving visualization function during usb mp3 , wma play back  .
some thing like in window media player web browser is an intresting feature to be in home video product now .
great bd player  .
its major flaw (maybe an issue sony has on a larger scale) is the lack of an eject button on the remote  .
i'm happy with my purchase .
sony is still my top choice of blu    ray player along with samsung .
i would recommend this product , especially if you can get it for under $100 .
sony never make a dud product  .
when the price is right they cant be beat .
the sony bdp    s360 is a great bluray player , but with all the competition out there that offers more bells whistles it's hard to recommend it  .
however , if you are just looking for a solid , great looking player with excellent bluray video quality , great sound , good dvd upscale quality , and no eject feature on the remote then this player is for you  .
i personally prefer sony movie disk players thats why i made the purchase  .
i would have rated this 5 stars , but it only got 4 stars due to the basic remote control with lack of the eject mute button (s) from now until july , 6 2009 amazon offer free sony blu    ray player with purchase of select samsung hdtvs  .

for $250 , i thought that this player is inexpensive and carried a good value  .
the player is ready for bd live out of the box and had onboard decoding for dts truehd and ma which the s350 did not have  .
i also found that the player is smaller compared to the s350 and had a nicer design  .
it is also extremely quiet compared to my ps3  .
the pq and aq is quite impressive this player also had some problems  .
the pq and aq's performance is impressive , but one thing that sony failed to deliver is the loading times  .
the loading times were just ok , but pretty slow compared to my ps3  .
there is also no eject button on the remote , but that can be easily resolved by borrowing or purchasing a remote from the s350  .
navigating through more complex menus is also a little sluggish , but simple ones were fine  .
overall , i thought that this player is great for the price and i recommend it for anybody looking for an affordable bd player with impressive pq and aq .
i like the player a lot and do not care for streaming capabilities or internet connection  .
i use these player for playing movies in my home theatre  .
i try to stay away from sony products because of their stance drm  .
i've had more problems with that crap  .
but for the price , this is an excellent entry player and the price of $99 is just right  .
i have not tried it yet , but according to sony's support site it will support and external hard drive for blue ray live content  .
right now i'm using a 16gb flash key that seems to work great .
overall for our first blu    ray this has really converted us to the new media  .
we don't feel the dvd playback is as good as it could be , so we suffer a little when watching regular dvds  .
do not kid yourself , you can tell the difference between blu    ray and dvd  .
if we had to purchase a player , we probably would have gotten a model with more features (like streaming netflix and with on    board memory) .
the setup menus are kind of cumbersome and not user friendly i'll survive but not sure my wife can  .
this is my second sony dvd player and i'm surprised the remotes are kind of cheap looking and they don't have an eject button  .
might seem like a nit , but when every other manufacturer in the world seems to have an eject function on the remote , you wonder how much trouble or expense it could be for sony to add one  .
it's nice to finish your movie , hit the eject on a remote , and walk up to retrieve your disc , rather than turn the lights up to find the unlit button on the unit  .
when you first turn the unit on , the home screen (setup) comes on but you cannot get rid of it until you insert a disc  .
i've hit every button on the remote , looked in the operator guide , went to the web for help could not find anything that would lose the annoying screen  .
maybe not the biggest problem as such , but when you are watching a movie and press the home button to change a setup feature or if you hit it by accident , you cannot get rid of it , you have to eject your movie an reinstall it  .
this may be design intent or just a messed up player , but after reading the scare stories about internet firmware updates (turns your unit into a brick) , i'm exchanging my sony for a samsung , panasonic , lg anything but sony blu    ray .
overall , for my first bd player , i'm mostly satisfied  .
the player is small , easy to hook up and easy to setup  .
the picture quality is exceptional (as i expected) and things are good  .
once i got everything hooked up and working , that is the problem with this model (and others , i suspect) is that the hdmi 1  .
3 implementation in the player is not backwards compatable  .
when i connect the player to my 2004 built hdtv (reported to use hdmi 1  .
1) , the player does not even recognize that an hdmi capable device is connected to it  .
no video is displayed on the screen except for the power    on splash screen , which disappears as the player initializes when i connect a slightly newer lcd tv (possibly hdmi 1  .
2) to the player , it recognizes the tv as being connected , but does not display any video other than the initial power    on splash screen  .
it does follow any changes in the output mode of the player  .
480i , 480p , 720p , 1080i and 1080p signal inputs are all reported by the tv , but there's no video since sony is one of the creators of the hdmi specification , i am perplexed why they would make a player that does not have the backwards compatibility that is reported by every hdmi site i have visited  .
fortunately , my tv does have component video inputs , so i can still get 1080i video (the best this tv will display) and i'm happy with it  .
i just am tired of built    in obsolescence when it's not supposed to be there .
i wanted a lower end bluray player to replace an old dvd player so i could watch prerecorded high def movies on my new sony hdtv  .
from the first the sony s360 is unreliable  .
though easy to connect and use , about 1/3 of the time it fails to either load or finish playing without an audio/vido malfunction  .
this happens not only with regular dvds but also with bluray movies  .
there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the problem since very often movies that will load one night , will not load or play properly the next  .
some discs never load at all  .
if your sony is unreliable and within the one year manufacturer's warranty you can get a free refurbished unit  .
i did not know this , and since i am two weeks past the warranty date , i must pay $123+tax  .
since i can pay a new bluray player from a different manufacturer for a little more than that , i am going to go in that direction .
look elsewhere  .
there are plenty of choices in the same price range that will do more .
do not buy this unit if you wish to watch blu    ray movies .
my main complaints were the ones above but now , after less than two months , it is refusing to play most of the blu    ray disks in my library while it plays dvd's without complaint  .
yes , they're all official releases , and yes , i upgraded the firmware to the latest version yesterday  .
i just had to come here and tell anywone who will listen how pissed i am at sony , the originators of blu    ray , making two such dismal products and convincing me to buy them  .
i bought an lg for about the same price today (sorry , i forget the model)  .
honest , i do not work for them or have anything to gain from promoting them  .
but their machine is miles ahead of the 360 , no contest whatsoever  .
the several movies i've tried (startup only) have been in progress within about 1/3 to 1/4 of the time the sony takes  .
this is the way it should work , with performance close to the dvd player i used to have  .
plus with a network connection the lg plays youtube videos , very cool , and has software that lets me serve pictures and videos from any computer on my network .
the player is just ok with major flaws be it the fault of new technology i  .
blu    ray , producers putting out movies with non standard code , or sony's way of either blowing off the consumer , or inability to stay up to speed with technology  .
my suggestion is to steer clear of this unit , look at samsung or lg  .
