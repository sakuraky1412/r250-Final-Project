$$;
Pros:. More than the average GPS system for the same price. Many options that are on other brands price higher.. 
Cons:. The only thing negative things are that the slow times acquiring GPS siginal. Also the window mount can no be tightened, so I use a little electrical tape.. 
Summary:. This was purchased in December 2007 as a Christmas gift thorugh Amazon.com at a cost of $150.00. Navigon also was offering a rebate of $50.00 with proof of purchase. Thus it made a great deal for only $100.00. Unit offered alot more the other brands at this price, which were base models.. 

$$;
Pros:. Free traffic, Lane Guidance, Text to speech, Photo realiztic juction views, and Speed warnings. 
Cons:. none! I'm very pleased with everything this gps has to offer.. 
Summary:. I'm very happy with my personal Navigon 5100. Being a field service engineer, it helps me get out to my customers on time and it cuts time because I know exactly where I'm heading. The points of interest work great for someone not familiar with the surrounding area. I'm currently using it in Elko, NV (a pretty remote area) and it's working great. A must have before Navigon starts requiring a subscription for traffic.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Traffic control 2. Maps 3. Design. 
Cons:. Just a little bit slow, but it's nothing comparing to the others features. 
Summary:. I read a lot of bad reviews, but I still order that unit, and to be honest I really like it. It's just works, you know. On the other hands I had a megellian 3100 wich is very fast, but when I drive, I like how's navigon looks like, the menu, the map, the features, the traffic control is amazing. it's showing 20-25 milles ahead what's happening on the road. Isn't that cool. I had a different kind of navigations all this years: Co-pilot, TomTom, Garmin (which is I really hate), Magellian - and they all works, but Navigon, just really works for me. That's all.. 

$$;
Pros:. quick routing, intuitive menus, free lifetime traffic and zagat ratings, tons of info onscreen if you want it, very accurate. 
Cons:. a bit bulky for a 3.5", "love it or hate it" dash mount. 
Summary:. I bought my unit on ecost.com. It was a refurb, but I think the only thing done to it was that the software was updated to 1.2 and the maps were updated to 4th quarter 2008. I read quite a few negative reviews on Navigon 2000 and 5000 series units and was hesitant to buy until I read 2 or 3 reviews of how awesome these little buggers are after you do a free software update.. Since mine already had the new software on it, I experienced nothing but bliss out of the box.. It has all the bells and whistles needed for a GPS, but nothing else (no MP3 player or picture viewer). I'm sure those things (along with many others) could be hacked somehow (it's running Windows CE core).. The voice of this unit is quite soothing and pronounces street names very well. The routing is very quick, even compared to my more expensive updated Garmin nuvi 255 (which was stolen). I've found that the routes calculated are indeed the shortest routes (it even factors in traffic!). Gotta love those software updates eh?. The only things I don't particularly like about this unit are the power button (it does not "click") and the smallish screen (compared to the overall size of the unit).. I would highly recommend this unit to anyone who is looking for a cheap, fully featured GPS... as long as you are savy enough to preform a simple update :). 

$$;
Pros:. many problems were fixed. 
Cons:. somethings need to be cleaner. 
Summary:. Comparing it to other GPS systems it is no doubt a winner. The 1.2 update has all of the new features that were lacking. Chain stores, loccal stores, new POI categories. Plus stuff like stadiums just built this year are showing up with the new update... all very good stuff.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface, easy to use, Best looking gps i have seen. 
Cons:. Sattelite fix. 
Summary:. I researched for about 2 months before i purchased this gps. I am so glad that i went with this gps. It is a beautifully designed gps. Slim and Sleek. Very easy to use, even has a take me home button. Where else can u get live traffic right out of the box. The only thing i wished it did have was weather.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good navigation, nice graphics, good text to speech. Quick lock.. 
Cons:. Points of Interest lack major retailers. That's about it.. 
Summary:. I live in a town that is famous for getting lost in. (Check out Mapquest 60546-2231 and look at the street layout.) So I tried it finding some local locations and used the "take me home" function. It made me do a bunch of turns, but it got me to the location and it got me home. For regular destinations, it was great. It gave me prompts before the turn, and just before the turn. Also, I took it on the commuter train (from downtown Chicago) to fool it. Since it was not on a road, it constantly recalculated the route (to get home) and did a good job. The TomTom (which a friend had on a recent trip) did not speak street names, which this one did. All in all, I like it.. 

$$;
Pros:. works very well, has the most up to date maps of garmin, tom tom and mio. 
Cons:. none it works great\. 
Summary:. LOVE IT, works better than my garmin and tom tom. 

$$;
Pros:. Animated menu interface, free traffic reports, 3d reality view, great looking industrial design, nice mounting device. 
Cons:. Price could be a little lower and the volume of the unit really needs to be reworked to be louder. The loudest setting is really not loud enough. 
Summary:. As a GUI (Graphical User Interface) touch panel designer for A/V control systems a major concern of mine was a good looking panel with nice graphics. That may seem odd to some people, but I knew I would have to live with this device on a regular basis. I considered other GPS devices from Tom Tom, Magellan, Garmin and others. The worst graphic quality was on the Tom Tom units and Garmin units, but the Magellan units and Harmon Kardon units all seem to have pretty good GUIs. Theyre not nearly as good as the Navigon products by my judgment. This is partially due to the lower color bit-depth and displays resolution capabilities of competing GPSs LCD touch panel monitor screens. A secondary reason is just poor and outdated graphic design, particularly with the Garmin and Tom Tom units. The Navigon 5100's map route lines are free of jagged edges and it easily displays curved lines smoothly in contrast to its competitors. Its graphical elements also have semi-transprent features, nice smooth gradients and animation that make this unit the very best in the GPS industry.. Of course the looks don't stop with the display screen itself. The Navigon's industrial design can be compared to the quality of what we've all seen from Apple computers or a Jaguar XKR. Sexy, slim-sized styling and a cool futuristic looking mount are traits of this unit. One thing that some people might not realize is that the displays mount actually has a recessed ball-type joint that allows you to angle the screen about 15-20 degrees in either direction and you can rotate the ball mount up to 360 degrees as you face it. Im not talking about the twisting mounting action as that is a separate feature. Marketing materials and the company's website fail to show this in pictures or mention it in descriptions and at one point it was a concern of mine so in case anyone else has a similar concern the mount is quite useful and adjustable. Another useful feature of the mount, and GPS unit itself, is it's ability to be displayed either horizontally or vertically. An option within the units set up allows you to switch the display screen to vertical if desired with the horizontal orientation being the default. The twist on-mount can park in either verticle or horizontal positions. As a suggestion, it would be a good idea if the company offered a shorter length mount either as an available accessory, or ordering option to give customers additional mounting options. It might even be interesting if they offered a reverse or upside down oriented arm. It's kind of hard to explain what I mean by that with words, but it you look at pictures of the arm you might figure out what I mean. Another reviewer mentioned that this mount is flimsy, but I totally disagree as it is actually very sturdy. I've mounted it in many different locations on my cars windshield and it held well in all cases and positions. There is a switch that you have to flip to secure the suction cup tightly on your windshield so maybe the person who complained about that didn't figure that out. A tip for future owners of the twist on mount: Always rotate it in a clockwise motion for both mounting and un-mounting. There is a little button on top youll have to press before removing the unit. I'd also like to see a hard carrying case for the unit included in the price or as an accessory option. Currently it does come with a tastefull suede type cloth bag. Also different face plate overlays like carbon fiber styles, solid color options like white, blue, red, yellow or green and different gloss woodgrain finishes would be a very cool add-on accessory item. Don't get me wrong, the titanium chrome faceplate is cool, but alot of people might want to give their unit more of an individual look or match it better integrate with their interior. Of course, this is just out-of the-box thinking.. As far as functionality goes, the Navigon 5100 also has a very handy feature called "Reality View" which automatically pops up a 3D image of freeway intersections that arrows and exit signs to help guide you to the right lane. As far as I know, this is a first in the portable GPS industry. Other cool features include the free traffic reports that can (if you choose) re-route you automatically around traffic problems. Data is received and compiled from multiple radio stations using the well established RDS (Radio Data System) service and compiled to provide real time traffic updates. Navigon marketing publications call this "TMC" (Traffic Message Channel). Some competitors offer similar TMC services for a monthly or yearly subscription fee, but with the Navigon GPS it is offered free for life with the 5100 and 7100 models. For the soon to arrive entry level priced Navigon 2100, the TMC will be offered as an add-on option at an additional expense. Some reviewers have complained about the TMC antenna that is included as far as how it looks and etc.. but it does seem quite petty if you ask me. The antenna is really very small and really you don't even need to use it. I get perfect traffic report reception and I never hook up the TMC antenna. Perhaps this maybe an issue for people living in areas where FM stations are rare or hilly regions where FM strait line propogation signals might be blocked. So far I don't see the need to use the included TMC antenna in my area.. For those of us with a "lead foot" the Navigon 5100 also displays graphics with speed limit signs in real-time and can warn you when youre over the limit. This feature can be turned off, or customized according to your city and highway driving habits. For example, I set the speed limit warning to tell me when I'm 10 mph over the speed limit on city streets and 15 mph over on the highway routes. Don't tell the highway patrol!. As far as traditional GPS functionality, the unit seems to be just fine as far as speed and accuracy. Of course, I live in Las Vegas so this might be partially why I haven't experienced any problems so far. However, I live in a fairly new part of town and all of the streets, including side streets are displayed. As far as maps, I'm not sure just what all the hype is about that other people talk about different brands. Most GPS units in the US use the same service called NAVTEQ for all of their map data with the only exception I know of is Tom Tom GPS units which use the Tele Atlas system. For example, my brother owns a Magellan 4040 and it also gets all of its map data from Navteq as well and it's been wrong a few times when we've been in his car so I'm not sure how much credence I would put on other peoples claims as to one brand working so much better than another in this catagory. The Navigon 5100 uses the Sirf Star III chipset that takes data from up to 20 GPS satellites at a time and so far the unit has been very fast and accurate placing my position within 20 feet or less. This may not work as well in high rise city locations like NYC as some other reviewers have claimed, but it seems like a tall building might affect just about any other brand GPS the same way. So far, Ive experienced no problems with the speed or processing performance of the unit that uses a Samsung 2440 400 MHz processor running on Microsoft Windows CE Net 5.O embedded operating system. There has been some confusion about the unit's SD memory capacity. At one point some owners expected the unit to have a 4GB card included with the unit because the units specifications listed it's maximum capacity as 4GB. This means the slot can accomodate up to a 4 GB SD card and does not mean that the unit ships with a 4GB card. It's kind of like your PC's computer specs when they say it can accept up to 4GB RAM but then the PC itself is only shipped with 1GB because that is the standard configuration. The Navigon 5100 comes with a 2GB card which so far seems to work without any performance problems or ill effects. SD card comes pre-loaded with the US/Canadian maps. It does not include the 4 GB card but one could easily upgrade on their own if they felt it was necessary.. Yet another useful feature is the selectable mode of the GPS as it can be set to Driving, Pedestrian or Bicycle modes. For example, if youre walking down a sidewalk against the traffic on a one way street the device won't try to re-route you in pedestrian road. I'm not too sure how it works in bicycle mode or what the difference would be as I haven't tried that mode out yet.. There are a few cautions I would like to point out about this device before you decide to purchase it. For one, a home A/C adapter is normally not included in the box with the 5100, though it does come with the car charger. However, I purchased the unit from a well known TV shopping network's online store and they included the home A/C adapter with the unit and their price was also about $100 cheaper than other online stores. The reason I mention this is if you decide to purchase the A/C home adapter separately it will end up costing you nearly $100 because you will have to buy the adapter from the company's website which ships it's accessories from Germany. Most of the cost is for the overseas shipping. At the products price point it should have had the adaptor included in the retail package box as an included feature. I was a little lucky I guess that the company I bought it from included it in the price. A minor irritation is the POI categories list will display all of the POI types even if you have deselected them in the options menu so this makes it irritating to scroll down when searching within the POIs All categories list. However, it's important to point out that the POI's deselected will not appear on the map if you have deselected POI catagory in the options list. A final criticism, and important one, would be the units lack of volume output for the speakers. With the unit turned up all the way it still could use considerably more sound output capability. This problem needs to be corrected in future models as I have read similar concerns from other Navigon owners. Overall, I would highly recommend the Navigon 5100 or the 7100 for those who want the larger display and blue tooth capability. As for myself I wanted a smaller unit after playing with my brothers Magellan 4040 I decided a wide screen was a little too big for my personal taste. Compared to other choices Navigon seems to have a lot of unique features to offer. The low volume issue and lack of an included 120V A/C adapter (from most stores) results in rating this unit 9 out of 10.. 

$$;
Pros:. Design and great features - free traffic and Reality View. 
Cons:. More customization. 
Summary:. I just ate a restocking fee on my TomTom XL and thought I would try out this new Navigon company I have read about. Overall, I am happy with the 5100 after two weeks of use.. The highlights: I like that the 5100 has these two features that add to the navigation experience. Traffic is a cool feature...easy to use and warns you automatically and it is free. TomTom wanted over $60 per year for this! Reality View is cool too - shows you pictures of upcoming highway exits with arrows for guidance. Great design. I have not had any issues with the routing - maps seem very accurate. Plus, the maps and menus look premium - not cartoony.. My concerns: My first GPS fix when I powered it on seemed to take a long time, but that has not happened since the first time. Some extra customization options would be nice.. Overall, I would highly recommend this product - especially because of these new features.. 

$$;
Pros:. I compared the Nuvi with the 5100. The Navigon has a superior recalculation rate faster than Nuvi. The most significant difference was the lane assist which shows you where you need to be on major ramps. Also Navteq has the best POI data.. 
Cons:. The sound isn't blaring like the garmin's but i'm not deaf so that didn't matter much. In areas with tons of construction turn off the avoid traffic because its faster . Can't load your own POI's like garmin's POI loader...bummer!. 
Summary:. I like the Navigon over the garmin because it works better. Garmin still hasn't caught up to technologies that Navigon pioneered. The nuvi finally added text to speech and some 3-d view. Navigon still has live traffic information for life and yes it is accurate complete. They also have a reality view that shows you what your exit looks like on the highway. This is so important when exiting highway you've never been. Until Garmin catches up with the technology out there i'll over look the minor bells and whistles of extremely obnoxiously high volume and being able to load my own custom POI's. As a side note, If you're driving and you have so much noise in your car that you need to use Garmin's volume to the max you shouldn't be driving it's dangerous! And you can add a custom point to a Navigon you just can't batch them in with the very nice POI loader. You have to add them in one at a time.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, built-in subscription to traffic updates, can work landscape as well as portrait display. Sound is OK. The windshield mount is different from other brands, but I like it.. 
Cons:. It usually takes a minute or two to lock onto satellite. I've never seen it take 7 minutes like the review stated. But I'm usually half a mile down the road before it locks in. It would be nicer with a larger display, but you get what you pay for.. 
Summary:. I've used it for several weeks now. It has sent me down an unpaved road one time, but aside from that, seems to find as good a route as I can find myself. (The unpaved road was a shorter route.). 

$$;
Pros:. traffic, POI's, lane assist. 
Cons:. Small font, slow load time from cold start. 
Summary:. I purchased this GPS and was on the road no longer than 2 hours from delivery. I was headed for Hilton Head and had no directions, just an address. (('m not crazy I had a laptop just in case) It worked flawlessly. Half way we decided to look for a hotel. The POI worked great. The Lane assist is a great option! The live traffic only came into play around Charlotte, NC but we where traveling on a saturday morning so really no use for it.. I have used a Garmin before and like it's ease of use. The Navigon is a little confusing from the start but with time(and patience)it is well worth it!. Look for it on sale!!!! I got mine for 179 from Circuit city! don't pay $500!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. reality view, traffic alerts, text-to-speech. 
Cons:. smallish "buttons" for input, can't find POIs by inputing phone numbers. 
Summary:. I've had my 5100 for about 3 days now. I'm new to the Richmond area, and this machine is so accurate and precise. It is going to help my transition to this new place a lot less stressful. I wish there was an easier way to search for POIs. Overall, love the system...especially the reality view and text-to-speech. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy, easy, easy...and did I say easy?. 
Cons:. A little big, a little slow to boot up.. 
Summary:. I've never been much interested in GPS systems, but having recently moved to a new city I decided to take the plunge. A friend recommended the Navigon and I have to say that so far I've been delighted. It's hard for me to believe that the CNET reviewer described this thing as "on the smaller side" when together the unit and mount seem almost TOO big. However once I got used to it I came to love it. This thing is incredibly easy (even for a techno-idiot like me) and has a lot of handy features. I agree with the previous review that the "take me home" button is a neat thing...especially good for my wife who can't find her way home from the corner store. The realistic views amaze me. And lifetime free traffic information...what are you kidding me???? Buy this thing!. 

$$;
Pros:. lifetime traffic out of the box! see ya later traffic jams!!. 
Cons:. sometimes takes me off highways only to put me back on again. at least it always puts me back on.. 
Summary:. I love my 5100. Just the design is something to love. It's very different looking than any other GPS I've seen. the interface is very easy to use and it is so realistic. I drive a lot for my job and the traffic out of the box was great, no subscription required. I love that it gave me the option to avoid the traffic or ignore the warning. I never leave home with out it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick route recalculation. Zagat POIs. Great 3-D view. Strange routes that actually save time. 
Cons:. Crazy POI update process. POIs easy from some acreens and stupid-hard from other screens. Voices could be louder (depending on car, of course). 
Summary:. Now that prices have dropped, this is a great bargain. Recalculates much faster than Garmin models I've used. Lane Assist and Reality View overlay each other making it easy to get around strange city highways. Never takes 7 minutes to track 3 satellites-- it does take about 2 - 3 minutes (3 city blocks). Noisy compact car makes voice sound faint (plusher cars are kinder to recorded voice). Most probs listed in other reviews result from not updating system at registration and/or not reading owner's manual. It's not that hard an interface.. 

$$;
Pros:. Traffic Info, Trips with mutiple destination , Accuracy. 
Cons:. Interface = Flickering street names, Hard to see current trip info like time, distance, 2 color modes. 
Summary:. I just bought mine few days ago for 2 reasons.. 1)Traffic Info. Try to drive around in Chicago with all the time congested roads.. 2) Multiple destination road planning - very usefull for any salesperson and Realtor.. ----------------------------------------. I used before NAWMAN PiN 570 which is constantly freezing when I am trying see turns or flat 2d map view,plus takes forever to acquire position. Sometimes never. Asked me few times to drive around in a Circle to get to destination where actually I am at this moment. Not very Good when you have a client with you.. --------------------------------------. --------------------------------------. Navigon seems accurate, reality view I just experienced 30 minutes ago on a highway and basically this is dead picture showing the highway view with the signs. Overrated.. --------------------------------------. Menu is not very intuitive, but I will learn it quickly. Seems that it lacks few things I would wish for but I am going keep it.. --------------------------------------. Screens is better readable in the night view.. Street names are flickering and actually I can see next cross street only in the 2d view. 3d doesn't give the detail.. ---------------------------------. Mount. First I was surprised receiving huge piece of plastic, hard to adjust to locate the gps in place I like it to see. Than I just mounted it on top of a radio in my Ho nda Element and I think that actually its high position is better because I do not take eyes off the road down to look for info.. ------------------------------------------. Is telling you street names and when to turn, remaining you right in time before the turn.. So you do not have to look at the screen.. Voice could be little bit lauder on noisy highway.. --------------------------------------------. I AM GOING KEEP IT. ----------------------. ----------------------. Overall I can not imaging how anybody would want gps with single destination routes like in Tom Tom ONE 3RD EDITION. (biggest disapointment in my life since almost every review on line is talking about "routs" in TomTom. What is the point to connect TOM TOM to computer to plan a "route" when the "ROUTE" is accepting only single destination"). 

$$;
Pros:. realistic scenery. 
Cons:. had to tap screen a few times before it would register. 
Summary:. i love my little navigation device. my favorite thing is the "take me home" button. no matter where i am it will get me home.. 

$$;
Pros:. gets me where I want to go. 
Cons:. .. 

$$;
Pros:. The live traffic report keeps me updated on what's going on my way. I can select a different route if I choose to.. 
Cons:. The Reality view, is just a B.S.. 
Summary:. I bought this device thinking It would have a satelite like reality view. They've been advertising saying,it has so called "REALITY VIEW". I strongly disagree. It just another GPS nevigator, and I'm sure you can find other brands of the similar features, at much cheaper price. Yes, I do like the live traffic alerts, very helpful.. I would suggest you look into other devices before you buy this. If the reality view is only thing you're looking into, I beg you please don't buy it.. Abdullah Mamun. President,. spdepot.com. 

$$;
Pros:. good screen, graphics and GUI. 
Cons:. Poor routing, low volume. 
Summary:. I've only used the 5100 for a few days, but for two trips I've gotten routings substantially longer than the route I normally take.. Also, considering this unit comes from a German company, I can't believe that German is NOT one of the language options.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive and fairly easy to use.. 
Cons:. Can barely hear audible instructions. Maps are VERY often incorrect or incomplete. No real address book to speak of. System occasionally hangs. Shortest Route is often NOT the shortest route.. 
Summary:. I bought this item in March ?08 as a replacement for my Navigon Pocket LOOX which was lost when my truck was stolen. Since then I have driven over 120,000 miles in all 48 contiguous states with the 5100 and am very disappointed with its performance in many ways.. The Pocket LOOX had a much louder and easier to understand voice, which is surprising due to its small size in comparison with the 5100. In fact, after the first few days of driving with the 5100, I turned off the sound and have never turned it back on because it is a waste of time.. I was hoping the 5100 would have a larger address book, such as the Magellan Maestro 5310, but it has the same 30 favorite places as the Pocket LOOX.. My two biggest gripes are the out of date maps and the 5100s propensity for freezing up, especially if you make a turn not in the planned route. It doesn?t freeze often, but when it does, the only solution is to do a hard reboot of the system which results in the loss of all route points. The maps often lack streets that have been in existence for several years and many intersections and highway exits that have been changed in the last five years have not been updated. What is really sad is that on occasion Microsoft Streets and Trips, which is notoriously bad at updating its maps has a street or interchange updated and Navigon does not.. In conclusion, I would not have purchased this item had I had the chance to use it for a few weeks first. My intent is to replace it with the Maestro 5310 as soon as I get a chance and keep the Navigon 5100 in my local daily driver. It may be okay for the short trip in your home town, but I wouldn?t want to have to depend on it to get me where I need to go 1000 miles from home.. 

$$;
Pros:. This unit has lots of features not usually found in low end GPS units, including free traffic updates and text-to-speech directions which include street names.. 
Cons:. Mapping software was not accurate on some test addresses, routing was not efficient, voice prompts distorted and not loud enough, voice prompt gave incorrect directions after updating software on Navigon website, outdated POIs.. 
Summary:. Given the feature set and the price I spent for this unit ($149 at Radio Shack), I was excited about my purchase. The excitement faded the day after I bought the unit. I was going to a restaurant I had been to many times in the past, and decided to see how the unit worked. Both my home (starting location) and my destination (La Carreta Restaurant) are in Nashua, NH. I mention this because maybe some of the problems I experienced are specific to my geography. Anyway.... 1. I noticed the Navigon unit was sending me on an odd route to get to the restaurant. Even though I knew the quickest route was to get on Rte 3 (0.5 miles form my house) and take it to exit 3 (just north of the restaurant), I went the route suggested by the Navigon to see how poor the routing was. I then realized that despite having the correct address and zip code displayed as the destination, the unit directed me to a location 2 miles away from the restaurant, in a different zip code. Luckily I was going to a location I already was familiar with and not relying on the GPS unit.. 2. When leaving the restaurant to head home, the unit tried to send me through downtown Nashua rather up the highway. With no traffic, this way takes twice as long because of the lower speed limit and traffic lights. During busier times, the route suggested by the Navigon can take 4 to 5 times as long as zipping up the highway. Even when I ignored the unit and went on the highway, it tried to take me off again at the next exit!. 3. When I took my exit from Rte 3 (exit 7E), the unit told me to take a left at the end of the exit ramp instead of continuing straight (as the map indicated). This was odd, because I hooked the unit up on my way back from Radio Shack and the directions home were perfect taking the same route (rte 3 N to exit 7E). In the interim I had gone to the Navigon website and downloaded a software update, so I am assuming that the software update created this problem.. Based on my experience, I would recommend staying away from this unit, regardless of how good a deal it seems. The main purpose of a GPS is to get you to a destination accurately and efficiently. If it can't do that, it is an expensive dashboard ornament. And when buying ANY GPS unit, be sure to test it against several locations you are familiar with to determine how well it works. Much better to find problems when you are NOT lost and dependent on the unit for guidance than to wait until you are lost. Also, this testing will allow you to return the unit during the seller's return window.. 

$$;
Pros:. Reality view, logo's for POI's, lifetime traffic service. 
Cons:. Really BAD user interface!. 
Summary:. In order to use this device while driving, you need a second person in the car to operate this GPS due to the REALLY SMALL buttons on the touch screen, and you may even have to pull over to the side of the road so that normal motion of the car does not interfere with this. Bought it from Costco for $249 after rebate, but took it back. If the GUI was as good as the little Pharos 150 that was selling for $99.99 after rebate, this Navigon would have been a keeper.. Larger buttons on the screen, and a stylus like other Windows CE device manufacturers include with their units would make all the difference!. TomTom, Garmin, Pharos, V7, even Staples house brand all have much better GUI's. It's too bad as the reality view and screen quality are awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. multiple functions. 
Cons:. poor receiving. 
Summary:. I had before Magellan Maestro and when I paid the premium for free traffic services I tought that I will get something extra. During the driving, you barely hear the directions even though the volume was at maximum. The information were too old and not useful at all. I will return this unit because could not provide value for money..

Pros:. text to speech, zagat ratings, real view. 
Cons:. screwy routing, poor voice quality. 
Summary:. The text to speech feature is great, as is the Zagat ratings and real view.Problem is the things that are most important in a GPS --clear speech and good directions -- are lacking. The routing is downright mystifying, like taking you to the other side of RR tracks and then back again for no reason. The speech is muffled. I got it at a great sale price ($160) but am returning it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have the widescreen version, if I were to actually use the GPS it would be a good screen.. 
Cons:. Slow doing everything. Faster to go to google maps and print out directions and go. Tried to upgrade software, even their website is confusing and even though I registered product keeps ignoring it. No way to quickly contact customer service.. 
Summary:. Do not purchase, try a better/different GPS or just buy a Motorola Droid with FREE GPS via google maps. It's what I use now for everything. Great phone. Worth the $120 I payed for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. The street views are nice. The ease of getting the actual GPS location on the screen is good.. 
Cons:. Routing is poor. The route for a recent trip was illogical and slow, choosing a route with tons of stoplights and traffic problems. I can't figure out how to have it operate while the power is plugged in. Gives excessive and useless instructions.. 
Summary:. For starters the power button operation is silly. You have to hold it at least 6 seconds, then release it to power up. The next big hassle is that I can't figure out how to make it navigate while connected to power. It goes into charge mode and all navigation disappears until it is again unplugged. The supplied windshield mount is cumbersome and illegal here in California. It would block my view in any case. No console mount came with the device. It is extremely slow to start up; the manual says it may take 20 minutes the first time and that if it gets a fix in the first 5 minutes to continue sitting still for 15 more minutes. Right. Unlike my Garmin GPS, I can't see how to easily transfer addresses and files to the Navigon. The device gives excessive and useless information. "Continue on US 101" "Stay on US 101" "Keep left on US 101". We had about a half dozen of these in 5 minutes on a section of freeway with no real complexity. Traffic warnings, when they pop up, are next to impossible to read while driving and to get the navigation screen back you have to interact with the thing. That's always a problem while move, but especially when it is telling you that traffic is a problem directly ahead. Selection of which POIs to show was not logical. This thing makes me feel pretty stupid and I am an engineer, an MBA and a credentialed teacher! Not recommended.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the maps. 
Cons:. even with unit fully charged, it wont turn on...and theres no reset. 
Summary:. waiting for navigon to respond. 

$$;
Pros:. takes me where I want to go. 
Cons:. can not hear the text to speech over the air conditioner. 
Summary:. the text to speech is terrible I called and they said well turn up the volume and I did and they said well that's all there is. I live in Florida and we run the air conditioner all the time it is normal noise. we can not hear the text to speech at any speed. I think they have a poor customer service. I am going to look into another brand with a text to speech that can be heard under normal situations.. 

$$;
Pros:. lot of features for the money. 
Cons:. can't give you proper directions. 
Summary:. The Navagon 5100 gave off the weirdest route from point A to point B; changing the setting from fastest, to optimum, to shortest, to scenic; the Navagon failed constantly on my personal test, including telling me to make a very dangerous and illegal U-turn, with the option of U-turn not allowed; making an impossible left hand turn (the Navagon should have told me to take a different route like the Garmin or Tom Tom). I dont know how going from point A to point B the fastest by telling me to drive 2 miles north, then drive east for .5 miles, then over a mile south, I think if I just drive east .5 miles, and then north under a mile would be much faster? The person that programmed the Navagon must have put his personality into it, making it a stubborn thing. Miss my turn on purpose (cause my route is much faster), and even after a mile, the Navagon still wants me to turn my car around and drive in the wrong direction for a mile cause it thinks it is right? The list is nearly endless, I tested this baby inside out, to try and give it the benifit of the doubt. Tested the Navagon for over a week, loved the features that it has; great bang for the buck. But at the end of the day, yes the Navagon will get you from point A to point B, but not how the local would do it; but more like a lost tourist.. 

$$;
Pros:. free traffic. 
Cons:. sends you turning and turning. Esoteric PIOs included, standard PIO's absent. 
Summary:. Sadly there are bugs in the US version, An update is promised for late this year. This is a great device in Europe but the product line does not seem to have been customized for the US beyond sticking in US maps. Standard Points of Interest such as post offices, major store chains have been left out.. Routing is so convoluted as to defeat advantage of free traffic. If you are very technically inclined you can edit software, via your computer, to adjust routing errors.. 

$$;
Pros:. "cute" if that is all you want. 
Cons:. not for anyone not expert in gps devices. 
Summary:. I've tested this 5100 and the 7100 fo a while now.. It is not for anyone new to GPS as it is very cumbersome interface.. The 5100 and 7100 need to be avoided until the bugs are worked out with software changes. Garmin and TomTom did this a lot when introducing products to the US market. I would wait.. 

$$;
Pros:. Realistic view and free lifetime real traffic. 
Cons:. US is outdated...can't find many addresses and POI sucks (can't even find the nearest Walmart!) and unstable vehicle mount!!!. 
Summary:. Okay, so I was excited about the realistic view and the free lifetime real time traffic receiver but I soon got upset about many things that a standard GPS is supposed to do.. First, map is outdated. It can't find many of the addresses I tried. At times, it does not have some of the streets!!! so I had to call my friend for directions. Second, I was trying to go to the nearest shopping mall, but guess what the POI doesn't have the one of the major shopping malls listed!!! It doesn't even have the nearest Walmart and when it gave me a nearest one it didn't exist. I never had this problem with garmin nuvi or magellan. Lastly, the vehicle mount stinks. Not only is it too bulky it easily comes off especially while I'm driving.. P.S. I called technical support for to ask about a round plastic disc object and how to use it the technical support agent and his supervisor couldn't tell me how to use and told me to common sense!!! Then without any apologies, just told me to go ahead and return the product if I didn't like it.. I am definately returning this piece of trash.. 

$$;
Pros:. Reality View? ( Major Highways ONLY!) Free Traffic Membeship??. 
Cons:. Poor Volume, Poor POI Database, Poor Features &#38; Functions, Weird and Unstable Mount. 
Summary:. I couldn't stand this product anymore and I had to return it. I got sick of it!! It was a nightmare! Like most of you guys, I was thrilled about the "REALITY VIEW" feature, but it's just a trap. It only works in certain highways, Not even the most important or congested ones. The Volume is sooo pooor. The POI database drove me crazy!! It couldn't even locate VERY WELL KNOWN retailers/shopping malls. I always ended up calling my cousin and asked him to look up certain retailers addresses on the internet. For the price it has VERY LIMITED features. Well, that is the main reason why I needed a GPS: TO LOCATE PLACES and TAKE ME THERE! It also lacks of many basic and essential functions that you find on less expensive GPS's. You can't search by Zip Code, (and Intersections I believe), You can't change much of the retarded settings.. Ok, now let's talk about the very few pro's about this product. I'm very unbiased.. Even though the volume was extremely low, but if you stick it to your ears,the pronunciation of most street names was better than most TomTom's. Also; the re-routing was very fast. Faster than my friends'/relatives'Garmins and TomToms. I was surprised too! As far as accuracy is concerned, it was the same as many other similar products. There is always a marginal error in ALL GPS's!!!! In some instances it provided me accurate directions and sometimes it failed. But my friends/relatives have the same problem with their other brands.. In summary, IT'S A MEDIOCRE PRODUCT. I don't know why they sell it so expensive ( even though I bought mine at a BARGAIN price! ) IT DOESN'T EVEN OFFER BASIC FEATURES that other less expensive products. I wouldn't even buy it if they were selling for only $50.. 

$$;
Pros:. It looks nice sitting on my desk because they dont have a repair in U.S yet. 
Cons:. I bought these because of the free traffic alerts I used it 3 times it wasnt to bad sound is real bad though. The fourth time I used it on/off Button broke I called there support.. SURPRIZE NONE. 
Summary:. The unit works ok sound is real bad and maps are very outdated.... BUT the WORST THING &#38; BUYERS BEWARE they have no place to repair them, mine has been sitting on my desk for 3 months because they said there not opening one till after JAN..I dont thing they will its a German Company. IF I was going to buy one for Xmas please buy one where you can get it fixed. I belive there droping them after Xmas because they keep dropping th price on them, if anybody knows where I can get mine repaired let me know.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it worked, it worked pretty well. The battery lasted a while too. 
Cons:. It stopped working midway to a destination, it is fully charged and won't turn on and have found other people with the same problem, it had crappy volume, and the traffic helper was pointless. 
Summary:. I only used this 4 times before it stopped working, there is no way to reset it and it is fully charged. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, I have looked online and there are numerous other people who have had the same problem! It was basically just a big waste of money.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was able to provide directions that would end up where I wanted to go, when it was working. Its website sends thank you automatically generated thank you notes for suggestions--when I emailed a letter seeking help. 
Cons:. It provided out-of-the-way routes that wasted much time and gas. Its POI are close to useless--restaurants that have been out of business for years while missing most gas stations. When it broke within a month, their support was equally useless.. 
Summary:. This was a very bad experience and I it bothers me that CNET's "experts" recommended this rip off because I believed them.. 

$$;
Pros:. LifeTime Traffic Service. 
Cons:. Volume is Horrible EVEN at Maximum Level. 
Summary:. The Navigon 5100 is typical of any other GPS system the Lifetime Traffic was the main reason I bought this particular unit. Living in Los Angeles I thought it would be useful - BUT - the lack of volume completely outweighed the benefit of FREE traffic service. Like I said I'm in Los Angeles the MECCA of traffic so you know the VOLUME had to be really bad!. REALITY VIEW - don't get excited. This is not really an compelling feature. The only reality view is when you are on highway and the road splits. The Reality View pops up with lane assistance. Cute - but not enough to reccommend this GPS.. APPEARANCE - the device has black "piano" finish. BUT the maps themselves are dismal grey and white tones and there is NO CUSTOMIZATION. Too hard to see in daylight.. VOLUME - unless you drive your car with the radio off and window up - do not purcahse this device. You WILL NOT be able to hear the instructions/guidance. Even at MAXIMUM LEVEL - you will need to turn off the radio, let up the windows and drive with no air conditioning or periphial sounds in the car because the sound is RIDICULOUSLY, HORRIBLE and makes this GPS is USELESS!!! Believe me when I tell you, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. I returned the unit and switched brands.. Ultimately Navigon should be ASHAMED for selling such a substandard device..
