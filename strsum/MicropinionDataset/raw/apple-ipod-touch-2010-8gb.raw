Pros:. a regular stereotypical Apple invention, a true Apple product.. 
Cons:. absolutely none. 
Summary:. A great piece of invention.. 

$$;
Pros:. really thin, totally portable, Apple's new Retina Display is a wonder to behold (compared it to someone's iPod Touch 2G), easy and simple user interface, very shiny, 2 camera for video chat, HD video recoding at 720p,. 
Cons:. one word: smudges. 
Summary:. This new generation (4th) iPod Touch has its best upgrades so far since its debut in 2007 with all the thinner body, Retina Display, Apple's A4 chip, gyroscope, and, of course, the 2 cameras. It's still the same music and movie player. It's an awesome little device that's definitely worthy to be called a pocket-computer. The back camera may be a disappointment for some since it can only captures image stills of 960x720 pixel (sucks, right?). Oh well, you have your digital camera anyways. But still, up to now, nothing compares to the iPod Touch as a multimedia device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everythinh. 
Cons:. nothing at all. 
Summary:. Amazing worth the $. 

$$;
Pros:. This is everything I've wanted in an Ipod and more.. 
Cons:. I really can't think of any cons.. 
Summary:. I love the versatility of the Ipod Touch 4G and being able to check my email if I'm out. I also like being able to surf the web and the variety of apps that come with the Ipod touch. There is a large variety of apps available and although the camera doesn't have a flash, there is an app called NightShotD that will lighten any still picture making it nearly perfect. I've found the speed of the camera is fast enough so that pictures are much better than many iphones produce and do not require lightening. You can send pictures by email. It's a great gaming ipod too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Both the front and back camera work great especially with Facetime, the retina display looks beautiful, and the smallersize makes my old 2G ipod touch look like a brick. 
Cons:. Still very new, there are little or no cases for it yet so keep it somewhere safe until then. 
Summary:. This is the best touch update yet, so far i've had no problems with it. 

$$;
Pros:. the facetime, the built in mic. and the camera.. 
Cons:. Everything is great so far. there is nothing wrong with it.. 
Summary:. i love this product just go one from the apple store, and can wait to show it to my friends. as at now am now syncing my app from the old ipod touch onto this baby. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice display, fast, awesome apps, front and back facing camera, super slim design, more awesome apps.. 
Cons:. voice control is sort of hard to use. 
Summary:. I would recommend the 4th gen ipod touch to anybody i know who doesn't have an iphone. 

$$;
Pros:. I love everything about this product. The sound quality is very clear, the screen resolution is great, and the addition of the camera is awesome.. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone. It is much more than just an MP3 player. It's almost like carrying around a small computer in your pocket. I am very satisfied with the product as a whole. It was definitely worth the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's basically an iPhone 4 that doesn't include a monthly bill.. With all the fun of iOS 4 in a better designed iPod.. 
Cons:. As far as photo's go, the quality isn't as good as seen on the iPhone 4.. Even do the monthly bill would have to be included with 3G, I still miss the GPS.. 
Summary:. The bottom line is, the new iPod Touch is better then ever. And has improved a lot more on the last iPod Touch then I expected. Being an iPhone 4 with not bill is probably all you need to here.. If you think the new iPhone is cool, you'll love the new iPod. 

$$;
Pros:. It carries all of the features the iPhone 4 has! Without a contract with the evil AT&#38;T!. 
Cons:. I don't have any!. 
Summary:. If you have enough money to spend and look forward to a smart phone/Mp3 player device, then this is DEFINITELY you number one choice.. Updated. on Sep 8, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen looks significantly better than previous iTouches, still lacking the contrast and vivid colors of the iPhone 4's IPS display, but a great improvement none the less. The cameras work well, and the 802.11b/g/n really bring web pages up fast.. 
Cons:. No flash for the camera.. 
Summary:. Between the great display, HD video camera, front facing camera, mic, and 802.11b/g/n wi-fi the iPod touch 4th gen is a must have for any techy.. 

$$;
Pros:. brilliant screen. fun, simple video capture and edit. Great audio/video playback. Basic apps all you need to be satisfied with purchase.. 
Cons:. more fragile than other ipods. it "multitasks" but not well.. 
Summary:. I have been looking for a new Ipod for a while now, and the Ipod 4G convinced me to finally go out and buy one.. The Touch screen works beautifully, and as someone who frequently reads Webcomics online, I really appreciate the quality of picture and text. It also responds very well to input for games and works so smoothly that navigating quickly becomes second nature.. The camera and microphone captures brilliant HD 720p video and audio clarity that is surprisingly robust. The camera takes pictures at less than 1 Megapixel, but as it's not a true camera, but rather video camera capturing stills, it works rather well. The built in editing tool works very well and is easy to use, although I suggest splurging on the iMovie app in the app store for all those budding speilbergs out there, and at $4.99 it's well worth it.. The audio playback is a good as you can expect from an iPod, with the ear buds once again providing a surprising range of sound, from high-end strings or guitar solos to the lowest of club beats and Double-base Blasts. Navigating your music is simple, and the Genius playlists provide some truly inspired combinations. The video playback is stellar, although I would suggest that people who purchased the 8 gig model, like myself, try and parse down their movie library to about one or two movies you know you love and a third that can change with your preference so you have some room left.. The iPod 4G is slimmer than the 3G, a little taller, and has a nice looking aluminum casing and a glass screen. the back is flat, allowing it to rest on a table better, which comes in handy if you want to set it down to game or type. I will say that it is MUCH more fragile than the previous editions, with the case bending and the glass prone to shattering from the most common of falls, so I suggest purchasing a good case at least, and a screen protector if you're interested in really protecting your investment.. The battery life is great for a device that does so much, but it achieves this at the cost of multitasking. It has the ability to have multiple apps open at once, but they pause mid-action whenever you navigate away from them, meaning you actually have to have them in front of you for them to function.. It means that apps only doenload if you watcch them, but it also means that casual touch users can probably go a couple days without needing to recharge.. All in all The iPod touch 4G is a great multimedia device that is almost indispensable to me. The lack of access to a 3G network is really the only feature missing from making it the perfect device, but it you want that you can just sign up for at&#38;t and get an iPhone. The fragility is really the only issue I have with it, but that is solved with a $20-$30 dollar case. everything else is more of a reasonable exclusion, the camera and "multitasking" being the largest among them.. if you want something that plays music really well, get an iPod classic. If you want a multimedia device that's the closest thing to having a tablet in your pocket, get an iPod touch. you won't be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. hd video cam and a vga front camera with good quality. Now with a embedded mic with outstanding recording capability. I'm not sure with this but for me I think the audio equalizer presets has improved vs the older versions, also with high res screen.. 
Cons:. maybe, the still picture quality.... 
Summary:. This is really a great device... a must have!! I really like the changes in audio eq presets.. bass booster doesnt have any distortion on my music unlike the older version... of course the OFF mode will still be the best... 

$$;
Pros:. gr8 processor....faster than before..improved video quality....loving the feel of it...:). 
Cons:. a lil delicate....bluetooth is just for apple to apple uses....the biggest drawback NO GPS....!!. 

$$;
Pros:. The touch interface is very slick. After a few ajustments of settings, the battery life on this thing is very long. When accessing the internet it's like if you had it on the palm of your hands. It's very quick on loading web pages.. 
Cons:. The back and front cameras are a little disappointment. When taking Pictures they are not too bad, but under a megapixel resolution is not very good image quality. I should give you a fair warning though, this is NOT the best gaming device!. 
Summary:. After about a week of using it, this is how computers of the future should be like: touch interfaces, voiceover functionality but a keyboard is a must. All in all, this device has far surpassed my expectations. Although the picture quality of the photos is not that good, making videos on it is very impressive with the 720p HD recording.. This is a good device for lightweight gaming but if you are going for like Doom 12 or so, it's best if you'd go for a PSP or something because you won't get a lot of battery if you intend to use it for 3D gaming ( like racing games). Certainly the best device I've ever gotten.. Updated. on Oct 4, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Good storage, best touch-screen portable media devise so far.. 
Cons:. Price and base storeage. They have kept it at 8GB since it came out, can't they up the aunty a little and offer 16GB for base model?. 
Summary:. Overall, if your looking to have the best portable devise to have for everyday use, this is it. Only things that keep it down are the price and possibly Apple, if your one of those people.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very portable, slick, and multipurposeful.. 
Cons:. I do not like the fact that the battery life does not last long.. 
Summary:. English 15 PSU. Overall, I am very pleased with the Apple Ipod itouch. I have the 8 gb black itouch and have owned it for about 3 months. I like the fact that it is very light weight, and portable. It is a very useful product. I like the fact that I can use it to link up wirelessly to the internet and check my emails, facebook, etc. Also i enjoy the fact that i can take pictures and record videos with it. My 2nd generation itouch did not come with this feature, and i am glad my new one does. All the thousands of applications that Apple is creating for the itouch is very useful. The itouch is like a small mini computer and i use it for just about everything, minus talking on the phone (which then you would need a iphone). I enjoy listening to my music, and watching movies on the small portable screen. The itouch is very lightweight so i can carry it wherever i go and it can even fit in my pocket. The only thing i dodnt like is that the screen is fairly small, i cant use it as a phone, and the color choices are only limited to black.. 

$$;
Pros:. Smaller, slimmer, lighter, 2 cameras, retina display is amazing, very fast, no performance issues. 
Cons:. the camera is VERY low resolution. 
Summary:. This iPod Touch is just amazing. I am so on awe of it! I had an iPod Touch 2G before, and this iPod is simply amazing! It's beyond words. I loved the iPod Touch 2G when I got it, and I love the iPod Touch 4G.. I like to think of the iPod Touch as a portal to the world. Through the internet, we can easily research a fact, look up the weather, or write on our friends Facebook wall. It is important to have a good portal- and the iPod Touch 4G is BRILLIANT!. The retina display really is the jewel on the crown. It is not possible to see one individual pixel. It simply looks like you're looking at a piece of paper- it does not look as though it is a screen. This is by FAR the BEST screen I have ever seen. EVER.. There are two cameras on this iPod; a forward camera and a rear camera. The rear camera is less than one megapixel and the forward camera is even less. Therefore, the rear camera is just OK. Not amazing, but OK. The forward camera is OK as well. The VIDEO CAMERA is very good. It records in 720P, which is actually turns out to be quite nice. Having a video camera on the iPod Touch is great. Having a DECENT camera is even more amazing! Being able to edit the clips so quickly and export them to YouTube adds to the convenience. I would suggest getting the iMove app. Imagine creating a movie of your vacation, while you're still on vacation!. The video camera works hand-in-hand with the bult-in-microphone. And I must say, that is one damn good microphone! Voice notes sound very clear, and even though the mic is on the back, the sound comes through very well!. The built-in-speaker has become much more prominent by having a grill dedicated to it on the bottom-left side. It sounds much louder, clearer and brighter.. All of the features of iOS 4 work seamlessly on the iPod Touch 4G, from multitasking to voice control! Apple did well with iOS4, and the iPod Touch frames is wonderfully.. In conclusion, the iPod Touch is a wonderful departure from the iPod Touch 3G. It adds many new features such as a decent camera, amazing video camera and the best display i've ever seen. period.. The camera should be a higher resolution, and that is my only criticism. Whether if you are buying an iPod for the first time, or if you are upgrading, this is the BEST iPod Touch so far. I would highly, Highly, HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. App store is packed, sleek and thin design, ease of use is great, simple. 
Cons:. internet connection slow, apps will randomly close [and then Apple just tells me to reboot it and it doesn't work], itunes song previews wont play. 
Summary:. My Ipod is great. Is it glitchy? Ya. And its not just me. Other people who own it [including one of my family members] say the same thing. Ok, ok. I dont have the new one with a camera which I would like but I didnt put that under cons. I would like Apple to be a little bit more supportive with the issues but its great and I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Retina Display, games, camera, decent music playback. 
Cons:. Camera has a terribly low pixel count, primitive multitasking, cheaper Zune devices offer higher quality audio. 
Summary:. While Apple has made some great innovations with the Retina Display, there is little else to be found here that has not already been done by others. The camera is also a nice touch not found in previous models, but it has a terrifyingly low pixel count of less than 1 megapixel, even though it shoots in 720p "HD" video. This is the only problem with the hardware, which is quite nice, actually. However, the software is what bothers me the most. Although the gaming experience is fantastic for a mobile device of this size, Apple's iOS is still generations behind competitors (I'm looking at you, Android). The audio quality is limited due to the fact that Apple is using its signature AAC (aka m4a and m4p) file format, and Zune players offer a much higher quality sound. The operating system also offers only a primitive form of multitasking. That is, when you leave one app and enter another (with the exception of music apps), the app you are leaving pauses what it is doing until you return. This saves a lot of battery life, but doesn't you truly multitask, as in Android, where apps are free to do what they want. I have run into this problem while downloading apps; you must actually be at the home screen for apps to download, and if you are playing a game or browsing the web, your app will not download.. So if you are looking for just a music player, I recommend a Zune HD, which is about $50 cheaper. However, if you are looking for a do-it-all device that will act as an mp3 player, gaming console, web browser, etc., then go with the iPod, because it can do all of these fairly well, with no specific strong points, other than gaming.. If you want my personal opinion, I would sign a contract and buy and Android phone instead, because it's eons ahead of iOS!. 

$$;
Pros:. HD camera and editing in my pocket anywhere I go. Great graphics and movies. The price is reasonable for the amount of computing capabilities. I replaced a laptop computer with an iPod touch. And it plays music.. 
Cons:. The video camera is only fair. The overall construction is poor compared to first generation iPods.. 
Summary:. I bought a first generation iPod touch several years ago. I got the 8 gig model, figuring it was a nice toy that I could listen to my music on and occasionally check my email. I immediately fell in love with the high quality device and used it daily. It survived many falls (Including three into the toilet though that did cause some issues.). I realized that I would soon need to buy a new Touch. My old one was having battery issues and I felt like I could not live without it. So I bought a 32 gig 4th gen iPod touch. I loved it. The camera was wonderful even though it is only basic point and shoot. As a professional video editor, I found iMovie fun to use and though it is limited, it really has all of the basics to put together a nice looking video. I was able to put together a short, HD family outing video in iMovie and upload it to mobile me in less than 20 minutes. That is very impressive from a device that fits in my pocket. My only complaint is the construction. The thin size of the iPod touch makes it difficult to hold, and while I was trying to slide it into the camera case I carry it in, it slipped from my fingers and hit the sidewalk. This bent the pressed steel case and shattered the glass. This was a fall that my 1st generation iPod would not have noticed due to the aluminum frame around it's glass screen. I was very happy with Apple's customer care and service people at the local Apple store.. All in all this is a great device. It is perfect for vacations, the family get together and other outdoor or brightly lit casual video shoots. It is great for checking email, playing games and reading books. I watch movies and tv shows with it on my television using an optional component cable. oh and it plays music too.. If you buy one, make sure you do not leave the store without a shock absorbing case for it. (At the time of this writing none were available from the Apple store so you might want to wait a couple of weeks.). 

$$;
Pros:. Touchscreen. 
Cons:. Lack of FM. 
Summary:. Base would be better @ 16 GB, improve the camera and get FM Radio. (without an extra Charge). 

$$;
Pros:. Everything you know and love about the touch, minus the durability.. 
Cons:. Not durable... at all.. Poor camera quality.. 
Summary:. Do not assume that this ipod lives up to previous experiences with apple ipod touches or phones when it comes to durability. It is crucial to buy a case for this device, even though none are currently offered. My ipod touch dropped 18 inches on to tile after I sat down in a chair causing the corner to be significantly skewed and pull away from the screen. Until cases become available do not buy this device or only use it in a padded room.. Unless the new features (mainly facetime as the front facing camera is no good) are a must for you and you can wait until cases become available, just stick with the 3rd generation of this device.. 

$$;
Pros:. have a camera, great improvement on the processor. 
Cons:. non-IPS technology, Half the RAM of the iPhone, The screen is not the same, not even enough MP in the camera resolution and just too expensive for the lack of all this hardware 'improvements'. 
Summary:. I know I'll be comparing it with the iPhone a bit but you can't expect Steve Jobs to say "Is an iPod Touch just like an iPhone, But without the calling" Well it doesn't have the same hardware and that's how it fails.. It seem to be a waste of Processor power to have such low RAM. The screen is not the same, and at extrem angles it doesn't have the same resolution as the iPhone. I won't even go with the CAM, since it was mostly designed for video than anything else, pictures are just a byproduct of the video camera.. It's just too expensive for the parts it brings. New software will be available that will need a better for the device not to lag especially since it has multi-tasking features. if we need to compare it to another device , Its really a mini iPad. All in all, if you feel like you need an update this is definitely going to be an improvement, but its definitely not ground breaking device. Every year there will be an improvement on the line, it doesn?t have all the important hardware to make this an iconic Generation.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like everything about the ipod touch before I bought it. The idea of being able to go online, the app store, playing games, movies, etc. It's practically a mini computer what's not to love???. 
Cons:. The ipod touch has too many little operational glitches that they need to work out.. 
Summary:. The first ipod that I bought skipped every song and did not allow apps to be downloaded because of errors. After trying a million solutions included ripping all of my music again apple care sent me a replacement ipod. That to did the same thing. I also have an ipod nano that i synced with my music just to make sure it wasn't my computer sure enough it didn't skip at all on that device.. After 2 more replacements the 3th they sent would not upload the newest version of Itunes. After making it half way through the process the thing just died. I mean it wouldn't even turn on it was completely fried. They sent me another replacement. It did the same thing, so I went to the apple store with my computer and had them try. They fried 2 more ipods in the store (one on my computer and another on theirs) before they were able toget it updated and after 2 hours I was on my way. Then I tried to sync songs on it again. Finally it worked....however they ALL skip again. I was able to get the apps on it however i cannot not get them from sync them from itunes. This device has been nothing but a nightmare. I would advise you to try the nano instead and if you like the touch screen get the ipad maybe that would work better. If you do get the touch I really hope you have better luck than I did.. 

$$;
Pros:. I said wow wow wow quite a few times I must say. The ease of connecting to wifi hotspots and how it remembers is impressive.. The famous apple interface is flashy..... 
Cons:. I have had 2 iPod Touch 4g 64gb- returned em both because I charge it over night- and its dead by lunchtime. 2 weeks of aggravation and anxiety- and two separate units- same problem. Don't buy this til Apple fixes problem.. 
Summary:. I look on Apple's own Discussion Forums and see 200,000 plus other views on ipod touch 4g battery issues and another 100,000 on wifi never shutting off issues- relating to the 4g and the iOS4/4.1 being flawed.. So I am not alone. Lots of people hate the cheap cameras on the thing too. Apple left a bitter taste in my mouth. I paid cash money for my unit- $430.92 cents- they refused to refund me cash (Apple Store Walnut St. downtown Philly). I'm going into my fifth day with no media player and they promised to give me my money back via check in mail- 7-10 business days.. Wow- helluva first experience with this company- I think it will be my last.. Apple is iLame, iSlimy, - they still have my money after they have had their crappy product back going on 5 days now. this is unbelievable..
