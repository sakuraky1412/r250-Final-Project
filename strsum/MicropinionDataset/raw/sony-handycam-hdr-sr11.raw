Pros:. - VERY High quality. - Easy to use. - Easy to transfer videos from camcorder to PC. - Built in HD means you don't need to worry about tapes, or memory cards. 
Cons:. - No wind filter. - Can be a little grainy in poor lit areas. 
Summary:. I had been searching for an HD camcorder for a while, and looked at A LOT of different camcorders before I found the HDR-SR11 after reading several reviews I knew this was the camera I wanted, I ended up buying the HDR-SR12, however the only difference here is the size of the HD.. When I bought the camera I was ready to shoot as many videos as possible, the first couple of days I used shooting everything from the outside world to ultra close ups of salad heads. I must say I was very impressed with the quality that the videos were shot in, and this was before I realized that I wasn't even shooting in the highest quality range.. I would recommend this camera to everyone who can afford the rather expensive price, whether you want to use the camera for shooting the first steps of your new baby, or you want to shoot the amazing nature you live in, the HDR-SR11 has something for everyone.. And I have seen a lot of people complain about the missing Mini HDMI cable, honestly if you can afford the camera, then you can also afford the extra cash for the cable, besides the camera comes packed with all other cables.. 

$$;
Pros:. The video is nice and can be downloaded to my computer fairly easily. You can insert a memory stick to hold pictures if you do not want them on your hard drive. It's not too bulky and can be carried around all day.. 
Cons:. I did have to purchase another battery as a backup. There were a few times when I had run close to the end of the battery and wished there were more time left! I bought the camera and forgot I needed a big computer to hold all of these files!. 
Summary:. I purchased the camera about 10 months ago and it is simply a good product. The recording settings can be changed to make the picture as nice as you need. The higher the quality, the more hard drive space you will use up. I would make sure that you have a ton of space on your computer to transfer all of these files! I actually had to buy a computer with 640GB of drive space and I am adding another 1 TB hard drive to hold all the HD videos and pictures. I use Pinnacle Studio 12 to edit and create movies and have had no problems to date. The touch screen is easy to use and can be seen in the sunniest of places. Other than a bit of finger print cleaning, it is pretty straight forward.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quality is Incredible.. 
Cons:. Pricey..... 
Summary:. Perfect!. 

$$;
Pros:. to many to list!. 
Cons:. none, it does everything i can think of.... 
Summary:. This Camera is really beefed up. Lots of functions to grow into! out the box it is ready to capture your moments in pristine clarity. I caught a 5 day Disney vacation and didn't even put a dent in the 60gb. This is definately a safe purchase that you'll enjoy for years and years. 

$$;
Pros:. Impresive immage and sound quality. Decent photos (get a DSLR if you are really demanding). 
Cons:. I hate the touch screen!...as well as the mini HDMI socket.. The supplied software is a shame. It works perfect (thanks God), but just a few options.. 
Summary:. As I own an FX1 for professional purpose, I was very happy when this small HD camcorder had been released on the market. The quality of the immage in normal light conditions is better than FX1, but this ends when you'll shot in low light .. The sound is really impresive when you are listening using a home cinema 5.1 ch. system.. Over all I believe that this camcorder is all you may need for a holiday or for a private event. Be sure that you turned on some lights, before starting to shot indoor videos, or attach a cam light.. 

$$;
Pros:. Have a FullHD feature, more cheap compare to the partner HDR-SR12, the capacity is more than enough, the heavy is relative light, i can record the sound with 5.1 cool, the shape is nice and buttons functionality is good to manage.. 
Cons:. What the f!@#$ for Sony just give us Vegas Pro 8 , this software is crap , it can not play / convert the FullHD file (.mts) into AVI or MPEG . The last need to upgrage into Vegas Pro 9 for the solution .. 
Summary:. I like this product it's a good product , till now it doesn't has a problem with the hardware and functionility. The support also a lot in Singapore .. 

$$;
Pros:. The video was excellent, especially in bright lighting. The 5.1 surround audio was surprisingly good, when the camera holder speaks it is right in your head while the ambient noises and other voices are accurately placed in the soundfield.. 
Cons:. S-video or mini-HDMI output cables not included. Flexibility with resolution settings could be broader - no 720p setting. The software is adequate for file transfer and burning but not much else.. 
Summary:. The video was as good as expected. The colors were brilliant, even at low lighting the colors are accurate. Motion is smooth, even fast action is depicted without blurring or pixelating. The autofocus inspires faith and the face detection is exceptionally functional. The audio is astoundingly realistic and the 5.1 surround is superb. Videos taken outside will have you looking around your livingroom for the barking dogs and squealing kids - Kudos to SONY!. The photos are a little harsh but easily remedied with adjustments to the saturation and sharpness. With the excellent lens, the photos are on par with a low-level CCD camera.. The software is a piece of cake and very workable. It is so anemic but that makes it very simple to use. It transfers and allows you to burn DVD at HD or SD but HD DVDs can only be viewed at 480X640 so it's a waste of space. I was leery about the AVCHD format from reading some of the difficulties others had, but it's not that big of a deal. My computer I built for under $400 last year (3.1GHz AMD X2 dual core with 2GB RAM) handles them without breaking a sweat. It took a little over an hour to burn a 46min SD DVD from files recorded at the highest resolution. However, until I purchase a Blu-ray burner, the most satisfaction comes from playing straight from the camera via mini-HDMI - AWESOME!. The camera is so easy to use I was filming right out of the box. The few changes I wanted to make were self explanatory using the on-screen menu. Once I set the settings I wanted, I hardly touch them now. For most family videos, this camera is almost too good to be true and it's fun even for those of us who can;t leave well enough alone:).. It was between this camera and the Canon HG20. I haven't used the Canon, but I don't really care anymor. This SONY make it a moot point, I'm thrilled with it..

Pros:. EXCELLENT IMAGE QUALITY, SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE AND EDIT, GREAT VIEWFINDER AND THE BEST LCD, VERY GOOD ZOOM MICROPHONE WITH 5.1 CH AUDIO RECORDING. VERY GOOD FULL MANUAL.. 
Cons:. NO WIND FILTERING, TOO GLOSSY "INTERFACE", INKL. LCD - MANY DACTYLS NEEDS TO BE REGULARLY CLEANED.POOR SW INCLUDED. NO MANUAL SHUTTER SPEED REGULATION.. 
Summary:. I OWN THE SONY HDR-SR 11 FROM THE END OF AUGUST 08.SO I WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN I AFTER 8 YEARS IN 2000 OVERPASSED FROM 3 VHS-C CAMCORDERS TO MINI-DV, NOW I�M VERY SATISFIED WITH THE GREAT AND CLEAR, FULL REALLY COLOURED IMAGE QUALITY IN FULL HD. I USE SONY TOO VIDEOLIGHT, EXTERNAL MICROPHONE FOR INTERVIEWS ETC. AND WIDELENS.I CAN RECOMMEND TO EDIT VIDEO FROM THIS GREAT CAMCORDER IN PINNACLE STUDIO 12 ULTIMATE, INCL. LAST UPDATE PATCH. FOR PREVIEW OF VIDEOS FROM HDR-SR 11 AND EDITING I USE 24" FULL HD LCD WITH HDMI INPUT, PC WITH N-VIDIA GE FORCE 8600 GTS WITH 512 RAM (INCL.HDMI CABEL-I BOUGHT ONLY ADAPTER FOR MINI-HDMI), INTEL QUAD CORE Q 6600, 4 GB RAM AND 2 TB HDD. IN SO ONE COMBINATIONS WITH PC HW AND SONYS� ACCESSORIES YOU CAN REACH REALLY GREAT VIDEOS. AFTER MY WORKING WITH 4 FORMERLY CAMCORDERS FROM THE YEAR 1992 I MUST SAY TO SONY: THANK YOU AGAIN ! ALL WISHES FULLFILED.. 

$$;
Pros:. This has got to be by far the best camcorder I have ever used! I am going into the field of videography and this camera's video quality is absolutely incredible! I could not believe how goo this camera has done! The HD video is awesome!. 
Cons:. I have nothing!. 
Summary:. Buy this camera! Without a doubt just buy it! You cannot be dissapointed when looking at the video quality! If you want to be able to shoot more then get the HRD-SR12! Ether one is amazing! Also check out the accessories that sony offers! I got the boom mic and shot a wedding and it worked out awesome! Client was amazed with quality of the footage!. 

$$;
Pros:. 1/3" CMOS Imager. 10 MP Still camera with flash. Mic input. Headphone Jack. Remote control (similar to LANC) available. Optical Image Stabilizer. Assignable Manual Button/Knob (used for focus, exposure, etc...). Super Slo-Motion. Memory Stick expandable. 
Cons:. No Time Lapse. Wish it used something other than memory stick (like SD or SxS). 
Summary:. I got this camera after much research - I know they no longer sell it but if you can get this (or it's 120GB big brother the SR12) go for it. For the money, IMHO there is no better consumer camera - It is so good, it borders on the prosumer line (based on features and final product).. 

$$;
Pros:. great hd video and sound. nice one touch dvd creation. nice hard drive. takes good still photos. nice compact camcorder.. 
Cons:. software is very limited. wind noise.. 
Summary:. the camcorder takes great hd video &#38; wonderful sound. I love having the hard drive that way I don't need to carry all those dvds, tapes, or even memory cards. the software is very limited is resources. the software has problem converting hd video to standard video to create a dvd. all in all this is a great camcorder.. 

$$;
Pros:. The quality of HD picture. 
Cons:. The microphone pichs up too much noise such as wind. 
Summary:. I have this camacorder since two days. It works perfectly well, especially on a Mac, where the free iLife, containing iMovie 08, is perfectly up to the job for editing footage.. I think I will have to buy a small tripod and a microphone effective against wind noise.. Updated. on Nov 10, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. No tapes needed, HD format. 
Cons:. add-on lenses disables built-in flash. 
Summary:. For the sake of capturing home videos of the family, this is a great camcorder. Since I had to replace my miniDV cam, this is definitely more than I really need, but at least I have the option to go HD now. All the controls are easy enough to figure out. The touch screen is simple to use. The camcorder itself has a nice solid feel to it with sturdy access doors. Best of all no more master tapes stacking up on my shelves. Overall I'm very pleased with using this camcorder. As an amateur, the picture and color quality are acceptable to my tastes. The still photos are also acceptable. When it comes to motion vs stills, my thoughts are: a camcorder is technologically designed specifically for motion and a digital photo camera for stills, try not to expect them to outperform each other.. One little quirk I've noticed so far is that when you attach any conversion lense, the lense will trip a sensor that disables the built-in flash. This makes sense if you were adding on a wide-angle lense which would block the flash, but not when it's something so simple as a UV lense. Of course that's only significant when I'm taking stills, but it would be nice if there was a manual flash control located on the body for quick changes.. Updated. on Sep 20, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, picture/sound/photo quality, price, ease of use, HDD size, easy to connect to PC.. 
Cons:. Absolutely none!. 
Summary:. I have been buying camcorders since 1990 and know quite a bit about videos and camcorders. First of all, you can't get any better then Sony. Secondly, this is by far the best camcorder to date. I was blown away by the picture quality. I tried all the settings, from Standard Definition (on lowest quality), to High Definition (set on it's highest quality) and the picture was incredible on every setting. Cool 5.1 surround sound even made it better. The camera fits ever so nicely in my hand, very light, touch screen is a pleasure to use. Not having to switch video tapes makes video capturing pleasant. Everything stored on a large hard drive and downloaded to a PC with only a USB cable is a dream. I love it!. As far as using it for still shots, the 10.2 mega pixels makes for incredible images. The build in flash and options makes shooting a breeze.. Even for $1000, I found the price not too bad considering what kind of camera you are getting. It's well worth it.. By far, the best camera I have used!. 

$$;
Pros:. Video &#38; photos are amazing. 
Cons:. Battery life, remote control a bit useless, not much available for AVHCD software. 
Summary:. Making the decision to purchase a high-definition camcorder today can be very difficult considering the great number of choice to we consumers today. I had narrowed my search to three manufacturers, Canon, JVC and Sony, mainly because I had prior camcorder experience with all three. Preparing to part with $1,000 on a want and not a need is very difficult. Even at the store I found it difficult making a final decision after extensive research.. I settled on the Sony HDR-SR11 because of the features and, primarily, the 60GB hard drive, as well as having the option to use Memory Stick DUO Media cards. Having those options makes the camcorder flexible. I can hook the camera into my computer through the USB slot, or I can remove the media card and pop it into the card reader on my computer, or the memory card reader on my TV, as it is a Sony product that accepts the Memory Stick.. Another area where the Sony has allowed added flexibility is in the number of quality settings from which one can choose. The highest quality records in full 1920 x 1080i. This permits you to save up to 7 hours &#38; 10 minutes worth of video on the hard drive. Plenty of time for me, but for those who need more, standard definition settings are available to allow up to 41 hours of recording time.. The high-definition movies are stunning! Very rich in detail and bold in color. It truly is a case where watching the movies are almost better than being there. For fun, I connected the SR11 to the TV via the included composite cable, and connected a JVC GR-D22U MiniDV through the firewire port. I put the TV on split-screen, and there was absolutely no comparison in the quality. The Sony blew this SD camera away. With the Sony, I could see every bubble in our swimming pool, every drop of water on the kids faces. With the JVC, I could tell the water was blue and that the kids were wet.. Not only are the videos great, the photos are just as rich. Sony claims 10.2 megapixel resolution. Considering that 10MP cameras can cost $400-$500 on their own, it is a feature that adds even more value to this camcorder. You can take take photos and records at the same time. Other nice touches are the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround recording. There isn't a windscreen on the microphone, so a slight breeze can become annoying, but beyond that, the sound is quite good.. The LCD screen is a 3.2" touchpanel with widescreen format. As it has 921k pixels, it's looking at a mini 720p HDTV. I like the touchscreen, but I have to wipe it down after each use. Looking through the regular viewfinder is kind of dull, small, and not very clear. Kind of a disappointment.. A docking station and remote control are included. You can attach the camera to the station to charge the battery, and it also contains the high definition component connection as well as a USB output. Surprisingly, there is no firewire output considering Sony has been a champion of the i.Link interface.. On the camcorder there is a mini-HDMI output, though Sony does not include the cable. S-Video and composite outputs are available also, and Sony does include that cable. For inputs, you can attach a separate microphone and there is a "shoe" available for adding lighting equipment.. There are a host of additional features and specifications I could include in my review, but you can read about those on Sony's website. I will mention one final cool thing. The night vision setting is great in a pitch black area. Yes, the images are green, but the infrared capabilities are really good. It's like watching an episode of "Ghosthunters".. Now that I've written of all the good things, I have to write of the mediocre. This camera records in the AVCHD format. This makes it great for transferring video to your computer in no time, but there isn't much available in the way of software. Also, as with any high definition media, unless you have a Blue-ray player, you can not view your finished video in high-def format on a DVD player. They will be in high-def from the camera to the TV, and you can transfer AVCHD to DVD, but it will not be high definition. I have to say though, it's still great.. I have not had the opportunity to see videos from what would be considered prosumer HD camera, costing $2,000 - $5,000, but based on what I see from this camcorder, they can't be much better.. 

$$;
Pros:. lightweight, small. 
Cons:. weight and size trade-off: cheap plastic body. 
Summary:. i really like the camera so far. It's lightweight and and takes awesome footage. the battery it came with has about a 1.5 hours on a full charge (npf-h50). I also got the ACCFH70 kit and that battery has about 3 hours on it. When I got the camera from sony, they had a great deal on the npf-h100...that beast has over 6 hours (with the lcd screen!). the only "bad" thing i can say about the camera so far is that i am so afraid dropping the camera and breaking it to bits...i know the plastic is light but my canon sd700IS is like a tank compared to the sr11. Anyway, get at least the 2 year service plan from sony...its only an extra $99. what i like about this camera is that it can easily be accessorized. I will be getting married in guam this november, and our honeymoon will be in bohol...i will be getting the waterresistant encasement for this camera and adding another review when we get back!.

Pros:. Shooting Still while shooting videos;Still Photo Capture; CAM CTL; HD quality. 
Cons:. Battery Life;. 
Summary:. I am amazed at this handycam. Taking still while shooting video; Still image capture in its own mode. Video quality and image quality are exceptional. I wanted the SR-12 but had to settle for SR-11 since these cameras are selling like hotcakes and SR-12 was out of stock. Sony has a winner on their hand. I wish the included battery could run longer. I am extremely satisfied with this Handycam.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture is magnificent. I use 57" DLP, and connected the cam to my PS3 slot. It took a little experimenting, but it was almost like being there. It was so real, both the video and pictures.. 
Cons:. The lack of an HDMI connection. Some colors, like red, are too red. And the cost. But I hope to use this cam for at least 5 yrs.. 
Summary:. If I had a top of the line desktop computer, with top of the line video software, and wanted a top of the line camcorder, I think this would be my pick, or the SR12. It takes some reading, and some practice, but within a few hours you would be looking like a professional camera person.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extreme ease of working with video on hard drive. Image quality. Build quality. Sound Quality.. 
Cons:. Battery life is short. More manual controls.. 
Summary:. I was interested in getting a semi-pro camcorder for producing a presentation and web video, and I had settled on the Sony HVR-A1U, which is has a single CMOS sensor and records in the HDV format on Mini DV cassettes. I liked it because it had XLR mic inputs with phantom power to attach high quality condenser microphones. However, I had really grown weary of the workflow with MiniDV tapes. Not knowing what is on them, winding and rewinding, the time it takes to capture, and the HVR-A1U is bottom loading so you have to take it off the tripod to load it.. So when I saw the HDR-SR11 with a hard drive, I was very attracted to it. I know that the AVCHD is not quite as good as HDV (more compression=lower image quality, requires more powerful hardware to edit, etc), but this camera has a higher data rate than previous AVCHD camcorders (similar to the Canon HF-10) and had pretty good reviews for image quality.. After using this for awhile, it will be very difficult to go back to a tape workflow. It is a joy to manage your shots on this camera compared to working with MiniDV. Each clip has a thumbnail, and it's all sorted by date (Try finding anything on a tape). And transferring to computer is much faster than capture is with MiniDV.. I fixed the microphone problem by purchasing a Beachtek DXA-6 box, which allows connection of XLR condenser mics which require phantom power. I hooked up my AKG Perception 220 condenser mic and the sound is now insanely great. (this camera does have a decent built-in mic, but you really can't compare). I already have Sony Vegas 7 Pro, which handles AVCHD, but my current system, relatively powerful (3.4GHZ Hyperthreaded Pentium, 3GB Ram, 2 drive Raid), which is a couple of years old, can't really play it smoothly. But I have been able to successfully do some editing.. I bought the NP-FH100 battery, and the camera is telling me I've got 6 hours of recording time! I haven't yet had time to test this out to see if it's true.. The image quality is indeed very good, certainly more than adequate for what I will be using it for.. All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase.. All in all, I'm very. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing video quality. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. Face detection not perfect. 
Summary:. I bought the SR12 model and really love it. I'm not one to post my opinion but I'm blown away at the quality and ease of use. The face detection is ok. In a large crowd with varying depths i.e. church choir, the face detection constantly adjusts the focus on people's faces. I was interested in only one person but that person would focus in and out, so I turned it off. I brought the camera on vacation and showed diifferent types of video on a 52 inch 1080p LCD. The videos I showed included kids playing on the beach, people surfing, sporting events, indoors and out. Every guy there was sold and said they are going to buy one as soon as they get home. They couldn't believe that such a little camera could produce such an amazing image. I also like the software that comes with the unit. It's easy to use and a nice addition to the video editing software I use.. Thanks Sony!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, Great vids and software, great construction. 
Cons:. Uses up battery fast especially when using blue tooth microhpone, eats up hard drive space on the computer, limited audio recording controls. 
Summary:. Its a great camera. It saves time because there uploading is fast and easy. But be ready to buy an external hard drive and blank DVD's. It's good practice to burn what you have recorded, otherwise you will find 500Gig of your hard drive space go fast. If you buy this, its a good idea to invest in the battery early. Stills are good but I like my the quality in my old Nikon Coolpix 5700. I especially like the feature where you can take stills while taking shooting vids. Face detection works very well. I also like the hybrid Memory card-Hard Drive design. Excellent camera! 60Gig is enough for me because I upload immediately after each event. It might matter though when you are traveling for an extended period. In that case invest on the sr12. The doors are well thought of. Sliding the Ai shoe door and lifting the eyepiece up while the Ai door is open shows attention to the design. Oh, one big drawback... when shooting using the power chord, don't just pull it out. You need to pause the camera and shut it off first then unplug the power. It doesn't let you switch to battery power while shooting or in standby.. Updated. on Nov 13, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to control. 
Cons:. quite heavy.... 

$$;
Pros:. very good recording performances. 
Cons:. camcorder capacity is limited by its file system capacity. 
Summary:. I own the SR12e. Please note that the amount of clips you record depend not only your hard disk space but the camcorder capacity is limited by its file system capacity. The file system capacity is set to be somewhere at the 4000.. I could not record more than 4000 clips even that I still have 1200 minutes free to record. &#38;#8230;.and yes, this error grabbed me in the middle of my holiday.. 

$$;
Pros:. High quality video and image, lightweight. 
Cons:. LCD is fingerprint prone, controls are hard to learn. 
Summary:. I actually have the SR12, which is only different by having more disk space - otherwise it is the same camera. It replaced an old Sony 8MM camera. What a WORLD of difference. Video is awesome, photos are great, even while taking video. The AVHCD works perfectly with iMovie on my iMac. Couldn't be happier. My only complaint is that the controls are way too complicated for many technical tasks, and there is too much "depth" to the menu system - hard to navigate. But otherwise, it's a great purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD, film quality, stills. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. I came from the frame of mind that I couldn't deal with mini DV tapes anymore and have been eyeing AVCHD camcorders for about 9mos now. I was going to Sony SR7 but I thought I should wait. And, a glad thing that I did -- this camcorder is stunning. It's easy to use -- my wife was up and shooting without any directions. Transfer of files (atleast for Mac users) is a snap (YOU NEED AN INTEL MAC THOUGH.). It's like watching home movie footage in hi-def. It's mind-blowing, full 1920x1080 (1080i) videos. Just need to hire a director to help me with car chases and explosions.... Buy it from a place with a liberal return policy in case it's not to your liking.. Also, one thing to note, what's up with the video reviewer? This is such an exciting product and Sir Sleepy is reviewing it, and even incorrectly. He was talking about Face Detection and hit another key (I think focus).. Good luck.. 

$$;
Pros:. 10.2 Megapixel Stills. 12X Zoom.. 
Cons:. No HDMI Cable. AVCHD Format.. 
Summary:. This is a great camcorder. If I were to go back and choose another I would get the SR12 due to its larger hard drive. This thing is fun and easy to use and captures excelent video quality. Also if you wanted you can upgrade the lense for $100.00. They make a wide angle and a telephoto lense. I like the fact that this records directly to a hard drive it makes it much easier to edit. But you need a powerful computer to edit this format. My desktop is about 2 years old and kind of struggles in editing this format, I use my Alienware laptop for editing and it does great. The software that comes with camcordr is easy to use but not much you can do with it therefore I use Pinnacle Ultimate and its great. I guess that the jist of it, great product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent HD or STD video, ease of operation, great stills, easy to carry around! 5.1 DD, See below for full details.. 
Cons:. No wind filter, proprietary software, not true 1080p, factory battery short life, no HDMI cable w/purchase.. 
Summary:. Spectacular camera! Replacing 10 yr. old Sony MiniDV camera that finally took a dive. Placed this on backorder after researching HD camcorders for months. Recently took a trip to Branson Missouri and was amazed with picture quality. Went to a tobyMac concert took pictures. Great quality at 10.2 MP, easy to use even my wife can navigate which was important to the purchase. The ease of operation is amazing between movie and picture with a simple thumb move on the control. Patience has paid off  if you have more patience than me, you might wait for a slight price drop, which I am sure will happen in the months to come.. The Pros: Hard drive has a lot of space even with HD. 60GB is a lot. 120 on the SR12 is nice, but I have already taped hours on the 60GB with plenty of space. If you are one to procrastinate on transferring data, 120 might be the way to go. I went ahead and bought the 4GB Pro Duo card in lieu of the HDMI cable. Money spent either way and its easy to transfer the pictures or video to the Duo and put into the PS3. Conversion is simple and unbelievable. You can convert to standard DVD which is nice to play in the car for the kids to watch on long trips since its not AVCHD compatible. However, you can create both standard DVD-Video or the HD AVCHD which plays on PS3s or Blu-Ray players and transfer to a DVD. The camera fits perfect in my hands, almost the size of a larger digital camera. The touch screen took a little getting use too, but once you start navigating it becomes easier. The engineers got it right for the consumer on this one! Hot shoe available for an external flash. The quick on feature so you dont continuously turn on and off, but save battery power. 5.1 Dolby Digital! Face detection! Slightly time consuming on conversion to DVD, but well worth the wait. You can format picture size between 4:3 to 16:9. The features are endless and spot on for people to learn quickly at ease.. The Cons: the proprietary software (Sony needs to expand a little in this category with options on menus, etc.). The price, obviously ahead of the game on technology you will pay premium. HDMI cable not provided, but the card is nice. I was told by Sony tech support when researching cameras this was a 1080p and it is not. Windy situations picks up sound when taping, needs a wind filter. Be cautious at loud concerts, the microphone is sensitive and I was at a loud Christian concert where it sounds baffled. Could be I was 5 rows from the front stage though! Battery life is short on the battery provided, however, Im a believer to have an extra one handy and the NP-FH70 is a good purchase that lasted much longer than I expected  145 minutes or so. Overall, the SR11 is an excellent choice for HD fanatics! Im addicted and only owned it for a short period of time. Friends are in awe of the picture quality and envious! Although, my goal was to replace an old camera that failed on me. This purchase by far was worth the money. The conversion to DVD was so easy, but be patient. The quality from HD to Dolby Digital and still pictures is phenomenal. I keep telling myself to not purchase Sony for several reasons and experience over the years (i.e., tech support, repair-terrible), but I end back with the purchase because of the cutting technology in the product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Digital stills at 10.2 MP, Easy to use, Basically Plug and Play, Software that came with the camera allows auto conversion to publish to YouTube and other popular sites. Great!. 
Cons:. Size of Hard drive, wish I had gottn the SR-12! Same camera just a bigger hard drive.. 
Summary:. I have had a mini DV for a number of years and this is light years better. I cannot believe the ease of use and the easy conversion to a standard def. DVD. I will be getting a blue ray player because this camcorder is unbelievable for the amateur family videographer. I was very nervous about the price, but now that I have used it I am so happy with the performance. No more tapes and mini DVD's sitting around! Love the camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD video, Still photo quality, Easy to handle and control. 
Cons:. Sound quality is absolutely abysmal. No firewire. Not much in software.. 
Summary:. A friend and I used it in front of a green screen in both HD and SD. While the quality in SD turned out a little fuzzy, the HD video turned out great.. The microphone is not the problem with the camera, it's the audio processor. Using an internal, external, or Sony's hot shoe, the sound is always squashed to one level. There is no switch to turn the compressor off or to adjust the input beyond hi or low. Picking up sounds of a person or two talking is fine, but to record your kids recital or musical is pointless without a standalone audio recorder.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is excellent. Kids football and baseball is unbelieveable.. 
Cons:. Very small size is great but be prepared for camera movement if you so much as blink. Get a good tripod and home movies will be more enjoyable. This is my fifth Sony video camera and the best by far.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture in movie mode, good view finder, excellent display, sufficient sound, good and relatively easy to handle (to record), HDMI (and can be controlled through my Samsung TV), Software sufficient. 
Cons:. Still Picture not so impressive (oversharpened), difficult to handle in playback mode, Volume control only through menu, some settings cannot be reached via remote, no HDMI on docking station, relatively short battery life. 
Summary:. I like my camera. It is definitively better than what I expected in terms of video quality. In daily operations, there are quite a number of things that you'd like to get changed - still it doesn't make it a bad camera. I would like to see some setting to use the ext. mic jack just for center sound, rather than switching off the internal mike. This would allow to use a radio microphone for a good sound of the person talking and still retain the ambient sound. It owuld be nice to have a car adapter, i.e. to charge your camera in the car. I purchased an inverter and use the AC power supply to charge. It would be great to have a second power supply that you could leave with the docking station. It would be great if there was some conversion software to allow editing your video in "any" software and convert it back to import back into the camera. I purchased Vegas Movie Studio, which allows editing and converting, but it doesn't convert back. That is available in a more expensive edition of the software. I still like my camera! It offers many things and seduces to do mor ewith it, which is when you run into limitations.. I highly recommend purchasing an additional battery (possibly with higher capacity), a wide angle lens might com in handy. The optical zoom was alway sufficient for my purpose, even at a 2x digital zoom, picture quality is still nice, however, sometimes things come too close. A neck strap definitively helps me not being too worried about the camera dropping for not holding it firm enough. You need a mini HDMI cable so you can enjoy in case you have no component jacks on your TV (as on my secondary).. Overall, a great camera, I recommend to all my friends who want HD movies. count in the extra money for the accessories I mentioned and you'll be very happy!. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the fact that it has a hard Drive, for 2 reasons, 1- You don't really have to worry about running out of space, and 2- It helps to grip the camera. Slow motion, night vision is nice too.. 
Cons:. Low Battery life, because of the hard drive, keep a spare or more, if you plan to do a lot of recording.. 
Summary:. A great camcorder, easy menu, a must if you are looking for a HD consumer camcorder able to record for hours at a time, and a ton of accessories are available for this camcorder as well. Mini hd -standard Hd plug was 9.99 on ebay.. 

$$;
Pros:. most everything. 
Cons:. zero Fade Effects. 
Summary:. I just bought this camera and have been educating myself on how to use it for an upcoming trip. I have one "con" before I even start. Why is it my 10 year old JVC camcorder has more numerous Fader Effects than can be listed here, while my NEW THOUSAND DOLLAR "SOTA" HD Camcorder only offers a solid Black or White Fade? C'mon Sony! How is my Artistic Expression/Creativity gonna show? It's enough to make me return it.. 

$$;
Pros:. High end picture. 
Cons:. Bad wind noise, no filtering. 
Summary:. Ok, now I spent $1,200 for this camera, I had to convince my wife that we need to move up another notch. OK, back from Tahiti, Bora Bora and cross country, drive is full, did my backup onto my hard drive, now what, nothing to transfer this high end HD video to, no recorders out there to record all my video, no blue ray recorders that are affordable and Best Buy or Circuit City has no clue how to transfer the HD, Sony does not reply emails on this subject.... well it will sit in my drive till one day I will be able to watch my HD movies.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought this two days before our Spain vacation. We were using it day and night and it performed beautifully! Very intuitive to use and easily switch between video and the 10 megapixel camera (wife used up her camera's three memory sticks).. 
Cons:. The camera doesn't come with software for the iMac. But simply pluggiing it in via USB or Firewire loads it up into iMovie; yo ujust don't get Sony's interface software for a Mac -- (Could be a good thing, maybe?!).. 
Summary:. The hi-def mode videos are superb and the camera is light enough to carry around anywhere. I especially wanted the hard-drive because I was sick of having to shell out $5+ for each Mini-DV tape and then having to remember to put a sticker on it to remind ourselves of what was on it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Brilliant quality, easy to use for beginers, but still retains depth for experts,. 
Cons:. having to Work with AVCHD. 
Summary:. Overall its excelent, the camera looks sleak, it feels sleak and your movies look....sleak!. Really easy to use for begineers, but has enough depth for those who like to fiddle settings for perfection.. The Still Camera I was very dissapointed in and it comes nowhere near my Cannon ixus75 ( which was about �150).. The touch screen needs a firm push for it to respond, and the menu system can at times be a little frustrating to navigate. The only touch screens I have ever really come to like is the iphone or the TomTom.. The SR11 is marginaly better then sony's SatNav screens.. 

$$;
Pros:. love the HDD convenience, 3.2 " LCD, HD video quality, color rendition, port doors. 
Cons:. some blurring unless you pan VERY slowly. 
Summary:. I did a lot of research before buying this camcorder and I believe if you want an HDD AVCHD this is the way to go, no better video quality in this format right now. Be aware though, if you move this camera to fast from side to side you will get blurring indoors and out regarless of lighting conditions. Mini DV, while on the way out, still exhibits best video characterists but AVCHD is catching up.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clarity of video and photos. Good low light performance. 
Cons:. Touch screen controls. No shoulder/neck strip, HDMI connector or FULL users manual provided in package. Proprietary battery provided has small capacity. Recommended altitude limitation of only 3000 m. 
Summary:. After having many different Canon Camcorders, I finally bought my first Sony because of it's clearly superior HD imagery and excellent still images. The lens on this camera is outstanding. The sound pick up is also excellent without an external microphone. While a wind filter is desirable if it detracts from the current quality sound, I can live without it.. I usually use the viewfinder and not the LCD screen for shooting my videos and the lack of an exension to the viewfinder when using it with even the small battery is an inconvenience and more difficult with a large capacity battery.. Sony should definitely provide a shoulder/neck strap with this and every camcorder. I often carry my camcorder with a DSLR or point and shoot still camera. In fact, I'm using a Canon neck srap with this camera as I could not find a suitable one for sale.. I'm very concerned about the low level altitude restriction of only 3000 meters (9800 feet) since I routinely shoot video and photos in Colorado above that level. They also have a narrow 50-86 degree farenheit temperature recommendation. If, in fact, operation outside of these ranges is not possible I will rank this camera much lower. We spent January in South America and Antarctica and my Canon cameras worked fine at temperatures down to 10 degrees F. The Canon stated operating conditions are 32-104 F and no limitation noted on altitude. Canon also provides a Full printed manual and not just a softward .pdf download.. I dislike the SONY touch screen and much prefer using a joy stick and not having to open the LCD display for practically all actions; however, I'm getting used to this limitation. The one touch knob control on front of camera is useful for fine tuning the focus (or any other single function you may desire). My wife likes the "Easy" record function provided and we took great video and photos on our first weekend with the camera at a zoo and on the beach. I loaded the Sony software but don't use any of it as I find my existing Photo Organizers and ULead Video Studio 11.5 software to be superior.. DO NOT but an HDMI cable for this camera at BEST BUY unless you want to waste your mony. You can get one for $10 on line that works fine as opposed to the Best Buy over $100 offering.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video quality is great, Camera function works well - didn't expect to use it but it works well and the flash is very bright!. 
Cons:. one major problem for me, when importing into Final Cut Pro the time code doesn't reflect time of day or any sort of time. just shows a start time of 00:00:00:00 and the end time code is however long that clip is.. I hope (doubt) Sony sends an update. 
Summary:. Great camera for an amateur/family as long as you're not accustomed to pro level equipment. Even a consumer camera with miniDV has a time code..... 

$$;
Pros:. Photo and excellet. 
Cons:. Boxed software is useless. Third party software needs work. 
Summary:. An excellent cam, easy to learn. great picture quality.. Howver playing AVCHD files on a PC is very difficult, the software support for the native format has a long way to go.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice HD picture - looks great on my TV's in the high resolution modes, and in the lower modes too.. "good" quality still photos with same small form factor camera.. Easy to use, generally intuitive menus for basic tasks.. 
Cons:. Software that ships with camera is almost useless. No ability to edit at all and hence the camera is almost useless too.. For $500 additional you can get Sony Vegas Pro software - complicated but works. The cheaper software at around $100 is crippled. 
Summary:. At current $1650 price for the camera and $500 for decent software, it isn't worth it its price. I paid less -- $1200 for the camera - and feel like that turned out to be a poor value. The camera is pretty good, works,Takes nice stills, nice video provided you just want to plug directly into a HDTV and never edit.. With a temp software trial, I was able to edit 1 important item. Learning curve on the software is pretty high for any sophisticated editiing. Video processing is very SLOOOOOW even on the fastest Quad processor PC's. Software support sucks and is way overpriced, as is the camera. Do yourself a favor and buy a $400 camera that is not HD and can dump files direct for web publishing. You'll use it far more. Overall value was poor when I bought it and is now worse for new buyers as the price of the camera has risen substantially. Do not waste your money on this overpriced gadget unless you want to pay over $2K to do basic video editing of your media, and have tons of time to perform that editing. Overall very poor value at the current price and terrible software support with the product as it ships.. 

$$;
Pros:. The hard drive.. 
Cons:. If it goes wrong you loose everything. 
Summary:. Can anyone help I have a sony dvd camcorder at the moment and am thinking of getting the sr11, the disadvantages to the dvd one is when I edit using hd pinnacle I seem to loose quality ,if i play the dvd straight from the camcorder the quality is excellent but after edditing it seems to be not as good.. I am wondering if the sr11 recordings are good even after edditing, if anyone can help me it would be much appreciated. 

$$;
Pros:. Image is crystal clear when the you use the handycam mounted on tripod or when you are study.. 
Cons:. Image clarity is not good while panning.. 
Summary:. I would say, not a worthy buy for the $'s you spend on this.. Image clarity is not good while panning. We need to be real slow while panning. Image Stabilization is not good while your subject is changes from near to far and vice-versa. We have this issue even when you try to take video while walking.. so you can forget about taking the video while you are driving in a car and etc. I have checked the same with few of my friends, who has this handycam.. its to make sure that my piece was not faulty one.. SR45,SR85,SR300 and etc doesn't have this prob.. I guess you need to compromise on this issue if you are interested to have HD quality image.. 

$$;
Pros:. Decent HD video quality.. 
Cons:. Touch screen when dead after just after one year of use (out of warranty). Video format is not widely support and very difficult to edit. Camera is bulky and craftsmanship is generally poor compared to competing products.. 
Summary:. When I bought this just over a year ago it was $1,200. I thought I was buying the best for my new born son. While the video it did produce was decent, it was incredibly difficult to edit and is pretty much worthless if you want to upload it to YouTube or edit and burn to a DVD, so don't bother with it if these are important to you (and if you have children, this will be important). The screen went dead just after this went out of warranty as well. This is very typical sony, their craftsmanship is notoriously bad, high price, poor quality product. I've had 5 laptops from them and three televisions, they've all had issues. I've been switching to other products little by little and I'm very very happy to say that I'm completely free of sony's diseased products, I've switched all the office laptops to Mac, our televisions to Samsungs and Sharps (both outstanding products) and finally this camera has gone into the garbage after a year (the quoted price to fix it from Sony was just under $1,000... they must have thought I was mentally retarded to accept that price). I bought a new Canon HD video camera, which is what I was going to buy in the first place, and I went against my better judgement. It's outstanding, I've been using it for two months now almost everyday and it's head and shoulders above every sony product I've ever used. Stay away from Sony, you may say that my opinion is tainted, and that may be true given my history with their products, but to have the touch screen completely fail after 1 year, just after the warranty was over and then have them quote me $1,000 to fix it... well you judge for yourself whether you'd want to get into a situation like that or just buy a brand that works.. 

$$;
Pros:. good video. 
Cons:. bad sound, no wind block. Hard drive broke easily with out the camera ever being dropped.. 
Summary:. warranty covers labor for first 90 days only. Parts for one year. Did not expect to have to pay $149 on a $1100 camcorder only 5 months later.. 

$$;
Pros:. HDD is of poor quality...sony does not care if you have a problem they will led you on until the parts warranty is gone. 
Cons:. You seem to have good fortune then when time to burn your dvd's the HDD goes down...better back up daily after use or after each event. 
Summary:. The onboard software is crappy, to many errors...the HDD is crappy, stores data only to crater when you try and copy...Sony must recall and replace all HDD's or refund everyone's money...I held this product with extreme caution and userability only to have the HDD crapout when trying to access for burning dvd on another sony product...the sony dvd recorder dvd/vhs which was supposed to be the greatest media compatibility for the high priced sr11 boy was I ever miss-informed Good Luck if you buy this product or have it written in the purchase contract for warranty on the HDD to be extended beyond 1 year...my HDD crapped out after less than 8 months use and only 42 files of precious family data all lost and no way to recover yet.... 

$$;
Pros:. There is nothing to recommend about this camera. 
Cons:. Hard drive failure. 
Summary:. Two months ago, I sprang for this much pricier camcorder than I normally would have because we were celebrating my husband's 50th birthday with our first vacation to Europe in 25 years. With the larger hard drive on this camera, it meant I didn't have to drag my laptop along for transferring the video.. In the middle of the trip, I tried to replay the video I had just taken, and I got a screen that read, "HDD format error." Nothing had happened to the camera -- I didn't drop it, there were no extremes of temperature, nothing knocked it. Mistakenly thinking that Sony was a stand-up company and would take care of this, I put the camera away for the rest of the trip and called Sony when I got home.. The news was not good. Sony reports that its warranty covers repairing the camera "to factory standards" but will not even attempt to recover the video.. Instead, Sony's customer relations recommended I try a third party hard drive recovery service. If all of the video is recovered, I will pay out of pocket about $1200-1400, on top of the $1200 I spent on the camera. Sony does not reimburse anything.. The customer relations representative was incapable of comprehending the bitter irony that Sony was willing to restore my camera to the very same "factory settings" that put my vacation memories at risk.. Unless you plan to back up each and every video clip as you take them, do not buy this camera. Do not assume that your experience will be any different.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks cool, great features.. 
Cons:. Lost footage.. 
Summary:. The bottom line is this camera is not reliable. It was used in recording my trip to Italy which was 10 days of some of the most amassing sights you could imagine. Until I went to review some footage before I started the trek back home.... Ooooops, Hd format error! EVERYTHING, GONE!!!. Sorry, we can recover your media for 1200 dollars.... 

$$;
Pros:. Big LCD screen. Reasonable zoom. 
Cons:. Slow to focus. Colours looked faded. Sharpness and details was average.. 
Summary:. Very disappointed in this camcorder.. The colours were faded and artificial when compared to other brands.. The details were lacking as well. There also seemed to be high levels of noise under low light recordings.. 

$$;
Pros:. Viewfinder. 3.5" LCD screen. 
Cons:. Basic software provided. No HD Blu Ray software, trial version only supplied.. Disappointed in Image quality under various lighting conditions,especially indoors (Noise). The colours look faded as well.. The 10M pixel stills don't look it.. 
Summary:. After reading alot of reviews I went to the retail store to see for myself. I compared side by side the SR11/12 with the Canons and the JVC HD30/40 in the retail store under various lighting conditions and connected them to identical LCD panels. All camcorders were set to their out of box settings along with the identical LCD screens. The results were amazing. The JVC left the Sony SR11/12 and the Canons for dead. The JVC GZ-HD30/40 had a better image, sharper details and the colours on the JVC looked better.Also the JVC was not as noisy as the others especially under low lights.. I ended up purchaseing the JVC HD40 and I'm extremely happy with it. My friend has a SR12 and he even agrees with me when we compared the two models side by side ourselves.I definatley recommend that you all do this and see for yourself.. 

$$;
Pros:. Still photos are great.. 
Cons:. The HD is unreliable, no way at all to rescue anything. One glitch ever - all gone.. 
Summary:. The camera uses odd formats - so the movies are difficult to manage (the Sony software is very poor) plus the HD cannot behave as a regular HD in windows - so if you have any problems all you can you is a) return it for warantee repair (and lose all data), b) sell it as faulty (see ebay - there are a few), c) pay to have it mended out of warantee and risk it all again. Fortunatey we backed up everything every day - but while filming one day it announced a buffer error - then E:31:00 and that was that - Borneo, SIngapore, Christening all gone forever (except for the backup). The point is with a 120gb drive - you can lose a HUGE amount of footage in one go. We filled about half the drive in six months (all backed up) - but you dont know if the drive is faulty until you get to the bad sector or whatever it was. And then as soon as you get to the faulty bit - poof! If you phone Sony they just look up "E" errors in the manual and say it has to be returned. The chap said "hmm were you using it outdoors?" - actually I wasn't so he said it might be the central heating. There are no rescue disc possibilities, no - norton disc doctor nothing one minute its working and next minute its a �700 paper weight. Even returning it is a hassle. You have to wait for them to post you a form to fill in to apply for a repair.The online repair request system does not work with these cameras for some reason.. I was just filming - nothing odd unusual or dangerous. Just standing holding the camera. I cant imagine its anything more than a corrupt file - like you may get on a PC from time to time - but there is absiolutely nothing you can do as an end user. A google search finds many others with the same problem - but no solution.. Its a lovely camera and the picture quality is superb but the quality of the drive is just not up to the job..
