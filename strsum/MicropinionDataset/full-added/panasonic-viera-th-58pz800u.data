i like the large , excellent picture (cable , bd , dvd , games) , attractive design , and configuration that allows it to be mounted on an extension arm  .
everyone wants to come over  .
58 size sounds large (and is) , but is not imposing .
killer plasma tv set at a bargain price  .
the picture quality is excellent  .
not as good as my brother's pioneer 60 inch elite kuro , but it's a third of the price  .
thx mode using warm and normal temps perfect with most viewing (follow the masters' setting in avs forum)  .
picture setting needs to be cranked up to 100 in thx mode  .
vivid mode is great for sporting events in bright light conditions  .
awesome set .
get it before they stop making them .
this is our first real big screen (replacing a 50 inch panny plasma) and the enjoyment and satisfaction from watching a screen this big with excellent picture quality acorss the board , is well worth it  .
and panasonics seem to be very well made and reliable (our 3rd panasonic plasma in the house  .
) tv is used as main tv in our family with 3 windows and a sliding door  .
the blinds do have to be drawn and yes , there is reflection on the screen  .
not to the point of distraction but is noticeable  .
still playing with cnet recommended settings and our own custom settings  .
buy this tv , you wo not be disappointed  .
(also have sony lcd in the house    but the panny plasmas all seem to have better picture quality) .
excellent tv , there are great deals to be had with this set  .
the picture quality is among the best period  .
i have yet to see better , pioneers included  .
but then again that is only my opinion , what do i know  .
i give it a 5 star for trying so hard to improve over the past few years  .
i think pioneer and panasonics are the best plasma brands .
i am a huge gamer  .
i have a 360 and ps3  .
videogames have a ton of motion and this set handles motion like a champ  .
i have spent hundreds of hours playing on lcd models and they don't even remotely stand up to this set  .
i could not possible recommend this tv more  .
i consider myself an expert with home theatre and i am very hard to please  .
this set lives up to the hype  .
cnet is exactly right , the only set that is better is the pioneer elite which is 5k  .
given the much lower price this is the best of the best  .
i honestly could not recommend this set more , it truly is perfect for those videophiles who are into gaming  .
the picture quality is like looking through a window .
hooked up to a panasonic br dmp    bd35 wow and i have not tried a blue ray on it yet  .
the upconversion of regular dvd's is excellent and looks great on this tv  .
i had a 4    year    old panasonic plasma and wanted to upgrade  .
panasonic has a deserved reputation for outstanding picture , which is my primary concern  .
after all , is not a good picture the reason one buys a plasma in the first place  .
after looking at competing brands , i found myself looking at panasonic as the gold standard to excellent viewing  .
now that i have this model , i must say there has been a quantum leap in quality in the past 4 years  .
oh yeah , it is 1/3rd the price of what i paid 4 years ago  .
i'm a very happy camper (and viewer) .
for the money , you cannot surpass a buy like this  .
and having not bought it through a web dealer , i am not concerned with panasonic giving me grief on the warranty  .
costco will make it good  .
beautiful lines and functionality  .
picture is exactly what i dreamed of having , and the sound is room    filling from the four speakers within the set  .
and the speakers are hidden  .
the set is wall mounted on a simplicity wall mount ($79  .
00 from costco)  .
the mount is very very sturdy and high strength  .
it is also a 12 degree tilt system  .
the manual is to    the    point and easy to read and understand  .
the remote is simplistic and functional as well  .
i enjoy the viera feature which links all of your equipment , even the scientific 8300 cable box .
first this is my fourth hd tv and my third plasma  .
i've had this panny for about three weeks now and absolutely love it  .
this tv is replacing a 50 vizio which in its on right had a very respectable picture  .
the vizio never failed to impress whenever i had company over even if my guest had other more expensive hd tvs of their own before i made this purchase i researched it long and hard  .
i liked the samsung but in the end it came down to panasonic and pioneer  .
i thought the elite had the best picture but the elite had an elite price  .
so then it came down to the 6020 and the 800u and the 850u  .
i chose the 800u over the 850ufor its thx mode which has earned excellent reviews from all the professional critics and i did not need vierra cast internet capabilities  .
when doing side by side comparisons between the 6020 and the 800u it is very close  .
both had subtle strengths and weaknesses  .
my viewing distance is about twelve feet  .
if my viewing distance were six to eight feet i might have chose the pioneer  .
ultimately i felt like the panasonic is a better value  .
i consider myself very picky about picture quality and i could have afforded the 6020 if i really wanted it  .
that being said the picture quality on the 800u really is that good  .
the initial settings out of the box are horrific  .
after i bit of tweaking and amateur calibrating this set continues to impress me and all my friends every time i turn it on  .
as it breaks in it does seem to get better and better  .
i have a ps3 and have not noticed any flicker on any of the br disc that i have watched  .
at any rate i would not let that be a deal breaker no matter what others ahve said beacause this tv produces some of the most fantastic images i have ever seen on any screen do not take my word for it , do your own research , go to the avs forum and do some reading  .
in the end you will realize that this 58 panny gives more bang for your buck than any other tv out there .
this set is incredible , i love it some people have misunderstood the single panel glass statement  .
let me explain , most plasmas have 2 sheets of glass in front of the glas on the plasma panel (so essentially 3 sheets) , this set only has a single sheet and instead of the second sheet in front there is a 1/4 thick frame around the outside , on other models this frame would continue across the the front as the second sheet of glass  .
the advantage to the single sheet is a reduction in ghosting at certain angles when the image reflects off of the back of the front sheet and back on to the front of the second sheet , there is also a very noticeable reduction in weight over last years model my main concern is with the 48hz flicker issue , i have had 3 conversations with panasonic so far , they are looking into the issue and have told me they will get back to me shortly , hopefully with some sort of a fix  .
this really is my only complaint with the set , it is a stunning plasma for the price , probably the best value for the money in a 58 by anyone  .
yes the pioneer kuros has slightly better blacks (i'm talking maybe 7 or 8 % better) , but not enough better to justify the price difference  .
as far as the flicker issue goes just run it in the 60hz mode since i can see no major issues with image smoothness in 60hz mode , i just find it odd that they sent it to market with a feature that is virtually unusable .
a tiny correction  .
this 58 does not have the one sheet of glass look of its smaller siblings  .
the bezel is in fact raised a 1/4 from the screen the brightness of the picture can be greatly increased if you do not use the thx mode , which is noted in the review  .
i've been switching between thx (with the picture setting turned up) and a custom setting with more pop  .
nine times out of ten the thx is better  .
this set is certainly bright enough for anyone glare    not a problem for me  .
i had my sony 35 crt tv next to this set for a day  .
they both reflected about the same amount of room light updated  .
on jan 7 , 2009  .
i bought this tv just before the new 2009 models came out because it had finally dropped in price enough to justify buying it  .
boy am i happy that i did  .
i love everything about this tv my only regret , that i will always have with anything , is that the 2009 models and now even the 2010 models have even more/better features added that i would love to have  .
i had waited an extra year just to get this tv and i know that i could wait forever and always want the next model  .
this is a wonderful tv though , everything that i put on it looks great .
so far i enjoy this set a great deal  .
it performs very well compared to some of my past hdtv's (toshiba 50 dlp , sony 46 lcd) there is nothing like a giant panasonic plasma on your wall  .
i doubt many people will regret the purchase of this tv  .
i went with panasonic due to the quality of their plasma tv  .
they make a solid plasma  .
i watch my set in the vivid mode , its what i prefer .
ok on to the error by cnet  .
the 58 version does not have the single pane of glass across the front as the 50 inch does  .
the 58 has a more traditional bezel that is raised about 1/4 inch above the screen the picture is beautiful , the blacks are deep and the colors accurate  .
the anti reflective coating works well  .
i have the set next to a large window with venetian blinds  .
with the tv off you can really see the window and the blinds , but with the tv on you really have to look for the reflection i still need to hook up my home theater receiver and speakers , but the set sounds good even without a special set up the picture could be a little bit brighter  .
its by no means too dark as the picture has a very realistic look  .
it just doesnt pop off the screen like lcds which may be a good thing .
we upgraded from a sony wega 32 flat screen and have been very impressed with the performance of the panasonic aside from a few niggles  .
blacks are fantastic and the dynamic range is excellent  .
1080 bds look superb the tv is not perfect however , hence the four star rating first , the reddish cast as referenced in the cnet review is quite noticeable on certain white and neutral tones  .
it's not a deal breaker although i'm surprised at how many scenes are affected  .
images with lots of white or even light grey , such as clouds or overcast skies , are rendered with a light , blotchy pink cast  .
skin tones however seem ok  .
also , different video sources seem to exhibit varying levels of ruddiness so your mileage may vary depending on the content you are viewing notwithstanding the red cast , the thx mode is fantastic , with excellent color reproduction straight out of the box  .
i use a nec 2690 reference grade monitor for my photography business and am amazed at how close the panasonic colors resemble those on the monitor  .
this makes it a great tv for viewing slide shows with accurate and predictable color second , i would have preferred a backlit remote  .
in a dark room it is easy to switch channels instead of volume as the two rocker switches are identical in feel and are located side by side  .
the menus however are intuitive and it only took about 30 minutes to configure the unit third , the speakers seem to lack mid range punch , especially with 5  .
1 sources  .
we have not purchased a surround sound system yet so are relying on the internal speakers for movies and games  .
we often have to change the volume to hear speech , then for action sequences we usually need to ramp the volume down finally , while standard def content looks better than i expected , with a unit this large it is easy to detect compression artifacts and other noise  .
thx seems to help somewhat , but this may be too large of a unit if you are sitting closer than 8 feet to the screen  .
this is not really a fault , but rather a recommendation to consider your size needs carefully overall we are still very pleased with the tv and are looking forward to many years of stunning image quality , especially with 1080 sources .
great price do not pass up this opportunity for a great tv  .
brandon jenko  .
we were so excited when we purchased this television love the size and all that comes with it  .
we have had it only 1 week and now it will not turn on  .
we have a friend who purchased one as well having the same problem  .
i am just glad we purchased the extended warranty just dread seeing what the future has in store with such things going on with only a week of use .
bottom line is this   it's a nice tv , but it's a premium one , and for that premium price i would expect panasonic to cover a manufacturer's defect just 2 months outside of the warranty period  .
the fact that they wo not , and it cost me $500 to repair it , is classless , and i will never again buy a panasonic product .
this will not be the most helpful review  .
it is merely a warning and an added voice to the growing number of complaints against panasonic and their indifference to known factory issues people seem to be encountering involving their products when i purchased the pz800u less than two years ago , i is in love with the product  .
i sang its praises to anyone who'd listen  .
as far as the pros , they are just like what is mentioned in the cnet review  .
i is very happy with this tv after all the research i had done fast forward to now   23 months later , and i have encountered the dreaded 10 blinks of death , a code for a faulty board in the tv  .
researching this issue i found that i am not alone in this  .
many people are experiencing similar problems  .
and stranger still , this problem seems to effect panasonic tvs around the two year mark  .
it's almost conspiratorial in its timing  .
i have contacted panasonic several times , with little help to no help , except for their directing me to a local shop which charges 1/2 the price of the tv to fix this issue shame on me for not buying an extended warranty  .
though in all fairness , who would expect such a seemingly high quality tv to experience such an old tv problem so soon  .
and with such frequency  .
i must say that i am quite disappointed in panasonic  .
i is almost too embarrassed to tell my friends about this issue       those same friends i tried to convince to buy this tv months prior now i am already considering getting a new , non    panasonic hdtv as the repair price is almost not worth salvaging this 2 year old tv with this issue and the known fading black level issue , a panasonic is no longer on my hdtv research list  .
now my panny loyalty has faded as quickly as their 2009 plasma black levels  .
and the only panasonic research i do now is for class action lawsuits against them  .
a pity as panasonic produces fine plasmas when they work so my advice is when researching good hdtvs   do not forget to look for the bad (something i neglected to do , being on a hdtv shopping high)  .
search out known issues and judge for yourself if they are worth the risk of purchase other than that , if you still must buy a panasonic , consider an extended warranty  .
especially if the frequency of a problem is high enough that odds are good you yourself may have to face the same problem as so many other people  .
a warranty will be cheaper than a trip to the tv repair shop best of luck to all current and future panasonic owners .
i bought it from buydig  .
com on 6/29/09 and got delivered today 7/7/09 and with this broken tv  .
it shut off itself 3 sec right after i turn it on i called buydig  .
com and they said there is no return or exchange for their plasma tv and gave me the number to call panasonic and wait for almost 40 minutes  .
the 1st customer service told me said they can send someone to look at it within 24 hours but when i got transfer to another customer service center for schedule , she said the the earliest is 3 days later  .
i have not choice but to take that appointment  .
avoid panasonic if you can  .
i will go with shapr or samsung for the rest of my life and tell advise anyone i know to avoid panasonic  .

Super color/contrast/HD performance.; Standard 480i performance choppy sometimes. Noisy cooling fan(s) during quiet scenes in movies. Speaker performance (Bass is useless higher than level 4)
plasma strenghts: deep blacks, uniform color throughout screen, fast response times, no off axis picture deterioration; none really, but maybe could be lighter and more energy efficient.
beautiful picture, deep blacks and natural colors, easy set up, attractive package overall; could be a little brighter.
Beautiful picture, and great price for it's size and features.; Just one, a bad flicker in 48Hz mode.
Avoid this TH-58PZ800U TV if you don't want any trouble.; I bought it from Buydig.com on 6/29/09 and got delivered today 7/7/09 and got this broken TV. I called buydig.com and they said there is no return or exchange for their Plasma TV
Colors seem very natural to myself. Images look very 3D. Blacks are very deep. Great Size for a large room. SD slot is great for high res photos.; Price, tv speakers are OK, not too many menu options. Heavy.
big..clear..big..stunning..big..; heavy..I am building a cupboard and the base sticks out about 5 inches infront of frame face so the TV sits back in the cupboard several inches.
Sharp clear picture; instructions are clear and understandable; beautiful in appearance.; Speakers are "tinny." If possible, go to a separate speaker system using external amp.
Great picture and sound; I have feature envy of the newer models that are out now and wish I had Viera cast...
Color contrast and sound are both wonderful Excellent picture quality; We have had the television only 1 week and it will not turn on.
Love the picture, especially with my DVDO Edge video processor attached. THX Color is dimmer (perfect for evening) but looks great. No problems w/TV. Football, concerts etc...I'm super-thrilled.; Says its "Deep Color" capable, but have not gotten it to process w/ Deep Color signal. No great loss...
There really isn't anything not to love about this TV. The blacks are deep, the whites are white. The colors are bold and highly accurate given the THX certification. The motion is flawless.; None, at all.
Color in THX very accurate right out of the box. Menus easy to understand and configure; Reddish cast as noted in CNET review is noticeable. Speakers not the greatest. Remote volume and channel controls hard to differentiate
Loved the TV picture quality and THX and customizeable picture.; Faulty ribbon cables (mfgr defect) made themselves known just 2 months outside of the warranty period and Panasonic refused to reimburse for the repair. Diagnostic clearly showed manufacturer defect. Grandly disappointed in Panasonic.
Aesthetics rock. The picture quality is superb. I had it calibrated by a THX certified calibrator and I can't imagine anything looking better than this does.; None so far
beautiful ,rich colors. Excellent color saturation and accuracy especially in THX mode. Picture clarity excellent. No "flicker" with 48hz picture setting. Gorgeous, piano black finish.; There is not really anything to complain about.
High contrast ratio to display perfect dark scenes in movies makes Panasonic a perfect quality Plasma TV. I recommend you check out http://www.squidoo.com/best-hdtv for information what best and cheapest HDTV to buy this year.; LCDs are generally speaking better than plasma.
Purchased from Costco for $2999; they double the warranty to 2 years. Costco guarantees to fix/replace the set in that period if something goes wrong. This 58" plasma is beautiful. Picture is as clear and sharp as any I've seen from any brand.; It didn't mount itself on the wall! Other than that, no cons yet. It's very quiet and clean looking. The anti-glare works pretty well. The sound is tremendous from the 4 hidden internal speakers.. It is heavy (140 lbs)
THX mode,Color accuracy,hd picture detail, standard definition picture quality also very good. Ability to choose from five different aspect ratios is also a big plus. All black exterior is quite handsome-tuxedo like. Quiet no buzzing. Wife likes it.; Very heavy. HD 1 and HD 2 mode should be a one click on the remote instead of having to go thru the main menu. Black bezel although handsome could be a little less reflective.
