there are fabulous reception rooms on the ground floor , sadly with no view as a horrible modern function building has been erected directly below and in front of the main building .
we ate lunch by the pool which was good and our evening meal , served in a lovely medieval dining hall , was first class with excellent service provided by mary and her husband .
also , the a/c unit was sited behind the heavy full-length curtains which meant that the only way we could cool the bedroom at night was to hitch them up on the windowsill and hope they did n't fall down .
apparently the information is being reprinted but it would have been lovely if a member of staff could have given us a guided tour as i am sure most people are attracted by the history .
similarly , the bathroom had lovely antique fittings but this meant that the over-bath shower was useless and water poured under the glass screen so the floor flooded .
there was only one socket in the room - really insufficient for two people with phones and ipads , and there was no full length mirror .
the rooms are beautiful and look totally authentic but as clearly the whole hotel has been renovated , they really have missed some obvious improvements .
they kindly put me in a lovely room on the ground floor -110- but the bathroom was still up three steep steps .
dinner was served in a lovely room at the other end of the castle but we waited 1 hour 10mins for our starter .
when i requested an alternative room , that one had similar steps up to the wardrobes and shower .
