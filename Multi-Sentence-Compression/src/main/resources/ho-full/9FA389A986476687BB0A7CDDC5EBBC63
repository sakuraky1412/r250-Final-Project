pluses : - we stayed in the premier room in the main wing .
room is extremely luxurious , well appointed and very spacious .
- attention to detail in the room can be seen , be it the quality of tea or coffee , use of branded toiletries or the high quality , sparkling clean linen & towels provided .
- special mention to the quality of mattress used- i have stayed in some high end properties around the world but the quality of mattress used at intercontinental hua hin was the best around .
very blissful , comfortable sleep .
- the pool area is the highlight of the hotel and the place where we spent most of our day .
very well designed pool with day beds and cabana 's all around overlooking the ocean , though it 's not an infinity pool .
sunken pool bar with good variety of pool snacks and cocktails ( which were extremely good ) and happy hours during certain times of the day .
the ocean is just few steps from the pool .
special mention for the hot and cold whirlpool overlooking the ocean !
- taste and quality of food was very good .
all our meals were extremely delicious , right from the breakfast to the dinner .
- overall upkeep , maintenance and cleanliness of the property was very good .
- recognition for being an ihg member was there , right from check in to check out .
- good housekeeping .
minuses : - overall service can be improved .
though i have no complain from any particular staff member but no appreciation for any particular team member either .
i expected much better service from an intercontinental brand hotel , specially considering the price i paid ( which was higher than most other similar standard resorts around this area ) .
i have experienced much better , personalised and more efficient service from other resorts in the southeast asia , for half the price !
considering the smaller size of the resort , personal touch in service was missing , though staff was always smiling and eager to help .
if the service levels met my expectation , i would have given it a 5 out of 5 .
- it is a smallish resort , not like other intercontinental resorts around ( which are much bigger is size and in facilities ) , with the main pool area being the only place for recreation and hanging out .
though i 'm not complaining about the small size , which made it easier for us to get our orientation around the resort on the first day itself and the smaller size gives the resort a more boutique -y feel but for some guests it might not work well who expect a larger resort .
