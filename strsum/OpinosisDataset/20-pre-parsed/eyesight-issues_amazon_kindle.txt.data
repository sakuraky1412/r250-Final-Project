i have not experienced eye, strain .

0 out of 5 stars a great tool for those of us with aging eyes, february 28, 2009

this means you can read for longer periods of time without eyestrain .

e, ink hardly strains your eyes .

'easy, on, the, eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink :

for me, it was no problem at all, no eye strain after reading for a few hours .

truly, this helps in my eyes .

using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .

,  eye strain is completely non, existant in my experience .

although i'm turning pages quicker, my eyes are much less tired by using a bigger font .

i noticed this almost immediately but thought it was due to my poor eyesight .

the text clarity and screen sharpness of k2 is severely disappointing and produces eye fatigue .

as it gets latei simply pump up the character size which eases tired eyes .

unfortunately my wife lost about 50 percent of her eyesight ten years ago and has not been able to enjoy reading since then .

i was starry eyed in anticipation of the newest addition to our family .

i enjoy having the text at the largest size because there is less eyestrain .

i have an  eye issue  and noticed it was getting harder to read books .

not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .

the lights are casted from the side of the reader fusing towards the center, which caused me to experience severe eye, strain .

i had old favorites, and some classics that we're told we should read, samples that had caught my eye, and lots of new choices , ,  and i held them all in my hand .
