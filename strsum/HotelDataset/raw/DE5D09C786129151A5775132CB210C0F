stayat kista located less than half an hour by metro from the center of stockholm .
if you have a time ( otherwise you should take taxi ) , it’s possible to use sl card to arrive there by public transport from arlanda airport - to take bus to marsta station , commuter train ( j ) from there to nearby railways station and one more bus to kista mall .
sl cards for 1 , 3 or 7 days are available at the airport information desk and it’s cheapest way to travel in the city .
big mall with extended working hours is located downstairs of the aparthotel and it’s very convenient to eat out or to go shopping .
good quality breakfast was served at a cafe in the shopping mall and if something was missing in the buffet you may ask the assistance of girls working there ( they always were helpful to us ) .
our one bedroom apartment was of good size and furnished in ikea style ( additional sofa of not so good quality to sleep on it ) and it was clean when we’ve checked in .
anyway , don’t expect for the service in stayat kista , because it looks more like dormitory for students and not the atmosphere of the real hotel .
receptionists were polite with us and that was the only service we 've received .
if you want to receive real appartments hotel with real service , it will be different money in expensive city like stockholm .
overall it 's not bad solution . . .
