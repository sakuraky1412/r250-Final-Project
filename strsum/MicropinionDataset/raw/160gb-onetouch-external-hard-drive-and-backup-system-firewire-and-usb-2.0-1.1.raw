Pros:. Good paper manual, smart and simple use. 
Cons:. Needs proper care as all external disk drives do !. 
Summary:. My Maxtor OneTouch 160G works as advertised. Easy OneTouch incremental duplication, and automatic incremental backup are very nice, and work well.. Here are my own tips as a token of appreciation for Cnet public service to users (I'm quite a newbie, don't take this as a too serious piece of advice). 1) First the Maxtor unit configuration has to be done following step by step the useful paper manual. I read it all and found a lot of useful information there. 2) Quit Skype, Google desktop and some "resident protection" software can be a good idea before big back ups. 3) Don't move the drive during use. 4) Always quit your Maxtor with the safe remove utility from XP. 5) Do not overuse the unit, so that it does not get exceedingly warm. 5) always use a stabilized power supply (stabilizer) so that the electric power has not micro cuts. 6) When not in use it is a good idea to keep the Maxtor unit switched off to save its inernal parts. 7) Generally keep the unit in possibly a rather fresh and well ventilated area. On the rear side of the unit there are some cooling holes which should have enough space for air flow. 8) Use defrag from time to time for your computer as well as for your Maxtor external drive (although it is quite long). 9) Do not relie exclusively on your Maxtor external drive to save your data. It can be used best as back up for your computer data, but your data should be stored or preserved in two different places at least : your computer hard disk and your Maxtor external drive for instance. So in case of a computer crash or external disk drive crash, one set of your data remains intact. 10) If you can have Norton Ghost it is also a good idea to also back up your data on your Maxtor external drive using Ghost. The advantage of Ghost is that recovery can be a bit more simple to implement. Partition, Windows and service packs don't have to be reinstalled first with Ghost after the crash, although it is the case with the Retrospect Express software provided with the One Touch line of products. 11) After several years please accept that your external disk drive might be a bit worn out, and prepare to buy a new one....

Pros:. Portable and Dependable. 
Cons:. Heavy &#38; Large. 
Summary:. I have had this drive for over a year and it has been very reliable. I purchased a camera case for traveling and the power source requirement is sometimes a pain. What I like best is that I don't have to carry my notebook computer wherever I go and/or I can plug into any computer to transfer files.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to load and unload files. No lag even when running files from the Maxtor.. 
Cons:. Wish the power cord was not so large. Plenty heavy too, but that can be a good thing, in the rare case you drop it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quiet, compact and fast. OneTouch make frequent system-wide backups simple. Solid software. Seamless integreation.. 
Cons:. It wasn't free? Even with a Mac it needed a driver to work perfectly, but it does work perfectly.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large capacity, Fast transfer. 
Cons:. One-touch backup software. 
Summary:. I've had this drive for almost 2 years and haven't had any problems with it. The only thing I haven't like is the "One-Touch" backup software. It seems like it takes longer to get this running correctly than it is to just drag and drop what I need backed up. I realize that doesn't work for everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice External Data Storage Device. 
Cons:. Poor Case Cooling Design Causing Excessive Heat. 
Summary:. I purchased the Drive in July of 2003 and immediately noticed the heat build up on the top of the case when using it for a short period. I measured the temp and it does reach the high 80's--low 90's. WAY TOO HOT! This compares to the Dell Dimension PC operating in 60's. At the time I called Maxtor questioning why this unit had no cooling fan--it didn't need one. Well that was definitely a line, however I was assured they would stand behind the drive(for a year)--but not my data. I bought an $4.95 8" desk fan and it runs when the Maxtor runs. It sets about 10" away, aimed at the insufficent, natural ventilation holes in the front. This simple cooling(air flow) drops the temp to the 60's-70's. And another way to keep the data safe is only run the maxtor when you need to use it. One touch is a fine idea, but continuous running or this drive with no additional cooling is its END!. From reading many reviews I can see it is a crash waiting to happen without a fan. My Maxtor drive and its 8" cooling fan are still doing a great job. As a rule--the cooler electronics run the longer they last--Maxtor ignored this rule in the poor cooling design of this unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast and quiet, excellent backup software.. 
Cons:. Gets rather warm after one or two hours runtime. Maybe this will lead to early failure but I don't know yet.. 
Summary:. I have had this drive for about a month and am very happy with it - so far. I use it strictly as a network attached storage device and therefore am not able to use nor do I need the one touch feature. Other posts regarding early failure may yet prove prophetic for my drive to. It does get very warm after heavy use. I will definitely come back to this forum and tell all if the thing fails in the next two or three months.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good throughput for an external drive, and has a sturdy solid-feeling aluminum enclosure. I use this drive without the One-Touch software, and I don't know really why you would. It's so easy just to select the folders and files you want to copy and move. 
Cons:. Unit is pretty heavy, which makes it hard to tote around in a backpack all the time with my laptop.. 

$$;
Pros:. quiet, nice design, usb and firewire, mac and pc. 
Cons:. apparently the packaged software sucks?. 
Summary:. I don't know what the fuss is all about. I've had my 160GB one touch for 6 months plus and i've had no problems. I have it running 24/7 under my computer desk with limited air circulation and i've had zero problems. I've never used it for backing up my internal HD and i've never used the software it came with. I use mine for music, downloads and as a video scratch.. 

$$;
Pros:. On/off switch, great for portability. 
Cons:. Hangtime on shutdown. 
Summary:. I'm a DJ and using the drive as a portable jukebox combined with my laptop has made gigs so much easier. No more hauling vinyl or cds. I can now take over 7000 320kbps song files with me wherever I go. Try doing that with vinyl!. 

$$;
Pros:. I use this drive to store data for all of my clients as well as to store many GB of mp3 files. I have dropped it on the ground several times while powered on and it hasn't skipped a beat.. 
Cons:. The backup software is difficult to use and is quite slow.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size dor an external 3.5 inch drive. Quiet. USB2. Good as an external drive...... 
Cons:. ..but back-up software worthless! On off switch on back!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice aluminum enclosure, 8Mb buffer, good throughput, Mac AND PC compatible, plug and play, efficent design, very quiet, stackable, firewire daisy chain option, didn't even need to install software to use (although recommended), seems solid and have had n. 
Cons:. included "one touch" software is worthless. Just use it as a normal drive, drag and drop files, etc. power switch seems flimsy, illuminated blue button looks cool but that's about it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Hardware seems reliable and reasonably fast using USB 2.0. Retrospect Express is a very nice application and is well supported by Dantz. The lower rating is due to the USB interface problems.. 
Cons:. I've had nothing but problems trying to "Safely Remove Hardware" from USB ports on at least three different OS (WinXP, Win2000, Win 2003 Server). Most of the time, I get a message indicating the drive is busy and to try unplugging later. Maxtor doesn't fe. 

$$;
Pros:. Relatively good deal, nice hard enclosure. 
Cons:. I bought this harddrive in late July and since then it has crashed on me 4 times. First time I got an I/O error when I tried accessing the drive, I reformatted and everything seemed to work fine. Second time, I had data on there I wanted to keep, so I r. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice size. 
Cons:. I used the latest Maxtor drivers and USB 2.0 driver. It took 4 hours to backup 12 GB. On my WDC USB external hard it was only 45 minutes to back up using the Firewire connection.. 

$$;
Pros:. didn't completely break on me. 
Cons:. power cord!. 
Summary:. After my computer's internal hard drive crashed, I reached over endearingly to my maxtor ext hard drive I had backed everything up onto, and it wouldn't turn on. At the end of the day it seemed to be a power cord problem (which is weird, no external damage, no rough handling) so I got most of my data back. Maybe us whiners got a bad batch, but I'm thumbs down on this one too. True also that it heats up to an alarming temperature.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very nice drive, works well and is pretty decent space for money. Oh, and it is pretty too.. 
Cons:. Too bad it's average lifespan seems to be about 2 months. If you want to backup data just for the hell of it and never plan on needing the data afterwards and would be okay with your data being lost to a head crash (and like a monthly trip to your retaile. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to install. Replaced the first crashed drive quickly.. 
Cons:. My first drive had 60GB of backed up files and crashed, all the data gone. The replacement drive from Maxtor was 50GB full when it also crashed. I did not even bother replacing the 2nd one.. 

$$;
Pros:. None - be sure to back up your info two more ways!. 
Cons:. Defective Merchandise and Deceptive Practices. 
Summary:. I bought the Maxtor One Touch III (160 GB) a few months ago to store my photos and music and other things that were slowing down my pc. Earlier today, I tried to access my photos and realized that my computer was no longer recognizing the Maxtor drive and there was no power getting to it. After checking out all "simple" fixes, I called the Maxtor / Seagate help line. Within a minute, the woman I spoke to was able to determine what was wrong (obviously they've had some experience with this type of problem) and informed me that the device had failed. She told me that it's under warranty until May 2008, so I will be able to have it replaced, but if I want the information off of the drive, I will have to "pay" to have that information recovered by their "recovery service." I contacted them and was informed that they would attempt to retrieve the information, and if they were successful I would be charged somewhere around $1,400.00!!!! I have all of my digital photos on here from the past three years..births, parties, vacations, grandchildren...you name it it's on there! I said I didn't understand why I would have to pay when it was their defective merchandise which caused the loss. The customer service attendant BLAMED ME for not using at least two other forms of backup! I'll admit that I was foolish in not backing up the photos to disks, and I won't make that mistake again. I am heartsick at the mementos that I have lost. I have to wonder, though, which is more profitable for Seagate / Maxtor...selling drives or charging customers exorbitant fees to recover information from their defective devices?. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works, backs up with press of a button, quickly. 
Cons:. just stopped working and the seagate website is nightmare of unhelpful info. 
Summary:. My backup harddrive just died. I press the blue button (as I have done for over 2 years) and nothing happens. There's no software button on my desktop to do a back up so the external drive now just sits there useless. I've had two good years but the seagate website is indecipherable so just to keep my life easy, I'm just going to buy another. But definitely not another Maxtor. This was supposed to be my backup. It hardly gets used. What a hunk of junk.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy operation. 
Cons:. Not trustable. 
Summary:. My sister brought to me this 200GB Maxtor Ext HD (OneTouch II) in december beggining (i live in Brazil). One month later my computer couldn�t recongnize it anymore. I had moved all my digital photos to it and, suddenly, i couldn�t get then back. The problem is we can�t do much thing with a USB device. There�s no configuration, setups or anything else we can do to recover the data.. I wrote to Maxtor because the 2 blue leds in front of the drive started to blink together, but the led code on the Maxtor site doesn�t inform this situation.. After 6 or 7 asked and answers emails they couldn�t tell me what�s going on. Like in Brazil, these help desks centers are trully awful and they know less than we about they own products.. Well, finnaly i asked Maxtor if i sent the hd to US they would try to recover my data back. They said no. They would just give me another drive.. The important to me wasn�t the drive, but the data. So, i realize it would be safer with me.. I made a research in the net about this drive and i learned 2 things: a lot of costumers had problems with this product and it is just a internal drive with a external case.. Maxtor said to me i shouldn�t open the external case because i would lose warranty but, like i said, if i had spent the drive to US i wouldn�t see my photos again.. I oppened the drive and installed it internally. It worked ok and i could get my data back. So, now i have a traditional 200GB internal drive working fine.. I tell you, my friends, don�t use this drive for backups. It�s not trustable.. 

$$;
Pros:. none really. 
Cons:. Not reliable, slow, lost data, corrupted, freezes computer bad support. 
Summary:. This it a terrible hard drive. It worked OK, but VERY SLOWLY for the first few weeks. I used it mainly as backup and extra storage for videos, mp3s, and pictures. I have it partitioned into 2 drives. The backup partition was lost once and I had to reformat, but luckily I did not loose any data. The other partition was "corrupted" once before, but the data *magically* recovered. Now it is having problems again. Chkdisk is frozen and won't close, My Computer won't open, the drive won't stop for safe removal, and it seems that only the data that **isn't** backed up is gone. a 13gb folder subbenly became "empty".. Maxtor's support is only monday-friday, 8-5. I am not availible during those times. They do have email support (I just sent one).. In addition to the non-reliability, it is SLOW. On the computer it is connected to, it transfers at up to 130 megabytes per second. On another computer with two internal drives, the transfer rate for backup is over 1000 megabytes per second. With this drive it can take many hours to back up.. Do not buy it, and if you have one, do not trust it for important data.. 

$$;
Pros:. Keeps my food hot, but doesn't burn the bottom (intentional?). 
Cons:. I have 5 of these. 2 of them have failed multiple times. I think it's because of the heat, but it could also be poor construction on the cable connections. Tried both daisychained firewire, single connected firewire and USB. Either way I get errors on 2 o. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought one of these from Costco for a new Dell system and it just stopped working after 4 months. None of the manufacturer's trouble shooting steps worked. I bought a second one at Costco and it just stopped working in three months. I now own two non. 
Cons:. great boat anchor. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works it seems to do the job except for the software which doesn't work at all.. 
Cons:. My first 250 MB drive completely crashed after 3 months. I just got the replacement which after 2 hours of futzing with still isn't recognized by my computer. DOA. I've never even heard of a hard drive with such low reliability.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek apperance, plug and play simplicity.. 
Cons:. Had two 200Gb of these drives first one failed in the first month, after loosing all data on previous model (blue case Maxtor) after 12 months and 1 week. To their credit, Maxtor did replace hardware though.. 

$$;
Pros:. Thought this would have good storage sizes and they're relatively cheap. In theory the one touch system makes backing data up an easy task.. 
Cons:. I've had 2 of these (the original and an RMA replacement) after that one died within the warranty period. These are junk drives! First one dying I could accept (lots of bad sectors). Every once in a while you get a dud. I lost data, but was okay once. 

$$;
Pros:. storage size. 
Cons:. doesn't work. 
Summary:. This external hard drive does not work. I can't get any of my files off of it. I have tried to explain it to the company and they don't understand what I'm telling them. I put all my music and picture files on it via drag and drop, and now can't get them off. I can't get any access to the drive. It tells me to insert a disk.... and OBVIOUSLY THERE IS NO PLACE TO INSERT A DISK.. IT IS THE DISK. I would never recommend this product and for sure will never buy another one. Their ads are misleading since they claim it is so easy to use... it's a nightmare. Period.. 

$$;
Pros:. price, overall appearance. 
Cons:. performance, durability, warranty. 
Summary:. This drive is fine the first three months you have it, then it turns into a nightmare. I have lost more data than I care to think about using Maxtor drives. BUY LaCIE!!! They are 100 times better.. 

$$;
Pros:. its external. 
Cons:. Very poor case design. I lost nearly 20 gigs of data using this HD. Anytime I use it for longer than an hour (say playing music) it gets extremely hot. Bottom line if you are scared of loosing lots of data DONT BUY THIS!. 

$$;
Pros:. Bought from Costco so I can get a cash refund. PLEASE SEE BELOW!!. 
Cons:. I SPENT 30,000 MINUTES(that's right, 20 + DAYS worth of time) archiving my music collection and the hard drive crashed during the warranty period. Maxtor said they were not responsible and said I could go to a data recovery service but they would not pay. 

$$;
Pros:. plug and play, nice design. 
Cons:. It is not mentionned on the box but installation of "one touch" doesn't work with nt2K...it's not a bug it's the editor's choice...I've mail it to support...no response.... 

$$;
Pros:. well, it looks pretty. 
Cons:. Hard Drive did not initially boot up (took about 20 mins), then once it did, would suddenly power off with no warning (after about 10 mins of use) - would not reboot for about 8 hrs (I assuming the problem was over heating). Repeat. Just Brutal. I also.
