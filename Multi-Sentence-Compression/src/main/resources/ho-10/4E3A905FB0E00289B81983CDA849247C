we stayed at the swan because we were travelling with our dog , but i can appreciate that for people who do n't like dogs , the swan may not be the best place , as there are a lot of them , although to be fair dogs are not allowed in the main restaurant .
the common theme then , is a bunch of hard working staff , in a hotel in a great location , and serving great food , who just need a bit of common sense management to organise them properly .
breakfast was much the same , with guests waiting a long time to order , and then watching dishes arrive in an ad hoc fashion , in no particular order , and again with little knowledge by the staff of who had ordered what .
top marks went to the barman , who wrestled with taking drinks orders , and serving food to 3 different lounge areas , while the rest of the staff focussed on the restaurant .
if you want basic , then the battered fish and chips is above the average , but other dishes on then menu are to a good restaurant standard .
checkin was in theory from 4:00pm , later than the average hotel , yet there were still people waiting in reception for their rooms to be ready at 4:30 .
in fact , grasmere is probably the most dog friendly place i have visited in the uk , with most of the shops bearing `` dogs welcome '' stickers .
on decor and cleanliness , suffice it to say that some areas of the hotel are very tired .
the special on one night was a delicious duo of salmon and haddock , with lemon sauce , served with herb mash .
in our case , during checkin the staff lost our registration card ( the bit you normally use as proof of signature for extras ) , but we managed without .
