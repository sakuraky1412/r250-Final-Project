 the machine has the most comfortable small keyboard i've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .

 it won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, i'll take the latter .

 smaller size videos   play even smoother .
