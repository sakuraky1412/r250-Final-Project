pound for pound (or rather gram for gram) the best hand held pmp video , music , web , ect  .
player on this side of saturn  .
as with any brand new high end product , problems may arise from time to time , (mostly from third party apps) but this is a must have for any real tech enthusiast  .
it blows away the touch and all others pretty easily don't believe the hype  .
some people (i  .
the editor at cnet who wrote the review for the archos)are just i    anything fanboys  .
we see mac loyalists all the time turning a blind eye or trash talking anything that comes close , let alone anything that flat out spanks , one of their precious mac encrusted gadgets  .
think about it    whens the last time you saw a mac commercial where they simply talked about their own product  .
been awhile  .
don't get me wrong , this concept does not apply across the board to all mac users but you know who you are  .
lol  .
that being said the itouch/iphone are a great products but they just can not do what the archos 5 android can  .
for starters lets talk video   if you want to play a video on a touch/iphone (lets refer to them both as mac's for posterity sake from now on) you first have to most likley convert it and then using only one program (i    tunes) copy it over to your device  .
whereas with the archos , it plays just about every format known to man , even 720p hd natively with the available codec (although an extra $39  .
99 us) and transfers via drag n drop or sync with wmp  .
not to mention the screen is simply gorgeous with 800 x 480 on the device  .
oh yeah , it's also a dvr when coupled with the optional docking station with the ability to play in hd via hdmi on your compatible hdtv  .
not to mention a whole host of webtv and online video accessible via the archos media array on the main desktop screen  .
then theres the fact that the archos out specs and performs when it comes to music playback and features across the board  .
look the bottom line is this   the archos 5 android does too many things to mention here and it does all of them very well  .
the mac's our great and even refined products , as they have been around for a while , but in my opinion as well as many others it is easily beet by the original archos 5 , without android  .
the features of the archos 605 are far more impressive then the mac's  .
and that is something that i and the editors of cnet can agree with  .
these new models are just icing on the cake  .
what ever device you choose , good hunting and heres to technology  .
whatever the brand  .

donald bell , as usual , rates this as an apple fanboy  .
how come his review of the similar priced ipod touch does not list non    existing gps , flash , 800x480 4  .
8 screen and the video codecs support as bad points  .
archos improved or even fixed gps , mkv 720p in the latest firmware   http  //update  .
archos  .
com/7/archos5/changes_firmware_archos5  .
html donald bell should remove gps from the bad of his review and change the rating to rate it better the the similar priced ipod touch sure archos needs the full android marketplace , but you cannot blame it on archos when google is still releasing android 1  .
6 and 2  .
0 updates in the next days and weeks that are the first versions of android to support the kind of medium density 800x480 4  .
8 touchscreen that archos is using  .
i would rate this product 4  .
5/5 for currently lacking android marketplace and google apps  .
but as i expect the full android apps support to come within weeks on the archos so my rating stays 5/5 cause i don't think cnet allows me to update my review  .
if you absolutely need full marketplace and google apps , wait for the firmware updates and follow http  //forum  .
archosfans  .
com to see when users report which apps that work already today or later (because hundreds do work fine today , and most  .
apk files for android applications that you can find on the internet will install by simply finding them through google and clicking on them) follow the discussions on my forum to see if archos will support the full bitrates of mkv 720p movies above 3500kbit/s  .
i haven't tested todays new firmware update that claims to improve mkv h264 support through    .
video   h264 sd high profile did not play  .
video   allow smoother h264 hd playback in some cases  .
video   seeking in mkv file sometimes caused audio or video freeze  .
until this firmware at least , 720p mkv support up to 3500kbit/s means 720p mkv tv series would playback fine (if archos fix the audio synch issue on those hd mkv files) since there is no other device in the world to support 720p mkv on android or any other os , i found mkv support to be a really nice surprise so even if full high bitrate 720p movies would not be supported even with the best optimized firmware update archos can come with , i still don't think it should lower my rating  .
since archos provides the absolute best video playback , storage and streaming experience in the world no matter what  .
for example , archos supports to stream youtube hd at 1280x720 and 2mbit/s of those files , outputted to your hdtv through hdmi , which makes it the absolute best youtube player in the world i haven't been able to test 3g bluetooth tethering , but with sipdroid and other voip applications on android , i do believe this could replace mobile phones to provide you with the most affordable free mobile phone system since the archos 5it at 8gb starts at $249 msrp and street prices may go below the $200 and many countries have sim cards for hsdpa to use for 3g tethering using any cheap $50 mobile phone for $20 per month pre    paid without the need to sign any contracts  .
imagine runing google voice , skype and sip telephony on that setup , i think it could be pure awesomeness (although i haven't been able to test it yet) archos could release a version with built    in 3g (which i would love even more) , though i probably would not rate that 6/5 cause with built    in 3g comes other constraints , like a probably more expensive purchase price of the product if unlocked ($100 extra  .
$200 extra  .
) , or a compulsary 2    year subscription plan with a carrier in many markets such as in usa , france and some other countries where it's the 3g carriers that make the law there are some good reasons for the ipod touch to be selling faster than the iphone at the moment  .
price , and not having to subscribe for $1500 over a 2    year contract with a carrier  .
archos 5 internet tablet positions archos perfectly against the much inferior ipod touch .
i have always enjoyed archos video devices , and the newest device maintains the great video experience both from screen size / resolution , and codec support perspectives  .
i have streamed videos from my nas devices to the archos devices since the 605 wifi , and the new device streams fine even from older nas devices without upnp support the new browser is the best mobile browser i have used bar none  .
i prefer the zooming on the archos browser to multi    touch  .
when you swipe the screen lightly , the zoom controls appears on the bottom so you can see the impact of the zoom when pressing the + or    icons without your fingers blocking your view as they do with multi    touch  .
i find the archos zooming to be easier , and less awkward than multi    touch with the added benefit of not blocking the screen  .
even more important , when you zoom a webpage , the text reflows so you can read pages without having to horizontal scrolling each line  .
i prefer mobile pages on screens 7 , and the text reflows on single column pages ensures you can read the pages with a larger text size without the dreaded horizontal scrolling  .
one of my biggest disappointments with the ipod touch is the lack of reflow when you use multi    touch zoom which results in having to horizontal scroll each line to read some single column pages at a comfortable text size  .
imo , the archos browser with its constant text reflows when zooming results in the best mobile browser experience  .
although the default is to id as a mobile browser , a browser setting allows you to change this to id as a desktop  .
the review indicated problems watching cnet tv due to limited flash support  .
hopefully , that will be corrected when andoid releases full flash 10 support  .
in the interim , the videos on iphone  .
cnet  .
com play fine concerning photo zooming , i prefer the methods for zooming photos on the archos to multi    touch  .
if you hold your finger at the point you want to zoom the picture , the picture zooms until you release the finger  .
a lot easier , and less awkward than multi    touch for me  .
in addition , a finger friendly slider appears at the bottom of the screen to allow finer control without the zooming control blocking your view i have not tried the gps as this feature is not needed since i have stand alone gps in car i have only tried the micro    sdhc card from my phone (16gb) , and it is discovered immediately , with no trouble viewing pictures , and videos from the card i do wish the archos 5 imt had a replaceable battery , this trend toward no user replaceable batteries is a bad trend for me  .
i know the archos devices have an optional external battery attachment , but it is not as powerful , or convenient as an actual replaceable internal battery the review indicated how convenient the built    in stand is on the archos device  .
for me , this is an essential feature for watching videos  .
with other devices , i am constantly searching for a place to lean the device against while i watch videos  .
i appreciate the built    in stand every day i use the device as you can tell by the tone of my review , i am a big fan of archos devices , and have been since the av500  .
the bigger screen makes for an excellent mobile video platform , and the android addition promises many new exciting features in the future particulary with android 2  .
0 supporting multiple resolutions without recompiling code .
this is an excellent platform for entertainment , reference , ebooks , and games i used this as my sole pc for about 2 weeks  .
while it is painful (screen is resistive) at times , the browser (i also downloaded opera) , email (k9) , and included ms office compatable suite kept me going , as long as i is in range of wifi stability of applications is pretty good the gps , which does not use google maps , is quite good , and the full map database lives on the device  .
very helpful when driving out of cell range areas , where google maps just cannot handle it kindle is probably the application i use the most  .
it is a very nice size to read on the subway you do need to use astro to 'backup' the android market from a cell phone w/ android 1  .
this will let you install it on the archos 5  .
you cannot use archos's crappy market afterwards , but who cares  .
my kids love the video playback and the games which use the accelerometer (e  .
paper airplanes) this is an affordable , flexible device for entertainment , general pc tasks (limited by use of virtual keyboard       a bluetooth keyboard would have made this better) , web browsing , email , and even research (e  .
evernote runs fine on it) .
this is perhaps the best media player i have purchased and while the browser and keyboard has its quirks , i have not experienced the crashing issues that others complain about  .
this is perfect for someone who wants a decent media player for long trips or boring meetings this is for you  .
i use this mostly as a couch device since that's when i think about using it  .
the n ew firmware updates means that it very rarely freezes up and then only when i leave a whole lot of things open without remembering to close them  .
i haven't rooted my device and its not really necessary for me  .
i am content with the market app you can get from the forums so you have have access to more than the archos 5 approved applications  .
my only issue with it now is that my cell contract is expiring next month and i'm considering getting the droid incredible , but if i have that there would be no point in the archos 5    ( hmmm , then again , i do not need to pay an addition $30 per month for internet access with the archos 5 and consider how much $30 a month adds up to over 2 years .
when i started shopping for an android competetor to the ipod touch , i is mostly doing it because i wanted an mp3 player , not a smartphone  .
i already have a phone and have no need of a smartphone and it's expensive data plan  .
on top of that , there is only one place i visit on a regular basis that does not have open wifi , so this device is a shoe in i reduced the device's score mostly because of the touchscreen being resistive instead of capacitive , which causes random screen presses sometimes when the device is in your pocket , but not locked i'd rather that the device used usb mini , instead of usb micro , but the adapters to change from one to the other are only about $1 on amazon all in all , if you're looking for an android device and do not want a smartphone or you want an ipod touch , without itunes or the restrictive and skitzophrenic apple app store , this is the device for you  .
this is an excellent media player with internet connectivity  .
if what you need is a small computer , get a netbook the official cnet review is unnecessarily harsh  .
knocking a device because it shows fingerprints  .
no multi    touch  .
so what  .
this is not an ipod , which is a good thing  .
the archos 5 imt plays a ton of formats and is just the thing for those users who have a clue and don't want to be restricted by apple/itunes  .
just copy over your media , and go  .
since it plays so many formats , it's likely your media files will play without any conversion necessary the browser is very good  .
i use it from my couch as if it is a netbook , and i use it when i'm out and about when i find a wifi hot    spot  .
all it's missing is the ability to play flash vids  .
otherwise , it loads complicated pages (like ign and cnet) quickly and completely  .
the bigger screen makes browsing much better than on any phone  .
it handles multiple pages easily and remembers passwords/cookies as well as other settings i could have spent a little more and got a netbook , but the archos 5 imt is the perfect size for me to put in my backpack and not even notice it's there  .
even the smallest netbook would be too big to carry everywhere and too cumbrsone to use on a bus or train  .
i can grab this thing and fire it up (with my bluetooth headphones) anywhere and not bother anyone i have not even mentioned android  .
it is a brilliant move for archos to choose android as the os  .
the release of v2  .
0 will make a great media player only better one final note  .
this is the first archos product i've ever owned  .
i'm no fan    boy  .
i do , however , appreciate a very functional and well    rounded product  .
it's certainly not perfect , but no device is completely without fault if you are looking for an excellent media player that supports a ton of formats and has a great browser , this product is worth a look  .
if all you care about is multi    touch (cnet) then go buy an ipod .
this thing kicks badunk    a    dunk  .
overall , it is an awesome device  .
it plays just about anything you load into it  .
i haven't run accross anything it will not play , but i did have to purchase a plug    in that turned on the support for one of the video formats  .
that sucked it is soo easy to load this thing with music or videos  .
no itunes , no media players necessary  .
just drag and drop files right into the appropriate folder on the device and you are ready to go  .
too easy  .
you can use media player 11 to  .
synch , but you do not have to  .
there is a dvr module you can buy that allows you to record tv or any other source so that you can take all of your video with you as long as you are doing one or two things simultaneously the unit works fine , but it will get a little choppy and fussy if you force it to multi task too much bluetooth is a selling point and it works just fine  .
i hate wires  .
you can completely customize the home screen with wallpaper as well as the colors of the menu buttons , etc  .
the selected wallpaper scrolls as you wipe from page to page also video and audio play perfectly on this unit with lots of audio playback options including id tag support  .
it will play wmv protected files , your standard issue mp3 , and various lossless formats  .
there is also a 5    band eq with presets and a balance control  .
video files play flawlessly as well on the big screen which is sharp and rich with color  .
best screen i have seen on a media player this side of a laptop  .
there are motion thumbnails for the video files when you highlight then and you can pick your thumbnails as well  .
i guess that's useful , i dunno  .
what is useful however , is the buit    in kickstand that will let you stand the unit up at an angle to view it on a desk or wherever  .
no need to by a dock when it already has its own leg to stand on  .
the need to buy a unit with a lot of storage is not as paramount because it has expandable memory via sd card micro the form factor is small considering the overall size of the player  .
not nearly as bulky as it looks on tv  .
the screen is dominate and the back of the unit is a glossy carbon , metal    like finish  .
i'd invest in terrycloth for this unit however , if i were you  .
having a slim formfactor means that the parts on the inside are closer to the outside and there is not much between you and the internals  .
what i mean is that this baby gets hot on the interface side (left when in landscape) pretty quick  .
after about 7    10 songs in succession it got hot enough that i looked for a place to set it down  .
not burning    cannot    handle    it hot , but whoa    i    didn't    think    it'd    get    this    hot warm  .
a plus in the pocket during winter i'd imagine the gps , well , cnet is right , it sucks  .
i have yet to get mine to work and i've got all the latest firmware  .
it will not find a sat signal at all and i is in the middle of a lot with narry a tree or building within 200 meters  .
the only disappointment on the unit  .
i tried different locations and times of day , no joy people have slammed the archos 5 for its poor apps support  .
i say , so what  .
personally , i could not care less about what can buy for it or download on it  .
i bought it to play music and movies/videos and to web surf  .
i do not need extra gimmicky crap sucking up my storage space  .
i don't care that there's an app that lets you open your garage from the couch or whatever the web browser works great  .
it looks good and it loads content fast  .
very easy to scroll and scale the pages and the built in accelorometer orients the screen to however you hold it , though it does have a delay  .
there is also support for email (various types) and you can configure multiple accounts  .
lots of wireless options too  .
wifi , bluetooth , and piggyback sharing  .
you can pipe your 3g phone through this unit and use its internet as long as your phone supports it  .
you can also answer calls when your phone rings  .
they really did not want you to have reason to put it down admittedly , the touch interface is not as silky as the i    whichever  .
sometimes thinking about it first before it responds , but most of the time it works great  .
the transition from portrait to landscape looks cooler on the i    whatever too , but it is not a dealbreaker  .
zooming on photos is a single finger sinch  .
you just touch where you want to zoom  .
no two finger pinch dance bottom line   if you want a media player and not a portable accessorizer station , then this is for you  .
it plays nearly everything you throw at it , and it surfs the internet with its host of connection options with ease  .
consider the gps a happy accident , if it works for you  .

great and fast web browsing and video player .
i own the 604 wifi  .
like it okay  .
here's my beef  .
i purchased the add    ons and would like to buy this unit but i cannot use the add    ons for other archos products  .
they all must be repurchased for each device  .
that's like saying you would need to purchase the same song from itunes for each ipod you own  .
wait a minute that's the way it use to be until they changed the policy archos needs to treat the customer better and at the very least give you a substantial discount off the add    ons if you purchase a second device .
i wo not recommend this product until the sort out the technical support mess .
wanted to love it but it is a huge dissapointment with too many shortcomings to deal with  .
stay away , buy something from nokia , apple or a netbook from samsung  .
i is excited about this media device at first but after hours of toying with the device i quickly became aware that it really doesn't do anything different from what i use my cell phone for  .
when using the web on the archos it becomes very challenging as u often hit unwanted web links simply trying to scroll up or down a page  .
the home button doesnt seen to work in landscape mode so i found myself flipping the device , then pressing 'home' to get it to work  .
wifi works excellent but in most wifi spots i will have my notebook anyway , like hotels , or at home , etc i is looking to use the cell phone to tethered feature and i could not get it to work  .
after i paired my blackberry to my archro via bluetooth it said that it is paired , but not connected  .
i would expect that if it's paried then it would be connected  .
this ordeal really killed my want for this device as i is looking to use it for times when i is more on    the    go and on    the    fly and didn't feel like pulling out my laptop  .
if u have a good quality phone like the storm , droid , or iphone then i don't see the need for the archos  .
the full web browser is an advantage but it's a chore to use imo  .
i just do not think this device is worth the price tag .
a great media player but considering it costs as much as an entry level laptop , it performs badly at everything else  .
a recent firmware upgrade does not seem to have helped much either  .
i'm very disappointed in it and wished i'd saved my money by buying a cheaper archos model just to play media on .
after owning and throwing away an archos 605 wi    fi with all of the supposed software and firmware updates , i finally took a sledge hammer to the $300    plus device that is all promises and no delivery excuses upon excuses from the company on what the problems were , and nothing but freezes and reboots  .
after getting nowhere with their tech support ( that's a laugh  .
) , i finally gained some much needed pleasure from the device by smashing it with a sledgehammer , and throwing it in the dumpster yes , a bit drastic , perhaps , but well worth the money when it came to destroying it after so much bulls#$% from a company that has fooled a lot of trusting customers  .
i finally got an ipod touch and iphone , and have not looked back buyers beware    stay far away from archos  .
archos used to be known as a maker of decent pmp  .
alas , no longer  .
nowadays they are into making junk  .
had i not have known the company , i would have decided that the makers of this half    baked internet tablet have no experience whatsoever of making handhelds  .
is their headlong decision to jump on the android bandwagon to blame  .
i guess so because the operating system (a very good one  .
) seems to have been poorly adapted to the hardware  .
hence all those freezes and acting up  .
besides , i do not know who came up with the browser on this tablet , the fella should be prohibited to write code for life .
i bought archos android on the premise of it being a versatile ultraportable , something with more screen estate than the ipod touch but at the same time more portable than a regular netbook  .
i've had the thing for about a week and am in the process of returning it  .
honestly , it is hard for me to find anything positive to say about this tablet  .
this is clearly an unfinished product first , it is painfully slow  .
i don't know how the cnet reviewer missed that  .
android is a fairly efficient os , but it rather feels like the tablet is powered by the infamous windows vista  .
there is this annoying lag , no matter what i do  .
as the hardware seems to be adequate , i conclude that the problem lies in the operating system having been poorly adapted for this archos model then , there's a host of bugs and just plain inexplicable weirdness  .
the web browser apparently has a problem rendering css correctly  .
as a result , viewing more complex web sites is impossible because the browsers turns those into unreadable mess  .
the email client works intermittently  .
sometimes it syncs with my exchange account , sometimes it does not  .
wifi goes off frequently , without any reason  .
i have no idea if the gps system works at all because it's been unable to locate a signal (in calgary and surrounding areas)  .
finally , the whole system on the archos is prone to crashing so that i've had to reboot the device several times already my impression is that archos rushed their android tablet to the market without a thorough beta    testing  .
the tablet may be good in theory , but right now it requires a lot of further development and debugging .
beautiful screen but almost useless for things you really would like to do  .
netbooks are far better .
i purchased this product and have sent it in for repairs  .
i will send it back for a refund because people report a repair does not help  .
the firmware does not make the device work properly  .
it freezes all the time  .
the wireless fails to connect often and will not stay connected  .
the bluetooth when used with a headset causes the audio of videos to be out of sync  .
the bluetooth does not connect all the time and does not stay connected  .
people are reporting these problems in many forums  .
the worst part of this device is that it will freeze up often  .
i can not get through an hour of videos or music before it freezes and requires a reboot  .
the company continues to sell the device despite the fact that they have not gotten them to work yet  .
i would caution everyone not to purchase this device because it has major issues  .
not everything on it works as described and many built in android programs do not work .
archos customer service sucks and archos is known as a ghost company that cannot be reached when you need to fix your device , the device won't do what it sez out of the box the hd needs a plugin not to mention the dvr station the gps don't work the battery meter lines starts desapearing after 2 music videos 8 minutes of video in medium light setting the headphone jack and the usb jack are really delicate mine is loose and the sound on the right ear breaks if i move the device too much and in most stores a saw the device with the usb totally loose and not working at all but i thought it wo not happen to me i try to contact the company but even with registration all they did is ask for my information again for them to contact me later i'm still waiting after 3 weeks  .
updated  .
on oct 20 , 2010  .
i'll never buy archos again  .
within a year of launching the archos 605 , they quit support of the product before they worked all the bugs out  .
made you pay for subscription services they stopped providing  .
cannot upgrade firmware , so as internet protocols and plugins evolve , you're left with worthless hardware  .
loved my 605 for 2 months  .
now no better than an ipod shuffle at 5x the price  .
stay away from archos .
