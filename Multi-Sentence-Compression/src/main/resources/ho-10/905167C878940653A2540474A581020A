the location was the best part as you are 5 -10 min walk to the shore walk with stunning views of the opera house and downtown skyline , 15 min walk to milson 's point ferry and luna park , 10-15 min walk to the milson 's point train station , 10-15 min walk to the stairs leading up to the harbour bridge ( by the train station ) , less than 10 minutes to get to restaurants and shops .
