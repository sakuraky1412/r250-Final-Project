gatwick is lacking with true on site hotels - but the premier inn , as others have said , gives the big boys of hilton and sofitel a run for their money , at less than half the price .
£46 a night for 3 nights as a flexible rate , could have got £39 fixed - can not fault .
arrived at quiet time so easy access to reception , only 1 check in terminal working , but staff helped using laptop , took 5 mins - still quicker than hilton .
overall stay was good specifically : pros : - room spotless and very comfortable - smaller than usual pi but fine .
- great view of airport from 9th floor , window sealed but air con great .
- very handy for airport , better access than hilton .
- great prices , not as great as when hotel opened but still less than half the price of hilton / sofitel for a similar product .
- staff on the whole very helpful and assisted well - particularly in trying to organise people in and out of lift queues .
cons : - the lifts - sofitel have removed the need for swipe cards , pi should do the same .
lifts were fast but almost always full , swipe cards unreliable and general huge frustration - only 4 small lifts which do n't work effectively for a huge hotel not good , and no option of stairs as these are alarmed .
- wifi - 30 mins free a day - but would only work within a few feet from door - think sit on floor with back to the door and you 're ok - rest of room no signal .
- finally - usual premier inn issue - shower is restricted and very weak .
bath too small to be of any use .
observations : - did not use restaurant / bar - looked busy , london only 30 mins away and other towns near .
- fire alarm went off not long after we arrived - organisation seemed lacklustre , staff seemed to know it was a false alarm and behaved accordingly .
worryingly there is no map / plan of fire exits on back of room door , we had to ask a cleaner , who 'd not yet stopped work , where the fire exit was , it was not very clear .
on leaving the staff congregated under the mono-rail and customers wandered off to airport - no attempt was made to account for who had left .
in all - this premier inn is very good for a low cost airport hotel .
great location - just needs to sort out a few issues and the lifts and it will be 5* , it 's better now than the hilton , and not far off sofitel .
there is a bloc hotel due to open on site next - should be some good competition and great choice for travellers .
