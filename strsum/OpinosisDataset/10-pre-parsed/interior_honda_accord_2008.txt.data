solid build, comfortable interior, smooth ride, fuel efficient averaging 27 .

handles great, awesome fresh interior, lots of cool new features .

i hate to admit that they have loud interiors .

my only reservations are the ivory cloth interior's durability had to have taffeta white !

interior is good but has quite a few rattles .

interior is very comfortable w  ergonomic design in mind .
