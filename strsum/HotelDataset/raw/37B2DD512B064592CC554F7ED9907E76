the rating for this would be higher if it were not for unannounced construction work going on through 4 of our 7 day stay .
this was noisy and dusty and meant we could not sit in the non smoking area by the pool during our stay .
this aside , the hotel was nice and rooms had a nice balcony and were clean .
there is no air conditioning which is fine in april but would not be good in august !
the location is quite nice but is quiet and a bit far away from the main bar/ clubs section ( 20 mins walk+ ) .
we had all inclusive which was a nice buffet and most drinks ( not premium spirits or cocktails ) .
this was mostly good but did get very samey after a few days and we did eat out a couple of times to get a change .
the pools are a good size but were very cold in april .
the all inclusive stopped quite early in the evening ( 10 or 11pm i think ) but the bar was open later which i think is unfair .
you have to pay a deposit for towel hire by the pool and you only get half back at the end ( which was n't made clear ) .
the only other thing to mention is that we did not have a hairdryer in our room ( other guests did ) and it would have cost over 20 euros for the week to hire it which . . .

our lovely holiday rep leant us her spare so we did n't have to do this though .
overall a nice hotel but a few improvements could be made and do n't stay in the worse heat of the summer as would be unbearable without a/c !
