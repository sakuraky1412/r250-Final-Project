we stayed here for a few days and simply loved it .
a lovely hotel with a good location .
we had feared that the many nightclubs and bars fairly close by would cause a lot of late night noise , but hats off to the hotel building designers as we heard nothing of any noise from outside sources at night .
having the pool on top of the hotel is novel and means all day sun shine to get tanned on .
the local shops were great and if you do n't like experiment with localk food there is a m & s just across the road , which meant you could buy uk food / snacks etc .
the night life near to the hotel is very much 'alive ' and could apear intimidating to some , but as a couple in our 50 's we felt comfortable when walking through the younger people who were clubbing .
the nearby beach is clean and has private access for hotel patrons , and a short bus ride takes you along the coast route through sliema and on to valletta .
this is also a good walk during the day , or in the evenings ( to sliema and back ) and there are plenty shops and good eating places along the route .
closer to the hotel there is plenty to entertain all ages .
the hotel is what you would expect for a hotel of this stature , clean , quiet and fully equipped to meet patrons needs . 9 .
5/10 ( there 's always room . . .
