having looked at a number of reviews it is obvious that there is a problem with ventilation in many of the rooms since a number of people mention their rooms being too hot during their stay .
our room was unbearably hot and the window was open all night which had a little impact but nowhere near what you would expect since the weather outside was cool and windy .
the room itself was a decent size and nice , the ensuite showerroom adequate and the food for dinner and breakfast very good for the price we paid .
staff on reception and in the restaurant were very friendly and helpful to us at all times .
i saw other people getting ratty over what i would consider minor things , but without knowing their circumstances i ca n't say whether they were right to be annoyed .
to me having to ask about parking and wait for breakfast tables in a busy hotel are not worth getting upset about , but that is the kind of issues that i saw being made a fuss over .
we did not use the spa .
the hot tub is small so you do n't go in if a couple are in there already which was the case when we looked in .
if you want a real spa break this might not be the best choice .
if you want a good base for the night , reasonable food and friendly staff then i can vouch . . .

if you want a good base for the night , reasonable food and friendly staff then i can vouch for that being what is offered here at a value for money price with the offers available .
the heating issue needs to be resolved , but it will be less of a problem during the winter months i suspect.
