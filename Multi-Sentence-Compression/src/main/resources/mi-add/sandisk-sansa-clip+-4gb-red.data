this review does not do the sansa clip + justice  .
for the audiobook listeners out there , let me point out that it bookmarks anything you have in the audiobook folder (not the music folder) so that you can easily switch back and forth between your books and your music  .
it also has a sleep timer which is awesome if you fall asleep listing at night  .
it has a progressive fast forward which is essential if you listen to audiobooks alot  .
i've had several mp3 players and this is the best by a mile .
i bought it to replace ipod nano 4th generation and from the day i got it in my hands i did not touched my nano  .
though this player is not available in my country i arranged it from a friend abroad and it is worth the effort  .
i have used many mp3 players (ipod shuffle , creative zen stone , ipod touch , ipod nano) but this is far far better than all of them put together shuffle    blind  .
creative zen stone    too slow menu/songs navigation  .
touch    poor sound quality  .
ipod nano    can make you deaf (click wheel    accidental volume increase)  .
no custom eq , cant delete music from within player , average sound , etc  .
perfect gym companion  .
compact and comfortable to carry anywhere no worries of screen scratching no fear to hand it to over to kids no need of hip and hand belts i have used this player lot lot more than the expensive fancy players i have owned for quite long most useful electronic product i ever bought , next to my laptop though ; )  .
i've already said it all .
i love this device  .
paired with some good headphones , the audio quality blows away the competition  .
the microsd card slot lets you expand the storage to an acceptable amount for even large libraries  .
very small and light .
i just bought this a few days ago and love it  .
the sound is great after working the eq and its a nice fit for the gym  .
the best feature though is that i can transfer all of my rhapsody songs with out buying them  .
this music player is perfect for people who want a small , cheap , convenient device  .
right out of the box , it's so easy to use and understand  .
the mini    usb connection is very generic ; it accepts any mini    usb cord for the computer and wall plugs and charges both ways moving music and audio books onto the device is very quick and the device refreshes the song list in seconds  .
it's also generic in music programs ; you can use just about any program to move music or just move the folders the device has many , many settings that you can tweak to your preference , including back light , brightness , and power saving  .
there's also an equalizer built in  .
reaching and changing playback modes from the playing song screen is quick to understand and use every part of this music player is absolutely wonderful and it's a delight to use .
i really like the sansa clip+ because it's so light you don't know you have it clipped to you  .
i is surprised by the sound quality is is very good but then i did add my good quality sony headphones  .
i didn't need video capacity so this suits me fine  .
if i'd needed video i would have bought the sansa fuze which is similar the clip+ does not come with complex software , you just use your explorer on your pc to drop and drag files  .
files can be deleted directly from the player (not like ipods which need itunes to delete files) the fm radio works well and stations are very easily added  .
everything about this little player is so cool    my husband keeps leaving his ipod classic at home and stealing my clip because it's so great to use when you exercise  .
if you're walking or running there's no added weight so it's not annoying  .
i think it weighs less than 1 oz  .
9 of an oz from memory)  .
the clip has a special audiobooks section which i use a lot because this is my main reason for purchasing it  .
when you pause a book and go back to it , you have the option of continuing from where you left off or starting from the beginning the clip can have micro sdhc cards added which would be great on long trips so that you could store lots of books ready to read whenever you want , or music for that matter  .
it also takes slot radio cards which hold about 1000 songs each in a different genre the online manual is substantial and very clear  .
all in all there's not much to dislike about the sansa clip+  .
i'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting a tiny , light mp3 player without video .
i wanted an mp3 player mainly for listening to music while at the gym or exercising in general  .
this one is perfect for that  .
, my old mp3 player is a toshiba gigabeat and it is much larger and heavier , but played videos (but i never really used it for that anymore)  .
the clip+'s small size and almost non    existant weight are perfect for working out  .
you do not even know it's there  .
i've had it for a few months now and have had no problems loading music or charging it , etc  .
my old player used mediaplayer for syncing , so everything is already set up when i started using this player  .
sound is good (even on my cheap headphones) and there are several eq options  .
the golist is the ability to add any song to a impromptu playlist that is saved on the player  .
my gigabeat had a similar function that i loved , so i is really glad to see that on here as well  .
the ability to make on    a    whim playlists is excellent  .
i also plan on buying a 16 gb microsd card , giving me a total size of 20gb  .
you cannot beat that for ~$80  .
this player is the perfect alternative since i no longer needed a movie player , i really only use it at the gym , and i is looking for a bargain .
easiest mp3 player to flip thru tunes while working out , great sound quality , it's so small , cheap price  .
the sound is fantastic  .
i have several mp3 players and none sound as good as this one  .
i have a apple iphone , the latest one out , and the sound does not come close to the sound on this little gem  .
it is totally shocking how good this little thing sounds  .
it is so easy to put music on  .
it has several folders to hold other data such as photos and audio books  .
with the option to expand the memory it can store a ton of music and other information  .
i highly recommend this mp3 player and can assure you , you will not be disappointed  .
i have let several friends check it out and they all say their more expensive players do not sound that good  .
the price is a steal and the headphones are comfortable  .
i will be buying couple more of these players so my family can stop borrowing mine cnet''s review is extremely accurate  .
i recently purchased a set of headphones for $179  .
00 on sale and the quality of these little headphones that comes with the sansa clip + is better  .
i will be taking these more expensive one back for a refund .
my 2nd gen shuffle died after about 2 years of use (mostly at the gym) and i is looking for a replacement  .
i looked at the 3rd gen shuffle but is really turned off by the fact that you have to use their earphones (i like my shure headphones) and also the small buttons are located on the earphones themselves (annoying)  .
so i opted for the 8gb version of this model and i am very glad i did  .
it gives you tremendous value for the price (with fm radio , tons of storage) and no doubt apple will have to change their future shuffles to compete  .
i highly recommend this item it's a great stocking stuffer too  .
the clip is the answer to the question why carry multiple electronic devices  .
the clip plus is the ideal mp3 playing device , and that's all it does .
the sound quality is excellent  .
audiophiles use the clip and the clip+ because it has such great sound  .
the clip+ can play back flac files which are lossless audio files  .
the clip+ also plays back ogg vorbis files for all you linux hippies the clip+ volume does not go low enough  .
i sometimes like to listen to the radio before i go to sleep and the volume level starts out too high on radio  .
i'm sure engineers at sandisk are furiously hacking away trying to solve my little problem it has a clip built in  .
i used to have a dlo action jacket on my sansa e260 so that i could clip the player to my shirt now the clip+ comes with a clip i have a pair of sennheiser cxl 400 headphones  .
these headphones have a built in lanyard and can be found cheap on the internet because of their unusual design  .
i have my clip+ hanging from my headphones and it works perfectly i love my clip+ if you go to buy it at best buy you will need some assistance finding the sansas they hide them on a dark isle at knee height  .
i think they get better commission selling the useless ipod shuffle .
the product looks funky , has ease of use and is amazing value compared to another popular ipod of which i have 3  .
invariably i will return to the sandisk clip as its more user friendly  .
(and it is far less money  .
why am i on my 3rd one , you may ask  .
it is not because of a product defect  .
i keep destroying the dang thing  .
the main reason i bought it is because i needed a shuffle without paying hundreds of $$ to revive my library  .
the unit is durable (although it wo not make it through a riding mower , yes twice)  .
i have dropped this thing many times , stepped on it in the floor of the car , had it ripped off my shoulder by a tree while skiing and it keeps going  .
i think i would like the shuffle just as well , but i like the little screen to build playlists on the fly  .
hey , for the $$ , it is hard to beat , unless you are a die    hard ipod fan  .
my 2 cents .
well worth the money  .
lots of great features  .
i especially like the built    in custom equalizer you can also select from several preset eq settings if you do not want to take the time to manually adjust the sound quality  .
fm radio and voice recording is a nice touch  .
bright , easy to read screen (indoors anyway outdoors , a bit harder but not impossible to read , and you can adjust the brightness settings if needed)  .
it is also very easy , no    hassle experience to plug into the computer and upload music  .
expandable memory is a huge plus (not sure of the limit , but adding an 8gb micro sd card to make it 12gb overall gives you enough space for roughly 2000 tunes) before purchasing the clip + , i tested four larger players in the same price category , but wound up returning them all due to various quality issues  .
some were off    brands , some not  .
i've only had it for a few days now , but i'm confident in saying that the clip is a keeper  .
i'm simply blown away that such a small player can pack such a mighty punch  .
great job , san disk  .
on saturday i went to best buy to buy this  .
the mp3 player table did not have the clip+ on display , so i asked if they had it  .
they did , but it is tucked under the table , locked away  .
i got the 4gb black one to compliment my jvc marshmallows  .
the total cost is $60   $40 for the player and $20 for the headphones the first thing i tried out is the fm radio  .
it could be better , doesn't have good reception inside buildings , and terrible reception in my room  .
oh well , i bought it for the player  .
so after that , i tried the voice recording  .
it's okay , but if you move it too much you'll get clicking noises , and it ruins the quality i plugged in the clip's short cable to the computer and started syncing it  .
i haven't used any programs yet , just old explorer  .
exe  .
it works like a charm  .
i do have problems syncing one song though , but i think it might have something to do with the way i took it off my old ipod i plugged in my 'mallows and listened to my music  .
i have not tried ogg vorbis or flac yet , but it does well playing mp3s and wmas  .
in fact , it does better than the ipod over all , this player is a great product at a great price  .
i strongly recommend this over any other player .
best player available , especially for any minimalists like myself  .
i especially appreciate that no annoying software is necessary  .
just plug in and copy your stuff over  .
display is small but gets the job done wonderfully and displays everything essential very light and small  .
can be upgraded to (20gb) with a 16gb microsd card  .
(i believe it supports 16gb cards)  .
fm tuner is a great bonus love this thing and what a great price updated  .
on sep 17 , 2010  .
i bought this as a gift from my own mother after reading the reviews online , and after getting her all squared away with it , i had to buy one for myself  .
it's an excellent compliment to my zunehd  .
the clip+ is a bit more workout friendly , thanks to its lightweight compact body and built    on clip  .
it's great for anyone that wants a simple music player it's battery lasts long enough for a trip from the midwest to south korea , including a couple 2    hour layovers , with enough juice to last into the next morning (so roughly , 25    30 hrs)  .
4gb is a nice start , but once i found out it'll work with zune pass subscription music (not automatic , have to import libraries through windows media player) , i immediately wanted more space  .
thankfully , the microsd slot let me throw in another 8gb it's very solidly built  .
i've dropped it a few times , tossed it carelessly into a number of bags , and even sent it through the wash , yet it still keeps on ticking the only gripes i have with it are its screen and the shuffle option  .
the oled screen is very nice on a pmp like the zunehd , but on a compact player like this , it's difficult to read the menus while outdoors  .
as for setting music to shuffle , i've gotten used the the option being presented directly from the playback screen on other pmps , that having navigate through menus in the settings option is a bit of a downer oddly enough , i liked the stock earbuds  .
they sound much better than any other stocks i've ever used  .
had it not been for the fact i proudly own a pair of koss portapros , i probably would use them all in all , it is a very excellent music player i can easily recommend to anyone looking from something compact and simple to use  .
its no    frills design is very practical , and as long as you do not fiddle too much with it outdoors , i'm sure anyone out there will be pleased with it .
great little device definitely the number 1 travel mp3 player or replacement for an ipod out there , packed with features  .
screen is a little cramped and screen quality is not impressive but its cheap and nifty  .
great buy  .
i use mine for listening to the radio or tunes when i walk the dog and do yard work , and only need to charge it once a week  .
i use this thing every day and love it  .
it is my favorite new toy  .
i take it everywhere with me  .
i love it  .
i did get a scratch on the face and kind of wish i had bought the face covers , but it is a cosmetic scratch and doesn't interfere with reading the screen  .
the earphones that come with it are good  .
it is so lightweight that i carry it by the earphone cord (occasionally) and it is not heavy enough to stress the cord  .
i've had it for a few months and still love it completely i haven't used all of it's features yet , but i look forward to trying them all  .
i did not give it a full 5 stars , just because of the charging time and my frustration with the trials  .
you do not need to sign up for them to be able to use the player and i thought that i had to sign up for them  .
you can use it immediately with the radio and by loading your own cd's on to it before you venture into downloading from the internet .
high quality player for low price , great rma service , though having the clip suddenly break is concerning and makes me feel the player needs to be babied  .
very worth    while purchase  .
simple good sound for a small price  .
would recommend this to anyone  .
i put in 8gb micro which gives this matchbox size player 10 gb  .
updated  .
on mar 1 , 2010  .
great sound  .
i guess that is the bottom line .
i wanted a simple player and the inclusion of a fm radio put this mp3 player over the top  .
it is easy to drag and drop my files to the device .
an excellent , low    cost player .
overall this is the best mp3 player i've used in a long time  .
the screen is not even the slightest bother since it's meant to be a clip mp3 player (usually not paying attention to the music)  .
this has a very nice display and the clip stays on clothes perfectly  .
the micro sd card slot makes this an even bigger bargain , as a 16 gb micro sd is only 30    $50 so you can have a player with about 20 gigs of music (more than an ipod nano)  .
the go list lets you quickly select songs and does not make it so you have to bother making a separate playlist on your computer  .
this is an amazing mp3 player and i would recommend it to anybody .
it's a great player at this price point , certainly better than an ipod shuffle at any price  .
sound quality is excellent , being able to use up to 16gb sdhc card is great  .
it's easy to use even when not looking at it  .
it also is loud too    good for a noisy environment .
i believe you get more than what you pay for , for 40$ you get a durable limited function mp3 player that is pretty good at what it's supposed to do  .
it may not have all the eye candy and aesthetic design of an ipod , but it also does not have the price tag and does essentially the same thing  .
records nicely as i use it to record lectures sometimes  .
mp3 , voice recorder , fm player , and a storage device , it's as simple as that .
i wish sansa had worked more on improving the quality and design of the clip attachment itself  .
i had lost mine and had tried to replace it through sansa's customer service , but they told me that the warranty on my clip is only applicable to the device itself , and that the clip attachment is an accessory and is not covered under a warranty i found that to be ridiculous  .
i would think that sansa would make the clip attachment sturdier since it is the main feature of the clip  .
i had also tried to buy the clip replacements of their website as a ridiculously expensive $15 for a 3    pack , but they were back ordered for months (which i'm sure is not true , they were probably so overwhelmed by the number of people who had lost/broken the clip due to the poor design that they didn't have enough in stock to replace them all) i am so glad that the new clip+ comes with a sturdier non    removable clip  .
this will make my search for the perfect player complete , since now i wo not have to worry about the losing the clip  .
i cannot wait to get my hands on it  .
overall , this device is awesome  .
and at the prices they go for , it's definitely worth it  .
updated  .
on sep 25 , 2009  .
i bought this player for the gym , which its perfect for  .
its incredibly light so you barely know its on you (a good when exercising) , and it's clipable  .
the ergonomics are fantastic   the buttons are small but logically laid out and clear to use  .
for such a feature    paced player , i applaud sandisk for their menu system , which is pretty good even on this small device (small screen , small buttons)  .
despite the small screen , it's very bright and colorful (has a nice blue hue)  .
for a gym player , this is ideal , but i think it would even be a good choice for somebody who wants just a basic mp3 player unknowns    .
quality    though initial quality is very good , i do not know how it will hold up long    term  .
this mp3 player is what it says it is , a player  .
it does not have all the video , picture , and whatever other options  .
therefore , it is a small , very light weight object  .
and , even better , its menu is simple and uncluttered because it has a clip on the back , it is very easy to be mobile  .
i often will clip it to the back of my shirt and bundle the earphone cord and listen while i am working  .
this keeps the player and its cord from getting in my way while i actively use my hands and arms i am also thrilled with the amount of memory it has  .
it is more then enough for many hours of listening  .
it is easy to download music to the player , too  .
it came with a software disk , but i never used it  .
i found that the good old fashion drag and drop works great to add a song or two  .
when i want to add a larger group of songs , i sync them right from my media player on my pc the only thing i would like to see different , would be that it would have the ability to have its battery charged while away from the computer  .
even though i would call this a con , it is not too bad because it has a great battery life .
for what i want , a simple easy to use small functional design to llisten to audilbe boods an some music when i work out or walk or travel , the sansa clip is my favorite  .
i prefer ti tto the many other players i have had  .
best is that for me , players nevelr last that long    6months to a year at best , adn the sandisk is the least expensive and as reliable as most and les complcated .
this is an awesome player but it could be better in the two areas id'ed in the cons  .
you know cnet , it'd be nice to have someone write a product review who's used the product for more than a few minutes  .
the reviewer should've written about what you're seeing here       when biking and playing tennis , the wired earbuds are in the way  .
it's nearly 2010 , why is not bluetooth a standard feature by now  .
(most likely answer , battery power depletion , but still ) second , i've got several music playlists on it but when it plays the final song of a playlist it wo not automatically proceed to the next playlist  .
i have to stop what i'm doing to manually select the playlist and start play on it  .
what's that about  .
these are minor aggravations but overall it's a recommended product to have .
i bought one of these players (4gb) for both myself and my wife , for $40 at amazon  .
com  .
there were several purposes for which the player has served well  .
first off , both my wife and i typically use our phones for mp3 players , for a number of reasons , however , when i broke the headphone jack on my phone (don't ask how , cause i don't know , and i am glad my contract is up , cept i don't know what to get now , with rumors of the nexus one)  .
anyways , enough of that tangent  .
so i needed something to listen to my daily smattering of podcasts , again , which i had been using my phone for  .
also , i couldn't leave my wife with out a little toy for her , so i got one for her , especially since i thought it would be nicer for her to use while running (althogh when we get those nexus ones , she will probably get some run tracking app and then just want to take the phone)  .
so that is kind of the point , is that these players probably wo not end up being our daily players , but they are excellent stand    ins for great value i knocked off half a star for the absolutly horrid handling of podcasts  .
it is so ackward skipping back and forth , as it always returns you to the point to which you left the podcast , rather than the beginning  .
maybe that is what most people want , but at least there should be some menu options associated with that  .
also , pausing and exiting the podcasts and then going back to the menu , and then hitting play , starts music , not the podcast  .
that is awful in my oppinion , but livable for the interim for the price the second half star off is for the poor menu options in general  .
no option to show time remaining , total track time , etc  .
i know the screen is small , but they could still make these options available the third half star off is for the poor stock earbuds  .
i know all stock earbuds are bad , but these were really bad  .
i had to use them cause i had not brought our earphones , because i had purchased these right before we left for a vacation and just forgot to pack them so we had to use the stock earbuds  .
the wire on mine broke at the y on the third day again , i would say this player is a great back    up/travel/excercise/sports player  .
plus its size and battery life make it not so bad to carry an additional item .
i've had both items and is much more impressed by the simplicity and the great price of the cube mp3 player , which i found on www  .
justdeals  .
com  .
great product for people that requires music and music only with great quality  .
also not vry expensive  .
but the wmp and filemanagement is i cannot find any more nice words for it .
if you value fm on a device , do not go for this one  .
if you are more interested in loading songs it is well worth the pricetag .
i bought one and had it for about a month and the volume stoped working , so i bought a new one and after 3 weeks it flaked , it completely died  .
i tried everything but it just wont work  .
its crap  .
stay with apple  .
unless you want to return return return until you give up .
this is the second sansa product i've owned and both have died within a year the last one , the sandisk , did not even make it five months will not buy another sansa again .
get another brand if you do not want to drive yourself crazy .
this thing is not meant to be used while doing any kind of activities  .
it cannot be used for jogging (which is primarily what i bought it for) because any kind of movement will cause it to stop playing and send it into refreshing you media mode  .
i gave up on using this player for running  .
worse than the problems i encountered while running is the fact that it does the same thing when i walk my dogs  .
any movement at all will send this into that same refresh mode  .
sometimes the refresh mode can take up to 10 minutes and while it does no music or radio can be played  .
although the sound quality is great , that does not really matter if no music can be played  .
i contacted the sandisk tech support to ask about this problem and the reply is it should not be doing that  .
maybe you should try removing all the music you loaded (1 , 000 plus songs) and then reload them  .
no offer to replace this player is made and when i asked if sandisk would replace it i is told by the tech support person that's not possible  .
unless you have the time to listen to this player while sitting still with the player lying on a table in front of you without moving it at all , then i would pass on this product  .
obviously cnet does not test these products under real world conditions .
jasmine france   the cnet reviewer , did a crappy job of reviewing this product i bought the 8gb version  .
first , be aware that this is 8 10^9 bytes instead of the preferable 8 2^30 bytes , so it does not hold a much as a computer programmer tends to expect i quickly (over a couple of hours) slapped about 7gb of data onto the player  .
when i removed it from my computer , it hung  .
while trying to understand why , i had to remove all data from the system and try reloading it piece by piece  .
a couple hour later , it still hung when unplugged from the computer  .
i did a web search to understand why and eventually found a 'diskutil' application on my mac that ran an fsck (file system check) on the clip's filesystem  .
that did the trick and cleaned up the clip to the point where it would play two days later it stopped playing again complaining the filesystem is overly full  .
(nothing is added to the clip during this time  .
) i plugged the clip into my mac , ran the cleaner , and could listen to music again  .
my non    technical wife is unable to use the clip until i came home from work and spent 5 minutes screwing around with the product  .
this cleaning step appears to be necessary every two days this morning i picked up the clip and turned it on  .
it took two minutes before the clip booted to the point that it would display the main menu .
bottom line is that she is returning it tomorrow for a model (better brand name) that costs only $20 more , allows you to change the  rechargeable  batteries and actually comes with more features  .
had i known this is only a limited use mp3 player    i would  not  have purchased it , nor would i ever recommend it to anyone  .
i'm actually in agreement with her as this being too much of a throw    a    way nation  .
corporate entities need to get the dollar signs out of their eyes and stop making so many disposable things to be perfectly honest    i had always relied on cnet when considering a purchase  .
however , now i'm a bit skeptical  .
both my wife and i are in complete disbelief that this product actually has cnet editors' choice (aug 2009) stamped on the box  .
if you're going to post a review on a product    please , in the future    post a  thorough  review so that people know what they are  really  buying before making a wasted trip and end up being disappointed  .
not one single review i had come across stated that the battery cannot be replaced  .
it is is  very  fine print on the back of the box again , the only features she did like were the color , the incredible sound quality and formats available another con to this product/company is that they are far too cheap to include a full instructional booklet within the box  .
you have to visit their website for the entire users manual (we're both wondering if this is their way into suckering consumers into purchasing a pre    loaded music card that will ultimately be useless when the unit conks out or    if and when the model is discontinued)  .
my wife quite literally wasted hours compiling her song and audio book lists before realizing this is a throw    a    way item unless you literally have money to throw away    do not buy this one .
i believed this is great budget mp3 player , then i read some reviews saying this product has a tendency to just fail  .
i thought ok i'll buy it ppl online are usually complainers anyways  .
turns out everyone is right on the money  .
i bought the sansaclip at radio shack for 39  .
99 , after 28 days and approximately 10 uses (estimating each time to be about 30    60 minutes) the mp3 just died with full battery life for the life of me i could not get it to turn back on even after trying to charge it again , etc , etc i ended up exchanging it for another sansaclip thinking i just got a lemon , the next one last two weeks and about 3 uses and it did exactly the same thing  .
in the middle of a song , just died would not turn back on even after doing the 20 second thing , charging , shaking , crying and screaming at it absolutely nothing is making it work again so i returned it this is a bad investment product and i do not recommend .
i bought this product in mid    march  .
it took a lot of doing for it to play podcasts in playlists , but i finally figured it out (you need to change the tag)  .
it had an annoying habit of shutting off by itself every few days , but it always came back on  .
this morning it shut off by itself , i turned it back on , and 10 minutes later it died  .
power button does nothing , plugging in the usb cable does nothing    just nothing  .
at least it is still in warranty (i think)  .
i guess my bottom line is that this player stopped functioning an hour and a half after i took it out of the package  .
i'm not sure if that is due to the problem with the small connector on the usb cable and if it became damaged while i is connecting it  .
i think i basically got a substandard product yes , the sound , or what i heard of it , is very nice  .
unfortunately , the unit i bought is very poorly put together  .
the headphone jack/headphone plug were badlly fitted  .
if headphone plug is pushed all the way in , no sound  .
if it is pulled out slightly , got sound but it cut out player is moved  .
use this for sports  .
i do not think so the manual claims the player supports audiobook files  .
this is not the case  .
i tried loading a spoken word cd both through a music program and directly from the disc and the files were not read by the player although they appeared to be there when the unit is connected to my computer but the file appeared empty when it is disconnected i'm at a loss to understand the discrepancy between the over    the    top wonderful reviews this product has garnered versus my experience with the one i purchased  .
at least i can still get my money back .
You can transfer songs from your Rhapsody Account, Price, Style, Sound; I can't find any yet
Threre's nothing really to add from the review.; 1. No Bluetooth, and. 2. No Continuous-Playlist Play
Good quality, good ergonomics, multiple color choices, small but bright screen; Sound quality is average, awkward headphone jack placement
size. clip. screen! (thats why no shuffle for me). mini USB charging. decent enough battery life for me (15 hrs). playlist support!; on screen display not really customizable (I prefer time remaining on songs, or at least total time and time elapsed). poor podcast handling. super cheap included earbuds
Good sound quality, easy software navigation.; Any movement at all will send the player into "Refreshing your media" mode. Cannot be used for jogging or even walking.
good quality music, very fast navigation, easy to understand, cheap price, clip feature and small size, mini-USB connection, international language support, FM radio; no cons so far
Small size. FM radio. Storage Capacity. PRICE!!; Only fault I found is it is cumbersome to drag and drop songs as I like itunes functionality way better when creating and editing play lists.
Price, Easy to use, FM Radio; Menu not as intuitive as other MP3 players. Radio doesn't receive all the stations that I can at my home, but does when I'm outside.
Easy to use and understand. FM Radio. Small in size.; The fact that it just stopped working. The only way to charge was have computer on and this plugged into USB port.
-Small size makes it easier to clip to, say, belt loop. -Amazing compatibility. -Price is unbeatable. -Many features; -Transition from iPod will take a couple of days. -Battery life could be better. -included headphones aren't great. -FM radio isn't great
Easy music management from any computer or OS. Simple interface. Excellent sound quality. Wide range of supported audio formats. Nice OLED display. MicroSD slot for add-on memory is great!; Audio output is a bit anemic; greatly benefits from a headphone amplifier. FM radio and other features are superfluous.
True story, came back from the gym, by accident it ended up in laundry basket, went thru entire wash cycle, thought I ruined it, a day later works perfectly. Like Timex, it keeps on ticking, try that with an Apple product.; Wish somebody would sell a quality arm band for the gym.
Its got a large memory for a small price; the cube is cheaper and you can put in an mini sd card in it
it was easy to use and just the right size; it is a piece of crap
Extremely light and small.. Clips on to what you're wearing - great for exercise. Great sound. Bookmarks audiobooks easily. Micro SD/SDHC cards - to provide more memory. FM Radio. Easy to use. Good online manual. Dan delete files from player; Headphones packaged with player are not that good.
- supports microsd upto 32gb. - can delete media from within the player unlike ipods. - small size, clip. - solid sound quality, custom equalizer. - podcast / audiobooks/ audible support. - cheap; - no stopwatch. - may take some time to refresh data if you have higher capacity card but that's probably due to read speed of memory card. ( i am using 16gb)
Lightweight &#38; compact; very easy to pick up and go; decent battery life; expandable memory/Slot Radio; solidly built; integrated clip; FM radio; price; decent EQ settings; stock earbuds not bad too bad; works w/ Zune Pass; Screen is a little hard to read outdoors; can not set to shuffle from playback screen
Excellent Sound Quality, Compact, the Clip, easy menu, folder + artist view, easy songs transfer - no softwares, good looking, extendable memory, Simple operation, Easy-confident on-off button, continues where u left a song on switching on, etc. etc.; Nothing at all... hmmm... you might need a better headphones to enjoy the real sound quality the device produces.
Small, clip feature (clip holds really well and doesn't bounce around), can change songs by feel when running/biking/skiing, great sound quality. Cheap.; Will not survive being run over by my riding lawn mower. (Personally, I think the engineers need to work on this one.)
Cheap, expandable memory, good sound quality, small, rational design, builld quality of "Plus" is better than original Clip, appears as external hard drive-allowing "drag and drop" file loading; So small that it is easy to misplace.
Many well designed, and readily accessible features on this little dynamo. Sound quality is excellent, with noticibly good separation. I was pleasantly surprised by what I got. And all at a great price.; At the moment, I have none.
Sound was nice for the 60 seconds or so I heard it.; Small connector on USB cable did not fit the player properly. Almost had to jam it in because it was badly sized.. Player does not support audiobook or spoken word files. But the manual claims it does!. This section is not big enough for all issues!
Easy to use, lightweight, works well. It is my first MP3 player (I'm 35) and I have little trouble using it. Well worth the money!; It came with free trial memberships to download music and those were miserable to use. It takes a couple of hours to charge.
Small size and light weight, easy to load/unload songs, pretty good battery life, "golist", exandable memory; navigation can be a little tricky at first since there's very few buttons, but you get used to it quickly. No wall charger (but it charges pretty quickly off of USB)
headphones superior to my recently purchased walmart phillps (11$)expandable mini SD slot potential to become up to a 16gb MP3 player. belt clip is sturdy, music transfers quickly, nice recorder, Superior battery life; Using windows media player to sync your files is a pain sometimes(does not update folders quickly so you have to manually search in your files), no volume controls on the head phones,
Sleep timer! Bookmarking! Awesome sound. Feather light and has a clip for easy carrying. Progressive fast forward and the controls actually work well! Best MP3 player out there for audiobooks.; You MUST download the latest firmware update on the SanDisk website to ge the bookmarking to work right. If you don't, it won't let you transfer audiobooks into the audiobook folder on the player unless they are Audible downloads.
Simplicity and easy functionality. Product quality over complex design and lots of unnecessary bells adn whistles. Can use without looking at it and it clips on to my workout tee shirt or lapel or front pocket so don't have to hold or have long wires; With Sansa, it seems I have to reformat too often as my audible books are replaced but don't come off the play list and jam up the HD.
The sansa clip+ is a step up from the first one clip, which was already amazing. It has a new folder view, is only $50 for a 4 gb player, and plays a diverse amount of formats along with great quality.; Other than not playing AAC this player has no cons, a 15 hour battery life is over half a day, good enough for me.
This little device is everything I need in an Mp3 player. Portability, functionality, simplicity, and affordability. I bought the Clip because it fit my needs the most, small, great sound quality, bright LCD screen, easy navigation, and cheap.; HUGE Con- Design of clip attachment flimsy and easy to lose/break.
Great sound quality, crisp clear sound, especially with good headphones/earbuds (not the ones that come with it). very easy to use, almost as easy as an ipod. MicroSDHC card slot is very useful i use an 8gb card with my 4gb clip+.; a physical lock button would be nice but thats a very minor niggle for a device this cheap.
Very nice and small only MP3 player plus radio. With sound quality is the top choice for people who dont want such unnecessary features like video on small displays.; what I really really really do not like about Sansa is the usage of Windows Media Player, very bad file managemenet and very very very bad playlists management. This cutted two stars from my review. Absolutely dissapointing.
Has a well made look and feel. Sound quality is excellent using the ear buds that shipped with it.. Gets incredible radio reception.; More of a comment on Rhapsody... the Clip+ comes with a Rhapsody CD. Once installed , Rhapsody is asking you to set up an account. You DO NOT have to sign up with Rhapsody to use the player for your own music.
Small with a lot of space available. Mic and FM radio.; I am on my 2nd Clip in 2 weeks. The quality of the inner workings are in question at this point. I had the First Generation Clip before and it lasted a long time. I decided to stay with Sansa but I think they released the Clip + before it was ready.
Its a very good product for a tiny price. Using it for power-walking I forget it is on my waist as its so compact. Majority of my music has been downloaded to it and its a pleasure to listen too, as songs I haven't heard for ages suddenly play!; Having to charge on my computer , the battery life.
user friendly. Does not waste battery life on anything unnecessary. Incredibly small and light; perfect for running with. No annoying software, just plug in and copy over. Display is the perfect size. FM Tuner is a great bonus; Battery life could be slightly longer. It lasts about 1-2 days with moderate use. Not bad by any means but could be better. Also the battery is irremovable so if it goes out you must replace the entire unit. USB cord could be longer.
It's small but not too small. It has a Screen Unlike the shuffle. It has Buttons unlike the shuffle. You can mount it in MSC (hard drive) mode or MTP and sync it with Windows Media Player, Media Monkey, and winamp.. It has fantastic sound quality.. CHEAP!; I use my clip+ to play podcasts and I like to listen to them in Chronological order. I had to do some fancy stuff to Media Monkey so that the player would play back the files the right way.. http://www.anythingbutipod.com/forum/showthread.php?t=48100
Great sound, great feature set for player this small. Love using it when running, driving (with it clipped to my seatbelt chest strap, or recording lectures at University.; Would be nice if time/date could be displayed (perhaps when pushing the center button). The clip broke off of the player after 8 months, but the RMA coverage from San Disk is great and I had it replaced within 7 business days.
ease of use,like the drop and drag, i. I use mine in the gym does not get in the way just clip to your shirt and go to work. Has a great sound even with the ear plugs supplied with it. you have 4gb of space @ micro sd for more space under 50.00!!; so small guess you could mis place it.
Great interface, intuitive use, nice matte finish on back and glossy curved edges around the small device. Dont use the clip on feature that much but this thing is a perfect to take on trips. Really like the fact that it has SD card capabilities.; -cheap feel to the directional buttons, and a bit to light for my taste. -sometimes you have to go through excessive motions to get to the song you want, and unlike the ipod you have to go to the actual song playing and press pause to stop the music.
Great sound quality, for the size and price, excellent. 5 band equalizer, high volume.; there is a manufacturer's defect in the headphone jack that not long after you own it you have to jiggle the metal in the headphone jack to get sound out of both sides, have had 3 Sansa Clip + models, the orginal Clip had much better quality .
Size: easy to stash.. Clip: great for exercising.. Features: many for such a small player (as many as the larger players I tested).. Sound quality: great.; Size: due to it's matchbox size it's kind of awkward holding it in the palm of my hand and pressing buttons with my thumb on the same hand...not impossible, just takes getting used to after having a larger player.
I have had mine over a year now and I am very happy with it. This player has everything I want in a player. It is simple to use and very portable. I love the clip. I love its small size. It is a great player for those that want just a player.; The only thing I would change if I could, is that, it needs to be connected to a computer via its USB port to charge the battery.
Sound quality is fantastic. Its as good or better than more higher priced MP3 players. Battery life is no problem. Headphones are comfortable. More bass and good treble sound. Can clip it just about any where for ease of use.; Truly haven't found any yet. Its easy to charge. Have read that people wish the charge lasted longer but not a problem for me.
I bought this model (after much research) for her birthday - which was just yesterday. The only three things that she actually liked about it was the color (I bought her black), the incredible sound quality and formats available.; MAJOR CON: Again - to quote my wife: "What is the POINT in buying electronics when you can't even replace the battery when it dies?! Recycling is a scam and this is too much of a "throw-a-way nation as it is. " Her rant did not end there.
Compact size, clip feels solid, very easy to set up and get music onto device. The device feels solid and well made and for the price, it is a very good deal. Perfect starting MP3 for someone and great for kids.; FM reception is spotty. With headphones (as the 'antennae') reception faded in and out (all that static and scratchy stuff) and got louder/softer from movement to movement. Very disappointed as FM was one of the main reasons I bought this device.
