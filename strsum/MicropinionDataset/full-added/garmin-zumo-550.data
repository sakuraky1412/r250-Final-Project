knowing what i know now through first hand experience , if i had to do it all over again , i would  .
i would also highly recommend this unit to anyone who can afford it  .
you will be glad you did .
i have another older garmin that i use for sailing and flying  .
it is very easy to import all my routes and waypoints from it  .
i have a bluetooth headset in my helmet and it connected with no problems  .
it also connected with my blackberry and even had my complete dialing address book available to me on the gps screen i'm used to gpss that don't come with everything so i bought a lot of the accessories  .
the ad should list what comes with it  .
perhaps it is an oversight of the online vendor (amazon)  .
i do not know .
this is the 3rd garmin gps i have owned over the past 10 years  .
it is also the best motorcycle unit out there it is designed with bikers in mind  .
easy to use is an understatement  .
you can figure this thing out in about 15 minutes as close to perfect as possible .
i love this unit  .
it has all the features i wanted in a gps and will be the standard to beat for a long time  .
all these great features in one unit  .
wow  .
navigate , listen to your favorite music , call up a friend from your phones address book right there on your unit  .
touch screen just about everything with gloves on  .
no problem viewing this in direct sunlight either  .
and you don't miss a thing  .
product support is great too  .
somehow i lost my maps when updating the software and a call to garmin had an update dvd on its way to me 2nd day air  .
they would have updated it immediately online if i had broadband  .
buy this and you wo not be disappointed .
you can use it in a car or your motorcycle  .
i give it a on scale from 1 to 10 a 10  .
it tells you if you are low on fuel  .
it tells you how far to your destination , how many miles and the eta  .
it tells you if you are going north , south , west or east  .
slide an sd card and you can hear music while on your motorcycle with the correct helmet you can recieve or make calls  .
it has so many features , i love it .
easy to use and understand right out of the box  .
lots of accesseries for car and cycle  .
a must have .
i've owned many gps's some aftermarket , some included with my car  .
when i went shopping fora gps for my motorcycle and car this model stood out  .
great overall unit  .
comes with everything you need to mount on your bike and in the car  .
accurate , easy to read , logical layout  .
my only gripes (and they are small) is that i wish the screen is a tad bigger and the movement of the display as you drive is a bit smoother  .
very small gripes overall and outstanding unit  .
used this on a long distance bike trip and it made the trip  .
we found great places to eat , and rode the areas like a local  .
if you have a motorcycle , this is your gps  .
fan fraggin tastic .
i is amazed at how easy this unit is to set up and get on the road with  .
within minutes i had the zumo out of the box and mounted on my hd ultra classic  .
the included ram mounting system did the trick  .
running the wiring to the battery took a little time , but is well worth it and the unit looks great the screen is very bright and i have not found any conditions that would prevent me from seeing the screen , even in the strongest direct sunlight  .
the touch screen and control buttons are very easy to use , even while riding , but use caution here , it's easy to get distracted while trying to work your way through the screens if your riding the options to stay off of freeways and away from toll roads works great , but expect to spend a little extra time in the saddle , it's nothing to be concerned about a word of caution , the motorcycle mount has a security screw that allows the unit to be secured in the mount  .
when i arrived at my first destination i tried to remove the gps but the screw had vibrated into the locking position , preventing the unit from being removed from the mount  .
fortunately i had the special security screwdriver (included in the box) with me and is able to remove the unit for storage  .
not a major problem for short trips , but i would not have wanted to leave it out for long periods of time after all there are those who choose to deprive us of our property out there all 'n all it's a great unit , its better than units that come as standard equipment in most cars , and it's waterproof .
this is an excellent unit with many features and functions  .
clear sound from car mount speaker  .
sometimes bluetooth would not disconnect from phone when powering down  .
hard to plan a round on the unit , best to work with pc software  .
connection to pc easy and quick with supplied cable .
great unit , i also got the nuvi 350 for travel  .
this is a great unit  .
very easy to use and to view while riding  .
with the included car and motorcycle mounts its easily to move from car to motorcycle  .
mounting is easy and sturdy  .
one thing i didnt like is that installation instructions dont cover wiring at all  .
i would also like to see the pio icons on the screen like i get with my acura gps  .
i think cost is reasonable , got mine on line about $670 this is a sturdy unit  .
mine took a tumble while riding because i hadnt secured it properly and the unit is fine touch screen is good and i like that i can use a gloved finger screen is also nicely lit and easy to see outside i would like to see more routing methods like i get in the acura unit  .
max and mix highway , scenic route like on the laptop gps would be nice  .
there are avoid options that include highway and tolls which is helpful i like that when you are tracking your route the screen names the street that is coming up id like to also have a full screen mode that shows only the map with the motorcycle centered for easier view of where youve been i really like that the unit tracks where youve been and keeps it even after the unit is turned off this is very helpful especially since ill be taking this unit on the trails with a dirt bike .
great unit and easy to install on a bike  .
the greatest thing is there are many 3rd party map providers that are compatible with garmin mapsource  .
i have used for couple days and it has been a great experience  .
very user friendly even for my wife  .
do not listen to people that say it does not play stereo through sound system  .
it does if you get a 3  .
5mm stereo cord  .
they make them in mono and will play mono with a mono cord  .
the price is high , but if you figure the cost of a good bluetooth hf unit for car , mp3 player for the motorcycle and the easy nav system , it is a bargain in one package  .
i have installed this on my 2006 harley street glide and the kit is pretty good and is very sturdy  .
i do not like the security screw  .
it is a pain and you can steal the unit by disconnecting the cradle quick release  .
overall this is a great product .
the update answers a lot of things that make the zumo even more perfect  .
a compass page is now the second screen , and it has data fields with elevation and shows bearing when on a route for the update go here    .

if you ride a motorcycle , you can cannot go wrong picking this unit  .
the mounting hardware is top quality and solid  .
the unit can be easily removed from the bike with a flip of the lever and fits in your pocket so that it wo not walk away if you leave your bike unattended  .
it takes all of 3 seconds to install it again the screens are distilled to the essential functions that are needed for a bike rider  .
the voice prompts are a bit off in timing and location however one easily compensates for it  .
it is very water resistant , i got slammed with quite a wave from a passing car and the unit never blipped from the gallons of water that hit us  .
switching from vehicle and map view is trivial and easily accomplished with heavily gloved hands my only complaint is with trip planning , entering waypoints and points of interest is somewhat clunky and not intuitive  .
i solved the poor documentation problem by going to one of the more popular gps forums  .
there are a couple of workarounds documented regarding this problem if you want a gps for a motorcycle , this unit does an outstanding job  .
it also works well in an automotive environment though it does not compare to an oem nav package .
first of all i am not a techie , and not an expert with many gps devices  .
i received this gift from my fiancee for the holiday and it is a snap the bright touchscreen works with a glove hand  .
also the screen is bright enough for daytime riding  .
most touchscreens lose its visibility in the sunlight , but not the zumo  .
this gps device is awesome for a biker  .
most of the controls are located on the left (clutch hand)  .
also this device has bluetooth capabilities that you can connect to your bluetooth phone and make phone calls from the device  .
it will actually download your phonebook from your phone automatically i know many riders complain about not being able to plan their routes on the internet  .
no worries with the zumo as well  .
you can plan trips with alternative routes etc another great thing that bikers would love with this device is that the satellite antenna is actually internal  .
so no worries about extensive wiring for the satellite , but only one wire to connect the motorcycle mount to the battery the mp3 player is great too  .
you need to purchase a sd card for more music  .
and you have to use apple itunes for music downloads  .
it even stores pictures (a function that i really don't care about) the zumo is not just for your motorcycles but it does include an automobile mount that comes with a speaker/microphone so you can hear warnings , directions , phone calls and music  .
it also can be connected to your 12v plug , so that the battery can recharge all and all this is a wonderful product  .
another negative i would say is that the mount does not fit my 2004 bmw k1200gt (handlebar or clutch mount)  .
i had to get a special mount to hold it no more riding just to get lost anymore  .
with the quick satellite connection , you'll always know were you are .
looks great , simple to use  .
love the screen day or night  .
this zumo 550 is smarter than i am  .
i've only had it a week for my pizza deliveries and it is awesome  .
the battery works great  .
when i'm in the store waiting for the next delivery i keep it running on the battery , this way the unit doesn't shut off and i don't waste a minute or less for it to find the satelites  .
the battery never wears down because it is charging while i'm using it  .
also i am going to mount it on my harley motorcycle  .
(comes with motorcycle mount and the unit is waterproof) i have researched over thirty gps's and i chose the zumo 550 (my first gps) and glad i did  .
very expensive but way ahead of the field  .
there is many more options to this unit but i haven't tried them yet  .
i cannot wait to use this for my trip to sturgis on my harley  .
if you do not mind paying the high price then i highly recomend the zumo 550 .
used on my motorcycles for a couple of years  .
usually , not to find a place , but to find way home after a ride  .
next time some idiot says i always use a map , do not need no gps ask them to pinpoint 1234 main st in anytown usa and see how their map fares .
just to let all zumo 550 users there has been a software update as of  .
october 18 , 2008 for the zumo 550  .

for those who has a xm radio and also has a bluetooth and handset  .
this unit is well rounded and you would love it .
ok , this is concentrating on the bluetooth functionality because garmin choose the parrot ck5000 chip instead of the parrot ck5050 series chip , you won't be able to listen to your mp3s in stereo with the quality it deserves  .
you may find , like i and many others , that your music will sound hissy and distorted  .
it's so bad it gives me a headache  .
being a motorcycle rider , the idea of hands    free operation with bluetooth along with listening to my music with bluetooth is appealing  .
however , the sound quality for mp3s does not cut it you can get stereo sound from the base output jack , but then you lose hands    free firmware updates wo not fix the issue it's notable to point out on the positive that linking a phone and a headset to the unit works great also , the unit has tried to take me down one    way roads when it calculates routes .
my only real major complaint with the zumo is the volume and lack of headphone jack on the stand    alone unit  .
with the volume of the zumo set to maximum 100% , my motorola motopure h12 blue    tooth earpiece set to maximum 100% , it is still difficult most times to hear the instructions over the traffic , engine and wind noise of my motorcycle , even with a full face helmet and traffic road noise my car  .
i do not have loud exhaust on either vehicle  .
the zumo mount with the built    in speaker for the car is next to useless with the volume sound to low  .
at 100% i want ear piercing volume  .
the motorcycle mount has a phone jack but negates the wireless feature  .
the volume with the phone jack is somewhat better but only marginally even with the zumo at 100%  .
if i retain the zumo 550 i am in a desperate search for a blue    tooth headset that will be able to pump up the volume at least 5 time greater ear piercing volume i am looking for i would like to indicate that i am not that hard of hearing  .
i have had other people with better hearing , than myself , verify the low volume problems .
good unit  .
impossible to get lost with it on the only problem i have is when i speed up and my motorcycle vibrates more (i have a russian ural)i loose my extenal power  .
sometimes it comes back on by itself , other time the unit shuts down if i do not hit continue on unit battery power  .
all conections check out ok .
until this and some other glitches i've read are fixed , this is a gps to stay away from .
general functions are ok  .
simple and intuitive  .
i have had to recalibrate the touch screen three times in two months , but all appears ok now beware of using two gxm 30 antennae (one for motorcycle and one for your car) as you will require two xm subscriptions  .
this takes away from the unit's ability to serve both motorcycle and auto needs .
i purchased the garmin zumo 250 in dec 2010  .
i used it in the car once , and it worked great  .
i had the hardware installed on my 08 ultra classic ultra glide  .
everything is hooked up perfect  .
turned the unit on , and all of my maps were wiped out  .
don't know what the problem was , but i could not program anything  .
the customer service for garmin is great , once you got ahold of someone  .
i waited over 30 minutes to talk to customer service , and the is put on hold to talk to a software expert  .
i is on the phone a total of 162 minutes  .
the software expert tried to download the maps back into my unit , but it kept freezing up at about 8% complete  .
i is on the phone 4 different times with customer service , and product support  .
alomst 6 hours total  .
garmin management needs to shorten the time wait for customer service  .
that part is terrible  .
the first customer service representative told me i could just send the unit , itself , with out all the hardware , and they would send me a new one , the last night i spoke to another service representative  .
she told me that if i did not send the complete package , with all hardware , cd's , etc  .
, i would not get a new garmin zumo 550 in return  .
i would get a refurbished one  .
i had to take my motorcycle to my electrical mechanic , and have him uninstall the hardware  .
i ended up taking the garmin zumo 550 back to costco  .
costco has an awesome return policy  .
i did order another garmin zumo 550 from costco  .
com  .
i think if the new one works properly , i will be ecstatic  .
it is an awesome unit , with the built in mp2 , sd card , xm capabilities  .
i cannot really give it a great review , but i think the next time i review , it should be a good one  .
the software expert at garmin , has no idea why everything is wiped out of the unit  .
no explanation could be given  .
she came in from the backside of computer and tried to download the software again , but all failed  .
i will give another review , once i get my new garmin zumo 550  .
cannot wait  .
garmin wait time is over 30 minutes garmin zumo 550 not worth the price  .
the first 3 times i used gps i got lost because gps stopped working  .
detour just wanted me to go in a circle gps unit is still under warranty  .
i had to pay shipping to purchase gps and i had to pay shipping to return unit for repair  .
will garmin credit me the warranty time (extend time) for time they have the gps (i do not think so) garmin website has over 300 users (who wrote a compliant) with same problem .
about a year ago i bought a garmin gpsmap76csx hoping it would cover all of my gps applications  .
in the car , on the boat , out on the trail    the unit worked well  .
but on the bike    not so much  .
so when i heard about the zumo 550 , i started googleing  .
i read about the biker friendly features at garmin  .
com and it is all good but the price seemed high for a gps  .
then i realized that this umit could solve some of my audio issues by co    ordinating several sound sources and eliminate the wire dangling from my helmet  .
ok if i factor in a bluetooth mp3 player and the hands free cell phone feature , maybe the price sounds better  .
so i went to the reviews  .
writters and riders alike seem to be giving the zumo a thumbs up  .
i is reaching for my plastic but something was not right  .
as i re read the marketing bumph and then the not so technical zumo specs at garmin  .
com , i couldn't tell if the bluetooth feature is mono or stereo  .
so i phoned garmin tech support for the bad news  .
the bluetooth feature is mono  .
yes this means that after you pay big bucks for bluetooth headphones or maybe a new bluetooth helmet , your zumo    mp3 player tunes will be heard in mono  .
maybe that's why garmin does not include bluetooth head phones in the zumo package  .
i bought the zumo after reading a couple of favorable reviews primarily for use on my motorcycle  .
i have to give the unit high marks for its interface and the display it really does have some neat features  .
unfortunately , the buggy software makes the unit undependable  .
it has experienced multiple lock    ups in the power off mode while in the mount over the first month i've owned it  .
the unit simply will not power back on  .
the only way to recover is to use a 2mm hex wrench (not supplied) to remove the battery and then reinstall  .
surprisingly , this is not an uncommon occurance  .
a quick internet search led me to a zumo users forum where i found many cases of folks having the very same problem  .
if you do not mind reinstalling the battery from time to time this might not bother you but for me the zumo seems likely to become an expensive paperweight .
i purchased a zumo 550 to go along with the many motorcycles i own  .
i thought it would be a nice tool to help navigate on my trips  .
it is a gps and should be able to provide basic navigational information , right  .
wrong  .
while garmin added a lot of nice bells and whistles with bluetooth and mp3 capability , it failed to include such basic functions as altitude and a compass that functions while the unit is navigating to a waypoint  .
it also fails to provide a heading indicator or any reference of direction on the route page  .
you can toggle to the trip information page and get a basic heading readout (n , s , w , e) but not a true compass heading  .
give me a break garmin needs to provide the following fixes to this product 1  .
provide altimeter readout  .
(this is a gps is not it  .
) it would be nice to know if you were operating at 500 feet or 15 , 000 feet 2  .
provide a compass that is accessible not only while off road but while navigating a route 3  .
provide a bearing indicator on the route page so that you can determine direction of travel while viewing this page  .
again , it would be nice to look at the route page and be able to determine direction of travel  .
i know the garmin 360 has a bearing pointer on the route page garmin dropped the ball on this one  .
the information i have outlined above is critical to a motorcyclist  .
i paid close to $1 , 000  .
00 for this product and it has in some instances less capability than a basic model  .
it also requires a $250+ antenna to receive xm radio  .
what gives  .
garmins marketing campaign sums it up best , designed by bikers motorcycle    friendly high end navigation features  .
i think not  .
someone should have included a motorcyclist on their design team .
it's not a lack of features , because it delivers quite well  .
but again i know i'm repeating my self but i cannot justify the price  .
i've been using a quest for years , and it's a great unit  .
my wife bought me the zumo i would have rather had a flat screen tv for that price  .
oh i have that already .
Excellent interface, good display.; Slow route calculations, guidance can lag actual position, unit locks-up in power-off state.
Internal Antenna, Bluetooth, MP3, waterproof, bright touchscreen; Price, Expensive accessories (XM antenna SD Card), or No universal mount
Easy to use and easy to setup.; Planning trips and inserting waypoints not very clear.
Excellet unit, many functions, clear screen, two mounts w/wiring, good map coverage; Meager manual, typing on touch screen cumbersome, cannot Bluetooth to PC
Everything about it.; Not as easy to use as the computer on the Enterprise C.
Fits great and many 3rd parties have developed maps in support of Garmin; It would nice if it were thinner
user friendly without the manual. mp3 is awesome, bluetooth works great!; needs audio adapter on unit, not cradle. needs car cord to hookup to unit, not cradle.
Works great on both my bike and truck. It came with EVERYTHING you need.; Routes could be better. Sometimes I just don't know what it is thinking.
Excellent features, Bluetooth headset integration, use in car; Not for me but I guess the price could be less
Screen presentation, easy handling...; To pricey for what it delivers. There are so many other units that have the same capability, but are not water resistant. That addiional cost not worth it.
Easy to use. A dummy like me had no problem getting started.; I would have like to see this unit take several addresses and route them at one time.
Portable, Great features, comes with mounting hardware for BOTH motorcycle and auto, GPS, MP3, and bluetooth Cell phone intergration. What else is there!; I really couldn't find any downside to this unit. It's as good as it gets.
User friendly.with lots of functions needed for road trips. Easy to read screen, Text to Speech, compact; Volume to low at maximum setting. Quality of MP3. No headphone jack or speaker in stand-alone unit.
As a biker's GPS, I'd put the zumo at the top of my "buy list" based on the reviews I've seen.; As a combined GPS and wireless communication / entertainment device the zumo drops to my "by by list" - at least for now.
Easy to use, works well, easy upgrade, easy to add POI's; Locks up once in a while and you have to get the tool to take the battery out to reset it
History of where youve been, gloved friendly touch screen, easy mounting, bright screen, car and motorcycle mounts, quick reaction, sturdy bracket, sturdy unit; Only minor things which most can be fixed with update No installation instructions for motorcycle wiring, no POI icons on screen, missing max highway, min highway and scenic route methods, security
It shows where you are and maps a route to where you want to go. Fine, all GPS units do this, even those for under a hundred dollars.; If you fat finger the screen when entering your Security Code, which is easy to do wearing gloves, you get a screen that tells you you must go to your Security Location in order to unlock the GPS, rendering it USELESS if you're far from home!!. DUMB!
This unit has everything plus more than you need. I have my bluetooth phone and headset attached to it. I have my xm radio coming through my unit.; No speaker on the unit itself. You have to attach it to the mount to get sound. the xm antenna is pricey.
Touch screen, bright images, Hope to have better luck with next Garmin Zumo 550; Lost all maps on unit, so I wasn't able to use it, but one time. Was great for the short time I used it. Returned to Costco, and ordered another one. Hope to have better results from the new Garmin Zumo 250
Works very well, just like advertised. I have had this unit for a little over a year and use it regularly as I am a 365 day a year rider. Regular lifetime updates have kept me up to date and the unit always works well.; I have not found any yet.
Easy to understan and use right out of the box -- lot of usfull additions for the unit and mounting to car or Harley. You don't have to add much more.; Not much to dislike in this unit.
All pros. I use it on my motocycle. Bought it while station in Hawaii and I never got lost. No matter were I am transferd I use it and save gas. I would never go anywhere with out it.; Only one: It should come with the XM cable and the key lock so I can leave it on my motorcycle and don't have to take it off when my park my Motorcycle.
The Zumo 550 is biker friendly, and it's easy to use for the GPS illiterate. This unit has all of the bells and whistles that a biker or car driver could want.; A little pricey. I'm still playing with all of the buttons, but after two weeks of use I have not had any issues that would cause me to want to send the unit back.
