it 's hard to write the review for our stay at this hotel , as coming to this island is a bit like stepping back in time to a simpler time .
the locals on this small island have limited grocery stores , restaurants , and lodging options , but the scenery is breathtaking .
spend a day or two on the island at least , and you can catch the sites and do some or all of the hiking trails that circle the island .
the locals are incredibly friendly , and i could n't recommend the glen hotel more for a great place to stay while you 're here .
you have to ferry over to reach the island , from burtonport , and the glen hotel is just 2 minutes up the hill from the landing .
the hotel is beautiful , and the sheep in the front lot just completes the picture of this beautiful island .
the rooms are quite comfortable , and each room has it 's own bathroom ( along with several extras along the floor ) .
the traditional irish breakfast was delicious , and the attached bar/restaurant made a convenient and tasty option for dinner one night .
as our second day was a bit rainy and cool , there was really nothing better than staying close by the peat moss fire , drinking some guinness and having a nice dinner with friends .
i would definitely recommend that visitors to the island check out the glen hotel for accommodations .
the owners are incredibly welcoming , the rooms are nice , . . .
