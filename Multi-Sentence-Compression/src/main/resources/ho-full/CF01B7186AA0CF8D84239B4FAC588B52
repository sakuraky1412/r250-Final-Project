stayed here for 3 nights in august .
package , booked on the hotel 's website , included parking - always a bonus in large cities .
parking is provided in a garage opposite the hotel and staff always valet park your car .
recommend booking directly through the hotel 's website as there are often better packages and cheaper rates .
on this occasion we had a reasonably sized room on the third floor looking out onto other buildings but this was ok as we were hardly in the room .
room had a queen sized bed with bedside tables , a wardrobe with reasonably sized safe , a desk with chair , tv and bar fridge with free soft drinks and two good alcoves under the windows to store bags .
bathroom was a reasonable size with a stand alone shower .
the shower pressure was good .
room and bathroom were very clean and the free wifi was excellent .
breakfast was a very large , but mainly cold , buffet of cereals , quiche , meats , cheeses , vegetables , pastries , fruit , yoghurt , juices , tea and coffee .
there was generally 2 hot dishes being scrambled eggs and frankfurts/sausages .
some additional hot dishes or a change in variety would definitely enhance , what is already a very good , breakfast experience .
free tea , coffee and biscuits along with a couple of computers and newspapers are available in the comfortable lounge area on the ground floor .
they also have a very good aperitivi in the bar in the evenings .
we have always found the staff on the front desk , at breakfast and in the bar to be very friendly and helpful and this visit was no exception .
one of the features that attracts us to the berna is its closeness to the metro , with the entrance to the metro about 150 metres away at the end of the street .
the duomo is only 4 metro stations away .
it is also only about 400 metres away from milan central railway station .
the surrounding area also continues to improve in appearance .
would absolutely stay again as it is a very good value for money stay .
