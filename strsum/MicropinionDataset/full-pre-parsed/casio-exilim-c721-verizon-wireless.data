buy it , you'll be happy that you did  .

it's something that you do not (ever  .

) see hanging around you  .

it's impressive nad has lived up to all of my high expectations .

you can get this phone without having to buy one of verizon's bs data packages , which is its main attraction for me  .

i used this phone as a dedicated camera on a recent trip to mexico and it performed really well  .

inquisitive schoolchildren loved seeing themselves on its preview screen  .

it is also usable for calls back to the us , and the call quality is good  .

it's ruggedized , so i did not have to worry about downpours or humidity affecting it , unlike other digital cameras i've had in the tropics  .

i'm currently using it as a modem (tethering is $49  .

99/mo for 5gb from verizon) , and i'm able to watch hulu , run pandora , and browse other sites  .

it's fast  .

my only problem has been actually getting the photos off the camera , since the included software has issues maintaining a camera    pc connection during downloads  .

i suggest using the phone's bluetooth abilities to download photos and forgoing the included software altogether .

this phone slips easily and safely into my jeans pocket without bulk , screen is visible in room and outdoor light so i can see timers for workingouts for self and horses , alarm will replace my old stand    alone alarm clock with much better tones to announce wake    up , already got water on it when open when our just    bathed great pyrennes decided to shake his fur out all over me without any problem for screen or keys  .

have not needed html/net access yet  .

have taken and downloaded pics and video clips and have put my 10 mgp canon on standby as a result ditto 3ccd digital video camera  .

imaqes are crisp  .

image storage limited by microsd capacity  .

still cannot replace my pda with it , though for me , bottom line , worth getting , enjoy using .

i love my exilim  .

brilliant pics i can take for myself or show clients with a picture  .

walk into a group of folks trying to find something on the jobsite or campsite with their phones and light up the area with my exilim    hey  .

thats neat  .

i waited for the 4g models expecting casio to bring an awsome camera phone to the table  .

but , no  .

casio dropped pixils to 3 from 5 on the exilim  .

as a pricy phone , tech support locally is based on removing the battery to see if something happened  .

the exilim cleans up all the average conference call noise for the rest of the callers  .

many commented on the sudden clarity  .

i never forget the before and after pictures at the jobsite updated  .

on oct 14 , 2010  .

it is atrocious that a high    end flip phone such as this both is not compatible with windows 7 and any 64    bit version of windows  .

not even vista 64    bit  .

i have not chosen this phone yet , but i may get it for my girlfriend anyway , because she hates her touch screen phone and likes the great camera and flash in this one it remains to be seen if i can force the drivers to work with windows 7 , whether 32    bit or 64    bit (i have my ways) , but we should not have to worry about this in this day and age  .

windows 7 has been out for a year next month a suggestion to try for windows 7 compatibility is using windows xp mode (not compatibility mode , emulating xp via microsoft virtual pc)  .

i think it supports usb devices  .

i'm unsure , however , if the host os requires drivers in order for the drivers in the emulation to work , but it's a thought .

probably would not have bought it owing to mac incompatibility , which means i have to send photos over the internet to my mac , which requires compression and loss of quality  .

a pretty terrible oversight on casio's part , and i've found no available mac    compatible software  .

otherwise it's a good camera and a serviceable phone .

the camera features are truly camera quality  .

flipping the screen around to use as viewer is  genius  and having the buttons on top that feel like real camera buttons make it as easy/simple/intuitive to use as a regular old camera with the microsd slot you can take a lot of pictures/videos  .

note   to use the sync dock , you need to be running xp home or older (seriously  .

) , but its not necessary if you save all your photos/etc a flash card and then put that directly into your computer  .

if you use a microsd card this phone  is  compatible with mac   .

most ruggedized phones (i  .

something that's not gonna break every time it gets bumped) are ugly and huge/fat  .

this phone is larger than a lot of other flip phones , but no so big that its a big deal , mostly because its slim and sleek (fits in your pocket) i had a cheap samsung flip phone (samsung smooth) that had abysmal call quality , and i wanted to find something with acceptable battery life and clear calls so i wouldn't be constantly repeating myself  .

this gets good signal but also has good speaker quality (you hearing the caller) and good microphone quality (them hearing you) verizon doesn't make you have a data plan with this phone , which is a plus for me (i'm attached to my computer all day , don't need a smartphone)  .

it does do some limited data stuff like vcast etc i have not dropped it in water (yet  .

) but considering the rest of its 'ruggedized' features hold up , i would assume it really can take a dunking with out shorting out (we've all been there  .

if i lost it , i'd buy the same one again  .

my favorite camera of all i've owned .

i would recommend it  .

i am enjoying this phone  .

great camera in the daylight .

last week , i upgraded my 3    year old samsung a990 to the new casio exilim c721 , and have now used this phone extensively and formed some strong opinions the good news    .

g1) c721 has a good camera , including optical zoom  .

i like the photos and controls , and feel this upgrade from 3  .

2 mp to 5  .

1 mp is important  .

g2) vz navigator works almost everywhere on the c721 , including inside many buildings where i know many competitors won't operate well g3) i like the flexibility of assigning shortcuts on the c721 in comparison to the more limited a990 g4) great screen , easy to use keyboard , nicely lit keyboard g5) nice size , fits well in my hand g6) very good battery life g7) the flip and rotate screen is great  .

using the phone as a camera easy and natural g8) decent sound quality for rings and speaker phone  .

good phone reception and operation g9) one button shortcut to place into vibrate mode , turn on speaker , activate voice control , speed dial , lock the phone , and more g10) instant response , no hesitation to any function    except camera does take a couple of seconds to start g11) water dust resistance    should come in handy in future the bad news (b1    4)  .

most of the new features i is hoping to be upgraded (aside from the camera) still have most of the same a990 disappoointing limitations ; some are quite irksome  .

i don't know if it is casio or verizon who are responsible for this poor software b1) verizon calendar functionality is mediocre the c721 cannot   tie appointments to contacts and/or notes  .

it does not permit setting default values for appointment fields  .

it forces me to specify cdt vs cst  .

why not give me the option of just specifying ct without the d or s  .

let the cell network figure out whether daylight savings time is active b2) c721 contact groups are limited to a max of 10 entries  .

how in the world do programmers think you can sell a phone with 500 or 1000 phone contacts and only permit a max of 10 contacts per group  .

b3) when i looked up contacts on the a990 , i would just open the phone and type the starting letters of a name  .

for example , to look up elaine , just type   352 (more digits if you like) and press up arrow  .

contacts matching 352 would pop    up  .

fast and simple  .

with the c721 , i have to use contact search method (also available on a990)   press contacts , and multi    tap through names   c335552    typically twice the keystrokes i don't appreciate search for contacts only by matching characters at the beginning of name  .

i need to search by any portion of name , by phone number or area code  .

i store names as bob jones  .

i want to search for jones and also find bob jones the a990 had a note field associated with each contact ; the c721 has dropped this important feature overall , this phone has barely adequate , mediocre contact list group software functionality b4) casio photo editing software is inadequate  .

my a990 provided ability to rotate , crop and size , annotate , copy paste , apply various effects to photos  .

the c721 cannot rotate photos , cannot perform the majority of a990 photo editing functions , and the minimal crop resize are only of limited use  .

i'm really disappointed by the mismatch of software to this better type of camera    a significant step down from what i had with the a990 summary  .

well , i got the improved optics , resolution , and optical zoom i wanted in this upgrade from my old samsung a990 to the new casio exilim c720  .

pretty much everything else is on par with what i had or a downgrade  .

with better software , i would rate the camera 4  .

5 out of 5  .

0 , but have to rate it 3  .

5 instead  .

with better contact and calendar software , ease of use should have been a full point higher than the 3  .

0 rating i giving the c721  .

i'm also giving myself a 2 for making the decision to do this upgrade  .

i should have continued to wait for a more significant camera    phone product  .

and for those of you who would suggest the samsung omnia 5 mp phone    i've used one for about a week , and didn't like it either  .

i'm convinced that verizon just does not offer a high    quality full    featured camera    phone product yet in the usa .

my phone must be water tight and be able to bounce a little  .

of the progression of casio's tough phones , this has been the best by far  .

although the front display is too small and dim to be of use , the phone's main display is great and is almost usable in bright sunlight the phone is easy to operate  .

the camera and video take some getting used to but after owning the phone for a couple of years , is is now simple to operate my problem with the phone is the lousy microphone  .

any wind noise and the other party cannot hear me  .

also , the speaker is not on par with other phones that play music , etc  .

i suspect that both of these problems are largely a result of making the phone water tight          which is the main reason i bought this phone .

over all it is a good phone for everyday use  .

you do not have to worry about dropping it and it breaking  .

even better if you drop it in water  .

i think most of you know what i mean  .

i like how slim it is and not as clunky as the g'z one  .

feels good in the hand not heavy , but there  .

it can be dressed up with skins  .

i would like to be able to have front display clock stay on  .

and be able to store contacts on card  .

the rest of my dislikes are mainly with verizons software  .

and the price .

unsatisfactory  .

the usb driver for this phone is not compatible with windows 7  .

there is no update available from casio  .

you will not be able to connect to laptop or pc  .

no accessmanager , no mobilebroadband  .

those and many other advertised features require a usb connection which is not possible to any windows 7 computer  .

this is totally unsatisfactory .

what i wanted is a phone  .

the first one i got , the contact list vanished like 3 times , explainably  .

also people cannot hear me talk  .

sent it back , now no problem with the contact list , but people still say i sound muffled and too much background noise  .

contacted verizon , asked to change to another phone , they wanted $20 for upgrade to a cheaper phone (which my husband has to problem with) + $35 restocking fee  .

not helpful @ all  .

when asked what recourse a customer has with faulty design her answer is that there are 5 star reviews on the phone and to keep returning the product until you get one that works for you .

i bought it because i do photo augmenting and liked the notion and convenience of having a high resolution camera without having to carry more than just a cell phone with me  .

but the pictures i took were just too washed out  .

when setting the resolution at its highest , picture quality only got worse  .

the only semi    decent quality pictures were those taken in full sunlight there is an unacceptable time delay when opening the picture folder  .

the camera is set up to show three thumb nails when initially accessed  .

you have to wait for the thumb nails to open before the camera would permit you to exit the function (should you have pressed it by accident) there is very little you can do with a photo  .

you are pretty much obligated to just accept the shot as you have taken it  .

any 'corrections' you might want to apply to a photo have to be performed prior to the actual snap shot  .

unless you're a professional photographer , you don't know what lighting corrections will need to be done the covers for the battery and sd card compartments were rather suspect and appeared to be vulnerable to future breakage  .

while i know that they have to be tightly sealed for moisture prevention , they were constructed of plastic and flexed too much  .

and , after all , plastic doesn't have too high a resiliency and will slowly crack after too much flexing  .

further , the sd card cover is the only reason that the sd card stayed in place  .

it just would not 'lock' when pushed into the slot perhaps i is spoiled  .

i had the motorola razr v9m prior to this camera  .

the v9m did let you do a modicum of photo correction and augmenting  .

it also let you do video editing for length  .

that is why i bought the casio exilim c721  .

i thought it would be in the same realm as the v9m since it is a high res camera phone  .

sadly , it is not  .

i ended up taking it back and getting the envy touch  .

and to my surprise , it does with photos what i is looking for as well as with videos  .

and the picture quality here  .

well , that's my next review .

for a phone that is supposedly mil    spec to die a seemingly random death only 40 days after purchase is suspect  .

i now seriously wonder if the next phone is going to do the same thing  .

casio truly makes some tough products , but the camera phone now has me wondering  .

before today's incident , i would gladly have rated it 4  .

5 stars  .

in 6 weeks i will update this entry  .

i hope this is just a one in a million fluke , but i just read a reviewer who is now working on his 3rd copy of this phone .

to much money for what you get ; maybe after its been out for awhile this phone would be a much better buy after all the bugs have been worked out .

the phones exterior is fairly nice but its the things inside of it that are horrendous it comes pre    loaded with 6 horrible and irritating ringtones  .

pictures cannot be rotated  .

i try to use pictures i took as wallpaper and it always says exceeded file size it claims it can use recorded sounds as ringtones but it cannot  .

instead it is pure silence it took 1 minute and 28 seconds to send a picture with    full reception     .

imagine how it is when sending a video  .

my other 20 dollar phone took less than 10 seconds the primary screen is very small for a phone thats 7 1/2 inches in total length  .

sending animated messages or messages with emo    cons only works verizon    to    verizon internet experience is very limited and one page on a computer comes out as like 4 pages on the phone  .

it only reads english characters so if you read things in different languages , it comes out as boxes  .

however , the internet loads faster than my dsl at home  .

youtube does not work  .

the phone cannot download any files whatsoever so you cannot send ringtones via message or link  .

phone has a nice design and is very glossy however  .

this is what makes it easier to scratch  .

1 month after i bought it , it's covered in scratches , i cannot even see anymore gloss and i do not even do anything with that phone but stick it in my pocket the screen in the front is too small surprised it even fit the time  .

it cannot display a 24 hour clock on this screen , which is the format i have been using since i can remember frankly the only thing this phone is good for is looks , texting , and calling and    nothing else     .

want a nice camera  .

buy it seperately  .

if you are like me (customizing everything , taking advantage of internet capabilities , and want a    way    above average phone) this phone is not for you  .

buy it if you want to be disappointed or you want something to make you mad i paid 280 dollars for this  .

you're better off buying the latest greatest cell phone from japan on ebay and unlocking it via hypersim  .

american service provider's phones are sadly terrible  .

40/100 (phones here in america) 120/100 (the rest of the world)  .

buy an unlocked phone somewhere and stick with a gsm network updated  .

on aug 4 , 2009  .

a camera with a phone as an add    on  .

not a professional grade phone .

do not buy this phone .
