i is a die hard canon fan  .

i researched alot of cameras  .

i have purchased canons before  .

i honestly could not see the value in the canon 20d  .

it felt plastic , cheap and could not understand the cost  .

the kit lense is a complete jock  .

the price difference between the nikon 70d and canon 20d is large  .

i know there are critics who will argue about the features of the canon vs nikon , don't waste your time  .

for me , i am a beginner and am still learning  .

i had some trepidation about switching camera brands , but again nothing about the canon impressed me  .

the features presented by others didn't seem like they would make a difference for my use  .

the nikon quality is incredible  .

the pictures are so great i cannot believe i took them  .

the color , clarity , and ease of use are worth considering  .

my canon g5 doesn't even come close to what this camera produces , period  .

for the price i doubt anyone would regret the purchase  .

you won't believe the pictures  .

the model i purchased included the 18    70 lense  .

extremely well built lense  .

the price of the canon lenses are ridiculous compared to the nikon  .

anyway , so far , i am so impressed with this camera that i am glad i switched  .

nikon has one happy consumer here  .

i wished i would not have waited so long before getting this unit  .

i wasted a lot of money on canon cameras  .

i could have got this one and been very happy  .

when i saw the low consumer rankings for this camera i is a bit dismayed until i read the opinions that say this is not much different than a d70  .

well , i don't own a d70 so those comments do not count for me  .

i switched from canon to nikon and i'm certainly glad i did  .

it's hard to improve on near perfection , but the d70s now has the intelligence of the nikon d2x  .

this is my first digital slr and i love it  .

i checked out the rebel , but prefer the hand feel and control of the nikon (besides beign loath to carry a camera with a name like rebel who are we kidding here) it's been on many trips with us , and has performed superbly  .

the color is good , ease of use and intuitive controls make it a joy to shoot with  .

i do find the auto focus locks on to objects not my subject , and some shots are soft  .

but for less than a grand , it's fantastic  .

overall a great camera  .

i have owned and used the d70s for about 14 months  .

nikon's upgrade from the almost legendary d70 is minimal    the slightly larger lcd and a remote socket the only noticible changes although the battery does seem to have a longer life , as claimed by nikon i suppose it's difficult to improve on the groundbreaking , almost perfect d70  .

i say almost perfect because i've never liked that cf card door  .

it's always given me the feeling that it's going to pop open at the worst possible moment (although it never has yet  .

)my initial worries about the overall build quality have generally subsided    i've hauled my d70s across continents and it's held up well despite a few scrapes egonomically , it's excellent and i would be splitting hairs to say that i would like a tadge more weight and bulk (a power pack may have done the trick here)anyway , for someone who lugs his slr evrywhere i'd only complain about the weight  .

image quality , speed , versatility and just about everything else have been well documented so i wo not go over them again  .

the d70 series may well go down in history as the forerunners to every dslr that has and will follow , are we using a future classic  .

the improvements between this and the d100 are night and day  .

this is your best buy for a digital slr       whether you're a pro or an amateur  .

do not be fooled into thinking you need a more expensive (  heavier) camera  .

the d1x will break your arm  .

with this , you get nearly all the same options and it feels like a feather in your hand .

don't be put off by any low rated opinions  .

if you take the time to learn how to use this instrument you will be delighted with the results  .

you do not need mega pixels , it is more important to know what to do with what you've got  .

the histogram display will help achieve a 'perfect' result  .

the 18    70 lens is very , very good , but you do , in addition , have access to the vast nikon lens system , a growing number of which are designed for digital use frame rate (especially with an 80x card) and battery life are both very impressive recommended  .

i upgraded from a coolpix 8800 (but kept the 8800)  .

this gives me many more options , and the results so far have been fantastic  .

i have found the options to be easy to access , (more than one way to get to the needed result) and the instant on has been wonderful .

bought this camera when it first came out in 2004  .

i have taken thousands of pictures in various light conditions and movement situations  .

been very pleased with the picture color quality and light control  .

the override manual options take a while to master but work great  .

no problems with my camera yet , a year and 4 months .

buy one if you can  .

i've owned my d70s for a month now  .

this is my third digital camera , but until now , for quality photography , i've been a film camera diehard  .

the d70s is a camera for the fairly serious hobbyist , and the price does reflect that  .

the number of buttons on the camera looks daunting at first , but the layout is logical , and it's easy to use , especially if you've used a nikon film camera before  .

the automatic and program modes make it easy to use    even my kids take have taken good pictures with it  .

the only downside i found is common to all slr's   it's big and bulky  .

be prepared to carry around a big camera bag full of accessories .

this is a great camera  .

my wife uses this as a point    and    shoot and i use the more advanced features  .

it's a great combination  .

it did take a little bit of tweaking on my part to make to point    and    shoot pictures come out to the level i wanted (using customized settings)  .

however , we can both use the camera and get great results  .

action is easy to capture with the high speed and great traking auto focus  .

definitely a great value for the money .

i cannot imagine anyone short of a working pro needing anything more than this camera i use it primarily for patient pictures and power point presentations  .

the macro lens i have (nikon) couples perfectly and the clarity and detail is amazing once one learns to use the digital features post    photo (i strongly suggest the nikon digital school courses) the raw (nef) photos allow incredible manipulation and correction of almost any photographer's errors if one can afford to purchase this camera and nikon lenses , the images produced will truly amaze even the most experienced professional photographers .

i've been into photography for 40yrs , mostly as a serious amateur  .

i've owned and used several high end medium format and 35mm format systems  .

i've been sitting on the fence reading and studying this digital revolution until this year and so now i'm using and getting to love this d70s  .

although not a pro level camera like my f5 , it shoots pretty fast and has almost no noticeable shutter lag  .

i say almost because i'm used to shooting with the f5  .

what i really like is how nikon placed the most used functions in a logical and very easy to set place on the camera  .

the things that you want to do quickly like change resolution , delete , iso , ev comp for flash and camera can be done without going into the menu  .

for my first dslr , i is able to use it pretty well without reading the book .

this camera seems to be able to remove all doubts i may have on wether i or the camera is at fault in taking some difficult shots  .

d70s works great with my mac and iphoto  .

as of this time i have not found any real faults , time will tell  .

so far this is the best camera i have ever owned and used .

just a dream to use .

i've had 2 minolta 35mm a 7000 and 8i  .

this camera is the reason i have finally and grudgingly given up my film cameras .

i love my d70 and thank nikon for updating the firmware to match the d70s  .

i am not sure all the news about it is warrented  .

the d50 is a new product  .

the d70s is just a minor hardware change and a big firmware change from the original d70 .

i have had this camera for 4 months , shot about 5 , 000 pics and it is an excellent tool , easy to use and adequate for about anything you want to do  .

i especially like the raw/jpeg feature allows for quick evaluation of shots and how they look great tool for the advanced photographer , will last indefinitely with little need to ever upgrade .

nikon optics are fantastic  .

you cannot go wrong with this camera  .

great for digital photo beginners or experts .

this is a very large heavy camera especially for my wife  .

the positives are worth the extra effort and both of us agree on this  .

the quality of the pictures and the ability to shoot multiple shots even with the nikon 800 flash in use is great  .

we use it mostly for church photography  .

use the flash extention arm so you can keep the flash in the proper alignment .

a great choice for most serious hobbyists  .

body is of superb build quality , better than what i found from nikon's usual competition  .

great battery charge life  .

even with my small hands , the heft and size is just about perfect  .

the d70s is fairly easy to use right out the box ; basic controls are straightforward for anyone with prior experience with most any digital camera , even point    and    shooters  .

menu system is easy to navigate and use , and the quick access buttons to more critical functions , settings and shooting controls on the camera back are welcome and easy    to    use , both for shooting and for reviewing stored images  .

the rear lcd is bright and easy to see under most lighting conditions ; the information lcd on the top of the camera is also just as easy to use  .

the viewfinder is bright and is pleasant to use ; arrangement of data is a snap to pick out and the generally the supplied focusing screen is clear enough for general use  .

image quality is generally very good to excellent for most lighting conditions and film speed settings  .

the d70s has been easy to wirelessly synch with remote speedlite sb800 flashes , and so far has been a breeze to use with other nikkor af lenses realistically , imo its image performance is not really close to the level of a contemporary , professionally    oriented dslr , even when shooting in raw format  .

moreover , it won't make me forget the feel and function of my f3hp 35mm film camera or even my ancient pentax mx and lx , used during another (photographic) lifetime  .

high iso speeds and low lighting make for poorer    than    expected quality images  .

autofocus in low light can be trying   the camera can and will balk at operating (taking the picture) at times ; even my point    and    shoot casio will always af shoot in the lowest of light levels  .

the optional d70 camera softcase is a cruel joke (on reliance for protecting your camera , that is) ; it's better to try to find and use the softcase for the discontinued d100 instead , though even that case requires itself to be completely removed from the d70s before the camera can be used on a monopod or tripod  .

the built    in flash imo performs acceptably , but should not be relied upon for more critical shooting ; a separate speedlite is highly recommended  .

i love my sb800 , but the lesser sb600 is probably more than enough of a match for the d70s  .

it uses the proprietary nikon raw format that may or may not be compatible with your favorite photo editor ; nikon's own raw handling/editing software is an extra    cost ($99) option  .

fortunately there's the freebie app rawshooter essentials 2005 available from pixelmantec to translate nikon raw data to tiff for use with photoshop or paint shop pro  .

the base 18    70mm zoom lens is good enough , but imo still doesn't provide the image quality level of a fixed focal length nikkor lens (i admit i hold a long    standing bias against zooms)  .

truly dislike the lack of a usable mirror lock    up even though the d70s' vibration level is pretty good ; still situations when shooting with a long lens may mandate as much vibration control as possible , and the d70s cannot answer the call in the regard  .

when manual focusing , the supplied focusing screen is imo only acceptable ; fine    tuned focusing is not its forte  .

additional af lenses are typical nikon ; i  .

, expensive , though the build quality is generally of a high level for most  .

non    af lenses work , but typically wreak havoc on metering functionality ; a separate hand    held meter is a must    have  .

for myself , i suspect that in my case i won't be happy long    term with the d70s ; at some point       and with enough pennies       i'll likely move up to the d200  .

but that's not to say this camera wo not do good by others , only that i've gotten used to a certain level of performance from my photographic equipment .

the d70 is my first nikon dslr (i have two nikon film slr's       an fg dating back to the early 1980s , and an f3) and i am quite pleased with the camera  .

with several nikon lenses already in    house , i decided that ninkon digital is the only way for me to go  .

i compared the features of the d70s and the d70 and decided that the cameras were virtually the same with the free firmware upgrade to the d70  .

i also saved some money (over $100) by buying the d70 over the 70s  .

if you like the extra  .

2 screen that that the d70s gives you , then that is the way to go , otherwise with the free firmware upgrade the cameras are identical (the d70 is just cheaper right now)  .

still prefer my film , but the prints from the 70 are pretty good .

no wonder the pros shoot canon  .

the d70 is a great camera , but this upgrade is no upgrade at all and just plain bad value for the dollar  .

if you have to have a nikon , just wait until the d70s hits the retailers' shelves and save yourself three or four hundred dollars as the price of the original d70 falls through the floor  .

you will be getting the exact same quality product and have enough left over for a great second lens .

i agree 110% with others who have noted that this is pretty much a worthless upgrade  .

there's a huge gap in nikon's dslr line , with nothing in between 6 and 12 mp come on  .

they really need to get an 8mp dslr out there .

do not bother if its more money than regular d70 , unless that extra  .

2 or  .

3 inches on the screen is really all that important come on nikon  .

come out with a real canon 20d competitor and we'll listen  .

why does this camera have to be such a put down  .

i have recently purchased a nikon d40 , and that seemed to satisfy my needs for a good camera  .

but when i tried the d70s at a friends i found it to manual , the quality is hazy , even on raw , it is heavy and the lcd screen is to small , even though nikon had room to add at least another inch  .

yess there are alot of good things about this but i is unimpressed  .

i like the camera , but i'm very disappointed with nikon d70 quality construction  .

my d70 fails to operate as many other due the problem known as blinking green led of death (bglod)   camara stops suddenly working .

plaqued with problems  .

even with light use , this camera's electronics suffered castastrophic failure twice  .

the first time it is repaired under warrenty , but , even though the camera had already failed inside the warrenty period , nikon would not repair it the second time as the warrenty had expired by then  .

the nikon customer service people are certainly pleasant , but pleasant about telling customers they must pay time and time again to keep a nikon camera operating  .

they spoke of my problems as if they were expected maintenance costs for a camera over three years time  .

booo hiss nikon buy a cannon  .

i have become a serious hobby photographer over the last 5 years  .

i have kept upgrading my cameras as my skills increased  .

i is really excited to upgrade to a slr camera and choose the d70 based on reviews  .

i had the camera for two weeks before i went on vacation  .

over 80% of the vacation pictures were out of focus  .

i used the auto focus setting  .

i had my three teenage nieces with me and let them use my other cameras  .

they all came up with better , sharper pictures than what i got with the d70  .

when i got back the store gave me a new d70 camera  .

it is better for the first 3 months then the auto focus started having problems again  .

there is a firmware upgrade to improve the auto focus  .

now 3 out of 5 scenery pictures are bad when using the auto focus feature  .

i simply cannot rely on this camera for scenery pictures  .

i take my minolta 7hi with me whenever i want to make sure i get really good scenery pictures the focus zone changed every time the setting is changed  .

there is a focus zone lock    but it only works with the camera in the manual setting for macro and family pictures the camera is great  .

for any quality focus pictures over 25 feet &  .

do not rely on this camera if you are really picky about sharp crystal clear pictures , do not get this camera  .

does nikon realy think we are that dumb  .

this is the same camera as the d70 , why even add the s  .

nikon releasing the same camera with a 0  .

2 inch larger screen , better battery life and some firmware improvments that will be updateable with any d70 actually    the same camera , larger screen , better battery life stop saying that the d70s and\or d50 are better the the rebel xt  .

the rebel xt is a diffrent generation    .

8 mp over 6 (even if you dont print at large sizes , what about croping  .

) rebels xt lighter , smaller body (and if you dont like it small , a battery grip costs 150 $) vs d70\s larger size and heavier weight rebel xt uses a digic ii cmos sensor which is used in the 20d and preforms excellent in high iso's even at 1600  .

the d70s uses a ccd 6 mp sensor which according to the stats is not preforming well at all at high iso's as far as im concerned , this is a stupid trick by nikon to get the shoppers of america and the rest of the world to exchange their d70 with a d70s and get pretty much the same camera .
