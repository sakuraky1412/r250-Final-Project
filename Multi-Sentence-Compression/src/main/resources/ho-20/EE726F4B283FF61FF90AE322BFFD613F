the complaints are two - only two lifts means you can wait some time for moving around the building ( we were on 13th floor ) and two days out of four there was really loud drilling from below between about 4pm and 6pm - made time spent in room impossible , one day i had gone back with headache and needed rest before going out to theatre and second night had carnegie hall tickets .

breakfast ( as some reviewers have said ) can be a bit of a scrum as the room is small but choose your time and it is really well provisioned and good helpful staff on hand .
