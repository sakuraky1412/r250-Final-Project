stayed for a whole week and could have moved in permanetly !
 all staff were so friendly and knew our names and helped us with so many details .
 they arranged for us to deliver hand knitted toys from australia to the children 's hospital and to visit and deliver school supplies to cambodia development organization orphanage in siem reap .
 these were both very rewarding experiences and certainly made our suitcases lighter !
 the numerous inclusions of our room on the privilege floor were excellent especially our driver , mr buntheurn who always got us to the temple before the crowds and told us lots of interesting facts .
 our own private driver , tour guide with excellent english and a great sense of humour !
 being met at the airport by judy was another inclusion that made our visit easier too .
 she talked with us each day about our plans and ensured they all came to fruition .
 every staff member in the dining room , the room cleaning staff and all other hotel staff were very friendly and always helpful .
 it is impossible to name all the amazing staff but 'superman ' in the dining room has the most engaging laugh and all the managers , mr tim , mr chenda and ms domra .
 we spent 3 days at the temples which were excellent , although our leg muscles worked hard but well worth the hours spent climbing them .
 also visited the cambodian silk farm workshops and boutique .
 it was interesting to . . .

 also visited the cambodian silk farm workshops and boutique .
 it was interesting to see the whole silk process and then buy some silk at very reasonable prices .
 spent a day at kulen mountain about a 2 hour drive through the rice paddies , villages and jungle to a local historical area in the mountains .
 the waterfall was huge and the lingams very interesting .
 this has been an exceptional resort to stay in and we would recommend it to everyone .
 certainly a dream holiday !
