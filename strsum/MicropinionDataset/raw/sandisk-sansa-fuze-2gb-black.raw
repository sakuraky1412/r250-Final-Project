Pros:. It does what it says. It plays music, it plays video. Quality is decent. Nice to have the microSD card addon for increased capacity.. 
Cons:. Hard to read stuff on the screen when you are outside and it's pretty bright outside. Wish they used a micro usb charger instead of a proprietary charger (so that you can use chargers that come with cellphones to charge). 

$$;
Pros:. What's not to like? video player music player radio voice recorder ( also record music from radio) Date time expandable memory .photoveiwer (supports slideshow with music) delete media directly without having to use pc or reformat device. Ect........ 
Cons:. is not recognized by the rhapsody software included. No big deal don't like rhapsody. Would've liked to see continous movie playing (one after the other like music) But no big deal.. 
Summary:. Works excellent . video quality is as goo as b4 sync if not a little better depending on original format. Sound quality is outstanding though suggest buying a different pair of earphone/headphones. Has preset stations some features include: fm options (regioon: usa or world and mode: stereo or mono) photo options: slideshow (with music) shuffle loop and to go list delete photo. video: brightness, bookmark, rate, delete. audiobooks: chmode on/off speed slow/normal/fast delete book, track info. Music options: add song to golist, rate, repeat, shuffle music EQ, replay gairn, delete song, track info.. System settings: wallpaper (color), display art in lists, backlight, power saver, sleep, language (various: french english spanish german, ect..) bightness volume normal or high, reset factory settings format, usb mode (autodetect/mtp/msc) info contains how many media files for each format video/music/podcast/audiobooks racordings. Also displays amount of memory used on self and sd card.. Battery level display and time display on main window(s) as well. Whats not to like? Recorder picks up even the faintest of sounds. Turn button whell is a nice added touch The on/off slide button could stand out a hair more otherwise better on side than face. Unit does take a little getting use to but easy enought the first go around. No need for user manual if you are familar with such products (mp3 players iPod ect) Basically it is a straight forward unit user friendly. Comes half charged which still last a long time. I used a 2GB microSD for expanded media playing refreshes in no time without having to shut off unit first. Find SD cards to be excellent to hold movies ( 3-4movies depends on format size) I originally had sansa c240 nice for just music/photos. For 2 yrs got its use dailly for hrs on end. Headphone wires got caught and after time the jack gave wave. So, had to replace. I liked the c240 unit Now love fuze same price yet more features + video. Kept my wall and car adapter which allows for play while plugged inYet usb/pc does not allow. Not a problem since pc used to transfer to device or from anyways. What more can I say. Will not work with iTunes or I tunes base media players. Will work with JetAudio, WinAmp and Windows media player. Is not compatable with iTunes. I am not sure on other media players other than had no luck with rhapsody though other people say different. Reson for rhapsody software is not to sync yet to buy music. look around you'll find cd's cheaper compared to long term payed music. Or just use limewire Aresgalaxy (preferred personally from sourceforge.net ) or any p2p file sharing program.. Updated. on Nov 14, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Similar to the ipod; easy to use, can add additional memory, screen big enough for movies, really good sound quality, NO ITUNES. 
Cons:. The system look is kind of boring, even with the color options, can freeze up sometimes, but WAY fewer than the ipod. 
Summary:. I used to have an ipod, but I got sick of using iTunes, and having my ipod freeze up on me CONSTANTLY. I was tight on budget so I instantly fell in love with the price, and of course the features. I bought it around Christmas time so it came with a pair of Skully headphones for $75. The way it works is also like the ipod, except it's a little backwards (like on the Playing menu, the order of the song name, artist, album on the display). This is like an improved ipod with an FM radio, recording capability, and an add memory option ! It's a total WIN (:. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound, not to bad graphics, feels pretty durable, easy to navigate, fits in hand very well, very easy to get music on from Windows Media Player.. 
Cons:. Holds fingerprints pretty badly but you can wipe them off, not to good earphones that come with it, that's about it on the cons.. 
Summary:. I love this MP3 player. It doesn't have too many features which I like, not to complicated, I figured out how to use it in like 30 seconds literately. I would recommend this to a friend.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nearly everything.. 
Cons:. The scroll wheel tends to not register at times, and it tends to bug when you try to sync through windows media player 11, but not much of a hassle there.. 
Summary:. What can I say, this is possibly the greatest mp3 player of all times. It has everything a standard iPod DOESN't have (except for games, but who needs games on a mp3 player when you've got video, music, and fm radio?). Simple and easy to use controls, video quality is great (the sound tends to not be in sync for videos 20min and longer, but only by a few milliseconds), and not to mention it has a nice sleek, professional-like design. You're not just limited to 2gigs either, obviously there's a huge selection of storage space AND color.. Another great feature is the fact that you can add a mini SD chip, which makes your storage that much larger.. Be warned however, like I mentioned, it tends to bug when trying to sync with wmp11 (trying to add over 14 or more songs at once through this program is a big no no). Sync through the folder or cd itself.. Overall, this is a great product, and a well spent ~$60-70 to any owner. Now please excuse me while I add more Band of Brothers episodes onto my Sansa Fuze. ^^. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, great storage (2gb), built in clip (no need for a case).. 
Cons:. Built in NON-REPLACABLE BATTERY. 
Summary:. Excellent 'micro' clip-on' mp3 player. 2GB storage keeps me with mixes and re-mixes (used to dj in the 'disco days) all day. Built if FM radio scans for stations (or you can manually tune using the control-circle on the front of the player. Excellent battery life (used it during the day, turned it back on and fell asleep. Battery was still powering the unit and continued for another 3 hours when I woke up the next morning). People that complained the screen is too small for videos must not have looked at it through the clear packaging before buying it. It isn't a video player!! People that complain that the menues are 'dull'-folks it has a small screen to give you titles and basics on the menues. READ THE INSTRUCTION BOOK and you will not have trouble with the small screen!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding sound;. Small size and light weight;. Can handle sdhc cards - more and removable memory;. Radio capability;. Wide range of supported file formats;. Battery life;. Price!!. 
Cons:. The central button is a little bit noisy;. The on/off-lock/unlock switch is difficult to use;. The earphones could be better (as almost any other player);. Some improvements in the menu interface would be welcome.. 
Summary:. When it comes to the real thing (play music) this one does a great job.. Almost half the price as a i**d for the same capacity (at least here in Portugal), and better sound quality.. With the proper headphones (I use a S********R px100), and well encoded files (or better FLAC files) you will have real pleasure moments.. If you want sound quality at a contained price don't look further.. I've read that the Fuze's small brother (SanDisk Sansa Clip+) is as good in an even small packaged, but I haven't tried it yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound. Good Interface. No need for I-tunes. Support for Audible Audiobooks. Support for Videos. Support for pictures. Support for Podcasts. Expandable Memory slot. 
Cons:. Synching with Podcasts. Requires converting of Videos in order to play on player. 
Summary:. I purchased this device for a couple of reasons, I didn't want another I-pod had one, it was over-priced, required the I-tunes (which I wasn't necessarily fond of) and was just not something I wanted to go back to.. The device is much smaller than almost any I-pod out there, save the shuffle. The interface is similar to the I-pod and like many others out there, has all the standard fair, Music, Videos, Pictures, Settings, it also includes a few that are not standard to all players; such as, Voice and FM Radio. In the Voice section you can record your voice notes and they appear here, or record something from the FM Radio that's built-in to the device.. First off, I don't listen to alot of music on any MP3 player, I listen primarily to podcasts, and audiobooks from Audible. This device handles both of these admirably. The one drawback to the podcasts that I have is that I haven't found anything that synchs podcasts as well as the I-Pod and I-Tunes but, the device handles podcasts just fine. Audiobooks with the Audible media manger no problem whatsoever, in fact one thing I like better about this device than my old I-pod is that when you hit the chapter ahead button in an audiobook, it actually goes to the next chapter, not the end of the book (like on the I-pod).. For my use it works great, I've been using Media Monkey, that software finds the device just fine and synchs with it (music) just fine.. All of this on top of the fact that it's ever expandable, just keep buying memory and use it and it's unlimited memory/storage space.. Love this device, and if I'm looking for a MP3 player in the future I'll definately consider another Sansa device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Rhapsody compatible, decent battery life, low price, good sound quality, voice recorder, microsd expansion slot, small, nice color screen. 
Cons:. Headphone slot on bottom of player (getting use to it), wish it had a hook to hang around my neck. 
Summary:. This player exceeded my expectations. It is a nearly perfect player in my opinion. The only thing I would improve is to increase the battery life to around 40+ hours. As far as rhapsody goes, the player loads almost instantly, even with capacity full on the player as well as the micro sd card. Also, transferring is very quick. I'd recommend this player to everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Micro SD expansion slot, Video playback, FM tuner and Voice recording. 
Cons:. Cramped scroll wheel, Easy to scratch screen, Small selection of accessories. 
Summary:. This player is more or less the best alternative to any iPod Nano. It includes video, FM, voice recording and much more features than the iPod Nano's. A downside is that there isn't a wide variety of docks, cases and accessories. It deserves a 4 but not a five because of fixable downsides.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good battery life, excellent sound quality, great FM Radio w/ lots of features. Video is good quality. The click wheel is nicer compared to the Ipod nano's. The price is around 50 dollars cheaper that the Nano per gigabyte.. 
Cons:. The software to get videos and pictures on the device is stupid; no drag and drop. A non removable battery is also a pain.. 
Summary:. The device is nice, fits nice in your pocket, and your hand. The rear is scratch free after many drops. Very good device for the price!. Hey, that rhymes!. 

$$;
Pros:. great display screen, voice recorder, FM radio capability, price, expansion slot. 
Cons:. it doesn't have internet access. 
Summary:. I finally bought the Sansa Fuze from www.shopsansa.com and I am so happy with it. I chose the 8gig Silver model priced at a mere $129.99. I also found a promo code ("forum211") on the net so I got 10% off of the order. This price was too good to pass up. The features are outstanding and the quality is a notch above the rest. I especially like that if I run out of space I can buy a microSD card to expand my memory. Perfect!. 

$$;
Pros:. Rhapsody compatible, size, battery life, good feel/weight. 
Cons:. Sound quality is good but not great, lacks some common interface features. 
Summary:. I purchased the 8GB Sansa Fuze from Best Buy, I didn't want to wait for Amazon inventory. I also own a Cowon iAudio u3 mp3 player, which has much better sound quality comparatively but I had problems getting the iAudio to work with Rhapsody to Go.. The Fuze is a great form factor. 8GB is plenty for me since I like to change out my music frequently especially with Rhapsody to go. I will probably get a microSD card to add another 4-8GB of 'non-rhapsody' music at some point so it's nice that it supports memory expansion.. Out of the box I had no problems connecting to Rhapsody, this was with firmware V01.01.07A. In addition to the battery icon it has another icon which indicates the license status which is helpful reminder when you need to connect the player back to Rhapsody to update the licenses before they expire.. The sound quality is good, but not great. I would say that my U3 player has 'great' sound when paired with a lower-cost set of Shure IEM earphones. What I did with my fuze was I got a better pair of dual driver Ultimate Ears headphones and that combo (Sansa fuze and UE headphones) is still pretty good and enjoyable.. The interface is simple and easy to use, easy sometimes at the expense of lost functionality: I can't show file properties (bitrate, date created, etc) and I can't delete an album (can only delete one song at a time when unconnected from PC).. It's easy to add playlists from Windows Media player or Rhapsody, but it's hard to create a new playlist on the fly when you are disconnected.. It doesn't support compilation feature like in ipods, so adding compilation albums can clutter the artist list.. That said, I love this mp3 player mostly because it works great with Rhapsody To Go. I can select any music available on Rhapsody and take it with me. Given the cons above, I think 8-9 is a good rating for *Rhapsody-To-Go users*, I'd probably rate this as 6-7 if I didn't use Rhapsody, and I'd probably recommend/use a different player.. At the time of this review, I couldn't find any protective skins for the Fuze, so if that and other accessories are important, you should check on accessory availability first before purchasing this.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bought it specifically to use for audio books. It works fine.. 
Cons:. The audio book feature could put books in an incorrect folder and even put chapters in loose. Looking at the "Tree View" of the Sansa on the computer you can guide where it goes and create your own folders to collect the book chapters in.. 
Summary:. Works great. Easy to navigate. Just be careful to get the entire book when downloading books from internet. Battery life is great. Sound is great. Price is great. Screen is small for viewing video or pictures - but great for our use.. 

$$;
Pros:. multi-functional. fm tuner. photo, video, music, it records, a lot of bells and whistles. Takes a sd card. Charges from usb port. It's compact, seems like just the right size, pretty thin and partly rubberized,. You just can't beat the price. 
Cons:. seems to freeze a little to often. a bit of a learning curve. Maybe too many bells and whistles. Does not include an a/c charger (optional). Can't do anything with it while charging from usb port. Not Mac compatible but can do the intel windows.. 
Summary:. Like I saw someone write "anything but an ipod". You get a fm tuner built in. It's the biggest bang for the buck on the block. What else would you want except massive storage, but i am sure the sd cards will continue to store more. 

$$;
Pros:. sleek design, battery life not too bad.. 
Cons:. screen could be a little more crisp. not sure if it can be connect to an ipod dock.. cannot customise the home screen other than changing the color in which it olny has about 5 colors to choose from.. 
Summary:. i've had this about 3 days now. i like it thus far.. not too sure about the connector on the bottom because it looks as though it could be the same as the ipod. im still researching that.. overall, its slim and nice looking. this is my first review ever. i bought this at costco for $49. not too bad. this is my first sansa mp3 player. i hope i like it.. i would like the screen to have that crisper look.(con). not typically a good video viewing mp3 player, but i did purchase it soley for music so it all works out.. 

$$;
Pros:. Micro SD slot, cheap, durable, good battery life. 
Cons:. Photos and videos have to be converted; why? and photos are selected one at a time, not a whole folder of pictures. Why?? Can't go back while playing a song to the album with a single click; iRiver allows you to. Conversion software is a pain.. 
Summary:. I got mine (4GB) for $60 and have added an 8GB SD card. Top that for the price! CNET's review says almost nothing about the Sandisk Media converter process; it's no fun to use and is a big download. Deleting a photo or song can be done but it seems to take forever if you use the player itself to do so. Who cares what color it is? The screen is NOT dingy, and who ever records voice with one of these?? CNET reviews are pretty weak, and outdated too.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1) User-friendly interface, with easy navigation through menus and songs.. 2) The outer shell doesn't look half bad.. 3) Since it's a flash-based player, you can sync music to it through any computer.. 4) Exceptional battery life.. 
Cons:. 1) The menus and, well, basically every screen looks dingy and uninspired.. 2) Sports a small screen that isn't any good for watching movies or viewing pictures or album art.. 3) Doesn't hold near as many songs as advertised.. 4) Hard to turn on.. 
Summary:. Before ever getting the Sandisk Sansa Fuze, I got the Sandisk Sansa Clip, the smallest of the Sansa family. I enjoyed its sound quality, and in general, I was satisfied with it as a whole since I was an amateur at buying and comparing MP3 players (i.e. I was impressed with whatever was cheap and shiny). When I returned the Clip due to USB port malfunctions, I purchased its big brother: the Sansa Fuze (2GB black). During the year I spent with it, I was overall satisfied with the Fuze, and I didn't have many complaints with it.. Here are the pros:. 1) The scroll wheel used on the Fuze is a wonderful device that works like a charm, making navigation through menus and songs a breeze.. 2) The Fuze has a slim and sexy look to it, making it feel like a quality competitor to larger competition.. 3) One of the complaints I have about iPods and Zunes (the big boys in the MP3 player market) was that you had to have one specific computer to operate and sync music to the device. Not so with the Fuze. Since it is a flash player, you can easily hook it up to any computer, install the software (don't worry- no disk is required for installation), and sync music. Easy as that.. 4) The Fuze sports a battery life unmatched by competitors. Of all the many MP3 players I have owned, this has to be the best of them all. I could go four to five days without a single charge. Now THAT is quality.. Even with an outstanding battery life and the compatability with multiple computers, the Fuze did fall short of perfection, as do we all. Here are the things I found distasteful in the Fuze:. 1) The menus installed into the Fuze aren't that striking, and the font used in the menus isn't large and, along with that, not very legible either. The screen as a whole, to me, has somewhat of a dingy feel.. 2) The screen on the Fuze is so small that is takes the fun out of viewing movies or pictures. Looking at the small pictures of the album art that corresponds with a song makes you squint to see it. Needs a bigger screen.. 3) My main complaint with the Fuze is that the five hundred songs it's supposed to support is a lie. Mine didn't hold two hundred songs, and even when I deleted forty songs, a video that was pre-installed with the device, and the pre-installed pictures, I didn't get any memory back. I could delete all I wanted and I would still have the same amount of memory that I had with however many songs I deleted. That was a rip-off.. 4) This is only a minor gripe, but it's worth bringing up: the on/hold switch is a hassle to operate, and sometimes I'd have to try three or more times to even turn the Fuze on. Very annoying.. Even though the Fuze isn't the most profound player on the market, it should prove to be a great flash-player for anyone who likes a cheap price and quite a few features, such as the micro-SD slot. Overall else, the Sandisk Sansa Fuze is a great little player, and I would highly recommend it to new comers looking for a simple MP3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good audio quality. Expandable memory. Easy to use. Reasonable price. 
Cons:. Screen is bad. Scratches easily. Glitches after a while, has to drain battery. battery life shortens over time. Sliding power button can cause problems, turns on in pocket and drains battery life. 
Summary:. Not anything special, but it does it's job.. 

$$;
Pros:. FM Tuner, Voice Recorder, good price, SD extension slot, Nice turn wheel.. 
Cons:. Interface is not quite as nice as iPod, Horrible for mac users(not compatible with iTunes, and Rhapsody is PC only software), plastic(doesn't scratch as easy as metal, but does break easier), can't play games.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good FM reception, other features work well too. 
Cons:. Can you say "White Screen of Death" ? Be prepared for whitescreen freezeups that force you to turn off &#38; back on when changing volume or deleting recording. We have tried 3 Fuxes and they all whitescreen one time or another, even w/ latest firmware.. 
Summary:. I like it functionally, but I'm looking for a replacement from another brand that also has FM so I can record radio shows &#38; listen later.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features for playing mp3 music and radio. 
Cons:. Multiple features complicate usability. 
Summary:. In most respects, the Sansa Fuze is a great mp3 player. And the audiobook feature is a great idea. However the implementation of this feature is so badly broken that the feature is unusable.. Problem 1 - It sorts track numbers incorrectly, putting tracks 1-9 at the bottom of the list.. Problem 2- It is difficult to navigate between tracks. The buttons do not function as they do for music.. Problem 3 - It automatically leaves bookmarks in the middle of files and then skips to the bookmark. If you lose your place and search a file and then go back and find your place in the previous file, when it gets to the end of that file, it jumps to where you last played the next file. This problem is exacerbated by Problem 2.. I had to resort to using the music folder for audiobooks. If Sansa can provide a firmware fix for these problems, the Fuze would make an excellent player for listening to audiobooks.. I encountered one other gatcha with the USB mode in the System Settings, which lets you select MTP or MSC. I had no idea what either of these were and none of the documentation from Sansa had any information about what these acronyms stand for or why I would want to choose one or the other. The default is Auto Detect, whatever that means. What I found is that it didn't work very well with the Windows file system. You only need to use the MTP setting if you have music with DRM (digital rights management). If you don't have music with DRM, you will want to change this setting to MSC. But before you do that, you might want to connect the device and delete any files you don't want to use. When you connected in MSC mode, your computer can't see the files that were loaded in MTP mode.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. Does not sound so good as I expected.. 
Summary:. Well I went to the Fuze cos I've been reading a lot of good things about it, including that it should sound better than the Ipods. Well, not true. I use to listen to my music in my cell phone - Sony z530i. I have cx500 earphones. The sound coming out of my cellphone is much more rich, bass are bigger, highs are more detailed. The EQ features in fuze are poor. High frequencies, poor. Low end, not fat enouth. For those who are seaching for something "almost"as good as analogic will be disapointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. I really like this player- nice size, weight, and all, and preferable to other players similiar- ipods that require itunes and only can sync w one computer and other mp3 and 4 players w smaller screens or not as many features.. 
Cons:. i can't get it to play all my songs!!. 
Summary:. I only download w windows media player and some of the songs play alright, but prolly half to two- thirds the player skips right over! as soon as it finishes a song that it will play, it'll show the album art, title, etc. of the next song and before it has even played for one second it moves on to the next song and so on until it finds a song it likes! i can;t find any rhyme or reason to the songs it chooses to play and those it doesn't, except that if it doesn't play one song out of an album, it won't play any. that doesn't apply to genre, however. SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP! i've already taken one back to the radio shack where i purchased it and had it exchanged, and the second one is doing the same! i'm going to try again tomorrow w a third, but will someone please tell me if maybe i'm doing something wrong, did i just get TWO defective players or is this not worth th hassle that its already been? am i going to keep having this problem?. 

$$;
Pros:. Good features and design for the price. I'd rank it second to the iPod in form factor and navigation and interface compared to Creative and Samsung devices that I've also tried. The FM reception is better than any other device I've used.. 
Cons:. The Fuze and Clip simply cannot play back all mp3 files at an accurate speed. After 1 1/2 months of wrangling with Sandisk, one of their technical reps admitted that the devices have hardware limitations that cannot play back all files accurately.. 
Summary:. I already owned a Sansa Express that I was pleased with and decided to buy a Fuze and a Clip to take advantage or some design and navigation improvements in the Sansa product line-up.. As soon as I got the devices, I upgraded the firmware and formatted the storage. After they were fully charged and prepped, I loaded all the files I wanted, most of which were already loaded on the Express.. One day, I was listening to a downloaded mp3 file of a radio program podcast (http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2007/05/25/06) through Windows Media Player while working at my computer. I had to run some errands and wanted to pick-up the playback at the same point on my Fuze as I was out and about. I had already loaded the same file to the portable device. I advanced the file to the same point and noticed that the files were not playing at the same speed.. The Fuze player was gaining approximately .75 seconds for every one minute of playback on the computer. The effect is subtle but noticeable if you play the files back simultaneously or consecutively. I wasn?t sure which was accurate so I compared the results to a stopwatch and several other portable players (Creative, Samsung, iPod and the older Sansa Express). Every other player and every program on my PC (Media Player, iTunes and Real Player) played back the files accurately.. I contacted SanDisk and confirmed that I had the latest firmware and reformatted the Fuze. The Fuze also has a blunt playback speed option and I confirmed that it was set to Normal (as opposed to Slow or Fast). I also confirmed that the bit rates were all above 32kbps. SanDisk told me to exchange the device with the retailer.. I did and the new Fuze has the same problem. I then got a manual firmware upgrade from one of SanDisk?s technical reps and again reformatted the Fuze and even re-downloaded the files from their original sources before loading them on the device.. The Fuze still gains approximately .75 seconds for every one minute of playback on any other device for mp3 files. WMA files playback nearly accurately, in that they lose approximately one second for every ten minutes of playback compared to any other device.. The Clip loses approximately .75 seconds for every one minute of playback on any other device for both mp3 and wma files.. The Express plays accurately.. I even sent the files to a SanDisk tech rep and he acknowledged that the files don?t play accurately. He said that for the Fuze and Clip, the hardware could not accommodate all the variations in files that I might encounter. I expressed dismay that all the other manufacturers seem to have solved this problem and even the older Express plays accurately.. Even more shockingly he said that his engineers were working on a new firmware upgrade to be released next year but they were not confidant that it would solve this problem. Additionally he said that, since SanDisk is moving more in the direction of developing ?Slot? players it would probably never solve the problem on the hardware side.. Other than that, I prefer the form factor design, navigation and interface on the Sansa devices to all others except the iPods. I?d recommend that they get rid of the separate home button by merging this function to the central button for holds of more that two seconds.. The features available are better than any other device for the money. I appreciate the ability to record FM transmissions and the additional micro card memory slot. FM reception is also better than any other device I?ve tried. The sound quality is second only to the Creative devices I?ve tried but better than iPod, Sony or Samsung (but stay away from the clumsy equalizer presets).. Obviously, I?m disappointed that the geniuses at SanDisk don?t care that their otherwise fine devices do everything well except the primary thing they were designed for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice Device, great price. 
Cons:. It's not what I was told I was buying.. 
Summary:. I went shopping for an MP3 at Best Buy. I'm a long time Rhapsody user, so when the Sansa Fuse was presented to me and I was told it was compatible with Rhapsody to Go, I bit. But after spending most of the afternoon trying with no success to download tracks, after switching my account to Rhapsody to Go and after spending an hour with Rhapsody tech support on Sunday, I took the thing back. But just to check, I went onto Rhapsody's site to look at the list of approved devices and guess what? The Fuze isn't listed, even though the software that comes with it includes the Best Buy Music store powered by Rhapsody. So I sent an email to Rhapsody support and this is what they told me: "I regret to inform you that the device Sansa Fuze is not compatible with Rhapsody. As Rhapsody continues to grow, we hope to add this device to the compatibility list." Apparently the tech I shared an hour with didn't know that. Buyer beware, especially a Bes Buy buyer.. 

$$;
Pros:. good size, intuitive platform. 
Cons:. video on SD card will crash player. What's the point of expandable media that won't play. Will exchange and get an IPOD touch..
