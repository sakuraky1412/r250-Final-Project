$$;
Pros:. Small, lightweight, &#38; great to have on hand for when you don't want to lug your camcorder around. 
Cons:. Not the greatest image quality, poor software design. 
Summary:. I've had this camera for several months now, and have greatly enjoyed using it. It's perfect for slipping in your pocket and capturing video when you wouldn't typically want to haul a camcorder with you. The still picture image quality is pretty poor (think lower-end cell phone camera), and the MPEG-4 video at highest quality is comparable to the WAV files created when I dump my camcorder MPEG-2 video into my computer and save it at lower resolution. So I'd not recommend it for capturing the most important moments in your life, but for capturing video on a whim it's perfect, and an unobtrusive alternative to a bulkier camcorder.. My biggest complaint relates to the software. The editing software bundled with the product is not user-friendly, and its conversion of the ASF format to WAV files results in a high loss of image quality. Worse still, the ASF format in which video is recorded cannot be played on computers lacking the necessary Panasonic codec. That codec is provided in the software that comes with the camera, but cannot be downloaded for free from the Panasonic website. Result: you can email those fun little videos to your friends, but unless they also own a DSnap camera and have installed the necessary software, they won't be able to watch the files! In addition, even if you have the codec, you'll not be able to view or edit your video in third party software (including Windows Moviemaker) unless you can convert the file to something other than the native ASF.. The only solution I have found to this codec problem is to download (for free) the "Windows Media Encoder" software from Microsoft's website. You can then convert your ASF files into WAV files that any Windows user can view using Windows Media Player, and that you can edit in movie-editing software. (This process also typically reduces the video file size, which helps when emailing.) Unlike the Panasonic software, Windows Media Encoder also converts the file without any appreciable loss of image quality.. I haven't yet tried the feature allowing you to record TV onto the device for viewing later, but that's next on my list!. So, all in all I'm a big fan of the DSnap, and would happily recommend it to anyone for whom the highest image quality is not an essential requirement. Just don't forget to download Windows Media Encoder!. 

$$;
Pros:. It looks cool and it's small. 
Cons:. Poor picture and video quality. 
Summary:. I got mine for $129.00 ($229.00 with $100 rebate). Bottom line is, you get what you pay for. It looks great, it's small, and it's fun. Picture and video are okay. I give it a 8 because for the price, it's great! If you are looking for professional 10 mega pixel or HDTV quality video, $129 bucks is not going to do it for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Multi-featured; digital camera, digital video recorder, MP3 player AND it records from any external device with the incluced RCA connectors. I think it`s great. I`m planning a 6 month bike trip, (from May to October, 2005), and it meets all my specificati. 
Cons:. Due to it`s very compact size some of the features, (the jog ball is very sensitive, and the camera lense release latch is a bit tricky), however for a first effort Panasonic has done quite well, when you maintain realistic expectations.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size packs many features Documentation is comprehensive Included software is easy to use. Impressive battery life. I've been using it nearly everyday for six months and the reliability has been 100%.. 
Cons:. None for me. If you read the specs before you buy, you'll know whether or not this product is for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is one of the coolest products I've seen in a long time. It's small enough to take with me everywhere. I had it in my pocket skiing and totally forgot about it. People always want to check it out. I like the feel in hand too. The video quality may. 
Cons:. Video quality isn't as good as similarly priced products but the compact size makes up for that. The user interface takes a little getting used to.. 

$$;
Pros:. A tiny all-in-one that is easy to carry around and cool to show my friends. The pictures and video are better than my digital camera. It's also great to have MP3s/music. I like it better than the AV-10 I played with. It's exactly what I was looking for. 
Cons:. SD card is too small. Get atleast a 128 card. It has a lot of powerful features but takes a few minutes to figure them all out. 

$$;
Pros:. It has a sleek design with many features. Good for a young avid photogrpaher wanting to just take pictures and shoot a couple of clips. The design is the biggest turn on with it being small and compact easy enough to carry in a purse or pocket.. 
Cons:. The quality is not the best but what would you expect for having so many features in one tiny camera. the 2 megapixel isnt the greatest and movies are somewhat bad to say the least.. 

$$;
Pros:. I known for many years that Panasonic is one of the most innovative companies in the world, they are not always good in promoting what they invented, however. The SV-AV50 is another example. You know it has to be advances cause it is made in Japan and m. 
Cons:. Chaging is only via the dockig station, which could be improved. Also the 'release' button which released the lens to flip back to the body, was kind of hard to access. I would not have done without my new 1 GB SD media chip so better get 1 for yourself. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size, feature rich. You'll never miss a moment and you don't need a "Bag" to truck it around in. Good pictures for on the go and "Spur of the Moment" shots. If you're missing those Kodak moments because of size and ability this has it all....for it'. 
Cons:. Small buttons, PC interface is not the most intuitive. Longer battery life would be great. The included SD stick is worthless.....don't buy this unless you're also getting the 256 or 512 SD card.. 

$$;
Pros:. Many features- Video, Still pics, mp3 player, video recorder (although i haven't fooled around with that yet). Takes good still pictures. Video is acceptable for what I use it for (right onto the internet), Tiny...and i mean it- its about the same size. 
Cons:. The major problem I have with the camera is that it suffers taking video and pictures in low lit envirnments. I'm experimenting with a LED flashlight attached to my head when I try to video outdoors at night...but i probably look like an idiot. Camera w. 

$$;
Pros:. I purchased this little gem about two weeks ago, and have had nothing but fun with it. It is so small and compact you can take it anywhere. It's great for shooting home movies, or casual shots of the family. The control menu is easy to learn, even my w. 
Cons:. 8 Mb SD card - What am I supposed to do with this? I holds about 1 minute of video. Poor display resolution. The flash whites out anything you try to photograph with in two feet. The night video mode makes the camera shots choppy. The lens position takes.

Pros:. I was able to get an early ship unit on E-Bay. All around quality is great--and video mode options make for the ability to select whatever resolution you want. 3 Zoom levels are also nice to have as options. Auto flash is adequate for close subjects. M. 
Cons:. No image stabilization. You have to charge through the dock. Even though the dock is small, it would be nice to leave it attached to the pc and have a travel charger. Maybe this will come later as an accessory!? Battery also has to be charged while in ca. 

$$;
Pros:. MP3s, Voice Recorder, Camera, Video Camera, Flash, relatively loud speaker, easy to use menus. 
Cons:. low picture/movie camera. 
Summary:. I bought this camera based on its vast amount of uses. The mp3 player is great. The only negative thing about the whole package is the video and picture quality. At 2mp the camera just isnt up to par. It produces grainy/dark images unless you are in bright sunlight. The video also is blurry and very pixelated. It looks fine on the lcd screen but when imported onto a computer, the quality is definitely lacking. This camera however is great for its portability and small size. I used it when hanging out with my friends, biking, skiing, or whenever we would need to capture somebody doing something stupid. It is ideal for these situations but it is definitely not the camera for someone looking to make high quality recordings or home-movies.. 

$$;
Pros:. Highly integrated 4 in 1 device. Every party I whip it out, I spend 10 mins explaining what it is. That is where it ends. Sunny Day toy is its best description as it takes great shots outside. Plug in 1Gig SD and get 5,450 640x480 or 1,780 1280x960 shot. 
Cons:. No match for a DV Cam solution, having a faster CCD. Indoor video and cam shots are VERY grainy - FRUSTRATING, considering that personal shots are priceless. Flash OVER brightens subjects. No dynamic Zoom is terrible!! I Love the concept yet Hate the 2M. 

$$;
Pros:. if you are looking for a product to replace your camcorder, mp3 player and digital camera this is not for you. If you want a cool toy that can do all 3 ok but none of them great this thing is perfect. It is small and farily easy to use. Battery life is. 
Cons:. Jog ball is way to sensative and videos are hard to share with friends.. 

$$;
Pros:. pros, its fairly small to carry in your pocket. it gets alot of attention if you like that sort of thing. um...well with the 100 rebate its an okay purchase. it ends up being about 150+ship AR.. 
Cons:. no way is this worth the full retail of 400. cam quality, think cell phone cam. yeah im serious. it's like a cell phone cam. the flash sucks, if too close it whitens the image to where it's unrecognizable. too far and it doesnt light anything. vid qualit.

Pros:. Compact design, MP3 player, Still photos of fair quality, recorder, rechargable battery.. 
Cons:. Horrible flash, poor shell(I don't like plastic), no red eye reduction, poor megalpixels of 2.0, Video is of no quality. THIS PRODUCT IS ONLY MEANT FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT A COOL GADGET. DON'T BUY IT IF YOU WANT IT FOR THE CAMERA. TRY OUT A PANASONIC LU.

Pros:. Built-in MP3 player and nice headphone control unit. Can record TV programs and play back, nice. Adequate Digital camera but needs optical zoom.. 
Cons:. Cannot zoom in camcorder mode. Mpeg4 quality is poor and out of focus. Built in speaker is poor Docking cradle is poorly constructed and feels like it may break. Cannot take pictures without finger getting in the way. Battery lasts only 1 hour if that. Ma.

Pros:. Small &#38; Compact Voice, Camera &#38; Video in One. 
Cons:. Awful, Awful, Awful Video quality (even on the highest setting) Zoom is awful Choppy movement, reminds me of video taken from the 70s. Photos are ok, but dark.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, great idea trying to put it all in one.. 
Cons:. Very hard to work the mp3 player and upload files to it. Video is no better then my digital camera. Pictures are dark in low light. I would not waste your time buying this product. I give it two thumbs down!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact size for a device that has so many capabilities: Audio player, camcorder, still camera, voice recorder.. 
Cons:. "MP3 Player" and "Night View" are untruths. This device DOES NOT play MP3 files and Night View does not work in the night. The Night View feature actually needs light; but when you activate "Night View" your video quality is USELESS. I saw other reviews a. 

$$;
Pros:. Neat Gadget. Easy to use. It will get you alot of attention but that's about it.. 
Cons:. Terrible video and pictures. I bought it on vacation at radio shack hoping to get video of my children playing on the beach. Instead I got whatlooked like a very poor quality 1940's video. Even on the highest quality setting. Not a good selection if you. 

$$;
Pros:. Great concept an all in one device, its what we all dream of. Super compact fits in a shirt pocket re-chargable battery. The ability for video to go strait to SD(if you can call it video).. 
Cons:. Here we go, I bought this product online Through Best Buy I was excited I wanted a camcorder and a digital cam. I found this was perfect for my need 2 for 1. WRONG, This thing gets worse video than a webcam seriously! It's choppy, dark indoors, the 3 not.
