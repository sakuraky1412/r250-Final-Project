people will typically more likely review something that is bad is all area of life .
these bad reviews are not really fair to how good this hard drive is .
i owned 1 for over half a year , bought two more about a month ago and i plan on buying 1 more next month -LRB- i just like to have two hard drives to mirror each other in case one fails , i still have the other with the same data , i would do this with any company 's hard drive -RRB- .
none of then have failed so far .
the 1tb is plenty of space for most people with videos and photos they wan na backup .
i am happy with my freeagent xtreme hard drives .
because they have been good to me so far and have plenty of space for my uses .
multiple input connections .
error free .
not one problem in over a year .
i have been an is professional for almost 30 years and i believe that the 3 freeagent xtreme drives i purchased are well worth the money i spent -LRB- there are .
better .
drives available but at what cost .
a drive failure is always possible -LRB- i have experienced those too -RRB- and therefore it is foolish to only have a single copy of valuable data -LRB- regardless of the media -RRB- .
i purchased 3 drives to use as follows .
1 -RRB- onsite backup of data that i would like to have available but wouldn .
t kill me to lose -LRB- i .
working copies of video editing , professional articles that i might want to refer to again but could be downloaded again , etc .
2 -RRB- onsite backup of data that i consider critical or non replaceable -LRB- i .
family photos/video , financials , etc .
3 -RRB- offsite backup of data that i consider critical or non replaceable .
the drives i purchased are not used continuously so they may not experience the same wear tear that you may experience .
not to minimize the frustration and cost to those that have experience drive failures but i wonder what the failure rate is for these drives since there probably have been millions sold .
1 of the 3 freeagent xtreme drives is dropped off a 3 .
desktop onto a concrete floor while being used with no damage to the plastic enclosure and no loss of data i do find it frustrating at times to wait while the drive .
wakes up .
after not being used for a period of time but i also appreciate the energy savings from it .
sleeping .
when not being used bottom line is to pick the drive that best fits your needs -LRB- which for most people include price -RRB- .
i is able to find a deal and only paid $ 140 for each 1 .
5 tera drive and since they haven .
t failed , i .
m happy .
i is fortunate to buy this after seagate provided 64 bit support for vista premium .
the drive has worked great so far using the firewire connection .
esata worked fine until the computer went into hibernate .
when it started back up it would not recognize the drive .
i switched to firewire and everything has worked fine .
inside these drives may have their 7200 .
11 series drives that had a serious firmware issue .
the internal serial number shows up in the back up log .
contact seagate or go to their website to see if that serial number is affected .
that 's probably what caused the other reviewers to be so negative .
i have had the drive for less than a week , and so far all has been good .
after installing the included software bundle , it checked for updates , and the new version available does not support vista 64 bit i could not believe it .
an included esata cable would be a nice addition in the box as i 'm sitting here typing this , my system is backing up to the drive approximately 800gb .
its been a few hours now and it has completed 11 .
9gb so far .
i would recommend getting a esata cable at the same time you pickup the drive if your system supports esata that is .
i liked seagate .
i bought 3 of these .
1 suffered complete and utter self destruction just after filling to the halfway point .
luckily , because of my problems with wd 's mybooks i have a pretty thorough backup regime seagate has a very easy and fast exchange policy -LRB- i guess these fail at such a rate that an automated exchange policy is warranted -RRB- which is nice but the replacement drive came doa .
luckily , their exchange the exchanged drive program works well also bottom line the drive works great when it works and falls hard when it fails think of that line from clint do you feel lucky .
do not buy a seagate product they have zero warranty .
when this drives crashes and it will you will lose evrything on it there is no way to rescue data .
i went through four free agent hard drives .
even before each failed , they were very noisy and each made chugging sounds as the drive spun .
customer service is very helpful and did not quibble about sending three replacement hard drives -LRB- even ones with larger capacity -RRB- after each began to fail .
however , as if reading from a script , each of the customer service technicians kept saying that these disks should not be used for primary storage but only for back up .
i kept telling myself that i would buy another hard drive to back up the back up drive but never got around to it .
sure enough , when the final drive failed , i lost 800 gigs of data and now i am shopping for data recovery services which will set me back at least $ 600 .
i later discovered that many others have had the same problem .
-LRB- see free agent user reviews on the costco website -RRB- in retrospect , i have no doubt that seagate knew that these drives were a problem .
i would check customer reviews more carefully before buying another external hard drive .
easily installed for synchronized backup of another 1tb drive .
after 6 weeks of operation , began making ticking noises , failed seagate manager tests , froze during chkdsk repairs , and finally failed to be recognized at all .
returned for replacement .
new drive tested weekly , and failed seagate manager tests after 6 weeks .
also failed chkdsk repair .
to be replaced under warranty again .
thanks to synchronized backup set up , i can afford to lose 1 drive for a short time , but this is proving to be an unreliable hard drive .
dont buy seagate .
started clicking , and when i rebooted it , it would not come up again .
total brick .
i am a professional computer technician with over 15 years experience in pc hardware repair and trouble shooting .
i am a + , net + , ccna and mcse certified .
i have worked on some of the most prestigious projects on 4 continents .
i would n't even recommend giving this to the neighbors dog to chew on , even if it is barking all night the product is that bad .
do not purchase this drive .
first , the esata interface is poor and flaky .
i bought this drive specifically for that reason and it frequently just dropped the line .
apparently , seagate sets the power settings to just 10 minutes by default .
a professional series , large volume drive that powers down after 10 minutes .
using their recommended guidelines , i hooked it up via usb and is able to use the seagate software to adjust the power settings , to no avail .
even after i powered it down , changed the input back to esata and turned it back on , it still flakes out secondly , using the usb interface for the drive is no better .
occasionally , it just drops out and my brand new , vista x64 , i7 920 hp computer can not recognize it or even see it in disk management thirdly , even when it does recognize the drive -LRB- if you unplug and replug it in several times , it eventually spins up -RRB- , there 's no guarantee you 'll be able to access the files so , what did i do .
in between my hectic schedule , i spent a week trying to figure out the problem .
finally , i sent it back to seagate for rma , which took another week .
then , i traveled to a customers site out of state for a week , returned , and it 's now having the same problem with the new one as the last one i do not have time to fool with a new hard drive that will not work .
i 've had it .
i will never buy another seagate product again .
i have installed hundreds of drives in the last 15 years and i 've seen hard drives that were practically melting that worked better , but i 've never seen a hard drive so poorly engineered and manufactured that it continues to cause flaky connects , file read errors and poor performance like i 've experienced with my new seagate xtreme 1 .
5 tb drive frankly , i 'm so frustrated with trying to trust this drive will eventually work , i want to throw the dam thing away and chalk it up to poor choices on my part .
i wish i had read this review forum before i bought that drive .
this is the worst product i 've ever bought never again , seagate .
and best buy , you should be ashamed for even carrying this drive .
do not buy it .
i used these drives to back up my business and now 2 of 3 of my drives are failing to read .
i use this drive to back up my macbook pro and use it as a time machine backup .
one day it just stopped reading the drive .
i took it to a data recovery center and they said there is something wrong with the hardware and the data cant be recovered .
do not buy it .
that 's it .
do not buy this .
plenty of similar reviews for this product can be founds around the internets junk expensive brick .
i bought one and last 43 days .
i lost my data seagate is the worst brand ever and they do not care about you losing your data do not buy that thing .
you 'll lost your data and do not works with 64 bits .
i have replaced this product twice under warranty .
the first two failed completely , the one i am using now keeps disappearing and i need to power cycle before using .
can not rely on it for back ups .
very dissatisfied .
do not buy seagate there drives are junk i replace my first one and now the second second just complete stop working not lights just tick , tick tick .
and since this drive last about almost a yr i thought i is safe to store things on and boy is i wrong and now my information is lost .
i hate seagate and will never ever purchase there product again .
this hard drive is the pitts .
this hard drive is the worst thing to happen since aids .
it will only last about 5 months and then quit .
seagate is one of the worst electronic manufactures in the world if not the worst .
i lost the receipt and box for this or else i would have returned it .
this thing is a lemon .
it still halfway works which is just painful for me because i never know when it will become useless and whatever i have not backed up from it will be lost .
but i also hate to think of the money i wasted on it .
customer service said they can give me a new one under warranty .
or pay $ 1 , 800 to $ 2 , 700 for them to try to get the data back .
best buy thinks that the motor just stopped on the drive so dead .
warranty does no good to replace my lost data .
rip off .
never again will i buy seagate .
save your valuable data and money do not buy .
i am a it software professional and i have had some experience with various hardware devices in the last 10 years .
here is my short review on my short experience with the seagate freeagent xtreme 1tb .
the drive crashed after 2 3 months of use and i lost all of my home data .
the data is of personal value .
if this would have been wok data , i would have been devastated .
this is presented as a somewhat professional device -LRB- this the higher price than other devices storing 1tb -RRB- and i would expect some companies to use as a backup device .
but i do not recommend it .
i have previously owned 3 external hard drives -LRB- various manufacturers -RRB- and only one of them ever crashed , after 1 .
5 years .
so this drive is by far the most unreliable of all the four drives .
this has convinced me to never buy seagate products again .
i have not ever bought an electronic product that crapped out after two uses .
and after reading the community board at seagate 's website , the constant beeping noise signifies the drive is fried and will need to be rma 'd .
i bought the 1 .
5tb drive , and i thought i could use it as a reliable source to hold my 10 , 000 + .
mp3 files -LRB- i 'm a professional dj -RRB- and not have to store them on my laptop harddrive , but i wish i had read these reviews first before i purchased the seagate , i can imagine going to do a show and all my song files are on the xtreme and it just beeps .
riiiiight .
oh well , lesson learned , note to self read reviews and research before i purchase an electronic product .
i wish i could just get a refund , because i have no confidence in the seagate hardware 's reliability and whatever they send me as a replacement will just sit unopened in the box .
stay , no run away from this product .
purchase from rectron in midrand gauteng south africa they can not support with data recovery .
only swapout offered .
spent several hours troubleshooting earlier today on the 1 .
5 tb version and seagate came to the conclusion that their seagate manager software is not compatible with the dell esata which means that power management , configuration , raid , etc .
, can not be used unless connected to slower ports such as firewire or usb .
there are several other esata drivers , etc .
, that the seagate manager can not play nice with but that information tends to be hidden until after purchase there is reduced operability of this device via esata on a dell using the vista interfaces such as windows explorer but drive will stay on 100 % of time with fans constantly running , etc .
1 -RRB- Good Warranty .
2 -RRB- Great Customer Service .
3 -RRB- eSata .
4 -RRB- Fat32 capable for Airport Extreme ; 1 -RRB- Noisy Hard Drive .
2 -RRB- Doomed To Fail USB , Firewire &#38; eSata connectivity options .
But ... ; Crashed after 90 days .
Will not start again .
Dead .
None - can not use device as designed , marketed or sold. ; Seagate Manager software can not be used on a Dell system using eSata .
Data connections ; Usless after 4 months , disk start making noise for 1 hour then totally usless !
No compatible with macs unless you hack it !
good paper weight ; it is a brick !
None if it 's just gon na crash right after you get it. ; Very unreliable .
Crashes , does n't last , and overheats EASILY .
Absolutely none ; Have found hundreds of failure post on several site .
Seagate will not back this product up Easy set-up , lots of storage ; eSATA dropped recognition when computer went idle .
Firewire and USB worked fine .
The color of the box it came in was n't too bad .
Nor the RMA boxes. ; Everything except the box it came in .
Wish it was still in it at Best Buy !!
Now I Finally realize why SEAGATE HAS 5 YR WARRANTIES , Not because there product was last 5 yr and will never need replacement .
WOW thank for the 5 years to bad i could n't even get through one. ; SEAGATE DRIVES IS A CON ITS SELF AND DONT TRY TO USE THE E-SATA IT WILL JUST SHUT OFF ON ITS OWN EVEN IF YOUR USING IT AND NO SECURITY U WILL LOSE YOUR DATA SO BACKUP YOUR BACKUP None .
I ca n't found anything good in lost all my data. ; Do not work with Windows 64 bit , Died after 43 days Sleek design , Cool LED array , Firewire , USB and eSATA connections , Easy setup and decent included software bundle. ; No eSATA cable included , Can only have 1 backup plan , new version of software bundle does not support Vista 64-bit .
USB , Firewire , eSata connections available . .
Design . .
Pretty silent. ; The drive crashed after 2-3 months of use and I lost all of the data .
The lights are pretty .
Pretty lights .
It 's a great lamp. ; Began clicking , corrupting files , and losing data within a month .
My computer constantly loses contact with it -LRB- may be on the OS side , but it lists my OS as compatible so I think it SHOULD be compatible then -RRB- .
None ... If it loses your data than what is the point to back it up ??
; Lost 3 years worth of family videos -LRB- Kids first day at school , birthdays , vacations , etc. -RRB- &#38; all computer backups .
Reliable so far .
5 year warranty if it does fail -LRB- best warranty of any hard drive company I know of -RRB- .
Small Compact size and easily stack-able design .
Attractive looking design .
7200 RPM .
Good backup program that comes on it -LRB- though I do n't use -RRB- ; 931 GB instead of actual 1,000 GB -LRB- Of course that 's typical of pretty much all hard drives -RRB- .
You have to go out and buy eSata separately .
It can store alot of information ; after 2 weeks it broke and will not stop making a beeping sound , and from what i have heard it hapens to most of these hard drives .
1 TB EXTERNAL DRIVE , USEFUL FOR BACKING UP DATABASES ; These drives are unreliable at 1and have a history of failing .
What 's even worse is dealing with the Customer Service at this company .
It 's like pulling teeth !
It 's taking over 1 month for me to get these hard drives replaced and over 10 phone calls .
There is nothing good about it. ; It shuts off if you do n't stay active in it so if you are using a media file for anymore than about 10 minutes then it will just shut off interupting what ever you are watching .
It also only last about 5 months Sleek design. ; Did n't buy it for the design .
It started making a constant beeping noise on power up and is dead in the water .
I have used it exactly TWICE since purchase .
I have two tB drives , plugged them into my USB ports and they have been working error free for months and months .
Fast enough for me to use them to play movies from them directly to my TV and very fast when copying large files from one to the other. ; I do n't dislike anything about this product .
It does what it is supposed to .
reasonably fast yet uses much less energy than older drives , especially when it `` goes to sleep '' when not being used .
I have also dropped one of these drives from a desktop onto a concrete floor without any harm -LRB- do NOT attempt this-I just got lucky ? -RRB-
; after not being used for a period of time , the drive `` goes to sleep '' and there is a delay while the drive `` wakes up ''
