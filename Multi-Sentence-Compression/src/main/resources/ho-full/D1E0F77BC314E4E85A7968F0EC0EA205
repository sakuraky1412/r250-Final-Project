we stayed at la quinta last august and i must say it was really a surprise despite i had read before very good comments .
hotel has a superb location : in the main street of santa barbara , close to shops , restaurants and bars , but a couple of blocks away from the heart of the nightly life , so quiet enough if you do n't want to be disturbed by noise .
beach is 15/20 minutes walking or 2 minutes if you take the turistic bus ( every 10 mins .
or so ) .
from the outside the hotel looks like a motel from the sixties ( which gives some charme ) , but the lobby and the rooms are entirelly renovated , and are not only `` new '' but also , in a modern & chich style .
we stayed in a room spacious enough for two adults and two children ( ages 10 & 13 ) in two very comfortable queen beds , with a very modern and complete bathroom ( shower was a gift after a busy day in santa barbara ) and all the usual amenities ( flat tv , coffe maker . . .
) .
i need also to mention the pool : not only my children loved it , but me and my wife enjoyed it very much swimming or having breakfast in one of the tables that sorrounded .
we had the impression of being in a movie of the 60 ' ! .
service was excellent both in check in and check out .
congratulations for your hotel .
it is a gift to find such an . . .
