At first I thought,wait a minute,no memory chip,no exchangeable battery,a few other diff .
Battery life is pretty spot on .
Fourth, your battery icon stinks .
NO USER REPLACEABLE BATTERY, , Unless you buy the extended warranty for $65 .
For one thing, there's no charge except battery power no pun intended !
3The battery definitely does not last two weeks on mine .
Turn wireless OFF ,  It saves your battery .
>> Better battery life, FAR better with wireless function on .
The battery charged quickly, in less than 2 hours .
The battery life seems amazing .
