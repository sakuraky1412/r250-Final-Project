there is no way anyone could be anything other than highly complimentary about the physical nature of the place .
suites are indulgent and beautifully maintained .
sometimes , its the `` minor '' aspects that are neglected which take the gloss off the stay , as my expectation to attention to small details is really important when you are paying this kind of money .
if you offer a turn down service , then it means turning down the bed , replacing the used towels and refreshing the room ; here , none of those things occurred but 2 muffins wrapped in plastic were left on the tv .
the looked a bit tacky actually , the type you buy in a convenience store .
wet towels were left to mar the room 's immaculate presentation , bathroom not refreshed , no water replaced and , worse , no ice reams left in the fridge ( which was what the room description said ) .
i know it sounds minor , but this is a 6* property and i felt the above was a significant service deficiency for the price point paid .
from this experience , i would not stay here again , nor recommend it , believing i should have researched more .
expectations unfortunately not met .
that is even despite the upgrade to a pool room on check in and reducing the resort cost .
and then the check out receptionist tried to over charge me for the couple of drinks taken from the mini bar , rather than re-considering charging at all , as the lead receptionist . . .

you just have to service-recovery when you can , and action what you promise , rather than embarrass the guest.
