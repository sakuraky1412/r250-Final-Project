its the baby of the sony's hdd camcorders and its worth the price  .

a great camcorder and good for beginners .

i purchaced this camcorder because i do mainly field work recording for industry related training and instructional videos  .

i needed a small unit that does not necessarily need to be of a totally professional nature  .

i also must do large amount of editing on a notebook that is configured as a portable editing station  .

i recently purchased a new workstation notebook that is vista capable , but is loaded with xp pro sp2 (release date of this notebook is april 25 , 2007) , because vista has many drivers and related updates that must be downloaded to be compatible with much of the professional editing software and actual gear available right now  .

all my other gear is xp based and the sony is easy to install and use and is completely compatible with the xp application  .

software included with the camera has performed well with no problems  .

quaility of the video is excellent and editing is simple  .

it is also quite handy to be able to use the camera like a portable hard drive to transfer video and stills  .

the nightshot plus has worked flawlessly with my applications and battery life is very good good all around camera for my uses and would be great for the home/casual user .

it , s pretty cool and compact  .

if you dont care about the picture i suggest you buy this because it is hdd .

i video horseback riding lessons and shows  .

the strength of the optical zoom is a great feature for close and distant shots  .

often use a tripod , but it is also handheld quite a bit  .

solid fit in palm alows me to hold it steady , no fumbling to zoom , start or stop  .

picture quality meets my expectations , and i cast a critical eye  .

i purchased bigger battery , but mostly use the battery that came with the handycam .

this camcorder is incredibly easy to use  .

i had it out of the box and after the battery charged (120 mins later) , i is testing the camcorder out all i did is set the easy function (explained in the manual) and i is using the camcorder in a matter of minutes  .

the touchpad viewfinder/monitor is awesome , and makes the camcorder extremely user    friendly  .

this really is a point shoot camcorder the docking station is very easy to hook up to the computer , by way of the provided usb cable  .

the video quality of the camcorder looks great on my computer (i'm using windows xp home) , and the audio quality is just as good as the video quality , on the computer i haven't tried hooking the camcorder up to my 40 lcd tv to see how the video looks on that , but i'm perfectly happy with the way it looks and sounds on my computer i haven't used the still image function on the camcorder and don't plan to  .

that's why i have a 5  .

0 mp digital camera  .

i use this camcorder strictly for video taking during trips , birthdays , vacations , family gatherings , etc i also have not tried the one button disc burn function yet  .

but i'll be trying that out some time soon this camcorder does have a few downfalls , described above , but the pros far outweigh the cons  .

also , if you're going to buy this camcorder , you might wanna consider putting out the money to get a good quality carrying case , and an extra battery overall , i'm extremely happy with the purchase of my new camcorder , and do not see myself needing another one in the near future .

i bought this to record one to five minute videos , and then pull them into blender for special effects  .

linux compatibility is a must  .

i plug the usb cable to the camera and to my debian linux laptop , and the camera appears as a file system  .

i just drag the video files onto the laptop  .

no proprietary windows drivers needed , although it does come with some software  .

picture and sound are good .

this is a video camera  .

if you want still pictures , then buy a still camera  .

the video is fantastic , and the option to choose what quality setting is perfect for what we needed  .

lowest quality gives me about 20 hrs of video , highest setting about 11 hrs  .

this little camera has exceded our expectations we have used it while out on the lake , on the ocean , and camping and hiking in yellowstone national park  .

it worked like a champ  .

it is light , small , and very convenient .

i first bought the sr42 1st , which is lower resolution and the widescreen features are not as good  .

so i upgraded to the sr82 (the sr62 is the same as the 82 but only 30 gig)  .

the sr42 is not bad , you get alot of features for the price , if you can live with less than perfect video quality the video on the sr42 is just slightly worse than my 10 year old sony tape handycam  .

i is using a 50 tv in my comparisons  .

so i got the sr82  .

the video resolution upgrade is much better on the 62 and 82 models  .

on a 42 inch tv or smaller this may be good enough quality for you the other thing i notice is the sr42 did not handle the widescreen the same way  .

when i recorded with the sr82 the picture filled my widescreen tv whereas the sr42 did not since 4  3 put black bars on the side and 16  9 had bars on the top and bottom  .

it seems as if the sr42 is 4  3 native and the widescreen mode is 2  .

35 to 1 aspect ratio which i did not like for home videos  .

the sr62 and sr82 are native 16  9 widescreen  .

they can also do 4  3 as well the activeshoe interface allows for adding infrared or microphone or lighting attachments the touch screen is nice and works well  .

it rotates 270 degrees  .

so you can flip it 180 degrees one way and fold it back towards the camera for doing playback or when connecting to the computer i did notice that the camera defaults to sp mode and not hq  .

so the highest resolution is not the default  .

just a heads up the battery gets you at least an hour of recording  .

there are larger capacity batteries available i use this camera in 2 difficult recording situations 1) recording my band  .

usually from far away  .

music really loud  .

varying lighting conditions (stage lights)  .

it works well but you must use manual focus 2) video taping my sons hockey team  .

hockey rinks are tough to get still pictures in as well  .

subjects are moving fast but flash cannot be used due to the glass along the boards  .

the netting also plays havoc with auto focus  .

the sony also worked well in this situation  .

i got good video using auto , snow and sports settings  .

i think the auto may be the best except when the metal halide lighting is too low in certain rinks it can cause varied brightness in the video overall a great camera at the price  .

cameras $100 more are probably better  .

but you get what you pay for  .

decide how much you want to pay and get the best camera in that range  .

this one seemed to be the best one in my range  .

plus i have always had good luck with sony products lasting for 10+ years  .

something i cannot say for just about every other brand i have tried  .

how much did i save when another camera is $50 cheaper but i have to replace it in 4 years .

average camcorder  .

nothing special , just compact  .

easy to use  .

not worth the price , but close .

overall , its performance seems very similar to that of my previous camcorder , a sony dcr    trv103  .

the small size and light weight are great benefits for my most common application , vacation travel reviewers of sony cameras in this same hard    drive storage category (last year's sr40 , 80 , etc  .

) universally complained about the lack of an eye    level viewfinder suitable for in    sunlight photography  .

they were very right  .

with these cameras , the limits of the frame are a matter of guessing , because you cannot see the image at all when there is a bright sun around  .

talk about point    and    shoot these cameras essentially require the user to do just that  .

i'd like to be able to buy a simple , easily attached hood to clip over the lcd , with a simple lens so i coulde put the camera up to my eye and view the lcd with it in near    darkness  .

even though i might not be able to operate the touch    screen (unless there were no bottom on the hood) , such an addition would do wonders for ability to aim , using the lcd , in sumlight .

if you want broadcast    quality video , get a broadcast    quality camera  .

the dcr    sr42 works fine as a grab    and    shoot camera which is what most people do regardless of what they say or purchase  .

i found it for $260 in a retail store  .

it's a lot of camera for $260 .

bias   i hate the touch screen  .

you don't get the option of not using it , and its a little more navigation than i'd like  .

but there's nothing wrong with it it works , its sensitive and etc , you just have to aim pretty well and not have big fingers or anything the one salvaging feature of this camera is that the video quality is sharper than the average (i also bought a panasonic sdr h18 at the same time) , although colors are a little pale  .

not too bad if you're not comparing it to anything , though it's very easy to connect to the computer , and video plays on any of your usual media players    no need to install software just to watch the video  .

dragging and dropping out of my computer is enough a con of the base is the connection   if you don't sit the camera on the base just right , it wo not charge    and while downloading videos onto the computer , the smallest nudge tends to break the connection also , zoom takes a little while to focus , and when playing videos back on my computer i notice that during zooming or if something is moving too quickly ,  the image gets pixelated lines in it   .

i tend to forget to close the lens after use , since there's no lens cap    just a switch by the lens i went with the panasonic equivalent , but is sad to leave behind the superior image sharpness  .

that's the only thing i'll miss , though .

i bought it and 3 days later returned it to the store  .

it had a loose screw inside , but that was not the main con , i could just exchange it  .

the picture quality is terrible for the money it cost  .

there better cameras out there for less money .

i received this camcorder as a christmas gift but it's being returned 1 day later the upside   it has a nice , small form factor and navigation within the camera controls are fairly straightforward via the touch    screen lcd  .

the included sony software is also decent but its not winning any beauty contests  .

movie files can be dragged to the desktop for viewing either on a mac or pc using the free (not included)vlc player  .

i have not edited any footage with this software yet now , the downside    .

1) video quality indoors is horrible , especially in low    light situations  .

lots of grain in the video as well 2) lots of motion    blur when filming anything moving 3) no imovie (mac) support without coverting the video and shelling out $30 to upgrade to quicktime pro so it can view mp2 files  .

shame on sony and apple for this  .

if you have not been exposed to imovie you should 4) the dock station is a great idea by sony but it just feels cheap and there is a crunching noise whenever i docked the camcorder  .

i'm certain this dock is doomed to fail and there is no other way to transfer the video to a pc without using the dock this is a camcorder for persons looking for easy who do not care about image quality that much  .

forget the sony brand ; its lustre is all but gone .

i decided i'd like to try the hard disc , and after having two excellent sony camcorders , this seemed like a good choice  .

luckily i is just back from vacation and is watching about 20 minutes worth of video taken with my older sony digital    8 camcorder when i decided to try the sr    42  .

i wanted to like it  .

i tried to like it  .

but the sr    42's picture quality is nowhere near what my digital    8 camcorder gives me aside from that , there are way too many features for still picture    taking  .

why on earth would someone buy this for that purpose  .

any 150 dollar camera will take better still    pictures than most any camcorder ah well , different strokes this camera might be good for a first    timer who is computer oriented  .

it goes back to the store , and i see no reason to move from my sony digital    8 to any other tape format .

i owned a dcr trv 110e which recently packed up and , being satisfied with previous sony products , (i have a vaio laptop , sony music system digicam)i decided to go for the relatively more expensive sr42e  .

big mistake  .

the video quality is pathetic  .

also , the'steady shot' feature is not very effective as the picture keeps shaking (much more than with my previous trv110e)  .

extremely disappointed with sony  .

i am left with the feeling that i paid much more for much less .

i returned it today to best buy  .

it did not work on os windows xp xp pro 64       very surprising  .

sony had no 64 drivers to download       hard to believe with a company this size when i returned it to best buy , they told me the sony rep is in the store  .

i approahed her with my dilemma  .

she had no clue what 64 bit is or what an operating system was  .

also she could not tell me what sony videocams supported 64 bit  .

hard to believe sony would send out reps to best buy with such little os literacy i am looking for another videocam with another company avoid this one brian  .

this camera is easy to use and compact enough to take anywhere , however sony does not offer a cable to connect the camera to their gx355 dvd recorder to burn in digital quality  .

only an rca jack is available for burning dvds other than to the dvdirect  .

i have searched , called sony and tried several stores to find a jack that would work  .

otherwise , the dvd video quality is terrible , less visible than vhs  .

sony should make a cable that makes these items compatible at digital quality  .

it is quite a waste of money to purchase digital technology to have analogue connections and poor quality dvds  .

i consulted sony before purchasing the dvr and they recommended that model for use with the sr42  .

i regret purchasing sony products .

even without the camera shaking the video moves around with the subject the focus is horrible , especially with front lit subjects , it moves in and out of focus not usable video 50% of the time not able to use external microphone cheap , when the video is not drifting around or going out of focus the quality is not bad  .

the super night shot is nice too but you have to use infinate focus for it to work at all  .

i would not waiste my money  .

there have been a lot of complaints about this product and the non    compatibility with windows vista , but sony does not seem to care .

i have always been a fan of sony , however this purchase will most likely be the last  .

video quality is poor , support on their website is awful , software wo not play back the video .

ideas behind the features are good , but all of the functions are such poor quality as to render them useless  .

the touchscreen is smudgy and small  .

the ir mode is very weak  .

the movie quality is as low as it gets and the still image quality is worse but here's the real pain ; upon downloading the movie files to the computer none of them are recognized by the computer until you get the proprietary software which is not included in the box and the download from the tech support site deadends i've received no reply from the sony tech support team  .

never going to buy another sony imaging product .

i bought this in a hurry without doing any investigation prior to my purchase because i is about to leave for my 25th wedding anniversary in europe  .

as i saw this in a best buy , i thought hey , it's a sony  .

it has to make great pictures  .

boy is i wrong and i wish i had taken my old digital 8 sony that makes vastly superior video this little gem does a remarkable job at recording great sound though  .

but if you need a sharp picture , stay away from this camera  .

i did like the ability of the camera to edit and remove unwanted video clips  .

it charges quickly and the learning    curve was not to bad for my 55 year old brain  .

still images were so bad , i gave up using it as a capture device and stayed with my casio camera instead .

i would definitely not recommend this sony dcr    sr42 .

i'm not going to start by shooting down sony with a comparison to any other manufacturer  .

i do have sony cameras and a pda that i am very pleased with , however this product does not represent anything remotely close to the quality of other items i own  .

if you are a current sony product owner you might just question if this camera is even a sony product sony should have saved themselves the embarrasement of having released such a p  .

my almost antique dsc    p1 camera takes better pictures and video i am more than dissapointed with everything about this camera , there is no reason anyone should buy it any digital camera with sd or memorystick storage is far supperior to this massive trinkitry i fell it is made purly on the demand of having something to submit to the hdd camera market , and holds no value to the consumer whatsoever the sawblade effect of the video will leave you wondering what you have just watched  .

while focused on finding what is wrong with the picture , you will be completely distracted from the events of the video .
