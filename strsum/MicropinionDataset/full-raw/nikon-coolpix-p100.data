looking at its price , design and features it is a great cam to buy  .

this camera is good for people who are on a budget and who don't want to go buy a very high    tech dslr  .
this camera is very professional  .
it is good for taking photos all the way from a simple portrait to a very interesting night landscape photo  .
i also want to point out one more pro  .
i love the fact that you do not have go out to the store and have to but aa batteries  .
i love the rechargeable batteries  .
this a good camera for starters and experts  .
i bought this camera because my wife and i are traveling to italy and have been pretty dissatisfied with our canon elph 6  .
0 megapixel  .
basically , the camera at low light settings came out horrible  .
we stumbled upon the p100 and instantly felt like we had to have it for our trip  .
since owning the camera , i have been playing with all of the settings , read the manual , and have been experimenting with close    up and far away shots  .
i have to admit that i have been really satisfied with this camera , and do not understand why people have been giving this camera poor reviews based on the photo quality  .
i understand that photo quality is a huge deal , but if you are going to be a stickler about photo quality then you should have forked over the extra $200 and got yourself a dslr (a mediocre one at best) , and have fun spending another $2    300 for a lens that gives you a long zoom i would definitely recommend this camera who is wanting a solid camera that will take a great photograph in any situation , without having to spend a ton of money .
21/4/2010 i bought this and i'm very happy  .
coz i got a nice camera nikon p100       )  .
before i bought this i read so many reviews about this product  .
ppl are giving good reviews for this product  .
and u see this camera its very sexy look  .
if u have this in your hand u got a very rich look on you  .
and this is my fist time i bought this zoom camera  .
i'm very happy and the price is $422  .
its worth .
in my opinion this camera is an extremely smooth , easy to use with heaps of optional functions the zoom is amazing and extremely accurate  .
i am a hobbyist who broke her dslr and wanted a cheaper replacement  .
i am very impressed with the quality of photos it takes  .
i know you get what you pay for , and this is no exception  .
if you want something nicer , go all out (and pay the money for it) , but if you just want a great camera that takes great , detailed images , this is it  .
i did not expect to be this happy with a downgrade from nikon's higher    priced cameras  .
thank you nikon .
good overall camera if you are not a camera buff  .
it works for me  .
however if you drop this thing it does seem to be to me not as strong as some .
the extreme light weight of the camera challenges the photographer's ability to hold the camera still  .
the vibration reduction feature , however , is superb and i have turned out very few unusable images due to camera shake  .
i like using the fine settings , and have been pleased with the flexibility and the ease of use of the p100  .
the new mirrorless capture technology is incredible in this camera  .
i bought this camera for someone else          but kept it for myself when i saw how it rivaled other cameras i have  .
i love it  .
just took this camera with me on a mediterranean cruise to spain , france , and italy and got some really nice shots with minimum hassle  .
the optical stabilization works great for photos and the scene settings seem to work well  .
i haven't played with the manual settings but they are there if i ever feel adventurous   ) i is able to get sharp shots in good light at full optical zoom with no tripod  .
the 26x zoom makes all the difference when trying to get that small detail  .
it does a fairly decent job with the hd video as long as you do not expect to be able to use the full zoom range without a tripod some photos (mostly low    light ones) look a bit grainy at 100% size , tho good at around 80% so if you consider this an 8mp camera , then it does an excellent job overall , this is a solid camera  .
i really like the pics i'm able to get with the big zoom and i'm able to overlook the rare annoyance for this .
get it  .
it is no bigger in size than my canon powershot (that i still adore) but much lighter than it  .
i am a mom of fast moving children , avid but amateur photographer and family archivist and historian , so i need a camera on me at all times  .
besides , i've purchased all of my hand bags for the last five years based on fitting my stuff and my camera  .
once you've had a canon powershot and enjoyed the speed of capture , the quality of the pictures , you cannot go backwards to the small pocket sized camera's  .
they just don't provide the same joy  .
now having moved to this nikon , well , that cemented it  .
my handbags will continue to be large and utilitarian because this camera is worth carrying around for every and all nikon moment that presents itself  .
the zoom is not as good as i expected , but i expect too much , it is certainly an awesome zoom and with it i captured a baltimore oriole that i have sat in my backyard for three years trying to get a shot of and never could , as i is lacking zoom , powershot , rebel , and all  .
i have a thing for photographing the moon  .
my powershot took awesome pics of it , you could see all the divits in it , enough that i wondered if nasa knew about that camera  .
the zoom on this nikon got in so close that the entire moon didn't even fit in the very large screen on the camera    and you can see clearly both spots where meteors hit the moon , the powershot only captured one    this camera is awesome  .
i would not be able to obtain the macro shots that i've gotten with the nikon if using my rebel without buying addt'l and costly lenses  .
when my husband gave me the nikon coolpix p100 for mothers day i thought he is crazy  .
now i praise him for it  .
it is worth every penny .
for $399  .
00 (or a little less) it offers flexibility in this compact package which if you had a separate body and the lenses needed to shoot the variety of shots offered by the p100 , you would need a lot more cash but a huge bag to carry it all  .
picture quality of course is not like the big boys but i am not at all disappointed after fine tuning the menu  .
great product with 1080p movie    making ability .
overall it's an excellent product  .

if you are interested in pictures quality , maybe you should think it again , but if not , go ahead .
good deal price/quality  .
i must start by saying that i do not know how to take good photos and the p 100 seemed a good way to learn before i took the plunge to an expensive slr  .
unfortunately i have tried and tried but cannot take consistent good quality photos  .
the automatic setting is to say the least pitiful and photos taken with the scene menu are very poor indeed  .
i have taken the same photo with the p 100 and my 7 years old fujifiml f 700 and i have to say that despite the same settings the old camera is far superior to the p 100  .
having spend more that 500 aus$ in china (i have to live here for a few years) i feel that the name nikon has lost some of his shine with this product  .
after having read many glowing reviews i start to think that maybe is my inexperience and will try to learn more about photography .
i can  .
t be happy with this sound problem so this camera model is not mine  .
finally , i returend two of this camera model .
i bought this camera  .
i used it for several trip in the period of 2 months only  .
found that it's totally unsatisfied  .
due to the size , storage and portability , also the performance , i've decided to buy a dslr  .
then bought cxxxx rxxxx x2x  .
it is much defferent feelings  .
at the moment , i am still very happy with it .
because of the 26x zoom , i wanted to use it to replace my panasonic fz28 fz35 which i use primarily for video due to you cannot find over 18x zoom on an hd video camera  .
also the overall length of video camera make it hard to zoom on fast moving objects , you get a fish tail effect  .
after trying the camera i found that the photo quality was not good  .
it also has an electronic view finder which works well on my panasonic , however with the p100 when you hit the video record button the image in the viewfinder goes black for at least 2 seconds  .
when you are trying to video fast moving objects once the picture comes back on in the viewfinder that object has moved and you can no longer see it in the viewfinder  .
this does not happen with the panasonic camera which only has a 18x zoom and 720p video , but the photo quality is better .
im still playing with this camera , but for the price i paid i didnt expect to have problems with it within the very short time i had it  .
i had it only a few hours and had it lock up on me 3x needless to say im not happy  .
i will be taking it back , but first i need to try it out at the local ice hockey rink to see the quality that i can get since that is the reason im moving up to a bigger camera campared to my little kodak  .
if it does what i want it to do there then i will just exchange and try it out again and if not its going back for good .
i have returned the camera  .
very unreliable  .
the zoom although large should not become fixed when used  .
the zoom locked 4 time when i used the camera on the first day  .
this is in taking about 160 pictures  .
i also did not like how soft the pictures were when i reviewed them later  .
i had high hopes when i bought the camera because it had many features that i wanted  .
i also did not like the fact that you had to charge the battery unless you bought a seperate charger that did not come with the camera  .
the battery took about 3 hrs to charge  .
the flap that you lift to charge the camera is very flimsy and i am sure will not hold up and it will seperate from the camera body  .
returned the camera after 3 days .
i have a suspicion that someone got the decimal place on the megapixel rating wrong  .
the images resemble my dirst digital with 1  .
3 megapixels and awful pink fringing on the skintones  .
color temp is way off , especially with flash  .
images lack detail as a result  .
surely the delay between pressing the shutter button and the actual exposure does not have to be so long  .
maybe nikon has found a way to recycle the guts of very old cameras or has found a stash of old ccds that they want to get rid of  .
my kodak 6490 is looking pretty good right now  .
too bad i cannot return this thing  .
i did not realize that the name nikon no longer means anything close to quality and integrity  .
for pity sakes , get the 10  .
3 megapixels off the camera and advertising  .
a nikon is supposed to be able to take very good pictures  .
bottom line   a camera should first and foremost be engineered to record acceptable images  .
in spite of all the cool features this camera is supposed to possess , picture    taking is not one of its attributes  .
ps i have been using nikons since 1973 and presently own two d200's  .
compared to my wife's kodak 6490 , the nikon coolpix p100 is an overpriced piece of junk  .
sorry , but i cannot get over what a sham this camers is .
i tried this camera twice  .
first one froze in full zoom and i had to remove and re put in the battery and then it slowly shut down  .
sometimes the buttons would not respond  .
so i returned it and tried another on  .
that one would sometimes not zoom at all , or would take off and zoom all the way out and the bar would indicate it is even in digital zoom as well  .
the on off button would not respond worth a darn  .
those pics , when i could get it to work , looked slightly orange  .
no i is not willing to 'play' with the settings  .
at that point i had had the camera less than one day  .
what the %#^ is up with nikon and the p series  .
i am extremely dissapointed and done with that line possibly nikon , for quite awhile .
there is no good words to say for this coolpix p100 camera  .
taking video is of no use as too much back ground noise  .
i spent too much money on this camera but in reply got a big 0  .
