sure , the place has been around for many years but i think it 's had a total refurbishment a few years ago and is now as classy as it gets inside , in the `` modern 5-star international grand hotel '' style .
i think - not sure - the original bath tub has been replaced by a bath-tub-size walk-in shower , which was high-powered and clean .
it 's a big hotel - 500 rooms or so - so while all the staff were polite , helpful and efficient enough - you 're unlikely to get , and it 's unreasonable to expect , anything in the way of personalised service , at least if you 're staying in the standard rooms .
the food was exactly as one would expect in a hotel like this - wide international range , good quality , but nothing outstanding .
the ( outdoor ) pool area was clean , still quite busy at even 6pm , but looking a bit tired - no glass-n-steel , or sweeping infinity pool effects here !
good that the hotel bothered to do his to minimise guests ' wait , as there was still at times a queue of maybe ten guests waiting to get a table .
and it 's surrounded by other high-rise tower blocks , so i doubt it offers too much in the way of direct sunlight for tanning .
over the past five+ years i usually stay at the hilton or le meriden hotels at kl sentral on my frequent visits to the city , as i imagine the shangri-la , though more centrally located , to be boring and old-fashioned .
the buffet breakfast was a bit chaotic , and revealed just how big and busy the hotel is .
despite small tables , packed closely together , the large and noisey lemon tree restaurant was filled to capacity both weekend mornings , with spill-over onto tables set up in the lobby , in the main lounge area , and by the outside gardens .
