owners giorgina and masimo were great- from organising my transfer , talking me through the best places to eat and streets to visit - you must do the museum of photography , to kindly going to pick up a bus ticket , booking a cooking course with souk cuisine - immense fun , and inviting me to join them for dinner .

i really noticed in my two weeks in morroco how naturally curteous morroccans are to guests and how they genuinely want to ensure you have a good time - none more so than the staff here -el makky and mohammet just two whose name i remember .
from the moment i booked via email and giorgina responded answering all my questions i knew i 'd made a great choice .
