this is my second samsung tv  .
my first and the one i replaced with this one is a big pnb58560 a nice tv with a nice picture but this 8500 blows it away so i dont miss the extra 3  .
in response to a previous post , the bezel on that tv did start internally cracking  .
i suspect it is the huge amount of heat that plasma thru off (very hot)  .
the samsung customer service is excellent new bezel ordered and is replaced by a tech  .
with in 10 days  .
samsung has acknowledged the problem , but are in no way looking to correct it  .
i hope it does not occur on my 8500 bezel , but as led's run cooler it should not be a problem  .
as i mentioned previously the picture on this tv can render some hd material look to real  .
the speakers are terrible , but except for my sony klv    40zx1m and previous pioneer pdp    50    60hd no flat panel does  .
i sold my samsung plasma and is waiting on a new sony nx800 or new 7000 samsung 3d when i stumbled into abc warehouse in canton , mi and is stunned to find this tv for sale for $1880  .
00 dollars yep bought it on the spot  .
and glad i did this is by far the best tv i have ever seen or owned  .
i what a great deal  .
if you can find one buy it , who wants to watch tv with glasses anyways  .
(3d) great customer service  .
best picture , great for bright room and better picture with deeper blacks then my pioneer plasma ( sorry pioneer kuro worshipers) .
the picture just blew us away right out of the box especially for us coming from 9 yr old sony lcd  .
we thought the tv is easy to set up right out of the box  .
in less than 2 hours we had it hooked up through the receiver , had the blu ray player , and wii all ready to go  .
the menu is very easy to use and the basic setting are easy to scroll through and change  .
now that we have had it for a week i would like to get into really setting the tv up but this where we/i will need some help  .
the only minor thing i can think of is w/ the wii and the pq not being so great but i am sure there is a game mode somewhere to help that out  .
if you go direct to the tv the wii pq is fine but then no surround sound but if i go through the receiver the pq becomes fuzzy  .
other than that i cannot imagine finding a better tv out there right now unless you are just made of money and a complete av expert i will post back after we have had it for a while to see how it does over w/ more use and better calibration  .
bottom line i researched these hdtv's for months and finally decided on the samsung b8500 led  .
i decided that it is worth the extra money , and the 55 inch screen is the best choice  .
i hooked it up the day before the superbowl and watched my first football game in super hd  .
what a treat for a big football fan , who has visited new orleans many times  .
next to my car , this is the best purchase choice i have ever made .
you will not be dissatisfied with this product  .
this is on the top of my list after reading cnet and other reviews  .
without telling my wife the model number but telling her the price range with this tv at the high end she said that there is no way we could spend more than half what this model cost  .
we went to best    buy and window shopped  .
she kept coming back to this model and is totally bedazzled by how much better the picture is on this unit even when i set the video mode to standard from the show room dynamic setting  .
we concluded that , despite this model being very pricey , that we would bite    the    bullet and go with what is clearly the best picture quality after two month we had a gray horizontal band appear on the screen  .
it took samsung less than two weeks to have a replacement screen shipped and installed under warranty at my house by their local technician .
the picture on this television is as amazing as advertised , and it's by far the clearest picture that i've personally ever seen  .
the blacks are deep , the colors are true and vibrant , and the images are crisp and nearly 3d    esque before i bought this television , i'd read reviews that the picture has poor off    angle viewing  .
perhaps my eyes aren't as keen as the experts' , but i totally disagree with that  .
i've had the television for two weeks , and i've watched the television at several different angles  .
i've specifically looked for a dropoff in quality at off angles , and i have not noticed any material difference  .
so , i'm not sure what they're talking about my only gripe about this television (if you could really call it that) is that the speakers are pretty average  .
and , when you're looking at a totally amazing picture with mediocre sound , the mediocre sound stands out and is pretty distracting  .
so , we paid another $600 for an external speaker system (bose cinemate series ii) to complement the tv       and at that point , the total cost is pretty nauseating .
find , buy it  .
we like the slim line and the fact that it can be mounted onto the wall with the flat brackets the quality and sound is fantastic .
out of the other three tvs i've owned , (the others being an aquos and kuros) i like this one the best  .
i use a kuros in the bedroom , but actually prefer the bright color pop of the b8500 , sometimes (especially during the day) the kuros just looks dull  .
i'm also an avid gamer and this tv comes with a game mode (which really doesn't need to be tweaked too much) and really brings out the artistry in the games  .
pair with blurays , widgets , amazing features , easy to use menus , this is one hell of a tv  .
as a videophile i highly recommend it  .
if you are picky about your set and do not know too much about how to set it right , just look for an isf calibrator in your area  .
this is an expensive tv and should be viewed at its highest potential to get the most of out it .
very happy with it , stunning picture quality , most beautiful tv image i've ever seen anywhere  .
i think the local dimming led is a significant advance in tv quality .
much better than my sony xbr9  .
picture details impressive with the best blacks i have seen  .
this is my first samsung    no more sony  .
i will have to follow    up with update as i experience this tv more .
i've had this tv for 6 weeks now and owned an older samsung 61in dlp  .
yes , this picture blows the dlp away  .
i haven't had any problems with it so far  .
no blooming , patches , capacitor problems    nada  .
i is surprised on the pic out of the box  .
followed internet advised settings and not bad at all  .
going to have it isf calibrated  .
did it to my dlp and never had to adjust anything on any input ever  .
well worth the money no matter what anyone says  .
just do it  .
other reviewers talk about the soap opera type pic and to be honest , it's kind of cool  .
not quite 3d but so lifelike  .
the only problem is it's sporatic  .
one or two scenes will have it and then the next ones won't  .
kind of wish it is either/or all the time so i could get used to one or the other  .
blu ray pics are unreal  .
my son    in    law bought the first year led edge lit samsung 40in for $5k and just saw mine  .
he is pissed  .
i is happy  .
0) looking on line now , you cannot get these for less than $5500  .
got mine at bb for $3k  .
i still go to bb and magnolia to compare and to my eye , even the new tv's don't have the same quality  .
anyway , i'm way happy with this tv  .
just hope i do not have any of the negative experiences with it others have had  .
so far so good .
i could go on for 5000 words but i don't have too  .
from the time you turn it on and adjust the settings you will say omg  .
it is a joy to use very simple and straight foward in the menu's and settings  .
you should have at least 5  .
1 pushing 1800 watts to really pull this into it's realm  .
the one thing that might give some trouble is actually finding one , they seem to be scarce i had to travel 150 miles one way to find the one i have , but after i got it running it is well worth the trip  .
go for it , do not hesitate do it you'll not regret it .
one of the best sets that i have dealt with  .
albeit expensive , it is well worth the investment if you are an image quality nut and afraid of the joys of plasma please take the time to calibrate the set to get the most out of it  .
either pay a pro for best results , or use a set up disc  .
this set looks great on and off .
i'm sure it's a quality high end hdtv but the cost is prohibitive  .
vizio makes a 55 inch led baclight machine for less than  .
half the price of the un55b8500 .
this is the nicest lcd tv i have ever seen  .
i recently purchased this tv and have been very impressed with it  .
the blacks are incredible and the colors are lifelike  .
the think design is impressive but the picture quality is what really takes the cake  .
one warning  .
this tv is very reflective  .
if you have windows that face your tv you need to make sure you can block out any light coming in or you will see reflections that can be distracting  .
overall though a real winner and the best lcd to date updated  .

easy to set up .
we have had this tv for more than 2 weeks now  .
soon after we hooked up the tv , we noticed 2 medium sized shadow patches on the screen  .
so , we called samsung support and they arranged for an in    home visit by a local service company  .
i is very impressed by how quickly my call is answered (i believe by an american representative) ; virtually no wait time  .
the local service technician came over within 2 days and ordered some parts that needed to be replaced  .
the part replacement is scheduled within the next 5 days  .
actually the whole panel needed to be repplaced  .
after panel replacement , the tv just works great  .
this is our first hdtv , and we are extremely pleased with the vivid picture quality  .
the blacks are just superb and colors are very accurate  .
there are a myriad of picture settings to choose from  .
so , feel free to play around with the settings to suit your eyes  .
definitely hook this tv up with a home theater sound system to truly enjoy it  .
other than the picture quality , the tv is extremely thin and looks sleek when put on the wall (of course with a slim wall mount)  .
the only feature i wish for is built    in wireless connectivity  .
i would have given the tv 5 stars , but for the panel that needed to be replaced  .
i do feel that manufacturing defects can occur randomly , and i is unfortunate enough to be a recipient of one  .
i do give credit to samsung to seamlessly arrange for the repairs  .
do not buy samsung tvs until they quit using cheap components (the cheap capacitors)  .
and properly re    vamp their customer support so many people have had capacitor problems that there are instructions on how to replace the capacitors on youtube  .
(no joke  .
all i know is i got a bad product and want it fixed , no more run aroubnds  .
will update when i get another response from samsung  .
no sounds , can not turn off power  .
before you buy any samsung tv do an internet search for samsung tv power supply problems  .
you'll find many complaints about a capacitor issue  .
if nothing else , buy an extended warranty .
samsung has horrible customer service  .
if you have an issue they give you an address to send your complaint  .
this is a great tv , period  .
check out the reviews and take note that of lcd tv's , it's picture quality is often rated the best  .
the fact that it died after 4 months is absolutely unacceptable  .
it's an industry wide known fact that bad batches of capacitors out there exist , are causing products to have shorter than reasonable lifespans  .
more expensive working capacitors can be bought to resolve the problem but companies are too cheap to make the switch and instead just let the consumer take the pain  .
the effect is that consumers do not want to spend money on anything because quality is low , and purchasing something new just means buying problems and agony wake up electronics industry  .
do the right thing  .
locate and destroy these capacitors assuming my broken tv is repaired with new , good quality capacitors , at no expense to me , i still will have missed seeing the olympics on my new tv  .
how does samsung make that up to me  .
taking a deep breath and putting the obvious frustration aside , this tv is great  .
i'm picky , and i have no complaints  .
samsung's back lit led/lcd tvs have always been a site to see for picture quality  .
the have been a brave company , innovating and advancing the entire hdtv industry  .
they give the consumer what they want in terms of performance and features  .
the only feature i would add is a built in 6500k thx callibrated mode that is done at the factory i would buy another samsung in the future if i had proof the capacitor issue is solved  .
i would advise potential buyers of any high end electronic product to consider extended warranties until this industry wide capacitor problem has played out updated  .

just be an informed consumer  .

cheap , is only a led backlight and a lcd display not a true led , quality of sound is horrible with no mid or low whatsoever , would never buy it  .
im waiting for sony real led .
buyer beware of samsung all samsung t  .
v's are plagued by cracking bezel defects , cracked screens and dead pixels  .
if you have any problems with your television even if it is under warranty samsung will not fix it  .
they will send a repair guy out to your house within a couple days of your warranty claim than they will be mia  .
they wo not return your calls or even give you an update on the status of your warranty  .
in my case i have been waiting for 2 months and no one wants to tell me anything  .
if you need more proof check out the better business bureau or the ontario ministry of consumer services samsung is on the buyer beware data base updated  .

it works for short time then shuts off - maybe i should start reading instead; everything - it doesn't work
True / vibrant colors, deep blacks, crisp images that really "pop"; Mediocre sound for a $4000+ television
Picture is the best I have seen. Bestbuy delivery is perfect. Internet connection vey easy to setup.; Nothing so far.
Nothing, Samsung knows it is selling a defective product yet wont recall it.; Samsungs customer service and issue resolveing are a joke
Beautiful coloration, perfect uniformity, BRIGHT, independent day and night control, deep black levels, customizable Judder/Blur Reduction, LED back-lighting without bright spots, reflective screen creates richer images (previous Aquos was matte),; Really needs calibration out of the box.
Wonderful picture, incredible colors. I would have given 5 stars if Samsung had used good capacitors, and had proper customer support; 1. Terrible customer support!. 2. Cheap components............. 3. .EXTREMELY expensive to fix. 4. CHEAP CAPACITORS................thousands of Samsung TV owners angry about this problem!
PQ is amazing in light or dark room to us. Very thin, and great looking even when off.; Calibration can be a bit intimidating if you are new to highend HDTVs which we are
Blacks rivaling top end Plasma. Bright enough to use in a room with a 4x6 foot skylight and three panel south facing French doors. Picture detail and color saturation are off the scale.; Costly, pedestrian on-board speakers
Impressive black levels, Fairly accurate color reproduction if you take the time to calibrate, Network ready, Fairly smooth motion display. Great sleek design! It also has a decent amount of options to tweak the sound to your liking.; Color saturation begins to fade outside of 45 degrees from 10 feet back. Internet widgets are painfully slow to load. Very expensive compared to some of the other high end competition.
I wear glasses and it is so clear I love it; Longer warranty. Should have waited though for the borderless one.
Crisp, picture. Colors are perfect. The quality of the picture is so good, you actually become part of the scene, you feel like you're there. Sound is awesome as well.; Need plenty of room for the 55" screen. The size can be overwhelming at times. Cost was too high, could get the 46" for $1000 less...
Great pic out of the box. Blows plasma away. Sound okay for regular TV listening. No problems with blooming, patches or capacitors. Just great picture, sometimes too real.; Reflection during daytime. Can ignore after a while unless you think about it then it drives you crazy. Does have "soap opera" pic on some venues. Some like it some don't. Pic washes out on side viewing.
best picture on high def.; according to the user manual burn in is bad.quote(displaying stationary images on screen can cause uneven aging fo led display or burn in. Stationary images should be limited to 5% of the total viewing per week.) Poor pixture on non HD. I have cable.
Deep blacks, extremely vivid colors, bright whites. Reflective screen hasnt bothered me, image is richer than matte screen. Originally wanted a plasma but found the LED puts out more light for a more vivid image, with arresting color and inky blacks.; Cost is high, but this will change with time. LCDs have had more trouble handling motion than plasmas, which bothered me on the A950, but with the separate dejudder and antiblur controls on this tv basically solve the problem
Wow 55" thin; picture quality is bad next to any sony lcd, white looks light blue and background of picture has horrible detail, panel creates a lot of glare and colors are so bright that makes it look fake. 120hz-240hz create ghosting samsung is just not there yt
Largely regarded as the best LED/LCD picture on the market, low power usage, DLNA built into TV. Firmware updates via Internet.; Purchased TV on 10/09, it's now 2/10 and it won't start and has the dreaded repeated clicking noise that is usually indicative of bad Capacitors in the power supply. The capacitor probelm has been a known, recurring, Samsung problem.
I like the fact that it's LED backlit with 240hz and produces great color and deep blacks. If you had an led behind every. pixel, guess what you'd have.? You'd have a Plasma TV.; In Canada it would cost around 6200.00 dollars or so with taxes. My Panasonic TC-P54V10 is just as good or better. and costs about 40% less than the UN55B8500
Loved the fantastic picture quality , great size for the room and wonderful definition.; Worked fine for 6 weeks then lost 1/3 of the screen, lower right. Now it is a dark square. The pixels are bad. The company who sold it will not take it back. Told to call Samsung, they have a problem with the warranty.
Design is very nice not quite as thin as the 8000 or new 7000 but those are edge-lit and suffer from flash lighting. Swivel stand (brushed aluminum) looks great! On screen programing and endless picture adjustments work great. Amazing picture!; TV input locations are atrocious, center bottom would have been a way better choice. The picture can be so good and clear in HD that movies look "FAKE" like the actors look as if they are on a set. This is disturbing and is a little heavy. Widgets!
Deepest blacks, whitest whites and colors make you think that you're in the picture. Ease of operation you may not even need to manual. Even the sound is not all that bad. When you crank up the 6.1 you will know what I mean. No bloom at all. No blurr; Most of the bad points in all of the reviews on at least 4 web sites is the sound of the speakers that come with this TV. Look they are not that bad for generic TV speakers. Great for listing to the news.
