Sufficiently sensitive touch screen
> Better screen touch sensitivity
The home screen shows four options :
Screen is clear and maps are pretty easy to follow .
3 inches screen and steady performance .
Also, push every icon on every screen you see .
3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .
Screen size is good and I didn't want one that had blue tooth and a lot of 'extras' I wouldn't use .
> More responsive that my old 760  , plus a better looking screen
> Same screen size as the other 4 .
