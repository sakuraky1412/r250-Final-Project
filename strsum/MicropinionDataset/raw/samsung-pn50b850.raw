Pros:. ...EVERYTHING!? Picture!!! Styling, just about everything. The price is a major plus! At the time of this review Sears has this TV for $1399!. 
Cons:. Poor sound, but most TV's nowadays need a sound bar or HTIB anyway.. 
Summary:. The best TV i have ever seen. The sytling is incredible, not much on glare, and just overall phenominal picture quality. Since all Samsung ultra-thin displays have terrible speakers I didn't expect much and was impressed or dissapointed with the sound. It was...meh. Same as the LED's...But for nearly half the price.. I respected CNet a lot but they have lost considerable respect in my eyes since labeling LED's having the best picture ever. Standing in front of LED's playing HDTV and blu-rays for the better part of 8hrs I have to say, as well as the general customer opinion, the Plasma's can't be beat.. I have had many a customer come in looking specifically for the LED's, previously the UN55B8000/7000 and having the be surprised by how much better a picture the B850 has. Yes the LED's are great and make me more money but majority of people prefer the Plasma's. And don't think, "Oh it's the price!". I work near Blackhawk, CA an incredibly rich area and it's not uncommon for a resident to come in and drop a few grand on a handful of TV's right after buying all new appliances for their home. People just seem to outright prefer the performance and look of the plasmas, specifically the B850. I'm contemplating purchasing the B850 or waiting to buy the 2010 PN50C8000 with a new three processor setup and the tru black cone as well as it being 3D capable and supposedly retailing for the same price as the B850's normal price, $2099.. I'm not trying to discourage people for buying an LED because it's all about what you think looks best since it is your money right? But whatever your heart desires, but believe me when I say the B850 has a phenomenal picture. Watch the IMAX sequence of The Dark Knight when the police are transporting Harvey Dent under the roadway and are attacked by the Joker in an 18 wheeler. Just incredible.. The buzzing issue has been solved as of August 2009 FYI. All B850's manufactured after August 2009 do not have the buzzing issue.. Updated. on Apr 11, 2010.

Pros:. GREAT life like picture. Easy set up. Black and whites are very good and NO BUZZING, Compared to the Panny G-10 and i thing Panny pictire looks fake. Samsung850 looks life like and i love hat it is so thin. looks like a $3000 t.v. 
Cons:. P.I.P not user friendly. needs its own input signal and no button on remote for P.I.P. 
Summary:. Great t.v . Spent months trying to decide between Samsung 850 and the Panny G-10. So glad i went with the Samsung. Sears had it on sale for $1489 but did not have any instock. Went to Best buy and they do not advertise that they had the 850 ( they push the 860) i saw the 850 for $1899. I told them about Sears having the same t.v for $1489. So the did a price match even after they found out that Not one Sears store in San Diego had the t.v in stock. Setting up t.v was a breese. and when i turned it on, no buzz ( THANK GOD!!!!) Picture looks great and looking at the picture is like being right there with them, real life like, Sound it good but i did buy a Samsung sound bar to get a little deeper base.But sound is fine without the soundbar. If u are thinking of buying another t.v, think real hard because u cant go wrong with this t.v. can't wait for Charger season to start, i even cacelled my charger season tickets so i can buy the NFL ticket from direct t.v and stay home and watch my Chargers kick butt on this GREAT t.v. Hope this review helps u in knowing that u cant go wrong by buying this t.v..............GO BOLTS!!!!!!!.

Pros:. Best features, picture quality, bright enough for the day, no need for these stupid automotion 240 hz crap, 600 hz keeps it in focus. 
Cons:. little slow when loading the yahoo widgets, but i'm telling you ur gonna be playing with ur remote more than watch tv.. 
Summary:. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Cutting edge everything. Best TV EVER!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture. Style. 
Cons:. Non. My set has no buzz sound the tech at the store said this is a issue that has been fixed. 

$$;
Pros:. i love the picture on this plasma TV.. 
Cons:. awkward to reach input jacks on the back. 
Summary:. it's so beautiful, dynamic, vibrant and colorful- totallly natural- not overblown or artificial. it's like watching a film in a theatre (with HD input that is). it looks elegant too. love the internet connectivity with streaming video from netflix, amazon ,etc. with an internet blu-ray player. have noticed no buzz whatsoever. sound is decent- i'm hesitating to hook up a stereo to it since it does pretty well on its own. i'm sure audio could be improved but i haven't been motivated to go through the hassle. it does have a mixer-style level adjustment in the menu to tailor the sound, so of course i boosted the bass response.. this bears no resemblance to what i remember as "TV", even though i came off a CRT HDTV (albeit without a blu ray). i watched 3 movies in a row yesterday, all streamed. not sure if that's a good thing!. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful TV - both the picture and the unit itself. I would recommend this to anyone.. 
Cons:. The built in speakers are weak, but I'm not concerned since we will be using an external audio setup for movies and other demanding sources.. 
Summary:. My wife and I went to the store with almost preconceived ideas about what kind of TV we wanted to bring home. We wanted to see them side by side and decide for ourselves which one looked the best to us. After much deliberation in the store, we narrowed the field to two and ultimately selected the Samsung over the other model. They didn't have any in stock, so we had to wait a few days for the next shipment to arrive. We were initially very happy with our selection.. When we got home, we started reading the user reviews of the TV that we had committed to and panic began to set in. A bunch of user reviews claimied that there was a distracting buzz that plagues this model. Some even suggested that the design was defective.. It is sad that others have had this experience, but I'm pleased to report that there is no audible buzz coming from our Samsung PN50B-850. Some of the reviews stated that the buzz began after a month or so of use, but ours has been quiet for at least that long. I'm an experienced audio technician who has worked in live and studio sound environments and a buzz like the one described would probably send me over the edge. Fortunately our TV is stone quiet - even when there is a bright picture being displayed.. 

$$;
Pros:. GREAT PICTURE easy set up,orverall very happy with it. NO BUZZING at all.. 
Cons:. speakers are fair at best.once in awhile image ret.Some reflections,as with most plasmas.. 
Summary:. NO BUZZING at all. Wanted a panasonic but the lihgt shade of green yellow turns me off.Have had for 30 day now went with c-net settings and am ver pleased with it. I am one not onboard with the LCD craze.. Updated. on Sep 25, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Stylish design, great menu system, amazing depths of colors and black levels.. 
Cons:. Like most plasmas, this model tends to run hot, but can be remedied by running in Standard viewing mode.. 
Summary:. For those buffoons that note the Buzz and Hot issue, you are wrong. The buzz and heat are only amplified when running in DYNAMIC viewing mode. Who watches in that mode? It's for the Best Buy showroom. Geesh ..... Amazing Plasma TV, great price despite what Cnet thinks ... compared to similar LED models from Samsung.. Go for it!. 

$$;
Pros:. - Good Blacks. - Unique Styling. - burn-in prevention scan (white wash, pixel shifting). - BANG FOR BUCK!. 
Cons:. - awkward to assemble. - still not feeling plasma technology.. 
Summary:. I'm an electronics sales associate and I truly love this TV. I'm eagerly waiting for Cnet's review because I give this TV a 9.2!. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing picture quality, jaw-dropping design, good feature set, great picture control options, nice remote, intuitive menu. 
Cons:. Pricy, slight buzz. 
Summary:. Wow. That's what I say every time I turn this thing on, or just look at it as I walk by. It's also what my friends say when they have a look too... The picture quality is stunning. I had mine callibrated and it blows anything I've ever seen right out of the water. (Except for the $5,000 Pioneer plasmas) As CNET states, the picture quality is superb. I know that people always talk about how good LCDs are getting, and how great the new LEDs are, but I just love the colors you get with plasmas! I think they look the best out of the three categories, and this tv especially.. I use this set mainly for movies, and it looks spectacular. I use mostly in very low lit conditions, but I imagine that it would perform great even in brighter lit rooms too.. One thing I have fallen in love with is how easy it is to customize your picture and how many options you have for adjusting it perfect to your likings. I also use it for infrequent gaming, and it's very nice to be able to have the picture control settings completely independant of eachother.. The menus are really great and easy to use. I am never stuck searching around for something that I found once, and now can't remember how to get back to it. The remote control is also nice, although, I never use it because of the use of a Harmony universal.. Now to the buzz. If i just turn on the tv with no sound and it is quiet in the room, I can faintly hear the buzz that everyone is talking so much about. But as soon as i start watching anything with sound, no matter how low the volume, I can't hear the buzz anymore. Maybe that's just from me going deaf though blasting my Klipsch HT too much :) Either way, the buzz doesn't bother me a bit, because I can't hear it.. The only real drawback on this set I would say is the price. As CNET says, it has the same great picture quality of the other series, which do cost a pretty penny less. Obviously with this set, you are paying for the incredible design, which in my book was totally worth it. And if you want a tv to wall mount, this is it.. Overall I would say it was an excellent purchase and I haven't regretted it once.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture is fantastic! Ask any tv expert/cnet. Theyll say that plasma beats lcd/led in picture quality hands down.. Price is also great. I was able to get BestBuy to $1399. A led tv thats 1.2" thin &#38; 50" &#38; of this quality would set you back $21. 
Cons:. The buzz that some complains about isnt a issue now. my neighbor got one 2 months back that buzzed but samsung replaced it for free. the new batch is buzz free!. only thing is that the widgets (internet) are slow but getting faster with every update. 
Summary:. this tv has one issue and one issue only. slow widgets. dont let that one small issue change your mind about this tv because your not gonna be using that as much as you may think. the picture quality is worth $2500+ and you can get it for $1500. if your looking for a good tv to watch your sports and blu rays on with a picture that will suck you in and are willing to spend the money than get this tv!. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen thickness 1.2". Excellent picture quality. 1080p/24. 4 HDMI ports. Pixel response 0.001 = no pixelating for sports/fast action movies. Digital (optical) audio output for speaker connection. Network and multi-media internet access.. 
Cons:. Don't anticipate any issues however, would like to see 2 year warranty in lieu of standard 1 year. Built in speakers at 15W are ok, thus a .5 star deduction. No buzzing noted as noted with other reviews.. 
Summary:. Outstanding plasma screen at only 1.2 inches. Plug-in ports very nice to access with swivel base. Menu settings allow for setup of multiple hues, tones, and colors. Ability to increase or decrease blacks. Truly an excellent picture. This is an excellent system. Blacks are near that of the newer LED's (although those are not true LED sets). Sleek style make this an outstanding buy ($1,580 on 10/5/09). Samsung should include a Home Theater Soundbar speaker system and that would bring this to a five star rating.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture quality is much better than my Sony Bravia and rivals my Panasonic Viera... First Samsung I have ever owned. Sound is amazing and the slim design adds the perfect touch to the new house. We'll see how the reliability is over itme.. 
Cons:. Putting the TV on a the base stand was VERY hard. + I was surprised to see it was MADE OF PLASTIC! Being a 50 inch, this is a heavy TV that is held by a heavy metal base but the part that attaches the TV to the base is actually made of plastic.. 
Summary:. This is an amazing TV that i would recommend to anyone. Great Buy. (Aside from the plastic piece that attaches the TV to the base - see "cons"). I still love Panasonic... but this really raises the bar. I have no buzzing issues, maybe its because my TV was manufactured in January 2010? Not sure. Whatever the case may be, great TV, great sound and display... NO BUZZING!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture is great for sports and movies. In standard mode it doesn't run hot at all. Lots of inputs and speakers sound good. Enough adjustments for the picture and easy to use. I like the swivel and the styling of the TV.. 
Cons:. I bought mine Jan. 14, 2010 and it buzzes moderately. I can notice it at low volume from 10 feet away. It is worse in the middle of the screen where I like to sit of course. It doesn't bother my wife but she doesn't watch as much TV and I'm pickier.. 
Summary:. I called Samsung and the call center person said to return it or a tech would come to check it out. I love the TV but would really like the buzz gone. Trying to decide on trying another one, let the Tech. try, or go to a Panasonic.. Updated. on Feb 3, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, colour, motion all OUTSTANDING. Slim panel looks great. 4 HDMI inputs. 
Cons:. It buzzes...loudly. Remote is useless except to adjust picture settings, buy a harmony. Few rca inputs. 
Summary:. I own this TV. It buzzes..more than a plasma should. Late at night when the kids are in bed and the volume is down you can REALLY hear it. Annoyingly so. During the day with all of the ambient noise it is not that noticeable but I know it's still there. The lighter the scene the louder the buzz (ie: watching a hockey game? The buzz is REALLY loud) and commercials/anything with graphics on-screen seem to set it off. A Samsung Tech is coming in to fix this. If you read online threads the problem has been fixed since late summer but I bought mine prior to this.. For that negative I must say that I don't think I've seen such a clear, perfect picture. Colours are vibrant and perfect, the menu is easy to navigate and seems endless on picture adjustments. Watching hockey/sports on this is flawless, no motion blur compared to LCD. SD and HD is outstanding.. Not many inputs other than the 4 HDMI. My Wii uses up all 5 rca inputs but with the panel being SO thin you have to sacrifice something.. I do not regret buying this TV, just pray that the Tech can fix the buzzing so I can really enjoy the experience that much more.... 

$$;
Pros:. The TV has incredible color display and black levels. The colors really jump out at you. The thin design makes it feel like a painting on the wall. The ease of setup for the internet features was cool, but the widgets aren't so great.. 
Cons:. The TV does not have the Cinema smooth that the CNET review said it does. When watching 1080p/24p sources the refresh rate is always 24hz, never 96hz like the review says. It makes blu ray movies look like home movies as opposed to actual films.. 

$$;
Pros:. Thin, light 53 lbs easy to hang on a mount, dark blacks, low energy consumption.. 
Cons:. Price, Price, Price!. 
Summary:. Great set and on par with my 42" Panny.. Buzzing? The reveiwers that hear buzzing need to back off their alcohol intake as it's probably more mental then actual. Nothing of the sort in my set.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality.. 
Cons:. Widgets are slow and won't connect, the software to share videos, pictures and musice is so badly designed it won't handle sharing all of these folders at the same time, BAD tech support can not help as they don't have the knowledge.. 
Summary:. If you want a great picture this is the TV for you but don't expect the extra features to work!. 

$$;
Pros:. Super Thin, Nice stylish Bezel, Good accurate color, oh did a say thin!. 
Cons:. Blacks are not up to par with cheaper Pana's and Samsung's (ie G10, B650, V10). At a $2000 price point you could buy a better TV with a better picture with more features &#38; Inputs. Oh and the buzzing everyone's talking about would worry me.. 
Summary:. If you want stylish design over picture quality what was wrong with an LED. You can easily get a better picture and save $800 buying a G10 or a B650. I look forward to Samsung making thinner and thinner Plasma Panels but not at the sacrifice of picture quality, overall functionality and cost effectiveness!. 

$$;
Pros:. The best picture I have seen on any HDTV. In my opinion even better then the aforementioned Panasonic.. 
Cons:. A progressively loud BUZZING! I returned and bought same TV twice from Best Buy. I confirmed it again w/ the model in the stores. Has plagued Samsung plasma TV's this year apparently. In Europe they have admitted it. You can read. 
Summary:. I loved this TV but unfortunately the loud BUZZING was very annoying. I won't trust CNET again for not mentioning this, because it is all over the internet too. Or go listen for yourself, it starts after a few hours of use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture. Nice Style. 
Cons:. Biggest Con is the heat. This puppy is HOT! Too hot for itself. The back panel on the one I use is already warping. I have only had it a couple of months. The back panel is also starting to discolor. It just seems like it will be a big problem.. 
Summary:. Nice looking picture and good style. But the heat issue worries me. I'd stay away from this years model and wait for them to address the issue in the 2010 release. If you are desperate for an ultrathin in 09 I'd go with the LN55B6000/8000. Colors look better to me and it'll run more efficiently with no heat.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stellar fit and finish. Front Bezel will last forever and looks spectacular. Functionality runs at about 95% suggesting that everything works together to provide a superb picture.. 
Cons:. - My set does emit a small amount of high frequency noise. Of course you can't hear it during moderate volume levels, but when the seen is quiet...it?s all the BUZZ.. 
Summary:. Purchased 8/31/09 - My only complaint is with the buzzing....other issues related to picture performance I can live with...Samsung should really have rectified this issue prior to production...If I cannot resolve the issue by 9/5/09 the set will be returned.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture clarity, color, very thin, easy network setup.. 
Cons:. The buzzing is unbearable.. 
Summary:. The buzzing is very real. It varies in severity based on the image and input. I wouldn't mind a constant buzz so much but it goes from relatively high pitched to low pitched. It can really ruin a quiet moment in a movie or show. I'm going to return this tv after having it for a week. This tv costs so much- basic quality should be a given.. 

$$;
Pros:. These plasmas are all show and no go. While the aesthetics, picture and feature set are excellent they are unermined by a loud and annoying buzzing sound emitted constantly even with the sounds turned off.. 
Cons:. These TVs buzz constantly! Totally unacceptable for a $2,000 TV. Check out the thread at avsforum. http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1144869. The Yahoo widgets are slow as molasses too!. 
Summary:. I can't believe David Katzmaier neglected to include the buzzing defect in his review. Escpecially since there are multiple threads about the buzz problem on CNET.com including the following:. http://forums.cnet.com/5208-13973_102-0.html?threadID=349119. http://forums.cnet.com/5208-13973_102-0.html?threadID=344409. Buyer beware!!!.
