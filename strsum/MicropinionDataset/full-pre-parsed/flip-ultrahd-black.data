this is a great camcorder for like video uploading  .

family events  .

but i wound't use it for sporting events , concerts  .

cause of the zoom  .

but over all it's not a bad camcorder .

buy it  .

this camera may be bigger than some , but for the hd , battery options , and more memory for 120 minutes of video storage , this camera is completely worth it  .

other than size , it fixes all the problems that the mino and past models had .

the flip ultra hd is a great product if your not reviewing tech products  .

like i said , if your reviewing a product with a screen it will appear blurry  .

there is also very limited storage  .

but still it is just a great product over all  .

ok , you won't be shooting a 3 hour feature film with this thing , but hey do some research into what you are buying  .

this is specifically designed to be used by non    tech heads who get overloaded turning on thier computer  .

if you don't try and ask this camera to do more than it is capable of you will be fine  .

i do not know how much video you think you need , but i have a new baby we have shot over 30 hours of video with ours and barely can fill the 2 hour capacity of the camera at one time  .

and that is including a trip to northern michigan  .

the usb connector is convienant but depending on your computer model the camera can be plugged at a wierd angle  .

software is ok , but if you like to make movies with edits and transitions i would suggest an aftermarked editing software such as sony vegas  .

this is a great ease of use camcorder  .

picture is good and it can betaken anywhere prices have dropped (got mine for $149) so it is a good value for the money and it is mac compatible  .

love it  .

when held still , records crisp video  .

even when moving , the pic quality is not bad  .

one not so great point       charge time is 7 hrs via usb to pc , or 3  .

5 hours using optional charger  .

i used for 2 hrs on and off without having to recharge and had spare batteries as back    up  .

easily recorded the highlights of an entire day's events and upload to pc is quick and easy  .

it's great improvement over non    hd  .

overall , i feel this is greatly worth the $199 i paid  .

you have to remember that this is a dinky little device with a tiny sensor in it , so the quality wo not be as good as a larger dedicated video camera , or one of the newer dslr's with the built in high    def  .

apples to oranges with a little extra cash and some super    glue , you can get more reach and wide angle out of the unit updated  .

on may 21 , 2009  .

for the cost and for out door shooting , you cant go wrong .

i have only had it 3 weeks  .

time will tell .

the flip ultrahd is a perfect hdv version of the point    and    click concept  .

you simply power up , and press the red button and you're shooting 720p video  .

it's that easy  .

it's as easy to use as any electronics device i've ever owned  .

even my luddite spouse can shoot decent video i own a canon hdv camcorder , but have shot only a few hours of video  .

with the camcorder , i find myself leaving it at home often because the batts are dead , i have no hdv cassettes , etc  .

in sharp contrast , i've owned my flip for only a week or so and have already shot nearly 6 hours of video the flip ultrahd is sturdy enough to be thrown in a beach bag or a glove box without much concern over damaging it  .

flip included a little pouch for the cam which is more than adequate for protecting it for short trips  .

again , this a huge improvement over the canon , where i need to bring its bag , batteries , tapes , etc , which has become such a pain with regards to video recording performance , the flip ultrahd has really blown me away  .

considering its price , i expected to see the usual noise riddled digital video , but instead is pleasantly surprised to see crisp , vibrant , smooth hd video shot both indoors and out  .

even indoor video looks great on the flip ultrahd , something i never expected from a flash    based camcorder  .

i also shot some night time footage which looked great too the included flipshare app is more than adequate for pulling the videos off the flip ultrahd  .

each recorded session is saved in a separate mp4 file , making it dead simple to pull videos off the flip  .

the app resides on the flip in both pc and mac executables , so you can use it on anything with a usb port i read quite a few negative reviews of the flip ultrahd which included some very questionable cons (doesn't include hdmi cable , no zoom lens , didn't like usb plug , etc) that make it appear as if some of those buyers simply ignored the specs that are clearly written on the side of the box  .

i searched google on my iphone while shopping in wal    mart and confirmed the specs in less than 2 minutes , i'm not sure how others were confused or disappointed because flip did not include an hdmi cable  .

not even blu    ray players include hdmi cables  .

besides , i'd much rather have a hdmi port w/o a cable than a proprietary port w/ cable for less than $200 , it's the same price as most digital still cameras , requires no media or expensive batteries and shoots very good 720p video within seconds of turning it on  .

if that's what you're looking for , the flip ultrahd fills that role in spades .

i needed a mini camcorder asap so i could record a event within the next hr  .

i ran into the local wallmart and bought the sony webbie hd model number   mhs    pm1/d for 140  .

00 which didnt come with any sd memory  .

then i bought and additional 4g sony sd card for another 40  .

fortunately event is delayed and gave me time to play with the sony i was not impressed with the sonys os nor the picture quality showing on the led screen , it is very grainy and the icons and words where hard to read  .

since this is a mini i figured all minis would be about the same quality  .

then i started to surf and look at some review which lead me to best buy to checkout the flip family  .

i is very impressed by the picture quality on the lcd  .

navigation as very simple easy  .

i do wish the zoom is a little more powerful , but what cam you expect form a mini  .

needless to say i bought the flip for 173  .

00 went to the event and recorded all 90min of the event without looking at the manual  .

got home plunged it into my pc and downloaded to my pc and emailed videos directly from the flip wizard installed on my pc , this is still without looking at the manual  .

the rest is history , i is impressed enough to tell my story and write a review  .

and the sony went back to wallmart before the day is done  .

you cant go wrong by buying a flip .

its easy to use , its fun , its spontaneous  .

anyone can use it the interface and software keeps it simple  .

though there are some easy improvements that could make the software better without adding complexity , this is a solid instant video capture device i use it to record drums , and even with its internal microphone the sound quality is actually very good  .

the hd 720p is even better  .

did i mention it can even make pictures from frames in the video  .

you can get rid of your camera and use this for both photography and not have to worry about capturing the 'right moment' just take the best frame from the recording and youll get yourself a great picture  .

2 hrs of recording makes it easy to not have to empty the data on your pc only do it when you get a chance definitely recommended from a serious techie that likes when things are simple    eric  .

it is what it is    a brainless expression that fits i picked up the flip ultra hd last week after spending time looking into all the options available  .

the vado is not sold near us  .

and the feedback is mixed the flip is meant to be remarkably simple to use  .

so i got one from the local wal mart i brought along on an overnight field trip with my son's 3rd grade class  .

big fun it is incredibly easy and fun to record the spontaneous moments of life on the flip the kids were interviewing each other and making their own movie without any help from me but    now we want to watch the video  .

andt is basically diy at this point [keep in mind that this is happening over memorial day weekend and it is definitely unfair for me to base my grade for support during a holiday    but i am annoyed because i have grandparents here that want to watch the new fangled hd camcorder footage  .

so customer support is getting thrown under the bus along with me  .

i am not going alone  .

the site says the minimum requirements to run the software is an intel pentium 4 2  .

0 ghz and at least 512 mb of ram our home pc has an amd 64 3200+ and 512 mb of ram  .

it cannot support the software  .

i wanted to know if it would be worthwhile to add ram , or if the processor is too slow (even though the athlon is closer to 3  .

2 ghz)  .

not a question that could be answered  .

i is read and then emailed the requirements as posted on the website so rather than editing a movie    i figured we can watch the raw footage on the hdtv  .

i have an hdmi cable so i read the minimal advice offered on the website    connected it to our hdtv  .

nothing i have tried every setting on the tv  .

just not getting any sound or picture i spoke with tech support  .

they read from the website's help section word for word  .

basically said they couldn  .

t help  .

tried to say maybe it is the cable that is the issue couple of problems with that explanation  .

the cable works fine with other electronics and flip does not have any of their over priced hdmi cables in stock  .

and haven  .

t for a while they sent an email saying just that  .

thank you for contacting us while many accessories may be compatible with the flip , we do not currently recommend any one product specifically mainly due to our inability to test and certify the breadth of products on the market we apologize for being unable to provide you with a more definite answer , and we hope you won  .

t hesitate to contact us further  .

not sure what i would contac them further about i am sure as soon as i figure out the hdtv problem and the system requirements , i will love this thing  .

but right now everyone is wondering why dad buys technology that he cannot operate .

i had to replace my 10 year old vhs    c camcorder  .

if i took my camcorder out once a month , that is a lot , so i is looking for a general purpose camcorder just for those special occasions like birthdays etc  .

so far i like this camcorder  .

there's just one issue with it  .

if you are playing a video on the tv , it will play only one scene , then stop  .

you then have to hit play again  .

the only remedy is to dump the scenes on your computer , make them into a movie , then download it back to the camcorder where you can now play the scenes uninterrupted  .

other than that it's good so far  .

looks cool , easy to use , easy to upload , perfect amount of memory , decent software , and relatively cheap  .

if you just want to film your friends acting stupid , or take it along on a vacation , this does the job  .

if you want more flexibility while filming , this may not cut it (but be ready to shell out $400    $600 for a decent digital camcorder) for the money , it does the job well  .

and , it is very well put together (does not look or feel cheap) .

a friend of mine has the flip hd and i have the creative vado  .

i compared the 2 and the flip hd has a bit better audio sound than the vado but the reason i bought the vado is that it has a wider angle than the flip and also comes w/ mini hd cable  .

for me the creative vado hd has more bang for the money .

i received this great little camera as a gift yesterday  .

my husband also thought to buy hdmi cables , but we didn't think to get a $3 usb cable  .

the camera's usb connector that flips out is ok if you clearance around the usb port on your computer  .

i have an older dell laptop that i have docked at home to a 19 inch monitor/usb keyboard/wacom tablet  .

i have to disconnect either my ac power cord or my monitor and keyboard  .

not good so i plugged it into my husband's desktop and moved the software setup files and a few short videos we recorded to my laptop using our home network the software installed ok , but it won't see my video files unless i plus the camera in directly to my laptop  .

unless you download through the camera it does not exist  .

the software should be able to open other video files you may have on you hard drive but it does not so now i have to go find and buy a $3 f    m extender usb cable somwhere before i can use the free software so if you are buying this as a gift (we bought another one for our son so he can send us videos of our grandson easier) you may want to include a usb and hdmi cable set as well  .

flip video store has a set of 3 usb cables for $24  .

99 ; way too expensive imo if i had been able to edit my videos right out of box i'd give this camera 5 stars  .

all they had to do is put a $3 cable in the box  .

this camera is pretty much what i expected for the money  .

i wanted something to film a new grandchild with , and this is perfect  .

if you want to do more , such as take on vacation or use for outdoor/wildlife , you should consider a camera with more features .

this is a good unit to capture those short precious moments without carrying a large bulky videorecorder  .

optics are of course not top of the line (look at the size of the thing) ; night vision and image stabilization are non existent  .

dispite it's shortcomings ; i love it  .

it takes about 2 secs to start , sound is great  .

picture is good/acceptable for this type of use , but don't shoot sceenes for a hollywood movie with this one i take it on hiking trips , far away from a power supply and the fact that the unit can operate on ordinary aa batteries is good i've seen that someone has commented on lack of expandable memory  .

this unit can store 2 hours of video and come on you do not store 2 hours of video on this thing ; it'  .

s not a storage device  .

you will have transferred the video to a pc long before that  .

it is easy to transfer video via the usb2 interface  .

it mounts as a harddrive in windows  .

use file explorer or the flip software  .

but what is it with the lens glass  .

it breakes quite easily  .

i had the flip i my pocket with together with some other stuff (it is protected by the pouch) , and the glass brakes  .

it's very fragile and non    replaceable  .

no i have to pick out the pieces , find some glass to cut and glue it back in there .

very easy and convinient camcorder  .

good quality still vide  .

but dont expect it replace a real camcorder as it freezes on moving the camcorder or taking moving objects  .

besides it does not have night vision or very good zoom .

overall , this camera is not my favorite  .

i would not recommend it to anyone  .

there is a really short battery life on this camera  .

the lens scratches very easily  .

also , in a lot of my videos , i realized that the camera is hard to get a good grip on  .

i have had my flip for just over 6 months and i noticed the the video quality is decreasing  .

not even a year  .

do not buy  .

add image stabilization and you have a winner  .

i would rather take short videos of the same quality on my 60$ camera (eliminates the need for a second device) than to carry around this thing that is slippery and will provide the same results as my camera  .

a good kids toy .

i received this camcorder as a gift is so excited to use it  .

out of the box it seemed easy to use  .

i shot a couple of test videos with it and is excited to check out the software  .

when i plugged it in to my computer it downloaded the software but i is unable to view the videos i had just shot  .

i is able to access them from the dcim folder  .

we tried istalling the software on another computer and had the same issue  .

we downloaded the most recent software from the flip website but that did not help either so i contacted customer serivce  .

i explained the problem to them they got back to me about 18 hours later asking for all the technical information about my computer and the camera (which i had already supplied them with)  .

i sent them all the requested information and recieved a message back the next day that they were forwarding my issue to the engineering department  .

over a week has gone by and i have not received even an acknowledgement of my issue from the engineering department , nor do i have any sort of resolution  .

the customer service department did not suggest i exchange the camcorder or really offer any sort of real customer service  .

i am returing the camcorder and am very disappointed .

overall , i am not completely happy with the product  .

200 is a lot of money and what you get is not giving you the feeling of a durable material  .

looks like the cheapest materials used and glued together  .

i would say their encoder needs a little more work in terms of picture quality  .

their firmware is good enough except it needs some enhancements such as easier navigating and faster fast forwards and rewinds  .

i is trying to playback a video i have recorded and show a certain time to my friends but the fast forward is not really fast  .

also you have to hold the right button to fast forward and if your finger just slips a little it will skip to the next video and you have to come back and start fast forwarding from the beginning  .

bad firmware design in that sense  .

it took me 5mins to show it  .

i could have just played back without fast forwarding the lens glass is very fragile  .

mine broke in the first day of usage  .

it is inside its soft fabric case , and accidentally it touch my pocket where i had my cell phone in  .

voila , it is broken  .

these little glasses are not replaceable which i am having a hard time understanding because it is just a simple glass glued in front of the lens  .

the customer support is not helpful and not understanding  .

bad attitude  .

if i had a chance i would have returned it and not buy this again .

sony has a better solution at a not musch greater price .

small and pocketable , but the lack of an external memory slot is unforgivable  .

i would never buy such a piece of equipment with that misconception .

i do not recommend this product  .

my first problem after erasing is the memory  .

my camera is empty , however i only had 12 minutes left  .

after changing the second problem is the battery pack  .

i is charging and it is saying over and over   check battery pack  .

i decided to change again , and my third try is again so bad  .

this time the problem is so weird  .

it is saying over and over it is really hot need cool down without being used previously again i really recommend no to buy this product  .

it is awful  .

i only payed to get in troubles over and over .

for $200 this has a horrible zoom  .

i feel like i cannot ever zoom quite close enough  .

i also pulled it out today and the lens is cracked  .

this is not even 90 days old , it is not dropped , i stored it in is worthless protective cover , and did not carry it with me all times  .

when i called flip they would not even listen to my rant  .

this does not fall under the warranty and they do not offer any means to fix it  .

it is suggested that i take it to a camera store and try to fix it myself  .

i let the company know that i is very dissappointed and would let others know that they are selling a poorly made product that breaks easily and does not work like described .

we bought this product with high hopes  .

it worked nicely for about 3 days , then we recieved a 'too hot' error message  .

we worked with flip customer service and applied many 'fixes' , but nothing worked  .

we shipped it back for repair  .

unfortunately , we wo not see the camera for at least 3    4 weeks  .

i wish they would just give my money back so i could buy another product  .

really , this is the worst experience i've ever had with any kind of 'techie' product  .

very disappointing , to say the least .

no optical zoom  .

digital zoom only 2x   this results lot of limitations  .

we can not shoot close objects  .

distant objects can not be zoomed no auto/manual focus   this is a side effect of 'no optical zoom'  .

fixed 30 frame per sec (fps) which case flicker while shooting fast moving objects  .

there is no facility to change resolution or fps  .

we have to use some software after downloading the video usually shows 'excess heat' message during battery charging flip type usb connector not convenient  .

we can not directly connect the camera to a pc as the camera will hang on the usb connector .

do not waste your money and if you do make sure to use it a lot in the first 2 weeks so you will have a chance to send it back while it is still on warranty .

never deal with this company _ how can they sell something that has an easy essential part that cannot be repaired  .

their customer service is so pitiful it's a joke  .

try this , and if that doesn't work , call us back  .

after numerous frustrating phonecalls to them and trying various fixes which don't work , they tell you to remove the battery and let the camera sit for 48    72 hours to allow energy to discharge  .

all of this on a brand new camera they know there are problems with the cameras , but they continue to sell them and expect the customer to fiddle endlessly with the unit to try to get it working  .

they won't issue you a return authorization until you've jumped through all of the hoops they set up , and they refuse to refund your money  .

they also expect you to pay all shipping fees , brokerage costs etc and completely ignore letters sent to their head office  .

i sent three separate complaint letters and haven't received one response the return merchandise authorization number is your on    line complaint number to customer service , but they don't tell you this until you've jumped through all of the hoops they set out i certainly would not buy another flip product , or any product from pure digital  .

beware  .

do some on    line research before becoming involved with them .

my camera freezes , shows a blank screen when recording and the timer stays in 0  00  00  .

the camera is only six months old and not used much  .

tech support not helpful  .

do not buy flip  .

flip is a horrible product    it is wrong and immoral to sell a defective product that will erase your memories with out notice  .

their only resolution is to send you a new one (if still under your 90 warranty)  .

they do not care about the memories or media attached to their defective products and it is seriously concerning  .

do not buy flip if you value the memories you are trying to capture .

i received this item for christmas this year and have already returned it  .

it is a lot of fun to use on christmas day  .

the lcd screen is very clear and the video seemed steady  .

however , when i plugged it into my computer and my hdtv , the picture as very grainy and not steady at all  .

if this item were fifty bucks and you wanted to give it as a gift to a five year old , then yes , i would say it would be worth it  .

do not waste your money  .

i wish i had read the reviews before purchasing  .

seems like this product works for 90 days (coincidentally with the 90    day warranty) and then stops  .

lots of people have this problem and there is no customer support  .

i would absolutely not recommend this .
