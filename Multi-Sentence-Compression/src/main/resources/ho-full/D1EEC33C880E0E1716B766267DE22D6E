our first 'landing ' at the hotel china town inn did not start very well .
we were kinda shocked by the spartan look of the room and the general area ( although it is right in the middle of china town ) .
internet on the 5th floor did not work , and i investigated the source of the 'real problem ' with the it guy .
he actually put in a new router and it worked perfectly from then on .
venturing out , we felt much better , and chinatown eating is superb .
this area is the best chinatown i have ever seen for markets ( including nyc ) .
now i mentioned the room .
yes , it is spartan but it has all you need ( better bring a small 240 volt hair dryer however ) .
a/c worked great , there were places to hang clothes and the bathroom/shower was very good and clean .
i would highly suggest getting the superior room with two beds ( one double , one single ) , so you have room to spread out '' or 'fish ' into your luggage .
that room is only about 9 dollars more but well worth it .
we paid the equivalent of $ 37 .
00/night ( usd ) for that room .
the mattresses were great ( nice and firm ) , and one person on staff was especially helpful .
the hotel is within walking distance to the pasar seni train stop , and we found this to be a very convenient location at an excellent price , to get there from pasar seni , simply walk out , turn right , and walk towards a large green sign advertising a university .
enter chinatown entrance there and look carefully for sign to the hotel while inside chinatown market area .
the hotel is somewhat hidden , so after you find it , you will have to walk back behind the market activity and into the main building ( a storefont ) and look for the door to the hotel on the left side .
oh and . . .
no ripoffs or price switching at this hotel either ( like we had in singapore ) .
recommended !
