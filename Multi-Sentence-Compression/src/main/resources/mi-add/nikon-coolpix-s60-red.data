the product will work fast , zoom , and do whatever you tell it to do  .
bottom line is , this is a great product  .
this camera is really fun to use  .
i find using the included stylus works better than using my finger and i have mine on the camera cord which keeps it handy  .
reading the manual really helps to learn all of the camera's functions and i have expermented using all the settings and comparing the results  .
i'm pleased with the quality of the pictures as well as the movie feature  .
i have an 8gb card so i have plenty of space to record  .
this may not be a good choice for an experienced photographer , but for someone just wanting a fun easy camera that takes great pictures , then i would highly recommend this one .
don't listen to the other reviews  .
nearly everyone is judging this camera by dslr standards , and some of the stuff is just bad luck  .
for example , the battery does not typically die after 37 pictures  .
i've taken over 200 on a single charge  .
206 , to be exact , and i probably could have done more  .
i am not saying that the person who could only shoot 37 pictures on a charge is lying , i'm just saying that this doesn't happen normally  .
a lot of nikon cameras use this battery , and of the 4 or so people i know who use this , none of them have anywhere near this much of a problem , if at all this camera , compared to quite a few cameras (including the brand new coolpix s70 , olympus fe    46 , sony cybershot dsc    s650 , and the sanyo xacti e6) , shoots phenomenal pictures  .
accurate color , perfect focus , etc  .
the only picture    taking drawback is in extremely low    light situations , unless you have a tripod and you change the wb  .
if you do not , i'd recommend using the flash  .
if you're looking for a point    and    shoot , which you are if you're reading this , this shoots great pictures , especially for the money  .
quite a few pictures , if you can do it , are easily comparable to a professional camera one problem that i had is that the sensor had moved down showing an outline of a circle on the pictures  .
this is nothing to worry about , though , for three reasons  .
one , i bought this camera refurbished  .
this will almost definitely not happen if you buy the camera  .
two , it's covered under warranty  .
three , if you shoot in 16  9 (which i recommend) , it'll crop it out if you buy this camera , you should buy a screen protector or a case  .
otherwise , it's a great buy .
i love this camera  .
it's a great point shoot camera  .
it's a tad heavier than new digital cameras , but it's good  .
the touch is great ; not slow .
i love the fact that it has an automatic scene selector and of course the touch screen  .
lots of places say that the touch screen takes some getting used to but the first day i bought the camera i found that it is very easy to use  .
the pics come out great at night (i found that the party scene takes better nighttime pictures)  .
i use this camera everyday and it is awesome and easy to use have fun  .
if some one knows how to make the quality better pleaseee email me at siesieg@yahoo  .
com because this really is a sweet camera and im dissapointed that my nikon s4 takes better quality pictures .
i've been an avid canon user for many years  .
for my point    and    shoot i thought i would give nikon a shot  .
i'm not impressed  .
when taking pictures using this type of camera i want to be able to pick up the camera and start shooting very quickly  .
otherwise you lose the shot  .
in 'auto' mode i expect that shot to be accurate most all of the time , but it is not with this camera  .
it seems to have a very difficult time knowing when to apply the flash  .
many times i've been indoors and in auto mode and the flash does not go off and the picture is dark if i'm going to have to go through and calculate every setting on the camera prior to shooting , i'll use my dslr .
i thought this camera is very cool looking but looks can be deceiving it has a slow touch screen and all the cool things about the camera do not work as great as you see on the commercial  .
when you try and slide pictures with your finger the camera thinks you are trying to zoom in  .
when you turn the camera to get a different view of the picture it sometimes freezes in that posistion  .
the lcd screen has low resoultion so your pics do not look that great after you take them  .
i took my camera back after using it for one weekend .
aston kutcher makes these pictures look good , but they don't turn out that way  .
when i uploaded them to the computer the qualoty of the pictures , as i is hoping , did not improve at all  .
i liked the large touch screen and it is responsive  .
also the zoom is not nearly as good as it should be  .
hope i helped  .
overall this is a bad buy shoulda did my research 1st  .
dont buy  .
i want another samsung  .
i is looking for a point an shoot camera to carry when i could take my nikon slr  .
i picked this due to the internal zoom  .
i is so disappointed , i returned the camera .
everything has been said by others already but i would like to add that it's a shame that with a screen so big , you cannot transfer other photos or movies from your computer to the camera to carry around  .
the camera cannot display other jpg's  .
do not buy this if you want this for social events and may at some time want other people to use it to take pictures for you  .
its a foreign creature and is not very user friendly at all .
dont buy it  .
not at all worth buying .
nikon missed the boat on that one  .
for the money , i think there are better cameras around  .
if the desire is to show    off to friends , then this camera might be for you  .
otherwise , if the goal is to take pictures , get something else very disapointed .
its crap  .
relesed too soon  .
more r d should have went into it .
do not waste your money , unless it's under $100  .
what a huge disappointment , i had purchased this camera for my wife as one of her christmas gifts  .
at first i blamed her for taking lousy pictures sorry baby it is not you  .
i played with it and have been an avid photographer for over 25 years and determined it just came down to the camera  .
i have owned top of the line nikon slr's for a number years and is very fond of their quality  .
i currently own a canon digital slr  .
against my better judgement i bought it thinking it would be a neat camera for her to take pictures , plus she loved the ad campaigns with ashton  .
ashton             this is for you buddy , you should not put your self in such a position to promote this piece of s  for a camera .
do not buy this camera  .
my husband is a photographer who only uses nikon cameras so he bought this expecting it to be good quality  .
he's taking it back right now and says nikon should be embarassed by putting such a product on the market .
i wanted a nice camera for any occasion  .
do not buy this camera  .
it has slow responses for touchscreen and was not worth a dime .
worst camera for the money i've ever seen  .
stay away  .
looks like a great gift for you wife/daughter but it's not worth $1 , much less $300  .
if you have to have a touch screen , go with a sony instead .
stay away might take good close up pics but if anyone moves its so blurry you have to delete it .
do not buy this camera , the pictures are very dissappointing  .
it broke after a month    i have sent it back to repair and after i got back after 2 weeks it broke again  .
i sent it for the second time to the repair and when i got it back guess what  .
yes it broke for the third time  .
when i spoke to them they said to me that if it will brake for the third time they will replace it    and that is a lie    every time i speak to people from nikon they say something tottaly different every time  .
i did not even have a chance to take any nice pictures becasue the camera is at the repair most of the time  .
i have paid for this camrea over 300$ and still cant believe that nikon does not stand behind theyr product  .
im really unsatisfied not only from the product but from the nikons service as well .
if you want to buy this camera , you must be like my wife , you bought it because of the commercials but sorry no amount of sugar coating will leave a good taste in your mouth from this purchase , it is a burn  .
touch screen, thats IT; takes crappy pics all around. my 3 year old canon schooled it. dont buy it.
The look is nice, red color is great. Thats about it.; No customization allowed beyond the presets. All photos appear blurry and soft around the edges. Not worth the money.
fast, lots of options, user friendly; I did not abuse this camera at all, took pretty good care, and camera died after just over a year....Bad camera! Bad camera!
Other than my wife states that it is a cute and sleek looking camera.; Lousy pictures. No adjustments for image stabilization. Very grainy whether from LCD screen, computer screen or developed and printed picture.
looks pretty, and cool because not a lot of people have touch screens.; high precentage of pictures come out horrible, even when set to auto.
the touch screen and selecting your own home screen wallpaper; The automatic scene selector doesn't always give you the best scene to take a picture with.
An impressive list of features.; Using the features is difficult. The screen is not always responsive. I often have to select things several times. Pictures are not as 'auto' as I'd like.
Love the commercial....cool new touch screen; Takes horrible pics, auto focus works on every other pic, touch screen too sensitive I'm always touching the zoom or going back to the main screen, finger is always in the pic cuz camera lens is too close to top, have water bubbles on most pics
this camera has no pro's; this camera takes the worst pictures every picture is blurry eveyr auto scene function is wrong i have gotten one or two good pictures out of 1000 seriously if anyone reviews this camera as good they must have some financial interest in its success
Looks Flashy; Terrible pictures, half of them were blurry. Lighting is terrible. The battery died after taking a whole 37 pictures. I uploaded the pictures hoping they would look better...it didn't
Touch screen big deal! I thought the point of a camera was to take good photos.; The whole unit is expensive junk
Video is handy. I actually liked the touch screen!; Terrible photos. In full sun or with the flash it always picked the wrong ISO. Manual ISO helped a little, but not enough to overcome the muddy pictures. All pictures seemed washed out.
Great pictures (Don't trust the reviews! This is a point-and-shoot, not a DSLR). Great interface AS LONG AS YOU UPGRADE to v1.1 (http://support.nikontech.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13783). Durable. Accurate color. Shoots in 16:9 if you choose; Had a little bit of a lens problem, but it was covered under warranty. Even so, it was so minor that I didn't bother to send it in.
Only the look is good; We found difficulty in operating the touch screen, pics does not have clarity, most of it were blur. Color in the pics were dull than the actual. All together not at all worth buying it. I just used it for 2 days and returned.
The 3.5 inch screen provides a good view. Icons are easy to see and use. You can use it as a point and shoot on auto, but you can also control the settings. The 5X zoom brings the subject close and in good focus. Nice for carrying in a pocket.; Battery doesn't last very long, so I purchased a second one as a backup.
Looks cool. Big screen. Smile detector. Blink detector. Touch the screen to focus area. Touch screen is pretty dumb proof for point &#38; shooters when the icons are there but choosing some settings is counter intuitive.; Big screen can't take advantage of other photos/movies on chip. Propriety wires. Battery life sucks &#38; only a low battery indicator.. Low light pictures with no flash come out orange. Big wide screen &#38; hdmi out but movies are only vga!
It broke after a month- I have sent it back to repair and after i got back after 2 weeks it broke again . I sent it for the second time to the repair and i got back and guess what ? Yes it broke for the third time. There is a lens error; NIKON is being really unprofesional about it and they dont want to replace it for a new camera- ITS a LEMOn - i have never droppped it or do anything that i should not have - There is a error that shows up on a screen and the camera will not turn on
Big LCD screen; All controls, with the exception of the on/off and shoot buttons are on the touch screen. Its a cool concept except the touch screen is not very efficient. I have a lot of patience but this made me crazy.
Slick design, very attractive idea on minimizing the number of buttons around by having all the functions on the screen.; Does not take good pictures. Used it on a trip and took ~500 pictures. The outside ones are relatively OK, but 3/4 of inside ones are throw-away. Screen is slow to your input, and so is the ability to take pictures. Going back to Costco.
The camera looks awesome and being able to write on the screen is kind of neat.; LCD is low quality, touch screen has slow response and pictures do not really appear crisp even when you put it on the computer.
It looks good, concept of a touch screen is a nice idea; This camera is useless! Of all the pictures I have taken, most need to be deleted. I have had to delete inauguration pictures, and pictures of the birth of my first son. Don't waste your money.
The large touch screen is very neat and responds well. The camera has a very sleek design that looks very flashy.; This camera take fuzzy grainy pictures.. The lens is positioned so when you go to taek a picture your fingers will get in too.. to over-priced for the quality of pictures.
I love the touch screen and most of the features like being able to draw on your pictures.; I was surprised to see that this camera takes very low quality pictures. Maybe I am using it wrong but i hate the quality. When the camera is on auto either my face is too white and i dont have a nose or i am fine but behind me is really grainy.
