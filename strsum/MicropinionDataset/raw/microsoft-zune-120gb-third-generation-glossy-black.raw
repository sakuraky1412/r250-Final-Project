Pros:. Endless library? No problem! Has 120 GB!!! which is insane! almost as much as some of the older external hard drives out there!. 
Cons:. Games are okay, headphones aren't the best. 
Summary:. Bottom line? If your a real music buff and have a huge library this is the mp3 player for you! No stupid apps, and no headaches i love it, had the Zune for a couple years now and still haven't used up all the space. Sound quality is amazing which is what really matters not how many apps there are for it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Battery Life. 120GB. FM Radio. 
Cons:. No HD Radio. No AM Radio. No EQ support. 
Summary:. The Zune120 is a 3rd gen Zune device and keeps the flavor of the previous HDD based models. Though it is now outclassed (except in capacity) by the Zune HD, It is still one of the best PMPs on the market. 

$$;
Pros:. The software is amazing. WAY better than Apples ITunes. Picture quality is great, Crystal clear movies, Sound quality is amazing also.. 
Cons:. Screen is exposed and can be scratched, The Games feature needs updates... that's it.... 
Summary:. Listen, If you're considering a Top-Of-The-Line MP3 player, the zune is the way to go. It's just that simple. It is the best, and now with the Zune HD rivaling the I-Touch and I-Phone, it will stay that way. Microsoft hasn't been great with their Vista OS, but they've hit the ground running in the MP3 market, I think the best is yet to come with the Zune. 

$$;
Pros:. No Entry Provided. 
Cons:. No Entry Provided. 
Summary:. No Entry Provided. 

$$;
Pros:. I had a Ipod Video and gave it to my son after trying the Zune. The Ipod wheel control is hesitant at best. I cant wait fir the Zune HD. Podcast control is excellent. Battery life is great.. 
Cons:. With the popularity of Ipod, Zune accesories are hard to find, but Best Buy does have them. Online as well, but I want to touch and feel.. 
Summary:. Microsoft Zune is the better choice. Controls are the number one feature. Battery life is superb. The software and online abilities are top notch, I had a much easier time with podcasts and music. Zune allows you to move ahead in time on a program, Ipod goes to the next selection everytime. Zune HD will kick Ipod to the curb.. 

$$;
Pros:. Zune Pass....bargin for a family. Durable...mines with me everywhere. Zune software much improved. It does exactly what it is supposed to do.. Price. 
Cons:. Headphones...get a real pair. Software a little tricky when switching computers.. 
Summary:. Think one of the things that is left off in the $180 a year is that includes it for THREE Zunes...not just one. Now that Zune also includes 10 downloads a month DRM it is a no brainer for me. I have one and my 2 preteen kids have 1 each...so $5 a month or $60 year for each one is the best bargin I pay for. Plus it allows me to stream the music from 3 pcs via the software so i use that at work and home some too and review whole songs before downloading, no 30 second clips.. I have converted a couple of friends with "kids" from jr. to college who got tired of the ITunes bill at $35 a month for each user then thier own.. Very very Family Friendly device if you want one for you and others to share the Zune Pass.. 

$$;
Pros:. I can get to my music with ease, and arrange my playlists with my favorite songs with ease.. 
Cons:. It could use EQ buttons and better games would be awsome, and maybe like some DJ software like Virtual DJ cause the ipod dj software sucks.. 
Summary:. The Zune has more space for all your favorite music. Zune Market Place is awsome. For when your looking for that new album is out. Zunes social is cool because you can share music with other Zunners and for 120GB MP3 player you can't beat the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Zune Pass, Channels, Buy From FM, Marketplace on Device, Large Screen, Free Games, Community Games, Clock (FINALLY!), Great Radio Reception, Keep 10 songs on Zune Pass, Zune Pad reacts very well, Smooth Interface, all devices get software update. 
Cons:. Removal of "quicklist" playlist and replaced it with "now playing", not amazing battery life, PC only, software is a little glitchy at times, many of the new features require zune pass. 
Summary:. The Zune is paced with many features that the iPod classic had never and probably will never have. I definitely like all of the new features in the Zune including the buying from FM, and the marketplace on the Zune. the only bad thing is that you need a Zune Pass for most of those features. The Zune finally got a clock and a screen lock. The battery has never died on me when I've continuously used it (I fall asleep with it on.) It was nice that Microsoft finally added some simple games to add to the community games that were originally available. I do not like how the quicklist playlist is gone and the now playing playlist replaced it. The actual 3.0 software was VERY glitchy, but the 3.1 software got rid of all of the bugs. Its upsetting that the Ipod already had the popularity factor because if they started at the same time, the would be a real competition.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great size screen.. Alot smaller than if looks on paper.. The best navigation ever.. Easy to use and see menu.. Great sound and just plain awsome.. 
Cons:. The front is fringerprint prone.. No premium earphones.. 
Summary:. Just pure awsomeness to its purest form plain and simple.. 

$$;
Pros:. storage - 120 gb (gotta love it). screen - its great for watching movies. interface - slick and smooth. software - better than itunes. games - you can make your own and put user made games (i love Valgards Fate). 
Cons:. only one thing. the bulkiness.. but eventually you get used to it and it actually fells pretty good in the palm of you hand. even though i like the matt finish design from the 80, i can at least use it as a mirror (lol).. 
Summary:. this product may not be slick and smooth like the ipod. but its user interface is killer compared to the ipod classic. and you gotta love the huge screen, i enjoy watching movies and podcasts which they have a huge selection of. the software is easy to use better than itunes and i recommend everyone to buy it. they gave it a biased and bad review only because they are supported by apple.. 

$$;
Pros:. everything. 
Cons:. accessories are next to impossible to find. You'd think, huh?? I love it on a Zune speaker dock. 
Summary:. I like the fact that Microsoft's firmware updates allow 1st and 2nd generation Zunes not to be tossed out in the garbage. To me, that says a lot for Zune. I love the ZunePass and have downloaded tons of music. Since I have no intention of dropping my subscription, I don't worry about losing it. Plus, the 10 free songs per month with paid subscription (to keep) makes it worthwhile. I also love the FM capabilities RSBD. Or is it RBSD. Anyway, when a radio station shows call letters and title and artist playing - - although not all radio stations have that. I haven't used "Buy From FM" but assume it would be good. All in all, a good player. And also, I bought the extended warranty, so no worries here.. I also love their Playlists. My only problem with it is that when I download a playlist, it treats each song as an album when there's only one song there. Maybe it's something I'm doing wrong.. 

$$;
Pros:. Now into my 3rd year of flawless perfomance with my original 1st generation Zune, I could not be happier with this product, software and support. The latest software release allows me easily make whatever changes I want to ALL of my mp3's.. 
Cons:. Only one--I can't play/sort music by 'Genre', 'ARTIST', and then 'Song". 
Summary:. Going all the way back to my original IPod purchase in 2001 (I repurchased twice due to faulty workmanship), I have felt that Apple provided an inferior product--both functionally and technically. Microsoft's Zune's desktop software is much more open than iTunes as far as allowing me to better manage and access my music (both purchased on freeloaded), as well as acquiring new music through the Marketplace, Radio and the Social. Once you make the switch, you will never go back.. 

$$;
Pros:. Better than the IPOD. 
Cons:. Need s an Online Browser. 
Summary:. Better than the IPOD. 

$$;
Pros:. subscription option. software interface. updates offered to old units. 
Cons:. can't access as file device. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Good sound and video quality, very nice interface , zune pad is great , wireless sync from my laptop. 
Cons:. Premium earphones are gone , no EQ (but i dont use it ) most of the game available are boring (only one that i play is Space Battle). 
Summary:. This is hands down the best Hard Drive Mp3 Player , it is my favorite after trying sansa e250 , archos 604 , ipod nano , creative zen and Ipod 5th Generation. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, 90% DRM-Free music, and critically acclaimed beautiful 3.0 desktop software.. An upgrade from iTunes spreadsheet looking player that sneaks unrelated programs onto my computer by default like apple updater, quicktime, safari and MobileMe.. 
Cons:. Get this software on my cell phone already.. 
Summary:. Dive in and never look back at a significant upgrade to your music experience.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Video playback and music sounds wonderful on this device. The 15.00 fpr sll your can eat music and being able to keep 10 songs a moth as your own is killer. I live the zone I encourage you to try it out I think you will be impressed.. 
Cons:. I have not really found anything wrong with the machine. 
Summary:. I have bad 4 ipods fromt he 30 t0 the 120 but after playing wiht a zune 30 I WAS HOOKED, he improvements ot the software has been great. I recommend this product without a second th9ought... 

$$;
Pros:. Works excellent with SYNC on ford vehicles. Turns on and off with vehicle start up and shut down. Zune Pass is awesome and easy to use. Big easy to use display screen. Cost for subscription service is far less than having to buy each song.. 
Cons:. Haven't found any con's as of yet.. 
Summary:. If you love music and want a nice Mp3 player this is the one!. 

$$;
Pros:. Big Screen, touchpad, 6 games, multiplayer games, buy from radio and marketplace, many podcasts, budget for storage, sound quality, zune premium earphones, interface, durability and scratch resistant, organized, and social and wifi sharing... 
Cons:. battery life, thickness, wireless could use improvment a bit. 
Summary:. This zune has amazing sound quality and the interface is amazing. the newest games, space battle, sudoku and checkersd are awesome and free. you can play texas hold em and checkers with a friend wirelessly over 30 feet. the screen is impossibly scratch resistant, u have to see it to believe it. the touchpad is awesome. you can see yuor fellow zuners profiles on your zune, and with a zune pass, get any song on the marketplace and radio for free. i lovew the zune, because it always updates, and gets the exact same features as the new ones. this 180 is a perfect gift, and it feels like new every time it updates. the only thing that is a crasher to this beautiful produuct is the battery life. the battery life sucks and i always have it in mind while watching a movie or tv show. its a great product and cheap for its features, i would recommend it. and hopefully in the next update they increase the battery life!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome sound quality, great interface, an insurmountable amount of storage, a sweet screen, and a shmexy touchpad.. 
Cons:. doesnt include the premium headphones or that little carry case that the last one had.. 
Summary:. First, just by looking at the Zune you can tell it's awesome. Then when you get to listen to it, you can hear that it's awesome. Using the touchpad is extremely easy and pretty cool to boot. It is also very accurate. I haven't tried the games but then again I didn't buy one of these for the little games it has. The battery life is alright and watching videos on the big 3.2 inch glass screen is quite the awesome. Zune is totally better by the way than the ipod in my opinion. I've gone through ipods and people just like them because theyre popular. They fail at life otherwise. My only advice besides obviously getting a zune, is please buy a decent set of headphones with it. Some sony buds or something.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the way the music plays and doesn't mess up!. 
Cons:. The movies always skip!. 
Summary:. Best product ever had!. 

$$;
Pros:. The Zune 120GB has a clear screen with great resolution and crisp sound. Once one gets used the software, this is a great device. It may be a bit large for some, but it's still a small package considering the features it has.. 
Cons:. The software takes some getting use to. There are not enough accessories, but most speakers are compatible with the Zune.. 
Summary:. The ipod is a good player, but the Zune 120GB is a solid buy. The software takes some getting use to, but it helps to organize your media in a decent manner. I'm not a subscription type of individual, I've always used my own music and videos to download to these devices, so if you're of the same mindset, this is the device for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, unique and catchy interface, Zune Pass, massive capacity, excellent integration with Zune software, excellent WiFi music browsing/syncing, appealing look, and excellent audio quality. 
Cons:. Still no internet browser, still no expansion capabilities (apps), no premium headphones.. 
Summary:. I love the Zune brand. I've owned a 30 gb, 80 gb, and now a 120 gb. Although the 30 was nothing tooo special, the Zune Team has pushed the envelope and made Zune a staunch threat to the iPod label. The WiFi capabilites just keep getting better (from what I understand the Zune's WiFi reaches longer than the Touch's...), and the feel of the matte finish on the back and the glossy finish on the front are definitely a surprisingly good feel. The HDD upgrade to 120 gb is matched only by the iPod, but it makes better use of it by also doubling as a video player.. The Zune will be a great platform for games and future apps, and I hope the Zune team plans to add a browser (preferably one thats different from IE) to an already feature dominant device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen with vivid colors and easy to use navigational controls. The new wireless features really set this MP# player apart from the crowd. If you have a Zune Pass you can sample and download songs right from the marketplace.. 
Cons:. Not much to say here. If you dont have a Zune Pass the features greatly diminish. Although frankly, if you havent tired the Zune Pass you are nuts.. 
Summary:. Very sleek, thinner look with glossy black and vivid screen = fantastic MP3 player for watching vids, podcasts and listening to tunes.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best Sound ever. Cheap. Well Build. 
Cons:. Takes 2 hrs to recharge before use. Transfer slow. 
Summary:. Buy One NOW!. 

$$;
Pros:. Audible.com, FM, Social Network, Subscription Service, Podcast, Video, Large Color Screen, WiFi, a multifaceted entertainment device.. 
Cons:. Costs more than simple MP3 players.. 
Summary:. Worth the extra money when compared to MP3 players.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pictures/Movies/Podcasts/Music/eBooks/FM Tuner. Has an excellent screen for watching movies. 3.0 software update includes games, and channels. The same device updates with every new software release.. 
Cons:. Battery life, no games section on Zune software.. 
Summary:. Unmatched in it's class of MP3 players.. 

$$;
Pros:. As said here, most of the updates are in the firmware and device. I'm displeased to hear that CNET completely avoided the addition of Channels which are a competitor of Apples "Genius" and Channels are very nice and well built.. 
Cons:. The size of the device and it's lesser battery life are the two major hold backs still, but carrying around 120 gigs of music, videos, and having a wi-fi store at my finger tips dulls the pain a lot.. 
Summary:. I consider the iPod an alternative to the Zune. I still use a Zune 30 but because Microsoft updates even the older released Zunes, I can still be up on 90% of the new features. Just let me say this, the Zune is well worth the money, and assuming either you have a PC or a Mac that is running windows, the Zune is a very nice device and I highly recommend it after owning two iPods previously. There are only a few small problems, mainly that since the 3.0 firmware update, a bug previously fixed by 2.5, when someone plugs in their Zune and it simply won't sync with the software or even act plugged in, has returned with the use of a more generic driver in windows for ejecting the Zune. It's a simple fix to solve the problem, but it's a temporary fix untill MS releases a patch for the problem. Also the Zune software is fairly heavy on recourses. Over all though, the organizational abilities of the Zune software completely outweigh iTunes, as well as the softwares sync speed, store integration and just overall ease of use..

$$;
Pros:. Love the zune pass, hardware is great and more complete than my ipod. 
Cons:. Not enough people on the network. 

$$;
Pros:. HUGE storage space. sleek looks. big screen. FM radio/radio downloads. WiFi sync. Decent Software. Quality Hardware. Great sound. Amazing song management. Games. integrated WiFi music store. 
Cons:. Bulky. Smudge and fingerprint magnet. 
Summary:. i like this product because its easy to use and does not crash.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large amount of space. Fairly low priced compared to similar mp3s. Amazing new features such as games, radio recording, and many others. Honestly, Ipods are getting old and its nice to see something original on the market.. 
Cons:. Complicated photo viewing system. Sometimes difficult to navigate.. 
Summary:. Honestly, this is about the coolest and sleekest mp3 I've ever had. Does not lack personality like similar apple products. Amazing video quality, large amount of space, Amazingly simple controls. All this for a fairly low price (i mean the 16gb nano chrome was 20 $ less when I went to buy it. If you want attention and satisfaction, a definit must have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great interface, excellent sound quality, 100% dependable, love the FM radio connection and social/share capabilities, terrific that I can connect it to multiple computers!!! The software is outstanding -- makes iTunes look like a spreadsheet.. 
Cons:. NO "cons" in terms of performance. I love this Zune!!! Would like to see it come in a range of colors -- other than that, this device is perfect!!. 

$$;
Pros:. -Design. -Thinness. -FM radio. -Wi-Fi sharing. -UI. -Zune Pad. -Brilliant Screen. -great sound quality. -I don't think it CAN break.... -This thing is just so...cool. 
Cons:. -Wish it included the premium earbuds. -Dedicated volume controls. -Can't run with it. -(software). 
Summary:. It was with sad remembrance that my Creative Zen Micro Photo 8gb broke, and it's feeble hard drive spun to a halt. Without wasting a second, i dove into researching, and within a week, had ordered what i considered the best player out there. Having pitted it against the iPod Classic in every way that I could, the Zune still came out as the champ, and without a moments hesitation (well, maybe a little)...I bought it within a week of it being released.. Since then, I have spent much time with it, and could not be more pleased. Though this version does not include the premium earbuds (which are amazing by the way), I managed, and started to use it heavily at school.. Day after day, brought it with me to class, plugging in when doing math homework, and putting it through a rigorous test of endurance that would ultimatly decide if i made the best choice. In the end...yes.. At the end of the day, battery life was only drained to 2/3 which i think is pretty good. The solid glass on the front does not scratch, and though it does conduct fingerprints, they wipe off easily and smoothly. Though hearing complaints about the Zune Pad, I have had no trouble with it, and actually prefer it to tactile control. The UI is stellar, providing an o-so-easy way of navigating, while delivering power and preformance unmatched. One of the best features is the ability to edit the Now Playing list, which makes it a pleasure to compile a playlist on the go.. Video playback was stellar, and I was able to watch The Illusionist without even realizing it was on a 3.2 inch screen. Seriously, it was downright enjoyable.. I referenced software because zune software was horrible at first. Kind of odd that out of all things to get wrong, Microsoft got the software out of wack. But that is all passed. I now ENJOY using the Zune software, and i must say, it whacks iTunes upside the face. (for once, a microsoft product actually looks way better than a mac product!) It's sleek, cool, and defiently won't fail to impress you. Whereas iTunes looks like a spreadsheet.. In reference to the cons listed above, I offer that I also posess a Sansa Clip, which has somewhat spoiled me. It's small, easy, with dedicated volume controls, and has nearly unmatched sound quality. So it is ONLY in comparison with the Clip that I mark the Zune down. However, if you're looking for a player that is a smaller, but doesn't sacrifice usability, get the Sansa Clip. You won't regret it. (plus it's only $70 for 2gb). For those of you that are looking for a high capacity player, the Zune is a god. It's sturdy to the point of downright rugged, has great control, an outstanding UI, and is one of the only players that just radiates awesomeness.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plenty of formats supported especially the Apple AAC for people with large iTunes collections. The sound quality is unrivaled, and the 3.2" screen is spacious. The device itself feels well-built and the matte back is really nice.. 
Cons:. Not alot of people have adopted this device for some reason.... The software could be better.. 
Summary:. This player is awesome overall, but Microsoft still has their work cut out for them if they want to really hurt the iPod.. 

$$;
Pros:. love the interface, very fast and responsive, overall way above my expectations for it. 
Cons:. none that i have found yet. 

$$;
Pros:. As an MP3/Video player, this is as good as it gets. You can never go wrong.. 
Cons:. The sofware does not organize files as well as iTunes, although I have not tried to organize it with the new one.. 
Summary:. The Zune is great and I'm loving the new software update more and more as I use it. The games, although only two have also kept me pretty occupied and I love the fact that they offer the upgrades free of charge to the old Zunes. The iPod does not offer this andPERFECT!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Marketplace now gives suggestions for music you might like! Great for finding new music! I also love the Social. I'm addicted to the new game Hexic.. 
Cons:. Nothing yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. lots of storage space. easy to sync with wireless, big screen, interface is very user friendly, Zune software is very easy to use and much more user friendly then itunes,. 
Cons:. Would like to see a web browser. wireless does drain the battery faster then I would like this is solved very easily by turning it off until you need to use it. Needs zune software for Mac. 
Summary:. This is a true story of an out of the box wow. Connected fine and loaded up with no problems, updated to firmware 3.0 with no problems as well. The updated features of the wireless, the store, games, and buy from radio are very nice. Video playback on the larger then ipod classic screen is amazing. (the ipod touch isn't really a comparable product all tough a lot of people like to compair it. It's more like a psp centered around music then games and Microsoft doesn't really have a comparable product to it as of yet. personally 32GB is a joke for a device with those features) I found the set up for wireless syncing with the Zune software to be very straight forward and painless. Another thing I like the is ability to connect to another friends computer and get unDRM music off his computer without it messing with the music that my computer synced by connecting as a guest. (something no offered by Itunes) Another thing you can do with Zunes is load up custom apps and games. This is unknown to a good percentage of people. to find out more information about it and a step by step on how to do so check out my web site http://williamrmoore.net/zunegames.aspx. There are even multi-player games that you can play with other Zunes wirelessly and IM programs. All free and developed basically like open source.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lot more sturdier than the previous version and it is very durable. Nice marketplace, and nice sound quality.. 
Cons:. Wi-Fi browsing but I guess it would be difficult to browse on the Zune considering the interfaces.. 
Summary:. Microsoft was really thinking about the future when they designed the Zune. The new Zune 3.0 update really makes older models of the Zune not obsolete unlike Apple's business plan which is to constantly release new models at a rapid pace forcing the typical Apple lover to replace his MP3 player every year.. 

$$;
Pros:. Recorded TV sync from your Windows Media Center. With a video cable, Zune plays Recorded TV/Videos on any TV (great for those who travel). Podcasting is great. 120 Gb holds everything. Zune Car pack plays audio through your FM radio. Wireless Sync. 
Cons:. iPod looks nice but the Zune's screen is TWICE the size as iPod! Size does matter!. Syncing Recorded TV takes longer then music (obviously!) but not as long as I thought it would.. 
Summary:. If you are looking for the ultimate device to partner up with your Windows Media Center and allow you to bring all your media on the road with you to watch on a bigger screen then iPod or on a hotel TV when travelling... Zune 120 is the best choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Zune has an amazing sound quality, extraordinary bass and crystal clearnesses.. Marketplace on the go.. Podcast -You'll be into podcasting in no time.. Nice UI, Easy Trackpad. FM radio - Listen and buy on the go.. 
Cons:. Simple, dull design.. Narrow accessories line.. Software takes time to get to know.. Battery life shorten with WiFi browsing.. 
Summary:. The Zune is great for who loves Music, It's not an organizer nor an internet device - it has been mainly design for entertainment in music on the go.. You'll be lovin' your Zune for a long time, The Zune team keep rollin' out the "Update for All Zune" for free, Makes you feel like having a new Zune everytime you do the update.. Zune wifi capability is still limited, you can't access wifi with on-the-web authentication, or the network with proxy server.. Screen resolution is not as high as the competitor, but it has decent bright, color and angle.. Pair with A/V pack and you'll get an HD output to your TVs.. Wireless syncing is useful for updating podcasts, music - without having to mess with any usb ports.. Battery life is "OK", with 30 hours music plays (about 20 hours in real life, with high bitrate music.). Finally, I'm happy with my Zune - and you'll be..

Pros:. large screen, wifi, radio. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. You should give it a try and you will love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen huge storage space, wifi for buying and listening songs share songs and pics customizable backgrounds, Thin, Easy UI (user interface) Pretty good Battery life. Audio books podcasts (Audio and Video) Very good alternative to the ipod.. 
Cons:. DOnt care for the glossy faceplate prefer the oone like on the zune 80 but thats really not a con wish battery could be a longer.. 
Summary:. Very good alternative to the ipod I say go to ur local best buy and try it out for yourself or a friend that has one and see if u like it if u do then i say go for it. I love mine and thinking of getting another one. Cant wait for the next zune line up.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, excellent battery life, great audio quality, user-friendly interface, wi-fi sharing and wireless music downloads, large hard drive, custom backgrounds, FM radio with RDS, video playback, I can go on.... 
Cons:. Can't wirelessly download podcasts like what you can do with music. Channels require Zune Pass. Software needs AAC encoding so I won't have to use iTunes. Should have included the premium headphones, but these standard ones suffice.. 
Summary:. Last year, I bought the short-wide iPod Nano (8GB). I thought it would suffice my music needs, but I realized the size is small when I got more music and videos would shorten the size. I could have went with the new Nano, but I decided to get the new 120GB Zune last week. First of, I once owned the classic Zune, but was turned off by it because of the crappy battery life, especially less than 3 hours with FM radio turned on. I stuck with Apple. However, I have some friend who bought the second generation Zunes last year and said they were great. When I heard that software 3.0 bought more features to the Zune, I decided to buy it. Since I have owned this new Zune (120 GB), I am impressed and believe that this product is so much better than any iPod (even though they are still good player). Once I imported my music and started listening, I noticed a huge difference in audio quality when compared to the iPod. There are no equalizers, but I don't use them anyway since they usually distort music and waste battery life. Speaking of, battery life on this thing is great. Yes, it is less than the iPod Classic, but 30 hours of audio playback is still great. It is long enough to last about a month on one charge since I basically listen to my Zune on my way to class, on trips, or working on outside class assignments. I like the user-interface and how you can import your own backgrounds. I also like the large Album Artwork display on the Now Playing Screen while still having plenty of space displaying song information. Video playback is awesome and compatible with many formats including Media Center TV recordings. Great for me since I own a HD TV tuner and can watch my recorded shows on the go. I also like that the Zune is compatible with AAC audio since it is better sounding than MP3 and all my music is AAC files. Overall, this is the best media player I have ever bought. I honestly believe that I will be satisfied by this Zune for many years.. 

$$;
Pros:. Really, the subscription music is the best.. 
Cons:. The surface does scratch fairly easily.. 

$$;
Pros:. It does everything great. The whole experience is absolutely more hardcore than Apple. From the Zune Pass all you can eat music, to the connected discovery features, and the outstanding desktop software.. 
Cons:. It does not make a good peanut butter sandwich yet, but with the investment protection of free major software updates to all Zunes ever made - if they figure out a way to do it, you'll get it on all players - FREE!. 
Summary:. It is a highly polished, very well integrated package. A music lovers dream with the Zune Pass. The iPod is very good. The Zune + Zune Pass is simply outstanding.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great desktop software, the device is solid as a tank and performs 100% all the time. Great sound quality and merges well with the Xbox 360. 
Cons:. Don't know what I can complain about really... maybe the battery life? but I've never ever run out off battery!. 
Summary:. If you're looking for a high capacity media player LOOK NO FURTHER! The iPod classic is nothing compared to this, and they cost the same.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice, big, luxurious screen. Awesome interface, everything is easily accessible. Feels great in your hand. WiFi features, like marketplace, song sharing, and wireless sync. 
Cons:. The new 3.0 update removed the "Quick List" playlist. Battery life is great, but not as good as the Classic. PC only, no Mac support. 
Summary:. First off: The Zune 120 is NOT the iPod Touch's competitor, but instead the iPod Classic. The Zune beats the Classic in features and usability, and definitely in sexiness, especially with the available Zune Originals. The iPod Touch is better than the Zune in more cases, but with less storage size (like a fifth of the size for more price). If you need a mini computer, get the Touch, if you need a great music player, get the Zune.. Overall a brilliant product. The third generation has changed very little, although the black back covering is really really sexy, more so than the 80. The glass screen is VERY scratch resistant, I have no scratches anywhere on my Zune. The WiFi rocks, with a marketplace feature added. The song sharing 3-play limit SUCKS, but I use the feature with my friends a lot. It is quite practical, especially when you want a friend to hear a song, but don't want him handling your zune for the next 3:51 that the song lasts. The games are cool, but the Beta games won't work in the new 3.0 firmware, but I didn't play Solitare that much anyways.. I have hardly had any trouble at all with my Zune, period. It has frozen once, but every product has these times. I can't count on one hand the amount of times my old iPod Classic has frozen.. Absolutely great product! Looks better than the Classic, better interface, subscription service, GOOD FUN games, new clock feature and screen lock are nice, excellent radio, and beautiful screen make this better by far than the iPod Classic, and a more pure music player than the iPod Touch.. 

$$;
Pros:. The software is amazing, I love sharing music wirelessly with friends, integrates with xbox live, zune tag is awesome, channels are spot on, beutiful software, fm radio, awesome tv colletion, wireless sync, and zune pass. 
Cons:. The battery life only lasts about a day of use if I have the volume loud while downloading music over wifi.. 
Summary:. The best MP3 ever, definitely worth $250 anyday of the week. I love the zune pass because I can download as much music as I want, even without a computer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen, big capacity.... awesome Zune software!. 
Cons:. No mac compatibility. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic Player. Great sound quality, great price. The zune 120 is definitely a big ipod classic competitor. The player works great, and i love the way zune software works and integrates with my xbox. The ipod is a good player, but the zune kills it. 
Cons:. not many extras for it yet such as full home audio integrations. Hopefully it will be like that someday though.. 
Summary:. This is a fantastic player. Apples seems to shifted focus to the ipod touch/iphone and to the new nano, where as they just kinda threw together the ipod classic with no real no features. This is giving microsoft a huge advantage in this realm. I personally almost bought an ipod classic for the storage and cost, but i HATE itunes. When i went to the store one of the zune 120s was on the shelf for the same price and i grabbed it right away as i was a first gen zune adopter that needed more storage. The new software is great as well. Its a solid alternative to itunes and "genius" i much prefer the recommendation system in the zune because it reminds me of the way that last.fm works. Gives you a small history of the band and not only who they were influenced by, but who they influence. Genius is nice for those that just want similar songs, but for music junkies that want to know about the bands as well, the zune is the way to go.. Zune and Ipod are both great players with different ways of going about doing the same thing. I prefer the way zune works and the software so thats what i went with. I would recommend trying the zune software before you buy the player though, especially if your used to itunes. Its different, but in a very good way. One thing i do like is that i dont have to make a playlist for EVERYTHING like in itues. if i want to burn i cd i just drag and drop on where as in itunes you make a playlist and it stays there. i eventually had hundreds of playlists.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, nice menu, easy to use software, fast syncing, wireless syncing, FM radio, great sound no EQ required if you have good headphones/speakers.. 
Cons:. Sometimes syncing doesn't start or takes a long time to begin and a restart is sometimes required. This doesn't happen very often.. Zune software didn't recognize all of my album art. Had to manually point it to the jpg files.. 
Summary:. I'm very glad I found this product in Canada. They do not sell it directly in retail stores here, but it was on ebay. We need more competition up here, Apple is pretty much running the show, and I can't stand them. Microsoft needs to get the Zune Marketplace up here. I'm not a MS fanboy, they just happen to have better product most of the time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice large screen with excellent user friendly functions.. Excellent sound quality.. Large memory capacity.. 
Cons:. Battery life is left wanting but not terrible.. A little large for pocket carry but that is offset by the large screen. 
Summary:. A truely great multi-media device with excellent memory capacity and user friendly interface that is easily used one handed. The large screen makes watching videos a more pleasing experience than its' Ipod counterpart. In order to get the most out of the Zune you really need the Zune Pass. The Zune Pass really cranks this device into high gear. I have a wide range of music taste and listen to a lot of comedy albums and the Zune Pass allows me to add to and change my music and comedy albums as often as I wish while maintaining plenty of memory for movies and video clips. Battery life leaves a lot to be desired compaired to my sons Sony Walkman but is plenty good for a single days use even when watching videos. However if downloading music straight to the Zune via the built in wifi you can actually see the battery meter drain right in front of your eyes. I have usb ports in my work vehicle and wall usb adapters, as well as two computers, so for me keeping it charged is not a problem but if you don't have constant access to a charger you could find battery life a problem.. All in all the Zune 120 is a great player, easy to use, and large memory for tons of entertainment.. 

$$;
Pros:. Some pros are:. 1) Large, nice 3.2 inch display. 2) 120gb hard drive capacity. 3) Customizable backgrounds. 4) Slick user interface and smooth controls. 5) Pretty good for games. 6) Very clear fm radio. 7) Podcast support. 
Cons:. My main complaints are:. 1) Glossy front smudges too easily. 2) It is a little bit bulkier than the ipod classic. 3) Slightly unreliable battery. 
Summary:. Basically, it is an awesome player that i love and enjoy. I prefer it over the ipod because it has a huge screen and little wasted space (unlike the ipods wasted surface area). I don't have many complaints other than one weird issue. Normally you can turn the device off and leave it alone for two weeks and it will still have the same battery as when you left it. Sometimes however, when you try to turn it on, the battery is mysteriously dead and you have to charge for a few minutes before it will even turn on. All in all, if I were in the market for a new mp3 player and had to choose between the zune 120 and the new 160gb ipod classic, i would still buy the zune because of its awesome features.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen is vibrant and detailed. Watching movies isn't painful, its actually enjoyable.. Love the nav system. To go up and down on a menu, swipe your finger up or down. If you swipe fast, it will scroll fast and then slow down.. Great sound quality.. 
Cons:. Not much, just nitpicky things.. Would prefer a universal usb connection over a proprietary connection.. Also it would be nice if you could make and save playlists on the go.. 
Summary:. The screen is great, vibrant and high resolution. The touchpad is great, i prefer this over the ipod's circular motion touchpad. This one you simply swipe your finger up and down to go up and down on the menu. It also has a fun feature to it, if you swipe your finger fast it will scroll fast at first, and then slowly slow to a stop. If you hold down in one direction, it will slowly speed up. When scrolling at high speeds, the first letter of the section you are in will appear on the side of the screen. The sound is great, that is if you have good sound quality songs and decent headphones. Seems durable so far. I've had it for 9 months and dropped a few times, so far no mishaps just a few scratches from the hard drops. One feature I wish this product had would be the ability to save on the go playlists. But, that is something I can live without. I also wish connection for charging and connecting to you computer was standard USB instead of a propriety connection.. OVERALL, HATS OFF TO MICROSOFT!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Interface. Navigation. Build Quality. Features (FM Radio, Podcasts, Games etc). 
Cons:. Game support is weak at the moment.. Software, though impressive, can act weird at times.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great interface, easy navigation, HUGE storage, FM radio, great battery life, price, just about everything. 
Cons:. No EQ, have to use either my computer or expensive add-on chargers to charge it.. 
Summary:. This is one device that pretty well does everything that I want. I don't miss a web browser, because I have my phone or PSP for that. But with the 120 GB I can pretty well store my entire CD and DVD library and have room left over. It now entertains me whenever or wherever I want. It's also small enough to be convenient. The only things I can find that I don't like is that there is no EQ function, and you either have to charge from your computer or Xbox 360 unless you want to shell out $30 each for the car charger or AC adapter. All in all, I would STRONGLY recommend this. All my coworkers want one now.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love my Zune, was skeptacle at first but after owning my 120G for almost a year, I can't find much wrong with it. For someone who makes long commutes and then plays hard on the weekend, it is great for all my needs.. 
Cons:. software at first had some issues although resolved itself for the most part with the last update.. 
Summary:. 120gb memory, everything you could really ever want in an mp3 player. I say, you can't go wrong!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic features such as big screens, wireless syncing and great sound quality. 
Cons:. battery life could be ebtter. 
Summary:. It�s worth the price - a must have for music lovers!. Updated. on Jul 24, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. The files are very compressed, so you can store a lot more music.. Very good sound quality.. Good video quality.. 
Cons:. Short battery life.. 
Summary:. GREATNESS+!. 

$$;
Pros:. UI, audio quality, fast scroll, games, large screen, user selectable wallpapers. 
Cons:. Tricky battery, no search function, premium earphones no longer available, glossy front, no EQ, exclusive PC software, US only in certain services. 
Summary:. An excellent music and video player, amazing for podcasts, gives another feelling for those who always see the omnipresent ipod right out there (Bolivian pal here). 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is huge, the built in radio is nice, and the wifi is better than the second generation, the 120 GB along with the 80 GB both come with the premium headphones again. Also the sound is amazing without the premium headphones.. 
Cons:. The glossy front is rather stupid. I preferred the old black zune. The better isn't the greatest. Since the zune isn't that popular yet there arent many companies willing to make accessories compatible with it.. 
Summary:. The Zune is the next big thing. It has one of the biggest screen, although the compromise is the battery. Since the screen is so big the battery is used faster, but it lasts longer than the iPod. In comparison to apple...there is none. Zune and Apple are two different leagues of MP3 Players. Even though the Zune isn't supported by many accessory companies, Microsoft itself has many accessories for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of gigabytes, nice design, subscription service offered, great interface. 
Cons:. No good earbuds, lack of colors, lack of accessories, software takes a long time to download and some things are not explained on their FAQ. 
Summary:. I have never owned an mp3 player in my life, but when I seriously began to look at the Zune and iPod I was impressed with the Zune. Not only do you get 120 gb for $249.99 compared to the iPod touch at 32 gb for $279.99+, you also get a user friendly interface. Microsoft has always prided itself on being user friendly for so-called computer dummies. I love that my Zune was plug and play. I have only used it so far for music and podcasts, but I'm very pleased.. What kept me from giving the Zune a 5 star rating was their software. It took forever to download and I have a very fast computer. Once I started the 2 week free Zune Pass which is their subscription service I had some questions that aren't answered on their FAQ. I can download albums to my Zune and take them mobile with me in the car, however, are they mine to keep on the Zune forever or do they have a digital expiration date? It might be because I'm brand new the to digital mp3 player world, but I'd love to find an answer to this. I might also not be utilizing the software correctly, but their subscription service doesn't offer a lot of artists when I go through their list of artists and albums that are available.. I love my Zune. I love how I am set apart from the iPod crowd. I can see a thiner design and more accessories in the 4th generation and I'm definitely looking forward to maintaining my loyalty to the Zune.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1) The easiest MP3 player I have ever used- menu navigation can't be beat, and the font size used on the menus is large and can be read with ease.. 2) Outstanding sound quality.. 3) The battery life isn't as bad as they say.. 4) Nice, large screen.. 
Cons:. 1) Even though the casing is beautiful and glossy, it scratches very, VERY easily.. 2) Sometimes overheats and must restart.. 3)The Zune Marketplace lacks movies and other features that makes iTunes ahead of the game.. 4) The Zune Pass isn't great.. 
Summary:. About two weeks after its purchase, I had become so flustered with my new iPod classic that I started looking into other MP3 players. I had heard of Microsoft's Zune a few times before ever considering to purchase it, and I had to admit that it was a fascinating product, and it quickly grabbed my interest. So, I returned to the store, gave up the iPod, and upon recieving the money from the iPod, I purchased the Zune 120GB (glossy black) (since the iPod and the Zune are the same price, it was easy to make the transition). I have rarely made a better choice. The Zune is truly wonderful.. Let's start with the pros:. 1) The Zune is extremely easy to use as far as menu navigation and such, and surprisingly enough, it pulls it off with style. The menus are sleek and powerful, and the font size used for them is legible.. 2) One of my main complaints about the iPod was the fact that it had horrid sound quality. There was no mid-range in the audio, it was either blaring, yada yada yada, too quiet, yada yada yada, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. (If you want to read more about the sound quality, go to my profile and read my full review on the iPod classic.) Although, with the Zune, no matter what song I choose, I can actually get killer sound quality. There actually is a mid-range in audio, it's not blaring when you don't want it to be, it's quiet when you want it to be, and so on and so forth. In a nutshell, the iPod's sound stunk, and the Zune's is wonderful.. 3) Even though the battery life could be a tad longer, it still has an impressive battery compared to others. It beat the iPod's battery life with ease, and if you're going on a long road trip, the Zune's battery should last you for quite some time. Good for traveling. Definitely.. 4) The large screen displays vivid colors and resolution, and although some video playback resolution isn't as great as the iPod's, it is still a brilliant choice for viewing album art and pictures.. Even though the Zune is probably the best MP3 player on the market, it does have its shortcomings. They are as follows:. 1) The casing for the Zune is beautiful and glossy... to an extent. I haven't ever seen the Zune 80 upclose and personal, but I can assure you that the Zune 120 scratches much more easily with its plastic exterior than the Zune 80 did, with its metal shell and aluminum backside. I would highly recommend getting a case for your Zune. It will help.. 2) At times, the Zune will have to restart if you get it confused or press too many buttons at once. If you leave it on for, like, five straight hours, it will overheat and have to restart. Although, this doesn't happen often, and it shouldn't hinder your choice in purchasing a Zune.. 3) Ok, this is the only thing that I think the iPod has over the Zune: service. iTunes is a wonderful service that offers multiple movies and TV shows to buy, and you can download almost any song known to man. The Zune Marketplace, however, lacks the ability to download movies, and also lacks many TV shows that are available on iTunes, such as one of my favorites: Family Guy. Also, the Marketplace doesn't have as many songs as iTunes supports, which is a let-down. Although, the Marketplace still has enough songs to keep up with iTunes, which is impressive enough.. 4) This is the only thing I cannot stand about the Zune: the Zune Pass subscription. The Pass will let you download as many songs as you want, but here's the catch: you can only keep ten of those songs a month. TEN. In an entire MONTH. ONLY TEN. A MONTH. It blows my mind. That's, like, RENTING MUSIC!! Who wants to RENT a song?! You rent movies, or games, but SONGS?! NO!! NO!! NO!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! I am currently not using the Pass, and I do not intend to start.. If you can grin and bear the Zune Marketplace and Zune Pass (which you don't have to use), then the Zune is a wonderful alternative to the iPod. The way I look at it goes like this: the Zune is a great device with less-than-desirable service, and the iPod classic is a less-than-desirable device with great service. I've come to embrace and accept the fact that the Zune Marketplace will never be iTunes, but I can rest assured that the iPod will never be the Zune as well.. 

$$;
Pros:. The sound quality sounds better than the ipod even with the headphones the zune comes with. The screen is really good for watching videos and podcasts and the screen really makes the album art look nice.. 
Cons:. The battery does not last as long as the ipod and there is not a lot of accessories for it.. 
Summary:. It good if your like to like to listen to high quality music and watch a lot of videos. Because the zune hold a lot more videos. And the wi-fi is good with the zune pass. I have one and I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent sound quality (not even comparable to the iPod). Loads of memory. Awesome glass screen. Nice Interface. Sturdy Build. Impressive FM Radio. Simple software. Great looks for a 120 GB mp3 player. 5 awesome games included in the software. 
Cons:. Battery life is only ok. No Zune Marketplace in Canada. 
Summary:. I think that this product is superior to the iPod Classic in so many ways. First off, I sold my iPod Touch to buy this Zune, I knew about the iPod Classic, but it didn't appeal to me, it's not that good of a product. It's a shame that Zune sales are abysmal, this is a gem of a media player. It's sound quality is amazing, my iPod Touch's sound quality is abysmal compared to the Zunes, at high volume the sound on the iPod is muffled, even though I use some decent phones (JBL Reference 410). With those same phones, the sound on the Zune is so clear and crisp, with great bass, I really don't need EQ settings like bass booster because it fits my type of music genre (Rap, Hip-Hop) without any complaints. Really, this is what I like most about the Zune, amazing sound quality, thats what most media players should focus more on (e.g., iPod), now listening to music is a much more satisfying experience. There is so much memory in this thing, there is no limit to the amount of stuff I can upload onto it. I adore the bright, scratchproof screen, simple easy to use interface and Zune pad. It`s build is great, nice and strong, but not heavy at all. The FM radio is great, with good reception. I really like the software for the Zune, it`s so open and simplistic, it`s easy to use. For a 120 GB mp3 player, it looks pretty slick, with that nice black casing with a glossy black front, it`s a functional looker, not quirky at all but not too serious looking too. And the 5 games that come with the software are a big plus, they are all good games, and I`m sure that more are coming. What I dont particularly like about the Zune is the battery life, but I can live with that, and it`s a shame that the Marketplace is not available in Canada, but I would rarely us it anyways. All in all, this is a great media player that is prefferable to the iPod Classic, it`s just better. The thing is, people buy iPod`s because of the name, and that`s why it is so sucessful, and why the Zune has horrific sales numbers. Still, any day would I rather have the Zune than the iPod, who cares about the name, Zunes are BETTER THAN IPODS, and that all it is, I adore my Zune, and so do the majority that buy them, and I can`t say that for the iPod Classic.. 

$$;
Pros:. For once, an OS (on the Zune that is) that you can recognize without getting confused, a WiFi setup like no other (excl. iPod touch), all around goodness without the hype.. 
Cons:. Hey Microsoft, ever heard of battery life? ZunePad can be glitchy (though rare), ZunePass could be a little cheaper (say a few bucks), Zune 4,8 and 16 could be smaller (though that could very well change), some iPod functionality would be nice.. 
Summary:. While there is no competition to the iPod touch, the latest line-up of Zune's make them worthy alternatives to Apple's iPod nano and Classic line, as well as SanDisk's Sansa line, one might even say it passes the Walkman as well. If you have Windows, and don't want all the hype of an mp3 player, plus you want some integration with your home wifi network, this is your mp3 player. However, sometime in the future of this device, I'd like to see improved battery life, slightly cheaper price on Zune Pass (say $12.99) and a slimmer profile for the SSD (solid-state drive) Zune's. No bash on Microsoft, but the OS on the Zune could be more Windows like, althought it goes in saying that it already looks (somewhat) like the guide menu in Windows Media Center, despite being made up of a chopped down version of Windows CE. Maybe some personal themes (color wise, font size and menu readout come to mind) would enhance it even more over the iPod lineup, especially since the Zune already has wallpaper customization. Hint, hint Microsoft. And lastly, pass up on the Zune if you wish for an alarm clock or any sort of note viewer as the Zune doesn't have them (though the iPod does), otherwise, this is an excellent mp3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is amazing the sound and radio follow. Everything about it is good except battery. which is just ok.. 
Cons:. battery and smudge finish are the only cons. the ONLY.. 
Summary:. EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS GREAT! Screen is awesome, and everything . THe battery is good for just music but videos not so much (movies) Unlimited space. Everything but battery and smudge is great!!!! GREAT DEVICE. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen is about 2x larger than the competition (iTouch not included as its a completely different product). Device software is very sleek and easy to navigate (No spinning like a chargeable flashlight). Such HIGH QUALITY video on an MP3 player for $220. 
Cons:. Zune computer software NEEDS an overhaul so its easier to organize and tag files. (I wish they would add WMP integration so you could use WMP to sinc and organize songs). With they would allow you to add 5-star rating on the device. No built in EQ. 
Summary:. The Zune blows its competition out of the water. For the batery life what the autor overlooks is the fact that the screen is almost 2x larger. watching movies in an iPod (other than the iTouch) is abysmal at best due to the tiny, eye-straining, screen. With the Zune you get a screen, movie worthy, that multiple people can view at once.. The built in radio tuner is great and is just one thing you get without buying an accessory like you have to do with the iPod. Wireless Sincing is GREAT(iPod's can't)\. Sharing songs over the built-in wireless is fun and is a great way to hear new songs without sharing the ear bud. One other major point the author makes is how its games and movies arent comparable to the iTouch. The iTouch is the same price but has 1/15th of the space. I have 23GB of video at half the resolution the iTouch supports and with only 8GB the iTouch is ruled out as a video player IMHO. The games however are better but if you want to play portable touch games of FUN quality BUY A FREAKING NINTENDO DS its what its made for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent GUI.. outstanding software (beats i tunes).. Subscription services rocks. 
Cons:. Subpart battery.. 
Summary:. A++++. 

$$;
Pros:. Full featured wireless, huge storage for tons of videos and music, large screen, track pad great for navigation and gaming, zune pass adds an incredible amount of functionality. 
Cons:. Inferior Battery life, small quirks such as no "on-the-go" play list creation, Zune Marketplace library not as large as iTunes, Mac users are SOL. 
Summary:. With the Zune, Microsoft has taken many variations on the standard iPod formula. The biggest of these variations are the included wireless features. Songs can now be previewed, bought and downloaded directly to your Zune through any open wireless network. This becomes especially useful when combined with Zune pass, allowing you to download tons of songs with out having to keep track of payments. You can also stream full songs with zune pass, meaning no more thirty second clips [But I digress, this review isn't supposed to about about the zune services]. Other wireless features include wireless sync through your home network, music sharing with your fellow zune cohorts, and a very nice FM radio tuner. Altogether the wireless features work well and add lots of functionality to the Zune.. In contrast to the iPod, the Zune's body is a little bigger, but the third generation zune is not the brick the first generation was, and is still capable of being stowed in most pockets. The screen is also bigger with a nice glass, scratch resistant screen that is great for video veiwing. The metal backing in the second generation zune is now a matte black, and the front has gone from a textured opaque black to a glossy black finish. Personally I like the texture look better, but it's really a small difference. Below the screen is the track pad, or-uh "Zune Pad" and a play/pause button and a back button. For most this setup requires some getting used to from the iPod scroll wheel, but it becomes just as instinctive as the scroll wheel with in a few days. The track pad also allows for more natural feeling games in comparison to the ipod, and makes for easier navigation. Along with the zune itself comes a usb sync/charge cord [no outlet power adapter] and some low end, but usable, head phones.. Software wise, I found the Zune market place program to be just as surprisingly full featured as the Zune itself. Most noticeably, the social option allows you to see what your zune market place using friends have been listening to and what the like the most. With zune pass you can stream their playlist and easily download what you life. You can even chat with your friends through messages or online comments. On top of the social features, Zune Market Place's mix view feature suggests artists you may like or fellow users you can befriend based on musical taste. It should also be mentioned, that for me, a reluctant Vista user, Zune Market Place runs beautifully, especially compared to itunes.. Overall, I find the Zune to be a much better MP3 player than it's adversary, the iPod. It comes with more user friendly features, void of the tyranny of the iTunes / iPod duo. Being a former iPod user, I'm ecstatic about my Zune. Even switching has been made easy thanks to a free 14 day free trial of Zune Pass, so I could just redownload music that I had to leave behind because of iTunes DRM. There are few draw backs to the Zune, and in is most fields it matches up and surpasses its competitor[s].. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent sound quality, wifi, big screen, software is easy to use, controls are awesome. 
Cons:. Video Battery life is just eh, a little slugish at times. 
Summary:. I've waited years for an MP3 player that was "perfect. And after having used creative zens, ipods, cowon, and a bunch of others I've finally found it-with Microsoft no less. The first thing you'll notice is the gourgous, glass covered screen. It beats the ipods hands down and is great for watching movies on. The audio quality is absolutely amazing, even with the lack of eq. everything sounds natural and deatailed . Get yourself a good pair of earbuds and this thing really shines. So baisicly, got $250? Need an Mp3 player? BUY THIS! You wont regret it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wireless syncing, music subscription availability, GREAT sound quality, large capacity, radio, great screen, larger screen than ipod classic, good music management software. Nice durable case easy navigation.. 
Cons:. Battery life could be a touch longer though not a big deal. Older models came with better earbuds also not a biggie. Not as many accessories although they are of better quality. Doesn't work with Mac software.. 
Summary:. Let me start by saying I had been an Ipod user. I owned a nano till the click wheel died and I replaced it with a 30gb classic which had served me well. I also had purchased my daughter 2 Nano's. NO LONGER. Ipod's are more popular but they are not as good as Zune's thus my recent purchase of a new 120GB model.. I have a larger screen and much greater capacity than in my 30gb and the price I paid for this 120GB was comparable to what the Ipod cost at the time. The Zune is much more sturdy while not bulky. It is built very well and has a large vibrant screen. The navigation buttons are very easy to navigate and work very well. Battery life is good but like any heavily used battery operated product we will always want more. I can watch 2 movies or listen for 2 days of heavy music play before the battery will die. But as stated that is listening almost every waking moment. In above average use I can get about 3-4 days without having to charge it.. One of the greatest things about my Zune for me is the music quality. The Ipod music quality just doesn't compare especially not for purchased music. The Ipod bitrates are skimpy @ 126Kbps and it shows in the quality of the music. I abandoned the Itunes store and have been buying my music from Amazon's Mp3 store for that reason. The higher bit rates of the Amazon store reveal subtle sounds that are not present in lower quality Itunes AAC downloads. While Mp3 is by no means a great audio codec it is widely used and available and of acceptable quality at higher bit rates. The ability to use WMA, WMA pro or lossless formats is a big deal for me. My car changer will recognize Mp3 but not WMA the WMA capability of my Zune gives me the opportunity to use the WMA format on my Zune and then plug my Zune into the line in, in the car. I paired my Zune with a pretty good set of collapsible Phillips headphones that use an over the head form factor with 40mm magnets. The sound quality is impressive even on a $40.00 headset.. On to video. The video performance on this is great with the large hard drive. I have Batman the dark knight, Ironman, Incredible Hulk, Stepbrothers, Star Wars (Clone Wars), Speed Racer, Tropic Thunder, Hellboy2 &#38; I am Legend on my device with all of my music and several video and audio podcasts and I still have 90GB free!. It is also very cool to have an FM radio. I didn't think I would use it but I have caught myself listening to some local news and weather over the air. This could be very important in the event of an emergency and you have it if you need it. Being able to tag songs to purchase later is also very cool.. A good friend of mine and I also both have Xbox 360's so we were able to use our current gamer tags when setting up our accounts and were recognized as friends as soon as our set up was complete. In the social portion I can see what he has been listening too as he can see what I have been listening to which is quite cool. We also were impressed to know that we could beam songs from device to device without a wifi connection which we thought we needed. My Zune now recognizes my home wifi network which is password protected whenever I need to do something like sync it or want to look at the marketplace from the device.. In summation after only a few days of usage I can't put this thing down it is truly addictive. I am now signed up for my trial of Zune Pass and will add my thoughts on that later but for right now believe me this is MUCH better than my previous Ipods. The classic Ipod is easily trumped by this device. The Ipod touch is a better competitor but it still loses out IMO based on the much smaller capacity the Touch's have and the inferior sound capability. Friends don't let Friends buy Ipods!!!.

$$;
Pros:. Channels (check out zune site), Screen size, Quality, Hard drive size, battery (better than my old ipod), marketplace access, Zune pass (keep 10 songs a month, as an MP3). 
Cons:. Software is almost there... the hold button feels cheap.. 
Summary:. Love the player software was the down fall, but it has improved allot. Zune pass and Channels are what I love, and now adding the 10 song credits a month with the pass make the service BETTER!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great looking player. Best interface on the market. Lots and lots of accessories.. The 80G version comes with some fantastic ear buds. 
Cons:. Requires additional software. Making multiple play lists requires that the player be connected to your PC. Not Mac compatible. The 120G version comes with some pretty cruddy earbuds. 
Summary:. Its hard to explain the appeal of Zune until you actually have one. Its the beautiful simplicity and ease of use. I didn't really come to this realization till my 80g Zune was stolen from my car a couple weeks ago.. I decided to replace it with an Archos 5. Which broke my heart when it died for no reason shortly after. So today I bough my second Zune, this time the 120G. It's syncing right now as I type this and I couldn't be happier.. 

$$;
Pros:. Microsoft, one of the greatest technologic companies ever just keeps improving there products every day, and the Zune 120GB proves it, with over all better quality then Apple.. 
Cons:. Even though Microsoft is kicking Apple's butt, Apple still has a few tricks up their sleaves with more battary power in there iPod Classic and its smaller, overall, the iPod wins in the inhanst technology department.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Video Quality, Easy to use, ZunePass, Great interface, etc. 
Cons:. Wished that Zune80's buttons were still on these, kinda feel cheap with glossy buttons. Zune software have minor errors here and there which are kinda easy to fix, yet time consuming, lack of color choice, not too many accessories. 
Summary:. Actually bought Ipod Touch, thought it would be a lot better than my brother's Zune80, but started hating it because Ipod touch just sucks without any wifi connection. Hated how it lacked actual buttons because I would have to take it out and flip through songs since touchscreen buttons just suck when u r not looking at the screen. I returned it because new Ipod lines were coming out and thought I should just get new Ipod, but instead ended up getting Zune120. Love all the features, I liked how it didn't come with earphone because I have Creative Aurvana earbuds, kinda sucks if I am paying for earphones that I will end up not using.. One thing that I love the most about Zune is the zunepass. 15 dollars a month isn't too bad considering it costs bout 99 cents per song these days. Love the Zune software's "picks" and "channels" because I can just plug in my zune before I go to sleep and I will have fresh batch of songs. I am constantly listening to new music and I like how I don't have to sit on comp browsing and picking songs one by one. ( Esp when I have classes from 6am-noon, work from 1pm-10pm everyday) Plus when I am driving, I know what buttons I am pressing so I can skip songs that I do not like without trying to focus on ipodtouch's touchscreen while driving.. I wished it had that same "matte" buttons that zune80 had. O! and There has been several errors when downloading songs on Zune software since 3.0 update. Something with DRM corruption. Had to look through Zune forum and fix which I did not know about for 2 wks of not being able to update. Even though I blame zune for it, I am glad that there are a lot of people on forum who are willing to help each other out.. I wish that there would be a lot more people with zune so I can social more since I see lot of ppl w/ ipod these days. I officially hate ipod now ever since I grabbed my own zune :P. 

$$;
Pros:. Same Zune as before, with mores space. Silent harddisk.. 
Cons:. We lost the Premium headphones :(. 
Summary:. If you want more details I wrote a detailed review on my blog.. http://bloguedegeek.net/2008/10/14/microsoft-zune-3g-120go-et-la-mise-a-jour-30-evaluation/. 

$$;
Pros:. Sound Quality, WiFi, Radio Feature. 
Cons:. Stupid Microsoft points system instead of just the pure currency to buy music. Confusing Zune desktop interface. No autocomplete like in iTunes, specifically if I type in artist or album info once, it should auto suggest next time I enter data.. 
Summary:. As a person who has owned a half dozen iPod and bought well over a thousand protected AAC songs on iTunes it was quite a investment for me to switch to the Zune. After two weeks, I can honestly say I do not see myself going back to the iPod again. The Zune is a quality music player with much better sound than the iPod, a bit ironic because the Zune doesn't even come with a built-in equalizer. The Zune pass is cool, but many songs aren't available so $14 could be kind of a rip-off if you can't listen to many songs you want to listen to. I also think they should have developed their music purchase tagging system around a WiFi radio solution instead of regular radio. To me if they included WiFi radio capability, specifically with Windows Media type channels - this application could have truly given iPod a run for its money. I live in a urban area where I get zero radio reception and would love to use the music tagging system to purchase songs but I can't. If Bill Gates ever reads my review I want to ask him "What is Up with the Stupid Microsoft points system to buy my music online?". 

$$;
Pros:. WiFi...make that USEFUL WifFi... very slick interface.... subscription baby... updating on the road with subscription... updating on your base charger... updating...updating...updating. 
Cons:. glossy face... EQ (sort of miss it... not tons because the sound quality is superb w/o.) Wish it was just a TAD bit smaller... not much though.. 
Summary:. BAM... this thing is KILLER. 120GB of music goodness with autoupdate capabilities. This is the one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Podcast support(yay!); large GLASS screen; compact enclosure; useful touch sensitive squircle; wireless syncing; FM radio; possible future game support. 
Cons:. Plastic scratch-prone front; no 240 gig 1.8 inch HD; No web surfing; No audio recording; no built-in speaker; limited controls. 
Summary:. The 3rd gen zune is great for watching videos and playing mp3s wirelessly synced from your comp, but still doesn't have all the features of a PSP. xD. 

$$;
Pros:. Great user interface, radio, big screen and finally games. 
Cons:. Doesn't have an auto shut off or alarm clock and can't browser the web. 
Summary:. Great MP3 player, better than the Ipod Classic. Also there is an equalizer in settings-music-equalizer.. 

$$;
Pros:. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. 
Cons:. none so far, except i don't know how to do this.. 
Summary:. SOMEONE HELP. PLEASEEE. I DONT KNOW HOW TO SET UP THE GAMES AND THE CLOCK AND THE MARKETPLACE. I HAVEN'T CONNECTED IT TO MY COMPUTER YET. IS THAT WHY?!?. 

$$;
Pros:. Downloading and streaming music over WIFI are great and works like it should. The new channels and mixview features in the software are usefull and i'm finding more music than ever before. Awesome features! The Msft Zune is coming together nicely.. 
Cons:. Battery life of the 2nd gen Zune are much better than the 1st but could still be better and Microsoft really need to start getting this device global. I live in Japan, and wierdly enough i'm seeing Zunes in trains over here. This is good I guess.. 
Summary:. Like i said earlier, the device and software ecosystem as i see alot of reviewers calling it is really coming together and fast. Now all you apple fan boys out there don't jump all over me for what i'm about to say. I thought the Zune was a better product than the Ipod (not including the Touch)after the 2.5 firmware update. Coupling the features of the 2.5 update with the all you can eat subscription service for a mere $14.95 a month(the cost of a CD) was just pinacle. Now with this latest update the player has become this sort of MP3 player on steriods. Wireless purchases and streaming of music, Buy from FM, A clock which might not seem like a big deal but its something Zune users have been asking for for a while so i see this as MSFT listening to their current base of zune owners, and the list goes on. For a full list of features see www.zune.net. There are loads of features and I am expecting more to come. What does Microsoft and the Zune team over there at Redmond have up there sleeves? Here are my predictions: More compatibility with the Xbox 360, Mediacenter and dare i say it, Cell Phones, which have been rumored all over the Kloud. Either a straight up Zunephone or incorporating the software into windows mobile devices. Only the future and those guys in Redmond no the future of Zune at the moment, but i expect in 2009 the Zune will be on steroids, ecstasy, and maybe ephedrine. My2cents!. Updated. on Oct 6, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, radio, games, clock, software update. 
Cons:. Battery life for videos, glossy. 
Summary:. I can't believe I got another Zune even when I already had my 4GB. But I thought it was worth a try.. So I got it and the first thing I noticed was how shiny and glossy it was. I really don't like things when they get smudged but thank god I learned how to get past that.. The audio quality is great and the earphones that come with it are decent.. Of course the screen is excellent. Pictures and videos look beautiful on this but it's sad that videos couldn't be watched too much.. I liked that they added games into the menu. I used to have to manually add the games feature but now it even comes with two games. I found myself killing the battery with this, too.. The thing I really liked was the clock since I used to have to use game applications as a clock. For me, the clock used to be the real setback.. Honestly, I will say that not much changed with the Zune software. It still looks pretty and I love it. It just shows your account in the right hand corner and I believe there are some other minor changes but I didn't really pay attention to that. ^^. Other than that, I'd say this is one of the greatest players out there. I always say "anything but an ipod" XD. 

$$;
Pros:. Audible support, games and marketplace improvements are all great adds. 
Cons:. can't believe the still haven't added a recently added filter list on the device, also wireless doesn't support all security functions and is not the easiest thing to set up. 
Summary:. i love my zune more then ever now with more things to do and more ways to show it off. as for the Ipod, SICK'EM ZUNE!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Bigger, better, and cant be itouched.. 
Cons:. with the wi-fi i wish you could surf the internet but i guess thats next.. 

$$;
Pros:. Mixview is fantastic, GAMES!, Good Value. 
Cons:. Horrible Headphones, Software can still be buggy at times. 
Summary:. I consider the Zune the little mp3 player that could. While the improvements over the 80gb were small they are very significant in terms of how people are going to be using this device. Without a Zune pass and some decent headphones I would give it 3 and a half to 4 stars but you need to be able to access Marketplace and channels to understand why Microsoft is providing good value for money. I know the ipod comparisons will be made but I think that is unfair.. Bottom line: If like me you love getting and purchasing new music, love watching videos on a portable device and have a windows computer, and willing to be different from the crowd,try out the Zune.. Apple makes great products that is why they dominate the mp3 player market, but I think right now the Zune is a great candidate for trying something new and I expect the 4th Generation to change the game.. 

$$;
Pros:. Subscription Service, great interface, SLICK software.. 
Cons:. No top end headphones, lack of color choice. 
Summary:. Bash MS if you must, but they seem to get it. I'm a professional musician and have waited patiently on the sidelines for a player/interface/program that allows you to discover music legally and without going into bankruptcy. Apple take note. No they won't slay the iDragon anytime soon, but if you like elegant design and outstanding functionality, go with the Zune.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has great sound quality as usual, and the screen is nice and large just what you need to watch a video. The wireless capabilities have been expanded with the zune 3.0 update.. 
Cons:. The battery is not that good especially for watching a lot of videos, the missing eq can be troublesome to a few listeners.... 
Summary:. It kicks Ipoooed's butt with the screen and wireless capabilities.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tons of storage, much bigger screen than competition, good user interface &#38; software, decent selection of peripheral equipment available. 
Cons:. NO EQUALIZER!!! (not sure how this happens on a $250 device intended for MUSIC),. not enough functions available on the player - many functions can only be performed using the computer software. 
Summary:. When you get up to the mass storage class of mp3 players, there isn't much to choose from - you're basically looking at either a Zune or an Ipod. I'm not crazy about the functionality of the Ipod, so that coupled with the Zune's much larger screen was the deciding factor. Also, for $250, I got the 120gb Zune and car kit, whereas the car kit for the Ipod was an extra $80. I'm really disappointed that there's no equalizer on this device - that was Microsoft's biggest mistake with this product. Fortunately, you can generally adjust the eq on whatever you plug the zune into (car, stereo, etc.), but it just doesn't make sense to have a product like this and not be able to adjust the eq.. 

$$;
Pros:. not yet reviewed. 
Cons:. not yet reviewed.

$$;
Pros:. Interface is good. Easy to use. Great sound. 
Cons:. More colour options needed.. 
Summary:. I like the interface of the Zune and I was amazed how easy it is to use. They need to give more colour options like I-pods.. 

$$;
Pros:. The interface looks good.. Not limited to using I-Tunes software. 
Cons:. Concerned about the battery life. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen. Large capacity. Decent sound quality. Zune pad is my favourite navigation method. 
Cons:. Battery life blows. A bit heavy and thick. Utilitarian looks. No drag and drop. Zune software is buggy and slow. 
Summary:. So it was boxing day and I had some money and I was looking for a high capacity player. I suppose if you're in the same boat the Zune 120 and the iPod Classic are your only choices.. I went into Futureshop to check them both out, and let me say I liked them both, but the Zunes' screen was just too beautiful and although I haven't tested this myself, the sound quality is supposedly better.. Also the Zune pad is amazing! It's responsive and completely intuitive, much like the click wheel but better.. The build quality is really good, it feels solid in the hand and nice to hold, the glass screen is a really nice touch, I do wish the resolution was as high as the Touch though.. The Zune software, sigh, is ok. It's slow and buggy but it's logical and well laid out, everything seems to be ok on that front. I miss being able to just drag and drop my music like on my old Walkman.. Speaking of Walkman, the sound quality is not nearly as good, but it is still good nonetheless, if only Sony made a high capacity player.... Oh and one thing people should be aware of, contrary to CNETs' review and the spec sheet for this player, the Zune does not support WMA Lossless. My entire CD collection is ripped into WMA Lossless and upon syncing, it converts to WMA, just like my old Walkman did. This really shocked me, it's your own product Microsoft! Duh!. Well on that negative note, the screen, supposedly better sound quality, and the Zune pad drew me away from the Classic. It's overall a better package. But you really can't go wrong with either. I hope this helps, have fun!. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks and feels great. Great video screen size. Easy to operate. Nice FM feature (if you use it). Cool graphics. Great games available. Lots of storage space. 
Cons:. NO EQ!! Sorely miss that feature. Zune software can be tempermental and hard to use. If unit freezes, there is no reset. Zune ear buds suck!! Buy a good set for yourself. 
Summary:. Overall,a good buy for a nice MP3 unit. Great sound if you get a good set of buds. Easy to use and operate. Music downloads can ber tricky with the ZUNE software Platform. If you want to download a few songs as opposed to a whole file, it can be most difficult. Cool graphics, nice features and good sound. Still beats the Ipod!. 

$$;
Pros:. Zune 3.0 firmware update, 120G of storage, dynamic Zune user community. 
Cons:. Not enough video content in Marketplace, mediocre battery life.. 
Summary:. What I love about the Zune are the dedicated people working on the "Social". Zune hired Rob GreenLee who is a respected figure in the podcasting community to build up podcast content in the marketplace. The Zune Social is where it is at though. Microsoft has hired professional djs, musicologists, and creative marketing types to build up the music social. The Zune Pass allows me to learn about different and new music I would not normally know if I had to go out and buy an album. I love how I can learn what cool music other Zune users are listening to and download the songs into my own Zune player. This aspect will get better as the Zune community grows. The new WiFi feature works great. If I'm thinking of a song that isn't in my collection I can walk into McDonalds or any WiFi hotspot and download the song instantly.. The Zune is an awesome podcatcher. I listen to all my podcasts on my Zune, and the Zune software helps me to manage this perfectly. I also like the ZuneInsider podcast which really helps me to feel connected with the product.. Being a Zune user, I actually feel as if I am part of a community. I actually get a lump in my throat when I see another Zune user. Do iPod users inspire such loyalty?. 

$$;
Pros:. Great for videos and music.. Solid built.. 
Cons:. Can't delete songs and videos directly from zune.. Doen't play AVI files without conversion.. 
Summary:. I love my Zune but it drives me crazy that I can't delete the songs and videos that I don't want anymore without hunting for them back home on the desktop application. I have a cheap Insignia and a Nexus 50 that are both cabable of this simple task. Why can't Microsoft include it? Can't be that hard. It would also be great if they would include basic web browsing and an e-mail reader like SONY PSP, the wifi is already there. On the next models a SD card slot would be a great feature, especially if it could be used to load and off load vids and music and load games.. 

$$;
Pros:. great menu, much easier to navigate and do what I want than any other mp3 player. 
Cons:. 1. no EQ. really. how lame is this.. 2. without zune software, PC cannot use it as a harddrive or otherwise see the device. Even with the software installed, user must edit the registry so that it shows up under my computer. 
Summary:. while not perfect, still the best harddrive based mp3/video player on the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. Straightforward easy to use software, I don't feel like I'm using a spreadsheet when I start it. The device itself has a great uncluttered UI and excellent audio fidelity.. 
Cons:. The zune pad can take some getting used to. Only average battery life.. 
Summary:. This is a player focused almost entirely on being a music player and it does this very very well. Eventually I expect MS to come out with an all in one device but focusing on the music is a great place for them to build their reputation in this market. One of the things I like most about it is the 'simplistic' Zune software. It does exactly what I want it to do and then it gets the hell out of my way. There is a lot to be said in favor of that.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface, much better than what I've seen from friends. Obviously the big screen is a bonus too. Other that, it's just a good mp3 player overall, as a general impression. 
Cons:. Syncing software can cause problems on your computer. At times frustrating. Proprietary dock, seriously the worst thing. File format compatibility is somewhat annoying.. 
Summary:. Good mp3 player overall, my primary motivation to buy it was that I was tired of the iPod, which exists in numerous concentration amongst my friends and family.. Overall I also liked it for memory capacity, which isn't unique to this product but still cool.. The whole look about it is cool too, I feel sad putting a case on it sometimes. 

$$;
Pros:. Wi-Fi. Radio tuner. The Zune Pass. User interface. Lower cost for massive storage capacity. 
Cons:. No EQ, excuse me!?!. Not the best battery life. No Mac compatible software, which I know will never happen..... :(. 
Summary:. I switched over to the Zune for one main reason. I was tired of buying ipods. After my 5th ipod in the past 6 years suddenly died on me, I was done. The Zune has a lot going for it and overall I am happy with my purchase. The Wi-Fi capability is awesome and having an FM tuner is definitely an added bonus. You also can't go wrong with the Zune Pass, which at 14.99 a month (unlimited song downloads, yes, the songs do get deleted from your Zune at the end of the month, however, you get to keep 10 songs permanently each month) essentially pays for itself. All the hardcore Zuners claim it has better sound quality than the ipod. I guess I have been to too many live shows, I can't really pick up a significant difference.. So, why 3.5 stars?? This bad boy does not have an Equalizer. This is a travesty. I thought an EQ was pretty much standard on any device that plays music. I read from a few online sources that Microsoft reported it did not include one in order to save battery life, ok, i guess. I also read a source that said Microsoft polled consumers and the results were that they felt an EQ was not necessary. I am not sure who they polled, but they need to poll people who listen to music next time.. The battery life is not the greatest, although certainly not a deal breaker.. One final note. It would be very nice if Microsoft made the Zune software Mac compatible. I know this would never happen, but Apple made A LOT of PC owners very happy by making the ipod, PC compatible (a move that also saved their company by the way). Come Microsoft, return the favor....... 

$$;
Pros:. The capacity is great, the sound quality is on par with the ipod.. 
Cons:. Prone to connection issues. I have had mine since xmas day 2008 and my laptop now does not recognise it. Tech Support does not answer the phone and microsoft says they have to alternative contact details... very frustrating and inadequte... 
Summary:. MICROSOF NEEDS TO DO BETTER IN TERMS OF TECH SUPPORT. 

$$;
Pros:. great design, wifi (marketplace), interface is slick &#38; easy, large capacity, feels great in hand/pocket/bag, material doesn't stain/scratch, no fingerprints!, can be used on Mac or Windows! (Parallels, VMware, Bootcamp anyone?), looks different!!!. 
Cons:. could stand to be a bit smaller and lighter, wish it could be used as a hard drive, wish my music didn't have to be stored on my hardrive (would like to use an external drive). 
Summary:. I love my Zune. I was one of the first to get the first gen and also one of the first to gen the second gen too. I think these are really great products. I'm even a mac user!! (thank you Parallels - I know both Apple and M-soft fanboys are out there dying right now). I thought the "squircle" would be weird when it first came out, but it's really cool. It's so easy to navigate between stuff, and if you want to scroll a long list, just hold it down. if you don't like the touch pad, you can turn it off too and use it like a regular 4-way button. One of my other favorite things is the customizable background, most players (ehm - ipod) won't let you do that. That was a must for me, I have to be able to customize. Also the bundled headphones were a surprise. My favorite pair I've ever owned. I absolutely love the cloth-covered wire, no tangles, no scratchy noises, and it fits in my ear rather comfortably (I even use them on my iPhone - shhh).. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Sound Quality, nice user interface, works on a Mac with Parallels, Works with Unprotected AAC files, the new back plate is less susceptible to scratches than the shiny stainless steel back of the iPod, great FM radio, Useful Wifi Features.. 
Cons:. Since it doesn't have a web browser for login screens - Wifi hotspots are limited, best wifi features require Zune pass subscription, very slow syncing, so so display, marketplace DRM is very restrictive.. 
Summary:. The Zune 120 is a good alternative to the iPod classic, it feels nice in your hand, the user interface is great and it sounds really great. The screen, although physically larger than the iPod classic, is still the same resolution making the display appear not as sharp as the iPod. Make sure and view them side by side before you purchase if the screen is important to you. If you like subscriptions, it's hard to beat Zune pass for what you get and iTunes doesn't even offer this. On the other hand, the amount of stuff crammed into the iTunes store can't be beat and if you have a thick wallet you'll be happier there. One huge thing that's missing from the Zune player itself is a playlist maker, similar to the Genius playlist maker on the iPod Classic, for a high capacity player it's a really nice feature.. 

$$;
Pros:. How did this happen???? Microsoft finely got something right!!!!. I like the subscription much more than paying for each song like iTunes. You pay once and don't wary how much you download! It is call freedom!. 
Cons:. 15 $ every month....180 every year! Neaah!. 
Summary:. Step in the good direction, much better than iTunes but still... expensive! If you buy 180 songs per year from iTunes it will cost the same as Zune subscription. If they have thousands songs...this is much better deal. I still don't see many people rushing to subscribe for something that they can still get for free!. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the interface both on the device and on the computer sync options can make it very conveinent. Nice screen and a fair amount of sorting and customization. 120GB insures that you wont run out of space anytime soon. Games are a nice addtion.. 
Cons:. Can not be used as an external Hard drive! had I known this i'd never have purchased the 120GB version as I know I don't have nearly enough video or music content to fill it.. No equalizer, this seems very basic that should have been included... 
Summary:. I figured I could move around large files as well as my music and videos with this thing but for whatever reason, reasons yet to be explained they have disabled using this device as a portable storage device. If I could I would go back and get a smaller sized model or a different brand one that allows me to store what I want on my own device. Don't get me wrong this is a great piece of hardware and good quality sound despite not having the option for an equalizer, however having the choice could only do the device good. The program sync is nice but sometimes I want to create my own folders and customize where I want the songs to be ordered rather it splits one album collection into 12 parts on my Zune and I't won't let me recombine them so im stuck scrolling through all 12 seperate folders to find a track. It's the inability to do what I want to do with my own device that earns it the rating it has.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is pretty much the same as the 80Gb. I do like that it has the FM tuner. It is great that the software allows other Zune users unlike Itunes.. 
Cons:. Anyone from CNet tested the skipping problem? I have Zune Home A/V Pack I've encountered skipping problems. It only happens when the Zune is docked on this. My software is updated. I've tried keeping the backlight on but the problem still persists.. 
Summary:. Am disappointed that the headphones that come with it is not really premium as listed on the box and of course the fact that Microsoft has not fixed the skipping problem. Just wondering how long my Zune will conk out? Please take note that my Zune that broke down has been used under normal conditions.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's big, pretty, bright.. 
Cons:. I think Microsoft has yet, again another software problem. There aren't many options to customize it.. 
Summary:. First of all, I don't like to have my music sorted by albums because I have hundreds of songs under the same artists and I don't remember which song is under which album. The only way to pick a song is to go my "Songs" tab and pick them out from there alphabetically. I wish I could go to my "Artists" tab and have all my songs listed from that artist there alphabetically.. Second, my clicking sticks. When I press the left button, instead I go up. When I press back, it's like pressing Ok.. I'm not too happy with it. It's okay, definitely like it better than the Ipod, but maybe I should've gone with the Archos for the price I paid for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. large spacious room, new improved software.. 
Cons:. no EQ, ditching the nice earphones.. 
Summary:. What is it with lack of EQ features in high end players? The EQ on the IPOD is pathetic and now the Zune no longer has one. It's unbelievable to me that a small cheap player like the sansa clip has excellent sound and an EQ that even makes it sound better, whereas the big boys of Apple and Microsoft decided that we aren't allowed to tweak our sound correctly. I'm just saying what gives?. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen is big, Wifi. 
Cons:. battery sucks. i hate how ths software on the computer is set up. 
Summary:. The screen is big, I like that, but at the end, it's actually not good. The picture/video quality sucks. It looks very pixeled out and my picture that i transferred in there looks distorted. The only picture that looks good are the ones already in there. Wifi is alright not all that impressive. There's not alot of Zune users I know of so I can't really swich songs with anyone:(. I really don't like how it takes forever (couple seconds to turn on or off) You have to wait for it to load when you turn it off or on, plus you have to hold two buttons down, which gets annoying. If you have it on for too long, it starts to "vibrate" like a PC would when you have it on for too long (i don't know the correct term). That also gets annoying, It's big and bulky, the case is so darn slippery! I dropped it over 10 ten, pretty high, and the earphones that came with it hurts alot! Volume isn't all that good. Only goes up to 20. I like my music very loud, and it can't really drown out the sound even when im using a pretty expensive earphone. During the time i had bought an Ipod 120GB along with my Black Zune 120GB also. Lets just say I wished didn't return my Ipod. Also, accessories for Ipods are so much cheaper than for Zunes. I have to keep the backlight for only 2 second, or else it drains my battery, On top of that everytime i go to change a song it drains my battery even faster. But if you keep the zune on the whole night, without touching the light and stuff, the batter will last 25 hours, ONLY if you don't touch the pad, keeping it on hold the whole 25 hours. When you charge it, don't forget to turn it on, or else it won't charge. The end: Unsatisfy with the product. Reviews weren't all that helpful..

Pros:. Great Capacity seeing I have 2100 CD's converted to put on the player. Desktop software Ok. 
Cons:. Awful player software just terrible. I have two Sansa players a 4 gb and an 8GB Fuze which put this Zune to shame when it comes to player software. If Sansa made a high capacity player I would have bought one in a heartbeat. 
Summary:. The player software is AWFUL. There is a real problem when it comes to reading the Meta Tags in any consistent manner. depending on the mode you are in. Album, Song, Genre etc. There is no consistency. If you are in album mode it will read the album title, but when you highlight the title sometimes it will read the artist name and sometimes it won't. (Believe me nothing wrong with my taggs) You find the same thing in different in different modes. And it goes on and on. Sometimes have to remove files from the player and collection and add them back in to fool the software.. The desktop software could be a lot better. I would have bought and I-Pod except I needed a large capacity player that played WMA's Overall a big disappointment. Hvae to be careful on how you sync the files. Basically the desktop software is counter intutitive. NO DRAG and DROP you are at the mercy of the Zune Software.

Pros:. This Product is perfect companion for me to store the music i download from this free unlimited music site http://topmp3.info. 
Cons:. You can even hear online music with this for free ;). 
Summary:. Just go and buy this sexy product guys.You can get songs download from the site i mentioned above :). 

$$;
Pros:. Sound quality is amazing, video is acceptable, user interface is easy to navigate and get accustomed to, radio and podcast service work well. Easy to connect to different computers and share libraries with Zune software.. 
Cons:. Zune software has slow startup for XP machines, no support for Windows XP 64 bit machines, library does not scan monitored folders on software startup, software library list is cumbersome and inefficient, no equalizer in player and sotware.. 
Summary:. Overall, the Zune player is good. It provides everything you could want in a high capacity mp3 player. Its main problems stem from the software used to sync up your music library with the Zune. I have not used the marketplace so I can't comment on its performance or functionality.. 

$$;
Pros:. WI-FI which accesses store and various features!. 
Cons:. VERRY INCONSISTANT ALL AROUND riping music, loading music, finding music in any form or fashion...ect.. 
Summary:. I'm not impressed at all for a so called heavy hitter mp3 player. It does get the job done but is a bit on the frustrating part for every aspect available. My 120gig unit was out of date right out of the box BOO It only finds about half of my music upon sync &#38; fudges the genera A LOT BOO Also syncing music fails A LOT again BOO All I can say is I'm getting by but DJ my own music and only got half of it on my zune BOO I'm pretty tech savvy and a co-worker said that's just the way it is BOO I feel let down majorly especially since my unit is blatantly old as of purchase March 27Th BOO I'm trendy but not the alternative trendy...hmmm I'm seriously second guessing my purchase.... 

$$;
Pros:. excellent audio. 
Cons:. Using sensitive Shure E530 headphones, terribly annoying hard drive audio noise easily perceptible between selections and during music. Difficulty in navigating through 120 GB of music. Returned this 120 GB for the 16 GB zune to avoid drive noise.. 
Summary:. For me, if not for the hard drive audio noise experienced with sensitve Shure E530's this would be an excellent mp3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not much good to say, it's deficient. 
Cons:. No equalizer, unacceptable. 
Summary:. Any company that builds an MP3 player without an equalizer really hasn't a clue. That would be microsoft..

Pros:. - Wireless sync. - Radio playback. - Ability to browse/play by genre. - Large screen. - Good audio. 
Cons:. - Highly inferior navigation. - Extremely poor PC software and library management. - Lack of customising options. - Poor battery life.. 
Summary:. I purchased the Zune 120 recently due to a failing battery on my Ipod Classic, and immediately regretted it. I was looking forward to the inbuilt radio and wireless sync, and while these features are nice, they can't begin to compensate for the Zune's failings.. Ergonomically, the Zune seems okay at first glance, but its 'navigation square' and its implementation are hopelessly inferior to the Ipod's wheel. Clicking or touching the exact centre of the square so that it interprets it as a selection and not a directional click is a matter of luck as much as practice. Simply searching your library is aggravating, with mouse acceleration-style simulated momentum causing you to hurtle straight past anything you're looking for. Considering the use of simulated momentum, it's ironic that navigation in the Zune is very slow -- far slower than that of the Ipod Classic. Much worse than the comparative sluggishness and difficulty of navigation, however, is the list display. The Zune arguably has one minor advantage over the Ipod Classic, in that it allows sorting and playing music by genre (this can be approximated with the use of smart playlists on the Ipod, but requires some pre-planning); this very minor boon is no subsitute for the frankly UNBELIEVABLE inability to see the names of artists while browsing the 'songs' list. Do you possess any cover versions of any song in your playlist? Have any of the artists in your list released a song with the same title as another song on your list? If so, you're going to have to individually edit all these song titles to reflect who the artist is, or else you're going to have to:. (a) click onto the individual subscreen of EVERY track which has the name you're after, until you find the correct one,. (b) actually play every one of these tracks until you find the correct one, or. (c) change over to the album list, navigate to the album of the particular track you're after, and identify and play it from there -- this is particularly aggravating if you've already spent time scrolling slowly through the alphabet to locate a song which you forgot had many duplicates.. For example, I have nine tracks on my Zune song list named 'Intro', and absolutely no way to differentiate them -- I must click on them one by one until I find the one I'm after, or go trekking through the albums or artist list to re-find the relevant track. Compare this to the Ipod Classic, which simply displays the track's artist alongside its title -- incredibly easy to implement, and it allows users to better identify duplicate titles at a glance. Unfortunately, neither the Ipod Classic nor the Zune list the ALBUM title by the song list entries (which would be useful for, say, live albums), but at least the Ipod provides SOME means of quick differentiation in its most obviously useful list -- the Zune provides none. This is absolutely inexcusable in a player with the capacity of a Zune 120. The Zune website boasts its ability to hold "up to 30 000 songs" -- do they seriously think that someone in possession of anything CLOSE to 30 000 songs will not have ANY song titles which appear more than once? Amazingly thoughtless design.. Okay, so you have to rename all your duplicate titles -- an unpleasant task for we neat-freaks who like our mp3s to have their correct names, but bearable, right? Unfortunately, although the Zune effectively forces you to do this, it throws up obstacles to doing so at the same time -- namely, the Zune's abysmal PC library software. You can't simply download artwork for an album -- rather, you must adopt their online database's entire ID record for those tracks, including album title, album artist, composer, year, etc -- if any of its broad swathe of changes are not to your liking (which is very likely, since it frequently provides INCORRECT or undesirable guesses) you will have to individually edit these tags back to whatever you preferred. Even this can mean trouble -- if you attempt to edit information about a song which doesn't have, say, a year tag, the Zune software will (seemingly at random) NOT ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE THE EDITING BOX until you have typed in a year. In the course of its mutilations, it has inexplicably rendered some of my songs unplayable in Itunes; its cavalier renaming of tracks has also led to completely wrong or inscrutable song titles, which I'm still in the process of relocating and repairing.. The Zune makes simple things complex, makes easy things difficult, makes right things wrong. In every way except its FM and wireless capability, it has been a step down for me. I've not owned any other comparable hard drive-based mp3 players, so I don't know if there are other options out there which beat both the Ipod Classic and the Zune 120, but I'll tell you this -- should a man ever come up to you in the street and offer you the choice of a double-priced Ipod Classic and a half-priced Zune 120... you should take the Ipod.. 

$$;
Pros:. Smart design of D-Pad. 
Cons:. Horrible interface of navigation. I could hardly find my way into this thing. It's horrible!. 
Summary:. You'll never get around with this at hand well maybe if you like the sluggish interface but other than that I'm out.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the screen and the overall look of the unit.. 
Cons:. The software interface, compared to iTunes is not as easy to use overall.. 
Summary:. I have a Zune and 2 iPods - a gen 3 and a 5th generation video. I find that the units compare in many ways but I do not like the software interface of the zune as much. From what I understand you have to have the "service" to benefit. What I notice is that when I search for music on iTunes I get a warehouse of choices at my fingertips. On the "Zuneware" I see an artist or a choice at a time. The experience to me seems limiting. I understand that in the reviews they speak of a better experience with a subscription but to me, part of the comparison is the software and working with the device out of the box. Why should I pay for a subscription ahead of time to view items? Even if I can use the subscription towards purchase, I do not want to pay for services that LOCK me into something I may not benefit from. iTunes still gets my vote. I got the Zune as a gift.. 

$$;
Pros:. large capacity and quality sound. 
Cons:. from what I have heard, Zune is not mac compatible. 
Summary:. If you cannot connect to both Macs and PC's then this is pretty much useless for every single person I know. Finding reliable definitive information on the internet about compatibility is not easy. I cannot even find the information here on CNET. CNET does have this article : http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-12519_7-10354727-49.html. However, this does not make universal connectivity in any way. I can plug an ipod into virtually any computer and it works, Zune doesn't.. 

$$;
Pros:. It holds alot of music. I've got over 40 hours of music and I've barely scratched the surface of what it can hold. The games are fun. 
Cons:. Breaks alot and very poor customer service. 
Summary:. I got my Zune in December, by March it had roken. Not through anything I had done, but because of a manufactuers flaw. I sent it in to be fixed and didn't get it back until June. All they"d done was give me a new one. 2 months later it was broken again, again their fault. when I called about it they told me they couldn't refund my money because i was ONLY the second time it had broken. It's been broken more than i"ve played it and their ccustomer service people are rude and incapable of helping and it takes months to get your player back. P.S. it's still not back and they were just supposed to send a new one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing really stands out with this product. Its below average at best. Software is better then itunes but not much better. Look and feel of the interface is unappealing.. 
Cons:. Expect about 3 to 4 hours of play time only and if you charge the device and leave it for two days without using it, it will be dead when you go to use it. I have had three replacements of my original Zune ALL WITH THE SAME ISSUE.. 
Summary:. I wanted this to work so bad because I HATE APPLE and did not want to use I tunes. Once I purchased my zune every time I used it the Battery died. I finally had to go back to my Ipod. Im going to try the creative next.. Updated. on Feb 15, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. As far as design they put a lot of effort into making it look good.. 
Cons:. Don't like the interface and software.. 
Summary:. Microsoft is just trying too hard and fumbling all the way. Zune will one day be a distant memory of what was just like the Atari. You know it existed but you've never seen one. Music managing software sucks compare to itunes. Over all just stick with what works .... just get an iPod. No software bugs like Zunes big 08 crash.. 

$$;
Pros:. NICE BIG 3'' BRIGHT LCD, EASY TO USE, I COULD WATCH MY PICTURES OF THE GRAND KIDS AND LISTEN TO MY MUSIC AT THE SAME TIME.. 
Cons:. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IT WENT DEAD, (AND SENT BACK FOR REPAIR) VERY POOR SURPORT. IT WAS A NICE XMASS PRESENT. IT IS GIVING CODES (COOD 124 9 ) THE FIRST ONE I SENT BACK. THIS TIME THE CODE IS (COOD124 F). I HAD ONLY USED ABOUT 20gigs .. 
Summary:. IF I COULD KEEP IT WORKING I WOULD RATE IT A 5.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works, it works really well and plays radio stations. 
Cons:. Zune Customer service and the device's constant freezing.. 
Summary:. I bought the Zune 80g March 2008 ($249) and since then have had to get it serviced four times. The main customer service issue is their tech support offers no resolution to problems other than having it sent back to their tech support and replaced. It takes almost 3 weeks to get your Zune back. They used to ground ship you an empty box (about a week to received the box), then ground ship it to Texas (another week) and then they ground ship it back to you (almost another week). That was the issue with the first three replacements I needed and the last was the worst and final time I put myself through the drama and stress of dealing with them. They revised their process by emailing me a UPS label which saved a lot of time from their previous method. BUT when I sent them my Zune to a UPS center in Texas it took them over a week to pick it up. Yes, they wait until a certain number of repairs are received at the UPS service center to pick up the entire batch. I kept checking this status page and it showed as being received in TX for over a week and Zune support did absolutely NOTHING to pick up player. So they couldn't give me any estimated time when I could receive my zune back. This final repair was beyond my warranty so they were charging me $195 for an upgrade. This process was beyond delayed for just a replace, not even a repair. That is when I decided I will not continue to be pushed around my Microsoft Zune and I wanted a total refund for my $190 and I will NEVER buy another Zune product for the rest of my life. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced and Microsoft should be absolutely ashamed for treating a customer like this. Save yourselves the grief and just buy an iPod.. 

$$;
Pros:. The device itself is easy-to-use, pictures look great on the giant glass screen, lots of memory for the money. That's about it.. 
Cons:. Everything else - battery life is atrocious (I was getting only 5 hours on a charge), the Zune software is minimalistic and cumbersome, non-functioning wireless syncing, lack of a graphic equalizer, digital copies of movies aren't supported by Zune. 
Summary:. I had the misfortune of buying a Zune over the holidays and, after going through 2 of them, returned the second one for a 120 GB IPod Classic. The biggest issue for me was the battery life. Microsoft claims 20 hours of battery life on a single charge, but I was getting only 5 hours on a single charge and I'm a fairly light user - just at the gym (3-4 hours a week) and during lunch breaks at work. Yes - I disabled the wireless feature, had the backlight set for only 15 seconds and used the button lock. When you go to the Zune Support page, there is a complicated, multi-step procedure for "recalibrating" the battery. Electronics should work PERFECTLY right out of the box. I actually returned the first one after owning it for 3 weeks because I thought it had a bad battery. When the second one performed in exactly the same manner, it went back after only a week. Unless you want to be tethered to an extension cord, don't plan on using a Zune for any extended period of time. In doing research on the battery issue, I found out that the recommended way of powering down the device causes a major power drain by actually placing it in a "standby" mode. A post in the user forum talked about a "secret" way of powering the Zune all of the way down to prevent further power loss. "Secret" methods for using and manipulating a device? No, thanks.. I never could get the wireless sync to work, either, and I consider myself to be pretty smart. The Zune never could interface with my wireless laptop, despite changing all of my security settings to allow it to do so. Don't plan on transferring any digital copies of movies to the Zune, either. Despite being transferred using Microsoft software, a Microsoft Zune doesn't recognize the format. Oh, sure - you can BUY content through the Marketplace, but any digital copies of DVD's you already might have on your computer won't transfer to the Zune. In my opinion, content within a Microsoft program should interface seamlessly with a Microsoft product.. The Zune software is counterintuitive and cumbersome to use. This one is hard to explain - you just have to play with it to see what I'm talking about. It's never really clear how to do certain things, like deleting content from the player, without going to the Zune homepage and digging through either Microsoft's instructions or user-posted forum content. No thanks - if it's not obvious from the software how to do certain things, this is probably the wrong product to buy.. The lack of a graphic equalizer is a major annoyance. I'm pretty picky when it comes to sound quality and I thought the standard settings were so-so. I didn't even open the package for the reportedly sub-par earphones that came with it, so I can't comment on those. I was using some headphones I already had and liked.. In terms of the good stuff, the hard drive is giant for the price. Pictures look great on the huge glass screen and the Zune pad works pretty well. But, given all of the negative stuff associated with my experience with the Zune, there's no way I'd ever own another one or recommend one to a friend. I knew that there had to be a reason why there are so many IPods out there. Now, I know why..
