Pros:. great sound quality-pure and balanced, class-leading screen, great looking video and great pictures, supports xvid and divx formats for video and aac (m4a) for audio, sd card support for memory upgrade,drag and drop option, supports "play-for-sure". 
Cons:. buttons are bit unresponsive sometimes.. 
Summary:. I always listen to music with this device day and night. Videos in 2.5" screen look great ( I usually watch long hours of movies in xvid format). Pictures can be used as background (wallpaper) while playing back tracks and It feels like an album art , a rare feature. It also has six different colorful themes. Pocketable mp3 player that excels almost every aspect without breaking the bank. Its a feat for this price range. I can recommend.. Updated. on Jun 12, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. My favorite features are the low price, the size, and the fact that you are not tied to any particular software suite like you are with the Ipod and Zune.. 
Cons:. Doesn't support the newer WMA Pro codec. 
Summary:. This is my second Creative MP3 player. I had the MicroPhoto. My favorite feature is that you're not limited to having to use proprietary software to use my MP3 player like you do with the Zune and the Ipod. This is the main reason I sold my 1st Generation Zune. I love the fact that I can use Creative's software, Windows Media Player, or just plug it in and utilize it like an external hard drive! It's been great to back up data in a pinch.. 

$$;
Pros:. beautiful 2.5'' screen, SD card slot, memory, file support, voice recorder, slim, affordable. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. Bottom line, it's the best player I've bought so far.. I mean, I just bought it because I love Creative, but I have to say, this is the best player by far.. I loved their Vision:M although it was my friend's, I just kept playing with it. But this tops it.. They kept the large 2.5'' screen which is absolutely beautiful. Pictures and movies look terrific on this screen. I'm glad they kept the screen size and put it into this very small and slim player, it makes it more pocket-friendly.. As expected from Creative, it has an array of features. It also supports AAC now, but I don't have those so I didn't really need it, but I know most people do. It supports many types of files which is great since you don't have to convert every single file into one file type. I've never had a problem with the program it comes with since it's pretty easy to use.. And something new from Creative, the SD card slot. I've never used those before, but they've proved to be quite handy for extra memory....not that 16GB isn't enough for me. I'm good with even just 4 or 8GB but just in case. I do watch a lot of anime shows so it was perfect for viewing those.. Oh and it has great battery life. One charge and I was listening and watching for two days. GREAT.. It is pretty affordable when you think about all the things that the player comes with and all its capabilities. I mean, I got this from Circuit City for about $170 (more or less) and that's really good for a 16GB player with this many features.. So I highly highly highly HIGHLY recommend this. I don't know how much I can stress it but it's absolute genius. I mean, unless you hate the controls, which I thought were good and pretty straightforward. I don't expect touch control or anything like that. Just easy-to-use tactile buttons.. SO GET THIS. NOW. XDDD. 

$$;
Pros:. small, sd card, exellent screen, good price. 
Cons:. the sd dosen't intergrate well. 
Summary:. all in all there is only one justified complaint which is that the SD card dose not integrate well otherwise this finally our cure to the ipod epidemic. 

$$;
Pros:. Own the 32gb unit. Excellent player. What I've been waiting for.. 
Cons:. Don't care for the grossy finger print magnet finish,. 
Summary:. Got the brand new 32gb unit about a month ago. Glad it's that big. Haven't had any of the problems that some users have had. Been using players of various types for years, so it's not like I don't know what I'm talking about. Haven't had a need to update the firmware anyway. I like to use the base memory for mp3's and the sd slot for videos so I don't have an issue with library integration. No white screen of death, lock-ups or detectable gaps in playback. Ditch the creative earbuds and get a decent pair of cans, honestly! For all the haters and pod fanboys, stick with what you want and leave the quality players with us.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light, thin, beautiful colors, sounds great, memory expansion, voice recorder, quality extra functions. 
Cons:. cant transfer media from exantion card to player, and other things?. 
Summary:. I have owned this product for a few weeks now. I love it, it sounds amazing, looks great, and is thin and light. There is very few things that I don't like about this product. I was looking for a player that came with more than 8 gigs of memory and I didn't want to spend 400 bucks on a touch. The headphones are not as good as the ones that came with the zen M, but they are better than the ones I bought from Phillips. I gave it a ten because I believe that its the best product out there and for a great price too. I'm a very conscious shopper and after reviewing all the product out in the MP3 market the zen was the best choice. If you don't believe me buy it, try it out for a week and if you don't like it just get your money back from best buy or fry's or where ever you buy your products from. Truly a great player. I recommend that you buy the skin with wire management comes in handy and work well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of features. 
Cons:. I don't know. 
Summary:. I have never used this but I have other Creative MP3 players (Zen Touch and Nano+) and I like them better than the iPod which I also own. I posted this with a 10 rating in an attempt to cancel out those previous 2 low ratings by people who also have not used it.. 

$$;
Pros:. supports multitudes of formats, big screen credit card sized mp3 player.. 
Cons:. skimps on bundled software. 
Summary:. definitely an ipod killer. 

$$;
Pros:. I loved the size; a little bigger than a credit card. The display was awesome; you could select different background colors to suit your mood. The SD card slot. The interface was good. I loved that I didn't have to use iTunes.. 
Cons:. But, I hated the fact that I couldn't shuffle all songs randomly. My iPod does this, and with 4000 songs, it's like listening to my own private radio station with the coolest DJ on the planet. I use this function a lot. I returned it for another ipod. 
Summary:. Wonderful player built by a respected, well known company. If you can live without the shuffle all songs feature, go for it...you won't regret it. In fairness, Creative may have added this feature to subsequent models, which would definately tempt me back to buy one at sometime in the near future.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface. Pretty neat looking. Decent menu customization options. Supports AAC, and works as a portable memory. Has FM radio unlike ipod.. 
Cons:. If you have more than 10-15 albums or artists per each alphabet, the navigation by alphabets would get boring. A decent player for upto 8Gb. Hard to navigate huge collections without touch navigation.. 
Summary:. Quite a capable player. For its size and appearance, it is very compact and sleek. Has FM radio, notepad (to read .txt files), outlook sync'ing, photos, videos .. what not!!. Screen (2.5 inch same as IPod nano) is pretty bright and works for me. For the price you buy this for, i think this is an amazing catch. Please do not expect a big screen from an inexpensive flash drive player. I was able to watch a complete season of my favorite tv show during my office commutes. I am very impressed with the player. Browse by alphabet and search by key word is a very handy feature (particularly since this lacks special scroll features).. The video converter software provided is rather slow. Get the iriverter software available for free which comes for the iriver player. Select the output file to be compatible with Zen Vision M. Iriverter does the job much faster than anything else i tried.. Buy one of those Silicone cases and screen cover (Zen Vision M screen cover works with this) if you are worried about getting scratches on your player.. No big complaints. I recommend this product over ipod nano (Considering the FM as a big plus in Gyms during your work out).. 

$$;
Pros:. nice design, good sound quality, brilliant screen/video quality,good battery. 
Cons:. screen flickers a small bit,computer software isn't great. 
Summary:. I absolutely love this player. Its really easy to use,it looks great and the buttons press down easily (as opposed to the zen stone I've had in the past). The sound is really good but the video and screen quality and video blew me away. The battery lasts for ages.. The screen does seem to flicker sometimes on my player, but its a very small problem.. I don't really like the zen media explorer that came on the disk, its a like drag and drop but doesn't let you do as much.. Overall I think the pros greatly outweigh the cons, and it was only 150 euro aswell, which is insanely cheap for a 16gb player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, expandable memory, excellent sound quality. 
Cons:. Battery life for video is a little short, doesnt play doom.. 
Summary:. This thing can do everything!!!!!!!!!!! If only it was free.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek, slim design; great battery life; same Creative easy to use interface; fantastic sound quality. 
Cons:. No backlit buttons like on the Zen Vision:M. 
Summary:. I've owned two iPods and they both **** out after just over a year of owning them. Then I moved to the Creative Zen Vision:M and loved it. While it was a tad on the bulky side, it had better battery life, better resolution, a cooler interface, and a more intuitive navigation system than the tedious and gerbil feel of the click-wheel. I dropped it several times and it still worked like a charm. When this came out, I had to have it. Creative has tweaked the interface to make it a little smoother and adds some small effects like the way the bar moves between selections. It sounds fantasitc, as is expected from a company that makes sound cards, has excellent EQ options, has the useful shortcut button, and the switch to tactile navigation buttons are a plus. Its a fantastic MP3 player that also plays AAC files.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound, slick interface, vibrant screen, and the DJ feature is really nice.. 
Cons:. Had an occasional freeze up before latest firmware. Creative has very poor linux support. Does not support all AAC files, only those with headers that it recognizes.. 
Summary:. I was blown away by the sound. It left my nano in the dust without even adjusting the EQ. The interface is very slick. I like being able to rate tracks on the fly. The DJ feature also lets you play the highest rated, least heard, not rated, shuffle all, or most heard tracks.. The few freezes that I had were do to some incompatible audio formats (m4a tracks ripped from CDs in Winamp rather than iTunes). A firmware update was released that fixed the freezing and most of the format issues, but not all.. I was slightly disappointed that the video has to be transcoded to wmv for it to play (no native divx support).. Lastly, Creative's linux support is abysmal. The player works in Ubuntu 8.04 to sync, but Creative supplies no software for linux (even firmware upgrade programs require windows).. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Sound quality, Customize menu order, create your own playlist. 
Cons:. Video playback a nuissance, scratches easily, battery life strange but long. 
Summary:. I looked all around for a detailed review for this mp3 player, but didnt find much, so I hope this helps everyone.. This is my 4th mp3 player since 2000. This is one of the best, I love how small it is and how functional it is. I have used the Creative ZEN M for 2 years and that is very similar to this one in many ways. I use it everyday going to work or wherever and it has never failed me. I use it for the mp3, radio and sometimes the video, hardly for pictures.. Sound quality is great, always use the EQ. I do not use the volume restriction or Bass boost as it just distorts the music. Set your EQ and you will be happy. I also love the menu customization as you can change the order and decide what belongs and what goes on the main menu.. I like how you can create your own playlists from scratch on the player it self. Then saving it as a playlist.. The video feature kinda sucks, you need a converter for screen size and codec. The creative zen m you did not need to do this, this is why I dont use this feature as much as I dont have the time or best program to convert videos.. Radio doesnt seem to have the BEST reception, but if you can find the station without using the AUTOSCAN it works good. You cannot record radio as you could in the past Creative zen M.. It also has a microphone built in to record whatever you want, concerts are not recommended as its too loud and too messy. Voices are probably the best bet for recording.. The coolest part is the SD CARD function. I do not use it for extra memory, but I do use it for reading SDHC cards as an external drive. You can transfer files from the card to the zen OR directly from the PC to the CARD using the ZEN as a CARD READER. I found this really helpful because there are not alot of SDHC card readers, just normal SD CARDS. You can also transfer all the memory from an SD card to the zen and then clear the SD card to continue using it on a vacation or somewhere else when it becomes full.. OVERALL I am very happy with it and glad I got it at a good price $160 plus tax.. I recommend it for those who want a good MP3 player with lots of functions. Video works good if you find a good video converter and good videos to convert from.. GO BUY IT!. 

$$;
Pros:. UI, support formats, video, FM...... 
Cons:. Not enough cool factors. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen quality. 
Cons:. The smudgy finish. 
Summary:. I've owned quite a few mp3 players over the years and this, by far, is my favorite. I would have given this a 10/10 except for one minor problem. It seems to hang up when trying to transfer very large amounts of data. Personally, I'm not that impatient that I can't transfer in two shots instead of one. No biggie, at least to me. This very minor annoyance is a very small price to pay for the quality. When I'm watching videos on my player in public, folks will walk up and ask me what this is..and want to go run out and get one. Picture quality is impressive and the sound...I upgraded to a pair of JVC earbuds...is AWESOME. Best player I've owned! Buy it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear screen with custimizable background, shortcut button which gives a lot of extra features, easy to navigate user interface.. 
Cons:. loud buttons that can be heard accross the room. 
Summary:. I just got the Creative Zen (8 gigs) about a week ago and couldn't be happier. The only real problem that I have with this player are the loud buttons. I'm in high school, and also in the middle of exams, so when I am done with my exam and want to listen to my music, it seems that everyone can hear me every time a button is pressed. However, this is a drawback that should not persuade anyone against, really.. also, i prefer this over a cheap-fealing set of buttons any day!. besides this one minor draw-back, the player works PHENOMENALLY. I hooked it up to my computer running Windows Vista (without loading the CD), and it instantly loaded ALL of my music in no time, and even my pictures and videos!. With that in mind, i give this player a 10/10 because of it's easy navigation, beutifule screen, great sound quality, and fast transfer speeds.. 

$$;
Pros:. Player offers more intuitive/user friendly features and customization options than you can shake a stick at.. 
Cons:. Player initially appears fragile. I intend to use it to work out with, but find myself pampering it almost. 
Summary:. I am now a Creative Customer in part to this player. I love the ability to drag and drop media without the cumbersome and many times damaging proprietary software you find with some other players. I don't have to speak to the display as it's already been stated that its excellent. Big ups to Creative on giving the customers what they want.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear Sound, Lightweight, Easy to Use. 
Cons:. Video transcoding required, Bass boost makes the sound muddy. 
Summary:. It's a great little player. Sound is clear (just don't turn on bass boost). It sounds great with the eg and all the audio enhancements turned off.. No more WSOD with new releases.. Updated. on Feb 18, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice big bright screen, SD Card Slot, FM Radio.. 
Cons:. Buttons could feel better, lack of available accessories. 
Summary:. Great mp3 player. I agonized over this for months. I am glad I got it. The best part is you can upload/download music from ANY computer. No itunes authorization, etc. SD card slot works great. I store movies on there as not to eat up all my on board memory. I wish the buttons were a bit more solid feeling, but not that big of deal. FM radio works very well. Stations come in very clear. Screen is amazing. Pictures look so nice.. I only wish it had video playlists.. I am happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent audio, video easy to use. 
Cons:. I have a little bit of trouble moving my music due to software. 
Summary:. I upgraded from my Jukebox Xtra to the 32GB ZEN. I haven't had any major problems. The knobs are small and take a little time to get used to, but are very easy to use. Also, I am having some trouble w/my creative media center transferring files quickly from the Jukebox - but this isn't the player's issue. I might need to reload my old software.I wanted a small player that can fit all of my music and this player does the job. The only other flash player I know of that has this much space is the IPOD Touch -but it is almost double the price and is bigger. I don't really care about touch screen technology or wi fi stuff so the ZEN is perfect for my needs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just About Everything. 
Cons:. Nothing Significant. 
Summary:. Love this player. I've had this player for months with updated firmware and all, and I particularly like that you can sync it with WMP. ZenCast is a great podcast aggrigator, the controls are nice (don't know why people say it feels cheap), screen is vibrant, sexy as anything, the back feels great (has a fine, grained texture to it, adds good amount of weight and feel to the player), and everytime I use the radio I think of what I would be missing if I had bought an iPod. The only caviots I can find are that it doesn't come with so much as a felt case, and the front of the player attracts fingerprints and scratches. Keep it in a nice case, and you'll never have a problem (I'm keeping it in the case that my digital tuner came in until my case from i-nique comes in). Great job, creative!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound, screen, functions, battery life.. 
Cons:. Software package just OK, SD Expansion flawed.. 
Summary:. As someone who's owned many DAPs, this is pretty much the closest thing to the perfect player I've ever owned. Easy to use, great sound, lots of functions and best all, expandibility (although somewhat flawed and needs work).. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, Brilliant screen, Superb audio quality, interface/extensive features. 
Cons:. Bundled software mediocre, screen smudges easily. 
Summary:. The Creative Zen is the best mp3 player I've owned. (yes, I prefer it to my iPod)It's compact, has an amazing screen for videos, (try Amazon Unbox)and a generous 16 GB of flash memory (or check out the 32GB flavor.. It's also not tied down to any software, and you can make/name playlists on the go. You can also browse by album art, listen to FM radio (good reception), and transfer photos right of of an SD card.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its Pretty rugged, The controls feel nicer than I expected.. 
Cons:. None So Far.. 
Summary:. I got my creative Zen at the creative website and would advise others to do so too, but I Also advise to go to Your local electronics store and try it out and look at it before you buy it online. I have a vista so when I got the package ,the software didn't work,so i got a update on the creative website and it works good now. Also I got mine in Sep. 2007 so it had just came out. The Creative Zen 4GB is what i bought because Of the SD card slot , on the slot there is no door to close over the card. The controls feel very nice and natrual to use,the screen is bright, the battery life is awesome and the interface is great. Being able to use itunes songs is great too. Note when in the sun it is almost impossible to see screen but the sound is awesome on this and the video is very,very good although i did notice some pixelation. the FM tuner gets OK reception but not great. Overall i think this is probebley the best player I have ever had.. 

$$;
Pros:. fantastic works great has great sound and beautiful display. 
Cons:. scratches easily not too many accessories. 
Summary:. the prices have dropped to 2gb-$80 4gb- $110 8gb- $150 16gb- $200 and 32gb- $350. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, Expandable memory, Great sound quality, and crystal clear video quality. 
Cons:. Finger print magnet, no back- lit controls. no integration with SD cards. also, the cable in the box is too short.. 
Summary:. I have owned the Zen vision: M (also a great player), and after that was stolen i bought a Zen V Plus 4 GB(amazing for the price if you don't have a lot of music). This player is wonderful and improves on both models in many aspects.. I have come to expect a high quality of sound and this player doesn't let me down. the EQ function makes music that much better.. The screen is crystal clear and pictures and video are a dream.. The fact that the player has an expandable memory slot is the reason why i bought it, even after being told the cards don't show up in the music library. I put all of my videos on SD cards and it functions similar to your dvd player. Want to watch kill bill, put in one card. want to watch your complete season 3 of nip/tuck, switch to a different card. Nifty in its own right.. now for my minute problems. I really wish they had made the controls back-lit. in a sense you have some trouble distinguishing between the play and the shortcut key in the dark. With my new case with wire management, the buttons are raised so i no longer have as much of an issue.. Ok, so i have neevr really like the radio. i assume its my town, i don't get great reception. but if i wanted the radio, i have a car. doesn't bother me. but its a problem none the less.. Being black, it picks up smudges like no one's business. I keep a cloth in the case. quick wipe and its good. buy a case though, it is a must.. The memory card doesn't integrate with the library. Many people are up in arms about this, but its not a huge hassle. I downloaded the firmware update for free from the creative site and it now allows me to integrate the pictures. With time no doubt they will do the same for music and videos.. The mini usb cable that comes with the player is far too short, probably about 3-4 inches in total. i use a USB extender when i want to transfer anything to the player. i suggest you buy the same if you don't have a long distance to travel from the player to your USB port.. Overall, the player does what its suppsoed to, plays music,pictures, and videos, and it does so well in all facets. Expandable memory is useful and cost effective and it has all the good features of the ipod in my opinion, and then some new ones. You can still use Itunes and any other organizing system you want. You should buy this player and the 4 Gb SDHC card for 35$. that and a case, and you are set for life!. 

$$;
Pros:. Features and screen. 
Cons:. Hard to tell... don�t wanna seem ridiculous.... 
Summary:. For the ones who look for a small gadget, that can play nice quality sound, great vivid pictures and video, plus radio, microphone and extras (such as calendar and tasks register)... THIS IS IT!. Some crashed?! No surprise, among millions, it�s perfectly normal some dozens would crash... Mine works like a charm!. With this looks&#38; features, quite frankly, don�t know what more you can ask for!. Greatings. 

$$;
Pros:. sound quality. 
Cons:. grease magnet. 
Summary:. This is would be my mp3 player of choice... but they just brought out a 32Gb version.. I think this could be the turning point for creative, this may just be a platform to launch them to compete with the ipod!. Not only is it cheaper than the equivalent, the ipod nano, its got a larger screen, is nearlly as small, and is almost as easy to use. The buttons just make you want to press them, and manage to be intuitive at the same time! The audio quality is superb with a brilliant equalizer and if u plug a decend pair of head phones in it will literally rock your world.. The only con i can see here is the screen does become very greasy over time, how ever, i'm easily up for whiping the screen every so often, its definately no biggy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound and video quality, compact, and light.. 
Cons:. It's not the most solid feeling player.. 
Summary:. I ordered the Creative Zen 16GB portable media player from amazon.com for $200. I've had it for two days now and am already very accustomed to it. It is an amazing music and video player. It has many features, 16GBs of built in flash memory, and an amazingly good price. In the following paragraphs I will go into detail about each aspect of the player.. Music: The Zen supports many music file types (drag and drop). It's sound quality is amazing (I use the Shure Se110 headphones). Using these headphones, I compared it to the iPod Video Gen1 and heard a noticeable quality difference. I highly recommend the Shure Se110's with this player.. Video: The Zen plays wmv video files and comes with video converting software that works great. A great thing about the video converting software is that is optimizes your video files for the player and at the same time greatly reduces the video size allowing you to hold many more videos. The video quality is also amazing. It is much clearer and brighter than the iPod Video. The screen is about the same size but has 16.7 million colors compared to 65,000 on the iPod.. Radio: The radio works well and also sounds very clear.. Pictures: I have not used this feature yet but the software can optimize your photos for the player's screen or you can just drag and drop your pictures.. Microphone: I have not used this yet but I know it will work great.. Extras: It comes with a Date &#38; Time screen, calendar, and contacts.. Settings: You can adjust the player to the exact specifications that you like such as brightness, sound quality (EQ, enhanced bass, etc.), slide show settings, etc.. The interface is simple and beautiful. The bottom line is that this player is the best I have ever had/used. Besides the fact that I am nervous about dropping it on the ground, there are no cons. I would recommend the Creative Zen 16GB to anyone who wants to move away from the iPod craze or just wants a great personal media player..

$$;
Pros:. Competitively priced. FM tuner. Sounds great. Awesome screen!!!. 
Cons:. No dedicated volume control. Media on an SD card cannot be accessed from the main menu. 
Summary:. What first struck me was that the player was almost all screen. And what a gorgeous screen it is. Vidoes looked awesome on the 2.5" screen, and I was comfortably able to watch a 40 min. episode of Life on it. Photos looked fantastic as well.. And the sound quality is simply awesome. Let's leave it at that.. It's also cheaper than the same capacity Nano and Zune while having a larger screen. It's music format compatibility is second to none although mine only seems to support album art on WMA files.. The SD card interface is also a little bit dissapointing. Media on a card must be viewed seperately from media on the player.. As far as its interfacing with my computer I find that WMP 11 is great for transferring music files. For photos and videos however, I find that treating the Zen as an external USB drive makes it easier to organize files into folders and categories.. I personally tried out the Zune 8gb and the Iriver Clix 8gb before choosing the Zen. It had a larger screen than both as well as having a more solid feel to it than the Clix. Also the Zune doesn't play protected WMA's, and both were more expensive. I chose it over the Nano simply because ipods have a reputation for mediocre sound quality and don't include FM tuners. (Seriously, in the age of do-it-all devices how can you not include a radio with a music player?) Also the Zen is cheaper and has a larger screen. I also looked at the Sansa View which has a screen that's almost as large. However, the body of the View is much bigger.. I paid $160 for the 8gb Zen and couldn't be Happier.. 

$$;
Pros:. HI MEMORY. WATCH OUT, ITS COMIN w/ 32GB!! BEAT THAT!!!. 
Cons:. NO DEDICATED VOLUME. 
Summary:. AMERICANS ARE EASY VICTIMS OF MASSIVE ADVERTISEMENTS. IPODs ARE NOTHIN BUT PRODUCTS OF MEDIA HYPE. FOR THOSE WHO SAY THIS or THAT CRASHED, SAME ALSO HAPPENNED W/ MY PREVIOUS IPOD ON ITS 2nd DAY. TECH IS NOT PERFECT. ITS A MATTER OF HAVING A BAD LUCK, I GUESS. BUT I TELL YOU, THIS IS THE GADGET TO BEAT IPOD!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great audio quality, nice screen, SD slot, radio, voice rec., video and photo. 
Cons:. gets scrached easily(buy a case), buttons hard to press while in pocket., no line in recording. 

$$;
Pros:. Zune's slim factor and increased memory. 
Cons:. user Interface is good but can be improved. 
Summary:. if this pace of Zune's improvement by microsoft continues, the day is not far behind when zune will leave apple iPod behind.. Sachin. (http://qtp.blogspot.com). 

$$;
Pros:. Small form factor, big screen, familiar menus. 
Cons:. Bigger than nano, small buttons. 
Summary:. My excursion into iPod-world (after owning a Zen USB 2.0 since 2002 that refuses to die) was a disaster. The iPod is definitely the prettiest girl on the block, but is obsessive-compulsive and narcisistic...it's the Apple way or the highway. Hence, back to Creative. I now have a few of them, they have consistant flexible menus (ever try to create a playlist on an iPod and save it...and I have an advanced degree from Harvard!). The screen is beautiful. The software is easy to use and familiar: it gets along with my computers...I know what I am dealing with. I find the build and quality of Creative products to be excellent. They hold up. The buttons are small, but now that I am used to them (same layout as the Vision W)I use them reflexively. I haven't used the SD slot yet. 16 Gigs is actually quite a lot and I have the core of my music and photo gallery with me as well as books from Audible and the public library (Overdrive -NOT Apple compatible!) Very pocketable...worth looking at!. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Super Audio quality, Great Video, SD Slot. 
Cons:. Screen 2.5" kind of small.. 
Summary:. The Creative Zen 16gb was worth the wait. I like the Secure Digital slot, picture quality is great, although I would have liked a 3" instead of 2.5" display. You can get it from Creative for $250.00.. 

$$;
Pros:. awesome sound quality, built in microphone, dazzling colour display makes it easy to watch your favorite show. Divx support, no needed software to install (shows up in "My Computer" as a drive). 
Cons:. better headphones would be good. 
Summary:. This thing is an IPOD killer unfortunately most people are stuck on the ipod name and will buy it blindly. I dont feel insulted by creative unlike apple who forces you to use their itunes software which is complete garbage.. Zen is the smart way to go. Ipod is archaic by comparison. Creative labs is an innovative company and this is my first creative mp3 player but so far so good! I love the FM tuner too - lovely to listen to while I study. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightweight, flat with a reasonably large screen with vibrant colors. 
Cons:. Bundled software needs some working on.. 
Summary:. A great replacement to my Zen MicroPhoto; with its expandable SD slot, its capacity is as big as the number of SD cards i want to carry or as of the biggest current capacity..Audio playback is fantastic with it being sharper and crisp..Video playback is also as sharp and clear... Only drawback would the bundled software as it takes quite a long while for videos to be converted to fit into the player..also it seems to be built of cheap materials..IMO maybe making it slightly heavier would be better... 

$$;
Pros:. Everything is just too good. 
Cons:. 16GB is still not enough. 
Summary:. This player is really the best. I have tried iPOD, and one thing that i dislike about iPod is the MUST to use iTune.. I got it and this player is slim, classy, reasonable priced, excellent features, unlimited memory space with SD Card.. Highly recommended!. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks awesome, Creative makes great products. 
Cons:. Why the delay in releasing the 16GB version?. 
Summary:. I emailed the folks at Creative to ask when the 16GB version is available. I got back a nice response saying it won't be available until mid-to-late Oct. It's expected to be priced at $250. For anyone that's thinking of getting it, I would recommend waiting till the 16GB version comes out - you get double the memory of the 8GB version for only $50 more. I can recommend Creative products, I own the Zen Micro 5GB version and love it, it's over 3 years old and works great! I'm only changing because of the upgrade to a color screen and more memory.. 

$$;
Pros:. 4GB IS $129.99!. 
Cons:. 16 gb not available until october. 
Summary:. creative is selling it below thier list price...if you thought it was a bargain at 150 go to their website now and order the 4gb for 129.99. 

$$;
Pros:. audio quality, video, photo..... 
Cons:. i'don't known. 
Summary:. i was trial in IEA2007, it's great...i like it. Audio quality: perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sound quality is biggest selling point for me. Screen is also very impressive for a player its size. Controls are dead simple but very well-designed.. 
Cons:. FM radio leaves something to be desired. Would have liked to see support for higher res videos/pictures and a a/v out cable. Sometimes the buttons feel very cheap.. 
Summary:. Overall I'm very happy. The sound quality is *nearly* unbeatable, the screen gets the job done more than well enough, and the interface is as good as I've ever seen. My only real complaint would be the build quality. While reliable overall, the buttons feel cheap, especially the power/hold button. My player is also prone to sudden freezes, which requires poking the tiny reset to fix.. 

$$;
Pros:. * Performance is good--good audio, good battery life. * Price is very reasonable. * Easy to expand with a 16 GB SDHC card (around $25). 
Cons:. * Some crashes. * Navigation buttons hard to use with a silicon case. * Converting videos can be slow. 
Summary:. I love my Zen and use it every day. It sounds great, boots up fairly quickly (could be faster though), and is easy to use. The user interface is decent and is fairly attractive. It syncs easily with Audible.com and Windows Media Player (WMP). With the solid state drive you can use it while running and don't have to worry about dropping it. I wish I could rename files when they're on the device, but I haven't been able to do that.. I use it for videos occasionally, but the small screen is not ideal for that unless you have great vision.. Have had some crashes, mostly around syncing. If you close WMP, for instance, with the player still connected it may need to be reset (do what WMP says, which is disconnect it when your sync is done). The navigation buttons can be hard to use with a silicon case.. For anyone capable of independent thought (i.e., anyone but an Apple slave) this is a great MP3 player. It delivers the best combination of performance and value and I've been really happy with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Almost everything. 
Cons:. ZEN Manager software is a step back. 
Summary:. My 16GB ZEN is replacing a Dell DJ, an earlier Creative product which gave me good service for almost four years but finally got too buggy. The ZEN has a lot of great features and I am basically happy with it. However, the software is a step back from what came with the Dell DJ. Specifically:. --Your files show up in the folders they were in when you transferred them from your home computer. There seems to be no way to reorganize the folders once they are on the player.. --The software does not show you the menu structure that you have on the player, only the original folders. This makes it very difficult to organize the media on your player in an efficient manner. The Dell DJ software could do this: list files by artist, album, genre, etc.. --You can only retag one file at a time. The old Dell DJ software let you highlight multiple files and retag them. I work around this by using Media Monkey to retag, but it is an annoying extra step.. My suspicion is that Creative wants you to buy their upgraded software for 40 bucks and has therefore removed capability from the included software. Very annoying.. Does anyone know of some better software that can be used to organize and retag the files on a ZEN?. 

$$;
Pros:. small, variety of capacities, big screen. 
Cons:. not full memory card integration.. 
Summary:. This is a great product. I have the 4 GB version, and havent had a single problem with it. Screen is crisp and clear, and a good size for such a small player. works great with subscription services, like Rhapsody, and videos from amazons unbox. Only thing that i have against this player is that it doesnt support full integration. what i mean by this is, unlike some mp3 players, like the sansa view, the media on the memory card isnt automatically organized into the catagories on the player. instead you have to browse through the memory card. other than that, its a great mp3 player with a good screen, battery life, and stylish look.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen, fully customizable menu, excellent sound quality, SD card expansion. 
Cons:. SD storage does not fully integrate into library, random power-ups, cheap feeling buttons. 
Summary:. To me, Creative will always be the best. I previously owned a Zen Vision:m and loved it for it's space, screen, and the oh so efficient touch strip.. The Zen has the same great sound quality and has an awesome menu system. However, i would like to see the SD expansion used as recognizable storage for music integrated into the library.. 

$$;
Pros:. SD Card support, lotsa features. 
Cons:. Crippled SD card, no bluetooth. 
Summary:. I bought two of these (one 8gb for my sister and one 16gb for myself...I was being greedy). The player works well and I think the Cnet review is pretty on point for the most part. The player is crammed full of features, it sounds good and is chock full of features that should be standard on all players.. I wish that it came with bluetooth support, but I realize that this is still a fairly high class feature, so I won't hold it against the Zen for now.. As for working with the player, My sister is not zactly techie, but she loves the player. She does rely on me to upgrade her firmware, but then I do all her electronic things for her.... I think the player is nice, but the real reason I chose it was the SD card. Since i use SD card in my digital cameras i wanted to be able to 'dump' my memory onto something while I am in the field (of saaaay Cambodia) and be able to keep shooting. The Zen has can do this and has allowed me to keep my overactive photophinger going. One caveat: The firmware only allows for you to copy over the ENTIRE SD card. which is cool if you are trying to do a mass dump quickly, but does not allow to take a single or small group of pictures for safe keeping. I hope they change this in the future as this can fill up the player quickly.. A common gripe against the SD card is that it is not supported as a part of the memory. This IS annoying, but it isn't horrid. You have to think of the SD card as a separate drive, not as a part of a player. Going to the SD card will stop your music and you can't search or browse the same way. I find that if I keep video on there, it isn't quite as jarring, and keeps my player space open for music.. Also, realize that while the Zen does play video well, I have yet to find something that will play natively. The conversion process through Windows Media isn't bad, but there are times I wish I could just stick my SD card in and watch with out planning for it. Still the video player came in handy more than once while waiting for whatever.. In all, I like the player and would recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plenty of storage, great sound, radio, terrific controls. 
Cons:. Controls need a little getting used to.... 
Summary:. I absolutely love my Zen. It sounds great, looks great, has tons of storage, includes lots of extras. Definitely the best choice!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very light, plays video very well. 
Cons:. larger screen would be nice. 
Summary:. Great product!! Had the Zen Vision plus, had to send it because of it freezing all the time. I was put off Creative, but I took a chance with them again. Got the 16gig and glad I did, no freezing, very light, sound great, plays video. 2.5 in screen is surprisingly viewable even while on the treadmill.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great color and sound, ease of use, battery life. 
Cons:. Could use better documentation. 
Summary:. I've had this player for a month now and love the way it handles music. If I never use it for anything else, it will have been worth the price. It was pretty easy to get it operational and I copied in about a hundred CD's.. I've had quite a learning experience on trying to access free audio books (not Audible) and found the documentation lacking in Creative's instructions. I finally got it done for the first time but relied a lot on my other types of computer experience to figure it out.. Because of my slow internet, I haven't done anything with downloading videos yet. The included pictures are gorgeous and I'm looking forward to loading a bunch of my own.. Battery life has been very good. Recharging via USB seems slow but the optional charger is fast. The Zen has driven all kinds of ear buds and headphones well. The layered menu system isn't hard to use and just takes practice to get familiar with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. SD card slot!! light, cheaper than I-pod.. 
Cons:. Screen is small and not sharp enough. 
Summary:. The additional SD card slot is what makes the Zen a better choice than other mp3 players around. The screen though, is more of a gimmick than a real useful feature. I mean why would I want to view pics of vids with that 2.5 inch screen when the display on my camera and PSP are much larger and sharper. I'm looking forward to the next generation of Zen when the buttons will be replaced by a touch screen, so they won't use up so much space and thus leave more room for the screen. 

$$;
Pros:. Large, crisp screen. Tactile controls. Custom shortcut button. WMA support, nearly doubling the amount of music I can carry with me. Small size for the capacity, features, and screen. 
Cons:. Incomplete sd card integration. Intermittent flickering when changing songs. Can't play as many formats (audio and video) as the Zen Vision:M. 
Summary:. I actually have one of the 32GB ones. In the month and a half I've used it, it has met or exceeded all expectations.. It is literally the size of a credit card and only 0.44" thick.. I also use it with the Creative Hard Case, which adds thickness, but it's still very pocketable, and the integrated kickstand is a plus. From an angle, there is a rainbow sheen on the case, but from straight on, it's very clear. There is no protection for the buttons on the clear case, so I used a clear screen protector film to protect them. The case is a tight fit, and the film will make it harder to get the case closed, so don't use too much film. I don't use the carabiner that comes with the hard case, because it's kinda weak, and on the NYC subway, someone's liable to literally rip it off of you.. I use MediaMonkey to sync, which by itself is brilliant. MediaMonkey Gold will re-encode and sync on the fly. I use WMA's on the device to save space (8000+ songs, 2 full length movies, 5GB to spare. , and the quality is good enough for the morning commute.. SD card integration is slowly improving with the firmware updates, but is still largely separate. I'm not too concerned because I plan on using the main memory for music, and the SD card for video.. Sound quality, even with the WMA's, is outstanding. I'm using Skullcandy Ink'd Noise Isolating earbuds (cheap and sufficient until my Etymotic's arrive), and on a busy subway, I rarely raise the volume above 10. There is also an EQ for tailoring the sound to your taste.. Video must be re-encoded to play on the device. Yes, it will play Divx. I use iRiverter, with the Zen Vision:M setting. The included conversion software will work, but it only converts to wmv, it's slow as a dog (intel E4300, 1gb ram), and the end result on the player is not as good as what is produced with iRiverter.. If you get this player, if you want to preserve battery life, the hold button becomes your best friend. AFAIK, using the hold button ensures the screen is off while playing if you don't need it, and is the only way to ensure the player is completely off and not in standby mode when you turn it off.. It's annoying, but you get used to it quickly, and it turns into a non-issue.. FM radio works well (when I use it), I don't use the Organizer (got a BB 8320 for that), and I also haven't tried the Microphone....but I may try that to record a meeting later.... I have yet to try it with Linux, but I'm sure that community will adapt soon.. I have yet to experience the WSOD that I see people complaining of in the forums. Not with the original firmware that came with the player (1.13.01) and not with the upgraded firmware (1.20.02). Overall, I'm very happy with the Creative Zen, and recommend it with no reservations for someone who doesn't mind getting thier hands a bit dirty. This player requires a bit more initial attention than the iPods, but for me is worth it for the greater flexibility and features.. 

$$;
Pros:. low price, good sound quality. 
Cons:. some features are confusing. 

$$;
Pros:. All the bells and whistles that a mp3 could have an then some! Good software. The big seller is the SD slot for expansion and a higer satisfaction rating.. 
Cons:. Make sure your mp4's are suited for the player or it freezes. Needs to be reformated with the Zen software. Picts will not save in the order selected. 5" USB cable. &gt;p. 
Summary:. MY FIRST MP3. Wow, I thought it would be a no brainer...ipod. Then I got the lowdown to Apple's priopertiary dominance to i-tunes and no one else. That sucked! The majority of my-tunes came from another legal source that won't upload with ipods newst software with out possibably jumping through a few firey hoops! Hmmmm, I had to rethink this one as I don't support monopoly companies if I can help it! Especially, since I've already invested the $$$ into my-music, I didn't want to start from scratch or take that chance. Onward and upward!. THE RESEARCH! It came down to two mp3 players the Zen and the Sansa. Both have the same features, close to the same price range and the the SD expansion slot. Although the Sansa uses the micro card and the Zen uses the next size of SD cards, it made a difference since I already have a few of these cards from other devices. The Sansa had a few available aftermarket products as where the Zen required ordering them.. DECISION TIME! Ok, the Zen. Same SD card-check. 16MB for under $200-check. Biggest seller...accross the rating board, it has the highest satisfaction rate. Clincher!. MOMENT OF TRUTH. I'm glad I made the decision I did. In a perfect world all mp3's would be flawless but this world isn't perfect and neither are mp3's. Zen has some things to work on, like workable mp4s that don't freeze up. Second, creating a seamless use of the SD card with readable content though their software. Third, micro mp3's are good but micro USB cables-BAD! If your HDD is on the floor then you'll need a longer cable. The one included with the device is only 5 inches long. Lastly, saving your pictures in the order you saved them in and not by a unforseeable requirement that the software chooses.. Could be user error...or not. I will be honest I haven't read "Zen for Dummies" yet and that being said, it could be me but the software is user freindly, once loaded on my comuter it took over downloading my mp3's &#38; some mp4's with little effort on my part.. OVERALL, the Zen is doing fine with what I wanted it for, that being a quick plug and play one source for the car. All the other perks are great and will eventually be used and for now I'm happy!. 

$$;
Pros:. Flash player, beautiful colors, music sounds great, photos look great. 
Cons:. Cheap feeling controls, backlight only goes completely off when player is locked. 
Summary:. I really like this player. I had the Creative Zen Micro for 2 and a half years, so it was time to get a new one.. I really have no major complaints--the music sounds great, the colors are awesome and it's a relatively fast player. Not to mention the design--I LOVE it.. However, I don't like the control pad. It feels really cheap and I'm scared I'm going to break it one day. I can actually move the buttons, which is a concern. Also, I can't figure out how to get the backlight to go off when the player is turned on. It's always on. I have it at the lowest setting, but I think it still drains the battery. The only time it will go off is when it's in the locked position.. Other than that, it's a great investment. I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good, flash-based mp3 player that isn't an Apple product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, ease of use, controls, size. 
Cons:. Took away the FM recording, would be nice to have a wall charger as well. 
Summary:. This new Zen is very nice. I love the small size and the controls are much easier to use then the click wheel of an IPod or sliders of previous Zens. The only 2 things I wish is that you could change the order of the music on the fly (IE by name, or by length, by album) like you can on the Ipod with Itunes. And not being able to record from the FM radio like the older units is a detriment. Other then these small snags its a great MP3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small and light size, clarity of sound and vision, ease of use. 
Cons:. Won't play Audible files on SD card. 
Summary:. Because I am in an informal reviewer position at a college, I own a handful of MP3 players, including the iPod classic 30GB, the Treo 700P, a Zune 2nd generation, the Creative Vision M, the Creative Muvo, and an RCA MP3 player. Easily this one beats out all the others, although the Treo does a fine job for basic stuff and handles everything else as well. If you only get to buy one product, make it a smartphone, but if you can afford to also own a dedicated MP3 player the Zen is an amazingly clear and easy to use device that doesn't require much time to figure out how to use. It has many little niceties for the user that companies like Apple or Microsoft won't provide, such as agnostic support for file types, and the ability to delete files directly off the device. The controls are satisfying and easily usable by touch, which is handy in the dark, and it doesn't require me to bother with annoying slider control inaccuracies. The one area I'd suggest Creative works on is the SD card - sure there is a better way to integrate the SD card content with rest of the content on the device, and why on earth can't I play Audible files from the SD card? Still, these aren't deal breakers - nice job, Creative!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen, standard usb interface, good battery life, user interface is easy to use,. 
Cons:. No direct user interface option for listening to Podcast, cant make playlists on the fly. 
Summary:. I have been waiting for an MP3 player that could hold all of my music while I exercise (I only use flash based players for that) and this fits the bill. I am not much of a video watcher so the capacity is more than enough for my growing library. I had to return my first one because of hardware issues but the second one works great! I think think that is better than the ipod nano because of screen size and standard interface. I can't wait for more accessories to be released! I do wish that there was a direct link to podcasts on the user interface. I have to dig through my music library to find them. Overall a great player for those who like exercising to new hits every week!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent audio quality, nice screen, easy to use, great software. 
Cons:. Worried about buttons, front cover could be better. 
Summary:. First up some caveats: I LOVE Creative products. This is my fifth Creative Zen player. I bought a Zen Micro for my oldest daughter and loved it so much I bought one for myself. A year later I bought my youngest daugther a Zen MicroPhoto. Shortly after that I bought my son a Zen V Plus. All have worked flawlessly. I just replaced the battery on my Zen.. Second caveat: I HATE absolutely anything, and everything iPod. I hate Apple, Mac, all of it. While I think a lot of their MP3 players are the bomb looks-wise, their crappy sound and even worse, their proprietary everything just annoys the crap out of me. I loved the look of the new Nanos and if they worked with music subscription sites like Napster-to-go or Rhapsody I might have broken down and bought one. But no.. This was a three pronged approach to this purchase. I was finally jumping on the subscription music bandwagon and was looking for a new MP3 player. I always come here for unbiased professional and - even more important - your reviews. I eagerly awaited the new 16GB version and have had it a couple days now. I haven't done video with it - and I don't know if I ever will. I'm into the music so that's what I use it for. So let's go there.. First up, impressions out of the box. I like the look and the layout. I'm not crazy about the look and feel of the buttons though. They seem... cheap. One guy here had both of his fail a few days after getting it, the left dial one. For some reason, all the buttons when pressed to the left seem to feel like they are rubbing on something - it's not a smooth click. It actually FEELS like it's going to break sooner rather than later. Obviously only time will tell on that. I also don't really like the super-shiny cover that ecompasses the entire top. With the black color, fingerprints are the order of the day with this and I worry also about scratches in the future. But it cleans up real nice with some of those pre-moistened lens wipes. I do like the black look and really like the brushed aluminum back. I would prefer the whole thing be like that except for the screen. Maybe next time. But CNET is right - it does look classy.. The screen color and resolution is great. Pictures pop nicely and I really like the ability to change the backgrounds, although the selections are a little limited. Of course you can always set any picture as the backgroud wallpaper so that opens things up. The menus were pretty easy to learn to use but I went into the online documentation to read up on things and it was well written and imformative.. Software installation was easy as usual and pretty quick. I did go onto the Creative site and look for upgraded firmware (done automatically as part of installation) and sure enough there was already two 'critical' updates to install. But those went on quickly also and two reboots later I was up and running.. The first order of business for me was seeing how well this player functioned with my new Napster-to-go subscription. Napster and Creative normally work very well together and this unit was no different. Napster immediately recognised my player and within a few seconds I was downloading several hundred songs and playlists to the Zen. I'm also planning on doing a user review on the Napster-to-go so look for that if you're thinking of trying it out. I for one, LOVE it. 5 million songs to choose from and more every day.. I bought the 16GB version straight from Creative the day they got them. The earbuds suck but I'm used to that and had other plans anyway - the previously mentioned third prong of this music attack. I did buy along with the Zen the leather case they offered. It was only $25 and looked pretty good but I was dissapointed with it. Truth be told, I'll carry the Zen in my shirt pocket anyway, without the leather case. I might try some of those temporary protectors they sell if I start to notice the screen getting scratched up a little. I tend to take pretty good care of my stuff but this player does not seem or feel as stout as my Zen Micro.. So I downloaded a bunch of songs from Napster and then a bunch more already ripped from my private collection on my computer. I also loaded up a few family pictures. The Zen Media software works very well and is very easy to use. But it's just a simple to go into Explorer and drag and drop or copy and paste stuff in too. Pretty basic and simple stuff.. The player also came with a REALLY short USB cable for both charging and transferring data. I actually like the short cable but I'm sure there are going to be a few that do not. I also prefer a dedicated charger and for the price think they could have and should have included one. Fortunately for me, I got one way back with my Zen Micro and it has always worked with EVERY Zen I've owned - something I am very grateful for. Kudo's to Creative for keeping the same power/transfer connectors on all their models.. Now on to where the Zen really shines - the music. Creative always get's high marks for it's audio quality and this one does not disappoint. The sound quality is AMAZING. This is helped somewhat by my third prong attack - I bought some nice Bose full ear cup headphones. I've already reviewed those at the proper place on this site. The combination of those two are nothing short of astounding. I'll never wear earbuds again. You don't even need any EQ. It's quite amazing. I bought the Bose headphones at Best Buy for $139.00. Pricey but worth every penny and you can spend a whole lot more.. There's plenty of neat features on this player too. Most I won't ever use but it's nice that they are there. The SD expansion slot might come in handy some day if I every do decide to do video but with the Napster-to-go subscription I'm pretty sure my music will be rotating a lot. And with 16GB, I won't need to move too many. I understand that some people are upset that the SD slot memory is not added to the existing memory and I think that's probably a valid point. But it's not a big deal to me because quite frankly I don't plan to carry around more than 4000 songs at any one time.. Probably my biggest thing I like about this player is the Smart Volume feature. One of my pet peeves is the different levels of loudness between older CD's and new CD's. Constantly having to bump up the volume for one song and then have to bump it back down (especially after it hurts your ears) for the next is annoying on so many levels. The Smart Volume when turned on automatically levels the playing field increasing and decreasing volume where necessary to keep the level comfortably the same. This is a God-send to someone like me, an old guy who could be listening to some Jim Croce one moment and then have Nickelback blaring the next! I tend to play the songs on Shuffle a lot so this can happen frequently. My music tastes run the gammut so this feature is the bomb.. In summary, I love the player - so far. If the screen doesn't scratch easily, and the buttons don't fail, and all keeps working as it does now, I'll be very happy. I gave the player an 8. Had the buttons felt better I'd have given it a 9 and had the cover been all brushed aluminum, it would have gotten a full 10. Rest assured I'll keep you posted and you'll be the first to know if something does go wrong. Okay, you'll be the second as Creative will be the first. But for all intents and purposes as of this writing - Creative has another winner on their hands!. M.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen, excellent sound quality, FM radio, decent storage capacity, very good GUI. 
Cons:. Can't record radio. 
Summary:. I was SO excited about this player when I heard it was coming out. So much so, that I waited an extra 6 months before buying a new mp3 player (my previous player was a Creative Zen Micro). Everything I read about this player sounded fantastic, and after receiving it yesterday, I completely agree...almost. The one GLARING problem with this player when compared to my Zen Micro is the lack of ability to record FM radio. I know that other Creative players came under attack a while ago by the RIAA, but I thought those issues got resolved and that newer firmware updates re-instated FM recording. Why the newest addition to the Zen family has to go without this crucial functionality is a mystery to me.. Other than that, this is a great player and I'm just hoping that future firmware upgrades will revise this problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. it isnt a review. 
Cons:. i gave it an 8. 
Summary:. I have a question... why do people consider the Creative Zen better than the iPod Touch?Isnt the iPod touch suppose to be better with WiFi? iPod Touch seems like a good deal with good battery life and an amazingly slim body with a larger screen. So just wondering why would this be better? As well as the screen is just ample.. it wouldnt it be hard to watch a movie. As well as wouldnt Archos be a better deal with a good hard drive, a large screen, and with wifi that uses Opera?Please comment...basically... why would creative be a better deal that the 604 wifi Archos and the iPod Touch?. 

$$;
Pros:. Video quality, ease of use, on board software, SD /SDHC slot. 
Cons:. Need an adapter to overcome the USB-based power supply. 
Summary:. The new Creative Zen builds up the already nice features I found in the V Plus series: ease of use, straight-forward procedures to move files from the PC to the Zen, a nice but not too flashy GUI, and overall a nice feeling of a nicely built and engineered user experience.. This Zen has also got a few nice adds: a crispy video, able to get you through idle times (tube strikes included!!!) watching some favs, which you can also have stored into an SD / SDHC card, which is the other plus the Creative Zen is boasting. Spending your money over the 4Gb model will not hinder your storage and media playing capability after all!!. A strong player and a great contender to the usual suspect(s)!!.

$$;
Pros:. very sleek, minimalist, excellent sound and portability, expandable. 
Cons:. SD card contents not merged with flash memory, only 16 gb. 
Summary:. This product is not available for purchasing yet, so am not sure what most of the reviews are about, besides impressions from commercials or website reviews. But there is no doubt that from the info available and the specs this product is right on target for those who: 1) care for the best sound quality (Creative is top of the market on that); 2) for sound customization (custom EQ); 3) for portablity (credit card size); 4) simple interface and connectivity (USB port); 5) don't need over 16 GB of space. I can't wait to try one of these babies. Unfortunately it appears that the media you put in the card can't be transferred to the flash drive, nor is it merged with flash drive contents (to search, etc.). That's a pity, but we all hope on Creative firmware updates to make these features available.. 

$$;
Pros:. small, SD slot, thin. 
Cons:. no touch screen, no internet, but none of that is really needed. 
Summary:. well i think that this is a GREAT competitor for the new ipod touch. it has the same amount of memory, but waaaaaaaaaaaay cheaper. and it comes with an SD slot. but i have a feeling there will be an ipod touch with one soon. and this has an FM radio and a radio. but this does not have a touch screen, which is not really needed at all, this has no wi-fi, but that is not really important either.. 

$$;
Pros:. pretty, same size screen as ipod classic and only slightly thicker, cheaper. 
Cons:. can't vouch for ease of use just yet. 
Summary:. But I plan on getting one soon because it's drool-worthy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, ease of use, interface, small size, excellent screen. 
Cons:. Limited file format support (podcasts require conversion), SD card treated separately in interface creates inconvenience. 
Summary:. This is an excellent PMP. And I've tried lots. Cowon D2 and I7. Meizu M6. Archos 605. This beats them all... except perhaps the new Sony NWZ-A800 series which I love thanks to its native video podcast (H.264) support.. Creative have done a really nice job with the user interface. Slick and pretty responsive. I like the "DJ" function, great for quick hits. The SD card however is treated as a separate storage unit and is not integrated with rest of the media. Hopefully this will change in a future firmware update.. I also like the standard mini USB cable, the shortcut key that is customizable (nice!), and the vibrant screen.. Overall excellent. Highly recommended. For those looking for video podcast compatibility - albeit smaller screen - check out the new Sony NWZ-A800 series.. 

$$;
Pros:. 16.7 million colors display, best audio, SD slot. 
Cons:. A/V-out port? where is it?. 
Summary:. although not as touchy as ipod... zen has a VERY good video sound quality... which is why i bought the Zen vision:M instead of the Ipod 5G. i Just like its beautiful screen and it made me so happy with its bass boost, Excellent sound quality. SD slot was a very good and wise move.. Why doesn't it have the A/V-out port??? man. i did enjoy alot addin, watchin Films in dvd-rip AVI (good quality) in my big screen TV. Plus they could've included a touchpad instead of that controlpad on the side, and also a volume controller. tough touch has all those features and the touch screen, i still like alot the new Zen, a bit disappointed, but its V/S quality... DAMN!. I still didn't decide which one to "empty my pockets on", Ipod Touch or Creative Zen. Zens' PROS are IpodTouchs' CONS and vice-versa, its a difficult choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound, good video playback, works with Rhapsody and Amazon Video, SD card expansion. 
Cons:. Poor buggy software, Slow transfer speeds, SD card doesn't integrate into menu system.. 
Summary:. Really good music player, light small with good sized screen. I love Creative products.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great for my music mobility which is why I purchased it.. 
Cons:. Cant find any accesories for it around here at the few major department stores and electronic stores.. 
Summary:. I need more time with it and i will update this.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best screen of the bunch, sound quality is ok with included headphones, itunes and audible compatible. 
Cons:. Firmware issues, no FM recording, no WiFi, limited podcasting library.. 
Summary:. The size is perfect for on the go, and watching something on the screen is not uncomfortable, even for long periods of time. With the exception of needing to reset the player three times it has been pretty robust. I reloaded the newest firmware and I haven't had to reset it since.. The interface is really intuitive. Love the calendar and contact sync with Outlook.. I love that my iTunes library can be essentially copied right to the player, but in order to listen to the podcasts I listen to I have to download in iTunes then convert to AAC and then put it on the player. So, the extra step is a hassle. And you must create a playlist to exclude podcasts and audiobooks from the music. Zencast is far from offering the same number of podcasts as iTunes, but hopefully that will change with time.. For Creative to truly compete with the iPod it must come up with an iTunes alternative, or a third developer needs to come up with a solution that supports all the major MP3 players. There's just too many steps for the non-geek to get what they want on the player, but for those who are tech-savy the expansion slot makes this a perfect alternative to the iPod.. I find the included earbuds to be a little subpar from a comfort and sound perspective, and a little short in length. FM recording would be nice, like my MuVo.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good audio, easy to use, nice software. 
Cons:. Uncomfortable headphones. 
Summary:. I've only had my Zen for a few days, so I haven't used the video function yet. The audio, though, is very, very good. It did take me a couple days to get used to the controls, but once you figure out what does what, it's a breeze. Overall, the Zen itself appears to be very well-designed.. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the headphones - the sound is OK, but they're really uncomfortable and tend to fall out. A bad design that is curious considering the player itself - it's sort of like putting cheap retreads on a high-performance car.. Overall, I like the Zen a lot but it looks like I'll have to shell out some bucks for new headphones.. 

$$;
Pros:. SDHC card support. 
Cons:. No in line encoding, battery usage could be better. 
Summary:. Having looked at other MP3 devices and their power output which is freely available, I emailed Creative to request the output on this player in MW's. I was a little puzzled by their response. It is interesting that it is not quoted anywhere even in the CNET review :. Thank you for contacting us at Creative Technical Support. We do appreciate the chance to assist you in any way possible.. With regard to the question that you are having, we understand that you wish to know the MW power output for our latest ZEN players.. May we know why do you require such information? From what we can understand it, such information are confidential..

$$;
Pros:. Expandable Memory. 
Cons:. Everything Else. 
Summary:. I don't own this product. But I do have something to say about it. Since it has the same amount of storage as the iPod touch, they're comparable. This player is 100 dollars cheaper than the 16gb Touch, but that doesn't mean its worth it. The amount of features present in the Touch, from the accelerometer, to the multitouch user interface, to the wifi, to the internet browser... and the fact that the Touch is thinner than this product lead me to conclude, except for the expandable memory, this product blows. You'd be an idiot to not spend the extra 100 bucks and get yourself a 16gb ipod touch. OR even, for the SAME price, and 8gb touch that can do so much more than this product its quite disgusting.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound, lots of features. It's compact and light, and the display is excellent.. 
Cons:. No SD memory integration into music library.. 
Summary:. I bought the 4 GB model a year or so ago because my old 16 GB Zen touch was crapping out, but I couldn't afford the 16 GB model on this one. I figured I would just upgrade when I had the dough. I finally picked up a 16 GB SD card yesterday, took it home and crammed most of my music onto the new card. Imagine my dismay when I discovered that I now have to access all that music via the "Memory card" section, separate from "Music," and that none of the menus or modes available in the music section are available in the memory card section. No random play and no continuous play (i.e., once an album finishes the music stops). If you have just one song by an artist, once that song ends the music stops, and you have to manually select the next artist or song. If you turn it off you have to start all over the next time you turn it on. This is a gigantic pain in the ass. Why even have the capacity for extra memory if the hardware doesn't allow you to manage it?. After bad experiences with two different Creative models I think I am done with Creative.. 

$$;
Pros:. Economic, Cheap, Affordable for students. 
Cons:. Not as great as Ipod's style and quality. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp Screen! Best Sound!. 
Cons:. Freezing moments are REALLY BAD!. 
Summary:. This is a good product. Sharp display will make you feel like you're in cinema or theater. The sound? Perfect. But I must warn that if you decide to get this device, automatically you are agreeing company's one hidden policy that said "Reset everytime it freeze." If the one you get is not freezing, then you're lucky! Buy some loterry.. Before you decide buying anything, get as much information as you can get first. Like, go to their website, then check what are the possible problems this player has. This is my suggest after facing the same problem as I changed two Zen player for freezing reason.. 

$$;
Pros:. Near perfect player, great audio and features. 
Cons:. SD data not seamlessly integrated. 
Summary:. Being highly interested in purchasing this player I did some more research. I find out that the SD expansion slot is designed poorly. Consumer beware! You think you are going to just pop in an SD card and jack up the memory of this unit.....sort of.. All data stored on the SD is kept separate from the main on-board memory. So all those extra songs you put on the SD will be hidden away in their own lists.. Pray for a firmware update to make the data on the SD expansion seamlessly integrated with all your other data.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size. 
Cons:. Looks cheap.. 
Summary:. I'am an Apple Ipod user. Although I have used and I do like the Creative Zen MP3 players. I still prefer Apple ipods, but this one does look promising. Nothing wrong with either choice. Just my two cents.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has expandable memory, Nicely designed, Has all the features you would want.. 
Cons:. Died within the first year of owning, Comes with no software, USB cable is unpredictable and way too short, Puts on music/pictures/video that you never asked to have put on.. 
Summary:. My first MP3 player was an original 30GB Zune that I thought was bad since it had a few problems with it from time to time. And as soon as I heard of the ZEN, it looked very appealing. Little did I know that the Zune looks like a saint compared to the ZEN.. The first thing I didn't like is that it doesn't really have any software. With an iPod you have iTunes, with Zune you have Zune software. The ZEN just has a program you use to rip music/pictures/movies onto the device that's it, that's all it does.. The next issue was the ZEN comes with a really short USB cable that is highly unpredictable and way too short. A lot of the time you will be ripping music and it cuts off and you have to close everything and re-open it and it's a major hassle.. And probably the main problem with it is that it dies so easily. I had it less then a year, and a good part of that time I just had it in the corner, not doing anything. Maybe that's what killed it? I don't know. But I will say, I wasn't very sad that it was dead.. The only really positive note I can give for the ZEN is that it does work. It's a hassle to get to work just the way you want it to, but it can work and function fine.. In short, don't get the ZEN. There are way too many problems with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pretty and can fit in your pocket. 
Cons:. SD card issue to much money for 16GB. 
Summary:. Unless you want a small player I can't see why anyone would want this. Creative has a history of relinquishing support after a few years. I have a jukebox no support. Archos seems to be the best thing out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, clear screen.. 
Cons:. Only USB charging, have to convert video files to view them.. 
Summary:. I had the old Zen Vision:M 30GB before (which got stolen on a bloddy train of all places) so when I was gonna replace it this seemed like the obvious choice. I can't say I'm very happy with it though. Didn't include and charger, it can only be charged via USB which I find a hassle. Also, all video files need to be converted which takes FOREVER! All in all, I'd go with a different player!. /Phil803. Read my blog about giving up smoking at &lt;a href="http://www.tobaccosmokeless.net/"&gt;http://www.tobaccosmokeless.net/&lt;/a&gt;. 

$$;
Pros:. It has a nice screen and plays ok music. 
Cons:. still working. 
Summary:. I looked around for weeks to find the right mp3 player (partially because it was for Christmas) now the spftware to use the player is annoing, hard to update, cant be used as an external drive, need ID3 tags on all songs (took forever to find a program to put those on (program called tag scanner)), radio is a bit iffy, no FLAC, SD card slot is only good for photos, mic has no gain control, it is a real pain to get movies on it in the right form (but i can guess other mp3 players have the same problemas well, have to buy a wall charger case plus screen protector, and to the better battery life while listing to music you have to put on the hold switch and in doing that it will turn of the screen.. Note: I have the 16GB. wish i got a Cowon iAudio 7. 

$$;
Pros:. nice screen, high flash memory capacity. 
Cons:. freezes, horrible battery power. 
Summary:. I bought this new product based upon the reputation of Creative, the amount of flash memory and various versatile features. What I got was a Creative Labs beta product for testing at the expense of customers who bought it.when it works it is great but it frequently freezes or shuts off. However the biggest disappointment is the PATHETIC short battery life. I use it to workout and would be lucky to get 2 two hour workouts before the battery dies. I have not been so lucky. I expected more from such an expensive unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful looking player, SD card reader, flash based, small. 
Cons:. Insufficient memory, cheap feeling, no power adapter included, cheap headphones. 
Summary:. Creative really dropped the ball on this one. To replace their already stellar mass capacity hard-drive player with this nimble device disappoints me. It is too soon to replace hard drive players with flash based. 16 gb may suit many people, but with the Zune, Toshiba Gigabeat and iPod at the same price with 5x as much space, it seems like I could have spent my money a bit better. I do however like how pocketable this device is. Very small unlike the Zune(which is, however, my new choice of player). ***When I bought this off of Amazon, I received a player with a broken left directional pad button, which frustrated me a lot. I could not move left through ANY of the menus, making the device very difficult to manage. I returned it 2 weeks later, took the refund and bought myself the new Zune. 

$$;
Pros:. Actually holds its own against competition. 
Cons:. Creative is a has been, and not cool anymore. 
Summary:. After playing with one of these at best buy, I would much rather buy 4-5 other players than this one. That includes 3 ipods!. Seriously, Creative is on a losing streak coolnesswise, and will have a hard time now with Microsoft in the business. I don't see them catching and momentum in this crowded field.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent quality sound, nice colorful screen, a lot of cool features, very cute and portable.. 
Cons:. Cheap plastic cover at the front (easily gets scratched), one color available, not a lot of accessories designed for the mp3, no gapless function.. 
Summary:. The first thing I thought about this mp3 is that I'd finally found a reason to not buy an iPod. Sound quality was better than iPod's, it was much more beautiful than the new nano series and has a lot more extras (voice recording, radio and so on).. But, 2 hours later, the 5 ways touch pad has broken up! Impossible to use the left button! My mother's Zen totaly stopped working! So we are both returning the product.. There is a lot of returns for this mp3 by now (look at amazons store reviews for the same mp3). My suggestion is to wait a bit so that Creative can fix up the problem. When it'll be done, it will be an AMAZING MP3.. 

$$;
Pros:. Memory, interface. 
Cons:. Aftercare, firmware. 
Summary:. Had a very bad experience with Creative where my player froze. After contacting the customer service eight times and getting the wrong answer every time (despite being given a tracking number) the eventually sent me an email with a docket attached so I could return the device. I returned it and they replaced it with a second hand device that broke after a few weeks. I had the same problem again with incompetent staff, not being given contact details and not being allowed to return the device. The worst customer care experience of my life and it put me off buying on line for months. Avoid Creative like the plague. You?ve been warned. I heard a lot of similar stories since. I wish I?d been more aware of this company?s terrible reputation. NEVER AGAIN! After that I bought a much cheaper device that has worked like a charm for the last year and a half. I wish I'd gone with Apple but avoided them due to favoring the underdog.. 

$$;
Pros:. Really liked the buttons over competitors pads. Got an absolute action with every touch, not the floudering of the "touchy" fingerpads.. 
Cons:. Bookmarks for audiobooks have a serious bug which affects the bookmarking. Creative aware, but send out these flawed units anyway!. 
Summary:. Go to the store and stay away from the online retailing of this stuff, at least you can walk in a get a problem sorted. No phone numbers on the website. No reference to bookmark troubleshooting on the website. Lost the $35 bux paid for an overnight shipment as well as suffered a compromised return credit for the asscessory skins and screen protector that were removedfrom packing and applied to the BROKEN device.. Arguing w/ Amazon over a product by Creative is a SERIOUS fruitless nightmare.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, SD expandability. 
Cons:. Constantly freezes unexpectedly (while playing audio or even while rebuilding). 
Summary:. So I was excited to find something that would replace both my iPod Shuffle and 20gb iPod. Got this as a gift for Christmas, guess Santa thought I was good! But nope, turned out to be worth less than a lump of coal.. It constantly freezes up while playing audio files. You'll have to carry a paperclip with the player in order to reset. And trust me, you'll use it often. It even freezes up when trying to rebuild.. I've tried everything, firmware upgrade, reformatting, using the "recovery tool", draining out the battery, all to no avail. Trying to return this sucker is a pain in the butt. Creative's site is a maze that brings you back to the same page everytime you want to contact Customer Support. By the time you finally find the magic link - you're only allowed to send out an e-mail. This wild goose chase only gets you more frustrated.. It would have been an amazing mp3 player if it only worked smoothly. No iPod has SD expandability. I would definitely wait until Creative has worked out all the bugs before considering the Zen unless you're up for a gamble.. 

$$;
Pros:. screen, sound quality, controls. 
Cons:. be a tech adventurer. 
Summary:. Ill start by saying that I have issues with things that dont work as described right out of the box. Whenever I have to spend my time and effort to bring an item to its advertised features and functions, I question the validity of the product. The ZEN has a strong feature set but some dont work without substantial tinkering. A complete description of what might be available can be found in the product listing here or on the Creative site. Below is my experience.. My first adventure started with the A/V being out of sync. The included software (the latest and using the most current firmware for the player) resulted in a painfully slow conversion process to WMV that yielded a progressively out of sync video. As the video ran, the sound would increasingly lag. This led to my first workaround consisting of many hours of reading posts all over the place and downloading a half-dozen different progs. I found one with a modest learning curve and about six hours of experimentation converting clips that addressed that issue with success: research and related time invested, about 20 hours.. The device did not recognize sub-folders for playback purposes nor existing .MU3 play lists. I could, however, create sub-folders but for personal organization, only. I loaded my music through the mandated, included software and had to rebuild play lists that already existed. Please note that this player keys to ID tags so, if you, like I, have ripped a lot of old vinyl albums, youll have to spend hours building ID tags on the computer as you cant do it once the track is on the device. Thus, if not done, album tracks will be out of sequence as the player re-sorts everything regardless of how you drop it into its storage. Time invested in building ID tags, sorting tracks into sub-folders, creating new play lists from re-sorted sub-sub-folders, etc., about 6 hours.. I was unable to move files once on the ZEN. I could delete them, only. If I wanted to change the location, I had to delete and upload, again. That proved to be an annoying inconvenience. The files were regular MP3s and I can think of no reason why they were not allowed to migrate. This, also, disallowed backing up the contents of the player when I had to reformat it&all gone, back to square one.. Several MP3s that I had exported to the player became corrupted. There was nothing consistent about the files that may have contributed; seemed random. I wasnt aware that they were corrupted until I was searching for a track that I knew was there but wouldnt play. I had to browse all 800 or so tracks, delete, upload, rebuild play lists, etc.. Theres quite a bit more that resulted in my returning the ZEN for a refund. I had read the reviews and noted all the praise. Where did I go wrong? Well, I didnt read those four and five star reviews well enough. They seem to have a an implied asterisk attached; works great once you jump through this hoop and that fire-ring. Wow, how can you give something high praise when you have to spend so much time fixing it or conceding that half its functions dont work? Perhaps its all relative. If so, about everything else must REALLY suck and this sucks less because of its beautiful screen and great sound quality. Ill wait before further investments and hang in with my three year old, 1gb MP3/4 player from god-only-knows where but has NEVER caused me a lick trouble and the conversion software is fast and efficient enough to produce in-sync video. Go figure.. 

$$;
Pros:. looks nice. 
Cons:. bad build quality. 
Summary:. Creative does not stand behind their products, you'll pay and pay to have them fix problems (that re-occur).. 

$$;
Pros:. ZEN (16mb) is great when it works .... 
Cons:. Used w. Rhapsody to go. - Frequent hang on downloads. - Freq 'rebuild'. - Had to re-format resulting in wasted time.. - Had to re-format again after reloading 75% of device (along with freq hangs). - V. poor media software. - Customer support non-existent. 
Summary:. CNET should do a better job looking at user issues and customer support before they recommend a product. I have had nothing but problems with my device. A web search will show the issues I have mentioned are not infrequent. It should be better than this. And Creative customer support is non-existent. The only response to to reformat device. No acknowledgment of the inherent problems. Don't beleive me - do a google search for "Creative Zen" "Customer Support". Bottom line - spend your money some where else - its not just the initial $ - it's is the wasted time spent trying to load and keep the thing working. Frustrating.... 

$$;
Pros:. Great paperweight. 
Cons:. Terrible support. 
Summary:. Avoid at all cost. 

$$;
Pros:. FM tuner, small size and weight. 
Cons:. Doesn't work w/ MS Vista, Poor email based support.. 
Summary:. The Creative Labs Company should offer to buy back these bug ridden MP3 players.. This player is less reliable than the first generation Zune (which also has software issues). The Ipod Classic works very well but, the old Zen Xtra (with beefed up headphone jack) is by far my favorite MP3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, nice features, nice screen.. 
Cons:. not great battery life, and NO SD INTEGRATION. 
Summary:. This could be a wonderful product, but for the fact that the SD slot is not integrated like it is in some Sandisk players and the Cowan D2. Do not buy this product if the SD slot is what you find attractive about it, becase it is not integrated. This means that you cannot access file on the SD slot from the normal interface. You have to to the SD folder, and choose the file there. Your will not be able to search your music in the normal video library, and you will lose your place in the music if you turn the player off or hit the back button. Also, you will not be able to see any album art or other cool stuff like that on the SD card. For a just a little more money, you can get the Cowan D2 and have a mp3 player that is able to grow with your library.. Without the integration, this product is just another could have been. Spend your money on something else.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, light, easy to use. 
Cons:. Frequently freezes - won't respond to controls. 
Summary:. I am on my 3rd Creative Zen V 2GB MP3 player, in less than 1 year. The 1st was stolen. The 2nd "froze" and no longer responded to the reset button. I am now experiencing the same problem with #3! I'd recommend a different brand!. 

$$;
Pros:. I have mostly great things to say about creative's MP3 players. I have 2 and am completely satisfied with both.. 
Cons:. Customer support is the sales team. So if you have a problem they will ask you to buy new player. No support for old players, so if your battery dies..... buy a new one. a competitor (A**le) still supports even 1st gen ipod batteries.. 
Summary:. Bottom line:. Creative just doesn't care about it's customers, just the bottom line. So I can imagine if a creative player had some hardware issue or malfunction, and you had to contact customer support, you may just get the sales team again instead.. 

$$;
Pros:. I wanted to like this player even after I read several negative reviews on CNET and Amazon. I liked the FM radio and I have an older Zen that has always worked great.. 
Cons:. Terrible customer support, player froze shortly after I received it.. 
Summary:. I charged the player Wednesday night and Thursdaywhen I went to load some files, the screen was black and it would not turn off. I found the Customer Service phone number on an Amazon review and called - but of course they close at 6 pm. I found the customer service website (no link to it from the site where you can purchase the player!) There was nothing in the Knowledge base so I E Mailed support. 1 positive - I had a response the next morning. Unfortunately the response was cryptic at best. It gave me a link and told me to select certain options, but of course, they were no where to be found. I really am sad that this one did not turn out well because I love my little 2 gig Zen.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgious display with great device package design. 
Cons:. Crashes constantly so keep a paper clip and computer handy. 
Summary:. I was very impressed with the look, feel and display of this player--much better that the iPods in my view. The unit continually hands on me during start-up and while playing music and videos--which requires you to constantly reload the firmware in order to recover the devise. If you choose to ignore this posting just be sure that you have a paper clip and computer handy so you can continually reload firmware.. 

$$;
Pros:. OK when new. 
Cons:. May Explode. 
Summary:. I bought Creative Zen PMC in November 2005. It stops working last month because of the battery swelling up. I have to break the battery door to get it out. I am afraid that it will explode and contact the company.. Response from Creative:. Unfortunately, your Zen PMC is no longer in warranty. This product is ending it's service life and has been replaced with newer and more feature rich products. We are no longer maintaining PMC stock or accessories stock in either retail or repair channels.. The most that I'm going to be able to offer to you is a 20% discount on the purchase of a new product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clllllllllllllllllllllllllllll CNone. 
Cons:. Cheaply made player, feels like a pack of chicklets. 
Summary:. I have been awiaiting the arrival of the new Zen players. All I can say is what a cheaply made, piece of trash. Everytime Creative makes a new player, they ruin it with either the handles/buttons or controller. This new player feels like a pack of chicklets. I would not waste $50.00 on this player. The website makes it look good. I could not believe the cheaply made look and feel of this player. It looks like if I sit down the wrong way, the headphone jack will snap in half. I am disappointed and will start looking into other players. Get out of the MP3 race. I owned 2 previous Creative players that are years old. They are a lot better made. I am going to try to send a letter to the corporate office. This player needs to be encased in something stronger than a chicklet box.. Signed. Disappointed Again..
