you/PRP would/MD hear/VB some/DT of/IN this/DT noise/NN if/IN your/PRP$ room/NN faces/VBZ that/IN street/NN but/CC my/PRP$ room/NN faced/VBD the/DT back/NN of/IN the/DT hotel/NN and/CC for/IN most/JJS of/IN my/PRP$ week-long/JJ stay/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD quiet/JJ ./.

this/DT makes/VBZ for/IN a/DT noisy/JJ environment/NN ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT front/NN of/IN the/DT hotel/NN ,/, which/WDT faces/VBZ down/RP grafton/NN street/NN with/IN its/PRP$ rows/NNS of/IN bars/NNS and/CC hundreds/NNS of/IN patrons/NNS standing/VBG in/IN the/DT street/NN and/CC drinking/NN throughout/IN the/DT evening/NN ./.

they/PRP were/VBD very/RB responsive/JJ and/CC after/IN deciding/VBG it/PRP was/VBD not/RB coming/VBG from/IN grafton/NN street/NN ,/, came/VBD up/RP to/TO my/PRP$ room/NN to/TO check/VB it/PRP out/RP ./.

i/LS probably/RB would/MD have/VB appreciated/VBN the/DT westbury/NN even/RB more/RBR if/IN i/FW had/VBD not/RB stayed/VBN first/RB at/IN the/DT elegant/JJ ,/, historic/JJ -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC much/JJ quieter/NN -RRB-/-RRB- shelbourne/VBP a/DT few/JJ blocks/NNS away/RB ./.

soundproofing/NN from/IN the/DT hallway/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC rooms/NNS on/IN lower/JJR floors/NNS have/VBP windows/NNS that/WDT face/VBP directly/RB into/IN other/JJ buildings/NNS in/IN the/DT back/NN or/CC onto/IN grafton/NN street/NN in/IN the/DT front/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB noisy/JJ ./.

breakfast/NN was/VBD above/JJ average/NN with/IN a/DT buffet/NN of/IN fruit/NN ,/, yogurt/NN and/CC breads/NNS and/CC a/DT variety/NN of/IN made-to-order/JJ egg/NN dishes/NNS that/WDT were/VBD very/RB well/RB prepared/VBN ./.

my/PRP$ room/NN had/VBD plenty/NN of/IN lighting/NN ,/, a/DT large/JJ desk/NN and/CC comfortable/JJ easy/JJ chairs/NNS ./.

however/RB ,/, the/DT dining/NN room/NN was/VBD unpleasantly/RB crowded/VBN at/IN breakfast/NN most/JJS of/IN the/DT week/NN because/IN of/IN a/DT large/JJ pharmaceutical/JJ company/NN convention/NN ./.

however/RB ,/, on/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ night/NN ,/, a/DT loud/JJ ,/, thumping/VBG drumbeat/NN from/IN a/DT party/NN on/IN another/DT street/NN continued/VBD past/JJ 1:00/CD am/VBP until/IN i/FW called/VBN the/DT front/JJ desk/NN ./.

there/EX was/VBD a/DT tub/NN with/IN rain/NN shower/NN but/CC no/DT separate/JJ shower/NN stall/VBP so/RB entering/VBG and/CC exiting/VBG the/DT shower/NN required/VBN climbing/VBG over/IN a/DT high/JJ tub/NN ./.
