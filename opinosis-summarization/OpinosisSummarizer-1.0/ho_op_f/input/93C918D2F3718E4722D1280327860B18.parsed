i/LS should/MD start/VB with/IN the/DT worst/JJS feature/NN :/: the/DT breakfast/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT worst/JJS breakfasts/NNS that/WDT i/FW have/VBP experienced/VBN in/IN many/JJ decades/NNS of/IN international/JJ travel/NN ./.

i/LS see/VB all/PDT the/DT rave/VBP reviews/NNS on/IN tripadviser/NN from/IN people/NNS who/WP were/VBD at/IN weddings/NNS here/RB and/CC i/FW can/MD only/RB say/VB that/IN they/PRP either/DT had/VBD a/DT special/JJ breakfast/NN -/: or/CC maybe/RB slept/VBD through/IN it/PRP !/.

cereal/NN options/NNS are/VBP :/: cornflakes/NNS ;/: coco/NN pops/VBZ or/CC weetabix/NN ./.

toast/NN -LRB-/-LRB- when/WRB you/PRP eventually/RB get/VB it/PRP -RRB-/-RRB- was/VBD from/IN very/RB cheap/JJ bread/NN ./.

cooked/VBN breakfast/NN served/VBD from/IN heated/JJ pans/NNS :/: poor/JJ quality/NN sausages/bacon/NN ;/: eggs/NNS can/MD be/VB hard-boiled/JJ or/CC very/RB rubbery/JJ scrambled/VBD egg/NN -/: the/DT tomatoes/NNS and/CC beans/NNS were/VBD harmless/JJ ./.

milk/NN full/JJ fat/NN only/RB ./.

coffee/NN in/IN jugs/NNS on/IN hot/JJ plate/NN -/: and/CC there/EX for/IN some/DT time/NN !/.

no/DT fresh/JJ fruit/NN or/CC fruit/NN salad/NN ,/, just/RB tinned/JJ peaches/NNS in/IN syrup/NN ./.

staff/NN were/VBD enthusiastic/JJ and/CC tried/VBD to/TO be/VB helpful/JJ but/CC were/VBD hopelessly/RB disorganised/JJ ./.

when/WRB we/PRP first/RB checked/VBD into/IN our/PRP$ room/NN ,/, it/PRP felt/VBD damp/JJ but/CC any/DT smell/NN was/VBD overpowered/VBN by/IN a/DT scent-dispenser/NN on/IN full/JJ blast/NN in/IN the/DT hallway/NN ./.

once/RB we/PRP had/VBD turned/VBN it/PRP off/RP ,/, you/PRP could/MD smell/VB the/DT musty/JJ smell/NN ./.

i/LS 'm/VBP not/RB sure/JJ whether/IN this/DT was/VBD just/RB poor/JJ ventilation/NN in/IN the/DT bathroom/NN -/: the/DT mirror/NN quickly/RB got/VBD steamed/VBN up/RB and/CC did/VBD n't/RB clear/JJ for/IN some/DT time/NN -/: but/CC i/FW think/VBP it/PRP was/VBD actually/RB rising/VBG damp/JJ ./.

no/DT apparent/JJ mould/NN on/IN walls/NNS ,/, carpet/NN or/CC bed/NN ./.

we/PRP also/RB found/VBD very/RB quickly/RB that/IN the/DT walls/NNS were/VBD incredibly/RB thin/JJ and/CC that/IN when/WRB our/PRP$ neighbours/NNS switched/VBN on/IN something/NN they/PRP had/VBD plugged/VBN into/IN a/DT socket/NN ,/, it/PRP felt/VBD like/IN they/PRP were/VBD in/IN the/DT room/NN with/IN us/PRP ./.

thankfully/RB ,/, they/PRP must/MD have/VB just/RB fallen/VBN into/IN bed/NN when/WRB they/PRP got/VBD in/IN that/DT evening/NN or/CC we/PRP would/MD certainly/RB have/VB been/VBN kept/VBN awake/RB ./.

a/DT few/JJ small/JJ things/NNS :/: when/WRB the/DT tea-making/NN facilities/NNS were/VBD topped/VBN up/RP ,/, they/PRP forgot/VBD to/TO replenish/VB the/DT plastic/NN milk/NN servings/NNS ./.

they/PRP also/RB took/VBD away/RP our/PRP$ 1-day-old/JJ soap/NN -LRB-/-LRB- which/WDT i/FW thought/VBD a/DT bit/NN wasteful/JJ -/: but/CC then/RB did/VBD n't/RB give/VB us/PRP a/DT new/JJ one/CD ,/, either/CC !/.

they/PRP also/RB managed/VBD to/TO double-book/VB us/PRP ,/, once/RB on/IN the/DT groupon/NN voucher/NN and/CC once/RB as/IN a/DT credit/NN card/NN booking/NN ./.

positives/NNS ?/.

the/DT staff/NN tried/VBD hard/JJ and/CC were/VBD very/RB pleasant/JJ ./.

they/PRP were/VBD happy/JJ to/TO recommend/VB a/DT pub/NN for/IN a/DT pub/NN meal/NN -/: the/DT fox/NN and/CC hounds/NNS in/IN lyng/NN -/: but/CC actually/RB we/PRP wished/VBD we/PRP had/VBD tried/VBN the/DT hotel/NN restaurant/NN as/IN the/DT fox/NN and/CC hounds/NNS served/VBD imaginative/JJ menus/NNS but/CC woefully/RB overcooked/JJ vegetables/NNS and/CC fish/NN drowned/VBD in/IN oil/NN ./.

other/JJ positive/JJ points/NNS about/IN the/DT hotel/NN were/VBD that/IN the/DT beer/NN -LRB-/-LRB- adnams/JJ southwold/JJ bitter/JJ -RRB-/-RRB- was/VBD good/JJ and/CC they/PRP had/VBD a/DT good/JJ range/NN of/IN malt/NN whiskies/NNS ./.

the/DT weddings/NNS that/IN we/PRP saw/VBD on/IN the/DT friday/NNP and/CC saturday/NNP nights/NNS looked/VBD to/TO be/VB enjoyed/VBN by/IN those/DT who/WP were/VBD there/EX :/: other/JJ reviewers/NNS seem/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT hotel/NN manages/VBZ weddings/NNS well/RB ,/, which/WDT astonishes/VBZ me/PRP ,/, given/VBN their/PRP$ inability/NN to/TO either/CC cook/NN or/CC serve/VB breakfast/NN ./.

we/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB back/RB !/.
