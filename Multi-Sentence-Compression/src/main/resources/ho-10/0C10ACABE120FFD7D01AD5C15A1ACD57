there is a garden in back but it was ( when we were there ) not the weather for it .
this might well be consider a suite but not in the sense you would expect and definitely for 2 adults , traveling as friends , one had to do the cot like bed and the other the big bed .
the cost for the b*b was certainly much less than the others and on that , it was good value but just read this alongside the others to see if it seems like a place for you .
it is built in next to the closet and so when you open , it opens like a closet and then when you shut , it really does n't shut .
we sat down with one of the people working at the hotel , not the two owners , and she went through on a ipad , as everyone described , things to do .
we had booked a 'suite ' and here really is where most of my critique is going to be centred -- the room .
so firstly , the positives , the b & b is situated in a really good part of town .
also the suggestions for restaurants geared toward really basic , family fare and no offers of something a little more trendy or interesting .
so many folks wrote about the amazing hospitality and i think this needs to be toned down a bit as the expectations were a bit too high for us .
the room had a bed and then what was essentially a cot -- a single bed that was put in the room .
