located 10 min drive from the airport , the resort has 3 beaches , fronting a coral reef bay .
we had a family apartment that could handle 2 adults and 3 kids ( already a big plus to have such an option , when you have 5 in a family ) .
rooms are very spacious , separate rooms for kids and adults , with separate baths and a large balcony/sit-out area ( depending if first floor or ground floor ) .
well stocked with amenities and very well maintained rooms .
free wifi in rooms .
no wifi signal at the restaurants ( which some may agree is a good thing ) .
we had planned a shorter stay , but liked the resort so much that we extended by a couple of days .
amazing range of activities for kids and adults , all free - kayaking , snorkeling ( no need to get your masks/fins - you get them ) , water-ski ( great patient coaches for first timers ) , plus multiple land sports i .
e .
tennis , golf , gym . . .
the list goes on .
a wonderful kids club with a superb set of staff that have a plan for every day and take great care of the kids .
one of the 3 beaches works for swimming/snorkeling , the other for water sports , and the third has high waves .
snorkeling sites are just off the beach , and done easily .
the yacht club staff are professional and friendly .
there 's a convenience store on site , or you could drive up to the petrol station near the airport for provisions - about 10 min away ( there 's also a supermarket next to the bunk ) .
we tried 2 restaurants - the larger breakfast buffet and the poolside restaurant at the far end of the property .
breakfast spreads are large , however can get repetitive after a week , as the breakfast menu ( including hot food ) really does n't change , we noticed .
the other restaurant has a wide range of international and local food , with a varying menu every day .
the hotel is also a nice location to see a variety of birds and fruit bats .
loved the place , as you can make out from this review .
