 as always, the video screen is sharp and bright .

2, inch screen   and a glossy, polished aluminum finish that one cnet editor described as looking like a christmas tree ornament .

 still, video fans should consider stepping up to a product with a larger screen, such as the zune hd   or ipod touch .

2, inch screen can now display up to 12 lines of menu text   and the now playing screen lists artist, album, and title information in three bolder, more readable lines at the top of the screen .

 apple's iconic click wheel navigation can still be found on the front of the device, just below the curved glass screen .

 it looks great, is easy to handle, the screen is a good size and nice and clear, and the controls are very sensitive to the touch .

 and the 5th generation has a larger screen size than the previous models .

 i've owned all the ipod nanos at one point and i can honestly say that i love the screen as it's good for causal viewing of a movie or show .

 however, it doesn't have the touch screen capability .

 it's really amazing just how big the screen is on such an incredibly thin device .

 the picture on the small screen is surprisingly clear and easy to view .

5g lies a more mature ipod, many steps wiser and more able than its one, year, old  the ipod gains many incremental improvements, including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing price points of $249 for the 30gb version and $349 for the huge 80gb version   .

 new features like lager screen and radio is a major plus  .

 the screen and built in speaker  .

 the screen is easy to read and the built in speaker works well .

 the larger screen is a great plus .

 don't waste your money on those 200 dollar itouches or the new version of the zune that is touchscreen and isn't even as good as the 5th generation nano !

video, motion sensing, screen size and sllek look  i recently upgraded from the 2nd generation nano and love the new features of the newest model .

 easy to use  this new ipod is easy to use, has great features like a radio, and a nice screen .

 good features, small and light weight but a big screen .

 the video camera is great and the screen size is a nice size

 does do much in a very tiny space, bigger screen, , more features than previous models  .

 there are alot of new features in this model and a much larger screen .

 screen scratches easily  wanted an ipod to listen to in the car .

 has bigger screen, video camera  .

 what i also like is that it has a bigger screen than the regular ipod nano .

 i found a lovely cheapo case with screen protection on amazon, and i think the gift worked out great .

 the screen is bigger so i can watch movies .

 i love the camra, and the larger screen, and the radio  .

 good screen quality  bought as a bday gift and they love it .

 i couldnt think of a single thing  this ipod is reallly great you can shoot videos listen to the radio plus you have 16 gigs of memory it is aweosme i really love it because its still as small as the last one only with a bigger screen and great color

 slim, size, vedio camera, screen clarity, photo playing mode  .

 what's more, even if i cut a long essay into chips with 5k binary limit for each one, some of them may still be unreadable through the note reader since the wheel just simply doesn't work out to scroll the screen down .

 price, size, screen, fm radio, camera, capacity, scroll wheel, pedometer  .

 the battery is great and the screen as well .

 the larger screen is a plus for sure .

 screen resolution is awesome .

 lack of a belt clip accessory that also protects the screen .

 the only negative thing i would say is that i cannot find a sleeve coverwith a belt clip like i had for my 2nd gen, it was neoprene and protected the screen and thumb wheel .

 easy to use video camera, big screen, fun color  .

 also the screen i love how big it and, how easy you can read the playlist the color rocks !

 screen does not scratch, but can get fingerprints easily .

 very easy to use, love the pedometer, lightweight, thin, nice screen, great sound, battery lasts much longer than stated  .

but i'm really disappointed they didn't keep the same finish as last year's matte finish, last year's model never got fingerprints, except on the screen itself, and looked new at all times .

 nice size screen, good speakers for size, great new features, tons of colors to choose from, easy to use .

 video is impressive, speaker sound is good for size, easy menus, screen is big enough to watch movies .

 watched one last night in bed while mrs was sleeping and screen is big enough .

 the old nano stuff fits but no openings for camera lens & this screen a bit larger .

 new features, bigger screen .

 now all it needs is a camera that can take still pics, maybe a bigger screen, a built in antenna, and internet   buy it if you're looking for a good ipod !

 small size and color, gettin your money's worth, nice screen, and video camera  .

 same as last model with some differences in screen size a 2 .

 the mic and camera are great, speaker is great for video playback or bedtime movie watching, the screen is now even bigger and the device is the same size but lighter than the 4th gen nano !

 if these get much smaller, though, i won't be able to read the screen .

 it's small and lightweight, it looks amazing, the video quality is way better than i ever imagined it would be, and the screen is huge .

 i like the fm radio, have an audio book and even downloaded a movie on it, , small screen but is watchable .

i bought the nano as a replacement for an older classic, which was a great unit but time has taken it's toll on the battery and screen .

this is a vast improvement on the last nano, with a bigger screen and more capacity .
