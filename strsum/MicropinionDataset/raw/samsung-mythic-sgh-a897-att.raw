Cons:. i have no dislikes. 
Summary:. for the price and simplictity of the phone i give it an A plus plus,,,,,the camera and pictures are great also!.

Pros:. 3.2 mp camera with good flash,. great touchscreen responsiveness,. 3.5 mm headphone jack. loud and clear speaker. good call quality. 3 'desktop' pages. customizable,. widgets,. holds up to 16 gb memory card. very responsive virtual keyboard. 
Cons:. text messages automatically save to the sim card. 
Summary:. i bought this phone after reading plenty of reviews and doing research. so far it's everything i could ask for in a phone. i unlocked it to use with t-mobile, and the call quality is great. i love the touchscreen, as it is very responsive. it requires a little bit of pressure, so it is not as sensitive to the touch as the iphone. i find this is a very good feature because it means that you don't press random keys by mistake. it is very easy to get used to. texting on this phone is a breeze. its t9 serves as an auto correct in qwerty mode, so if you're typing fast, it automatically corrects any mistakes. so you get barely any typos. it is a very smart feature that doesnt get in the way. the period, comma, and question marks are available on the abc and numerical screen when texting, so u dont have to go back and forth between abc and symbols. the camera takes pretty good pics. it's auto focus works pretty well for a phone. it also has a blinding flash that you can enable or disable easily, along with many cool picture options such as frames and mosaics, so u can get really creative. it also includes a smile shot, and panoramic picture option which is really cool. you can even edit pictures right on your phone, so if you like the picture but the brightness or contrast is a little off you can change it right there on the phone. you can even warp, rotate, blur, crop, and add cool little frames, clip arts, emoticons, and text. this can keep anyone entertained for hours. the sound is very loud and clear. you can listen to music on it without any distortions. you can even have it playing in the background as you text or navigate menus, etc. the 3.5 mm jack is a great feature so u can listen to your music anywhere.the widgets are pretty cool, and very customizable. you can even customize your 3 main menus very easily. its charger is a micro usb, so u can charge it with a computer as well. it has a cool little bar which displays any texts, missed calls, emails, IMs, voicemails, and missed events, right on the main screen. the screen is beautiful and shows crisp colorful images without a sweat. also you can have as many alarms as u like, which is a plus for me (that way you dont have to change them constantly, just add a new one) you can set it to ring at specific days of the week, and also you can snooze it up to 10 times(most people dont do this but if you wanted to you could) and you can set the interval between each snooze.i recently added internet to my t-mobile plan, so i cant use it until next month, so i cant really comment on its internet performance.. another feature i really like is that anytime you press something on the screen, it gives a little vibrate, which is really cool, because it kind of feels like you're pressing an actual button(you can turn this feature off if you don't like it though, which is cool too if you dont want that). The one thing i don't like about this phone is that when you send or receive a text message, it automatically saves them to your sim card, which means it can get full fairly fast and you woud have to move them or delete them after a while. (you can still receive texts even if the im is full, because then it saves to your phone, but a little dialogue box comes up every few minutes) it's not a big deal really, and i still love the phone, i just wish i would have read about this beforehand.. all in all i am very happy for my purchase and adore my new phone. good luck, and i hope this helps.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone has a great music and video player!! It has a 3.5 headphone jack which is awesome!!! The screen is vibrant and the organization of the phone is almost smartphone-like!!. 
Cons:. It has resistive touchscreen! It also lags a lot, but its ok. The cover art in the music player doesn't show up very big, but its ok. You cant control the pics on the lockscreen!!!. 
Summary:. If data plans r just too expensive for u, this is the best possible phone u can get!! I use this phone a lot for music everyday and I also watch a LOT of videos and it is GREAT for a media/entertainment person. Even the internet surfing speed is good. The camera has a very bright flash and overall, this is probably the best feature phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, a lot of customization. 
Cons:. no keyboard. 
Summary:. I just picked up my Samsung Mythic last week and I am quite eager to learn a thing or two.. Last phone that I modded was the Razr and that has bee quite some time ago. I'm enjoying the Samsung Mythic thus far and will probably start making wallpapers and ringtones in the near future. You can check out my wallpapers at http://www.Samsung-Mythic.com take care.. 

$$;
Pros:. cool features, big screen, camera with flash and so on..... 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. Great phone at great price. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to move around the different screens and menus, very user friendly. Choice of text messaging styles and affordable data plans. Easy to sync with gmail and other email services. Good call quality.. 
Cons:. Lacking accessories at this point, such as cases cut to fit the phone, not just generic cases. I'm sure this will improve over time.. 
Summary:. Great phone for a great price. Web browser works great, good camera for a phone. The reviews complaining about lagging must not have calibrated the phone. The AT&#38;T rep set up my phone in the store while I was waiting for numbers to transfer to another phone and I have had no problems. All transitions are smooth.. 

$$;
Pros:. We bought this for our college-age son, now ATT has a buy one get one free offer---got a second one. My wife loves the touch keypad for texting. 
Cons:. as with all smartphones, I wish the apps were ALL free. 
Summary:. Great phone---cool looks easy, intuitive use. 

$$;
Pros:. 3.2 mpxl camera, touch screen interface, navigation a breeze, widgets including AT&#38;T Mobile TV, AT&#38;T Navigation. 
Cons:. None whatsoever!. 
Summary:. I was going to follow the "trend" of purchasing an iPhone when it was time for my upgrade, but instead of spending $150 for that, this phone was offerd for free so after reading reviews I jumped at the offer. I received the phone and I have been thrilled ever since (I upgraded from a full QWERTY keyboard Motorola Q global). The virtual keyboard is easy to use and I very rarely mistype, none more than I used to with my old phone. The widgets are fantastic, and he 3.2 MP camera works very well and has a flash which is a nice touch. I do not agree with the previous reviewer who said that the phone has lagging issues, as I have had absolutely no problems navigating through each screen, widget, etc. My husband and I are very happy with my purchase, so much so that now my husband is looking to upgrade to this phone also in January since he has seen mine!. 

$$;
Pros:. Camera flash, separate headset jack(new for Samsung who previously used the charger port as a headset jack), Voice dialing, easy to use menus, great speaker, good call quality, light...not bulky. 
Cons:. None as of yet. 
Summary:. I bought this phone last week when I upgraded my AT&#38;T plan and I love it. I was a little wary at first since my last phone had a dedicated QWERTY keyboard (BlackJack2)and a non touch screen interface. But I took the leap. I had to recalibrate the virtual keboard which you should always do anyways and I never have any mistypes. The only gripe I had with the virtual keyboard is that the apostrophe key is on a separate symbol keyboard from the alphabet one(there's 3 virtual keyboards total)I use that apostrophe one alot. Other than that I am more than satisfied. I was pleased with the camera flash since my lasst phone didn't have that. Camera quality is good although the colors are a tad washed out but Samsung seems to have that issue on all of their phones. Its better than most though. I have no trouble navigating the 3 menu screens or the 3 home screens. I am also very pleased with the speaker quality and volume since the blackjack2 didn't have a very good speaker. So far every call I've made is very loud and clear. But I haven't made any crazy calls to weird areas so we'll see how that goes later on. I like the fact that you can customize the little widget bar on the lefthand side of the screem to add or remove the widgets that you don't use or don't want showing. I haven't changed my plan yet to be able to utilize the mobile tv apps but I will soon. I'm curious as to how that particular part of the phone does. The 3G network in my area is also not that great so it won't really be able to utilize it to its fullest. All in all I am very happy with the Samsung Mythic and I would definitely recommend it to a friend or anyone really. I have only had it about a week so that might change later on...but for now...LOVE IT!!! I hope this helps anyone looking to buy this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice touch screen size. High Resolution screen really high. Flash its very bright. 
Cons:. Some girly Lock Screens. Battery Life is unimpressive. Creaky Back Cover. 
Summary:. I ended up getting this phone from warranty and love it, theres just a couple of minor problems,but overall its outstanding. There is one thing i would like to point out i the review, i don't know if there were some duds, but i never have any slowdown in my phones UI. The touch screen is large and responsive, and so is the onscreen keyboard.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good keyboard. Touchscreen OK. Amazing camera. Good videos. Music player is awesome. 
Cons:. *Can't change background of unlock/lock. 
Summary:. This is an amazing phone f or anybody! I love it there is nothing really that bad about it! I recommend this phone for anybody! :). 

$$;
Pros:. Touchscreen, lots of apps, web friendly, great downsize phone from my smartphone.. 
Cons:. Touchscreen is a bit slow and unresponsive sometimes. I can't seem to figure out how to use Google Calendar, which is VERY annoying!. 
Summary:. This is my first touchscreen phone and I was leery because of it. I looked at the Soltice and Impression by Samsung, but also the Motorola Karma and Pantech. I had not been a huge fan of Samsung, having owned Motorola, Nokia and husband has had a string of every new iphone (which is what he thought I should get). My main motivation was that I wanted to ditch ATT's $30 a month smartphone fee when I didn't use any of the features. The main utility features I was looking for included good call quality, ability to IM and text, and to check email now and then. I wanted a camera, but didn't care about video or sound (and still don't).. After now owning the phone for two weeks, I feel confident that I've worked with it enough to know what is good and what isn't so hot. The touchscreen, as previously complained, is a bit on the dull side in terms of responsiveness. Sometimes I have no problem, other times it either won't move when I flick it across, or I end up selecting something I don't want. I fully agree this could be a problem with the operator! The camera is not very intuitive. I still haven't figured out how to zoom in or out. It does take nice pics, and they are in jpeg format so they are easy to share (as opposed to my last phone).. In terms of text and IM, I am still on the learning curve of not screwing up the keystrokes on the touchscreen without making a lot of spelling mistakes. It helps to have fingernails, so I'm not sure how a man would feel about the buttons that way.. I REALLY wish that I could figure out how to have Google Calendar send my schedule to my phone. If I could work out that kink, I'd be unequivocably happy.. Overall a very good phone and a pleasant surprise.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like that it has all the laterst features like iPhone. I especially like that a data plan is not required.. 
Cons:. New as of January 2010, not many accessories available in stores.. 
Summary:. For the price, it is the best phone for basic browing of web, emails and keeping in-touch through social networking sites.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Samsung Mythic offers a large bright screen, highly customizable menus, great clarity, great features. Samsung has the decency to include software and a connection cable.. 
Cons:. Can't change the lock/unlock wallpaper, vibration isn't as intense as it could be.. 
Summary:. First off as a telephone, (remember when that was the prime reason to have one of these?), it has outstanding performance. The clarity on both ends of the call is quite crisp and has a good volume. It is easy to do extensive customizing of the contacts list. Some have complained that you can't port your contacts from outlook, but for the casual user I don't think this is a problem. Some have also complained that the touch screen and menus are sluggish, I think people are trying to compare this to the iphone or ipod touch screens. I don't think this is a fair comparison. For me the screen reacts as well as most any other non smart phone with a touch screen. Any problems can be easily solved with a simple stylus available from any number of sources for less than 5 dollars. The keys on the virtual qwerty pad are large and easy to use. I first tried an LG Xenon and found it nearly impossible to use with my fat fingers. I can finally actually make the most of my texting plan. The camera functions well and comes with a flash. I can't speak to the web or tv service on the phone as I have elected not to purchase the plans to use those features. In every sense this is the best non-smart phone I have ever owned. Perhaps one of the best things about this phone is the accessory package in the box. I have in the past been frustrated by companies that required me to buy expensive software and connection cables to link up to my computer. With this phone it is all included. The software makes it a breeze to transfer photos, music, and ringtones to and from the phone. This is a huge bonus if you have ever struggled to figure out how to do these functions without spending another 75 bucks. It is quite stylish and sleek, coming in only one color, but in the age of cases of all styles and colors this is hardly worth mentioning. I only took 1/2 star off this phone for the fact that one cannot change the lock mode screensavers. The phone will cycle through the preloaded wallpapers. I solve this by pretty much not locking my phone routinely. The second reason for the loss of half a star is the vibration. The vibration on this phone doesn't go as high in intensity as others I have owned. It is a slight drawback, but nothing to really detract from the many great features available on this phone. I have already recommended it to anyone I know who is looking for a new non-smart phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone is vary attractive and stylish. Looks high end with productivity to back it up. Call quality is excellent but could use a higher call volume. Good preloaded ring tones. Love the brower. Love the dark maroon pattarn on the pack.. 
Cons:. Call volume is low. For someone with hearing issues, you should probably due further evaluation on the phone to see if the other features make up for the lack of volume(for me it did). Transition from app to app was sluggish.. 
Summary:. The bottom line is the phone is excellent even though the app transition is sluggish. There are so many other great things about this phone that make the sluggishness worth dealing with. Call quality is around the best you can get and I have had many phones. I went from the Verizon Voyager to this phone. I was vary happy with the Voyager so the Mythic had high expectations to meet. The Mythis did it with success. Needs more text message alert opptions, there are only five that come with it. 

$$;
Pros:. large 3.3" touch screen. Widgets. Mobile Tv. Gps. Good Sound Quality. 
Cons:. Sluggish at times on internet. 
Summary:. I love this phone! I got it 2 weeks ago and I am really happy with my choice. I wanted an iPhone but wasn't willing to spend $30 on a data plan each month and I think this is a great substitution if you don't want a large phone bill. The internet was a little sluggish at times but the rest is GREAT. I really urge you to buy this phone if you want a large touch scree, tons of apps and widgets, good call quality and so much more!. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the camera quality and the fact that it comes with a flash. I also like the very slim an sleek design of the phone. The widget bar is very handy and I also really like and the size of the screen, it makes it very easy to use.. 
Cons:. I really wish it would have a louder ring volume. If I have the phone in my purse or Im driving an have the radio on even if its not loud I cant seem to hear the phone ring even if the ringer volume is up as loud as it will go.. 
Summary:. I like the phone alot an its my favorite phone ive ever owned an believe me ive owned several different ones.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to read, opens most web pages quickly sound quality and clarity, comfortable to use, ease of texting, battery life, volume of ringtones and music, dedicated 3.5mm speaker plug. 
Cons:. locked picture screens, needs more apps available, screen is a fingerprint magnet, inability to arrange menu icons to my liking, locked apps and programs (inability to remove). 
Summary:. Over all, I personally love my phone! The calls are always clear and crisp. The music plays great for a cell phone. I do recommend a case and screen protector however. I have a bum hand from a stroke and that makes it easier to hold. The screen shows both fingerprints and the oil from your face really bad. I don't text a lot, but having the touchpad qwerty keyboard makes it a lot easier. The keypad takes a little getting used to, but most new items do. I like this phone over my wife's Impression by far. But I don't text like she does. I highly recommend this phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. User interface and display are great. 
Cons:. Typing to some time to perfect. 
Summary:. Great phone for a great price - easy to use and durable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very responsive resistive screen.. Sleek and light weight design. Good browser. Multiple home screens. $30 unlimited data and messaging package. Voice commands. Customizable menus. Nice Samsung keyboard. Camera with flash. 3.5 mm headphone jack. 
Cons:. Cannont acces windows live without paying $5 monthly mobile email 3.0 fee. A bit slow to transition between screens. Cannot change lock screen wallpapers. Headset could be louder. Cant access some apps without having to go to a sub menu. Lack of Apps. 
Summary:. Overall I am very satisfied with this phone. Being my first touchscreen phone I did alot of reasearch and ended up having to mess around with and choose between the HTC Pure and the Samsung Mythic at the AT&#38;T store. I went with the Mythic because of its 3.5 mm jack, easier to use keyboard, and lower price of data plan.. The touch screen is quiet responsive and easy to get a hang of. As of Samsung's Touchwiz UI, well it's not a smartphone and is not designed to be one. So gettting around and organized on the Mythic is not the best experience, but then again I am no business man. Other than that it's simple and fun to use. A feature i really liked was that from your lock screen you can see at a glance if you have any new messages, calls, emails, and social network updates.. The Camera has a LED flash which is very bright and usefull. (PS if you need a flashlight just start recording a video) The media player is simple and easy to use once you add your files to folders in the phone through the computer. It's more organized than adding data to the SD card then inserting into the phone.. The App selection in the AT&#38;T store is dismal and dissapointing. I'll just stick to surfing the web and music to pass time. On that note the Web Browser which is based off Opera is a very nice and capable browser. By the way Nicole Lee I mean no offense but the browser does have multiple zoom settings. (Just hold your finger down on the screen until you see two arrows then move you finger up to zoom in and down to zoom out.). No ones fualt but I suppose they dont send ship new phones with user manuels I had to finger that out myself. Also mobile web and the browser are not the same thing. To get to the browser go to the Apps icon on you menu.. For some reason you cannot sign into your windows live account to check your e-mail without subscribing to AT&#38;T's mobile e-mail 3.0 service which is an extra $5 monthly. I found this dissapointing but it's still cheaper than paying an iPhone data plan or other smartphone data plan.. Battery life is pretty good I've spent the greater part of a 24 hour day web browsing, texting, and am now listening to music and have only worked through 1/5 bars. O yes my probably biggest gripe with this phone is that when you light up the then screen while locked it randomly goes through pictures that you cannot change. The pictures are nice and bright which show off the screens array of colors and sharpness but i'm not a big fan of having flowers and butterflies as my background. I can only hope samsung addresses this later.. Overall this a great "multimedia" phone. This phone plays its role very well and then some. AT&#38;T's social net is great for keeping up with myspace facebook and twitter simultaneously, but AT&#38;T or Samsung needs to bring out some more apps. If you reallly seek productivity or just really dont care about prices then go ahead and spend the extra cash.. 

$$;
Pros:. Browser is excellent. Slim and sleek.. 
Cons:. PC interface offers little for contacts or calendar. Not an email device, like a RIM product.. 
Summary:. Great if you want good browser functionality, music, but dont need the apps offered in a smartphone, and/or not willing to pay for smartphone service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bought this really for the 3.5mm head phone jack and using as a music player.. I also like the landscape mode for texting, I have not had any problems that are. mentioned in other reviews. I also like the camera and pic quality.. 
Cons:. None really as of yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. *Sleek look. *Touch screen. *Included ringtones are decent. *Battery time is decent (I used the phone constantly for SEVERAL hours before needing a recharge.). *3.2mp camera with flash. *Video (including video share). 
Cons:. *No threading of text conversations. *No individual ringtone assignment for texts. *No options for changing locked screen wallpaper. *Sluggish navigation at times. *Handwriting "feature" falls short. *Too few apps. *Only available in burgundy color. 
Summary:. This a giant step up from my Motorola Razr. And I do like this phone. It's sleek, the touch screen is nice, texting is much faster with the QWERTY touch keypad, the camera is good, and overall I am happy with it at this point.. However, Samsung came ___ this close to creating an exceptional phone. Had they chosen to spend just a little more time in development they would have had a product to rival the iPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the 3 mains screnes.. I like the camera and video recorder.. I really enjoy the texting, find it easy even with big fingers.. Easy to understand.. Dont have to have the internet package.. 
Cons:. I dont like not being able to change the lock/unlock background.. It lags from screne to screne.. Sometimes I have problems hearing on the phone.. The ticking it makes when you turn it everytime.. 
Summary:. Good phone, well worth the money. Friends have other new phones and mines the best, thats all their oppions not just mine.. Updated. on Jan 15, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Facebook and Myspace shortcuts, 3.2MP camera w/ flash, GPS, Super colorfull display and a well designed user interface. 
Cons:. Only comes in a burgandy color, even though at&#38;t's website lists it as black. scrolling through menus can be a bit sluggish, a sometimes stubburn touch response makes clicking on icons a pain. 
Summary:. One of the better new phones to come out for at&#38;t this year. There's a lot of iPhone like features Like movable home screen icons, Facebook shortcuts and is compatible with at&#38;t's 15 dollar data package so you won't be going broke checking your email. Ultra colorful display and a easy UI. It's a bit sluggish and stubburn when it comes to the touch response and applications and I was kinda bummed to find out the phone only comes in a red (burgandy) color. at&#38;t has to correct that on their site. All in all really cool phone. 

$$;
Pros:. Smaller than an iphone. Internet and texting is cheap. Sim card and memory card are a plus. Password locks for folders. Cons:. Wigets might be cool, but they are all monthly contract fees with them.. Cant make your own ringtones!. 
Cons:. Cant copy and paste in texts or internet. Cant zoom on camera. Cant change screensaver/wallpaper pictures. Cant save internet photos. Apps not useful. Touch Screen goes bad in 9 months, has to be replaced ($10 ebay). Email $5 month. Battery charge bad. color. 
Summary:. I bought this phone because I wanted to try a touch screen before I invested in an Iphone. I had been a devoted user of Sony Ericsson for a long time. I like multimedia aspects of phones (photo, video, music, etc). But this phone, everything costs to do it or its not offered. I used to be able to take my old phones to concerts and record or take photos and have it be amazing. This one, even if you were at the stage, it would look like you were in the back. And you need a memory card for it, it fills up so fast. The texts are not in chat format, so you end up with thousands of them. The widgets are pointless and I wish I could delete them to create more memory space, but you cant. I hate their ringtones and you cant make your own unless you only like a second of a song. The color would be better in black. I'm always charging the battery and I pretty much only text. Email can only be accessed for an additional $5 a month. You cant save internet photos that you have found from browsing and you cant copy and paste anything you type! The wallpaper photos are lame and you cant change them or add your own. But the one bad thing, if you aren't into fixing your own phone (because we all know At&#38;t and their policies when a phone breaks "oh you broke it, the phone would never break naturally, ill sell you a new one for more and upgrade your plan and talk you into a longer contract") the touch screen digitizer, what makes you able to touch the screen and make anything work, breaks before one year.... so keep updating your contacts on your sim card, photos/videos/texts on your memory card, and don't keep a password to get into your folders (because if you try to connect it to the computer, after the screen goes, it still wants the password that you have no place to type in). You just cant get into your phone unless you replace that part (you can receive calls or call the last person who called, if you want to go veryyyy basic for awhile). You can get the part for $10 on ebay and do it yourself.... or you can just loose any unsaved info and have them give you another eventual defect. I could see maybe a soccer mom liking this phone so she can look cool and take up close pictures of her kids, but not use any of the applications. You could by it for your teenager, but you are asking for trouble, if they start activating all the undeletable applications/widgets, your bill is going to be huge. If you just use cell phones to call and basic text, maybe check your facebook (not your email), this is fine. But if you are interactive and look at your cell phone as an extension of you and your communication and creative side, this is not the phone. Go back to the Sony Ericsson, or bite the financial bullet and buy the Iphone. Btw, the Ericsson just came out with a touch phone, when this one breaks again, I'm going to that.. 

$$;
Pros:. High Quality Samsung. 
Cons:. Expensive &#38; Not Prepaid. 
Summary:. Bottom line: Great Samsung phone, but I really wish it were prepaid - Net10 for that matter. My sister brags about how wonderful her Net10 service is and how it even has a website, Net10laughoff.com, to win a cash prize. She has a Samsung phone on this service and I was wondering if this Mythic can be available as prepaid too?. 

$$;
Pros:. texting is very easy. felt good in my hands. the camera seemed okay and the flash is a bonus. internet access was smooth. 
Cons:. some of the internet browser buttons are very small. movement through the menus was kind of sluggish. TRI-BAND!. 
Summary:. the mythic seems like a great phone. the more i messed with it the more i liked it. However, this is only a GSM triband phone. while the Mythic is the more advanced phone in nearly every way (tech-wise) the Solstice is a quad-band {WCDMA (UMTS) / GSM 850/900/1800/1900} phone. this makes no sense to me. being tri-band puts it too far behind the curve for my liking.. 

$$;
Pros:. Voice dialing and commands - I've always wanted to ask my phone what time it is. Touch screen QWERTY keyboard. MP3 player. Ringer is nice and loud for working in noisy convention centers. Does not require expensive data plans. 
Cons:. This phone is as sluggish as a teenager with a bad attitude. The unlock feature is painfully slow and the touch keyboard is slower that writing messages on stone tablets.. 
Summary:. I had to replace my favorite phone ever (Pantech C150). It broke and they don't make it anymore. I loved that phone because it was so slim and small and BASIC. The Mythic came closest in size and met my requirements of, no required data plans and must fit in my tiny purse or pocket. I simply don't need or want 99% of what the phone has on it, but the market seems to be demanding the bells and whistles, so I get them too. The TV feature is nonsense to me. I watch shows on my 52" TV at home (I don't really do that very much either). As for the apps and browser, I wish I could just delete it all. Thankfully, I have the little widget thing that lets me access my frequent use items - music player, messaging, and memos. I just wish that touch screen was more responsive. Since I walk my dog a lot, the music player is really what drove me to this phone. Now I don't have to carry two devices. When the phone is in my pocket, I love the voice recognition. I can check time and make calls without having to touch the phone. It also transitions nicely from music to taking a call, then back to music.. NOTE on the BATTERY: Everything about the battery life seemed fine until suddenly one day it started draining really fast. I worried that I might have inadvertently started an app or the browser. I checked the manual and made sure I had hit the end button to completely stop my music player. In the end, what I discovered was that my bluetooth stays active even after I stop the music player. How did I know, you ask? I had the volume on the phone and the headset all the way up because I had been outside. When I stopped the player, I could still hear the open line through my headset. Basically, this runs down the battery as if I'm on an active phone call. Somehow the phone gives the headset a command to "end call" when you make a phone call, but it's not giving a notification when the player is ended. When I'm done listening to music and hit the end button, I now do a quick phone function like Check Time with the voice feature. This gives the headset a clear "end" command that sends it back into standby. I no longer have battery issues..

Cons:. the device has a tendency to lock-up when exiting the browser (returned the first one, second one - same problem). I have to remove the battery and restart it.. 

$$;
Pros:. battery life (from full to half), screen size, camera (in macro mode), time to charge, speakerphone volume, handset volume, ring volume, sturdy feel. 
Cons:. camera (autofocus mode), video without flash, no zoom when taking photo (can zoom after &#38; on video) 20 of the 30 icons require data/internet use (if you want a phone without data plan), can move but not delete or hide the 30 icons/apps, more to tell. 
Summary:. I purchased this phone because I wanted a camera to replace my Samsung SGH-D900 (see my review) which I sorely miss (still functional but weak signal strength). Anyways, I have had this phone since early feb (2 &#38; 1/2 months) as my 1st touch screen. Not a fan but a side of that, I HATE this phone. You can run most pix, video, MP3's from the memory card which helps but sounds/songs of any length are too large to use as ringtones, alarm tones, etc. You must compress the file in to small bits of sound. Pictures in macro mode look clear but still require the camera to focus. Other option is AF mode which takes at least 2 seconds of not moving to take a picture. You cannot take a moving object. Other camera options allow you to edit/add to the photo but your hand or the object must always be stationary. I loved Samsung for their shortcut buttons from previous phones (this model is locked with call, messaging, mobile Web, Music Player, games &#38; end all) I used Calculator, calender, new message and alarm (widgets that do not fill all on one screen). Yes, there are 3 widget screens that you can scroll thru (like iphone) they have pictures in the background. Then you have a memu button which brings you to 3 more screens (full of apps). If you buy or add more apps you may have more windows. These apps mimic some of the widgets that you can customize he 1st set of windows with. Speaking of widgets, 10 of the 32 require data use (just a warning, 3 are clocks &#38; 7 are memo pads). Confused? I was too because there are 5 ways to create a text and more than 1 way to do everything else. If you like that great, but most ways require multiple buttons so it could get confusing either way. Other rants (silent using volume toggle, sound profile mode or key pad # button), memos are limited to 100 characters (up to 100 memos too), when you lock the phone and are NOT on the main widget screen, if you receive a text/missed call/voice mail, you must back out or end all to get to the memu bar that lists the inbox/call log. Customizable vibration and vibration levels are nice but you really can't tell the difference on your hip and the highest setting is still weaker than my other samsungs. Cannot use camera flash as a flashlight, charging port is at the top, must remove back panel to access memory card, no operations manual (CD-rom provides the link to the internet which shows you how to use the phone), alarm snooze has a swivel button to turn it off but you can also shut off the alarm (accidentally) using all other buttons (volume rocker, talk, back, end, lock, camera shutter or shortcut), address book contact info (birthdays) do not merge to the calender (no option to add), cannot check a text while on the phone, phone cannot multi-task well. It will freeze up for a second if you receive a text while doing something else, but it will remember how many times you hit the button if you tried to press the buttons again when it froze. You cannot use the volume rocker to scroll down to read a long text. Volume rocker changes the font size up and down. I have old text messages from the previous phones but they are useless for dates because the phone does not display the year, only month and day the text was received. Lastly, if video resolution doesnt match the video display, you cannot view them (i.e. I can store the videos from other phones/files, but cannot view them). I could say some good about this phone like the helpful ID Bar in locked mode and the tactile vibrations when typing but I am not trying to sell this phone to anyone who is not going to use a data plan. All games and even the Web TV (a primary feature of this phone) use the demo or require data use. My bill ends up $0.50-$1.00 higher by virtue of clicking on a button/app that loads to the internet. Contact me if you want to know more but I am thoroughly frustrated on a daily basis. All I want is a phone that dials and takes good pictures with flash. This did not do it for me.

Pros:. The phone is extremely sleek and nice looking, and the idea of customizing your home screen is awesome. It has a nice camera and a very large screen. Also the headphone jack is extremely helpful.. 
Cons:. -Menu is extremely difficult to navigate, and is lacking in true personalization options.. -Touch screen isn't the best.. -Web browser only has 2x zoom screen.. 
Summary:. My biggest issues with this phone are the menu setups, and attempting to text. The Mythic had good intentions of being customizable like the iphone without needing the data plan, but it seems as if they tried too hard and made it a little too complex to find anything in those menus.. I still have yet to figure out how to change my "locked screen wallpaper" and the "sound profile" menu is pointless. I don't need different settings for "Driving or Outdoors." I want normal settings like "Vibrate, Silent, or something along those lines". Also trying to text is nearly impossible if you don't have super skinny fingers, or are trained well to touchscreen texting. The full keyboard is really close together and you mess up a lot. And there really is no messaging menu, you can go to your inbox/outbox, but if you want to make a new message, you have to exit out and find the icon wherever you decided to put in on your home screen. Again, the menus just being a little too inconvenient.. Overall, I would not chose this phone, if you like how this one looks, do yourself a favor and get the Samsung Impression instead. It's almost the same, just minus the headphone and mobile TV, and it has a physical full keyboard.. Updated. on Apr 3, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. vivid display, good camera quality, sleek design. 
Cons:. restarts randomly, refuses to call/text at random times, not very responsive to change in direction, touchscreen qwerty difficult to use, weird directional sense when viewing pictures, camera does not have zoom, texts are not in chat format. 
Summary:. I was really excited to get this phone at first. The vivid display was extremely appealing and the phone looks very sleek. However, after just 6 months, I cannot stand it anymore. I have recently switched to the LG Xenon, which is actually a less advanced phone, but it's working so much better.. The biggest 2 problems with the Mythic are that (1) it will shut off by itself and (2) refuse to call/send texts at random times.. (1) After about 3 months with the phone, the restarting thing started happening. Now it occurs no less than 5 times a day. When I push any button (unlock, call, menu,..ANYTHING), there is a chance of the phone shutting off.. (2) Also, the phone will refuse to call or send/receive any texts for intervals of up to an hour. If I try to dial, it will say "Emergency calls only." Texts just do not send. I've tried restarting my phone many times, taking out the battery and putting it back in, etc whenever this happens. Nothing helps. You just have to wait it out.. Other than these, the other problems are slightly more acceptable. The directional sense of the phone can be very irritating. It is slow to recognize that you have switched from viewing it vertically to horizontally, and vice versa. Also, the touchscreen qwerty takes some getting used to, but that goes for all touchscreen keyboards. Another small thing is that the phone has some weird directional sense when you are looking at your pictures (it assumes that every picture is taken horizontally so if you have a vertical picture, it will automatically make it horizontal, so you have to look at it sideways). Also, the camera does not have zoom, but in general the picture quality is pretty good. One last thing is that texts are not in a chat format on this phone, which most newer smart phones do.. Bottom line: I do NOT recommend this phone, especially if you're a heavy cell phone user.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ringer is loud (depending on what ring tone you have set), lots of customizable options, 3 wallpaper screens, touch screen, large screen, sleek, very user friendly and versatile calender.. 
Cons:. slow, sluggish, boring, "unexpected failure" message while trying to post a status in facebook, expensive, shuts off when trying to access certain features of my online banking, touch screen often mistypes.. 
Summary:. I've had the phone since around November 2009, and I'm on my third one, and this one is just about to get sent back as well. The first phone withstood being dropped, stuffed in my bra for over an hour at a time while I was on it using my blue tooth, and being stuffed in my purse; I was actually very impressed, until the screen started acting up. I would try to push the 3 and it would push the 2. It did this a few times and would fix itself, but it just got annoying, so I called AT&#38;T and they sent me a replacement, which was actually a refurb. Needless to say this "new" phone was sent back after less than a month because it had completely locked up on me for no reason. I got my third phone, and so far it's been okay, but it seems to have trouble recognizing what I push when I text. It either skips letters, or types the wrong ones. And the back space button will not erase, but will mistype an L. My fingers aren't that big and I have nails, so this shouldn't be a problem. The biggest problem I have with it is that it will give me an "unexpected failure" message over and over and over again when I try to post a status message on facebook. It drives me friggin' nuts. I have to hit the post button up to 10 times before it finally goes through. And I can't check my bank account at all, or the phone shuts right off. I have never had any of these problems before, not even with the MotoRazr, or the Samsung Impression. I stick with AT&#38;T because my family all has it, but I've seriously considered switching services because other providers offer better phones. In fact I think AT&#38;T seems to be at the bottom of the technology totem pole, when it comes to anything. The only thing they have going for them is the iphone, and even that has been out performed by phones running Android. Over all I think the Mythic is garbage, but it does have some good qualities, and has been good to me for the most part so far. I don't recommend this phone to anyone who does a lot of business on their phone, or anyone who is in a hurry. If you can't be patient with the phone, then you shouldn't buy it. I don't mind the "girly" unchangeable locked backgrounds, though it is annoying not being able to customize these things. And so far this is the ONLY thing I have come across that I can't customize. If I think of anything else I will add it, but for now this is all I have to say.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy layout of the phone. The Widgets are quite handy especially the messaging alerts one. The home pages makes it great for widget layout. Its slim and light weight. Takes great pictures.. 
Cons:. I dont know here to start. Reception is usually three bars or less if not in a highly populated area. Freezing of the web browser constantly. Locking wall pictures customizable. Alarm setting changes its tone and volume constantly. Sluggish at times.. 
Summary:. Well this is my third phone ever. I started with a tracfone, then I got on plan with my family and I had a RAZR. Now I'm a new plan with a friend and I received this phone. Sure its a nice upgrade from a RAZR, but once you've had it for a couple months, its not as great as you thought. It's great for size and weight, color, volume, and such, but for being in a smart phone category, it lacks severely. You can choose form just a few widgets. The web browsing on the phone is just horrible, and can constantly tell you that there is an unexpected error. Occasionally (though it seems to happen all the time) when you exit a browser, your phone will freeze, leaving the only way to turn it off by taking out the battery. I find this very frustrating. The phone also tends to have average to poor service, which becomes irritating. I must admit I love the various ways to text, and make calls, it also offers a great multi task button.The phones easy layout allows your fingers the ability to glide across it easily, and can make for speedy texting. Though the menus can become a hassle, having to got through many just to get tone one. This phone does not offer many widgets or useful ones I should say, especially for its three page homepage layout. Its locking locking feature has a picture that constantly changes and wont allow you to customize it. If you're looking for a phone to personalize, I'm sorry but you're looking at the wrong one. I like the phone to a certain degree, but its not for me personally. It's just a basic touchscreen. The battery life is absolutely horrible. Anything you do will suck it dry. You'll be lucky if it lasts you a day. Once it gets to two bars of battery life you have a half hour left at least, because it will soon enter low battery mode. In the end it was nice to upgrade from a RAZR...but this phone makes me want a new one. It's just not me, it might suit someone out there, but for customization and a true smart phone I'll have to find something else. Another thing, you have to CONSTANTLY get upgrades for the phone. I dont think the phone is personally worth it, unless you're giving it to your teenage kid. Hope my review helps, I'm sure I'm missing something but this was spur of the moment..

$$;
Pros:. Sleek Design. Camera with Flash. 
Cons:. Unconfigurable screensaver. Scroll. Battery life. Main Menu unconfigurable. Widget Bar = Pointless. Plenty more, see below. 
Summary:. I am very unhappy with this phone. I am in the information technology field and have no problem learning new electronics and was expecting to be blown away by this release but was sadly disappointed. To go into more detail on my cons... As everyone else has already mentioned, you cannot change the screensaver once the phone is locked... it flips through ALL of the backgrounds that are available on the phone, including butterflies and some other girly ones... I agree with another user that if you were wanting this phone for business use, it's not professional at all. The battery life was HORRIBLE and not to mention you have about a total of 5 mins after it says Low Battery before it completely shuts off... I did really ike a couple of the ringtones/alert tones, however there were very little to choose from to begin with. While texting, there's a neat feature where if you space twice it automatically creates a period as you would at the end of a sentence.. however, the phone isn't smart enough to recognize when you've already used a punctuation mark such as a question mark or exclamation and still adds a period. Not only that but if you delete the period and double space again, it does it again (Blackberry has the function as well but if you delete it once it's smart enough to realize you probably didn't want it there and allows you to double space again without adding a period again) The camera was pretty decent and the editing features on the phone are pretty cool. The scroll feature on the touch screen was absolutely horrible... it didn't matter how hard or softly you touched the screen or with how much or little of your finger, it would always select the wrong thing or open the wrong thing... I've worked with iPhones before and the scroll on them was much much much more accurate... The main menu (there are 3) sucks because they stick 2 pages full of apps that you can only use if you pay $5 here and $10 here and $3 there for each (menus 1 and 2) and you can't edit the order of them, so no matter what, when you need to get to something you actually NEED or that is USEFUL (ie, Settings, Tools, etc) you have to scroll through (good luck) to the 3rd flipping menu before you can get to them... The Widget bar is pretty much pointless, you add things to it, so when you need to get to them, you click the widget bar (to open it up) then click the icon you want, then the icon is placed on your main screen, then you have to click the icon that's been moved to your main screen before you can actually use the widget... I mean come on, that's 3 clicks for something I should only have to click once for... As you can see, simply not the phone for me... For those of you that like it, enjoy, for those of you that haven't bought it yet, don't.... 

$$;
Pros:. Slim. Lightweight. Good Reception. Good Battery Life. 
Cons:. Too many to list:. Texting is horrible on this phone.. Volume only goes up to 7.. To have your own ringtone you have to compress a song down to almost nothing.. Browser freezes occasionally.. Very hard to customize this phone. If.. 
Summary:. I can look past the majority of the cons that I listed above. But the one thing I cannot forgive the makers of this phone for is the god-awful texting functions. Without a doubt the worst full QWERTY keypad I've ever used. Unless you have super thin, pointy fingers texting on this phone will be a nightmare. So for most men, if you text a lot, this phone is a no-go. The keys are too small, the space bar is too small and positioned left of center so if you're right handed and you normally use your thumb to hit the space bar then you will constantly be hitting the ? key or the B key. I spend more time backspacing on this phone than any other I've used. And the T9 function on this phone is awful. Simple words that we use on a daily basis are not in this phone's memory. And unlike other phones, even if you constantly use a word that's not in its memory the phone will not remember that word for future use. I can't wait to unload this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. like the apps and how its organized. It looks amazing, very nice design. perfect size.. 
Cons:. the interface is sluggish, the solstice blows it away in speed. Its like samsung went backwards. I had it for a week and returned it for the solstice. If you want it to replace the iphone because u dont want the data plan this isnt the best choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks good, clear screen. 
Cons:. Bugs bugs bugs, and green screen of death.. 
Summary:. It doesn't let you know if the phone is charging when you plug it in. I have already had to swap it out for another mythic because the first one was such crap. It wouldn't shut down, it would simply restart. OR I would get the green screen of death and it would freeze, forcing me to take the battery out. Then while I would talk to someone a weird gray box would show up on it's own, saying "Please press the lock key to use in call functions." It would prohibit me from hearing the person on the other end, or from them hearing me, unless I put my phone on speaker. I hate all the icons, and how annoying it is to move them around, and it's dumb that you can't delete them if you don't want them there. The texting set up is way annoying, it takes AGES to write a text message. You have to push really hard to get the phone to recognize that you are typing, it's not sensitive like an ipod touch or iphone. There is no zoom on the camera either, it's so frustrating. Oh I hate this phone, and now I'm stuck with one for two years unless I want to pay full price for something else. What a pile of crap.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive; has a touchscreen; utilizes qwerty keyboard in landscape mode; camera and flash; decent overall appearance. 
Cons:. It is completely loaded with crappy software programs that you will never use but cannot delete. The operating system is extremely laggy and is not a pleasure to use. The battery life is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!. 
Summary:. Why would you but this phone when you can just get the Samsung Eternity? The battery life is 3x longer and it is half the price. The operating system is much smoother and everything else is pretty much the same. Unfortunately for the Mythic, the Eternity is older and is excused from not having the best features and the most user-friendly operating system. The Mythic, however, has no excuse for the annoyingly laggy responsiveness and for the amount of third-party software that comes pre-loaded on the phone.. This phone has no battery life to speak of and it is out-performed by an older, and cheaper, competitor. I have to say "shame on you" to CNET for giving this garbage a good review.. 

$$;
Pros:. A nice phone with a lot of features. If the battery life were better, it would be a good phone.. 
Cons:. I have tried 2 different batteries and both of them went dead after only 7 hours. During the 7 hours, I made only 1 phone call. I am sending the phone back and will try another A897. I hope they aren't all like this.. Not too many apps available. 
Summary:. You might as well go with the I phone because you have to get an unlimited data plan anyway. Plus there are a ton of apps for the I phone. I would also look into the Verizon Droid.. 

$$;
Pros:. large, readable screen. lightweight. nice music player. good camera w/flash. 
Cons:. unpredictable touchscreen. average to poor call reception. poor battery life. camera has no zoom. AT&#38;t's browser is lousy. very few apps, but AT&#38;T is more than willing to sell you apps or high-priced subscriptions. 
Summary:. I've had this phone for three months now. Very unhappy with it. Call reception is poor. A lot of places I can't even get reception when my wife's Iphone will. The touch screen is picky. Most of the apps that came with the phone require a subscription, while the free ones either don't work or are just free trials.. The battery is terrible. When I first got it, it would hold a charge for about 48 hours. Now, it won't hold a charge for 24 hours.. The only thing I really like about this phone is it's bright, readable screen. But that's not enough to keep this phone for. I'm trading it in.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice looking phone, clear screen.. 
Cons:. Samsung and Att customer service not very helpful. Phone has bugs and starts apps mysteriously, draining the battery.. 
Summary:. The phone was very confusing and not very user friendly. After a week i thought I had it figured it out only to still not be able to type on the key board, (still a month later I can't figure it out completly). Four days ago the icon for the moblie tv keeps showing on the screen. I've never subscribed to mobile tv app. App keeps draining the battery and have to have another charge every 8 hours.. Att couldn't figure it out and gave me the number to Samsung customer service. I called Samsung customer service and talked to "Mark" and he said I could mail it to get it diagnosed. Wait time for the service is 5-10 buisness days. Samsung has no phone loaner program and directed me to call Att and ask them.. How many of you could go 5-10 buisness days w/o a phone only one month after purchesing a "highly recommended" phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim, lightweight, qwerty touchscreen texting on landscape mode. Menu pages customizable. 3-megapixel camera with panoramic, video, FloTV. 
Cons:. Unresponsive touch screen (even when calibrated). Too easy to dial wrong contact without confirmation. Lagging response between features. Widgets not completely customizable. Touch screen shortcuts feature won't work with cycling, lock-screen wallpapers. 
Summary:. Wanted to like this phone with its great features, but am so frustrated, I just want to throw it. TV was the selling point, but now that I've had the phone 3 weeks and working with it, the touch screen is so unresponsive (even after being calibrated) that I can't accept calls in time before the caller hangs up. Scrolling through the contact list, it doesn't stop on the name I want, but it dials a name I don't want. Why can't it confirm if that's the contact I want before it dials it. And those widget icons keep popping out and loading up on the screen when I don't want them. My plan does not include apps, and Mythic doesn't allow me to exclude them from the widget list. The lockscreen, cycling wallpapers are a nuisance, when you set shortcuts on the touchscreen; so if you try to use the touch shortcuts, then the wallpaper starts scrolling to the next one and the next one. Samsung, you tried to put too many features on this phone and several don't work the way you would expect for the price of $150 with a 2-year contract. I'll be exchanging the Mythic for another model.. 

$$;
Pros:. Does not require data plan.. 
Cons:. Samsung's proprietary software is counterintuitive. Weak plastic construction.. 
Summary:. If your eligible for an upgrade through AT&#38;T and want a touchscreen phone the Iphone and some HTC's offer a superior experience to the Mythic.. OR. If you want a phone similar to a smart phone without the PDA plan chose a phone not using Samsung's abysmal proprietary software and better build quality such as the Motorola Karma.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great looking display - crisp and clean.. Holds lots of contacts. Takes up to 32 GB microSD. Standard headphone jack. Charge via USB. Great for normal personal or business text emails.. 
Cons:. Widget bar difficult to scroll w/o selecting.. PC does not recognize phone 1/3 of time. PC Studio poor. 
Summary:. Can't seem to master the art of scrolling through the widgets w/o inadvertently selecting widgets.. PC Studio for the Mythic does not support download of contacts. Was advised by 1 support person to use PC Studio for Solstice but the next support person said I can't do that and that he was going to "report" the previous one for telling me that. I did get my contacts from Outlook to Mythic using PC Studio for Solstice. Media transfer using PC Studio has been terrible. I see today that there is a FAQ that describes using other tools, which I will try because I'll never get my paltry 800 titles on the phone with PC Studio. Phone doesn't connect to PC most of the time. It has never been recognized by PC as a device, only occasionally by PC Studio (I'll try another PC sometime). Made 5 calls to support to get it connected and they never helped. I accidently got it to connect and have occasionally been able to do so since. When copying music I get an error at least 50% of the time (PC Studio). Hopefully the alternative methods will work but they depend on the phone being recognized by the PC.. Support personnel are very nice but I think they are hamstrung by a poor phone and poor tools. I was advised to uninstall/install PC Studio several times. PC Studio puts 14 rows in Win XP Programs list and the provided uninstall removes 1 of them.. Internet access works but hardly anything is readable and you have to click with a fingernail because list are crammed together. very difficult to effectively use.. Email works - that was my primary purpose for the phone other than calls. I can connect to hotmail, gmail and I have set up another account that is supported through my consulting business web site provider. This seems to work well. Don't bother with the emails with graphics, though. Great for "normal" personal or business text emails.. Bite the bullet and get an iPhone! I tried one and even with it's difficiencies it blows away this phone, even with the moderate extra cost (it looks like I'll be paying $20/month for data and email with this phone and it was $30 for iPhone).. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features... nice camera flash. 
Cons:. horrible touch screen. 

$$;
Pros:. I can report nothing good about this phone. 
Cons:. AT&#38;T will not replace the phone again. I really cannot depend on this phone for any function ie calling or texting. 25% of the time the phone will lock up requiring the battery to be removed to even restart.. 
Summary:. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE BUY A DIFFERENT PHONE OR USE ANOTHER SERVICE. I AM GOING TO GO TO ANOTHER PROVIDER WHEN THIS CONTRACT IS UP. AT&#38;T DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. It can call and text.. 
Cons:. The browser is slow, speakers are very low, only comes in one color(burgundy), often lags while using touch screen, can barely feel vibrations when on silent, and you can NOT change the lock screen wallpaper and the pictures on the phone are all dumb. 
Summary:. this phone is good for women in their 40s who want a touch screen phone but are too cheap to buy an iphone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great when the touch screen actully works!. 
Cons:. I've already had to send this phone back once &#38; it looks like I'm going to have to send it back again.1/2the touch screen won't work so it's registering as though I'm touching the other side of the screen&#38; it randomly turns off &#38;starts itself. 
Summary:. I loathe this phone and can't wait to get one that works!. 

$$;
Pros:. Many desirable features and sleek looking.. 
Cons:. This phone is sluggish. Type anything and you better have lots of patience to wait for it to respond. Don't buy this!!!. 
Summary:. Very disappointed in this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good phone as far as usage goes but.... 
Cons:. No master reset option in case of lost password or keypad malfunction.. 
Summary:. If you lose your password or forget it you are screwed. Your phone is rendered inoperable (unlike all other Samsungs and every other brand on the market). If some smart ass borrows your phone they can easily sabotage it in a few keystrokes so that next time you power it off your phone basically becomes a brick. Buy a different Samsung but not this one!. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone is very sleek and built nicely. The screen displays images beautifully, and the on-screen keyboard is very responsive.. 
Cons:. I can't possibly imagine why an international corporation would decide to not give the user the ability to change the lock screen background. I do not want to look at a butterfly every time I take my phone out. Lacks threaded texting.. 
Summary:. Don't purchase this phone, ever. It blows my mind that this phone managed to get approved for consumption by the general public. I honestly wonder if anyone actually works at Samsung, as this phone appears to have been designed by monkeys. Furthermore, I can't believe it has a score as high as it does on CNET. Pure trash. Anyone who had a part in the design of this phone: pat yourself on the back, you are truly inept.. 

$$;
Pros:. 3.3 inch touch screen with a good display. Samsung decided to finally include flash, 3.5 mm headset jack, and micro USB port. Samsung touch Wiz 2.0 has few improvements.. 
Cons:. Touch screen is very unresponsive in menus. It is sluggish, and lags more than any other phones out there. While screen has a good quality, it does not offer AMOLED like impression. The 200 dollars price is difficult to justify.. 
Summary:. If I could, I would have given 0 stars. I don't understand why Nicole did not address seriously about how slow the menu was. In fact, the touch screen response was so slow while I was changing menu pages. This is a serious problem for phone like this because this is a touch screen phone. The menu transition from one to another also showed a lag. When I say lag, I really mean it. The price of this phone is 199.99 dollars with 2 year contract after 50 dollars mail and rebate. I am not willing to overlook all of these issues with a high price tag like this. When you can get Blackberry curve or iphone for around 100 dollars, this is just absurd. If you worry about data package, then fine. Go for samsung impression with texting, or go for samsung solstice for porting. This phone is most unresponsive phone I have ever played with....
