we were able to walk to the peninsular in 20-30 minutes depending on time of day , pedestrian traffic and lights , so if you do want to get out and about , it 's not too far , plus there are several smaller markets nearby and the lovely kowloon park where you can feel completely away from it all among the trees , bird ponds ( with flamingos ) and a massive swimming pool complex - open air ( although it was closed for refurbishment ) and indoor .
on both occasions we found the hotel perfect for a short stay , although the weather was too cool to enjoy the rooftop pool ( it would be a godsend when the heat and humidity kicks in ) .
so this could save you a lot on the train or shuttle and even for 2 people , the time-saving and convenience is worth it ( 30mins door to door ) .
50pp each way ) to central district where we caught the 15 bus ( about $ 9pp ) to the top of victoria peak -a cliff-hanging ride ( 45-60 minutes each way ) with stunning views at the top .
taxis to/from the airport worked brilliantly - the cost is about $ 250 each way and on the way from the airport there had been 4 of us with enormous suitcases and they were all piled into the boot and tied down , no trouble .
we ate all our meals out except the excellent buffet breakfast ( stocked impressively to every taste ) which is discounted if booked through reception to an amazing $ 100pp .
by way of a trip down memory lane , we strolled to the peninsular and caught the star ferry ( still only $ 2 .
further down nathan rd ( towards peninsular ) , it tends to get more expensive and more upmarket retail .
i also felt that for a good quality city centre hotel , the room price was pretty reasonable , although i thought Â£70 to extend check-out until 6pm was expensive - we did n't pay a lot more for the nights .
location is good - in a busy area for loads of economical local style shops and restaurants ( go on , be brave , you 'll be made so welcome !
