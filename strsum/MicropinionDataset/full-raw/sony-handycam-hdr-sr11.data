i had been searching for an hd camcorder for a while , and looked at a lot of different camcorders before i found the hdr    sr11 after reading several reviews i knew this is the camera i wanted , i ended up buying the hdr    sr12 , however the only difference here is the size of the hd when i bought the camera i is ready to shoot as many videos as possible , the first couple of days i used shooting everything from the outside world to ultra close ups of salad heads  .
i must say i is very impressed with the quality that the videos were shot in , and this is before i realized that i was not even shooting in the highest quality range i would recommend this camera to everyone who can afford the rather expensive price , whether you want to use the camera for shooting the first steps of your new baby , or you want to shoot the amazing nature you live in , the hdr    sr11 has something for everyone and i have seen a lot of people complain about the missing mini hdmi cable , honestly if you can afford the camera , then you can also afford the extra cash for the cable , besides the camera comes packed with all other cables .
i purchased the camera about 10 months ago and it is simply a good product  .
the recording settings can be changed to make the picture as nice as you need  .
the higher the quality , the more hard drive space you will use up  .
i would make sure that you have a ton of space on your computer to transfer all of these files  .
i actually had to buy a computer with 640gb of drive space and i am adding another 1 tb hard drive to hold all the hd videos and pictures  .
i use pinnacle studio 12 to edit and create movies and have had no problems to date  .
the touch screen is easy to use and can be seen in the sunniest of places  .
other than a bit of finger print cleaning , it is pretty straight forward .
perfect  .
this camera is really beefed up  .
lots of functions to grow into  .
out the box it is ready to capture your moments in pristine clarity  .
i caught a 5 day disney vacation and did not even put a dent in the 60gb  .
this is definately a safe purchase that you'll enjoy for years and years  .
as i own an fx1 for professional purpose , i is very happy when this small hd camcorder had been released on the market  .
the quality of the immage in normal light conditions is better than fx1 , but this ends when you'll shot in low light the sound is really impresive when you are listening using a home cinema 5  .
1 ch  .
system over all i believe that this camcorder is all you may need for a holiday or for a private event  .
be sure that you turned on some lights , before starting to shot indoor videos , or attach a cam light .
i like this product it's a good product , till now it does not has a problem with the hardware and functionility  .
the support also a lot in singapore .
the video is as good as expected  .
the colors were brilliant , even at low lighting the colors are accurate  .
motion is smooth , even fast action is depicted without blurring or pixelating  .
the autofocus inspires faith and the face detection is exceptionally functional  .
the audio is astoundingly realistic and the 5  .
1 surround is superb  .
videos taken outside will have you looking around your livingroom for the barking dogs and squealing kids    kudos to sony  .
the photos are a little harsh but easily remedied with adjustments to the saturation and sharpness  .
with the excellent lens , the photos are on par with a low    level ccd camera the software is a piece of cake and very workable  .
it is so anemic but that makes it very simple to use  .
it transfers and allows you to burn dvd at hd or sd but hd dvds can only be viewed at 480x640 so it's a waste of space  .
i is leery about the avchd format from reading some of the difficulties others had , but it's not that big of a deal  .
my computer i built for under $400 last year (3  .
1ghz amd x2 dual core with 2gb ram) handles them without breaking a sweat  .
it took a little over an hour to burn a 46min sd dvd from files recorded at the highest resolution  .
however , until i purchase a blu    ray burner , the most satisfaction comes from playing straight from the camera via mini    hdmi    awesome  .
the camera is so easy to use i is filming right out of the box  .
the few changes i wanted to make were self explanatory using the on    screen menu  .
once i set the settings i wanted , i hardly touch them now  .
for most family videos , this camera is almost too good to be true and it's fun even for those of us who can ; t leave well enough alone  ) it is between this camera and the canon hg20  .
i haven't used the canon , but i do not really care anymor  .
this sony make it a moot point , i'm thrilled with it .
i own the sony hdr    sr 11 from the end of august 08  .
so i is very surprised when i after 8 years in 2000 overpassed from 3 vhs    c camcorders to mini    dv , now i�m very satisfied with the great and clear , full really coloured image quality in full hd  .
i use sony too videolight , external microphone for interviews etc  .
and widelens  .
i can recommend to edit video from this great camcorder in pinnacle studio 12 ultimate , incl  .
last update patch  .
for preview of videos from hdr    sr 11 and editing i use 24 full hd lcd with hdmi input , pc with n    vidia ge force 8600 gts with 512 ram (incl  .
hdmi cabel    i bought only adapter for mini    hdmi) , intel quad core q 6600 , 4 gb ram and 2 tb hdd  .
in so one combinations with pc hw and sonys� accessories you can reach really great videos  .
after my working with 4 formerly camcorders from the year 1992 i must say to sony   thank you again  .
all wishes fullfiled .
buy this camera  .
without a doubt just buy it  .
you cannot be dissapointed when looking at the video quality  .
if you want to be able to shoot more then get the hrd    sr12  .
ether one is amazing  .
also check out the accessories that sony offers  .
i got the boom mic and shot a wedding and it worked out awesome  .
client is amazed with quality of the footage  .
i got this camera after much research    i know they no longer sell it but if you can get this (or it's 120gb big brother the sr12) go for it  .
for the money , imho there is no better consumer camera    it is so good , it borders on the prosumer line (based on features and final product) .
the camcorder takes great hd video wonderful sound  .
i love having the hard drive that way i do not need to carry all those dvds , tapes , or even memory cards  .
the software is very limited is resources  .
the software has problem converting hd video to standard video to create a dvd  .
all in all this is a great camcorder .
i have this camacorder since two days  .
it works perfectly well , especially on a mac , where the free ilife , containing imovie 08 , is perfectly up to the job for editing footage i think i will have to buy a small tripod and a microphone effective against wind noise updated  .
on nov 10 , 2008  .
for the sake of capturing home videos of the family , this is a great camcorder  .
since i had to replace my minidv cam , this is definitely more than i really need , but at least i have the option to go hd now  .
all the controls are easy enough to figure out  .
the touch screen is simple to use  .
the camcorder itself has a nice solid feel to it with sturdy access doors  .
best of all no more master tapes stacking up on my shelves  .
overall i'm very pleased with using this camcorder  .
as an amateur , the picture and color quality are acceptable to my tastes  .
the still photos are also acceptable  .
when it comes to motion vs stills , my thoughts are   a camcorder is technologically designed specifically for motion and a digital photo camera for stills , try not to expect them to outperform each other one little quirk i've noticed so far is that when you attach any conversion lense , the lense will trip a sensor that disables the built    in flash  .
this makes sense if you were adding on a wide    angle lense which would block the flash , but not when it's something so simple as a uv lense  .
of course that's only significant when i'm taking stills , but it would be nice if there is a manual flash control located on the body for quick changes updated  .
on sep 20 , 2008  .
i have been buying camcorders since 1990 and know quite a bit about videos and camcorders  .
first of all , you cannot get any better then sony  .
secondly , this is by far the best camcorder to date  .
i is blown away by the picture quality  .
i tried all the settings , from standard definition (on lowest quality) , to high definition (set on it's highest quality) and the picture is incredible on every setting  .
cool 5  .
1 surround sound even made it better  .
the camera fits ever so nicely in my hand , very light , touch screen is a pleasure to use  .
not having to switch video tapes makes video capturing pleasant  .
everything stored on a large hard drive and downloaded to a pc with only a usb cable is a dream  .
i love it  .
as far as using it for still shots , the 10  .
2 mega pixels makes for incredible images  .
the build in flash and options makes shooting a breeze even for $1000 , i found the price not too bad considering what kind of camera you are getting  .
it's well worth it by far , the best camera i have used  .
making the decision to purchase a high    definition camcorder today can be very difficult considering the great number of choice to we consumers today  .
i had narrowed my search to three manufacturers , canon , jvc and sony , mainly because i had prior camcorder experience with all three  .
preparing to part with $1 , 000 on a want and not a need is very difficult  .
even at the store i found it difficult making a final decision after extensive research i settled on the sony hdr    sr11 because of the features and , primarily , the 60gb hard drive , as well as having the option to use memory stick duo media cards  .
having those options makes the camcorder flexible  .
i can hook the camera into my computer through the usb slot , or i can remove the media card and pop it into the card reader on my computer , or the memory card reader on my tv , as it is a sony product that accepts the memory stick another area where the sony has allowed added flexibility is in the number of quality settings from which one can choose  .
the highest quality records in full 1920 x 1080i  .
this permits you to save up to 7 hours 10 minutes worth of video on the hard drive  .
plenty of time for me , but for those who need more , standard definition settings are available to allow up to 41 hours of recording time the high    definition movies are stunning  .
very rich in detail and bold in color  .
it truly is a case where watching the movies are almost better than being there  .
for fun , i connected the sr11 to the tv via the included composite cable , and connected a jvc gr    d22u minidv through the firewire port  .
i put the tv on split    screen , and there is absolutely no comparison in the quality  .
the sony blew this sd camera away  .
with the sony , i could see every bubble in our swimming pool , every drop of water on the kids faces  .
with the jvc , i could tell the water is blue and that the kids were wet not only are the videos great , the photos are just as rich  .
sony claims 10  .
2 megapixel resolution  .
considering that 10mp cameras can cost $400    $500 on their own , it is a feature that adds even more value to this camcorder  .
you can take take photos and records at the same time  .
other nice touches are the dolby digital 5  .
1 surround recording  .
there is not a windscreen on the microphone , so a slight breeze can become annoying , but beyond that , the sound is quite good the lcd screen is a 3  .
2 touchpanel with widescreen format  .
as it has 921k pixels , it's looking at a mini 720p hdtv  .
i like the touchscreen , but i have to wipe it down after each use  .
looking through the regular viewfinder is kind of dull , small , and not very clear  .
kind of a disappointment a docking station and remote control are included  .
you can attach the camera to the station to charge the battery , and it also contains the high definition component connection as well as a usb output  .
surprisingly , there is no firewire output considering sony has been a champion of the i  .
link interface on the camcorder there is a mini    hdmi output , though sony does not include the cable  .
s    video and composite outputs are available also , and sony does include that cable  .
for inputs , you can attach a separate microphone and there is a shoe available for adding lighting equipment there are a host of additional features and specifications i could include in my review , but you can read about those on sony's website  .
i will mention one final cool thing  .
the night vision setting is great in a pitch black area  .
yes , the images are green , but the infrared capabilities are really good  .
it's like watching an episode of ghosthunters now that i've written of all the good things , i have to write of the mediocre  .
this camera records in the avchd format  .
this makes it great for transferring video to your computer in no time , but there is not much available in the way of software  .
also , as with any high definition media , unless you have a blue    ray player , you can not view your finished video in high    def format on a dvd player  .
they will be in high    def from the camera to the tv , and you can transfer avchd to dvd , but it will not be high definition  .
i have to say though , it's still great i have not had the opportunity to see videos from what would be considered prosumer hd camera , costing $2 , 000    $5 , 000 , but based on what i see from this camcorder , they cannot be much better .
i really like the camera so far  .
it's lightweight and and takes awesome footage  .
the battery it came with has about a 1  .
5 hours on a full charge (npf    h50)  .
i also got the accfh70 kit and that battery has about 3 hours on it  .
when i got the camera from sony , they had a great deal on the npf    h100 that beast has over 6 hours (with the lcd screen  .
the only bad thing i can say about the camera so far is that i am so afraid dropping the camera and breaking it to bits i know the plastic is light but my canon sd700is is like a tank compared to the sr11  .
anyway , get at least the 2 year service plan from sony its only an extra $99  .
what i like about this camera is that it can easily be accessorized  .
i will be getting married in guam this november , and our honeymoon will be in bohol i will be getting the waterresistant encasement for this camera and adding another review when we get back  .
i am amazed at this handycam  .
taking still while shooting video ; still image capture in its own mode  .
video quality and image quality are exceptional  .
i wanted the sr    12 but had to settle for sr    11 since these cameras are selling like hotcakes and sr    12 is out of stock  .
sony has a winner on their hand  .
i wish the included battery could run longer  .
i am extremely satisfied with this handycam .
if i had a top of the line desktop computer , with top of the line video software , and wanted a top of the line camcorder , i think this would be my pick , or the sr12  .
it takes some reading , and some practice , but within a few hours you would be looking like a professional camera person .
i is interested in getting a semi    pro camcorder for producing a presentation and web video , and i had settled on the sony hvr    a1u , which is has a single cmos sensor and records in the hdv format on mini dv cassettes  .
i liked it because it had xlr mic inputs with phantom power to attach high quality condenser microphones  .
however , i had really grown weary of the workflow with minidv tapes  .
not knowing what is on them , winding and rewinding , the time it takes to capture , and the hvr    a1u is bottom loading so you have to take it off the tripod to load it so when i saw the hdr    sr11 with a hard drive , i is very attracted to it  .
i know that the avchd is not quite as good as hdv (more compression  lower image quality , requires more powerful hardware to edit , etc) , but this camera has a higher data rate than previous avchd camcorders (similar to the canon hf    10) and had pretty good reviews for image quality after using this for awhile , it will be very difficult to go back to a tape workflow  .
it is a joy to manage your shots on this camera compared to working with minidv  .
each clip has a thumbnail , and it's all sorted by date (try finding anything on a tape)  .
and transferring to computer is much faster than capture is with minidv i fixed the microphone problem by purchasing a beachtek dxa    6 box , which allows connection of xlr condenser mics which require phantom power  .
i hooked up my akg perception 220 condenser mic and the sound is now insanely great  .
(this camera does have a decent built    in mic , but you really cannot compare)  .
i already have sony vegas 7 pro , which handles avchd , but my current system , relatively powerful (3  .
4ghz hyperthreaded pentium , 3gb ram , 2 drive raid) , which is a couple of years old , cannot really play it smoothly  .
but i have been able to successfully do some editing i bought the np    fh100 battery , and the camera is telling me i've got 6 hours of recording time  .
i have not yet had time to test this out to see if it's true the image quality is indeed very good , certainly more than adequate for what i will be using it for all in all , i'm very happy with this purchase all in all , i'm very  .
i bought the sr12 model and really love it  .
i'm not one to post my opinion but i'm blown away at the quality and ease of use  .
the face detection is ok  .
in a large crowd with varying depths i  .
church choir , the face detection constantly adjusts the focus on people's faces  .
i is interested in only one person but that person would focus in and out , so i turned it off  .
i brought the camera on vacation and showed diifferent types of video on a 52 inch 1080p lcd  .
the videos i showed included kids playing on the beach , people surfing , sporting events , indoors and out  .
every guy there is sold and said they are going to buy one as soon as they get home  .
they could not believe that such a little camera could produce such an amazing image  .
i also like the software that comes with the unit  .
it's easy to use and a nice addition to the video editing software i use thanks sony  .
its a great camera  .
it saves time because there uploading is fast and easy  .
but be ready to buy an external hard drive and blank dvd's  .
it's good practice to burn what you have recorded , otherwise you will find 500gig of your hard drive space go fast  .
if you buy this , its a good idea to invest in the battery early  .
stills are good but i like my the quality in my old nikon coolpix 5700  .
i especially like the feature where you can take stills while taking shooting vids  .
face detection works very well  .
i also like the hybrid memory card    hard drive design  .
excellent camera  .
60gig is enough for me because i upload immediately after each event  .
it might matter though when you are traveling for an extended period  .
in that case invest on the sr12  .
the doors are well thought of  .
sliding the ai shoe door and lifting the eyepiece up while the ai door is open shows attention to the design  .
oh , one big drawback when shooting using the power chord , don't just pull it out  .
you need to pause the camera and shut it off first then unplug the power  .
it does not let you switch to battery power while shooting or in standby updated  .
on nov 13 , 2010  .
i own the sr12e  .
please note that the amount of clips you record depend not only your hard disk space but the camcorder capacity is limited by its file system capacity  .
the file system capacity is set to be somewhere at the 4000 i could not record more than 4000 clips even that i still have 1200 minutes free to record  .
#8230 ;  .
and yes , this error grabbed me in the middle of my holiday .
i actually have the sr12 , which is only different by having more disk space    otherwise it is the same camera  .
it replaced an old sony 8mm camera  .
what a world of difference  .
video is awesome , photos are great , even while taking video  .
the avhcd works perfectly with imovie on my imac  .
could not be happier  .
my only complaint is that the controls are way too complicated for many technical tasks , and there is too much depth to the menu system    hard to navigate  .
but otherwise , it's a great purchase .
i came from the frame of mind that i could not deal with mini dv tapes anymore and have been eyeing avchd camcorders for about 9mos now  .
i is going to sony sr7 but i thought i should wait  .
and , a glad thing that i did       this camcorder is stunning  .
it's easy to use       my wife is up and shooting without any directions  .
transfer of files (atleast for mac users) is a snap (you need an intel mac though  .
it's like watching home movie footage in hi    def  .
it's mind    blowing , full 1920x1080 (1080i) videos  .
just need to hire a director to help me with car chases and explosions buy it from a place with a liberal return policy in case it's not to your liking also , one thing to note , what's up with the video reviewer  .
this is such an exciting product and sir sleepy is reviewing it , and even incorrectly  .
he is talking about face detection and hit another key (i think focus) good luck .
this is a great camcorder  .
if i were to go back and choose another i would get the sr12 due to its larger hard drive  .
this thing is fun and easy to use and captures excelent video quality  .
also if you wanted you can upgrade the lense for $100  .
they make a wide angle and a telephoto lense  .
i like the fact that this records directly to a hard drive it makes it much easier to edit  .
but you need a powerful computer to edit this format  .
my desktop is about 2 years old and kind of struggles in editing this format , i use my alienware laptop for editing and it does great  .
the software that comes with camcordr is easy to use but not much you can do with it therefore i use pinnacle ultimate and its great  .
i guess that the jist of it , great product .
spectacular camera  .
replacing 10 yr  .
old sony minidv camera that finally took a dive  .
placed this on backorder after researching hd camcorders for months  .
recently took a trip to branson missouri and is amazed with picture quality  .
went to a tobymac concert took pictures  .
great quality at 10  .
2 mp , easy to use even my wife can navigate which is important to the purchase  .
the ease of operation is amazing between movie and picture with a simple thumb move on the control  .
patience has paid off  if you have more patience than me , you might wait for a slight price drop , which i am sure will happen in the months to come the pros   hard drive has a lot of space even with hd  .
60gb is a lot  .
120 on the sr12 is nice , but i have already taped hours on the 60gb with plenty of space  .
if you are one to procrastinate on transferring data , 120 might be the way to go  .
i went ahead and bought the 4gb pro duo card in lieu of the hdmi cable  .
money spent either way and its easy to transfer the pictures or video to the duo and put into the ps3  .
conversion is simple and unbelievable  .
you can convert to standard dvd which is nice to play in the car for the kids to watch on long trips since its not avchd compatible  .
however , you can create both standard dvd    video or the hd avchd which plays on ps3s or blu    ray players and transfer to a dvd  .
the camera fits perfect in my hands , almost the size of a larger digital camera  .
the touch screen took a little getting use too , but once you start navigating it becomes easier  .
the engineers got it right for the consumer on this one  .
hot shoe available for an external flash  .
the quick on feature so you dont continuously turn on and off , but save battery power  .
1 dolby digital  .
face detection  .
slightly time consuming on conversion to dvd , but well worth the wait  .
you can format picture size between 4  3 to 16  9  .
the features are endless and spot on for people to learn quickly at ease the cons   the proprietary software (sony needs to expand a little in this category with options on menus , etc  .
the price , obviously ahead of the game on technology you will pay premium  .
hdmi cable not provided , but the card is nice  .
i is told by sony tech support when researching cameras this is a 1080p and it is not  .
windy situations picks up sound when taping , needs a wind filter  .
be cautious at loud concerts , the microphone is sensitive and i is at a loud christian concert where it sounds baffled  .
could be i is 5 rows from the front stage though  .
battery life is short on the battery provided , however , im a believer to have an extra one handy and the np    fh70 is a good purchase that lasted much longer than i expected  145 minutes or so  .
overall , the sr11 is an excellent choice for hd fanatics  .
im addicted and only owned it for a short period of time  .
friends are in awe of the picture quality and envious  .
although , my goal is to replace an old camera that failed on me  .
this purchase by far is worth the money  .
the conversion to dvd is so easy , but be patient  .
the quality from hd to dolby digital and still pictures is phenomenal  .
i keep telling myself to not purchase sony for several reasons and experience over the years (i  .
, tech support , repair    terrible) , but i end back with the purchase because of the cutting technology in the product .
i have had a mini dv for a number of years and this is light years better  .
i cannot believe the ease of use and the easy conversion to a standard def  .
dvd  .
i will be getting a blue ray player because this camcorder is unbelievable for the amateur family videographer  .
i is very nervous about the price , but now that i have used it i am so happy with the performance  .
no more tapes and mini dvd's sitting around  .
love the camera .
a friend and i used it in front of a green screen in both hd and sd  .
while the quality in sd turned out a little fuzzy , the hd video turned out great the microphone is not the problem with the camera , it's the audio processor  .
using an internal , external , or sony's hot shoe , the sound is always squashed to one level  .
there is no switch to turn the compressor off or to adjust the input beyond hi or low  .
picking up sounds of a person or two talking is fine , but to record your kids recital or musical is pointless without a standalone audio recorder .
i like my camera  .
it is definitively better than what i expected in terms of video quality  .
in daily operations , there are quite a number of things that you'd like to get changed    still it doesn't make it a bad camera  .
i would like to see some setting to use the ext  .
mic jack just for center sound , rather than switching off the internal mike  .
this would allow to use a radio microphone for a good sound of the person talking and still retain the ambient sound  .
it owuld be nice to have a car adapter , i  .
to charge your camera in the car  .
i purchased an inverter and use the ac power supply to charge  .
it would be great to have a second power supply that you could leave with the docking station  .
it would be great if there is some conversion software to allow editing your video in any software and convert it back to import back into the camera  .
i purchased vegas movie studio , which allows editing and converting , but it does not convert back  .
that is available in a more expensive edition of the software  .
i still like my camera  .
it offers many things and seduces to do mor ewith it , which is when you run into limitations i highly recommend purchasing an additional battery (possibly with higher capacity) , a wide angle lens might com in handy  .
the optical zoom is alway sufficient for my purpose , even at a 2x digital zoom , picture quality is still nice , however , sometimes things come too close  .
a neck strap definitively helps me not being too worried about the camera dropping for not holding it firm enough  .
you need a mini hdmi cable so you can enjoy in case you have no component jacks on your tv (as on my secondary) overall , a great camera , i recommend to all my friends who want hd movies  .
count in the extra money for the accessories i mentioned and you'll be very happy  .
a great camcorder , easy menu , a must if you are looking for a hd consumer camcorder able to record for hours at a time , and a ton of accessories are available for this camcorder as well  .
mini hd    standard hd plug is 9  .
99 on ebay .
i just bought this camera and have been educating myself on how to use it for an upcoming trip  .
i have one con before i even start  .
why is it my 10 year old jvc camcorder has more numerous fader effects than can be listed here , while my new thousand dollar sota hd camcorder only offers a solid black or white fade  .
c'mon sony  .
how is my artistic expression/creativity gonna show  .
it's enough to make me return it .
ok , now i spent $1 , 200 for this camera , i had to convince my wife that we need to move up another notch  .
ok , back from tahiti , bora bora and cross country , drive is full , did my backup onto my hard drive , now what , nothing to transfer this high end hd video to , no recorders out there to record all my video , no blue ray recorders that are affordable and best buy or circuit city has no clue how to transfer the hd , sony does not reply emails on this subject well it will sit in my drive till one day i will be able to watch my hd movies .
the hi    def mode videos are superb and the camera is light enough to carry around anywhere  .
i especially wanted the hard    drive because i is sick of having to shell out $5+ for each mini    dv tape and then having to remember to put a sticker on it to remind ourselves of what is on it .
overall its excelent , the camera looks sleak , it feels sleak and your movies look sleak  .
really easy to use for begineers , but has enough depth for those who like to fiddle settings for perfection the still camera i is very dissapointed in and it comes nowhere near my cannon ixus75 ( which is about �150) the touch screen needs a firm push for it to respond , and the menu system can at times be a little frustrating to navigate  .
the only touch screens i have ever really come to like is the iphone or the tomtom the sr11 is marginaly better then sony's satnav screens .
i did a lot of research before buying this camcorder and i believe if you want an hdd avchd this is the way to go , no better video quality in this format right now  .
be aware though , if you move this camera to fast from side to side you will get blurring indoors and out regarless of lighting conditions  .
mini dv , while on the way out , still exhibits best video characterists but avchd is catching up .
after having many different canon camcorders , i finally bought my first sony because of it's clearly superior hd imagery and excellent still images  .
the lens on this camera is outstanding  .
the sound pick up is also excellent without an external microphone  .
while a wind filter is desirable if it detracts from the current quality sound , i can live without it i usually use the viewfinder and not the lcd screen for shooting my videos and the lack of an exension to the viewfinder when using it with even the small battery is an inconvenience and more difficult with a large capacity battery sony should definitely provide a shoulder/neck strap with this and every camcorder  .
i often carry my camcorder with a dslr or point and shoot still camera  .
in fact , i'm using a canon neck srap with this camera as i could not find a suitable one for sale i'm very concerned about the low level altitude restriction of only 3000 meters (9800 feet) since i routinely shoot video and photos in colorado above that level  .
they also have a narrow 50    86 degree farenheit temperature recommendation  .
if , in fact , operation outside of these ranges is not possible i will rank this camera much lower  .
we spent january in south america and antarctica and my canon cameras worked fine at temperatures down to 10 degrees f  .
the canon stated operating conditions are 32    104 f and no limitation noted on altitude  .
canon also provides a full printed manual and not just a softward  .
pdf download i dislike the sony touch screen and much prefer using a joy stick and not having to open the lcd display for practically all actions ; however , i'm getting used to this limitation  .
the one touch knob control on front of camera is useful for fine tuning the focus (or any other single function you may desire)  .
my wife likes the easy record function provided and we took great video and photos on our first weekend with the camera at a zoo and on the beach  .
i loaded the sony software but do not use any of it as i find my existing photo organizers and ulead video studio 11  .
5 software to be superior do not but an hdmi cable for this camera at best buy unless you want to waste your mony  .
you can get one for $10 on line that works fine as opposed to the best buy over $100 offering .
great camera for an amateur/family as long as you're not accustomed to pro level equipment  .
even a consumer camera with minidv has a time code .
an excellent cam , easy to learn  .
great picture quality howver playing avchd files on a pc is very difficult , the software support for the native format has a long way to go .
at current $1650 price for the camera and $500 for decent software , it is not worth it its price  .
i paid less       $1200 for the camera    and feel like that turned out to be a poor value  .
the camera is pretty good , works , takes nice stills , nice video provided you just want to plug directly into a hdtv and never edit with a temp software trial , i is able to edit 1 important item  .
learning curve on the software is pretty high for any sophisticated editiing  .
video processing is very slooooow even on the fastest quad processor pc's  .
software support sucks and is way overpriced , as is the camera  .
do yourself a favor and buy a $400 camera that is not hd and can dump files direct for web publishing  .
you'll use it far more  .
overall value is poor when i bought it and is now worse for new buyers as the price of the camera has risen substantially  .
do not waste your money on this overpriced gadget unless you want to pay over $2k to do basic video editing of your media , and have tons of time to perform that editing  .
overall very poor value at the current price and terrible software support with the product as it ships .
can anyone help i have a sony dvd camcorder at the moment and am thinking of getting the sr11 , the disadvantages to the dvd one is when i edit using hd pinnacle i seem to loose quality , if i play the dvd straight from the camcorder the quality is excellent but after edditing it seems to be not as good i am wondering if the sr11 recordings are good even after edditing , if anyone can help me it would be much appreciated  .
i would say , not a worthy buy for the $'s you spend on this image clarity is not good while panning  .
we need to be real slow while panning  .
image stabilization is not good while your subject is changes from near to far and vice    versa  .
we have this issue even when you try to take video while walking so you can forget about taking the video while you are driving in a car and etc  .
i have checked the same with few of my friends , who has this handycam its to make sure that my piece is not faulty one sr45 , sr85 , sr300 and etc does not have this prob i guess you need to compromise on this issue if you are interested to have hd quality image .
when i bought this just over a year ago it is $1 , 200  .
i thought i is buying the best for my new born son  .
while the video it did produce is decent , it is incredibly difficult to edit and is pretty much worthless if you want to upload it to youtube or edit and burn to a dvd , so do not bother with it if these are important to you (and if you have children , this will be important)  .
the screen went dead just after this went out of warranty as well  .
this is very typical sony , their craftsmanship is notoriously bad , high price , poor quality product  .
i've had 5 laptops from them and three televisions , they've all had issues  .
i've been switching to other products little by little and i'm very very happy to say that i'm completely free of sony's diseased products , i've switched all the office laptops to mac , our televisions to samsungs and sharps (both outstanding products) and finally this camera has gone into the garbage after a year (the quoted price to fix it from sony is just under $1 , 000 they must have thought i is mentally retarded to accept that price)  .
i bought a new canon hd video camera , which is what i is going to buy in the first place , and i went against my better judgement  .
it's outstanding , i've been using it for two months now almost everyday and it's head and shoulders above every sony product i've ever used  .
stay away from sony , you may say that my opinion is tainted , and that may be true given my history with their products , but to have the touch screen completely fail after 1 year , just after the warranty is over and then have them quote me $1 , 000 to fix it well you judge for yourself whether you'd want to get into a situation like that or just buy a brand that works .
warranty covers labor for first 90 days only  .
parts for one year  .
did not expect to have to pay $149 on a $1100 camcorder only 5 months later .
the onboard software is crappy , to many errors the hdd is crappy , stores data only to crater when you try and copy sony must recall and replace all hdd's or refund everyone's money i held this product with extreme caution and userability only to have the hdd crapout when trying to access for burning dvd on another sony product the sony dvd recorder dvd/vhs which is supposed to be the greatest media compatibility for the high priced sr11 boy is i ever miss    informed good luck if you buy this product or have it written in the purchase contract for warranty on the hdd to be extended beyond 1 year my hdd crapped out after less than 8 months use and only 42 files of precious family data all lost and no way to recover yet .
two months ago , i sprang for this much pricier camcorder than i normally would have because we were celebrating my husband's 50th birthday with our first vacation to europe in 25 years  .
with the larger hard drive on this camera , it meant i didn't have to drag my laptop along for transferring the video in the middle of the trip , i tried to replay the video i had just taken , and i got a screen that read , hdd format error  .
nothing had happened to the camera       i did not drop it , there were no extremes of temperature , nothing knocked it  .
mistakenly thinking that sony is a stand    up company and would take care of this , i put the camera away for the rest of the trip and called sony when i got home the news is not good  .
sony reports that its warranty covers repairing the camera to factory standards but will not even attempt to recover the video instead , sony's customer relations recommended i try a third party hard drive recovery service  .
if all of the video is recovered , i will pay out of pocket about $1200    1400 , on top of the $1200 i spent on the camera  .
sony does not reimburse anything the customer relations representative is incapable of comprehending the bitter irony that sony is willing to restore my camera to the very same factory settings that put my vacation memories at risk unless you plan to back up each and every video clip as you take them , do not buy this camera  .
do not assume that your experience will be any different .
the bottom line is this camera is not reliable  .
it is used in recording my trip to italy which is 10 days of some of the most amassing sights you could imagine  .
until i went to review some footage before i started the trek back home ooooops , hd format error  .
everything , gone  .
sorry , we can recover your media for 1200 dollars .
very disappointed in this camcorder the colours were faded and artificial when compared to other brands the details were lacking as well  .
there also seemed to be high levels of noise under low light recordings .
after reading alot of reviews i went to the retail store to see for myself  .
i compared side by side the sr11/12 with the canons and the jvc hd30/40 in the retail store under various lighting conditions and connected them to identical lcd panels  .
all camcorders were set to their out of box settings along with the identical lcd screens  .
the results were amazing  .
the jvc left the sony sr11/12 and the canons for dead  .
the jvc gz    hd30/40 had a better image , sharper details and the colours on the jvc looked better  .
also the jvc is not as noisy as the others especially under low lights i ended up purchaseing the jvc hd40 and i'm extremely happy with it  .
my friend has a sr12 and he even agrees with me when we compared the two models side by side ourselves  .
i definatley recommend that you all do this and see for yourself .
the camera uses odd formats    so the movies are difficult to manage (the sony software is very poor) plus the hd cannot behave as a regular hd in windows    so if you have any problems all you can you is a) return it for warantee repair (and lose all data) , b) sell it as faulty (see ebay    there are a few) , c) pay to have it mended out of warantee and risk it all again  .
fortunatey we backed up everything every day    but while filming one day it announced a buffer error    then e  31  00 and that is that    borneo , singapore , christening all gone forever (except for the backup)  .
the point is with a 120gb drive    you can lose a huge amount of footage in one go  .
we filled about half the drive in six months (all backed up)    but you dont know if the drive is faulty until you get to the bad sector or whatever it was  .
and then as soon as you get to the faulty bit    poof  .
if you phone sony they just look up e errors in the manual and say it has to be returned  .
the chap said hmm were you using it outdoors  .
actually i was not so he said it might be the central heating  .
there are no rescue disc possibilities , no    norton disc doctor nothing one minute its working and next minute its a �700 paper weight  .
even returning it is a hassle  .
you have to wait for them to post you a form to fill in to apply for a repair  .
the online repair request system does not work with these cameras for some reason i is just filming    nothing odd unusual or dangerous  .
just standing holding the camera  .
i cant imagine its anything more than a corrupt file    like you may get on a pc from time to time    but there is absiolutely nothing you can do as an end user  .
a google search finds many others with the same problem    but no solution its a lovely camera and the picture quality is superb but the quality of the drive is just not up to the job .
