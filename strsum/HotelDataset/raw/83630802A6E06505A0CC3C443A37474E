arriving on the 17hr00 air france as the sun goes down i was reassured by the knowledge i would take the shuttle from the airport as advertised , except where is it ?
walking around getting no help and telephoning the hotel six times only to sit for 20 minutes on hold music while different guys keep telling me they offer a cheap service to the hotel or they are the shuttle ( unmarked old cars ) ended up with me reentering the airport after the sun went down to try and change some money and get an official taxi .
being friday everything is closed in the airport now and the taxi drivers are circling me with people offering to change money .
feeling very unsecure i chose the best taxi i could and paid 40 euro for a five minute ride to the hotel .
if you are traveling alone or especially female this is not a good position to be in at all .
arriving at the hotel four receptionists doing nothing ( not answering the phone that was beeping on the desk in front of them ) told me the shuttle does not run in the evening or weekends .
be very aware of this and carry euros to pay for the taxi as no shuttle will collect you .
inside the hotel , front reception very grand but going to the rooms you will find them of very average quality .
if in europe expect to pay around 40-50 . . .

if in europe expect to pay around 40-50 euro in a major city , bathroom pretty basic and only of reasonable quality .
within walking distance are some fairly good restaurants .
they at least take amex but overall i can not recommend this hotel especially if you value your safety or security at all .
whilst i can not comment on the ibis next door i will be trying them next time so wait for a review before you make your decision if you can.
