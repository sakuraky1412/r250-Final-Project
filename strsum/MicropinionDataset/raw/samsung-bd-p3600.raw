Pros:. The samsung Bluray player has excelent HD resulution 1080p quality,and it went perfect for my Panasonic TC-P50S1 1080P 600HZ PLAZMA HDTV.It gave excelent color especialy with Dreamworks, and Pixar movies. This Blu ray plays DVDs to near HD.. 
Cons:. This bluray player is not the best I ever heard. It take 10 minutes to download a movie from Netflix. Even if the DVDs are 1080p upscaling, they realy are standard definition,480p resulution of a bluray player.. 
Summary:. The Samsung bluray player is one of the best bluray players I ever heard. It has an excelent FULLHD resulution,1080p, 600HZ . This bluray player can choose the resulution to 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i, 1080p,60HZ,120HZ,240HZ,and 600HZ. It can download to the internet, at Pandora, Blockbuster, Netflix, and You Tube. The bluray player can play standard DVDs to near HD. And that is why, the Samsung BD 3600 Bluray player is one of the best blu ray players I ever seen.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the WIFi and it plays great. I love the Netflix on it.. 
Cons:. At first it had problems freezing up and it would have to be restarted. It still does that once in a while now but not so much since i have the lastest filmware.. 
Summary:. This was my first Bluray player. I went with the Samsung brand because they were the first to come out with one so I thought they knew the most about how to mae one. I am not not diappointed at all. I would recommend this player and tech support has been great.. 

$$;
Pros:. This Blu-ray player has everything you need. Easy set up, picture very clear. Blockbuster, Netflix, Pandora and Youtube streaming capability worked like a charm. Another pleasant surprise was to hook up to my PC and view videos, pix etc stored on it.. 
Cons:. Someone who isn't familiar with connecting to a secured wireless network, getting the encryption key set up, connecting to a windows network may be overwhelming. The unit works and behaves exactly as expected. It would be nice to have DVR capability.. 
Summary:. Would definitely recommend it. Dont believe the negative postings. Just buy from a store not online. If you do run into a bad unit, you can change it. This unit works as expected and it has a lot of great features.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy Set up. Just follow the steps. Don't get ahead of yourself. The cost is the same as Sony's BDN- N460 model and this has the wifi dongle that Sony makes you buy @ about 75.00 extra.. 
Cons:. The remote does not have a code to control my TV.. 
Summary:. I researched which Blu-Ray play to buy for several weeks before I chose this player. I wanted a player that would be able to let me watch my current DVD's and the new Blu Ray movies and the ability to watch Net Flix on my flat screen. I have a Dynex 42 inch LCD TV. I am NOT a computer/video geek so I was worried about set up and the other problems that I have read about Samsung's Blu-Ray players. The reviews by the 'Experts' rated this player as one of the best to own. I also read the reviews by the folks that have bought the player. The biggest problem I read about was the problem of the 1st "upgrade/download". It seems that everyone that had a problem with this player had completed the downloading directly to the player and that caused the 'death' of the player. Everyone that downloading to a USB Drive then uploaded to the player had no problem. This is what I did and had no problems. The player took a few minutes to download ( I walked away and fixed a sode so give it 10 minutes. The player shut itself off (it is supposed to) As far as hooking up the Net Flix streaming to my TV (I had Net Flix already) it was easy. Just follow the steps in the book. Insert the dongle, and proceed with the steps. My wifi network was picked up by the player, You do need to know what WEP, WPAPSK OR WPA2PSK setting is and then need to enter your password ( I hope it is simpler and shorter then mine, it does need to be exact!) I was watching a movie before I knew what I had done. The only problem I have is getting the remote control to work on my TV. I am sure that one of the computer/video geeks (thank you all) out there will have that answer also. Once that was completed I entered the Net flix button and watched the first movie in the queue. My wife had about 20 movies already waiting to watch. I just finished watching the new Star Trex Movie and am really glad I waited and reviewed all the different players before settling on this one. I bought mine at Amazon.com because Best Buy did not want to price match.. I recommend this player to everyone!!!!!. Updated. on Jan 23, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. This unit delivers super sharp pictures, even on standard DVD's and the audio adjustments even improve the surround sound through an audio receiver. The included wireless LAN adapter makes wifi settings quick, simple and reliable.. 
Cons:. Nothing negative so far.. 
Summary:. The bottom-line is that this blu-ray player is a fabulous product for movies and streaming audio from Pandora. It is a great value, especially since the wireless LAN adapter is included. Set-up is quick and easy and the connections through an 802.11n wireless router seem to be 100% reliable. I have to think that those who have a bad experience are doing something wrong in their set-up. Highly recommended!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Not only does it look great, it is fast, and with the wifi capabilities, Pandora, netflix, etc this thing kicks but. very easy setup.. 
Cons:. the updates erase your network settings, however they are very easy to setup.. 
Summary:. I love it.. Updated. on Jan 12, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. WORKED RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. 
Cons:. NONE SO FAR. 
Summary:. FUNCTIONALITY AND FEATURES ARE AWSOME....ITS A REFURB CAME WITH 2.05 UPGARDE INSTALLED ...TOOK ME 1HR TO SETUP PC SHARE OTHER THEN THAT ITS A GREAT BLUE RAY PLAYER..... 

$$;
Pros:. Quick and easy access to YouTube, Netflix, Blockbuster and Pandora; Wireless capable; Great Blu-ray image and sound; Was relatively easy to set up; Fast loading compared to other Blu-ray players.. 
Cons:. None so far.. 
Summary:. I wanted to buy my first Blu-ray player now that prices had come down and the players had improved. After researching Consumer Reports, CNET, and other professional reviews, I zeroed in on the Samsung BD-P3600 as a new, feature-laden model that was uniformly highly rated. However, after reading all the negative reviews from CNET users (as compared to professional reviewers), I was very hesitant and almost purchased a different model that would have had less features. I'm glad I stuck to my original choice however.. Maybe Samsung has made improvements to the model or software updates, or perhaps I was just lucky, but I have had none of the other problems that some people said they experienced.. I am by no means an electronics or computer expert, but I had no difficulty setting up this player or connecting it to my existing WiFi. I followed the instructions step-by-step and then also updated the software once I connected to my DSL. The updating process took about 20 minutes and worked fine.. I can now easily watch YouTube videos or watch instant movies from my Netflix account. It has worked flawlessly just as advertised and as it did in all the professional reviews I read. Also, it loads very DVDs quickly compared to the rather slow speed most other Blu-ray players load.. Overall, this is a great Blu-ray player! I spent a lot of time researching my choice and to date, I have found nothing to make me regret my choice. For the price, you get more features than most other Blu-ray players on the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. picture and sound quality. connectivity options. ease of use. easy firmware upgrades. 
Cons:. i would rather have the buttons on the front instead of the top.. wish there was t9 entery for youtube/pandora/netflix use. (maybe there is but i haven't looked yet). 
Summary:. I hooked this up via hdmi and ethernet. upgraded the firmware (took about 20min). and then enjoyed a picture perfect screening of transformers 2.. The large number of negative reviews make me think that this might not be the most user friendly unit. I personally had zero problems. I beleive that 99% of the problems listed in other reviews are due to user error. Upgrading the firmware is important step that many people skip.. I can't imagine a company like samsung sending out a unit with a 50% failure rate. and the people that have tried 3 units with no luck??? really?. 

$$;
Pros:. Analog 7.1 outputs. Netflix. Fast load times.. 
Cons:. That the quick bookmark buttons so low on the remote. 
Summary:. Buy this unit!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great styling of the unit to be less noticeable and sleak. The picture quality and ease of use after setup is amazing.. 
Cons:. Fairly difficult to setup but even with my limited knowledge I was able to do it. I can't understand all the complaints because with a little patience I accomplished the setup. The other reviews scared me but I went for it.. 
Summary:. This has to be the nicest unit I have seen on the market. Sleak top mounted controls are great on my bedroom dresser.. Once it was up and running it has been fantastic and I am ordering a second unit. I already have two LCD Samsung 40" tv's and these units are integrated with those.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wireless Streaming Performance. Picture and Audio Quality. WiFi Setup. 
Cons:. User manual - Max resolution of PC streaming is not cleared stated. 
Summary:. I really don't understand why there are so many negative reviews on BD-P3600. I guess some are due to operator error, or maybe some purchased refurbished units. Anyway, this is my first Blu Ray player. I bought it from B&#38;H for $219, and I absolutely love it!. First off, I heard from many people that Blu Ray players are slow to load, so the first thing I did was to check out how fast it loaded, and to my surprise, it was not slow at all, maybe a few seconds longer than a traditional DVD player.. The feature I loved the most is the wireless streaming, not only the WiFi setup is a breeze (I use WPA2PSK), but the streaming speed is impressive. With 802.11A/G wireless connection, the player typically takes about 10-15 seconds to load a HD movie from NetFlix. PC streaming setup is straightforward as long as you understand how Windows file sharing works. I have a Windows 7 PC at home, and had no problem accessing the shared folder.. The picture quality of Blu Ray is top notch, so is the audio quality. My unit is plugged into my Onkyo TX-SR705 via a HDMI cable. The HD streaming from NetFlix is decent, close to 720p quality.. The only problem I ran into was the maximum resolution of PC streaming was nowhere to be found inthe user manual, and I had to Google it. Turned out the max resolution that could be played on this player is about 848x480.. All and all this is a great Blu Ray player. If you buy it online, make sure you buy it from a reputable vendor, and make sure you are not buying a refurbished unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wireless, easy to set-up, beautiful picture, does everything advertised, and it looks great as well.. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. I don't know what player these other people got, unless they work for Sony they must have gotten bad players, this thing is beautiful, easy to operate and has an incredible picture, access to Pandora, Netflix is just fantastic, 1 G on board memory, expandable, it's a dream machine.. Updated. on Nov 26, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. We love the streaming. 
Cons:. it makes a disturbingly load noise when we turn it on as it tries to load a disc when the tray is empty.. 
Summary:. We loooooooooooooooooooooooooove this. I was worried w/ all the early bad reviews but right after the firmware upgrade, all was perfection. I tried to connect it to my airport first, call tech support when it didn't work &#38; they just told me it wasn't compatible w/ apple. Well, it is. At least w/ ours. We get netflix, blockbuster, pondora &#38; utube &#38; can't wait to see what it will give us next w/ any future firmware upgrades..... 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of setup. firmware downloads. video and audio quality. 
Cons:. NONE!!!!!!. 
Summary:. I read dozens of reviews of this product before I bought. Load speed, not playing some DVDs, incompatable with some systems, were some of the cons I read. I have not seen any of these. One plug (HDMI) hook up and I'm in. Outstanding video and audio. I'm running it through my Sony 5.1 HDMI system and can't be happier. At first I could not play MUTANT CHRONICLES, but after the firmware update it played great and I had BLOCKBUSTER and YOU TUBE besides. My only glitch is I can't seem to hook up to my home network. It will recognize it and I am able to see it and I can download NETFLIX, BLOCKBUSTER and YOU TUBE, but I can't see files on my own network. My bust. I am just not savy enough to do it. I can't seem to get past the log in and password. If anybody can help I'd appreciate it. Meanwhile I am really enjoying this product. No Buyer Remorse.. 

$$;
Pros:. I needed a BD with analog 7.1 audio outputs so this was my choice. The streaming video with Netflix is a great bonus and I use it more than the BD player. Works flawlessly with WiFi dongle and connects without any problems!. 
Cons:. However, streaming didn't work well at all and I was very disappointed in that feature. SAMSUNG finally came out with a firmware fix that showed up ON SCREEN and I downloaded to much glee.. 
Summary:. Get this player and get the v2.03xx firmare upgrade !! You'll love it. If you are still operating on the V1.xx firmware, you will hate it! They also added links to Blockbuster and UTube !!! Great for sharing home vids with the family!. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of really cool bonas features like Netflix, BlockBuster, Pandora, YouTube and BD Live. 
Cons:. Nothing at all.. 
Summary:. This is the first BluRay Player to do Blockbuster I don't use block buster I use Netflix but it still has the option to use Blockbuster. I had the LG BD-390 It was terrable each time you tured it on you had to reconfeger the network settings. So I got this and it blows it away! Highly Recomended!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick startup. Netflix and Pandora work fine; but I have N WiFi which this device can use, G will be slower.. Video and sound great.. 
Cons:. Remote requires direct pointing compared to the Samsung TV remote which has a wide field. I wish the touch controls were on the front.. Firmware upgrade wipes out the WiFi settings, so once you get it right, write it down.. 
Summary:. As it happens I also have a Samsung LCD monitor which I've had for years with no problems and a Samsung cell phone and a Samsung TV. Their stuff is good. No, I don't own stock in the company.. 

$$;
Pros:. Having access to Pandora and streaming Netflicks is why I paid extra to purchase this unit. It was well worth the extra money. Wireless connectivity is the only way I can get media into some portions of my home, so this was the logical choice.. 
Cons:. After some initial wireless connectivity issues, I called Tech support and discovered that the wireless router/access point must be manually configured to open ports 443 &#38; 80. Once this was accomplished, the player works wonderfully.. 
Summary:. I love it and would highly recomment it. Samsung has improved their support department, making them very accessible and helpful. The quality of their products is far superior to anything else on the market...especially Sony. I had a Sony Bravia TV and Sony DVD player that both went back to the store because they were total CRAP, requiring multiple service calls that did nothing to solve their opertaing issues. Samsung hit a home run with this BD player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup, just needed to get the correct password for my wi-fi from my partner and away it went. Picture quality is unbeleivable, upconfersion is much better than my older sony unit.. 
Cons:. touch buttons on top of unit, while cool looking, are hard to use. 
Summary:. It took me less than 10 minutes to get this unit working, and an additional 1/2 hour to set up the dongle, part of that time calling my partner for the correct password. While not the unit's falult, netflix HD is not blu-ray quality, but almost, and only does 2 channel out, not surround.. Updated. on Oct 8, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Samsung is know for its fast loading time and perfect image quality. It probably the best Blu-ray player in the market. I recommend you to check out http://www.squidoo.com/best-blu-ray-player to find out the best and cheapest Blu-ray players.. 
Cons:. No bad point to this Blu-ray player.. 
Summary:. As an electronic sales, I recommend you get either PS3 or Samsung as your Blu-ray player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super fast wifi, pandora, netflix, excellent upscale for regular Dvd's, dynamite blu ray play, great options for connecting hardware, sound is outstanding, crisp and clean. The design also fits perfectly with the samsung line of products.. 
Cons:. Player feels a little delicate, top side button placement is odd, but a non issue with a remote, occasionally you have to reset your wifi connection when you close out, but nothing to lose sleep over.. 
Summary:. It is clear that for 2009 and into the forseeable future, everyone will want a Blu Ray Player with wifi because it just makes life so easy. The Samsung is the first out to market, and it is feature rich and plays sound and video like a champ. Watched Punisher War Zone on it this weekend, a fairly meaty film with a lot of fast paced action, and the player did not hiccup once, neither did the sound. The Dark Knight looked amazing and well. I used Walle as upscale, looked terrific. The only film so far that didn't look a lot better then I thought it would was Serenity, the Joss Whedon film that came out a few years back. I didn't see a lot of improvement in the picture from my regular DVD. Have no idea why, but its no big deal. The Price tag initially threw me but in the end, for a future proof player, it's worth the investment. I would also recommend using a Samsung television with it if possible, the sync is a great feature, and once you have the perfect universal remote, your good to go!!!. Great job Samsung!!. 

$$;
Pros:. I for sure like the speed / Loading and ejection ( Way to Go Samsung!). wifi is got to be the next best thing, Netflix is grand!. No issues with play back at all so far.. Up converting is about as good as the 2550 I could tell no difference,very good.. 
Cons:. The price is a little high but you do get a lot of bells for the buck.. 
Summary:. I have owned 3 other Players BD-1200, BD 1400 and the BD 2550... the BD 3600 is by far the best. I almost went with Sony this time but my friend has had some firmware issues with the Sony as well , so I went with Samsung again.. The wireless network set up went perfect the first try!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast loading speed is great!Netflix &#38; Pandora are awesome!. 
Cons:. none.(unless you plan on not using the remote &#38; getting fingerprints on top of the machine!). 
Summary:. I had no problem setting up. (If you have somewhat knowledge of electronics and can read the instructions there should be NO problem!)I ran an ethernet line to my player from a router instead of wi-fi.(I like that solid line connection)It has fantastic picture &#38; AWESOME sound through my surround system.Would defenitly recommend to anyone who is into High quality 1080p HD &#38; surround sound!. 

$$;
Pros:. -Pandora, Netflix, Youtube &#38; Blockbuster. Blu-ray picture is amazing!. 
Cons:. - Hard time keeping the 24hz option "active". Every time I turn off my blu-ray player that feature resets to 60hz and I have to go into the settings and turn on 24 again.... 
Summary:. Overall great player. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up, Awesome picture quality. 
Cons:. Dust magnet, Buttons on top are not always responsive.. 
Summary:. I wanted the LG BD390 over this player but when I found out the 390 was being discontinued I quickly changed my mind. I took a chance buying this player only because it had the same features as the 390. When I brought it home I quickly looked up some reviews before opening. To my dismay the reviews I read didn't give me much hope. I gave it a chance anyway and I 'm glad I did I had it up and running in no time. The player hooked up seamlessly to my network despite all the problems everyone else has been having. The picture quality is awesome and it loads quickly. I recommend this player but I also recommend buying an extended warranty just in case for their might be a lemon factor.. 

$$;
Pros:. User Interface and tones of new features, the netflix and the blockbuster streaming is very good, I used both the Ethernet cable and the wireless USB thing and it is really awesome moview clarity.. 
Cons:. I didnt like the buttons on the top of the player, they were a little confusing in the beginning, but I got used to it.. 
Summary:. I bought this on Christmas and I am throughly enjoying it. It has very good/easy to follow user interface, and you can easily get addicted to it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wired/wireless network connectivity. Netflix, Blockbuster, Pandora, Youtube, and PC streaming access, all-in-one. 7.1 Channel. Firmware upgradable. Full HDMI and Digital Audio outlets. Memory expansion via USB ports. Extensive menu setup options.. 
Cons:. None so far. The CNET review complained about the on unit controls being on top, but that's not a problem if you're not going to stack things on top of it.. 
Summary:. Excellent blu-ray player with a load of other features that make you forget that it is a blu-ray player. When I first took it out off the box and connected the power and my network access to the internet, it immediately went to the Samsung site and found a firmware update for it and asked me to install it. The onboard menu options were very simple and I didn't need the manual to tell me how to setup different things. I was going to setup and use wireless on this, but I recommend using awired network connection so you can get more bandwidth for the video, PC and Pandora Internet Radio streaming. I did try the wireless and static IP network settings and it worked flawless. Playing regular DVD's upscaled to a higher resolution with a noticeable difference in quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Excellent picture quality. - Excellent sound quality. - Good Pandora integration. - Good Netflix integration. - Remote is pretty good. - Wireless setup was simple.. - Very quick startup for a blu-ray player.. 
Cons:. - Brief (1-second) black screen on each dvd/netflix movie.. - Netflix &#38; Pandora integration could be better. Would like the ability to add to queue on Netflix, and more capabilities on Pandora.. 
Summary:. Bottom line is that this player works, and it works well. It took me about 15 minutes to get it set up and play a dvd. Maybe a few more minutes to configure wireless access.. I expected much longer start-up times on each disc (based on reviews elsewhere and for other players). My fears were unfounded. It loads each blu-ray disc I've played in 15 to 20 seconds.. I've been using this player for about two months now. That includes a number of SD discs, Blu-Ray discs, Netflix movies, and Pandora stations. I've seen it freeze a time or two, but it hasn't been a repetitive problem. I've seen problems with Netflix downloads, but only when either my home network or the Netflix service are bogged down.. The feature we use the most is the Netflix integration. Before this player, we usually watched one episode of a TV series on a Netflix DVD each night. If the series was really good, we'd run out of episodes and have to wait for the next DVD to arrive in the mail. With this player, that's no longer a problem. We can watch whatever we want, whenever we want. We have no cable subscription, just Netflix. I thought that would be temporary, but with the Samsung player and Netflix, it looks like we'll be able to make it permanent. So this player is saving us about $30 to $40 a month. It will pay for itself very soon.. I've recommended this player to a number of friends, and if it ever goes out on me, I'll probably buy another.. 

$$;
Pros:. Streaming video.. Sound quality. Clarity of picture. Auto Firmware updating. 
Cons:. Time system takes to upload firmware.. Seting up in WEP environmnet.. Remote range is somewat limited.. 
Summary:. Waht can I say. This unit has so much to offer that once you have the unit you will be throwing away you DVD players. Pricing is coming down (finally) and this unit is becoming more affordable. The unit offer 1080p uploading for DVD's, Blu-Ray functionality, internet connectivity for Pandora, NextFlix, Blockbuster, and yes , You Tube.. Picture quaility is amazing. Sound quality and surround sound dispersement are awesome.. Set up was somewhat of an issue as the instructions were followed to the letter, but still ran into issues and had to repeat twice before the programming and WEP hex code was accepted.. Like the controls on top right side og f the unit, but find them a little sensitve (but I am nit picking here).. Remote control needs to be pointed directly at the unit with an uninterrupted line a site. This can be an issue when using the remote features especialliny on WiFi apps. (Solution - get a high end universal remote).. Overall we are really impresed with picture quality and sound. I really do not see how this unit can be improved on without being a 3-D system. Would like better range on the remote and less time to complete updates.. I strongly recommend this unit to anyone looking to have the future now.. 

$$;
Pros:. YouTube, USB, AnyNet+. 
Cons:. Fast, reliable, versatile.. 
Summary:. Pricy, but best on the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. THIS UNIT IS VERY FAST, GREAT PICTURE QUALITY, PLAYS TONNES OF VIDEO AND AUDIO FORMATS, SIMPLE TO OPERATE, AND LOVE THE DISCRETE OUTPUTS. GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY. LAN CONNECTION GIVES YOU COSTANT UPDATES AND EASY ACCES TO BD LIVE CONTENT.. 
Cons:. PC STREAMING SETUP A BIT ANNOYING BUT ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE IF YOU LIKE WIRELESS STREAMING OF PHOTOS, MUSIC AND MOVIES FROM YOUR PC.. 
Summary:. I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER REVIEWERS WERE SMOKING WHEN THEY RATED THIS UNIT BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST PLAYER OUT THERE. ( THEY MUST WORK FOR THE COMPETITION !!!) IF YOU WANT A GREAT PLAYER WITH GREAT FEATURES THIS IS THE UNIT.. 

$$;
Pros:. The best features are built in WiFi, onboard memory, and versatile connectivity. Any system will 'play nice' with this unit. Pandora sounds great on my stereo vs. laptop. Netflix is 99% buffer free. Vivid colors w/Blu-ray. The 3600 does what it says.. 
Cons:. Too many Pandora songs start with a beat skip (but no ads). Controls on top of the unit are a minor quirk. A flip down panel on the front would be better. The touch sensitivity redeems that flaw.. 
Summary:. Get this player! The strongest competitor is the PS3. I didn't need gaming, and was looking to save cash. At $300 + tax brand new from ABC Warehouse, the Samsung was the solution. I saw one auctioned new on EBay for $290. Looks shiny/sleek/futuristic.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its been out of the box for two weeks and I love this player. The wireless dongle for Pandora and Netflix is awesome. The sound and video quality are wonderful.. 
Cons:. I've had some trouble with the player needing to be unplugged and then plugged back in for access to Netflix streaming.. 
Summary:. I'd recommend this product. It seems like it delivers in all areas. I got a great price on it when I bundled it with a Samsung ToC tv, so it was entirely worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Fast movie loading (compared to other players and even PS3). - Wifi. - Great image qualiity in Blu-Ray and DVD upconvertion.. 
Cons:. - None so far.. 
Summary:. This is the player that made me forget the PS3 as a blu-ray player.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was fairly easy to set up and the streaming of Netflix and Pandora is pretty smooth. 
Cons:. The buttons on top of the player are hard to see and if I happen to touch one, say the power button, it turns off.. 
Summary:. This is my first experience with a Blu Ray player but I'm a big fan now. Especially because I bought it with a Samsung LN37B650T1 LCD. It's very easy to set up to the TV. It took a little time to get the WiFi working, I had to put the player at the top of my stack of components to get a strong signal. Once connected and the Pandora and NetFlix accounts set up the streaming is great. If you're going to want streaming you may as well go with this player because it has all you need unless your WiFi signal is weak. When we rent a movie on NetFlix you can stop in the middle and come back to it later. The hardest part of this experience was setting up and understanding how NetFlix works.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up from the box. Wifi a breeze. Plays well with Samsung flat-panel. One remote for both T.V. and player. Fast loading, outstanding color and detail.. 
Cons:. A bit delicate in the build. Dust magnet.. 
Summary:. I have been so reluctant to purchase a Samsung Blu-ray player because of their past performance and hit and miss quality and support. Although I haven't had the pleasure of dealing with Samsung's customer/support service like others, I hope it improves if I ever need them.. In any event, I have a PS-3, Sharp Blu-ray player, and now the BD-p3600 and it was easy to set-up out of the box. Wifi connected with no issues; it should make life much easier, and the quality with no compatibly issues at all! It plays well with the Samsung flat panel in the bedroom and no need for 1000 and 1 remotes. Just one!. Color and detail spectacular, no issues with the 24 fps mode or any other enhancement at all. The only thing is that it's a dust magnet and I think that the build quality is a bit to delicate.. Other than that, I'm pleased and glad I bought despite the questionable history with their past players.. 

$$;
Pros:. got it a year ago. Back then, streaming you tube and netflix was awesome! I've moved on to PC streaming now and just download whatever movies i want on my computer and then stream to my big screen. Life is good!. 
Cons:. the first firmware sucked. It was buggy and i would have to cut the player off and back on a couple times. Now its much better but should be mentioned. I don't like that i'm stuck with just netflix, blockbuster, youtube, and pandora. Want hulu.. 
Summary:. all in all, it was a powerhouse when it came out but there are better products out now. I could retract that statement if they would update it to openly surf or at least have more internet options like hulu.. The way i've went around that is downloading torrents to my pc and streaming from there, which is pretty awesome. Just time consuming.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speedy startup times. Beautiful psuedo-piano black finish. PC connected streaming.. 
Cons:. Its a fingerprint magnet as mr. moskovciak stated. The unit i recieved only had select features; in particular, netflix and bloggers.com. The general assumption that if i update it, it will brick itself.. 
Summary:. I purchased this blu-ray player on clearance at B***b** for a fraction of what it originally cost with a little apprehension. Will it work? If i update it will it kill itself? Only reason i say that is for the fact that the last samsung blu-ray player i purchased(bd-p1600) totally and completely died after the usb update. The bd-p3600 seems to work quite well: no jaggies, no problems whatsoever. The best thing to do is to buy last years' technology and save save save!. 

$$;
Pros:. 5.1 surround sound, full HDMI connections and HDTV, you will get the full effect of this BD player. With wireless access you can take advantage of Pandora online music. Wireless connection automatically notifies you of BD firmware updates, IMPORTANT!. 
Cons:. Playback buttons are located on top of unit. However, if you use remote it is not an issue.. 
Summary:. I enjoy the full HD/blu-ray movie experience and Pandora music versatility.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Easy to setup. -Remote control easy to use/operate. 
Cons:. None as of this time. 
Summary:. Great picture through Blu-Ray player with DVDs. Easy to setup Pandora, Netflix with streaming video.. 

$$;
Pros:. I think we use the Netflix more than anything. Streaming videos for super cheap directly to the TV, Woo Hoo! I love this feature. We have had this unit for a couple months and have watched Blu Rays on it, they look great.. 
Cons:. Every once in a while we have to reconnect our blu ray player to the wireless modum. This just involves going into the setting, and searching for motum, but still just a little kink.. 
Summary:. Love the player! Works fine for me 95% of the time.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture of Blu Ray disc (planet earth-for example) with my new Samsung PN50B650 is phenomenal. The styling/appearance of the unit. The Remote. Easy set-up, for my limited use so far. Picture and ease of Netflix streaming. Connectivity w/ PN50B650. 
Cons:. The picture of standard DVD's do not look as good as my older cheap Samsung 1080p player. Probably have not dialed in the settings properly though. No issues whatsoever so far. A little pricey.. 
Summary:. I have had the BD-P3600 a week now, purchased used (barely) on ebay for 212 delivered. I had already hung my new PN50B650 on the wall and connected an HD Antennae and an old cheap Samsung 1080p player. This BD player was a cinch to set up for my limited use. All I had to do was plug in the HDMI from the Plasma TV and run another optical audio to my old Integra 5.5 receiver and a LAN/ethernet cable from my router and that was it. I already had a Netflix account and within two minutes I was streaming in HD and the picture was just spectacular. I really just purchased this unit for two things - #1 for the Netflix streaming and #2 to see if the Blu Ray Disc was really all everyone said it was. The Netflix streaming has made the 212.00 purchase price well worth it. The only Blu Ray disc I have veiwed through the player so far is BBC's "planet earth" and it has made me a beleiver in the whole Blu Ray format. Hopefully the player will keep working and not crash and burn like the poor folks who have posted their woes on the many forums online. A couple other notes: I tried to update the firmware and it is evidently current as of 2-19. I find the remote to be very ergonomic and functional especially it's connectivity with the Samsung TV. The only issue I have so far is that the picture of standard DVD's just does not look as good as on my old 60 dollar Samsung 1080p player from a few years back. I have a suspicion that I just need to dial in the settings different from the factory default settings the player came with. The reason I have not bothered with setting up the player for wireless is lazyness. The way my home theater and home office are set up it is just too easy to run an ethernet cable. Hope this helps and try not to watch TOO MUCH HDTV!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up and get wireless connected (if you simply click on "network" in the network setup screen. Otherwise you have to fill in the various DNS Settings. Upscales DVDs, gets netFlix in HD (as long as it is in that format). 
Cons:. Does make a clunking noise when loading a BR disk - but I am guessing that's the norm.. 
Summary:. Like it - works great for me - but it is only two weeks old. one of the few that is truly wireless ready. If I had it to do over, I'd buy it again.. 

$$;
Pros:. the picture is amazing. First Bluray player and set up was easy including wireless. Love the netflix streaming. Got this as a christmas gift and it has been working like a charm. Very satisfied.. 
Cons:. Long load times would be my only complaint.. 
Summary:. Took me while to adopt Bluray and glad i bought this player. Have found it easy to use and the picture is perfect. Now I just have to upgrade my projector to 1080p. However the picture is still brilliant on my 720.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love that for a great price it comes with so many features like the ready out of the box internet ready hookup to my wireless router. It was such a simple setup to pair it to my router that is WEP 26 byte encryption.Minutes later updated firmware.. 
Cons:. Well I thought about this andit had all the features I wanted and a few more that all work very well so I can't think of any cons to tell the truth.. 
Summary:. I love that when I load a movie in that it takes like 20 seconds to load where my DVD player would take a full minute. It is a qyite Machine. I held out to buying a BR Player until I found a machine that was wireless that would not cost a fortune since with all the changes that are happing the firmware would need frequent updating. As a matter of fact when I finished doing the sync to my wireless router I was nottified that a update was needed. So I hit the upgrade option and it only took like 5 minutes to wireless update my firmware. I then was able to enjoy a trial free period of Blockbuster, Netflix to rent movies online to browse for them and to watch streaming movies that were HD quality since it has a meter that tells me the source signal quality. So as I am waiting to get my movies by mail I am able to stream movies right to my TV with no signal problems at at and it never lags! I also can build radio stations of no commercials based on the type of music I like through Pandora and have it routed to my reciever that siubds awseome. I also used to like to watch Utube stuff on my PC now I can do that with my player just as easy as my PC and I do not have to have my laptop close or be at my desktop. This player also can share files with all my Computers in my my home through the router just like my PC's can so forget needing a smart card slot or burning a cd with Video, pics or music I just hit a button on my BlueRay to access which PC in the house to share folders without having to insert a cd or flash drive(which I still can since it will play my cd's and has a usb port to insert a flash drive so if I just want to pop somethinhg in I am set for that as well! Thids device has finally merged my home theater with the internet so easliy, looks/sounds great and I am excited for what updates are coming down the road that I will be ready for since when I turn on my player I will get a message an update is ready.. I would not heistate if you are looking to buy one, just make sure that it is the 3600 model and not the more expensive models that if you are not real careful reading the features/requirements that you may need to buy a wireless dongle that plugs into the back as an adapter to connect to a router or you will be shelling out 80 to 100 bucks more that you have to order I found out in my research.. Happy Hunting!. Updated. on Feb 3, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. super fast load time. WiFi works great with Netflix.. 
Cons:. I sometimes watch TV series from an external hard drive and getting to it from the menus takes a little time. especially when there is a disc in the player and it automatically starts when powering on.. 
Summary:. This thing looks awesome. I love the buttons on top and the sleek black look. WiFi was easy to set up as long as you read the manual and have your network passkey from the bottom of your wireless router. It is lightning fast compared to the Toshiba HD DVD player I have in the bedroom. I really enjoy the fact that I can watch movies and TV series I have saved on my external hardrive just by plugging it into the front of the player. This is a great player and with the prices finally coming down on Blu ray players you cant beat it for the features. I would highly reccomend this player for anyone who is ready to make the move to Blu ray.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture and fairly easy set-up (but set up also a negative). 
Cons:. Long set-up time as it took a while to get on my home wireless system and VERY long to update firmware. Some remote functions a tad confusing.. 
Summary:. I am glad I bought this despite the negative reviews. I have had no problems. I get a good crisp BluRay picture and good "upconvert" from regular DVD's.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture! Fast Blu-ray movie load times. Netflix internet streaming!!! 7.1 multi-channel audio outputs with built-in decoding for Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. Built-in 1GB memory. Media streaming from a network-connected PC.. 
Cons:. Transport controls on top of player. PC streaming setup is clunky and requires some knowledge of networking and firewalls. Remote control is not very well laid-out and the player does not respond to it unless it is pointed DIRECTLY at the player.. 
Summary:. First, a little bit about my setup. I have a 1080i 61" DLP rear-projection TV and a high-end audio receiver with 6.1 multi-channel audio inputs. The receiver is about 7 years old, so it does not have HDMI connections, but it DOES have optical and coax digital audio inputs. I chose the BD-P3600 over other units because of the fast BD load times, Netflix streaming, PC streaming, and multi-channel analog outputs. I needed the analog outputs in order to take advantage of the latest audio decoding.. The player is connected to the TV with HDMI. It is connected to the audio receiver by digital optical AND multi-channel analog so I can choose which audio output I want to listen to with my receiver's remote control.. I am not using the wireless dongle, so I cannot comment about that. My house is wired with ethernet jacks in every room. (Yes, I'm a geek and I'm proud of it!) My internet service is from Brighthouse networks (cable company) and I have about a 7Mbps download speed and 384Kbps upload speed.. I've read some reviews about the fact that the firmware update can possibly render the player useless. I would recommend to everyone to DOWNLOAD THE FIRMWARE TO YOUR PC and then copy it to a USB flash drive. Insert the flash drive into the player and update the firmware from USB. This will ensure that you do not kill your player due to an unstable internet connection. Oh... and... READ THE MANUAL FIRST!. I was a little concerned about all the negative reviews (on Newegg and other sites) about hardware failures, but I think that people are MUCH more likely to leave a review if they had a complete failure... so I'm hoping I didn't make a bad choice. Plus, those may have been earlier units (never buy a product that just came to market... wait a while). The one I received from Netflix arrived with the latest firmware, which only came out a couple of months ago, so I got a recently-manufactured unit. As for many of the other negative reviews that are complaining about wireless connectivity and other technical setup issues... well there are a lot of people in this world who are not technically inclined, so I wasn't too worried about that.. I have had the player setup for 4 days so far. I've watched four blu-ray movies, one DVD and four Netflix instant movies so far. I must say that the Blu-ray picture quality is stunning. I'm pleasantly surprised about the Netflix picture quality. Three of the four were near-DVD quality... even on a 61 inch screen! As for DVD up-scaling... well, I can't tell the difference between the upscaling performed by the player versus the 480p component output of my DVD changer. I'm thinking that the reason for this is that every non-CRT HDTV automatically scales all video to the display's native resolution. This is true for DLP, LCD, Plasma and LED.. On the down side... The PC streaming setup is cumbersome. However, I have not had a problem with the player losing my username/password as other say they have. Once the PC streaming is setup, it works well. However, I think it would make more sense for this to be added to the e-content menu instead of having to do the automatic search every time I want to use it.. I would like the Netflix menu to have the ability to search for movies directly on the player, but it's no big deal to add them to my queue on the PC and then select them from the queue on the player.. I have not used Pandora yet. I'm sure it will work as well as Netflix.. I have no interest in using the Blockbuster feature since Blockbuster charges for each movie viewed.. The buttons on top of the unit are a little weird. Samsung would have been smarter to put them on the front, making it possible to stack other devices on top of the unit. I'm not sure what they were thinking here.. The remote control is disappointing. I don't like the transport buttons (play, pause, stop, etc). I also really hate the fact that the remote must be pointed directly at the player with absolutely no obstructions. However, this is not too big a problem for me... I have a programmable touch-screen remote. I setup my remote to have all the functions of the original Samsung remote and it works great... I don't need to point the remote directly at the player and it works even though my coffee table is between me and the player.. As for audio... I set the player to convert to DTS on the optical output and this sounds GREAT on my receiver. I also setup the receiver to be able to use the multi-channel analog audio. I'm not so impressed with this option.. However, this may be due to my receiver. I think it outputs the sound without any signal processing so I cannot adust the graphic equalizer for the multi-channel input. It would be nice to have a receiver with HDMI inputs and decoding for the new audio formats, but I'm not going to drop the money to replace the receiver right now.. I'll leave another review later if I experience any of the hardware problems.. Updated. on Jan 25, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Great DVD and Blu-Ray playback. Netflix, YouTube, and Pandora all work wirelessly as advertised.. 
Cons:. Beautiful but slightly impractical case design. Would have liked another USB port.. 
Summary:. I had a few minor problems setting up the wi-fi, but they were the result of my marginal wi-fi skills, not the device. (I stupidly left MAC filtering on my router without adding the new address, was using a channel with a lot of interference, etc). Otherwise, everything that I have tried has worked like a dream! DVD's and Blu-Rays look great and internet streaming works like magic! I haven't tried pc streaming but don't really have any desire to. I was originally cautious about this purchase due to many negative reviews, but have been very happy with my 3600 so far.. 

$$;
Pros:. Design; performance; versatility. 
Cons:. Fingerprints; WiFi setup. 
Summary:. After checking the Samsung website, WiFi setup was a piece of cake, but the manual wasn't entirely accurate. Picture quality is impressive and load time, while faster than other players, still isn't good enough in any player to date. Other than the piano black finish being susceptible to fingerprints, there are no serious complaints to be made.. 

$$;
Pros:. sleek, low-profile, loads disc quickly. 
Cons:. networking setup could be simpler. updating the firmware.. 
Summary:. Overall, I have been happy with this player. The Blu-Ray function is fine, with a great picture and sound - can't imagine how this can be improved upon in more expensive models. Discs load quickly and I haven't experienced any playback issues.. I like the idea of wireless streaming (who doesn't?), though, like most wireless applications not designed by Apple, I ran into some trouble during setup, but it works as expected once that hurdle is overtaken -- no lag, no cutting out, no way to tell it's wireless (unless you have slow internet). I navigated the menu to the wireless setup, entered the network password, which wasn't particularly fun with a 22-digit, 0-9 and aA-zZ style password and only the remote's directional pad and an on-screen keyboard to accomplish the task. Upon its first connection to the internet, it began downloading a firmware update. Of course, after it downloaded, installed and rebooted, it reset the wireless password and I had to re-enter it. Pandora and YouTube are great streaming functions, so far. Netflix requires membership and their lack of titles was disappointing; haven't explored Blockbuster.. I think it's a good value, second-tier player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Set up was a breeze for Network, Pandora, Blockbuster, and Netflix. Quality of BlueRay disc and regular DVDs is superior.. 
Cons:. Updating software/firmware was painful. I have 16MB down network and the system took over 30 minutes to download a 76Mb update. BDLive content is also slow. Audio down sampling was also tricky and a little spotty at times on wireless headphones.. 
Summary:. The load time of the discs are fast, the quality of the audio and video are great. Networking from Samsung really needs to be looked at as I am hardwired in to a 16MB down network and the speed of downloading content such as software/firmware upgrades is very slow. During the first attempt of the upgrade the system lost connection after 20 minutes and I had to start again which worked on the second try. Audio sampling needs a little work. Setting at PCM played fine through Harmon Kardon receiver with HDMI but with the wireless headphones that have optical in I had to down sampled the audio to play which it did but stopped working half way through the movie.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Video and Audio quality, Netflix, YouTube, Pandora Streaming work great. Included Wireless Adapted, fairly easy to setup (&lt;=20 mins) . Unit looks super slick on my media rack.. 
Cons:. PC streaming is a pain to get working and is sketchy at best. The remote is not backlit.. 
Summary:. The samsung BD-P3600 is my first blue-ray player, and so far so good. I have used the unit for Blue-Ray playback and standard dvd playback without issue, and I am impressed by the video quality and audio quality when playing both. Connected to tv via HDMI and was playing dvd's in minutes, setting up player on WIFI took a little effort but nothing crazy, I have a wirless secure network (WEP) and I had it connected and my Netflix account functioning within minutes. The menu on the Netflix is a little dissapointing, my XBox 360 allows you to browse for movies right from the console menu whereas with this machine you can only view movies already in your queue.. The streaming YouTube is neat although I was a little dissapointed with the front end of the YouTube app, I could login with my YouTube account but I am unable to view my youtube subscriptions. Favorites are available and you can browse youtube movies with the DVD remote easily using the # pad in the same way you would a cellphone.. PC streaming is a pain and to this point I still haven't gotten it running yet. I can connect to my PC but can't view any media and the connection falls off an on (PC location unavailable). It is highly irritating. All in all I would say this is an exellent blue ray player that given a more user friendly menu and more accessible PC streaming functionality could've been amazing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Netfliz BD-live with wifi and Blu ray quality all excellent. 
Cons:. Remote is difficult to see in the dark. Setting up the wifi was a little more difficult than it should have been.. 
Summary:. I read 105 of the reviews here AFTER I purchased my samsung and to be honest it scared the heck out of me. Fortunately I've had no problems with any of the features ... the Netflix BD-live with wifi is pretty amazing.. One small undocumented tip that may help others with setting up their wifi is to plug in the adapter AFTER the unit is powered on. For some reason it will not locate the device on boot up .. wifi menu choice under setup will remain un-selectable. When the adapter is detected, the unit sends you right to the wifi network config menu. From there it quickly located my wifi network and after some trial and error, I selected the correct type of security and password for my N-band Netgear wireless router. From there I upgraded the firmware which took about 40 minutes. Once again I had to reconfigure the wifi by unplugging the adapter, turning on the unit and then plugging it back in.. The only concerns I have now are the units reliability as many of the reviews have complained about .. only time will tell.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Reasonable price for the features that you get. (Pandora, Netflix, Youtube, Blockbuster, PC sharing &#38; appox. 1gig of built-in memory). 2. Load up and buffering speed is relatively excellent.. 3. Back panel connection offers digital &#38; analog input. 
Cons:. Networking set-up is for tech-y ones.. Universal remote is not universal enough. 
Summary:. It is an excellent blue-ray player for the price. I would definitely recommend this product... but only to those who can play around networking. Set-up requires prior tech knowledge despite of instructions in the manual.. Video and Audio quality is superb.. Netflix and Pandora is superb as well. (stable internet connection is necessary though.) I can't speak for blockbuster. 'Haven't tried that yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love this blue-ray having Netflix and Pandora really makes this player stand out and with Wifi adapter as a give away cant go wrong with it.. 
Cons:. Only thing I have to say is I wish they upgrade the firmware so I can change different screen saver or bigger album image using pandora.. 
Summary:. I don't know why people keep giving the player bad reviews I think they just cant set up the player correctly. Eveyone just want a $1000 player for $200 come on you get what you pay for and for that amount I am very happy with the product. to all who read this get it its worth every 200 dollars check different places it is lower at different places.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Simple Wi-Fi set-up. It found my router right away and I was connected and updating the firmware instantly.. -Easy to set up Netflix and Pandora. -Plays Blu-Rays quietly and quickly. -YouTube is great!. 
Cons:. -Network function not Mac friendly. I am kind of use to this by now but a firmware upgrade could fix that up...no?. -Controller sucks. Button layout isn't great and controller doesn't always worked when used from side of player. 
Summary:. Man alive, the reviews for this player are SCATHING. I guess I consider myself lucky that I picked this up over the summer to use for my upstairs TV (basically the one always playing kids movies). We haven't had a problem with it yet. Great performance. Great Wi-Fi streaming speed. Netflix works good. Pandora works as well. I don't use it because I normally stream it from iPhone to the stereo, but I have tried it out and you won't be dissapointed if you are looking forward to it.. I know you can network in this player to your computer to stream some of your music, photos and videos. I have a Mac though so it didn't work. I did have an extra external hard drive. I hooked it up the additional USB port and my problem was solved.. My main issue is with the controller. You literally have to be sitting smack dab in front of the player for it to always to work. We have our upstairs LCD on a swivel wall mount because that floor has an open floor plan so there is never any telling where you will be watching from. So sometimes if we are sitting in a certain spot off to the side, the remote won't work. We then have to get up and use it. Not sure if it is the remote itself or the sensor on the player. One day I'll try a universal remote to see if that helps.. Overall though, I really like this player. You can't ignore these other reviews here. And God know if I had seen them BEFORE I bought it, well, I may have never even taken the plunge. Well, I did buy it and for me it has worked out fine now since I bought it in June.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Quality on bluRay, Netflix,Pandora, and Youtube. Loads Fast, and great look.. 
Cons:. Blockbuster on demand seems to have not been thought out well.. 
Summary:. Had it for two weeks now. Plays blu Ray Discs great. Load times are great. Netflix works better than I expected. Youtube works great.. Took me 30 minutes to setup the wireless and update the firmware. As long as your Wireless name has no spaces it works great. Have played several BDDVD and DVD discs and the upconvert on DVD's works great. My Toshiba Upconvert DVD player did well with DVD's but this seems to have a better audio quality. The streaming media from the PC works fine... you just need to know your IP address and have the folder you want to view shared on your PC. I think the new firmware has made a lot of changes... since it saves my IP address and my user and folder name for the media streaming now... so far I have streamed Music, Pictures, and Video (Divx) with no problems. Also I love that Pandora radio is included... I have my channels on my Ipod touch and they carry over to my account on my BD Player. Bought Refurbished from Internet for 199.99. 

$$;
Pros:. slim design, easy to navigate menus. 
Cons:. a little slow to pick-up my wireless connection. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to set up, great picture on both Blu Ray Discs and standard DVD. I had it out of the box and had it up and running, Netflix, Pandora, YouTube, within 20 minutes. 
Cons:. None so far.... 

$$;
Pros:. I had been looking for a way to play movies and music from my computer without having to move the computer in the living room. This device woorked great after disabling my firewall. The Blueray player is excellent.. 
Cons:. None so far.. 
Summary:. More to come after I've had it for a few months. 

$$;
Pros:. Loads very fast, love the wireless, using the7.1 output works great. 
Cons:. it forgets the wireless pass code to log on the network. 
Summary:. if your looking for a player with 7.1 output it is the best. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent blu ray w/1080p 24f. Superior DVD upconversion to my Oppo HD-980. Supports dominant lossless HD audio output.. Wirelessly streamed Nettlix and Pandora I use all the time. Lightning fast bootup. 
Cons:. Need stop disk each time I startup player to access Netflix or Pandora-not sure if there is workaround.. Correcting dark level on my Sony XBR4 LCD is required for me to get the same darkness, saturated look from Samsung pictures as I got on my Oppo.. 
Summary:. This is an incredible addition to a home theatre if you can handle HDMI for Audio and Video. As discussed in Audioholics forums, the difference between Blu Ray images is minimal comparing major blands with HDMI 1080p/24f output. My Denon benefits audibly from the Dolby TrueHD and DTS Master Audio that this player supports, since it has better D/A converters than I am likely to find in most Blu Rays. I am not thinking that analogue output (D/A in the Blu Ray and analogue circuit) will be as good as the competitors but this is frankily outdated technology.. The darkness of the image is not matched to my Oppo DVD player (the same is posted on internet as being case with this vs. Oppo Blu Ray). That means that the image is imperfect out of the box. That said, the detail and 3-dimensionality of this player exceeded my beloved Oppo 980's DVD upconversion which is to say that this player has serious upconversion capability that means that DVDs are not relegated to the rubish bin.. Pandora and Netflix streaming are addictive. To be able to wirelessly stream to my nice home theatre system really completes my AV experience.. Loadup time is incredibly fast, comparable to DVD players I've owned. There are things my last player did which this player doesn't try to (save your location on disk for when you reinsert a disk, region-free, SACD) but barring these types of items, I find this to be one of those AV purchases that exceeded my expectations.. I haven't noticed any lipsync. I have seen some artifacts in blu ray (moving lines) that I think looked like 3/2 Pulldown artifacts, so I will have to doublecheck that it remembers to use 1080p24f output mode.. The buttons are not problematic for me. They operate with a slight touch. I am not thinking the Disc transport is the strongest I have ever seen but it looks less flimsy than my Oppo's. The plastic of the player I think will not last as well (scratches, etc) as other appliances I have owned, but if it looks ugly I will still love it if it can do what it has done thus far.. There are lots of complaints regarding setup of Router. I found it problematic only if I tried to use static IP and then tried to go back to dynamic IP (had to delete all values in the static IP I had entered even though one would assume that info was no longer being used). Still, I think the player itself is not problematic in this regard, it was really my ignorance.. There are also alot of complaints regarding reliability. Having owned it for about 1 month now, I am still in the honeymoon phase. As an attempt to mitigate my risk I have bought from Best Buy and gotten extended warranty.. 

$$;
Pros:. A seemingly small but very helpful feature is that the BD remote works the Samsung LED TV. They interact automatically. Simple Netflix and Pandora operation. Intuitive setup menus. No problems whatsoever with DVD or Bluray discs.. 
Cons:. Worked by Ethernet, but didn't work wirelessly with my old Apple Extreme Base Station. A new ($100) Apple Extreme solved the problem. Some "Watch Instantly" Netflix movies have that annoying 1/4 second delay -- others don't.. 
Summary:. This was recommended by the salesman when I recently bought a Samsung LED flatpanel. I'm glad he did. I suppose most players will deliver excellent picture quality, but the ease of use and the intuitive, integrated controls (when used with the LED TV) set this unit apart. This is the Apple to all the others' PCs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent load time, picture and audio quality. Great interface to Pandora and Netflix.. Direct ethernet connection to network works flawlessly.. 
Cons:. Wireless is a nightmare. Sent back to factory for a 'Software change and modification'. Wireless disconnects when turned off. Takes time to 'initilize network' after power on. Still have had no success with streaming from a 'shared folder' on a PC.. 
Summary:. Great unit overall. If Samsung can fix the network problems, this unit would be outstanding.. 

$$;
Pros:. It worked well for its core task, and Netflix and Pandora support are good. Top-mounted controls worked fine.. 
Cons:. 3 problems: 1. on a DVD, it had trouble navigating to a specific track through the DVD's submenu. 2. It couldn't find a multiword WiFi network. "Apple Network XYZ" showed as just "Apple" 3. Netflix streaming needed better bandwidth than low-end DSL. 

$$;
Pros:. see below for my question. 
Cons:. See below for my question. 
Summary:. I have not purchased this unit due to the fact that i have read on Neweggs site that one experienced computer user said that the wireless network would not connect to his router due to his firewall. The correct ports etc were enabled. SAMNSUNG told him the only way to connect is to TURN OFF FIREWALL. Turning off a firewall to stream Netflix movies is not acceptable. Not to loose security on your wireless network.. Has anybody else had this same problem? Please respond if you have. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture, subtitle button on remote, vivid colors, Pandora is great.. 
Cons:. Set up is difficult. Netflix streaming is in on 4:3 format. ; I connected BD-P3600 to Onkyo SR 875 amplifier and then to Panasonic TH-58px600U via HDMI. Music is disconnected when tv is turn off to listen music through the amplifier without tv on.. 
Summary:. Overral the player is excellent.. 

$$;
Pros:. PC-Streaming, plays DIVX/XVID, JPEG slide shows with MP3,. 
Cons:. It won't play XVID-HD. Nor will it play video with DTS-ES audio.. It has playlist abilities but it won't save them.. 
Summary:. Unlike others I found it extremely easy to setup Wi-Fi, and streaming audio, video and pictures from my PC is great. The "slideshow" feature when playing music files is great, slideshows all the pictures in the same folder as mp3 file. Quick loading of BluRay disc. Plays DIVX/XVID from disc or PC, unfortunately no support for XVID-HD. All in all I like this player, it's my first blu-ray player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Netflix, Pandora, and Blockbuster streaming. PC streaming.. 
Cons:. Glossy finish and buttons on top make it difficult to integrate into equipment rack. Lack of Slacker radio. 
Summary:. After being disappointed with the fact that my bd-p1600 would do everything great except play bluray disks, I returned it. I was left with the decision of a sony 4600 or this player as an open box deal at 150. Having read that the Sony's Netflix streaming had issues, I thought I would try my luck with another samsung. When got home I read a the reviews that had me scared of a repeat. I updated the firmware and gave it a go. So far I have had no issues, load times are good, no freezing (I did have that issue with the 1600) I have yet to stream movies from a computer but I did try pics and music. I had a few issues with songs skipping but i think that was more to do with the host computer. The shape of the player and the buttons being on top , combined with the lack of ability to load disks if the unit were on its side leave physical integration choices limited. For the $150 I payed, I think this is a great unit but for th $199+ that it sells for new currently, I think a ps3 or lesser priced player would be a better option..

Pros:. Versatile all in one solution for Blu-ray, DVD, and streaming video.. 
Cons:. Does not support Hulu and the Netflix stream sometimes looses sound.. 
Summary:. It is very fast a loading Blu-ray disks and the Netflix HD streams look beautiful.. 

$$;
Pros:. Connection with Samsung TV is excellent. The units almost act as one.. 
Cons:. Menu layouts need redesign. Major issues getting connected to folder on PC to stream content..

$$;
Pros:. Excellent image and sound as to be expected with many Blu-Ray players. Network setup was a cinch. Love the built in Netflix and Pandora. Plus using it to access files on my network computers is awesome.. 
Cons:. Some files it "supposedly" reads it doesn't. Does NOT play most recently converted Divx files, apparently it will play older versions of Divx. Outside of that have had zero issues with this player and highly recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good visual quality, excellent stereo. 
Cons:. Slow operations. Netflix streaming a hassle. 
Summary:. The player?s visual quality is good but almost every operation or command took a little time to get executed. Netflix loading has been a trouble. But when it flows, it glides well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Blu-ray picture; Loads relatively fast; Wi Fi ; streaming Netflix and Youtube.. 
Cons:. Expensive. Reliability. First player had to be returned because it kept freezeing up or the picture wouldn't display properly. Second one doesn't do it as much. If i reinstall disc it will play properly. Still debating if i should return this one..

Summary:. EQUIPMENT:. Outlaw Audio 950 Control Amp. Outlaw Audio Model 200 Power Amps. Panasonic TH-50PZ800U HDTV. Legacy Audio Speaker System. MODEL: BD-P3600 XAA. S/W: Bev2.05_091015_XAA. LOADER: LDv1.12_090924_. REGION: A/1 (BD/DVD). I purchased this unit as an upgrade to my Home Theater System (HTS). It replaced my Oppo HD-981 up-converting DVD player. My experience with the unit has been mixed.. Video for the unit is connected via its HDMI output to the Panasonic HDTV. It is connected to the Outlaw Pre-Amp via its analog outputs for audio. My HTS is set up as a 5.1 system using Legacy Audio speakers.. The picture quality is outstanding. The up-conversion of DVDs is equivalent to that of my Oppo unit, and the Blu-ray picture is detailed and vibrant. Dark scene contrast is outstanding as viewed on the Panasonic HDTV.. Other than adding Blu-ray functionality, my reason for purchasing this particular unit was because it has analog outputs that allow me to use the unit with my current equipment to enjoy the new HD audio formats (decoded within the BD-P3600 and output via the analog outputs). The new HD sound formats dwarf all the previous formats. The sound is clear, full, and deep.. As much as I ?initially? enjoyed the unit, it has had problems playing back some Blu-ray titles. I had menu issues while viewing My Bloody Valentine, Crank, Chrysalis and The Haunting in Connecticut (used convoluted key sequences to get movies to play). The movies Tropic Thunder (unit continually searched at about 30 and 90 minute marks and would not play rest of movie) and Star Trek Original Motion Picture Collection-Disc 1 (picture froze at ~2.03.42 mark, but audio continued) froze during playback. I tried multiple copies of some of these discs with the same results.. In addition to the Blu-ray issues, I am having problems with the Wi-Fi link dropping during streaming playback from NetFlix. When I first purchased the unit, everything worked fine until an upgrade to FW V2.03 was pushed wirelessly to the unit. None of the 30 or so movies I streamed failed before the firmware update, but all of the streamed movies that have been played after the update have failed approximately 40-minutes into playback. Subsequent firmware updates (Currently at V2.05) DID NOT address the problems! I tried stopping/restarting movie, fast forwarding (&gt;&gt;), skip (&gt;&gt;|), powering player off/on, and resetting the player. None of these worked. These problems also only begin to occur after the FW upgrade to V2.03. FW V1.03 or V1.04 are the last versions that operated correctly for me. Customer Support has been of ?little? use. I have ?downgraded? my FW to V1.03. The wireless link stays up and subsequent Blu-ray discs have played just fine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Having never owned a Bluray before and knowing very little about them, what attracted us was the NETFLIX feature.. LOVE all the features this device has!. 
Cons:. EVERY time you want to access one of the network features you MUST enter your WEP key. My WEP is 30 characters long and it's easy to make a mistake inputting the key. The unit turns itself off when not engaged dropping your information PAIN IN BUTT. 
Summary:. Love the features, hate the networking setup!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good initially. Good picture quality. Easy setup.. 
Cons:. Accepted latest firmware. Then I could no longer connect to my network.Support. said I was supposed to accept upgradeONLYwhen having trouble.They would not even consider replacing though upgrade broke the thing. I am very unhappy.&gt;2 wks for repair.. 
Summary:. Worked well. Fried by upgrade. Poor response from support on a problem caused by their upgrade.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice menu layout. OK remote control layout. HDMI auto programed both my TV and Player to work together. Beautiful unit. Netflix works great. Netflix WIFI signal quality bar is useful.. 
Cons:. No step back frame by frame shuttle. All 5 Blu-Ray disks I played didn't resume after I would stop during the movie. Wish remote would light up for dark room viewing. Too close to PS3 pricing.. 
Summary:. I started my switch to Blu-Ray when I wanted to enjoy Netflix streaming while I was waiting a few days for my Netflix to arrive in the mail. I went to get a cheaper Insignia Wi-Fi player from a BestBuy near me, but they didn't carry them at that location. So I decided to try the Samsung, especially after I saw that they had Blockbuster, YouTube, and Pandora on it. After using it for the first time, I started my list of complaints. It wasn't too clear on how to set up the network. As soon as I plugged it in, it found my signal and downloaded over 5 minutes of updates. I thought that was it, until I couldn't get it connected for anything else. I had to fish through a few complicated settings menus before I got it working. I then linked it to my Netflix account and was immediately impressed and was jumping for joy. It was better quality than any Premium On-Demand from my local cable company. Though not near HD quality, it was the full 16:9, not stretched, aspect ratio and very clear. I also like the meter as it was loading a stream that would let me know how the quality will be, due to the Wi-Fi signal strength. I never got better than about 60% quality, but even that looked great. A few times when it was down to about 40%, I opened a door, or reset my modem/router and it went back up to 60%. I?m sure if I plugged it in directly to the router, it would go up, but I haven tried it because of my set up and distance to router. The Wi-Fi antenna on the rear of the unit didn?t work any different with or without the elbow attached, but I kept it extended out just in case it got a tad better signal. Everything was acceptable so far and then some of my Blu-Ray?s came in the mail. Quality wasn?t much different from DVD, so I wasn?t too impressed thus far. Then as I started shuffling, stopping, and pausing, I started my list if complaints. Why didn?t it frame by frame in reverse? How come when I stopped the disk, it always started back at the beginning of the disk (from Load, to Previews, to Menu, to Beginning of the film.) The manual said that ?not all disks resume? but I tried 5 other disks and the same happened. All were new, popular blockbuster movies too. Then I read that pressing stop 2x removes the ?resume? function. But each disk I put in, I didn?t touch stop more than once and it never ?resumed.? So I?m a little confused if it is the unit or Blu-Ray technology? Also, why is there popping sound through the speakers as the disk is loading?. All this was enough to want to return the unit. I figured if Blu-Ray sucked this bad, I?d get a cheaper Insignia unit and mostly use it for Netflix, have the bonus of a Blu-Ray player, but go back to my Sony DVD player. I exchanged it for the Insignia NS-WBRDVD. This unit connected to the internet faster, but had the same issues as the. Samsung, only it has a few more things to complain about like the stupid light on the Wi-Fi antenna that illuminates a dark room, no signal strength/quality meter, and no universal remote. Now it?s day two with the Insignia and I?m looking to exchange it yet again. I just found out PS3 has Netflix with a disk upgrade that?s free from Netflix. I?m going to try that one next, since I?ve been so happy with my SONY?s in the past, the DVP-NC875V being the best unit I?ve ever owned. These other company?s should study Sony?s remote control layout. I can use it blindfolded in the dark, it make that much sense. I?m of course going to add the optional remote to the PS3, as a game control is no way to shuttle around a Movie.. 

$$;
Pros:. Set up Netflix using wireless dongle. Worked flawlessly! Plays Netflix "streaming" movies nicely @ regular DVD quality. Simple to use! Blu-ray movie quality is spectacular in "crispness" of images. WOW.... 
Cons:. Having same problem with the BD-P3600 as I had with the entry level Samsung Blu-ray player. Blu-ray disks tend to "hangup" requiring power-down &#38; restarting of the movie. Sometimes it still hangs-up. Sometimes in same place, sometimes different spots. 
Summary:. I'm not convinced that the technology of either the disks or the players is quite ready yet!!! The problems I'm having, with (multimal movies), is reminiscent of the original Phillips "Laser Disk" players. They would "hang-up" frequently. Expensive Toy!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice design; good picture quality and well designed setup screen. 
Cons:. The streaming of movies from Netflix using Wi Fi home network has bugs. 
Summary:. One of the major reasons I purchased this Blue Ray player is the capability of streaming movies from Netflix. Samsung is touting the easy and smooth ability to stream Netflix movies as a major selling point. They advertise it in every DVD envelope from Netflix. Every time I want to stream a movie from Netflix I have to reset the Blue Ray player's memory by unplugging it for 20 seconds; otherwise I get the error "NETFLIX IS TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE...." What really disappointed me is that when I contacted Samsung, the support tech did exactly what I was afraid he would do and tried to shift the responsibility to my router. My router (which was recommended at Best Buy for linking to the BD 3600) is working fine and I can stream movies via the router to my PC. The fact is that the only thing I need to do is reset the Blue Ray player clearly show that the bug is in the player; yet Samsung is shifting the responsibility. It looks like Samsung was in a rush to hit the market with some new capabilities before the product was thoroughly tested.. 

$$;
Pros:. Includes a variaty of features including LAN, WiFi and Internet access supporting on demand services. Fast loading and good picture quality.. 
Cons:. Wifi dongle is not always part of the package you purchase. Shaky Wifi implementation in particular if you have WPA2, MAC filter, Hide SSID enabled. Does not support LAN streaming from NAS shares but PCs as of today. A firmware fix might help. 
Summary:. Good device but a little overpriced considering the unstable Wifi access and missing NAS streaming support. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast BD load times and excellent features. Player offers DTS HD-Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD onboard decoding, Netflix, Pandora, and PC streaming, ease of use and set up, and an included Wifi dongle (an $80 value).. 
Cons:. Wifi and PC streaming don't work well. Also, 24fps only works with Blu-ray playback and not with DVDs! Panasonic's players let you turn 24fps on for DVDs - why not Samsung? Samsung customer support did not have answers or solutions for my issues.. 
Summary:. A good player if fast load times, onboard decoding of major audio formats, Netflix, and Pandora are desired. Online content works really well through a wired connection.. However, if wireless connectivity and PC streaming are important, you will be dissapointed - as will be the case if you're looking to watch your DVD movies in 24 frames. When I asked Samsung's tech support about this, they "corrected" me by saying that 24fps ONLY relates to BD playback, not DVD...go figure!!. The BD-P1600 offers the same features and performance, minus the included dongle and PC streaming (which do not work anyway) and is $100 cheaper. And you can always buy the dongle if WiFi connectivity is desired, since the 1600 is compatible with it. But that also does not have 24 fps for DVD playback. Panasonic's BD players are similarly priced and could be other options, because they are equally quick, have better DVD playback/upconversion, and allow 24 fps across the board - however, they don't offer Netflix and Pandora.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and much faster than most Blue Ray Players.. 
Cons:. Lousy WiFi set up. I have an Apple Airport Extreme, and have 6 other items that receive WiFi signal with no problem. I can not get this player to accept wifi. Not even with help of Samsung or Apple Tech who I spent hours on the phone with.. 
Summary:. I will probably return since the wifi capability was the only reason I purchased it in the first place.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wi Fi! Netflix streaming. Pandora radio.. 
Cons:. Component video output initialization problem. Audio and video out of sync. Not able to control picture size, i.e. zoom and stretching.. 
Summary:. My biggest problem is getting my component output to start working. The HDMI works correctly on my small monitor but I am using an older HDTV with component input. I have to push a memorized sequence of buttons while the display is blank to get a picture. This took several hours of troubleshooting to figure out.. While streaming Netflix, the audio is very out of sync on some shows compared to viewing on my computer. There is no way to adjust it because the audio is frequently delayed. This is annoying when viewing music performances. Also when viewing Netflix older shows that were filmed in 4:3 ratio, the player stretches the picture. I would rather have black bars on the sides than distorting the picture.. The Wi Fi setup went flawlessly, much to my surprise! The picture qual is great. Be sure to change default settings for audio and video which are dumbed down to the lowest denominator.. Updated. on Mar 26, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Great connectivity between samsung products. fast startup time. good picture quality. 
Cons:. Wifi setup is difficult for the average user. the auto connect feature for pc connection is very poor. choppy playback of mkv files over wifi. video stops after a minute of being paused for pc streaming videos. fast forward for pc streaming too slow. 
Summary:. I wouldn't pay more than $100 for this blue-ray player. I payed $300 and I've regretted it ever since. Use a media extender if you're intending to use this player for pc streaming. Otherwise it works well for dvd and blue-ray playback.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture quality, easy installation except for PC streaming, wireless capability. 
Cons:. HORRIBLE!!! PC MEDIA streaming feature.. So PATHETIC that it shouldn't even be included on the feature list.. Technical Support i Pathetic when comes to problem solving.. Hangs when playing DVDs often. 
Summary:. HORRIBLE!!! PC MEDIA streaming feature.. So PATHETIC that it shouldn't even be included on the feature list. I have had this product for some time now.. but to get its PC Streaming feature to work on a wireless network is a nightmare. I haven't seen so erratic machine in my life.. for a minute it picks up the PCs and next minute it wouldn't if you get it to locate your PC it is not necessary that it would pick up shared media files... Every time you add or delete media files or update firmware or software.. you have to reset everything all over again.. and believe you might land up spending entire day for it to set up and still may not work. Technical Support themselves do not know how to make it work and often blame it on firewalls... windows and anything that they can..It is just a blue ray player like any other player. TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE FEATURES IT CLAIMS TO HAVE BUT NOT REALLY WORK SUCH AS PC STREAMING.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek design. Fast load times compared to most Blu-Ray players. Great Image quality. Great Sound quality. Amazing range of features. Easy to set up. Well laid out main menu setting. Ability to stream media wireless. Netflix/blockbuster compatible. 
Cons:. Poor software functionality. Poorly designed settings menus. Poor wireless connectivity. Poor functionality. Frustrating firmware updates. 
Summary:. I was initially very happy with my purchase of the BD-P3600 blu-ray player. The player was easy to set up for the most part. Although the Wireless connection settings are horrible to navigate, and quite possibly one of the worst layouts of any electronic device I have ever seen or purchased. Once you get past wasting an hour of your life typing in your WPA2 encryption password the player functions well. The player also does not store your wireless settings and does not reconnect automatically once it looses your wireless settings. You will find yourself resetting up your wireless settings almost every time you turn on the BD-P3600. This isn't too awful once you get used to the wireless setting. It's annoying and frustrating to use the wireless settings every time. Setting up and pandora , and Net-flix streaming was very easy, and streaming data plays fine. I didn't experience any lag, or buggy problems as users have reported on the internet. Movies take a bit of time to load, but the image quality and sound are amazing. Once you see a movie on the player the wireless settings really don't seem too awful.. The real problems came when I started updating the firmware. It seems that every time I sit down to watch a movie that there are firmware updates. I think it's great that I'm able to update my firmware so easily, but do we really need firmware updates every month? The updates take at absolute minimum of half an hour to install. Then when the firmware is completely updated, and the blu-ray player restarts and you'll find yourself reconfiguring all of the settings all over again.... including the intolerable wireless settings. When I updated to the latest firmware updates (2.05) the BD-P3600 unexpectedly crashed. I waited 2 1/2 hours for the player to finish installing the update. My pop-corn was gone, and I was fighting with my GF at this point. I finally gave up, and was forced to pull the power despite the warnings of permanent hardware damage in the manual, and on the installation screen. I restored power and restarted the player. Luckily there was no damage, and the updated firmware was working just fine. The only loss was the hours of my life wasted waiting for firmware updates to complete. This is not acceptable, and has permanently altered my opinion of Samsung products. This isn't a a cheap product, and comes with all the features I desired. In the end the player works great when it works at all.. Based on this product alone I don't think I would buy another Samsung product after experiencing the BD-P3600. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and sound. Netflix, pandora, you tube streaming. wifi. Plays DivX format. 
Cons:. Could never get the PC networking to work. Audio wouldn't work sometimes. CD tray wouldn't open sometimes. Need to re-enter wifi WEP after firmware upgrades. No Hulu like another wifi player I looked at. Warranty should include parts AND labor for a year. 
Summary:. Do not rely on old reviews of this player, the player is only 8 months old so look at the most recent reviews to get an idea of how this thing is working.. I had to send back my player after less than 7 months due to the Audio randomly not working and the CD tray sometimes not opening. Both problems resolved by turning the unit off then back on. What $350 player has a mechanical problem like the tray not being able to open.. I could never get the PC networking to work properly. Review by excelart on June 23rd tells how to do this and the steps sound ridiculous.. I paid over $300 for a unit that has multiple problems, if I were you I would either not buy this unit, try the 4600 model (which may be just a risky) and definitely don't pay over $200 for this unit. It is not everything it claims to be.. I gave this a 2.5 star rating, which I'll stick by for now for this marginal unit. However, I may decrease that if other problems start occurring.. Have requested a new unit, but I don't think samsung would do that. They did extend the labor warranty by 3 months, however I am out of that window and will need to pay for labor for an almost brand new $350 blu-ray player. Wow, way to really stand by your equipment samsung.. 

$$;
Pros:. great videos for blue ray, easy to use. 
Cons:. Samsung BD 3600 from Best Buy. played for 40 days. it froze up and screen turned green. Samsung support recommended to run a patch. they are to send me. still waiting 10 days later.. 
Summary:. if i had to do over again i would buy a different blue ray player other than the samsung player. like blue ray play station. more uses other than dvd player, not much more costly than unit purchased.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick, good video quality, sleek design.. 
Cons:. Netflix streaming worked once and never again.. 
Summary:. If you are looking for netflix streaming I would stay away from ALL Samsung players.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays DivX and MP4 files; relatively easy to set up wireless network; excellent picture quality; decent menus and setup.. 
Cons:. Freezes up in two fun ways: (1) when streaming any file, it freezes about 5 minutes in and must be powered down; and (2) it stops working sometimes and must be power dumped and/or reset.. 
Summary:. I love this unit...when it works. I've had 2 major crashes, when it stopped working altogether and refused input from the remote. I went online and chatted with a Samsung rep, and both times, I was able to get it working again. One time I had to do a hard reset, and another time I had to do a power dump, which also involved powering down my modem/network. Most frustrating is attempting to stream content over the network: it skips and/or freezes, usually about 5 minutes in, and I must shut off the unit, then restart, sometimes as many as 4 times before it mysteriously begins working again. One of my big crashes occurred during an autoupdate, but I have had two other uneventful autoupdates, so I don't know whether they are causally linked. When it goes down, it goes down hard, and it is supremely annoying to correct: manual, Samsung Web site, chat is the order of business, and then of course you have to set up your network all over again. Basically the unit is unreliable, and people who just want to plug something in and have it work ought not own it. I'm willing to put in the time and effort to fix it because it's less work than returning it or sending it for repair, and I really want/need the ability to play DivX and MP4. Side note: if you own other Samsung products, the remotes may get confused. Further, I was unable to set the Blu-ray player to another remote because I could never find the correct frequency. I've never owned a piece of equipment that made me scream so much in sheer annoyance and frustration.. 

$$;
Pros:. netflix is nice. 
Cons:. All this firmware nonsense. Will play dvd's but not Blu-rays and I have even uploaded new firmware.. 

$$;
Pros:. Netflix, online streaming.. 
Cons:. Moves slow. Always has to be restarted. Overpriced.. 
Summary:. Save money and buy another reliable player. I have had it for 9 months and it never seems to work right. If it worked right, this would be an awesome player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture, Great Sound, Fast Loading Times, Great Online Content, Easy Setup. 
Cons:. Stopped working after 3 months. 
Summary:. I bought this from Best Buy and it worked great for 3 months, very fast loading, great pic, great sound. Then it started freezing up on me. Really Long story short, don?t buy this player!!. 

$$;
Pros:. picture quality. 
Cons:. firmware updates crash. RMA. Their download just locked up system. Very poor support. Took 2 months for a swap. Sent model BD1600 back and then lost it. Right thing would have be to upgrade unit to BD4600. Didn't hold my breath. Going Sony next time.. 
Summary:. Bad Firmware, Support etc takes Samsung out of the Blur-Ray picture.. 

$$;
Pros:. Streaming looks great. Blu Ray looks great. Dvds look much better than with the original player.. 
Cons:. Always freezes. Needs to be turned off and on several times to make it work. This is the second unit , the first one froze on second day and had to return to Best Buy. Just did the software update and now it is not responding to the remote.. 
Summary:. Fantastic when it works. It should be assumed that you can just turn it on and the unit will work. Am i asking too much? Im thinking of just tossing this in the trash and looking for something that works.. 

$$;
Pros:. Really like the Netflix interface. 
Cons:. Had to off/on every-time to get the remote top work. Froze during downloaded previews, a great idea.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the wi-fi N capability and the built-in Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, and Blockbuster features. Nice looking unit with a capable remote.. 
Cons:. Despite being well reviewed by Cnet, with my new 120Hz LG LCD television I have had dozens of freezes with Blu-ray disks, lots of stuttering during DVD and blu-ray playback and poor video quality overall: artifacts, aliasing, stutters, etc.. 
Summary:. I returned this player while it was still within the allotted return window and will avoid Samsung players in the future. I am planning on replacing this with an LG BD390 (if I can find one since as of 1/22/2010 they were discontinued by LG - new model to replace it).. 

$$;
Pros:. Haven't used it enough to know. Please see summary below. 
Cons:. Haven't used it enough to know. Please see summary below. 
Summary:. I spent 6 hours just trying to get it to play a movie. All I had to do was hit ENTER instead of PLAY. 6 of Samsung's technical people were apparently not aware of this as they had me download software, etc., etc.. Finally, the guy at Crutchfield.com solved the problem. The Samsung book said to hit PLAY; this was wrong!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and streaming from Pandora and Netflix when it works.. 
Cons:. CVE Warranty service is a joke!!!. 
Summary:. Unit work for 2 months befor I updated firmware. From that point entire screen went blank. Unit sent to CVE and returned 2wks later. Watch a movie for 5mins before screen started to fade in and out. Unit sent back to CVE for another 2 weeks. Again returned with the same problem still occurring. Samsung policy is they will not exchange unit until its been service three x3. I called CVE and spoke with their customer service department. There technician commented they could not find a problem with the unit. Recommend customer track connection or cable. HOW STUPID!! Do you think I take pleasure in boxing/shipping my unit off every couple of weeks. The cable and connection was the first thing I checked. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Samsung products. Becuase of Samsung's horrible warranty service I purchased a different model LED TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. stylling; wifi Netflix movies streaming.. 
Cons:. terrible remote;refuses to play some dvds and music cds.. 
Summary:. I am now on my 3rd remote which seems to work ok as long as you don't get more than 6 foot away from the unit and aim it exactly. The fist two remotes required excessive force (as if the buttons weren't making contact) and then required several mashes for results. My Logitech universal remote works flawlessly with the unit.. the unit displays the anti piracy notice and then simply doesn't go any further. Turning machine off and restarting from scratch doesn't help. This includes the entire Andy Richter series and the just released "Baader Meinhof complex" Both played flawlessly on my computer.. Customer service. Or lack thereof. Bottom line seemed to be "we don't have a clue so send it in (at your expense) and we'll check it out. Not the sort of response that makes you want to buy another Samsung product. I'm buying the Oppo bdp83 and hoping I can sell the Samsung Lemon. e that. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice design, easy to connect with just one HDMI cable, excellent picture compared to going from DVD to Blu Ray.. 
Cons:. Connectivity to my top of the line wireless network was unable to connect to the player. Very loud annoying tone emits at random when fast forwarding, pausing, etc. Function screen froze up after 30 minutes out of box.. 
Summary:. CNET must get a tested product from the manufacturer because after everything I've researched on here and what other consumers have gone through with off the shelf players, I went ahead and purchased one from Best Buy only to be disappointed like many before me. After 6 hours from the time I purchased it, I am packing it back into its box and taking it back. I thought about going with an LG but I'm not sure if it's just the technology of all the products on the market, or just a few that haven't been perfected for things such as Netflix.. Let's set aside the wireless connectivity for Netflix, Youtube, and such, because even as a stand alone Blu Ray player, I encountered problems with it. While setting it up for my network connection, the screen froze up and the remote control became useless. I placed a movie in it and it loaded up, but then the function screen did not match what was actually occurring. While playing the movie I pressed stop and it did not stop the movie. I pressed FFWD and it didn't do anything. The function screen didn't even display "Playing." It displayed "Open" even thought the tray was closed and the movie was playing. The only way to stop the movie was by powering it down, then powering it back on.. After powering down the player, disconnecting everything, and waiting ten minutes, I was was able to get it working properly, however, there was a continuous annoying high pitched tone when FFWD, Pause, Stop, were activated. At times just as others have stated before, the audio stopped matching the video so it appeared you were witnessing a poorly dubbed Kung Fu flick. I was very reluctant to purchase a Blu Ray player because of the many problems with not just the Samsung BDP3600, but with a wide range of all the different models on the market today. There is a printed flyer included in the box which refers to information about updating firmware, where to get it, how to do it. I'm sorry, but It's a brand new item out of the box and I have to update software?. I really, really, wanted this product to work for me because the picture quality and sound are what makes watching movies on Blu Ray such an eye appealing experience. The Netflix, Youtube, and other features are such great ideas that I was also looking forward to experiencing, only to be disappointed by the malfunctions of this player. On this item, I believe the user rating is more accurate than CNETS. I will continue to research and shop for a reliable player because going back to DVD is out of the question. Hope this helps anyone because this should not be happening to items straight out of the box.. 

$$;
Pros:. Loved the feature of watching Netflix, really liked the included wireless plug. Features and brand were the reasons I purchased the unit as well as the controls on the top of the DVD player.. 
Cons:. Wireless connection takes too long to establish, unit won't play older DVDs without freezing and no code for Oneforall universal remote.. 
Summary:. Purchased this one on sale at Best Buy at the recommendation of ratings on CNET and from the salesperson. I should have been weary when the firmware update took 25 minutes. Some newer disks freeze when played and all of my older DVDs froze consistently..

Pros:. Easy to use basic stuff such as the eject button, and play button.... oh and the power cord plugs into the wall real nice, No sparks or electrocution.. Setting up Netflix was super easy... on all 4 units. Easiest thing about this product. 
Cons:. 1. Firmware updating bricks it. Guaranteed. 2. Networking to a NAS or other computer is impossible. And yes, even for a networking superstar with the Samsung PC Share.. 3. Remote is sluggish in response time and get unexpected results. 
Summary:. I bricked 3 of them before realizing that the common thread was updating the firmware which nags you every time you turn it on. Would be nice to disable that, especially since the firmware bricks it. Luckily Best Buy has a hassle free return policy within 14 days. I truly believed in this product which is why I decided to keep it instead of just full money back.. 2. After setting this up for 3 times in a row, I knew the networking thing like the back of my hand, yet its impossible to get this to work properly. Sure I can connect to my NAS and computer folders, but for some reason it doesnt show anything in the folders. I gave up after countless hours.. Overall when I play a blue ray DVD it plays very well. I tried burning some content to a DVD one day and it wouldnt play. Ive done this a million times with my apex dvd player. I am utterly terrified to do an update. Maybe in a year or 2 after samsung actually figures out how to write firmware before releasing it to the public. I would advise you to not buy this product if you want a hassle free experience adopting a new piece of hardware such as this. I really only bought it because of the netflix streaming which thus far works great.. 2 Stars - One for the Netflix working, other becase it doesnt electrocute me or erase my brain when I use it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of features fot the price. I got this player for $75 less than the LG equivalent. When I got it the wireless worked great and the DVD player worked very well.. 
Cons:. Remote works occasionally. Press button and Samsung TV power flickers so I know the remote is working, but nothing happens on the Blue Ray unit. After upgrading firmware, I have had to reset the wireless connection twice. I should've purchased LG.. 
Summary:. Lots of features, very good price, poor quality. Everything Samsung I have purchased has been crap other than the picture. I usually purchase Sony and I guess I should have waited for Sony to come out with their own Netflix Blue Ray - wireless unit. I do not recommend anyone purchase this player. I have gone through 2 of them with the same results. At lease Samsung is consistent on one thing...quality is below average.. 

$$;
Pros:. Netflix Streaming (sometimes), Pandora streaming (less often), Video quality was sharp. 
Cons:. Where to start?...Couldn't hold connection, forgot connection credentials, frequently lost connection in the middle of streaming. That was on wired. Wireless was even worse.. 
Summary:. I didn't experience the huge reliability problems that others have complained about simply because I jumped ship early. Out of the box, everything worked as advertised. I got right on the network and started streaming with no problems. Every time after that was a different story. The network connection, wireless or wired, was hit and miss. If it DID connect, it took over 3 minutes to do so.. Netflix and Pandora streaming, though arguably the coolest things ever to be integrated into a DVD player, were ruined by the Samsung's slow button response times and annoying interface. Scrolling through my Netflix queue took paaaatttiieeeennccceeee. It was aggravatingly slow to do just about anything.. BR picture quality was sharp looking, but had a tinge of artificial to it that made film-based content look "thin" and took away the depth and luster of most content. Things seemed more 2 dimensional than on my Panasonic.. I really tried to give this thing a shot based on its possibilities. After 2 weeks, enough was enough. I can't recommend this player to anyone based on my experience and it sounds like the majority of you are the same boat.. If you have to have Netflix and Pandora, try the LG. If you can live without it, get an Oppo or Panasonic and be done with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well the picture is great, only if you buy real Blue-Ray DVDs, that was not the point. sorry to the Big Wigs @ Sony Pictures, I would have preferred the Mauve High Res DVDs over yours in the 1st place. 
Cons:. I bought the Samsung BD-P3600 after much debate , I wanted to suck down High RES movies from the INET , I have over 700 DVDs and do not want to buy every one over just to suit the Big Wigs @ Sony thank you very much. 
Summary:. - not ONCE have I connected to any of my 3 PCs 2x XP Operating SYs and 1X Vista I actually had to walk over to my spare (slave) PC to find out what that was called but that is another story - every time I try &#38; connect it says Wrong USERNAME / PASSWORD I have tried every user /pass in the book, short - complicated nothing works, I have 0 time to call teck support, I believe that when you spend $400 + $100 for stupid monster cables that everything should work right out of the box... am I crazy for thinking this??. 

$$;
Pros:. very good blu ray picture Wi Fi streaming great when set up ( if working ))netflix &#38; pandora.. 
Cons:. difficult wi fi set up.unstable connection .Cheesy construction.instructions for Op link set up (in owners manual) incorrect.Customer support not helpfull;slow &#38; non professional.. 
Summary:. I dislike the set up headaches with Wi Fi.Customer service sucks.Repeated E mails not answered.Was forced to resolve issues on my own.Was told my connectivity issue with the Optical connection would have to be resolved by the design engineer that never got back to me.The written instructions for this are wrong.Would have returned for another brand but was'nt possible. No more Samsung for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast load times, excellent feature set.. 
Cons:. The networking function of this device is hard to set up and apparently full of bugs. Google Samsung BD-3600 and "freeze" for more info.. 
Summary:. DO NOT attempt to setup wireless networking before updating the firmware (using the USB Flash Drive). I made this mistake, and had to return the machine--the firmware locks up when you power on and there doesn't seem to be any way restore factory defaults. Called the seller and Samsung got no-where. Instead I sent it back for the LG BD390. Works like a champ and setup was easy-peasy.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Excelent picture and sound quality. - Fast. - Netflix. - Pandora internet radio. - PC streaming (really?). 
Cons:. - Frequent lock ups. - Glitches even with subtitles (how can you screw up subtitles). - PC streaming is a joke. 
Summary:. I am going to focus my comments on the one "feature" that really pissed me off. That feature was the PC streaming. How can a company tout a feature that is basically unusable?. I eventually did get it to work, but only after many hours of tinkering and research on the web. Here is what I had to do to get it to work:. - Set up a new user account (non-administrator). - Create a new shared folder in the root directory. - Because the automatic setting did not work, I had to enter the information manually. That information included the IP address of my computer, the username and password of the new user account I just created and the name of the new folder that I created. By the way, that automatic setting that is supposed to find your shared folders will probably not work for you. Every post I read mentioned that they had to set up things manually (XP or Vista).. - Okay, so I went though all that and entered all the data with the remote. As you can guess, that took a while. On the screen, it prompts you to save at each step. One problem.....it doesn't actually save the information!. = After you turn off the player, that information is lost. Guess what...if you want to stream files agan, you have to enter the information all over again!. I just focused on the PC streaming issue, but that combined with the other glitches were just unacceptable. Funny thing is PC streaming was not a major factor in my purchase decision, but when I pay for a feature, I expect it to work.. I went ahead and returned the player and purchased the LG BD390. I was up and running in under 15 minutes. That includes the PC streaming feature! Not a single glitch.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is excellent. Set up is easy with wifi. Controls are easy to handle.. 
Cons:. Loading time is slow. Sometimes hangs on loading. Occasionally audio and video are out of sync.. 
Summary:. We gave it a thorough testing, but kept running into bugs. The first noticeable bug was the audio being behind the video. Restarting the machine seemed to help, but the bug would eventually return. With some discs, it would not load the movie at all. There was a noticeable click and whirring sound when this happened - suggesting to me that perhaps we just got a defective unit. However, there are quite a number of other posts indicating similar hardware issues. Makes me wonder if they manufactured a bad batch and rushed these units out. When it does work, the picture quality is excellent and the 7.1 audio output is excellent. Netflix was a bit buggy with noticeably slow loading times (we also have an xbox360 - granted it has a larger HDD, but netflix runs without any hitches and at lightning speed compared to this unit). Pandora worked great and the audio output was clear. We tested our setup with a Sony blu ray player which didn't have any problems playing any of our discs. I would just recommend that you give the unit a thorough testing to make sure that you didn't get a lemon. Ended up returning ours and are contemplating getting a sony ps3 instead.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks nice.. 
Cons:. Slow to start up, difficult to see remote and useless buttons on the player when your trying to select buttons in simi darkness of a home theater. Had to have a flashlight handy just to see the buttons.. 
Summary:. Slow and not user friendly. 

$$;
Pros:. Streams Netflix, Pandora and Youtube. Blockbuster was added after purchase, but they are now bankrupt and their streaming model is $$$ Expensive model in their series that has apps and supposedly upgradeable. 
Cons:. Recently Samsung has let this model drop from support in less than a year from purchase.. 30+ questions left unanswered on their owners forum/support site.. Firmware upgrades are buggy and sporadic.. New Blurays sometimes will not play.. 
Summary:. Buyer beware now and also those considering newer Sammy models with apps built in. This demonstrates a POOR support model for their products integrated with apps.. Buyers of 2010 models beware of being left in the dust on your models. You may want to consider Apple TV or Google TV with a cheaper Bluray model given Samsung's poor support of app integrated models. Buyer beware!. 

$$;
Pros:. Since it has never worked correctly, I have nothing positive to say.. 
Cons:. DVD's skip and the WI-FI streaming stutters and stops. It is now at Samsung's service for the second time. I am not hopeful.. 
Summary:. Do not purchase this unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Legacy connections, online streaming, BD Live support, wired, wireless, network connections, ability to see computer shares. 
Cons:. Shoddy workmanship, very slow load times and slow context switching, exceptionally poor labor warranty support, very expensive repairs, exceptionally poor repair work, very slow repair turnaround time, uneven, jumpy, or failed menu operation on disks. 
Summary:. I've had two of these units. The first one died during a firmware update. I regularly update firmware on network and computer devices as part of my job, so a BD player is not much of a challenge. There was no factory reset on this version of this model, so I couldn't reset the player. New versions appear to have a factory reset setting. As such, I had to replace the main board at my expense after owning the player just out of labor warranty at 90 days. The repair was expensive and the player came back running far worse than it went in. I returned it to the shop and told them to keep it. I ordered a second player with extended warranty from a different shop. I was hoping the first one was a lemon and the performance issues would go away. Alas, they haven't. The player is as describe above in my Cons section, quite slow, with jumpy menus on both the player side and the disk side. If you absolutely have to have streaming, network and legacy connection support, this is about the only player I found with them all. Otherwise, if all you need is a player, steer quite clear of this player. Consider it a high risk purchase if do buy it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good sound. Good picture.. 
Cons:. Networking is horrible. I constantly have to reboot. Menu system is very slow to respond to the remote. Can't stop DVD's from auto playing on startup.. 
Summary:. Garbage. I expected better from Samsung.. 

$$;
Pros:. The theory behind the player is great.. 
Cons:. The theory doesn't work consistently. 
Summary:. I have had the player for 8 months. I love the idea of PC streaming but the picture locks up and the player needs to be rebooted. Pause on PC streaming lasts less than 3 minutes and then the player needs to be FF to get to your spot. Too many Bluray titles lock up and player needs to be rebooted. Too often (not always) I have to suspend the firewall in the PC in order for the player to see shared folders. The player doesn?t see the entire network, only the PC that has been on the longest. Should Microsoft do a security update then the router must renew the client lease time before the player will find the shared PC. Samsung service is clueless. They insist that the player be sent in for service when the problem is firmware. Samsung has not addressed customer concerns with any kind of reassurance that the problems will be addressed. I wish that I had never purchased the player. I have a 61 and a 32 inch Samsung TV. One last item, I keep all of my theatre components in a built in wooden cabinet so that I don?t have to see a mosaic of blinking leds when I watch a video. This player is the only component that will not react to a remote IR blaster to control it. They force you to use the Anynet feature but that doesn?t utilize all the controls on the remote. I was going to buy a Samsung Camera but decided to go with another brand because of the service problems on this player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to hook up dvd player; good picture. 
Cons:. It's taken 3 days and still not able to connect wirelessly. It's a Gateway Ping issue, heard if router is more than 10 ft away it won't work. Wow, that's NOT helpful as ours is in another room. Should have read CNets customer reviews before buying.. 
Summary:. Too hard to hook up in this technological age. Returning player for Play Station 3, which does everything this does Plus play games. We hope Samsung reads these reviews.. 

$$;
Pros:. I loved the Pandora integration and found the wireless easy to set up. It made my standard DVDs look better on my 50 inch plasma television.. 
Cons:. Too buggy. It would often freeze up when switching from disc to online or while using Netflix. It didn't handle the Netflix online very well either (constantly freezing and buffering).. 
Summary:. I liked the concept, but it was just too buggy. I took it back and got the LG and have been very satisfied (except no Pandora :( ). 

$$;
Pros:. The picture,sound and upscaling were excellent. 
Cons:. 1. The display could not be read easily, even sitting 3' back.. 2. The remote was odd, and not intuitive. This all led to frustration.. 
Summary:. The manual control functions on the top of the unit were easily activated. While connecting (setting up), the disc door was accidently activated while I was moving unit into position and I could have easily broken drive. I returned and exchaned for LG BD390. 

$$;
Pros:. Good remote. The netlix and pandora features work well and are easy to use. 
Cons:. The unit freezes a lot, the auto resume doesn't work as well as on other units. The cheaper model without the built in wifi is probably a better deal too. Overall, not convinced that blue ray is worth the expense. Going Roku.. 
Summary:. Skip Bluray and go Roku. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays blu-ray ok (but see problems), has Pandora music support. 
Cons:. Playback pauses (at least playing Watchman blu-ray disk).. Can't do anything but play disk if disk is in player; can't use internet features.. Produces garbage video through component video out until 480i set; you have to do this via composite video.. 
Summary:. The user interface of this player is not well thought out. I am using the player with a conventional TV; it's very difficult to get the 480i video set, and even after setting it, it seems to lose the setting have being turned off (but not unplugged). It also seems to "forget" the display setting when going to internet features (such as utube).. It also is a one-trick pony; when a blu-ray disk is inserted, it won't do anything but play it; even if you have the disk stopped, you can't get to the internet features. If you open the door to defeat it, it won't do anything else until the door is closed.. I've only played one blu-ray disk on it; 'Watchman'. Periodically (perhaps at chapter boundaries) the video would momentarily freeze, and the sound would stop for a bit longer before continuing. This seems pretty lame for a $300 player.. I'm going to return the damn thing, but it's not clear what's better. CNET loves everything, no matter how crappy, so it's tough to get a real review, warts and all.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good video picture. 
Cons:. Problems with bios and IR blaster.. 
Summary:. The unit worked fine until it did a bios update. After that the tray would not open. Samsung tech support was no help. Ended up sending it to the NJ factory to be repaired. No DVD player for 10 days. Oh yah the manual shows the location of the IR. blaster sensor but guess what ... that is NOT where it is located. Not even close!. 

$$;
Pros:. I did like it at first. 
Cons:. very bad cust service. 
Summary:. firmware update, system would not reconnect to my wireless system, cust service advice send it to va, this after several calls then got shipping label to another UPS sta, they did not know what to do with it, so called back and had a new shipping label sent,the player was serviced(?) and returned indicating that there was nothing wrong with the unit(?). I then l had to have the Geek Squad come to my house and my expense to repair this thing which they did after about two hours at my house. Samsung needs to do something about this as after some research I find this is a common problem with their customer service and this BD 3600 player. 

$$;
Pros:. Pandora and Netflix are cool, when they work.. 
Cons:. 2 out of 3 functions failed on 3 different blu-ray players! Had to replace 4 times. Samsung aware of the Netflix problem. Have not watched disk because the open/close has now failed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Netflix connectivity is nice. Comes with Wireless dongle. Plays burned and complied DVD's nicely.. 
Cons:. Blue Ray disks will often hang during playback and jump several chapters back. Video and Audio are out of sync in streaming playback, and even if it starts out fine, often the system will hang for several minutes before coming back with errors.. 
Summary:. All in all, I understand why Cnet gave it a good rating. The individule features are nice, and the fact that it comes with the wireless dongle is a big plus. But shame on Cnet for not doing a bit more testing before giving it the thumbs up. This unit is very buggy and for the price and waste of time. I love Samsung products, but this unit felt like a much lesser quality unit not deserving the Samnsung name.. Stay far away.. Updated. on Aug 4, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Great device. Lots of features. Relatively Easy Wi-Fi Setup. Great look and options.. 
Cons:. The thing froze up 2 times. Once with the firmware Update and once without.. 
Summary:. If it wasnt for the Unrepairable lockup on the unit it would have been a great first Blueray player. 

$$;
Pros:. Played movies beautifully. Netflix was a very nice feature and worked flawlessly.. 
Cons:. Notice the past tense. After about 6 months it would lock up from time to time and unplugging/replugging would correct the issue. Two days ago it broke and will not work. Didn't even get 11 months out of it.. 
Summary:. Samsung claims that the NEW warranty on this unit is only 12 months for parts, and 3 months for labor, even though my receipt specifically states "12 month warranty". They want me to ship the unit to them along with $110 for them to even touch it. Keep in mind, this NEW unit is not even 11 months old!. All I was doing was watching a movie from a USB thumb drive (which was working beautifully) and I hit the rewind button. The unit froze and after trying everything I had to unplug it. After plugging it back in, LOAD is stuck on the screen and it won't do anything else.. I'm sure something with the flash memory got corrupted somehow, and I am HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED that they want me to PAY them to fix this unit that failed after not eleven 11 months of very light usage.. 

$$;
Pros:. None that I can think of.. 
Cons:. Too many to list.. 
Summary:. This unit is great when it works. The problem is I have to unplug it every time I want to use it. Not too convenient. When we first got it the unit was fantastic. It quickly stopped working correctly and now it is more of a headache than it is worth. Warranty is out now and I am stuck with it. I have done updates both through the net and through a thumb drive. It is so problematic that I want to smash it. When the Netflix streaming works I really enjoy the unit. There has to be something better out there than this. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Sound and picture quality are above average.. 
Cons:. Wireless set up was difficult. Streaming never worked well despite multiple support calls to Samsung. Samsung support is poor. Unit runs hot.. 
Summary:. Cons tell it all. Had really hard time with the wireless setup. The interface is dark ages, having to scroll through and input every data piece and the scrolling is very slow. Multiple driver updates required out of box. The Netflix streaming has been a disaster, about every 15 min. the steam will blink out and the setup has to be refreshed. I made several calls to Samsung and they were of minimal help, they would not replace the unit either. AVOID THIS UNIT, UNLESS YOU LIKE RED TAPE AND HASSLES.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture when it worked.. 
Cons:. Load drawer locks, DVD's freeze, Netflix freezes, unit shuts off after it freezes, customer service was no help. 
Summary:. I am very disappointed with this product. Within a couple of months I began experiencing the following problems: Load drawer locks up, DVD's freeze during play, Netflix shows freeze, TV screen scrambles and turns green, then unit shuts off. Now I have to pay $50 to have the unit repaired by Samsung Service without a guarantee that this product will work when returned. This was my first Samsung product - I am not anxious to buy any of their other products.. Updated. on Aug 3, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Not sure what I like about this product.. 
Cons:. The user interface is abysmall. The remove control is cheap and badly functioning.. The firmware is polling based and makes the unit unresponsive 99% of the times. Playback locks up sometimes and the only way to get out of it is power cycle.. 
Summary:. I bought this unit at Christmas time, 2009 at Best Buy. There was a whole stack of those units resting on a pallet in the middle of the isle at Best Buy.. The user interface is unintuitive, slow, sluggish. The font size is too small. The font they've chosen is horrible. The colors are completely abysmal. It is very hard to read what is on the screen. The organization is completely horrible and unintuitive.. The remote control is so, so cheap, it's not even funny. The plastic used is cheap, the buttons are very shallow and too soft, no tactile feedback whatsoever. The remote control has a very short operating range and has to be pointed EXACTLY at the unit in order to operate, i.e. if the coffee table is in the way, it will NOT work. While all my other remote controls do operate in the same setting. Chances are you have one other remote, and the difference is abysmal.. Playback: Playing a DVD or BD, it would freeze, at random, and show a black screen. Eventually the only way to get it back into operational mode is power cycling the unit. Pressing the "Return", "Exit", "Info", "Menu" buttons on the remote control all show the No-entrance street sign in the top right corner of the unit and nothing happens. This goes on for a long while then eventually you may get a menu screen or not. But while you're waiting, you cannot press ANYTHING that will get any response from the unit. While playing DVD/BD the only button that works is the "Eject" button.. Streaming Netflix works, but every other movie it would freeze, at or before the 10th minute into the movie, then nothing you can press will get any response from the unit, then after a long wait, 2 minutes, it tells you that the internet connection is bad, and then you'll have to power cycle the unit. After which, you can play other streaming media, i.e. Pandora, just fine, so it wasn't your Wireless Access Point. If you have any other wireless device, you can verify that it is the unit and not your WAP.. Playing DVD/BD: it would freeze in the beginning locking you out of skipping the MPAA and other organizations' threats. You literally have to wait for about 2 minutes for those to play out before you can press any buttons (other than the "Eject" button as noted above). Then 8/10 times it would lock you out of pressing any buttons while watching the previews of other films. I often would power cycle the unit, on order to be able to skip those, as it is faster to power cycle the unit rather than wait for the previews to play out while the user interface is locked out.. Press the On/Off button on the remote and "OFF" would appear in the LED screen in the unit, but the unit will be ON and a picture would show for about 5 seconds. Then after 5 seconds, the power would actually go off. This seems to be a permanent feature.. Similarly for all functions, the unit is extremely sluggish.. The shape of the unit is just like a brownies pan. Something you can clearly see in the pictures below. The unit is non-stackable, which means that it will either have to be at the top or occupy more horizontal space.. Most of the shortcomings of this unit can be resolved by a firmware overhaul. Make the firmware interrupt driven, instead of polling driven. Make every function of the unit interruptible.. According to the unit's menu, at the time of writing this reivew (April 25, 2010) it has the latest FW.. This is a cheap, cheap, unit. It should be priced at $50-$75 USD, and it is clearly overpriced.. Do not waste your money on this unit. I know I did.. 

$$;
Pros:. Didn't take up much room in the garbage can.. 
Cons:. Only worked when it wanted to. Hours and hours on the phone with Samsung. Nothing resolved.. 
Summary:. Possibly The worse purchase I have ever made. Will never buy a Samsung ever. Would have been less frustrating to have just burned my 300.00 dollars.. 

$$;
Pros:. the unit goes thru fits and jerks before it finally stumbles to where you can access the disc. 
Cons:. stops and starts,refuses to play some brand new discs;will not play some dvds that an old $40.00 dvd player will play.. 
Summary:. slow to engage the disc..stops and starts skips takes fits. 

$$;
Pros:. Ran well when it was working. Especially liked the Netflix connection.. 
Cons:. Died just under 90 days after purchase. Need to spend $15 to ship it for repair. Unit will not turn on, but I needed to answer a dozen irrelevant questions and force through another dozen FAQs on the Samsung web site just to register the issue.. 
Summary:. Unimpressed with something that can work for a few years, never mind 90 days. Worse, Samsung must know this b/c they only warranty the labor for 90 days (parts for a year).. Their web site is bloated and full of useless overhead that makes dealing with them painful. Wonder if this is on purpose to cause some folks to just give up. If you don't walk through their FAQs but return your broken product anyway, you may be charged $55. I don't mind FAQs but if the unit doesn't power on their FAQs are not going to help and there should be a logical shortcut around them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks good. 
Cons:. Doesn't work. 
Summary:. Bought a refurbished unit. Placed a regular DVD in the unit and it worked fine. Inserted a Blu Ray disc and it said it can not play the disc. Called Samsung customer service and they said I didn't need to update the firmware, rather, I needed to try another Blu Ray Disc, which I didn't have. So, I updated the firmware anyway and it worked. Two hours later I tried to play the same Blu Ray disc and the machine says it can't play the disc-again. Called Samsung's customer service back and they said they need to send out someone to service the machine. No thanks. I am sending it back for a refund. Believe the negative reviews about this machine. Don't waste your time or money.. Updated. on Mar 7, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up. Great wifi. small footprint. 
Cons:. Locks up often. Regular DVDs don't look as good on this as my PS 3. 
Summary:. It only took me a couple of minutes to hook this up and connect it to my home network. I subscribe to netflix and it works great - even with HD movies. However, after about 2 months I noticed that the machine locks up for no reason. I have to go completely out of netflix and restart to get the movie going again. Then it works for about 7-9 minutes and locks up again. I've also noticed that it is starting to do the same thing with movies. It is really frustrating that it freezes right in the middle of a movie and I have to eject and start all over - thank god for chapters. My regular movies don't look as good as they do on my PS3. I am not happy with this DVD player. I wouldn't recommend this player because it doesn't seem worth the money. I do keep the player firmware updated, but that sure doesn't work.. 

$$;
Pros:. No pros for this player.. 
Cons:. Do not buy this. It will come back to bite you.. 
Summary:. After having the player for 3.5 months and doing two firmware updates successfully, something firmware related caused the player to fail. The display continually reads LOAD DISC or CLOSE DOOR even when a disc is loaded. Do not buy this player. It is completely unreliable. Even if the features and price seem good - you will regret the purchase as I do. Samsung indicated we could ship it back to them, but we would be responsible for labor charges (parts are covered for 1 year, labor only 3 months). They would not provide a quote on what it would cost though. This is ridiculous for a 3.5 month old piece of electronics. It is such a common problem they even have this as a known troubleshooting issue in the manual. As someone who owns a software company, this type of known software problem is unacceptable.. 

$$;
Pros:. None. The only reason I bought it was to stream NetFlix.. 
Cons:. Wireless interface is poorly designed. This interface was the only reason I bought the player.. 
Summary:. I have been unable to get the wireless interface to work with this device. After multiple calls to Sansumg support their best approach is to turn off all firewalls in my router. This was after a number of ?suggestions? like: a) it won?t work if the device and the router are not in the same room, b) you have to specifically set which wireless channel is used. Before I called support I had already gone through an renamed my network so that the name contained only letters (no spaces, special characters?.). After my initial problems I did some searching to see if others were having the same problem. Yes, there are lots of posts about the wireless issues. Some people seem to get it working through a set of random changes, not all of which match. I find it very hard to believe that anyone could sell a device that operates as poorly as this one does.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays Blu-Ray disks OK.. 
Cons:. When streaming Netflix movies the unit will occasionally emit a loud beep. (So loud it will blow your speakers out.) Samsung customer service is not helpful.. 
Summary:. When streaming Netflix movies the unit will occasionally emit a loud beep. (So loud it will blow your speakers out.) Samsung customer service is not helpful. They hire a company in India to deflect all customer service inquiries. They have no technical knowledge about the products nor any authority to resolve problems. Just excuses and circular arguements.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works, it is fine. Nice picture and sound, as one would expect.. 
Cons:. Most of time it doesn't work properly. I have to power cycle this unit like some temperamental PC. Most of the time, it gets hung up and stops working. I have a service call in on it. We'll see if it gets fixed or they replace.. 
Summary:. I hate this unit because it works properly less than 25% of the time..

Cons:. croacked 3 times so far. 
Summary:. Lucky for me I bought the extended service contract, but I shouldn't need to. I've had use of it for only 3 months out of the 7 I've owned it.. There's a problem called "bricking" when the unit fails to correctly update the firmware. I also had a problem with "freezing" which Samsung insisted can be fixed with a firmware update. WRONG. Updating the firmware created another "bricking" problem. It's back at the service center for the 2nd time, after not being fixed the 1st time.. It's on it's 3rd failure, and this time it'll go back to Fred Meyer if it fails again. There may be alot of noise when it happens.. If you have such a unit, return it immediately to the store with copies of these reviews, and ask them for an alternative. Samsung is very aware of the problem because they've extended the warranty. Too bad it's not a safety issue, because they would be recalling them. Ralph Nadar, where are you?. Updated. on Jan 13, 2010.

Pros:. Good appearance, easy interface. 
Cons:. Typical Netflix problem...freezes after one movie. Thought it was a wireless network issue, so I installed a Powerline network so it would be hardwired. No difference...Netflix still froze after 1 movie. Returned it today..
