good stuff : they really accommodated us in switching rooms - we had std room but it was right by the contruction and we wanted to sleep in after have 2 days of up early and at parks all days !
came back and clerk got us a room but right by elevators so 2nd attempt she upgraded us to pool view and for all the hassle gave us free meal vouchers !
bonus !
i love the colors and decor - so retro - just a fun atmosphere .
the pools are great - and once you figure out how to get back n forth not a big deal but it is not easy and not well marked .
one pool has lazy river and fun dj to hang with - my son won a hoola hoop contest and had a great time !
the other pool had a slide and seemed to have more kids .
nice to have snack bar and lounge at both pools - plenty of chairs and pool towels .
big dining area with 4 choices - nice to have but food marginal and prices are rather steep - but , better than the pool bar . . .
bathrooms - huge - a lot of dead space though - not utilized or neededbad : tiny rooms - probably the smallest i have stayed in and at $ 200 a night !
wdw budget rooms are more economical - not sure on their size though !
bowling is crazy expensive - would have been $ 50 for an hour for us three ! ?
what ?
no bathroom fans ?
no mirror in room other than bathroom and it is all steamed up because of the fan issue ! !
huge long hallways = very noisy nights - we had bags and towels up against bottom of door - kids yelling up past 1 am in the halls . . . .
: ( construction - make sure to stay away from that area - very noisy right now building the towers .
huge hotel already and now adding two towers - gon na be a mad house .
parks - long walk - they make you walk way out of your way to cross the street to walk on the garden walk to the parks . . . .
better planning was needed .
shuttles to seaworld need to be made the day before and reserved . . .
not a friendly rep there handling that .
