$$;
Pros:. the small size is great, though its on screen keyboard is cramped speed of the phone is well worth it. Though its processor is decent the phones speed is faster than any other android phone i have seen, and the battery life is ....decent. 
Cons:. the battery life is decent but managable and well worth it for the phone, no third party apps meh not that big of a deal, lack of flash and cramped keys are annoying. 
Summary:. GREAT, easily best android phone on at&#38;t and its weaknesses are easily overpowered by its strengths, also very goodd starter phone. (-:. 

$$;
Pros:. Some of the HTC widgets are REALLY handy. Nice form factor and well made.. 
Cons:. Battery takes an AGE to recharge.. Android Market still not as good as iTunes App Store.. 
Summary:. I have the overseas, non at&#38;t version, so i have sideloading. The messages widget, battery widget and settings widgets from HTC are incredibly handy (as well as the calendar and notes widgets, which are all free). So far the Android market place has been a slight let down, but I have all the news apps I need, as well as angry birds. Hopefully it gets better, quickly.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, apps, cost, usable. 
Cons:. none at this point. 
Summary:. It is just what I want in a smart phone not a power user.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great operating system, user interface, battery life has been great for me, very responsive touch screen, voice to text works great, display looks great.. 
Cons:. Speaker phone could be a bit louder but other than that everything else is perfect.. 
Summary:. I recently owned an iPhone 3gs and my friend got the aria a few weeks later. I tried it out then fell in love. One of my favorite things is that I can get a free music app off the android market so that beats itunes. The camera takes better pictures than a cell phone has any right too. Im even using it to wrote this review. Get this phone if youre choosing between this or an iPhone. Android is too great to pass up.. 

$$;
Pros:. You can customize the view &#38; shortcuts to your personal preference making it fit your life style. The ability to create multiple scenes is condusive to our ever changing preferences of the daily "on the go". The slim &#38; sleek design is easy to hold. 
Cons:. The keyboard is a little cramped, but the typing software makes up for this, enabling you to still type accurately &#38; it gets smarter the longer you use it, making your phone all the more personalized.. 
Summary:. If you are in the market for a new phone that does EVERYTHING and isn't a freakin brick.... THIS is the phone to get!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Its small enough to carry around easily but not too small to use. The internet and apps load quickly. Decent battery life. Simple to use.. 
Cons:. No flash on the camera, you have to download HTC Sync to install third party apps, the onscreen keyboard is somewhat difficult to use when vertical. 
Summary:. The HTC Aria is an awesome phone for just about anyone. Its packed with features and has a relatively low price tag. And it is possible to install third party apps and games from a computer, you just need the software from HTC's website.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size and feel are great. If you have the right version of HTC Sync, you can sideload apps. Processor specs may not sound great, but phone is pretty quick.. 
Cons:. Battery life.. 
Summary:. Has all the features I want in an Android phone, without the ridiculous size of some of the higher end models. I live in a house of iPhones, and they are jealous.. 

$$;
Pros:. every thing. 
Cons:. nothing........ 

$$;
Pros:. Near perfection. Fast, small, high quality. Bought mine off contract, works great. SIPdroid + Gizmo + WiFi = holy grail, and yes it works. HTC sense takes it over the finish line with a beautiful, polished and fast UI.. 
Cons:. The small size makes touchscreen activities a little clumsy, but not bad. AT&#38;T plays the strict parent role for this handset, limiting some fun we might otherwise have - tethering, sideloading, etc.. 
Summary:. The phone can't be beat. It's phenomenal. I am disappointed at quality of offline GPS apps available, but that is hardly a phone issue. If you are waiting for a usable, svelte android phone which feels more like a phone than a nerd device (nothing against nerd devices... !) then your wait is over.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone does a great job at keeping all my social networking, and email sync'd and up to date. thr touch screen is quick. 
Cons:. it would be nice to get a little more battery life per charge. 
Summary:. hands down, this phone is the most fun ive ever had with a phone. It's eazy to use and has plenty of free apps to keep you busy. There are 7 home screens that give you plenty of room for all your fav. apps, and widgets.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love this phone! Email push, app market, video picuture quality is awesome. This a great phone for first time Android users!. 
Cons:. Small keyboard, however i knew that when I bought it. I have big fingers!. 
Summary:. I strongly recomend this phone and extremely happy with the purchase. Even thought ATT has blocked 3rd party apps, there are over 500,000 in the App Market. I am pretty sure you won't suffer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Camera, size, everything. 
Cons:. can't think of any. 
Summary:. This is my first Android phone and I absolutely LOVE it! The more I get familiar with this phone the more I love it. The camera is just absolutely stunning I feel its just as good as my 12mp digital camera. I have FINALLY found the phone that I won't be in hurry to get rid of. LOVE IT.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone is absolutley GREAT!!!! Ive always wanted a droid powered phone, but since i was with ATT instead of Verizon there was no way. I'm loyal customer to ATT and am not willing to change. This phone can runs the internet excellent, EVERYTHING!. 
Cons:. The only con i see is that you have to get usto the touchscreen keypad, but after a day or two, the phone is just loveable, also the battery life is ok, but thats what you should expect from any top end phone. 
Summary:. This phone is really incredible, they should have name this the Htc Incredible, but i love this phone and would reccomend it to any ATT memeber thinking of switching to Verizon just to get a droid phone. This phone rivals any droid phone for verizon, i know, i do my research ":). 

$$;
Pros:. Compact. Smooth. More power than you?d ever need. 
Cons:. Battery life does not last two days. Lowish speaker volume. 
Summary:. I have an iphone 3G and contemplated upgrade to iphone4 and decided with go with this "freebe" via Amazon. SO glad we did that. Small, light, portable, no case needed with the rubberized back, and extremely pocketable. No need to baby this thing and wrap around some $30 case. Beautiful screen, and tons of apps! Filled up my 7 home screens in two days. I now have about 30 apps. Google Voice Search and Navigation are particularly amazing. Runs multiple apps at the same time. Love it that I can talk and read emails and look up, type memos at the same time. This phone does everything for me, and just about runs my life. Battery life is not bad at all if you have Y5 installed. Speaker volume is a little low, no worse than the iphone, and not a surprise with such a compact phone.. To those who complain about not being able to install off market apps. Most of these apps are beta's. Swype is no longer "off market". I downloaded HTC Sync to have the ability to do it, but cannot actually find an off market app I want to install.. 

$$;
Pros:. Auto-correct typing is great, nearly flawless.. For the small phone the battery life is quite good.. Incredibly easy to set up. All android apps available and the phone is very quick. Great for anyone who doesn't mind the small screen with same usability. 
Cons:. No complaints on any front.. 
Summary:. I was skeptical at first about the virtual keyboard since this is my first smartphone. I was ok with it since you can turn it sideways but even just after owning it a week I never turn it sideways and always type with the vertical smaller keyboard. The auto-correct is surprisingly accurate. I love the fact that it populates your contacts with facebook, I anticipated a long evening of transferring phone numbers from my previous phone, I only had to add a few people who don't have facebook. It is also easily tethered with a laptop if you don't have wifi available. No complaints, great compact phone, A T and T hit home with this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. I just love this phone. Google turn-by-turn navigation is free and it's great. The notifications (email, vm, text, etc..) are awesome. You can get a warranty on this phone, which you can't with an iPhone.. 
Cons:. No visual voicemail like on iPhone (no big deal). Speakerphone not as loud as iPhone's.. 
Summary:. I switched to Aria from iPhone 3Gs, and after one week I can say the choice was a wise one. Same functionality, much better form factor. Didn't want the 4g, as it's practically the same phone no matter what the hype is - "it changes NOTHING at all".. Regarding some of the others' concerns... Battery life is great, better than the iPhone, if you're willing to do a bit of housekeeping. Get the "Advanced Task Killer", and after the phone had booted up, kill all the at&#38;t crapware that would usually sit in the background and drain your battery. If you're not using WiFi/Bluetooth/GPS, just disable when not needed. I use the phone extensively with no battery life problems whatsoever.. Regarding sideloading of the non-market apps.... you can root the device, and do whatever you want.... 

$$;
Pros:. This phone has been nothing short of magnificent. Everything works flawlessly. Extremely light and compact.. 
Cons:. There really aren't that many shortcomings. Keyboard can be difficult sometimes as occasionally but not often I hit the period button or shift key but I do not mind as it only happens like one out of every 50 texts.. 
Summary:. I got this phone the other day and it has been amazing. Everything is pretty sweet. The sound quality of the music rivals that of my computer speakers(seriously). Can multitask quite easily(unlike Apple who waited til 4th generation to understand). Android OS plus the HTC model equals a fantastic phone. I did not think ATT was capable of putting a real phone out there but it proved me wrong. Compared to my old fuze this phone is a dream come true. I highly suggest this phone if you do not want an iphone or wish to have an android phone on ATT.. Updated. on Aug 6, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Pocket-sized full function Android phone. Screen is bright and crisp. Processor is snappy as can be. Trackpad rocks for fine cursor movement in text. Sense UI. Insanely fine control of 5MP camera.. 
Cons:. No LED flash, but neither do iPhones &lt; 4.. 
Summary:. Pretty much everything about this phone rocks. Compact size is great for pockets, while 3.2in screen is big enough for anything I'd want it for. Fits nicely in my hand and can get everywhere on the screen with my thumb. Only MINOR drawback is no LED flash, but no iPhones had them until this week, so.... I angsted for weeks and was finally ready to buy a TMo N1 off craigslist or ebay and rock their 6Mb HSPA+ network. Then that exact same weekend, out of the blue, ATT announces this phone. I checked it out on launch day and was seriously impressed. Angsted over it for one night, then read about wirefly.com's totally free offer and - booyah - saved $500 and got a badass android phone with SenseUI.. Not sure the 3rd party lock is completely accurate. HTC's User Manual with ATT branding all over it specifically describes loading 3rd party apps via HTC Sync over USB. So no to OTA 3rd parties, but probably yes to USB 3rd party apps.. For handheld gaming, I'll be getting an iPod touch with savings from paying $0 for the phone.. Updated. on Jun 27, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, speed, Sense UI. 
Cons:. Cramped touchscreen keyboard, limited upward mobility. 
Summary:. Great small phone if you want a phone with PDA functions rather than the other way around. The stock keyboard and ALL variants I have tried are tight and close to useless. However, you can sideload Swype and that makes it all good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Attractive, Light-Weight, Small, Screen Quality, Auto-Correct on Texts, Web Browser, Intuitiveness, Screen Doesn't Scratch, Speaker Quality, Free Apps are of High Quality. 
Cons:. Heavy Screen Glare, Texting Screen is cramped, Battery Life Sucks, My 3.2mp Blackberry Camera took better pictures than this 5mp (lacks autofocus), No Flash, Phone vibrates when ear is touching buttons on phone, Weather doesn't do small towns. 
Summary:. I have previously owned 2 Blackberry Pearls, 1 Pearl Flip, 1 8900 Javelin, and 1 9700 Bold. There was also an iPhone somewhere in that mix that I returned within hours to get another Blackberry. I switched to the Aria because I needed a change in my life, and my 9700 Bold had a bad web-browser. On the first day of ownership, I switched back to my 9700 six times because the Blackberry had features I missed.. That all changed once I found the app store, and came to realization that this device is not supposed to be like my Blackberry. Now, after 2 Weeks of ownership, I have grown to love this phone for it's fast loading speeds, and the amount of convenience at my fingertips. The texting takes some acclimating, but it really isn't that bad. However, I wish I could say the same about the battery life. The battery lasts on a good day up to 18 hours. This doesn't even rival my Blackberry's battery that lasted up to 7 days.. Overall, I do see myself going back to a Blackberry once they solve there internet browser issues, and email reformatting issues. However, this is a great phone to have for the time being.. And, I was wrong - Android is a great operating system.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Feel, FM Radio ++++, O.S., Speaking for the keyboard, app store, HTC Sense, Friend Stream, Mail Widget, Headphone Jack, Multi Touch Screen, very responsive. 
Cons:. No 3rd Party Apps, no flash on camera, Now swipe, Battery could be better. 
Summary:. I recommend this phone to anyone who wants a smartphone without all the hassle and it is an overall GREAT PHONE. 

$$;
Pros:. I love this phone!. 
Cons:. I have no cons. 
Summary:. My new unlocked phones is the best. Without it I would be lost. My HTC Aria is amazing. Being an unlocked at&#38;t phones I can take it overseas and my kids absolutely love the touchscreen, apps, and games. I'm definitely surprising my wife with one for her birthday. I got my htc unlock codes from unlockthatphone.com, they are amazing and fast to get cell phone unlock�codes. If you ever need any at&#38;t unlock codes be sure to check them out.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small phone fits well in had and pocket. Runs applications quickly. 
Cons:. It's not a 54" 1080i TV. 
Summary:. I bought the Aria just a month ago, coming from an iphone 3g. The Aria is a much snappier phone than the 3g, although even the middle-of-road Aria sports a much faster processor than the 3g. Call quality is fine, at least as good or better than y previous iphone 3g. I like the smaller Aria for its pocket-ability, the smaller screen is no real loss. I would like a front-facing camera, but that is still rare among Android phones. The main app I use is epocrates, and it runs terrificly on the Aria. I have no complaints and highly recommend the phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great functionality and intuitive - so easy to figure out. Smaller than an iPhone but has everything I need.. 
Cons:. Not sure it's the product's fault, but when they transferred my phonebook, only one number was transferred - not good at all. This may be an AT&#38;T problem. Best to have them print out your phone numbers before they transfer.. 
Summary:. Great - I highly recommend.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything, the size, the camera, the UI, the screen, haven't any flaws yet, speaker sounds great call quality is awesome. 
Cons:. None- everything has exceeded my expectations. 
Summary:. This phone is great anyone who rated under 3 stars your obviously not looking for a phone that does it all b/c this phone has and does it all! I am a business man which means I always need my emails and phone calls does all of that and more, it automatically sets my agenda up in my calendar so im always on task and i get calendar alerts. If your worried about the size if you have big hands DON'T BE! I have huge hands I palm basketballs very easily and texting has never been a problem for me. Did I mention I have this phone unlocked to use for my T-Mobile service it's awesome T-Mo needs a phone just like it in line-up asap!. 

$$;
Pros:. Durable, ease of use, operating system, build quality, size, quick processor, great looks, customizable. 
Cons:. *The battery can run short but not nearly as bad as some make it out to be.. *small bug with keyboard but rarely happens.. *. 
Summary:. "Had the phone for over a week now. All I can say is I am very happy with my purchase. Been waiting for a while now for an Android phone on ATT. Looked at the Captivate but much prefer the Sense UI from HTC over Samsung's Touchwiz. A few key points:. *Processor - Although not a 1gz processor the Aria has shown no lag whatsoever even when as many as 15 programs running. Very impressed.. *Physical size/build quality - The phone is built really well and feels solid in your hand even though it is quite small.. *Screen size - Okay not the 4+ inch display like many phones but it is plenty big for most uses. Some websites don't shrink to fit the width but that is a minor issue.. *Camera - No flash is disappointing but it takes pretty good pictures. There are different light settings which helps a bit. Haven't taken any video yet.. *Battery - The battery isn't nearly the issue many make it out to be. Is it great? No. Is it on par with many of the phones being made today? Yes. I can get through the day with a good amount of use. Just get the Advanced App Killer and you will be fine. I have mine set to kill apps after 30 mins.. *Keyboard - The portrait keyboard is small but the predictive text is VERY good. I have large fingers and in 2 days I have only sent a couple of texts (out of over 400) with mispelled words. Landscape keyboard is pretty good and the voice to text works really well. Every now and again (probably 6 times of 1500+ texts) the keyboard freezes and forces you to close. You can still send message though. Seems a small bug with predictive text. Simply close and re-open messaging and all is good again.. *Speaker volume - Another complaint by many that I have had no issue with. It is a bit tinny but it is plenty loud! You can adjust the phone ringer volume as well as media volume. Adjusting the media volume helped quite a bit when playing a song as a ring tone.. *Email - I have my work and 3 personal emails synced to the phone. Not an issue to speak of.. *Syncing Facebook - Not able to get my Facebook contacts to Sync with the phone. Really just wanted it because an easy way to get pix added to contacts. This is really the only issue with the phone I have had.. Again, overall I am very happy with this purchase. Many will say it can't compete with the higher end phones coming out but I think it definitely holds its own. If you are looking for an Android phone and don't have to follow the masses this is a great choice!". 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome user interface extreme amount of apps and rich display extremely responsive and quick If I was aware of it i would think it had the snap dragon processor in it already but i doesn't from what I read. Great midrange phone, a nice alternative.. 
Cons:. The false news about not being able to sideload apps. I have been able to sideload apps from day one and I didn't have to "root" my phone which i would ill advise you doing to your phone, it will ruin it for good.. 
Summary:. The phone runs on Android 2.1 after speaking to an HTC rep they have almost completed testing on Android 2.2 for the Aria and look to have released early fall. As far as im concerned the phone doesn't even need it, it's great the way it is! But the 2.2 will allow you to store apps on the sd card which means the phone will give the iphone a run for it's money. HTC blew apple out of the water years ago as far as im concerned.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pocketable. Loaded with features. Very responsive and fluid interface. Easy to connect to computer. Slim and elegant design. 
Cons:. Short battery life. keyboard in portrait mode can be a little cramped. can't side load some incredible apps. 
Summary:. The HTC Aria is a wonderful smartphone. It is literally the perfect size, making the iPhones, Blackberries, and Droids of the world seem huge by comparison. Although the specs may not be that impressive, the real life performance is not. It rarely stutters, and if it does its usually the network. I bought it recently and have had a few days to put it through its paces. The battery life is probably the only thing holding it back from being the perfect phone. It can barely get through a day. A day being 10am to 2am. The battery goes completely flat, and that is with good power management.. The HTC sense offers a lot of wonderful widgets, a great keyboard, especially in the landscape mode, the 7 screens, and a variety of other small things that smarten up the interface. I will say that you should immediately get a new music player, I recommend doubletwist, and advanced task killer. Since Android lacks a default simple and user friendly programs for both.. I would recommend getting this phone. So far its the best phone I've had, having switched from a Blackberry Curve 8310, and to that from the Sony Ericsson W760a. Its stylish, elegant, portable, fast, and ultimately useful. If you hate Apple and are on AT&#38;T, spring for this over the Captivate and any of the other smartphones. It has all the right ingredients, minus the battery issue, but thats common for a lot of smartphones. Now to wait for the Froyo update.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good performance in a a phone that fits easily in your pocket. It does everything I need it to. It seems quite fast despite it's mid-level specs. Great still photos and decent video. This does not feel like a mid-level phone.. 
Cons:. Small keyboard but that is to be expected with such a small phone. After 2-3 days I stopped noticing it. I do not have very big hands though.. 
Summary:. This is my first Android phone and after doing a lot of research I noticed that it never gets a bad review but it is way cheaper than the "Superphones" like the Evo 4G and DroidX. I needed 4 smartphones for myself, my wife and 2 kids. Any of the 1ghz phones would have been over $900 with contract. I got the 4 Arias for $98. The small screen may not have big specs but it looks great. The phone feels fast. I love it and the kids love it. My daughter really wanted an iPhone 4 but now she loves the Aria. The battery life has been good for all 4 of us so far. My wife gets 2-3 days out of hers while the always-online 14 year old daughter has to charge at the end of the night. The 5mp camera is great even without a flash. The video is OK but not nearly as good as the stills. It comes with a 2gb micro SD card so I will have to replace that but for the price I can understand why a larger card wasn't included. I did not like the small virtual keyboard at first but after 2-3 days I got used to it. In my opinion some Android phones look and feel a bit clunky. This is not one of them. I am somewhat of an Apple fanboy and was worried that I would have some buyer's remorse getting an Aria instead of the iPhone4. So far I am happy with the choice and have no regrets.. Updated. on Jul 30, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. The phone operations are flawless.. 2. I can change the home screen to fit my style (unlike the I-phone). 3. It fits nicely in my hands (I am a woman, but not a tiny one).. 4. It has adobe FLASH! (again, unlike the I-phone). 
Cons:. 1. No camera flash. 2. At&#38;t restricts you from non android marketplace applications. 
Summary:. Overall, HTC hit the mark with this phone. It is not too bulky to fit nicely in your pocket, nor too small to be productive. Don't let it's diminutive size fool you, consider it to be a humble pocket giant. Both my husband and I tend to like windows mobile phones, however, this android has wormed its way into our hearts. There are a few quirks, as noted above, but the phone in its entirety is great. Unlike my husband, I do not spend time looking for obscure applications from the web, so my only true con (no camera flash) can be easily resolved by &lt;gasp&gt; using my REAL camera. ;) He has not purchased the Aria as of yet because he is waiting to see if htc wins his heart with a new(er) android/windows mobile super phone that may be coming out this Fall/Winter. He tends to prefer a phone with a keyboard (not sure if the htc android will ever have one). Also, some have complained about the screen size. Switching over from the htc Tilt, this wasn't much of a problem for me considering the Aria is bigger. In all honesty the screen is a decent size (think back five years to your PDA or flip phone).. At any rate, do not be fooled into believing the "innovative" Apple I-phone is a better device. Far from it, actually. Unlike the I-phone, with the Aria, you can watch any video online. Be it on the actual youtube site or a video that is embedded in an article. They post it, you watch it! Ah yes and you can also manipulate your home screen to fit your personal style. Call me OCD or not, but I know that seeing the numerous applications that show up ALL the time on the I-phone would make my eyes twitch. I prefer the clean home-screen with a date, time, internet...etc.. Advice: if you are interested in this wonderful phone (and you should be by now) I suggest you read up on it before purchasing it. I say this because I had a comical experience in-store with a representative that not only failed to know any of the answers to my questions, but she also said (on numerous occasions ) " I don't know, but the I-phone..." Does nothing else exist but that "innovative", restricted, cult forming device? Answer, yes! There are some fabulous alternatives that utilize the same technology.. Smart intelligent people unite, buy the Aria.. Updated. on Jul 6, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. I have been an avid iPhone user for 2 years now and the Aria has been above and beyond my expectations. The processor is quick and perky and the screen is vibrant. The phone is very light and small.. 
Cons:. The keyboard can be quite messy and laggy compared to the iPhone. Its small size can be a con too. Sometimes its hard for me to hold onto the phone and type multiple text messages.. 
Summary:. Overall I believe that this phone is just as or better than the iPhone. The widgets help break up the mundane. I would recommend this phone to anyone who isn't willing to shell out the extra cash for a iPhone 4 or is not looking for a iPhone but would like to upgrade what they have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of features, nice layout, fast web browser, does not lag, takes good videos and pictures even without a flash. 
Cons:. Poor battery life and small screen.. 
Summary:. I replaced my samsung impression with this phone. I had this phone for 5 days and I am loving it! Although ATT crippled it, I was able to get some good android apps. Could have gotten better if ATT did not lock phone. This phone is a keeper! If you are looking for a compact but fast phone, get the Aria! If your fingers a big, texting might be difficult. The screen is small in size but the phones performance is very good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick 600MHz processor. Pocket friendly. Runs Android with HTC Sense. 
Cons:. Battery life. AT&#38;T blocks third party apps. 
Summary:. I got the HTC Aria and it is by far the best alternative phone to the Iphone on AT&#38;T right now. It might not be the best android phone out there but i'm glad that AT&#38;T finally got a real Android phone on board.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, great graphics, small and fits into pocket easily without being bulky. 
Cons:. No live wallpaper, small keyboard, speaker not very loud. 
Summary:. Great phone overall. I bought it the day it came out. AT&#38;T is finally getting on the andriod bandwagon. Updated. on Jul 20, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Android 2.1. 2. Auto-Focus 5.0 camera. 3. Texting is a breeze. 4. HTC Sence. 5. 3.2 screen is bright and vibrant. 6. Great reception and call quality. 7. Tons of free apps. 8. Google integration. 9. MP3 player with 3.5mm audio jack. 
Cons:. 1. Battery life. 2. No Flash (camera or Adobe). 3. SD card inside battery cover. 4. no native side-load of apps. 5. Optical joystick is rather small (ok, I'm stretching). 
Summary:. This is my first (real) Android phone for AT&#38;T. Started with an unlocked G1, and that just gave me a taste for more. When Best Buy started their Free Friday phones on the first week of Oct, they had the Aria, so i decided to give it a try. Glad I did.. Been just under a month now, and I can honestly say that I love the Aria. Did the research on AT&#38;T's removal of the ability to side-load apps. No big deal, downloaded the Android Central Sideload Wonder Machine, and it works fine. Only down-side (I guess) is that you need to 'usb' the Aria to computer in order for it to work. It's a fine work-around.. As much as I love HTC Sence, as it's a better skin than that of Moto-Blur. I thought I would be fine with HTC's regular keyboard, but ended up staying with Better Keyboard with the iPhone skin over that. Combine it with Handcent SMS, and you got one fine texting experience.. One thing I love on this is more Android over iOS. Free apps, and that you can download them without inputting a password every single time. One, only one did I ever pay for an Android app, mainly because I use WidgetLocker alot more and the ad's started to bug me. You get much more functionality than the stock screen lock.. Another Android related thing is that it's running 2.1. Just waiting (impatiantly) for 2.2 and it's Flash and apps to SD Card abilities.. Back to the Aria as a phone. Reception is no worse or better, so it's a good thing. Always got good reception almost everywhere with a few spots that I know it just wont work. Still get 1 bar out of it for most that for most of those spots.. I get my usual ringtones and MP3 music out of it. Not sure if it's me or the Aria, sometimes i think it's too soft, sometimes it's way too loud. I guess I still have to mess around with the volume.. Not going to get much into the battery. All my smart phones, 8125, 8525, Treo 750 (all HTC) all last about a day and have to recharge every night. So this is no different.. A lot of ppl are complaining about the screen size. Yes, I'll give you that compared to Evo or Incredible. But remember a time when PDA screens were 3.2 and that was considered big? To me, this is no different. At least I don't have to hassle with portability of the phone, and has just enough room for texting. Going back to Better Keyboard with the iPhone skin. So much better.. The 5.0MP camera is great with auto-focus. Sharp and bright (good lighting). It sucks that there is no flash on it, but then again. With any phone, better to get a real camera. For that quick picture and send to Facebook, it gets what you need done.. Well, hope that this helps. It's just my two cents with my Aria, and I don't think you will go wrong with the phone either.. 

$$;
Pros:. Where do I start? :). 
Cons:. Battery life. Have to charge it daily without even using bluetooth.. 
Summary:. Great, cool, reliable phone. Extend battery life and it will be perfect..

Pros:. Size. Speed. Text prediction. 7 home screens. Track pad. Camera. 
Cons:. Cramped keyboard. Battery. Texting app bug. Speaker. No flash. 
Summary:. So I'm test driving this phone. Over all I do like it. I mostly picked it because I like the size. I always carry my phone in my pocket. So the smaller size was appealing. And for it's size, the processor was plenty fast for my uses.. A lot of the cons I listed have been listed multiple times by others. Not wanting to be redundant, I still feel I need to be honest and list my experiences. The cramped size of the keyboard was expected. Even though expected, it does take time to get used to and can be frustrating. The text prediction helps a ton. I found I misspell over half of the time because of the small keyboard. But the text prediction corrects it almost every time.. The real problem with the cramped keyboard isn't the keyboard itself. The problem is with the touch sensitive buttons at the bottom of the screen. Since they are touch sensitive, instead of being physical keys, I've found it's very easy to hit them while working/playing with something. For instance, while texting, I will accidentally hit the home key and it will completely kick you out of the text message you were working on.. The battery is a pain, but I'm not sure it's much different than other smartphones.. The speaker could be better. When using speaker phone, and more importantly the ringer and alarms, the sound could be louder. But I think that's also something I could live with.. The real problem I have had so far with the Aria is that there is a bug with the texting app. While texting, sometimes the text predictability will crash. You'll get an error message that says you have to close the app. The only way to get the app to work again is to reboot the phone. Obviously this can be a huge issue. I've been having to reboot the phone a couple of times a day. From reading on an HTC site, HTC is aware of the problem but have yet to create a fix.. The speed of the phone seems great to me. I haven't experienced any lag or crashes (aside from the texting bug).. 

$$;
Pros:. It's compact, responsive and intelligent in the little things... such as activating the screen when I bring the phone down from my ear.. 
Cons:. Can't remove or at least prevent the loading of apps like Stocks, News or Navigator. This makes the poor battery life even more frustrating.. 
Summary:. This is an amazing phone! Mind you, coming from an HTC Tilt may not be saying much. However, I'm certain I will never go back to a Windows phone as they're too much about Windows and not enough about phone. The battery life is the most frustrating thing. If the unwanted data-intensive apps could be removed users might not be as frustrated about the battery life. I'm optimistic that my battery will begin performing better over time (we'll see).. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone is sleek and powerful. While it isn't as fast as other Android phones, it is excellent for its size. It is smaller than the other major htcs so its easy to carry around. Screen is bright, simple keyboard, great applications. User friendly.. 
Cons:. If you ever drop phones, definitely get a good strong cover for the phone. If dropped, your screen will almost certainly shatter, and because of the touch screen glass the phone will cut you if you break or crack the screen and try to use it.. 
Summary:. Get the phone. Get a cover. Don't leave apps on as overheating could be an issue. But in general. It's a great phone, I love it, it is very user friendly. I'm writing this review on it now, so it shows how easy the keyboard is to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very user friendly. good pictures, compact design for pocket. good speed and use full functions. i love this phone.. 
Cons:. no flash light. No option to categorize programs. All installed programs will be under the program list, searching for one will be tough job.. 
Summary:. A good compact phone. 

$$;
Pros:. Operating System, Display, Compact, Rubber backing, Awesome Camera, Wallpaper weather animation. The phone is a great little phone. Very easy to work right outta the box.. 
Cons:. Speakerphone could be louder, keyboard is kinda small but managable, small phone storage space. Bloatware unremovable.. 
Summary:. For a small phone this puppy packs a punch. I have had the phone for about 2months now and I really love it. The cons I said are just little things that I can work with. Except for the bloatware being unremovable! Come on AT&#38;T are you kidding me? Trying to free up space wouldnt be a problem if you could remove some apps you wont use.. 

$$;
Pros:. android 2.1. responsive HTC sense. almost like an iphone in some ways. 
Cons:. battery life!! i hate it!. speaker phone wasn't that loud at all. no voice dial for my bluetooth in my car :(. 
Summary:. i used to have LG VU and that is the worst phone i ever had. touch screen was bad and the battery life was the worst and i have to replace the battery 2x times before i decide to check out HTCs.. and it is the best phone i had and i didn't regret it even though my peers keeps tellng me to get the iphone4 instead. the phone is great and it has some apps that is useful, though AT&#38;T crippled it with some 3rd party apps. screen is kinda small and i usually use the landscape to text instead of portrait mode. the only hing i missed in my LG VU is the voice dial for my bluetooth in my car. anyways it is a great phone and you will not get dissapointed on this. i highly recomend it!. 

$$;
Pros:. simple to use nice size for pocket. 
Cons:. battery life. 
Summary:. This is a great phone for average use I left iphone 3g and am real happy with the Aria. Although I use a imac at home i had to buy software to sync with my mac works great. (google missingsync to get it) I just wish Steve Jobs would let me have all my music!!. 

$$;
Pros:. HTC Sense, Android 2.1, Zippy, Vibrant screen. 
Cons:. Battery life drains with moderate use.. 
Summary:. This is my first touch screen phone and so far I am very impressed. The small size isn't as big of a problem for texting as I thought it would be. When "sideways" there is ample room for even my large fingers. Though it doesn't have the 1ghz processor like the incredible, it still is very zippy with little lag. My only real frustration was the HTC Sense facebook app that comes with the phone only allows syncing with contact pictures for the first 100 facebook friends. Of those, I only had about 20 contacts in my phone. Simple fix was downloading an android app from the market. Also, the battery life is just okay. With moderate use (internet, android market, games, etc) the battery needs charging before the end of the day. Overall I am very impressed with this little phone. I would have to say I love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Feature rich Android phone, great size, 5 MP camera, really cool yellow background under battery cover.. 
Cons:. AT&#38;T has locked down the external app installer, not a flagship phone, screen resolution could be higher.. 
Summary:. AT&#38;T finally has an Android phone that isn?t embarrassing like the Motorola Backflip. Definitely worth checking out.. The phone has a nice build that feels firm and a soft touch to the back. The accents definitely highlight the style that HTC is going after. The 3.2? Capacitive touch screen (480 x 320) could be bigger, but it does give you enough room to work with what?s on the screen. HTC?s Aria also sports 600MHz MSM 7227 processor coupled with 512 MB rom and 384 mb ram. Although not the speediest of the phones, this phone does give good performance in everyday use. We?d like to consider it a keyboardless, cuter version of the Motorola Droid (yes we are aware these are two completely different companies).. read full review at.... http://semiprose.com/2010/07/14/review-htc-aria/. Thanks!. 

$$;
Pros:. The Aria is easy and fun to use. It's fast with everything anyone could ever want in a smartphone.. 
Cons:. The battery life is terrible. I have to charge at least once a day, usually twice, and I am a moderate texter and pretty low internet user. Luckily, the phone has a mini-usb charger and can recharge from a computer or wall socket.. 
Summary:. This phone is great, especially for it's price. Just make sure you have a charger handy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size. HTC Sense. Android 2.1. Rooted. 
Cons:. BAD BATTERY LIFE. AT&#38;T bloatware. No non-marketplace apps. 
Summary:. I love this little phone. I can barely feel it in my pocket. Other then the fact that AT&#38;T crippled it, it's the best mid-range Android out there. The battery life is a problem for me, for the last 3 days, the phone died on me before 9pm everyday with moderate use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots. Fantastic build, layout and screen. Easy to link to my office mail, calendar &#38; reminders. Powerful, yet reasonably sized. Call quality is fab!! Camera has many settings. The shots I've taken both in and out have been very good.. 
Cons:. Just one that I've found. The battery needs daily charging. I've taken indoor shots with the phone that have been fine but the shutter lag might be seen as a con.. 
Summary:. I bought this phone the day it hit the stores but I wasn't waiting on it. I was just there to finally upgrade though I hadn't seen anything in person that met my desired criteria. I was going to go with the HTC Tilt2 but it's the size of a DVR remote and weighs a ton. Sitting right next to it on display was a phone that I'd not seen before. The Aria. I had them bring out a charged phone and in 10 seconds I knew I was taking it home. The HTC Aria is a very solid phone in a well made, compact form.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size. Android software. Battery life. 
Cons:. Small Size. No third paty apps. 
Summary:. I bought this phone the first day it come out, and so far I'm impressed big time. This is my first smartphone and touchscreen phone so it'll take time to definitely get used to. Its a great size, fits perfectly in the had and so far have been using it nonstop and the battery is still 3/4 full.. If you have big fingers, I dont recommend this phone because of the small screen, I don't have a problem with the keyboard at all. They also have a landscape mode for the keyboard which helps.. Hopefully At&#38;T can keep the android phones coming.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone is outstanding in every way except for the worst ever audio speaker.. 
Cons:. This may not be important to everyone, but the speaker is the worst of any other cell phone on the market. The equalization is "painfully" high on the high end . . just awful . . and there is no eqaulaizer. Cannot be used for occasional music.. 
Summary:. This may not be important to everyone, but the speaker is the worst of all cell phone I have tested. It may be lame, but I listen to music about 50% without earphones, because I don't always carry earphones around. No phone is going to sound great but some are usable for music. I gave up a simple T-Mobile Nokio 6301 for the HTC Aria. The Nokiia was good for a cell phone. When I took the Aria back to the ATT dealer to look for another model, the sales person said the sound was "PAINFULL" when I played a few seconds of music. It is PAINFULL . . with the equalization like 10x on the high frequencys . . comlpletly unusable for music. The saleman's IPhone sounded great by comparison. I am trading the Aria for an Iphone, even though I would otherwise prefer the Aria.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light Weight. Fast. Sense UI. 
Cons:. Battery Door. They put the antenna in the door and the battery door doesn't fit securely. there are issues about this posted on the Web. It is crippled by ATT and the accessories are very hard to find. Voice Quality and Battery life ar subpar. 
Summary:. I really like the phone idea but ATT didn't execute it properly. They're too busy pushing a horrible iphone and that appears to be where all of their energy is. They also will not let us know when or if this phone will get a 2.2 update. Updated. on Jul 17, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Android, HTC Sense, Compact form factor, performance. 
Cons:. Screen Size, no flash. 
Summary:. FINALLY! A good phone landed on AT&#38;T's sinking ship! Even though this is already a great phone, it COULD be better if the screen wasn't so damn small. I mean, I like the compact-ness of it so it's actually comfortable to use (unlike the Evo) but my thumbs aren't really that small so I can imagine typing might be an issue for me. Until I can make any conclusions, I'm gonna have to go to the store and check it out. But as far as it goes, it's probably the best AT&#38;T alternative to the iPhone... as of right now. Updated. on Jun 26, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Android. Not the iPhone. user friendly. rubber backing. fast response to commands. very customizable. 
Cons:. Very, VERY fragile, if you drop it...expect it to break.. keyboard sometimes becomes unresponsive. camera. speaker phone aspect either really loud or too low. no good middle ground.. lack of a good music player. battery life sucks. 
Summary:. I was very excited to rid myself of the iPhone, and after much research went with the HTC Aria. All I have to say is buyer beware. I don't know what HTC was thinking, but they obviously don't expect people to drop their phones. Because a week into owning it, it fell out of my stroller and the screen completely shattered. I mean bad. HTC refused to do anything to help. Stating that I shouldn't have dropped my phone. (I know...great customer service they do not have!) That is my major complaint with this phone. It's fragile. Once a case was finally available I bought one for the replacement phone I purchased. And while this phone is easy to use, and looks nice...the battery life sucks. I find the keyboard very easy to type on, and the phone offers a pretty decent response time. I don't know if it's AT&#38;T (i suspect it is) but the reliability of cell signal is hit or miss. But it works just as well, if not better than my iPhone ever did with the 3G and WiFi options. The speaker phone and overall volume of the phone are a bit sad. The speaker phone hurts your ears if at full volume, and with the speaker on the back of the phone, if you have it lying on a counter or seat the ring is muffled. The camera is difficult to use simply because you hit the scroll knob to take the pic, but one small move and you exit the camera altogether.. overall I am happy with this phone, but I think that is primarily because my iPhone 3G got SO messed up from the O/S4 update. I do wish the Android Marketplace would hurry up and catch up with the iPhone's. And in my opinion, I have yet to find anything as easy as buying music from iTunes. So, I do miss that. But as far as phone quality goes....the Aria is far superior. Far, far superior, and that is exactly what I was looking for. HTC could really take a queue from Apple though as far as their customer service is concerned, because folks...it sucks.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well the phone is very small and runs pretty fast for its size. 
Cons:. The phone is only running 2.1 android, cannot run some of the apps other android phones can, and cannot use live wallpapers. 
Summary:. When I first got the phone I loved I couldnt put it down but then when I had noticed that some of the apps on my EVO werent on the aria I got frustrated I also got frustrated that it cannot use live wallpapers but besides those flawes the rest of the phone was pretty good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome to surf and play games with. Love the screen. Lots of cool gadgets. 
Cons:. Battery must be charged twice a day on average. In-call sound quality is utterly awful. Unremovable ATandT killer bloatware. 
Summary:. This is my first Android phone, and while I love android, HTC's ability to create a good PHONE leaves a bit to be desired. I don't use a bluetooth earpiece, because I've had yet to find one that fits comfortably. This means the phone's regular speakers need to be decent at least. Alas, that isn't the case with the Aria. I actually returned the first phone, because the sound was so low that you had to be in an almost silent room to have a phone conversation. The replacement phone is only slightly better. Very slightly. And I can simply forget using the speaker phone, as the voices come out so broken up and garbled that its impossible to carry on a conversation. While the sound in earphones is quite good, the lack of speaker quality is a deal-breaker for me.. And that's too bad, because I love the Aria's ease of use and quality otherwise. Surfing the net is amazingly fast and easy for the most part, so much so that I've sometimes used the phone to surf rather than bothering to turn on my computer. The phone's various widgets (those not controlled by ATandT's "let's make 'em pay for EVERYTHING attitude) work very well--and I love the many free games and apps available in the Android Marketplace.. Unfortunately, playing with those games and apps drains the battery very, very quickly; I've yet to get even a full day's worth of charge out of this phone. If you buy one, be sure to get a car charger if you're going to be out and about--believe me, you'll use it A LOT. One app you will definitely want to download to help with that is some sort of app-killer program. That will help save some of the battery life.. The gist of all this? While the HTC Aria is a fun little (I love the size, by the way) Android device, if you need an actual phone, and like me, can't use a bluetooth headset, you might want to go with a different phone. I wish, at this point, that I'd either waited for the Galaxy S phones to come out, or returned this one before the return date. I would recommend it to a friend, but only with serious reservations.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up and use, 7 separate screens are very flexible and customizable, pretty fast.. 
Cons:. battery life is lacking, CURRENTLY FACEBOOK DOES NOT SYNC USING HTC SENSE. BE CAREFUL!. 
Summary:. This is a very good phone. However I am pretty dissapointed that since I have had the phone - HTC SENSE - the big reason I got this phone - does not work with face Book. There is an HTC/Face Book problem that has been going on for over a week now. Nobody can sync their contacts with Face Book for HTC sense which is the company's biggest selling point with the phone. HTC needs to get their act in gear. Otherwise, it is a good phone. 

$$;
Pros:. cool user interface, sexy overall look, lots of nice features.. 
Cons:. battery life was MUCH shorter than advertised, call clarity seems lower than my old blackberry curve, and the speakerphone is, in my opinion, really poor.. 
Summary:. Updated. on Jul 20, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. I like how gmail push works and how everything the phone does is largely not intrusive.. 
Cons:. If you type too fast, it'll crash, won't let you type, and you have to restart it. Let's b honest, what good is a phone that doesn't let you type? Also, contact copying apps may not work properly so get your contacts on the sim or vcard format first.. 
Summary:. I'd consider your options before buying this phone, first gen users always get the short straw. I moved back to my iPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pocket size, great web browser, love the pinch and enlarge or decrease screen, love the homescreen display with time and weather, it is a fun phone to entertain yourself with.. 
Cons:. Drops calls, fails to complete calls, email difficult to set up, had to do complete reset of phone because it wouldn't make/receive calls to my son's cell phone, battery sucks, can't download songs as ring tone, ATT does not offer ringtones for Aria.. 
Summary:. I have had my phone for 2 weeks. It is so much fun to sit around and play with. Unfortunately, it falters at it's main function...reliable mobile phone. I don't know if it is because I came from a Blackberry and it's call quality and reliability are so superior or what. But there are places I could use my Blackberry that my Aria will not work. I never had a dropped call on my BB either and this one drops calls on a daily basis and my husband says when he talks to me on the Aria, the sound quality isn't nearly as good and I break up alot. I have even had to do a reset on my phone because it just suddenly became unable to receive or complete calls to my son's cell phone. Strange!!! It even had tech support perplexed. They checked out both our phones and determined his was doing what it was supposed to, but mine was malfunctioning. If you are looking for a toy and don't mind unreliable phone service, go ahead and purchase it, but I am taking my back and getting the BB Bold 9700. It may not be as much fun to "play" with but BB's are amazing tools that do what I need them to do, when I need them to do it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pretty UI, good integration of facebook and htc sense. 
Cons:. Unstable OS, apps and utilities such as the keyboard component would crash for no reason... I've just returned it. 
Summary:. If you're not a heavy user, just go and get it... otherwise go for something more powerful.. 

$$;
Pros:. The ability to download files on the go and view flash webpages. Custom notification settings.. 
Cons:. Couldn't fit them all here. See below in the "bottom line summary".. 
Summary:. Keyboard is a little too small. Email integration is terrible. Smart links only work sometimes. A lot of the HTC widgets don't update unless you open the program, so why have a widget? Calls sound hollow. Speaker is tinny and quiet. The build quality is horrible, no way this things lasting through a 2 year contract. Apps randomly launch in the background and I've used three different task managers.. I came from an iPhone and am going right back. The idea of the sense UI is genius, once it actually works in a few years ill be all over it. Until then you simply can't beat the iPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. good size fast able to run multi apps. 
Cons:. cannot see at all in sunlight touch screen does not always work if you use as phone only battery last about 8 hours any other apps 5 hours att loaded it with their junk. 
Summary:. if you are not sitting next to a power outlet this product will fail battery life is a joke please read the fourm's about this phone from all websites you will see that HTC failed on this one. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek and smart. 
Cons:. Extremely fragile, glass front that should not crack and break like an egg shell! One slip out of your hands, one drop, and it's toast.. 

$$;
Pros:. Battery life (WiFi turned off), speed, application variety. 
Cons:. Extremely fragile. 
Summary:. Unless you like to pamper your phone, don't buy this one. I have had mine for two weeks, loved it. I wanted to change the Micro SD card, so I tried to remove the battery cover (which is very difficult to do by the way). In attempting to remove the cover, the screen shattered, yes, completely shattered. I didn't drop it, step on it or throw it (all things that happened with my Blackberry with no damage). I can only imagine what would have happened if I would have dropped it. I cannot imagine going two years (length of my contract) without ever dropping my phone. HTC R&#38;D department, you had better go back to the drawing board. Overall I would have to give this phone a very good rating, however, do to it's frailty, I can give it no more than one half a star.. 

$$;
Pros:. nothing really.. 
Cons:. everything, bad call volume, bad battery, stupid navigation, just plain bad for the price. 
Summary:. After an i phone... this thing sux..
