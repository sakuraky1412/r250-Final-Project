Pros:. Excellent blu-ray player. I bought the bdp-s350 model and owned it for about 4 weeks now. The moves load relatively fast about 10 second?s average. Would recommend it to any one.. 
Cons:. Would be nice if it had Netflix.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have a PS3 too but this is better on the Blu-ray/upscale side.. The material "AVCHD" or BD films catch the precise frame rate. The PS3 played "AVCHD" in 25p fps in 50interlaced. This player gets it right.. The sound is better than the PS3.. 
Cons:. None so far.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is second to none, attractive design, ethernet for firmware update and BR Live. Upscales standard DVD to rival BR disc.. 
Cons:. Honestly nothing I can think of.. 
Summary:. What most impressed me about this player is it's standard DVD upscaling. I have often mistaken standard DVD for BR disc. This player will not disappoint.. 

$$;
Pros:. This player has played every thing that I have put in it.. This unit has not skipped a beat.I cannot say that for the Samsung BDP 1500.. I bought the Sony and have not looked back. Easy to use plays every thing ,and sounds great through a THX2 Onkyo. 
Cons:. A little slow loading up a Movie.From power on until you load the movie takes a little longer than I would like. I guess patience is a virtue!. 
Summary:. All around player that is not buggy.I have to give it 5 Stars.. You can probably find a player that has a few more bangs and whistles,but at what cost. Sony invented BlueRay.. Buyer beware not all Blue Ray players made by other companys will play all Blue Rays. Sorry Samsung BDP1500. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Great video. 2. Onboard decoding of all existing audio formats (great if you don't have a newer receiver). 3. Price as compared to other players. 4. Many settings to customize the player as you want it. 
Cons:. 1. Referring to Pro #4, settings can be confusing if you aren't that tech-proficient. 2. Loading of movies are slower than a DVD.. 3. BD-Live has little to no content. 
Summary:. I got this on Black Friday. After owning this for just over a month, I now feel qualified to give an opinion on this player. First off, it is a gret player for the price as of right now. Of course, you can expect blu ray players to continue dropping in price.. The video when compared to DVD is like night and day. I saw the same movie on multiple players and the only player that looked better, albeit only slightly for a much bigger price, was the Panasonic.. The audio is amazing but can be confusing to configure with a receiver. I had problems w/ my Onkyo 605, which I finally solved by looking on an online forum.. As far as the common complaint that the USB slot is too small, with the small sizes of most current USB drives, you should find it an issue any longer.. Also, a firmware update was quick and simple when I first connected the player to the Internet.. Bottom line is that this is a great player for the price. There are others but not in this price point. If you can find this for $200 or under, which I did, jump on it!. 

$$;
Pros:. It's small, it's quiet, it updates firmware over the Internet, it can output full bitstream of any codec to my receiver, it has a great set of adjustments available.. 
Cons:. Price... we'll all be embarrassed in a couple of years that these things were so expensive, but, you know, whatever..... 
Summary:. I'm far more of an audiophile than a videophile, and I maintain that the "movie theater experience" has far more to do with having proper audio than enormous (or even HD) video. So far, I've watched some Blu-ray movies thanks for Netflix (The Simpsons Movie, Wanted, etc) and they were great, but I don't generally purchase movies. I do purchase concert DVD's though (you can watch concerts over and over, just like listening to CD's) and there's just nothing like DTS HD-Master Audio or Dolby True HD with an HD video for a concert... good lord, that's amazing.. I output bitstream to my Yamaha RX-V3800, which has all of the codecs I'm interested in onboard. I've purchased Chris Botti's "Live in Concert with Orchestra and Friends", and Pat Metheny Group's "The Way Up - Live", and if you like concert videos, you owe it to yourself to see these in Blu-ray. These are the best looking, best sounding concerts I've ever experienced, and I'm looking forward to the continued spread of Blu-ray into video productions, especially recordings of classical concerts, but really, anything with music on it in a lossless codec (both True HD and HD-Master Audio are lossless) is so worth owning.. Anyway, since I already own an Xbox 360, I didn't want another gaming platform, and I have all the means to stream my recorded content onto my stereo and screen with other pieces, so I wanted a standalone Blu-ray player. The Sony BDP-S350 has been everything I could have wanted... no complaints. Solid configuration options, good loading times, nice remote control. You won't go wrong with this player if your receiver can decode DTS HD-Master Audio. If you need a Blu-ray that decodes that before sending audio to the amp, then you'll want to look elsewhere, because having DTS HD-Master Audio really is worth hearing.. 

$$;
Pros:. EXCELLENT PICTURE QUALITY. FASTER LOAD TIMES THAN ORIGINAL PLAYERS. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS UNIT. SOUND IS SIMPLY AMAZING TOO.. 
Cons:. I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY SO FAR.. 
Summary:. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLAYER TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A QUALITY UNIT WITHOUT BREAKING THE BANK. I WOULD PUT THIS PLAYER AGAINST A LOT OF PLAYERS COSTING THREE TIMES AS MUCH. IT MAY NOT HAVE SOME OF THE FEATURES THE MORE EXPENSIVE PLAYERS DO BUT FOR WHAT IT WAS MADE FOR,(PLAYING MOVIES IN BLU-RAY OR REGULAR DVD) IT CAN'T BE BEAT. I ORIGINALLY HAD A TOSHIBA HD-DVD PLAYER LAST YEAR AND THE PICTURE ON THE BLU-RAY DOES SEEM A LITTLE CLEANER. NOT AS GRAINY ESPECIALLY ON DARK SCENES. UNLESS YOU HAVE TO HAVE BRAGGING RIGHTS AND PURCHASE A REDICULOUSLY OVER PRICED BLU-RAY( DENON, ELITE, ETC) THIS PLAYER WILL SERVE YOU WELL. LOOK AT THE PICTURE SIDE BY SIDE ON THE SAME BRAND TELEVISION AND YOU WILL NOT SEE A DIFFERENCE IN PICTURE QUALITY. SOMETIMES THE RETAILER WILL PLACE A MORE EXPENSIVE PLAYER WITH A MORE EXPENSIVE TELEVISION TO MAKE YOU THINK THE PLAYER IS BETTER. SO BE CAREFUL AND DON'T FALL FOR THEIR SALES GIMMICKS.. 

$$;
Pros:. EVERYTHING! I exchanged a BDP300.(slowest load time ever)for the BDPBX1 (I got mine at Costco.you can't beat their exchange policy). It is compact, good looking and loads like a fully automatic Beretta!. 
Cons:. I have had this about 45 days and so far its flawless operation leaves me complaintless. Issues may show up but none yet..thats a great feeling so far!. 
Summary:. There appears to be nothing about this player (yet) that i dislike and were there any thing I did seriously dislike I would drive 30 miles, one way, to Costco and get rid of it...in fact I did just that with my previous Sony Blu Ray Player purchase which, by the way was $50 MORE than the BDPBX1...now thats saying someting!. When I HDMI'd this sweetheart into my precious VIZIO SV470XMTai/120hz/Smooth Motion LCD HDTV and put on National Treasure 2, I was absolutely balowned out of my massage recliner! I can not believe that an old fart like me (70), living on SSA, can enjoy what may be the very finest video experience available on planet earth and do so for what, for a combined cost of under $1700. Well let me tell you thats saying something. I live in a 32' vintage Holiday Rambler (1973) trailer in small but perfect comfort. When my lights go out at night and I crank up a Blu Ray disc freshly mailed to me by Block Buster (I get 3 BluRay discs per week like clockwork in the mail for $20 bucks per month so who says a poor man can't live like a King if he keeps his vices to a minimum and shops wisely for entertainment gear that may be the last he will ever purchase in this life!). My wee environment lights up like wrap around 3D Cinerama when I saw that for the first time back in the....oh yeah 1960s! I have my micro a few steps away so popcorn is always freash and I can sip on an ocassional Russo Negro withouth guilt. This is possible with the BDPBXI (same as S300 I have come to learn) and the spectacular Vizio for which the closest competing units were running upwards of 2500-3500k but a couple of months back. My "review" really is for BOTH the Vizio product (which in my wee environment produces more than adequate Surround Sound without a costly audio reciever. Oh, if I want wireless 5.1 it truns out VIZIO can sell me a 5.1 wireless speaker set using the 3 onboard speakers and two outside wireless...already to rock if I wish to spend a mere $300 more and I will, as soon as I save up enough to add the 5.1 kit to the 5.1 Vizio set I own. Damn I love writing such an upbeat "review" on two different mfgers products. IIts so EZ to find things to complain about these days! But not with these two very fine high quality products in myi life.. Thats now near 2500 characters in my "review". I could write more but its Blu Ray movie time in my digs...Just got Space Odessy 2001...can't wait to see OLD HAL rap with Kier D in 1080p Blu Ray...lights down, movie starting in 3...2...tadaa!. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything runs really well. Upconversion of DVD material is outstanding. The player outputs Dolby True HD and the sound is out of this world.. 
Cons:. No Cons at all.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set-up. Quick start up. Great picture and sound. Great value.. 
Cons:. Recessed USB memory input - but can easily be overcome.. Quality so good it makes HD TV look poor in comparison!. 
Summary:. The picture quality will blow you away as soon as you set this player up. The player will really bring out the best out of the high def LCD monitor you spent all those dollars on. The fluid menu system will allow you to quickly set up the system to best suit the your other equipment and your personal tastes. The player is very quiet and the imagine quality is jaw dropping. It is hard to believe that a player that is relatively cheap can make such a large difference to your home movie experience. With Besy Buy currently throwing in a copy of the excellent Godfather trilogy for nothing the player is a no brainer. Enjoy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. price - in a couple of years players will be better and cheaper. 
Summary:. I had a PS3 for the sole purpose of watching movies. I understand why many places use it as their reference blu-ray player, but it gets way too warm for small spaces. I am now able to watch movies in my bedroom without having to crank the A/C. I have good home theater gear, which takes advantage of the player's potential SQ and PQ output. I am very impressed. No discernible difference in PQ between the PS3 and the S350. Although, there is a significant difference in DVD upconversion quality between the two with the S350 coming on top by a wide margin. AQ seems to be a bit sweeter now that my Pioneer Elite 94TX is decoding the HD codecs. I understand there really is no theoretical difference of SQ between the PS3 and bistreaming players, but my receivers decoding really does seem to be better-more dynamic. Ultimately, if you have a top tier receiver capable of decoding bistreamed HD codecs then opt for the S350 over the PS3. You will reduce the cost of your energy bill. I mean, aside from having to crank the A/C, it truly is a power hog. The PS3 is a multimedia powerhouse, thus it requires more power to be juiced up.. 

$$;
Pros:. super fast loading. very nice look.. 
Cons:. there is really nothing wrong with this player. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek Design, Easy Set Up.. 
Cons:. There Is None!. 
Summary:. I just got this the other day direct from Sony. This is my first Blu Ray player and it was money well spent. This Blu Ray player has all the features you could ask for. It plays Blu Ray disks superbly, has a sleek design, and is not a very big unit which means it can pretty much fit anywhere you want it to go. The picture, sound you name it was excellent when matched up with my Bravia 46inch Sony HD tv. I cant say enough about it except that Sony has delieverd in every way in my book with this Blu Ray player. I couldnt find anything wrong with it thats why I gave it a 10 and normally I wouldnt do that. I also want to throw in that the load time was very fast compared to other Blu Ray players I have seen in person. This is my very first Blu Ray player and it will be my only Blu Ray player for a very long time to come. If you want an excellent Blu Ray player then you have it in Sony's BDP-S350.. Thank you Sony!. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact Size. Reliable. Excellent Video/Audio Quality.. 
Cons:. Not as fast loading movies compared to today's players.. 
Summary:. I have has this player since August 2008, has not failed me since.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and sound quality. Good upscale quality.. 
Cons:. None so far.. 
Summary:. It got all the needs for a player and good quality for it price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cool design (good looking and lightweight), excellent playback (even on a standard HDTV), Superb upscaling.. 
Cons:. Quickstart consumes a LOT a power when "off".. 
Summary:. By far the most reliable BD player I�ve found. Its design makes it sight friendly, easy for taking it to a friend�s place (when my acquaintances first looked at it, they were surprised by its compact design compared to some relatively new DVD players). Its upscaling is great (I couldn�t find a BD title on BlockBuster and rented it on DVD, WOW...amazing picture). I�ve read reviews about its "hard to reach" USB port, but my old 1GB kingston traveller fit in there perfectly. Think about it, with game consoles, TiVo, and the other many boxes stuck everywhere on our media centers, you don�t need any other Netflix or YouTube capable device, so besides its poor quickstart thingy the best BD player I�ve ever played with.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful sleek design, better than Samsung! Extremely quiet with reasonable energy consumption. Recessed USB port (I own a tiny 8GB USB flash drive, it fits perfectly flush with the back of the player).. 
Cons:. No wireless connectivity (would be nice if Sony made this a standard feature for all of their blu-ray players). No support for common dvd-r and cd-r formats i.e. Divx and Mp3. 
Summary:. I recently had to upgrade my blu-ray system to the Sony BDP-S350 after my Magnavox blu-ray player stopped working. Fortunately, I was able to trade in the Magnavox, and with the help of a $100 gift card only paid 8 dollars in tax. That's that last time I ever buy another Magnavox product.. The player itself is very small. It's about the same size of my $40 upscaling dvd player, and it weighs less than the old Magnavox unit. Its shiny blue face plate just adds to its appeal. With the recessed USB slot in the back, you get to decide how much storage you want for the BD-Live feature.. There are some draw backs to this player. For such a state-of-the-art device, one would assume it would be capable of basic Divx and Mp3 playback, just like many other upscaling DVD models. Unfortunately it isn't, and users are restricted to burning in MPEG-2 or AVCHD format. Hopefully Sony will realize consumers' needs in playback compatibility and provide a firmware upgrade supporting additional formats.. Overall, it's a great product and would recommend it as a first-time buy. I took a chance with the lower end Magnavox unit and paid for it. From now on I'll only trust Sony for blu-ray technology.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to install. 
Cons:. Haven't found any. 
Summary:. Graet product especially if you got it as a gift!. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Ethernet connection doesn't seem to support WEP or WPA wireless security. 
Summary:. Excellent product, perhaps the wireless configuration will get handled in a firmware upgrade. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing picture quality, standard DVDs look nearly HD in quality. Easy set up. Attractive appearance. Ether net connection for firmware updates and BD Live connectivity. When using HDMI, can control some aspects of a compatible HDTV.. 
Cons:. Haven't really found any, yet.. 
Summary:. I am replacing a Sony first generation BDP-S1. I really liked the picture quality on my older unit, but the BDP-S350 actually beat the S1 in almost all respects. Also, the S1 was not compatible with regular CDs. The S350 is and using the digital output to my Denon receiver, the sound quality is the best I have had. It even sound better than my $1000 PS Audio Super Linc II outboard D to A converter. Great unit, especially when I paid less than half as much for the S350 than I did for the S1. My HD monitor is a Panasonic 58 inch plasma purchased in March and this player looks awesome on that TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and sound. nice menus.. 
Cons:. nothing so far.. 
Summary:. Easy to set up. I would recommend to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great quality, upconverting, &#38; QUIET!. 
Cons:. None as of yet.. 
Summary:. This is mostly a note for anyone considering a PS3 as a blu-ray player. I bought one this weekend on CNET's recommendation that it is a better blu-ray player than the BDP-S350. I returned it yesterday and bought the BDP-S350 and here's why: The PS3 has serious Fan Noise Issues! ...to the point, where it totally ruined my viewing experience. Do the research yourself. Google PS3 &#38; fan noise. You will see why a stand-alone Blu-Ray player isn't so bad after-all.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bitstreams latest codecs Dolby HD &#38; DTS HD Master. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. If you have a prepro or receiver that can decode the latest codecs, then this is a great player. If you want a player to do the decoding because you have older equipment, then wait for the s550 at about $200 more. This unit is extremely user friendly. Automatically setup internet connection and breezed through the set up screens and was watching Blade Runner with Dolby True HD sound within minutes.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent PQ, Bitstream audio output, Fast load times. 
Cons:. none thus far. 
Summary:. I've been interested in a standalone player that was relatively inexpensive, had good picture quality, and could output audio via bitstream for my receiver to handle. This Sony certainly fits the bill. A profile 2.0 player was not a concern of mine, but it's nice to know that this player can be upgraded in the future with a new firmware version. Thus far I have been very happy with the design, interface, video, and audio this player offers and would highly recommend it.. BTW CNET, we get it, you love the PS3... I just can't stand the constant comparison of all standalone players to the PS3. the inability to control the ps3 with a universal remote is in my opinion a huge deal breaker.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video quality, easy set-up, compact size, relatively quick. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. I did not need audio decoding and am perfectly happy with bitstream to modern Denon 3808ci receiver. Did not need a gaming machine, simply looking for a good bluray player that is quick to start, supports latest expanded color gamut standards, and provides full 7.1 audio vua bitstream for decoding by receiver. I also wanted a unit that could do 1080/24p (to be true to original film content). This player had everything I needed at a good price and was up and running 5 minutes after taking out of the box (driving a front projection Epson 1080ub in home theater with excellent picture and sound quality). Very pleased with product. BD Live may be a nice option in future, but I honestly don't care so much about that -- I'm mostly interested in watching movies with highest quality video and this product delivers.... 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture, easy set up, small size, remaining time display. 
Cons:. Control panel GUI cannot be turned off. 
Summary:. My previous Blu-ray player was a Sony until late last year when I purchased a Panasonic DMP-BD30 which had all the latest profile upgrades. The biggest problem with the Sony was its slow loading time.. With the BDP-S350, this has all changed for the better. Load time have vastly improved and it is a Profile 2.0 player. Picture quality is stunning, but most Blu-ray players display this picture.. One of the best features of this player is its size. Sony has been able to reduce the size of the player to just over a 2" height and only 8-3/4" deep. Sony's previous model was nearly 15" deep and just over 3" high.. Finally Sony adds a remaining time function to the display. Previous models only had a elapsed and total time display, so you had to do the remaining time in your head. Most Sony DVD players always had this function, but this is a first for their Blu-ray players.. Main complaint I have with this unit (a minor one) is that you cannot turn off Sony's GUI control panel (Xross Media Bar) over the desktop pattern--it is always on unless you are playing a disc. I use this player with a front projector and it looks tacky for guests seeing my control panel over the desktop. Sony didn't do this with their DVD players, so why do it with this new technology? About the only time you even need to use the GUI is when you are setting up the unit or add new equipment to the player.. All in all, Sony did a great job with this player. It's easy to set up and offers an outstanding picture.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast loading, suprisingly good upconversion, amazing picture.. 
Cons:. You will have to upgrade memory for BD live. Nothing Else.. 
Summary:. This player is really cool. It loads discs pretty fast. It's much smaller than the previous generation. Picture is amazing. Audio is also amazing. Upconversion is surprisingly good. Bravia sync works pretty well is you are also using a Sony T.V.. Only complaint is you have to upgrade memory for BD Live, but I knew that before buying. So far it is definitely worth the money for this player. Setup is simple. I couldn't be happier.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's plays blu-rays. The main screen is like the PS3. You can use it as a picture viewer. You can use it for music. It's very quiet. 
Cons:. Whenever your watching a blu-ray movie, it doesn't save the spot you where at in the movie when you turn it off.. 
Summary:. I won this Blu-Ray player at a party and was happy to have on it. It has worked great so far. The only thing that is disappointing is that it will not save your spot in a Blu-Ray movie. It will save it on a regular DVD, but not Blu-Ray. If your looking for a good Blu-Ray player I?d recommend this one. Just be sure to make note of where you are when turning your Blu-Ray movie off for the night.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Excellent Video Quality. - Bitsreams both DTS-HD MA and Dolby True HD. - Upscales DVD's very nicely. - Online update to BD-Live exceptionally easy and painless. - A PS3 for those of us that don't play games and don't want to buy a special remote. 
Cons:. - No onboard DTS-HD (not an issue if you have a receiver that can accept bitstream). - Not unique in its field (Panasonic BD-35 is same price with more features and equal video quality). 
Summary:. The Sony S350 is a 95% fully featured Blu-Ray Player, and the only thing that prevents me from giving it 5-Stars is its lack of an onboard DTS-HD MA decoder.. With that said, I got this on Black Friday 2008 at Walmart and had them price match K-Mart's ridiculously low price (even now) of $179. Turned out to be the best buy of the shopping weekend!. 

$$;
Pros:. -got it for around $200. -small form factor. -Profile 2.0 upgrade available over n/w. 
Cons:. - no problems as yet. 
Summary:. Nice little machine. I was waiting until prices for a decent player came down to around $200, and this one hit the mark.. Up-conversion seems slightly less effective than my oppo dvd player (bearing in mind that only 1 year ago, my Oppo cost $50 more than the sony player), but it really does a nice job ( so far ) on any blu-ray title I've seen.. The startup time seems very reasonable; I had read that bd boot time was an issue with some players.. Upgrading the fw is painless.. I have an older 720p Sony, so the resolution change from 480p is not really much of an issue ( especiallly since the oppo did an amazing up-conversion job) , but the color-space improvements are very noticeable ( no more color-banding ) , and fast-action sequences are very smooth.. I have no means to compare with any other blu-ray player, but my av life is a lot richer with this relatively inexpensive machine and a netflix blu-ray account upgrade. If you can get the $200 price or less, you probably will be happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. the price ,my wife bought me this player for christmas, .she paid just over half of what a ps3 costs,which finally makes a standallone bluray player worth while. the load times are great compared to other units i've looked at. .. 
Cons:. there is no zoom function.with my older dvd player i am able to zoom in in small incraments allowing me to fill my screen without stretching the image.this is an issue for me with dvd playback as i don't like having those black areas top and bottom.. 
Summary:. finally a well priced (on sale) standalone b/r player that makes sence to buy.fast loading.. 

$$;
Pros:. Provides clear, crisp movies, fast loading. 
Cons:. Will not play all standard and HD dvd's. 
Summary:. I really enjoy the player. The only dislike is that it will not play all HD dvd's as it states.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup, easy to update to 2.0 via internet. Great picture quality (I have a Dynex LCD 32" 720p) and the picture on blu-rays is AWESOME. Eveny makes regular DVD's look better. 
Cons:. None really so far..... 
Summary:. If you like Blu-Ray and like Sony...go ahead and get this player. Leave the audio decoding to the receiver..... 

$$;
Pros:. I love the picture on my HD 1080p. Way better picture than the upscaling player. Easy set-up.. 
Cons:. No clear list of accessories for player.. 
Summary:. I need a Sony USM1GH Memory stick, which I was able to locate on the Sony website. As far as getting the player able to be BD-Live, no one can tell me what I need to purchase to be BD-Live! Very frustrating. Does anyone know what I need to be BD-live? A place to purchase and a name of the product? Sony said I need a Wireless LAN Media Converter. Try looking that up online. Or better yet, call BestBuy; Costco; CompUSA; Tiger Direct; or best of all SONY. They don't know, do you????. On another line, the picture with my Blue Ray upscalling my regular DVD's is fantastic and the Blue Ray movies are totally awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome picture (even at only 720p), BD-Live and BonusView compatible after downloading update, easy setup right out of the box. Great size and fast startup.. 
Cons:. Very narrow USB port, no support for .mp3 discs. 
Summary:. I received this player just yesterday (Christmas gift) and have watched 3 BD movies on it so far. All I can say is AMAZING! Even my wife noticed a huge difference! She's already mentally shopping for a bigger TV! I only have a 1080i Samsung LCD but I have it output at 720p so as not to see the interlacing effect. Still an incredible picture compared to my Toshiba upconverting DVD player. Absolutely worth the money. Mine was on sale at Target for $249 with a $25 gift card when purchased! It's hard to believe that these things used to by $800-$1000 just a year ago!!! Even just 2 months ago this unit was $350. For those of you still without a gaming system (I already have an XBOX 360) you may want to consider the PS3. The only drawback to the PS3 (I've heard anyway) is that it will not upconvert your current DVDs, whereas the BDP-S350 will (and it does a great job I might add!) I don't know if that is actually true so you may want to ask around. Doesn't make much since to spend $400 on something that won't even upconvert. I viewed Saving Private Ryan on standard DVD on this unit and it made a marked improvement even over my other upconverting DVD player. Not phenomenal but VERY good. I have heard that other older and some new BD players were very slow starting (due to the amount of info on a BD ROM) but the S350 even in standard start-up mode will start a BD-ROM in about 45 seconds. The sound output from the S350 is also incredible! BD-ROMs sound amazing even on my older Sony surround receiver in standard 5.1 channel DTS. I can't wait to upgrade to a newer receiver with HDMI and DTS and Dolby HD sound!. If you are looking for a great player, this is the one! You will not be dissapointed! This is by far the best electronic purchase I have made since my Xbox 360!. 

$$;
Pros:. Price!!! Easy Hook up. 
Cons:. None so Far. 
Summary:. I could not find a Blu-Ray Player made by Sony for this Price!!! Period Im just glad I waited and didnt get hosed buying a player until the HD DVD Blu-Ray Battle was over. Thanks C-Net for the Wait and See you posted for several months on buying a player of any type.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture is simply spectacular. Unlike the earlier players, this one loads pretty quickly, 5 - 15 seconds on average. Quiet Operation. Light, small, and aethetically pleasing to the eye.. 
Cons:. no analog 5.1 audio out. but thats ok if you're using a newer receiver with a Hdmi in port.. 
Summary:. Bottom line this is an excellent player especially since its possible to get it for under $200 (got mine for $150) it loads movies w/o a glitch, plays them with ease, and the picture is awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to hook up and to use. movies look great. 
Cons:. i have a onkyo 6.1 and when i watched a dts hd5.1 master movie my theater system played it in a simulated 6.1.... thats ok cause the next blu ray movie i watched played normal dolby digital and crystal clear sound and video.. 
Summary:. loving it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy Setup. Excellent Picture Quality. Great Upconversion for Standard Def DVDs. Ethernet Connection. 2.0 Profile with Firmware update. 
Cons:. Lack of multi-channel analog output (not a big deal for some). 
Summary:. With the Holiday Season already here, finding this player for under $250 and even under $199 should not be a problem. For a so called "Entry Level" Blu Ray Player from Sony, this is a great choice for someone who is new to Blu Ray. Picture quality is incredible. I have a 60hz 1080p LCD Screen and with OTA and Satellite Broadcasts, motion blur is a big problem with Fast moving scenes and sports events. This is not the case with this player. Fast moving scenes did not produce any motion blur. Configuring the player on my network was very simple and the Firmware update took approx. 10 minutes to download and install. I'm using a 2 gb Flash drive for BD Live content and although the insert is recessed, a thin flash drive should fit easily. The player does lack DTS MA and 5/7.1 Analog output, but you'll probably end up paying the price of a PS3 with those features added.. Highly recommended.. 

$$;
Pros:. I paid 216.00 dollars for the player. EVERY THING this web site has stated about the 350 is true.. 
Cons:. None.for 2 hundred dollars it cant be beat. 
Summary:. I have the 350 hooked to my childrens tv in the family room. The samsung 52 inch 750 with touch of color. Bottom line picture looks great. Only better picture is with my samsung 58 inch 1080 p. The s350 looks alot better on the plasma though. Overall this unit cant be beat for the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good value unit that will satisfy all but the most critical videophiles. Easy to use standard features and plenty of tweak options.. 
Cons:. Some better units out there for handling standard DVDs.. 
Summary:. For entry machines this unit fits the bill. For those that want to hang onto old DVD's you may look at the Panasonic 35K unit, but I like the features on the Sony better and I am going full swing into Blu Ray.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. 
Cons:. need to hardwire player inot your network for update. 
Summary:. I really wish this player had a wireless option to it for getting updates and when it finally goes 2.0.. But this player is just what I wanted for a player and has everything I need to get a beautiful 1080i BD experience.. Not to complex to work and easy to setup and watch a movie in seconds.. With the rumor floating around that in September 2008 this player will drop $100, this will be a killer player to have at $299, but even at it's current price of $399 it is still a good, not fully great, but good, solid player.. 

$$;
Pros:. so simple to hook up. 
Cons:. havent found one yet. 
Summary:. ive been waiting, reading reviews &#38; when this came out i decided to pounce. love the picture, but what has most impressed me in the first few days is the sound. i have 5.1 dolby digital, so ive got great sound anyway. but this seems true surround, without hearing what speaker its coming from. great on upgrading standard dvds on my 42-inch, hdtv.. 

$$;
Pros:. tiny, quick, will support 2.0. 
Cons:. pricey still but with 2.0 profile, you can feel you're making a long term investment.. 
Summary:. Great player, works well, looks great...I chose this over the PS3 cuz it looks better in a home theatre and works with my harmony remote. For anyone that says DVD isn't that bad...watch a blu ray movie, then put in any DVD on the same tv.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good resolution and up-converting. Loads fast too.. 
Cons:. The menu's are hard to understand and navigate and for non-tech people, there's gonna be a problem. 
Summary:. I bought this player from Amazon on Black Friday for $198.00 with free shipping and no sales tax, so it was worth the price. Cheaper than I paid for my Toshiba A2 HD-DVD player (which I still use). 

$$;
Pros:. At $249.99, performs better than $600.00 Samsung BD-up5000. Using HDMI, the soundtracks of my stereo came alive with bluray discs. The DTS decoding apparently works wonders with my Pioneer Elite receiver--the sound is awesome. Small size fits closet.. 
Cons:. There is one abstract feature I wish it had. I have an old conventional DVD player (Pioneer DVD-F727) that will, on pressing the menu button, take you directly to the movie's home screen--skipping over all of the movie trailers and advertisements.. 
Summary:. Overall, this is an outstanding bluray/DVD player. It loads faster than my high-dollar Samsung, displays a better picture through HDMI, and produces a noticeably better sound through my system. As mentioned above, I wish it could somehow skip all of the junk at the begining of a DVD and go straight to the Movie's home screen. Since I receive about 6 movies in the mail each week through Block Buster rental, all of these seem to be front-loaded with movie trailers and advertisements--even fast-forwarding and chapter skipping takes several minutes to get to the movie's home screen. On my old Pioneer, It some how knows where the beginning of the movie is and jumps straight to it. I wish this player had that same feature for standard DVDs, and Blurays. I am certain when the bluray format is fully adopted with rental companies, it will also get stuffed full of advertising and trailers and it would be nice if it could skip them as well.. One other nice feature is the size footprint of this player. Being smaller than standard "rack" size, they fit comfortably on small shelves in media closets. Works so well, I bought two of these just for that purpose.. 

$$;
Pros:. Crystal picture. Amazing sound. Easy to use remote. Size is perfect.. Small about the size of any DVD player.. 
Cons:. Does not play DVD-R. Still a little spending at 300 bucks.. 
Summary:. The features on this player are great. They are very straight forward. No huge remote with a bunch of buttons to learn. The picture is just as good as any I have seen in the store. Sound quality is excellent. I like the size too very compact. You can even access the menu while watching the movie without stopping it. Firmware will be out soon and it is supposed to have some extras you can do online including updating it to 2.0 instead of 1.0.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great performance and price. 
Cons:. Some battery life issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just about everything is great.. 
Cons:. NO SLOW MOTION! NO SINGLE FRAME ADVANCE!!. 
Summary:. Had I know about this, I would not have bought it. I don't think I read a review saying it was lacking in such a basic function.. 

$$;
Pros:. N/A Not tested. 
Cons:. N/A Not tested. 
Summary:. At Costco yesterday I saw this model but called BDP-BX for $379.00. Wondering why the name change.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to hook up, small package, excellent picture. 
Cons:. mine does locks up when showing pictures and need to take it in 1 day after purchases to fix this problem. 
Summary:. If the viewing of picture files (JPG) can be fix, it is a pretty good buy, but would think that MP3 playback should have been an option, so maybe with the forward upgrades Sony will fix that lacking issue.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent design, small size.. Excellent image and sound.. Easy setup and good graphics. 
Cons:. Hard to access the memory card.. Can't play frame by frame and slow motion.. Play Fwd and Rew in segments, not continuously.. 
Summary:. I bought it a month ago and I returned it. The reason: excellent image quality and sound, but if you try to play frame by frame or slow motion, forget it. I called Sony and they said that it doesn't have that feature. So the fwd or rew during play, you can't advance the movie faster viewing the all the sequences of the scenes, just in segments of seconds (10,15 etc) so is hard to search a specific part of a scene.. I think this technology is too young or the factories are stealing our money puting new features (new?) little by little so you have to buy a new model every year. Is bizarre that you can't play slow motion in 2009. There is no sense.. I read that the Panasonic Blu-ray is the only player that it has that features.. 

$$;
Pros:. too soon to tell - my first blu-ray and only had it 5 days. 
Cons:. No Mp3 playback of any kind.. 
Summary:. Main Point: In this day and age, can't we expect a reviewer to tell us if a unit that plays cds, dvds and blu-ray disks will NOT play any MP3 disk??? (Or anything else we might be used to having a dvd player do?). I checked for reviews here and other places before I bought this unit. No red flags, so I bought. If I had known no mp3 playback I might have bought the Panasonic DMP-BD30K which does play mp3s on CR-R/RW. So now I have to buy and connect a CD/DVD player that plays mp3's. That is unacceptable, Sony. You get a 2 of 10. (But as I submitted that review I now have a new format with 1-5 stars, so 1 star out of 5.). Point 2. Under original 005 firmware, my unit would not power on with original and two other remotes. Once on, all three remotes worked including power on and off. But after being off for 3+ hours, again the three remotes could not turn it on. Sony online chat guy was unaware of this as an "issue". Standard reset to default settings did not fix. FW 007 appears to have fixed this.. Point 3. On some screens playing DVD or blu-ray a screen hangs saying essentially: you can't do that. I say hangs cause the can't message is on too many seconds and you can't do anything else while it is up.. Point 4. On updating firmware on a disk instead of network cable. I could have used better directions on making an "image" file on a disk. Yeah, I know each burning software is different and I floundered through it with Nero, but Sony docs could have been better..

$$;
Pros:. Quiet, crisp picture, small size. 
Cons:. Terrible quality in workmanship, problems with software updates. 
Summary:. I purchased this Blu-ray player 14 months ago and also purchased a wireless adapter to have the ability to download current system software updates provided by Sony. After downloading the latest software update, my blu-ray player would no longer read blu-ray disks but would still play standard DVDs. I contacted technical support at which point they guided me through resetting my blu-ray player to factory settings. This didn't solve the problem. I was then told that it was a "service" issue and that I would be responsible for the cost of repair. I'm amazed that a Sony Level 2 tech support rep would have the audacity to make such a statement as if I would fall for the old "coincidental" problem that was NOT brought about by the software update. Long story short, I have purchased Sony products all of my life inclusive of computers, televisions, cameras and audio players. I will NEVER purchase another Sony product again given the lame excuse used by tech support that the problem encountered with my blu-ray dvd player was coincidental with the latest software update download. STAY AWAY FROM SONY PRODUCTS, in particular, the BDP-S350 dvd player!. 

$$;
Pros:. Not Much--the picture is good but so is all blu ray. 
Cons:. Constantly locks up. Audio plays but no video. The latest and greatest firmware has been applied. The remote control is cluttered.. 
Summary:. I bought this to play blu ray with my 1080p Samsung FP. Every time the video locks up I have to power down my TV as well to break the "any-lon" connectivity even when it is supposedly turned off. The latest firmware has been applied with no success. The remote control is clunky, not ergonomic in shape design, and the buttons are right on top of each other in the center circular control. I have to say lately every Sony product I have bought I have had to return. Hoepfully Best Buy will let me return this even though it is over six months old and let me upgrade to a Samsung. I have 5 Samsung FP's and other products and none have let me down. What happened to Sony quality?. 

$$;
Pros:. It's a stand alone Blu-ray player. 
Cons:. Too expensive for the feature set.. 
Summary:. Come on, it's time for a sub $200 Blu-ray player, at this price, most people should just go for the PS3. I think it's time for the reviewers to get really picky about these overpriced products. I understand that the PS3 is price subsidized, but Sony really needs to focus on making Blu-ray a better value. I spent less then $1000 on my HDTV, I'm certainly not going to spend $400 on an HD source..
