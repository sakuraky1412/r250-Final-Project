 it feels as easy to read as the k1 but doesn't seem any crisper to my eyes   .

 the white is really grey, and to avoid considerable eye, strain i had to refresh pages   every other page .

 the dream has always been a portable electronic device that could hold a ton of reading material, automate subscriptions and facilitate quick easy downloads, and be as portable, as easy on the eyes, and as intuitive as a book .

  they would ask, to which i would squint my eyes and reply,  huh ?

 i found that the kindle 2 is immediately appealing to the eye and once described in the barest of terms people want one for themselves .

 no having to turn away every few minutes to relax your eyes  or ending a session of reading with a headache .

,  e, ink and matte screen ,  no harsh computer, screen look to it does not fatigue my eyes at all, and the matte helps reduce glare from light bulbs and the sun .

 my eyesight is fine, but i can choose the font size that suits me best .

'easy, on, the, eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink :

 i noticed this almost immediately but thought it was due to my poor eyesight .

 i can read technical books without any problems but i cannot read text on the kindle without straining my eyes .

 i was starry eyed in anticipation of the newest addition to our family .

 the text clarity and screen sharpness of k2 is severely disappointing and produces eye fatigue .

 i had old favorites, and some classics that we're told we should read, samples that had caught my eye, and lots of new choices , ,  and i held them all in my hand .

i know i need to go to the optometrist, but the kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought .

 and with the kindle, i can adjust the font to any of six different sizes, which is of some importance to those with poor vision or tired eyes .

 the text is easy on my eyes .

 for me, it was no problem at all, no eye strain after reading for a few hours .

 i know some people are really upset about the no backlight issue, but i'm glad because it is not as straining on my eyes as a computer screen .

 i read for 2 hours in the middle of the night last night and my husband never knew, and my eyes didn't hurt .

 text to speech is adequate, i don't see myself using this feature too much, but it's a lot better than nothing when you need both hands free, and it would be a truly fantastic feature for anyone with poor eyesight or blindness .

,  the screen is easy on the eyes .

 the screen is amazing & the one thing that kept me from reading on into the night constantly eyestrain is no longer a concern !

 i don't care it doesn't have a backlight ,  if i wanted that i'd read from my laptop and kill my eyes more .

 this thing is so easy on the eyes, i like it better than an actual book .

0 out of 5 stars a great tool for those of us with aging eyes, february 28, 2009

 the text, bumped up two magnification levels, is sharp and clear enough for me to make out, and while i've seen some criticism of the gray page background, i actually find it easier on my eyes than stark white .

 for those of us in the boomer bulge whose eyesight is failing and taking with it the pleasure of reading ,  and for those with other forms of visual impairment ,  it's nothing less than a miracle .

 as advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .

 i am loving the whole concept and read almost a whole book last night with no eye strain at all .

i have been keeping an eye on the kindle since the first was brought out and did a lot of research on this product .

and that is why it's easy on the eyes and uses very little power .

 i use that as well when it gets late and my eyes tire .

 the lights are casted from the side of the reader fusing towards the center, which caused me to experience severe eye, strain .

 even without the back light, within fifteen minutes of reading on the sony reader due to the glare, my eyes were hurting .

  i have not experienced eye, strain .

 the illuminence of the light is equally distributed onto the screen which causes  no  eye strain .

 using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .

 and reading on the kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !

first of all, the kindle 2 is very easy on the eyes .

some have said they don't like the black text on a greyish background, but i find the contrast not only more than adequate but easier on the eyes than if the background were white .

 a backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .

 i won't be using the feature much anyway because i get a lot more out of a book i'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .

 it's easier on the eyes not to have that light .

 it's also easy to make the font larger whenever necessary, like when my eyes are tired .

 e, ink hardly strains your eyes .

 truly, this helps in my eyes .

 easy on the eyes, font size can be changed and the book will even read to you if you want it too !

 not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .

 with the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .

 this means you can read for longer periods of time without eyestrain .

 the screen is so easy on the eyes .

 the kindle does not have a screen that taxes the eyes, and allows me to shift some of my time away from the computer for blogs that i would normally read online .

 it's lightweight and allows changes in font size that enables ease of reading no matter how tired your eyes may get .

i do think the e, ink e, paper is a lot easier on my eyes for reading than the glossy or matte computer screens .

 the screen size is close enough to the size of a paperback book page that it hasn't caused my eyes any problems .

 it looks very much like a book and is easy on the eyes .

8 e, ink display is easy to read and doesn't strain your eyes and reads better than a printed page .

 i can strain to read the text but then close my eye for awhile and listen .

,  eye strain is completely non, existant in my experience .

 i would like to read on the way but my eyes get strained if i read on a bus .

 it is also very easy on the eyes .

i can make the font the perfect size for my eyes .

 although i'm turning pages quicker, my eyes are much less tired by using a bigger font .

the screen is less obtrusive than the white of a book page, which also helps my eyes from growing tired too quickly .

i finally got the kindle, and my worries about the screen tiring my eyes while reading rapidly dissipated .

 it's easy on the eyes   and easy to hold .

i am 71 years old and read at least one or two books per week and this reader is easy on the eyes .

 searching for books and downloading them is fast and easy, the screen is very easy on the eyes .

 unfortunately my wife lost about 50 percent of her eyesight ten years ago and has not been able to enjoy reading since then .

 adding one for  free  to the kindle2 is just pulling wool over your eyes .

 as it gets latei simply pump up the character size which eases tired eyes .

 now with the kindle 2, i can change the print to suit my eyes and further, i can make more intelligent choices of books because i have more information of what is available at my finger tips .

 i am amazed at how easy the e ink is on the eyes, the slight shadowing from page to page does not bother me .

 the screen is easy on the eyes, easy to learn, easy to turn pages, and the device is more comfortable than a real book or trying to hold the iphone .

 the print is easy on the eye and the light weight of the device and easy to use controls make reading even more of a joy !

 the text, to, speech function is great for times when my hands and eyes busy with other tasks .

 i have an  eye issue  and noticed it was getting harder to read books .

 i enjoy having the text at the largest size because there is less eyestrain .

 the e ink is so comfortable on the eyes .
