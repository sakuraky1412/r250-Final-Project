 only things i wish they added is measuring distance [not just steps] on the pedometer, better sound on the speaker, and a  capturing still images  with the video recording feature .

 the gym music drowns out the sound .

 the headphone jack is bad out of the box, sound crackles with the lightest touch of the headphone jack which makes the radio useless because they use the headphone cable as the antenna .

 turn the volume up and the sound in the headphone lowers, turn the volume down and the sound goes up .

 video is impressive, speaker sound is good for size, easy menus, screen is big enough to watch movies .

 the 5th gen nano has improved on the 4th gen in a few ways, mainly in sound quality .

 the nano is definitely several notches above the sound

 i don't particularly use it with headphones although the sound is

no way to balance sound between ear pieces .

 sound in one side is significantly higher than the other side .

 i have used the video camera nd the sound is good considering and the picture is
