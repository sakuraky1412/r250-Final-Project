_________________________ update__________________________

> links up flawlessly to my mac using garmin roadtrip, webupdates, etc .

the maps seem to be fairly updated .

,  speed of map updates is awesome .

easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .

more often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .

the map update was about 2gb in size .

it's a curiousity for most of us, traffic and content updates   .

this clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .

update and reroute much _more_ quickly than my other gps   .
