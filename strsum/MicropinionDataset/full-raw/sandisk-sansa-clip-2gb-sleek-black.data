i is looking for an mp3 player to use on my commute to work on my bike  .
i did not want to pay a lot for something that plays videos , who watches videos on a screen that small anyway  .
i watch videos on my computer or tv  .
imagine that watching videos on tv  .
i wanted something small that just playes mp3 files  .
i rip files in mp3 format and have no clue if the thing works on other types  .
i also do not use the fm part  .
i just know this thing works great playing mp3 and sounds good  .
it clips on to my clothing and stays there  .
i can also put it in a pocket  .
i like the lock switch that locks the buttons so it can do well in a pocket without having stuff get paused or stopping the music  .
it charges easy with a std mini usb cord  .
i keep one at work and one at home and after about 2 weeks of riding back and forth to work i plug it in and it is good for another few weeks  .
the battery gauge is pretty good and does not suddenly drop like my digital camera and cell phone do .
love it so much , i've recommended this to friends who have also purchased it .
i've had this mp3 player for a few weeks and love it  .
i have an ipod nano and i bought this mainly for the fm radio (a $50 add    on with an ipod) and for its small size to use while working out  .
it sounds better than my nano  .
i wish i could find where to buy the bundled earbuds  .
i'd buy a couple of other pairs because they are the best i've come across (and i have purchased several in addition to the ones that came with my players) this mp3 player is one of the real gems in audio available .
the sound is exceptional  .
i continue to amazed by the audiophile sound quality for a device that is purchased for around $50  .
to me it is remarkable given the size  .
it powers my grado sr60's beyond any reasonable expectation  .
also have the sennheiser hd600 headphones , and again is amazed by the sound that is reproduced i  .
, clarity , imaging , air around the instruments , etc  .
this is truely a sonic gem  .
should also note , it has a great battery life .
i wo not buy anything else .
picked up a refurb of one of these for under $20 and it seems to be a tremendous deal for what i got  .
compared to an ipod shuffle this blows it out of the water with a great user interface and features  .
even at full price this would be a great deal (pay more for the assurance that it'll work out of the box  .
heh) absolutely no regrets for purchasing this  .
i had a creative mu vo before that is ok but i is always rotating out the aaa battery  .
with the sansa clip , the mini    usb connector charges the built in lithium    ion battery being hooked on podcasts , i  .
ve been using it for an hour or two daily for the past 6 or 7 months without any problems .
i've owned mine for over a year and during that year i've sweat all over this thing and dropped it numerous times  .
it still performs like brand new and the battery life is still really good  .
for what i payed for it i could not be happier with this product  .
when it's time to upgrade i will purchase another sandisk product .
this is a great little device  .
i needed a small radio to use while walking the dog , and this is way better both size    wise and reception    wise than the sony armband radio i is using , plus it has a 2g mp3 player to put audiobooks on for our walks as well  .
i is concerned about reception due to other reviews , but i do have to say that it is totally sufficient and setting station presets is supereasy  .
with the clip feature , i may prefer this over my ipod nano  .
this is a very good mp3 player and the low cost makes it a great value too  .
i mated this to a pair of v    moda headphones for a great sounding system .
i got one over the samsung yp series which is like $25 more definitely a great buy  .
sound quality is amazing you totally need to buy a good set of headphones to experience the sound quality the ones it comes with are sorry like most packaged headsets are this one is worthy of a good set easy to use no drivers needed ro propriatary software just plug and play  .
havent tried the rhapsody , but who does anyways  .
lol  .
i recomend it .
i bought the sansa 2gb clip to use primarily at the gym because it had an fm tuner i could use to get tv audio  .
bought at best buy for $35 on sale which is a steal  .
sound is impressive (cannot tell much difference from my ipod) and it's a luxury to have a display on a player this small  .
it's flash    based so dragging and dropping files is a little more cumbersome than using itunes , but it has not bothered me much  .
at 2gb i think it's excellent value while on vacation , i accidentally had the player in the pocket of my swim trunks in the pool for about 5 minutes before realizing what i'd done  .
i let it dry for a few days , and it is totally unresponsive , but then i plugged it in to my computer to see if the memory is fried (this is probably stupid) and it fired right up as though nothing ever happened  .
i is shocked but ecstatic  .
probably would have bought another one , even at $60 .
after losing my ipod nano a few months ago i'd been in the search of a replacement , but had not found a worthy replacement (i don't like the new nano)  .
when i saw it in a store , the sansa clip immediately caught my attention  .
it looks great , it's small enough to take it with you to the gym , the sound is great and it's very easy to use  .
the design is very user friendly  .
something that i didn't like at first is the headphones jack on the side , but after connecting my shure earphones i realized that it actually works better given my earphone's l shaped plug (that way the cord does not bend)  .
i'm suscribed to rhapsody and this player is very easy to set up with the service (pretty much plug and play) which for me is another big plus  .
i started transferring music immediately without any problems fm reception is a little poor , but it's very easy to setup (i wish my car stereo is that easy) and fm and voice recording are just icing on the cake using the player is very easy  .
it's menus are well organized  .
the screen is very bright , even during the day my only beef is that it only comes with 2mb  .
i wish they made a 4 or 8mb version , even if it is a little more expensive .
first thing you'll notice of course is the small size and cute look    if a couple big sansas had a baby , this is probably what it would look like the weight is nice and light  .
disappears into a pocket for running or gym  .
the built    in belt clip is a nice option if you don't have (or want to use) a pants or shirt pocket the standard usb mini    b connector is nice    so you can use the same cable as your digicam , etc  .
everybody's got at least a few of them around the house these days when first connecting , my pc had trouble to recognize it  .
an easy , free call to sandisk support quickly identified the problem of not having an updated windows media player usability is pretty good  .
the 5 buttons ( select in the middle , and 4 directions on the circular pad) are pretty good , but not as nice as the sansa e260  .
the volume rocker on the side is not bad , but that's one of the best features that i miss from the wheel (you learn to nudge the wheel to adjust the volume , without looking , no matter what orientation of your e260  .
i have not tried the radio or recording or rhapsody sound quality is great    clear and very low noise  .
definitely a step above the e260  .
the 5    band custom equalizer is very useful    not quite as handy as the 7    band on the e , but still allows a fine level of adjustment  .
this alone blows away anything from apple  .
enjoy  .
this is indeed a better , more fully featured device than the shuffle (screen , fm)  .
the clip's sound quality is better than both my fourth    gen ipod and my older sansa  .
(note   i have high quality earbuds so i can tell  .
the only demerits are fm reception that occasionally breaks up (a little more than my previous sansa , but not crippling) and the battery , which is internal and can only be recharged at a usb port  .
that's less convenient for me than putting in new aaas , but probably better for the planet .
i got mine for $35 at the bestbuy after thanksgiving sale  .
you cannot beat that  .
i have rhapsody to go and a zen vision   m and the sound quality easily equals that (in case you do not know creative players are renowned for good sound) so basically i am now using this now more than my main mp3 player  .
i am really enjoying this little thing  .
( also the blue glow on the black is perfect even if it is overused)  .
this is really a fantastic player  .
i've listened to several mp3 players and this little guy can put out some serious sound  .
it sounds a lot better than the ipod shuffle which is it's main competitor  .
it also has a host of features that the shuffle does not have  .
wrapped nicely in a package for $59 this is without a doubt the best player on the market for gym use  .
it's incredibly light , has a built in clip , and is fully featured  .
it lacks video but really if you want to watch video you should get a psp my only quip is that the headphone jack is positioned very close to the volume adjustment  .
if the end of the mini stereo plug is a right angle , it can cover the volume lever unless you flip it around so it points up like an antenna .
i have a 30 gig zune for the car , but wanted something small for the gym  .
i can play mp3's on my phone , but don't like to carry that when i'm lifting weights or doing cardio  .
saw this unit at best buy (black) and bought the 2 gig for $60 bucks  .
no addl software is needed the device drivers are automatically installed and then windows media player recognizes it and can be used to sync or create play lists  .
the quality is great and it's very easy to operate  .
the headphones included are not the best , but it's that way with any mp3 player  .
i have a ton of better earbuds lying around so that was not a problem  .
the interface is easy to operate and the sound is great , but one of the things i love is being able to clip it onto my shirt or shorts without buying another $20 case  .
it's only  .
9 ounces so it doesn't feel like there is anything weighing me down  .
my wife does not like complicated technology and loved mine so much we picked one up yesterday for her (the red one)  .
it took about 10 minutes to plug the usb sync cable to the laptop and select the music to sync and it is ready to use  .
also as a small bonus it came with a partial charge  .
i'd recommend this whole heartedly  .
the only thing i think could be better is if it could have more memory , but for what i'm using it for it's already got plenty of room to spare .
have had many mp3 players including this brand  .
the sandisk clip (2gb) has great design , layout , sounds and controls  .
2gb is adequate for me (and hopefully for you) in a player this size  .
the built    in 'clip' on the player is great in that you do not need a case to place it on a belt or pocket  .
the menu on the oled screen is great , on music you can search by artist or title  .
only fault is the built in battery  .
my sandisk clip ran me $49 bucks , and with a built    in battery will it be worth my while and cost to have it replaced at the end of the battery's life or to 'trash' the player  .
sandisk should print this on the packaging  .
other than that , a great mp3 player  .
updated  .
on jun 21 , 2010  .
i like this player  .
i is always frustrated with the previous ones i owned  .
everytime i tried to listen while doing any moving around  .
the ear bud wires would tighten and pull out of my ear  .
i would end up putting the player away  .
the sansa clip is perfect for me  .
because of it's light weight i can clip it on the adjuster band on the back of my hat  .
i can play a full round of golf and they stay put  .
also the player is so small that very few people even notice it  .
this eliminates my frustraton  .
i'm very happy with the player  .
the first night i had it , i charged it and down loaded 175 songs  .
which did not quite use half of the memory thats alot of music  .
outstanding sound from such an inexpensive unit  .
highly recommended .
i bought three sansa clips (blue , black , and red) at best buy last black friday  .
i only got it for $35 so it is a good deal  .
but i was not really expecting much from the player  .
i loaded the player with  .
wma files (@96 kbps)  .
then i tried it , using the earbuds that came with the package , and is unimpressed  .
but the sound is still decent enough  .
however , i is blown away by the sound when i used a different earbud (a skullcandy smokin'buds)  .
it's also very easy to use  .
even my parents , who are not tech savvy , were using it after i taught them how just once .
i is looking for a small flash based device to use primarily for running  .
my first choice is the creative stone , but before i could buy it i heard about the sansa clip and decided to check it out  .
at first my mind is still set on the creative stone or the stone plus on account of creative's well earned reputation for audio quality and to be honest i didn't think the sansa clip would match up to well in that area  .
however the review by jasmine france persuaded me to give the clip a try and so far i'm very pleased with it  .
originally i planned to use it mainly for running and any other activities that could damage the hard drive of my creative vision m  .
but i enjoy the clip so much that i use it most of the time when i want to listen to music and while the vision m definitely sounds better than the clip the clip is just so small , light , handy and out of the way while still sounding great  .
the ability to record radio is a nice feature to have and its not found on many mp3 players especially one this small  .
the included earbuds are not so great  .
i've tried several others in the fifteen to thirtyfive dollar range all of which were better than the stock earbuds , but the ones i like the best are the creative ep    480 and the v    moda bass freq earphones  .
the philips she5910 also sounded nice and can be found for fifteen dollars , but if you do not mind paying quite a bit more , the clip is worthy of earbuds in the hundred dollar plus range .
i bought this player as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend  .
got 1 for myself to check out , since it is on sale for $34 at bestbuy  .
so far a week's use and wish i'd gotten 2 more  .
set    up is about average , pc wise , but user interface is great , sound is great , value for money cannot be beat  .
i own a video ipod , and sad to say that this little wonder will be getting more of my time .
i've had the sansa clip for a few weeks now  .
i bought it because of the review on this site and it is spot on  .
the sound is great , holds almost 1000 songs if you use 64kbps wma , and seems pretty durable  .
i like that i can use my phone charger to charge the player since they both use miniusb  .
i use it everyday at work and when i go running it stays in place  .
radio kinda sucks but if i wanted to listen to the radio , i would not have bought an mp3 player  .
anyone looking for a cheap but solid mp3 player should seriously look into buying this , i like it even more than my ipod shuffle .
i have been looking for one of these since they were announced  .
i am in the market for a new one since my gym mp3 player , the creative m200 does not have a very good fm radio  .
i gave my little igb sandisk away and now i realize it had better radio reception than the creative  .
on the sandisk website , they now have the manual and it says the battery for the clip can not be replaced  .
i wonder how big a deal that is  .
i have had my m200 for at least a couple of years and the aaa batteries work fine  .
is the clip trash when the battery dies  .
maybe that is ok if it lasts long enough  .
i still want one because of its size and because it has a screen and fm i know a lot of you get angry when someone rates without purchasing , but there is no other way to post here  .
i will change my rating as needed thx  .
i have returned this item 3 times because i cannot get the battery to last more than 6 hours  .
i have recharged it from empty to full each time and it only lasts about 6 hours  .
i mainly use it for the radio morning shows and i get 4 hours one day and 2 hours the next day  .
if you try to charge it before it runs out it won't charge  .
it's my favorite mp3 player but i just hate this battery  .
i got a replacement contract for when it goes out  .
when you look at the specs they wo not tell you what kind of battery it is .
we have several sansa's in the house first experanince with mp3 player 2 gig 250 series battery great and after a year still working well son swiped it so i bumped up to this player a 2 gig sansa clip new from sansa store  .
this unit would not hold a charge and within a few weeks freezing  .
after talking with customer support downloading firm ware went back as returned  .
next i went with a 2 gig expandable slot  .
this one as well had issues went back at this point using my 1 gig sansa which is still working well if i tried again i would go with 2 gig battery one and not worry about charging it up i haven't tried other brands simply because use to this one my consern is quality controll seems to be a hit and a miss  .
i just could not imagine paying more then 50 + for the hit and miss we experainced with this brand  .
but when it is working as intended it is wonderful  .
liked it , loved it , but it died  .
cheap and not worth it .
i guess i won't by sansa or scandisk products again  .
at least not without some research  .
there's a lot of overhead in learning product features and then the return process  .
i can see why some reviewers loved it    there's did not breakdown  .
but a number of others had problems like mine and their ratings were low .
after buying this and having it fail , i did some research  .
alot of people are having them fail got an ipod nano and i am much happier  .
sounds great .
my sansa clip started acting funny after only 5 days  .
it suddenly started duplicating every fm radio recording  .
then it would not turn on and off sometimes  .
i had another sandisk sansa , which i paid about $150 for , and that one also stopped working properly  .
although my old sandisk sansa lasted for about 1  .
5 years , i still see this brand as being very cheap and unreliable .
i bought the unit via dell and they refused to replace because unit is more than 21 days from invoice date  .
make sure if you purchase , do it from a reputable dealer with a reasonal return policy  .
i will never buy another dell product  .
cannot use sansa with windows media or any other music player  .
the proprietary software is seriously flawed  .
cannot find songs , cannot transfer audio files sansa provides very poor and outdated support  .
i am not referring to talking to someone , that is impossible  .
i am referring the info they provide with the unit and online  .
it is totally inadequate and not close to current with latest version of clip , which i have .
