i stayed here with friends when attending a wedding .
the hotel itself is on the main road which runs up the east side of lake garda , and as such has fabulous views from the `` lake view '' rooms .
it also has a good swimming pool with a few loungers and a hammock perfect for reading that book you 've never quite managed to start !
there are a few parking spaces out the front , and we never struggled to find a space , if you did there is ample parking on surrounding side roads .
rooms were clean and comfortable , although take note there are towels but no soap , shampoo etc so do n't forget to pack yours !
there is also no air conditioning , which means the ceiling fan is very welcome !
it hit 40 degrees when we stayed , so we had the balcony doors open all night .
be aware that the lake view rooms are also road-side , and you will hear traffic at all hours of the night , so light sleepers may wish to choose a room to the rear of the hotel .
breakfast was a good selection of cereal , different breads , meat , cheese , fresh fruit and yoghurt .
the hosts are hospitable and welcoming , and the pizza restaurant next door ( where you get a 10 % discount ) is worth a visit .
it is a 10 minute stroll to malcesine town centre , which is lovely and full of bars , good restaurants , plenty of ice-cream outlets and shopping . . .

even better is the fact that from hotel room to being submerged in the lake takes no more than 5 minutes !
for the cost , hotel casa popi is highly recommended.
