we were pleasantly suprised when we arrived at teh salvo as it was a fairly 'cheap ' option compared to others in shanghai .
location is great and our room overlooked the bund , great view .
room ; its very traditional in its design lots of dark wood and gold , very nice , our room had a big bathroom with a corner bath andf great shower , hairdryer was nice and powerful as well ( normally a problem for me with having long hair to dry ) each room has a desk and sofa and chairs , 2 tvs , computer with free internet which is an excellent resource .
hotel : concierge very heplful with luggage , taxis , directions etc and speak quite good english .
business centre in there were we booked train tickets , commission was a lot and you could def get cheaper but we just found it convenient. .
girl in there was pretty rude though .
december seems to be time for renovations in china as yet again there was work going on and some banging/noise .
then on the 2nd of 3 nights they made us move rooms which i was not happy at all but they did upgrade us .
( i wouldnt recommend payong for an upgrade , not much difference at all , just couple more freebies and a table and chairs ) location great , you can easlily walk to the bund area or taxis are very cheap .
shopping is great at the markets leave room in your case !

m on the bund fabulous restuarant you must go , western food , but very very good , reasonably priced ( Â£21 for 3 course meal on new years day ) and the concierge can not do enough for you , service was impeccable.
