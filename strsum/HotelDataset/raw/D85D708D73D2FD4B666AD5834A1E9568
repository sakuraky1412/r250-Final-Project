the check in staff and generally all staff were helpful and professional and would always respond to questions with some enthusiasm and detail .
having booked a standard room we opted to upgrade to the executive floors for $ 40 per night per room this included several benefits most notably access to the lounge for evening cocktails/appetisers and refreshments throughout the day .
this upgrade also included breakfast for the rooms occupants ( 2 persons ) in my opinion this was great value if you make use of these benefits !
we actually preferred the breakfast downstairs but if you want a less busy breakfast it 's fine to have breakfast in the executive lounge .
one reason why we booked this property was it 's proximity to the sites of which included ben tanh market which was a 5 minute stroll .
it is also located near to the backpackers area which was handy when booking excursions/tours .
the other major attractions are a 10 minute or so walk away .
the room was neutrally decorated with a huge comfortable bed !
it had a city view and while it was the level expected in a 5* hotel i could n't help but think it lacked the wow factor of other 5* hotels we have frequented .
despite being an executive room it did not have wireless connectivity but did have wired access ( no use for an ipad !
) you can access wifi in the executive lounge which was handy .
overall we would consider . . .

overall we would consider staying here again if the rate was right but would probably end up trying out the caravelle which also looked like it was well located .
