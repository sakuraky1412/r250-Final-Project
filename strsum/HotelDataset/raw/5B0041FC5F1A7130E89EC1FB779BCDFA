we have visited florida a few times but never stayed in a disney hotel .
this hotel is lovely but pricey , however , if you want subtle disney grandeur then this is the place to go .
we had a standard family room which was good enough ( two doubles and a big bathroom ) for the amount of time we spent in the room .
we ate in the inventions restaurant for breakfast which was a lovely buffet but make sure it is included in your room rate as it 's about 60 euros per adult .
my top tip would be to use café fantasia for late night cocktails or nightcaps .
it 's around 16 euro 's a cocktail but you could be in a lovely cocktail bar anywhere , you do n't feel like you are slap bang in the middle of a disney resort .
hotel location is perfect and a 5 minute walk from the train station , no need to get the shuttle .
it 's also about 5 mins to the entry of both parks .
the hotel has a gym with modern life fitness machines and also a running map with a 4k route which is quite a nice run .
the pool is indoor but really nice although as you would expect it 's pretty busy with kids the majority of the time .
the pool doors open out onto a grassed area which have layout chairs for sunbathing .
check-in and out was super smooth and we stored our bags with . . .
