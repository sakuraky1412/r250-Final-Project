hilton garden inn is located a bit away from the city center next to business park vienna .
the hotel does provide a complimentary shuttle bus throughout the day ( with varying frequencies depending on time of the day ) between business park ( about 1 minute walk from the hotel ) to vienna state opera .
the 2 main reasons we chose this hotel was that 1 ) we could use the shuttle to get to the city center and then walk to most of tourist attractions or use public transport once we were in the city 2 ) very low points needed for the hotel especially for points + cash awards ( 10,000 hilton honors points per night or 3,000 hilton honors points + 32 euro per night ) .
there was no walk-in shower but rather bathtub + shower .
the bathtub was pretty high to get in and it seriously felt like an accident waiting to happen ! !
we had booked 2 rooms for 4 of us and both my wife and i have hilton gold and so all of us got complimentary breakfast .
we had the breakfast both days in garden restaurant .
there was an ok selection of bread , juice , cereal , egg , meat for the breakfast buffet .
there was also an omelette station which my parents always love .
thumbs up : easy transportation to city center with complimentary shuttle with half hour frequency in morning and evening and hourly during noon .
decent breakfast spread at the garden restaurant lots . . .
