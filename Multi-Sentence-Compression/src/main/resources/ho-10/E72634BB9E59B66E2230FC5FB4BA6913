we stayed in chongqing for a couple of nights and think this place was one of the best hostels we stayed in on our 7 month tour of asia ( south korea , china , india and se asia ) .
it 's a pleasant 15mins walk to and from the city centre up some old narrow steps , through the backsteps of an old town area ( if that has lasted , given the pace of redevelopment i .
when we left they even gave us as note of the hostel number and said that if we needed any assistance anywhere in china we should feel free to give them a call .
we found it easy to reach from the nearest metro station because it was all downhill , but that made leaving chongqing a bit harder going back uphill so i would suggest getting a cab .
it 's also well located for the riverfront tourist area and the cable car rides which cross the river ( also worth doing to explore the other side a bit ) .
there is a cool bar / restaurant area at the front of the hostel which is a good place for meeting fellow travellers .
yes there was a huge bridge being built across the river , but that also made for an interesting site .
get a bottle of the local chinese red wine from the bar : it 's pretty good !
each bunk also had a full length curtain so you could literally cocoon yourself away from the world at night .
the staff here were friendly , but one girl in particular was fantastic help and spoke excellent english .
