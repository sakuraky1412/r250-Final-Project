i stayed in this hotel because of the good reviews on tripadvisor but have found my experience a little at odds with other reviewers .
i agree it represents great value for a town that is , with all respect , intent on squeezing as much of your tourist pounds out of your pocket !
the place is spotless but very basic , i would liken it to a hostel or an ibis style hotel .
it 's two stories , with no lift .
the room is big enough , with two 'beds'- wooded plinth with upholstered springs so its a firm sleep .
the walls are also very thin and it 's was less than pleasurable waking up each morning to screaming kids running up and down the corridor and arguing russian couples .
the bathroom is a hole in the wall , toilet and sink is fine- shower is a nozzle on the wall and a hole in the floor .
ladies on reception are friendly with good english-been glared at a few times by the housekeeping staff and the manager who do n't seem to want to say hello .
whilst i keep a low profile on holiday , i have found the service a little indifferent .
the hotel seem popular with coach parties and breakfast can be frantic interms of finding somewhere to sit and feeling like you are sat in a wacky warehouse- breakfast includes eggs , roast potatoes , toast , yoghurt , cake , coffee , juice , herrings and salad !
there is also cake and coffee . . .

there is also cake and coffee available throughout the day which is a nice touch when you return from trips .
no kettle into but you can borrow one from receptionrecommended if you are on a tight budget but if you can spend a little more , i would go somewhere else for a better nights sleep.
