i bought this unit in january of 2009 as a refurbished unit from amazon  .
it arrived in a plain box and i is pleasantly surprised that it appeared new in all aspects  .
the unit is simply amazing  .
i can not express my satisfaction any other way  .
i will never go back to paper maps again  .
some people say the unit will send you on a wild goose chase or take you on a route way out of the way  .
well , when you are in a totally strange place where you have no idea where you are or how to get to your destination , this unit will be your best friend  .
want gas , food , lodging  .
just input your desires and it will tell you what is available in your area , the address and will even guide you there from your present location  .
most people who are critical on it's accuracy , or say it sends them the wrong way , must be in a familiar area  .
if you are in a familiar area , by all means , go your way  .
if there is someone else in the car with you , the two of you may disagree on a route too  .
it will get you there i love the bluetooth connectivity with the cell phone , it doubles as a handsfree speakerphone  .
are gps's perfect  .
no , they are not perfect and probably never will be , but they do what they were designed to do extremely well  .
once you get to learn to use the device , it's strong points , and weak points , i think it will be the best investment you can make  .
i would not leave home without it if i am going to an unfamiliar place  .
would i buy this unit again  .
in a heartbeat  .
i believe garmin is the best unit out there  .
as with all high tech toys they become obs in a few momths  .
the traffic reports are great i live in a area that is not covered , but it gives reports is areas i am going to  .
will renew it  .
keeps the battery full charged in the car , as the 660 didnt  .
did not come with the case and home ac charger as the 660 did  .
overall i am very pleased with the unit .
leaves me speechless  .
the best navigation system out there to be brief and to the point    spectacular no flaws  .
never by a magellan    breaks to easily .
i have had the garmin nuvi 5000 for a few weeks now and it is the best  .
it picks up a gps signal in 1 or 2 seconds  .
msn direct is great  .
directions are the best i have send in a gps  .
maps out a route very fast  .
excellant map coverage of the u  .
and canada  .
do not waste your money on the nuvi 760 , get the nuvi 5000  .
it is so much better  .
i use it in my 2007 chevrolet malibu  .
the garmin nuvi 5000 is not to big or to small for this car  .
it is just right  .
so i wanted to update the reviews  .
my c330 crashed and won't load the maps  .
the 760 continues to power up and display the maps  .
i do not see a reason to buy at 1490t just because it's there .
love this unit  .
the navigation is as good as i've see (although , i haven't seen that many of them)  .
easy to use and as accurate as you can expect (the routes are not always 100% the best way , but that's subjective , i guess) it'd be even better if when you put in a route , it could give you a couple different choices  .
my friend had a cobra gps unit that did that and i really liked that capability on a side note , the bluetooth function works well  .
the mic is phenomenal  .
it's really sensitive (although , probably not windows    down friendly)  .
the only gripe about that part is i wish that it would split    screen when you're on a call  .
and you could easily manipulate the volume which leads me to my other wish  .
i wish there were dedicated buttons  .
i like the clean look and feel  .
but i wish there were dedicated buttons for volume up and down and maybe a home function  .
i hate having to back out of multiple menus after changing some in    depth setting or searching for something but , those are just wishful thinking  .
it's definitely a great unit , in my opinion  .
works like a champ  .
i do not not claim to be some kind of expert on gps systems , but i did very extensive research for about a month and if you are reading this , then you are probably like me in that regard  .
i travel a great deal for business to multiple states and cities every week (i really use this thing as it is intended) and this device is an absolute joy to use and operate  .
it seems with the nuvi 760 (700 series)garmin has truly produced an absolutely fantastic piece of technology  .
the features are too many to list , but my favorites are    .
clear and very well pronounced voice prompts for street names up to 500 waypoints bluetooth phone (i don't use this however because my car has it built in)  .
great where am i feature  .
car locater (automatic)  .
mp3/audio book player  .
qwerty or abc keyboard  .
high sensitivity receiver  .
auto recalculation of routes  .
speed limit display  .
internal antenna (no flip up like 600 series)  .
fm transmitter (works fine in newer cars with integrated antennas , more on that later)  .
beautiful bright (much brighter than 200 series) and colorful display  .
preloaded maps  .
downloadable maps and pois  .
built in memory as well as sd card slot  .
handles 10 routes  .
fm traffic compatible  .
msn direct compatible  .
trip log (up to 10 , 000 points)  .
and this does not cover nearly all it is capable of i read some reviews that criticize the strength of the fm transmitter  .
i have had absolutely no problems at all with this feature , and i use it in many different cities in multiple states  .
however my vehicle is a 2007 infiniti g35 , so i have integrated radio antennas that are very strong so that may be why  .
if you have an older more traditional external antenna it may be weak  .
i do wish it came with a plug for charging in the home (the 600 series did) , however the usb connector for your computer does charge the device so not a huge issue and you can purchase the ac adapter in most electronic stores that sell garmin  .
internal antenna gives it a very clean look when mounted  .
mounting options are excellent , suction is extremely strong and works perfectly , a small black disc comes included that mounts to the dash and you can put the suction cup downward on the disc  .
i live in phoenix arizona and the adhesive for the disc is very secure and has been unaffected by the summer heat (and it doesn't get any hotter than phoenix in the summer period  .
this is how mine is mounted , with the power cord running back down behind the dash (no wire hanging) i had the installer connect it internally so my cig lighter is free and it looks clean and classy  .
it turns on and off with the car  .
also the wire for power is connected to the base (not the device) so you can just pop it off and take it with you without disconnecting any wires and using the internal lithium battery (approx 5 plus hours)  .
no carrying case is included but they are cheap to pick up  .
the only real advantage the 800 series has is voice recognition , witch i hear works very well , but i doubt i would use it much , not to mention you can get a 760 right now for under $500 or even less online , the 860 is at least $900 online ($1000 in stores) and the only real difference is the voice recognition  .
my car has voice recognition for its phone and other features and trust me , it's overrated and gets old  .
for its current price it is truly a fantastic value  .
get it and i assure you it will meet your expectations and more  .
do not let the know    it    all reviewers scare you away , it works great all the time and is absolutely loaded with features  .
it's easy to use and works fast and accurate  .
needless to say at this point , i love it and am so happy with my purchase  .
money very well spent  .
excellent product , impressed since this is my first gps 1  .
very easy to set up (including setting up bluetooth fm transmitter) and use 2  .
clarity of voice is excellent  .
voice exit prompts are quite accurate whenever u get close to the street u r about to exit 4  .
the 3d visual display is excellent , not too bad even when there is glare from sunlight 5  .
re    routing calculations when u miss the exit , is very quick 6  .
touch screen is very receptive  .
may take a few extra secs to catch up with the satellite signal (generally abt 8 secs on avg , but sometimes has taken to about a minute which is irritating when u r already on the road) 2  .
using bluetooth , there is some static and also when the fm transmitter is tuned to ur car radio system verdict   all in all , especially for a first time user , excellent product , certainly recommend buying it  .
my wife and i have been using garmin c320 gps in each of our cars since 2005  .
it is time for an upgrade  .
i purchased the garmin nuvi 760 and we love it  .
here is a little overview about how i decided what to get and some of the key features we had to have my must haves in the new gps were text to speech , traffic , bluetooth , no flip out antenna , and a 4  .
3 screen i did a lot of research on magellan , tomtom and garmin models meeting my must haves  .
my conclusions were as follows   the magellan incorporates aaa and that i feel is a really nice touch  .
the tomtoms come pretty loaded but seem a bit more complex  .
the garmins interface hasnt changed form the c320 but garmin has added a slew of additional features in comparison to my c320 since the new gps wasnt only for me but for my wife , i decided to keep the learning curve to a minimum and decided i would choose another garmin model since we are both experienced with them  .
now , which one  .
i looked at all nuvi units  .
i narrowed my choices down to the 255w , 760 , and 780  .
each of these include 4  .
3 screens , text to speech , bluetooth , no flip out antenna , and are traffic ready  .
the 255w does not include either the fm tmc traffic or the msn direct power adapter  .
the 760 includes the fm tmc traffic power adapter while the 780 includes the msn direct power adapter when i started to check pricing i is noticing that the 255w is the same price as the 760 but did not include any traffic power adapter  .
i also noticed the 255w power is connected directly to the unit  .
more on this in a moment  .
i decided it is off my short list and my choice is now between the 760 and the 780  .
i decided on the 760 since the price is more that 100 dollars cheaper then the 780  .
i can always ad the msn direct power adapter later and i will have the fm tmc traffic power adapter as well another reason i decided against the 255w is that the power is connected directly into the unit and not the mount  .
it is so much easier to remove the unit from the mount and not have to worry about disconnecting the power cord as well  .
convenience is another key factor i should have mentioned the first thing i did once i got the 760 is register it at the garmin web site  .
once i did i is able to update the units software and maps  .
garmin has a web updater software download on their web site  .
connect the 760 via the supplied usb cable and run the web updater software  .
the software will check for the latest version of system firmware/software and update the 760  .
that worked very well i might add the 760 came with 2008 maps but the 2009 map update is available via garmins web site  .
if you buy the 760 now you can call to get the 2009 maps free if it does not come with them  .
garmin uses navteq maps and from what i have read , are more accurate for the usa  .
the web site is telling me to buy them but i made a quick phone call to garmin and verified my purchase via email with one of their support staff  .
a few minutes later i is able to either download or get a dvd with the 2009 maps  .
the dvd is $10 and that is for shipping  .
i opted for the download  .
the 2009 map file is large , around 2 gigabytes so it took about 20 minutes to download via my cable modem  .
once downloaded i ran the setup and it updated my 760 to the 2009 maps  .
it is pretty easy but including the download it took about an hour  .
i also created a dvd with the 2009 map file for safe keeping  .
the map is the complete north america maps  .
on the c320 the maps had to be uploaded and not all of the usa would fit  .
the 760 is fully loaded with the usa and canada  .
very nice  .
while i is online i looked at the garmin extras available for download and decided to add a few new vehicles  .
pretty cool once i finished updating the 760 i took it to my car and mounted it  .
the mount is just a couple of pieces and the 760 mounts securely in seconds  .
the power cable connects to the mount and not the unit so that the unit can be removed from the mount easily with no wires to disconnect  .
the mounting is excellent  .
i also purchased the optional portable friction mount which sits on the dash  .
i highly recommend this so that you can easily hide the 760 , mount and all , on the cars floor  .
very easy as compared to the supplied suction cup mount and doesnt leave that suction cup ring on the windshield  .
seems thieves love to smash and grab navigation units so the friction mount is great as it leaves no evidence visible you have a 760 in the car i am amazed at how quickly the 760 acquires satellites  .
when i did the software/firmware update it installed sirf star iii quick fix  .
this allows the 760 to acquire satellites very quickly  .
so far every time the unit has been off to powered on it has acquired satellites as soon as it is booted up  .
total time from off to ready to navigate is about 30 seconds the nuvi 760 has a beautiful , bright , and crisp looking 4  .
3 display  .
the fonts have been updated and the graphics are much better than my c320  .
i really like the new automatic zoom in and out based on distance to the next turn and destination  .
you can see the destination checkered flag and via point flags are orange  .
a nice touch is that your personal addresses display on the map the 760 speaks street names text to speech  .
nice feature instead of turn right in 200 feet  .
there is no maneuver ding like on the c320 but im not sure it is needed with the additional spoken information the 760 includes bluetooth so i is able to pair the wifes phone in about a minute  .
really simple  .
the phone book from the phone transfers to the 760 along with recently dialed , recently received , and recent missed calls  .
very cool  .
once you start populating the 760 with your favorite destination addresses you can manually add phone numbers to your favorite addresses if needed  .
this is very nice since you can touch the favorite you want and touch the little phone icon and dial that number  .
you can talk hands free via your 760 and i is pretty happy with the voice quality  .
i read a few instances where people say it doesnt work well or sound good  .
this isnt the case for us as i find it to work very well and sound really good  .
a valuable and convenient feature  .
on our first trip together we needed a certain item and we were able to pull up stores we thought would have it and simply touched the phone icon and called them to see if they carried what we needed  .
once we found the store that had what we needed we were able to easily navigate to it  .
very convenient and easy to use  .
i recommend the 760 with bluetooth  .
very nice searching for any of the included 6 million points of interests is easy and the poi search displays names and addresses in the results  .
the additional address is a nice touch to see just how far away a result is if you know the town and how far away it is from you  .
the keyboard can be set to qwerty and that makes typing so much easier if you are familiar with a pc keyboard  .
and who isnt now a days  .
another nice feature is there is a drop down that will allow you to access and insert recent searches without having to retype them since they are remembered by the 760  .
another nice feature another very nice feature is you can create multiple destinations and have them automatically sorted for the optimal route  .
you can keep adding stops or via points and you can even remove them  .
you can manually reorder them to your liking or let the 760 automatically reorder the best route for you  .
great if you need to run some errands at two or three different stores  .
the 760 will get you to each in the most efficient way the 760 has a where am i feature that is very nice  .
it will show you hospitals , fuel , and police stations that are near to where you are at  .
it will also indicate the nearest address and nearest intersection  .
this is great to see just where you are and can be provided to law enforcement in an emergency or to tell someone exactly where you are in an unknown area  .
your elevation is also indicated as you drive there is an icon that will display the speed limit for the road you are on  .
a little reminder to check your speed and keep it safe maybe on of the best features are the real time traffic updates  .
the 760 comes with the fm traffic power adapter  .
the traffic adapter is in place of a regular power adapter so the only thing different is it is it has some leds and it is a little larger where it gets plugged into the cars power  .
of course you need to be in an area that is covered by fm traffic  .
if you are in a covered area than it can take about 10 minutes to get traffic data  .
once data is in the 760 it will display on the map and on a separate traffic screen  .
one bad thing is once power is lost so is the traffic data  .
it may take another 10 minutes or so the acquire traffic data again  .
traffic issues are displayed on the main map screen with different colors and an appropriate traffic icon on your route as you approach them  .
an icon in the lower right will also show you how much time traffic is causing your delay  .
this time is automatically added to your current route  .
if the traffic is deemed too much then the 760 will recalculate a new route almost seamlessly to divert you around the traffic  .
there is plenty of traffic related detail on a separate screen if you want to access it  .
you can also touch the avoid or detour to force the 760 to reroute around traffic  .
the included fm traffic comes with a 3 months free trial then it is $60  .
00 per year  .
worth it if you are on the road a lot and your travels are within the covered areas i think i am going to get the msn direct (separate power adapter) after the 3 month trial expires  .
the msn direct includes traffic , gasoline prices , and weather alerts  .
there is more to msn direct but these features make it more worth it to me  .
another nice thing about the msn direct is that you can opt for a one time lifetime payment and youre done these are all the features for us that make the 760 a really nice gps unit  .
there are many pluses and only a few drawbacks  .
two drawbacks are ; no house ac adapter and no carry case for storage  .
but , if you have a usb cell phone then you can probably use your ac charger for the phone as i do i recommend the garmin portable friction mount for the dash  .
easy to put in place and hide on the cars floor  .
i also recommend getting the garmin carry case i is able to shop the web and find the 760 for about $350  .
the portable friction mount and the carry case were another $50  .
so for about $400  .
00 i got a very nice navigation unit  .
for us the 760 is a wonderful gps  .
it is beautiful and sleek  .
the features it includes are a valuable addition and make traveling even short distances easier and more enjoyable  .
i highly recommend the 760 to anyone looking for a new personal gps unit .
this is the first gps i purchased for my car and after reading many reviews and articles (http  //www  .
gpsmagazine  .
com is a great resource) , researching the functionality and playing with many different models at circuit city , i'm very satisfied with this selection first the good points 1  .
) garmin is a large and well established company , so there is no fear of it going out of business any time soon and losing support  .
and since they've been at this for years , they know what they're doing  .
also , this unit seems durable , reliable and the software is not quirky ; hopefully this will prove true over time  .
)this model has a very accurate and fast routing engine , which is the primary reason i've purchased it  .
the tomtom go 910 is the second choice , but it's known for being more accurate in europe 3  .
) the look and feal of the touch screen is great ; it has just the right sensitivity so that slight pressure activates the selections  .
and the choices react quickly  .
) there are many options that are intuitive to get to , but the basic needs (getting to a place on the fly although i think this is dangerous for any unit unless you practice dividing your attention)are very easy to activate  .
) this unit has the best mounting system i've played with  .
it's very fast to dock and undock from the cradle with one hand  .
this is important for security reasons 6  .
)once docked , the unit automatically turns on , boots up quickly (~15 seconds even from a cold boot)and begins looking for satellites  .
acquisition time is fast (~5    10 seconds in an open area)  .
)the point of interest database is vast  .
you navigate to the menu screen and can quickly find the nearest gas stations , hospitals and police station (this the where am i feature)  .
all the stores , restaurants and other areas i am familiar with are recognized and are shown as a menu  .
when you see what you want , just touch it and a giant go button appears  .
touch this and a route is calculated ; usually in about 5 seconds  .
then the unit prompts you on how to get there (using voice or not) 8  .
) there are several ways that this route is shown to you  .
a 3d view , an overhead map view , an overhead map view with an visual instruction and a visual instruction list  .
these views are very similar to how websites such as mapquest display instructions  .
it is also fast to switch between the displays 9  .
) the estimated time of arrival is amazingly accurate +/    1 minute from areas about 1/2 hour from my destination 10  .
) when you miss a turn and the unit recognizes this (~5 seconds depending on your speed) , a route to get you back on track is automatically re    calculated  .
many times this is a bypass route , not just a default u    turn to get you back to where you messed up  .
although it has done that if that the best route 11  .
) finally the price is right  .
as of this writing , most places have a price in the $450    $600 range , but if you search the internet , wait for deals , or are a e    bay'er , you can get a much better price  .
at $384 from buydig  .
com this is competitive to the tomtom and the magellan  .
high price is usually one of the bad points with garmin devices now for some of the bad points  .
this kept me from giving this device a perfect 10  .
) voice quality  .
although the 760 has a huge selection of voices , accents and languages , if you select the tts (text to speech option to actually pronounce streets and points of interest and for fast speed while driving)they all sound like relatives of steven hawking  .
this is where the tomtom shines , it had the smoothest and most pleasant voices 2  .
) downloads from garmin take forever hours even with a dsl connection  .
but this is actually more of an annoyance  .
) the fm transmitter is not that strong to overcome the static  .
it's acceptable , but i know this could be better 4  .
) this unit came bundled with a tmc real time traffic reciever and 3 month free subscription  .
this is a good thing since a  .
) the receiver , which is combined with the cigarette lighter adapter , is incredibly expensive (~$200  .
)if you buy it sepately and b  .
) i'm not going to renew the subsciption since the inrix database that tmc uses has not been accurate at all shows bumper to bumper traffic in areas that are clear sailing  .
i will try the msn system , which uses navteq (the same one traffic  .
com uses which is more accurate xm traffic is supposed to be the most accurate and garmin units do use this , but the garmin 760 doesn't appear to be compatible with it , oh well)  .
the msn receiver costs about $120 , which is not great , but i'll deal with it  .
and since you can get more info (weather , gas prices , etc  .
)it should be more useful  .
we'll see 5  .
) finally , and this is just me nit    picking , the animation is a little jerky  .
it would be nice if it were smooth and continuous  .
i'm sure future units will probably have this  .
also , the garmin 860 is out , that uses voice commands  .
that would be nice , but for another $500 , i do not think so other than that , the this is a great device , and i easily recommend this to prospective buyers .
great and easy to use , quick route calculation and recalculating fm transmitter not great very staticky no matter what frequency i tuned it to bluetooth compability is fantastic  .
another top line product form garmin .
i bought a lowrance 250 last year but did more research this year and settled on this system  .
using the route planner with the lowrance is a nightmare and you had to keep setting stops and re    adjusting to keep you on track as it would take you hundreds of miles out of your way , off the highway and back on again which made no sense with the nuvi 760 , you just add the starting point and ending points and it takes you right there or allows you to add the least amount points with ease if you want to adjust your route  .
even while traveling you just hit the detour key and it gives you another quick routing option  .
if you go off course , it quickly responds to this and re    adjust the route to get you back on track while lowrance got all confused some of the poi's are old and outdated , along with the speed limit box while traveling on the interstates but these are minor flaws  .
with garmin's poi handler you can download from their website , it's very easy to add your own poi's or download others from a host of websites  .
you can even set the alerts and distance to let you know if your approaching a rest area , or say your favorite restuarant chain my system is new out of the box but did not come with a more detailed owners manual  .
i ran into a slight problem that i couldn't figure out , since i didn't have a manual so i e    mailed customer support late in the afternoon  .
they responded to my e    mail within 8 hours having read everyone's horror stories about dealing with tom tom's customer support , that is a high consideration in making up my mind to go with garmin and they proved me right with their quick response my one suggestion to garmin is to design the system that we can customize which categories we want to use first when we push the menu or tools icons so we do not have to scroll around while driving  .
other than that , i am very happy with this product and recomend it highly .
after taking a lot of research , i found this product very satisfying and a pleasure to play with  .
i need a lot of things in it  .
compact enough for a shirt pocket  .
i bought a same carrying case for 9 dollars at circuit city .
i needed a new gps after my lowrance iway 500c just died on me (it is a gift so i am not crying about the lost that much)  .
let me tell you do not buy an iway 500c  .
it is a piece of crap  .
in july , 2007 i bought the tomtom go 720 for my wife  .
i wanted a gps for myself and after having my lowrance iway 500c stop working on me i did some shopping for another gps  .
i came across the garmin nuvi 5000  .
wow , this unit has a huge 5  .
2 inch screen but is so light and thin  .
if you like garmin products but want a bigger screen then this is it  .
it has the latest maps , pois , and features already install and ready to go  .
the routes (directions) are perfect every time unlike the iway 500c  .
go to www  .
garmin  .
com and read up on this bad boy  .
it is worth ever dime that it is selling for  .
all gpss have their pros and cons  .
none of them are perfect  .
what i like and dislike about the garmin nuvi 5000 and the tomtom go 720 are the following    .
likes (garmin nuvi 5000)    .
) nice , bright , big screen  .
) directions are accurate  .
) speaks the street names often and clearly  .
) great pois database (maybe the best i have seen in a gps)  .
) msn direct    excellent  .
(traffic , move times , weather , local events , gas prices , news , and stocks    wow  .
) great looking maps  .
i think people are jealous when they ride by me and see my gps or may be they want to steal it    i dont know  .
) gps is very light and non    bulky for its size dislikes (garmin nuvi 5000)    .
) routing and re    routing calculations are not as fast as the tomtom go 720  .
it needs to be a little faster for my taste , because it can be a little bit slow likes (tomtom go 720)    .
) fast routing and re    routing (the fastest i have ever seen in a gps) 2  .
) very easy to pick alternate routs 3  .
) good to some what great directions , but sometimes screwy 4  .
) mapshare  .
dislikes (tomtom go 720)    .
) terrble mount  .
i had to buy a 3rd    party mount because the one that it came with it didnt hold the gps well  .
the gps kept falling off the windshield 2  .
) the screen washes out to much in bright sunlight 3  .
) though the go 720 speaks the street names , but it doesnt speak them as often or clearly as the garmin nuvi 5000 4  .
) the screen could be bigger for my taste 5  .
) traffic capability is expensive and the coverage is not as big as the msn direct with garmin 6  .
) no move times , weather , local events , gas prices , news , and stocks features like the garmin nuvi 5000 with msn direct so you make your choice , but what ever you do dont buy the lowrance iway 500c  .
5 out of 5 fantastic stress    reducer monday , january 21 , 2008  .
addictedtogarmin from nyc and upstate ny  .
i love this unit  .
this is my first gps and i read tons of reviews to choose one  .
i went back and forth between this and the tomtom 910t but this one won  .
i wish i had the tomtom voice control destination entry option (the only negative on this unit is having to enter the addresses) , but this unit keeps the past addresses , so its really easy to access them once entered  .
i have it set to daniel , the brit , and we have our arguments (its nice to have a navigating verbal companion)  .
daniel , although insistent about turning at times will readjust and offer me a new path  .
he offers me options along the way and always warns of turns in plenty of time  .
he tells me about a turn way in advance , tells me how long i will travel on this road , and then reminds me of the turn right before the turn  .
he even tells you which lane the exit will be in  .
so all the turns and exits are relaxed  .
the turn is also listened in advance at the top of the screen in large type (along with useful things such as the speed limit and time)  .
you can just enjoy the ride without navigating  .
i travel backroads in the dark (with mapquest i is reading my papers while driving    not good  .
) the routes chosen are excellent and the unit readjusts immediately if you missed the turn or you are taking another path  .
its not turn    around    you    idiot he (or the unit) offers the next idea and turn  .
i'm so impressed and addicted  .
cannot go anywhere without it  .
widescreen display , bluetooth hands free calling , live traffic reporting  .
like the piano black color .
i purchased the nuvi 760 as a replacement for my nuvi 350 (which i loved)  .
purchase price of $750  .
00 out the door at bestbuy california  .
right off the bat you will notice the screen/graphical improvements  .
furthermore , it's route calculation abilities (  .
the most important feature in a navigation device  .
) are leaps ahead of anything else out there  .
whats more , garmin continues to provide the best user interface for portable/car gps systems (until apple joins the party)  .
for those that fell the speaker is too weak , use the built in fm transmitter or the mini stereo jack .
had this setup , installed , phone connected , and in use in about 15 minutes  .
the manual is really not needed if you have used a garmin before  .
my only experience with a garmin is in a rental car the maps are not 100% , but i have not looked into an update yet  .
originally ordered a nuvi 660 from tigergps , but cancelled when they never shipped or had it in stock when they claim they did  .
ordered the 760 from west marine , a quality outfit the bluetooth connection is very very good , sounds better than the speaker phone on my lg cell phone  .
connection is easy the fm transmitter works ok , but of course ties up the radio  .
over all i am very pleased with it .
all in all , i'm very impressed with this unit  .
i have been looking out for it for several months now and is on the fence between this model and the nuvi 680 which is also an excellent piece of equipment  .
i like how the antenna is integrated into the design of the unit  .
i have noticed no downside to this as i have always had quick connects to gps signals  .
the screen is bright and easy to see in sunlight  .
this unit along with other garmin units , has as easy learning curve when it comes to figuring out it's many options and settings  .
i live in the houston area and the msn direct features work great  .
i had some reservations about it , but after kicking the tires on the program for awhile , it has givin me correct gas prices and for the most part has beem very accurate to traffic updates  .
now , i live just outside the houston area and it still shows full bars on msn's own meter for reception  .
now , this unit didn't come with the msn direct receiver/power cord rather then it came with the fm traffic alone version instead which also seem to gather information with ease  .
i is able to attain the msn direct power cord/antenna for a reasonable cost although these things are expensive accessories  .
i found it a very worthwhile expense  .
i just wish they had one power cord that had both fm traffic/msn direct in one  .
having to bring 2 cords around is a hassle , but what can you do  .
now the style of the unit in my opinion is improved over the ever ageing style of the former 300/600 series nuvis  .
they have 2 case styles of this unit  .
it comes in a standard matte black front and back and sides in matalic gray at most locations you will find on the internet or local area vendors  .
now , best buy carries the unit in a full black high gloss version that i got  .
i just prefer the look and in no way takes away from the other style or performance of the other unit  .
on the road the device has been very accurate and has an option to offer a great amount of details as you pan out on the screen to maintain maximum amount of data with area streets etc  .
i love details and the only drawback to that settings is the redraw of the maps as it moves is slowed down sligtly but hardly noticeable unless you are looking for it  .
i like driving on the main highways and it shows the current speed limits posted on the unit  .
there is so much good i could say about this unit , but others have all ready made their comments so i wo not repeat  .
i will say that for an all in one unit it contains many features , some i will use and some i may never not  .
but , it's nice to have all those features there regardless for those moments when you just never know  .
i rank this unit on personal usage and open mindeness when scoring it so others out there wanting fair minded reviews can make their own judgement  .
it's just an incredible piece of hardware .
had my 760 a few weeks and first observations  .
my screen is really bright and i like it  .
no problem seeing it even at night  .
seems brighter than the 680 2  .
the mount seems improved also  .
locks the nuvi on better and has a quick release button  .
easy to use 3  .
signal is great  .
mine picks in 15    20 seconds after i turn it on  .
it is between 11    17 feet accuracy 4  .
love to be able to sort routes , that is what i bought it for and it works great so far 5  .
the voices are good but the speaker is smaller than the 680 so they are not quite as loud but still very good 6  .
re    routes quickly when you go offtrack 7 road lock does not seem to be a problem , have not run in to that scenario yet 8  .
really like it being thinner than the 680  .
put them side    by    side in best buy tonight and you could really tell  .
fits in my pocket better  .
best buys 760 unit is solid glossy black , mine i like better it is matt black nice finish with a silver stripe in the middle  .
my cellphone works better and people and understand what i am saying clearly  .
had a problem with this on the 680 really glad so far that i updated from the 680  .
traffic works fine with the cable provided but i bought an msn cable as i prefer the msn  .
also i emailed garmin about a mapsource cd and they emailed back its on the way to you free .
after a disasterous experience with the mio c520 (returned) , the garmin 760 is welcome relief  .
it is easy to use and it works  .
my only complaint is that it likes to send me on major highways when i know they are not the best route  .
the returned mio 520 is good at the back roads , but had some show stopper deficiencies  .
the garmin 760 wants me to return to the preferred route a bit too long after i take the back roads  .
but it figures it out after a while  .
the configuration choices for the 760 are fastest and shortest , but the freeways are not the fastest as one might expect  .
for areas where the user is clueless , the garmin would be a great tool  .
i have no major complaints .
i travel a lot and having a navigation unit mounted in the middle of my dashboard does not do me a lot of good when my car is parked at the airport  .
this nuvi 760 is replacing my nuvi 350 , as i wanted bluetooth i've had it about a week now and no complaints  .
the bluetooth is a snap to set up with my motorola razor , it even downloade all the telephone numbers automatically  .
the fm transmitter is great and easy to operate and the sound of your cellphone or audio through you car speakers is really great  .
the lack if an antenna sticking out the back is a nice improvement they have also improved the suction cup window mount , much better that the one that came with my nuvi 350 , this one stay put  .
start    up seems much faster and the wide screen is nice other than the larger screen reduces battery life my will run about 4  .
5 hrs with the brightness at 50% , but since it's usually used in the car and hooked up to the 12v battery life is not an issue  .
lots of new and easy to use features  .
i continue to look at other mfg's to find a better gps unit but you just cannot beat garmin quality and support  .
this is my 7th gps of one sort or another and it's so far the best yet but nothing rate a 10  .
i purchased this unit after a very disappointing experience with the tomtom 720 , which couldn't even locate my 1978    vintage house and suggested some odd routes (see my tomtom 720 review)  .
the garmin nuvi 760 found my house , suggested eactly the routes i usually take on my test trips and does so much more very , very well the interface in general is very easy    the go to interface has 6 million points of interest  .
it had every restaurant that came to mind for my look    up test  .
some rather new  .
wow the screen is very crisp and clear  .
the bluetooth is no problem to set up with my blackberry 8703e (sprint) and now all the points of interest are that much more useful with phone numbers / call options for each it has great setting features    like being able to go from an abc key layout to qwerty , or selecting from an automobile , bicycle , or pedestrian mode    very handy it also adds a great direct where am i feature that gives your position at the touch of a button and then lists all the emergency service links (police , fire , hospital) on the side (you can also see those through the poi list) it had multi    segment trip ability and simulated gps run through of a route    so it takes you through a route as if you were driving it , when you're really just at the kitchen table okay , so great features that so far seem to be executed well , but i do not want those to take away from what really impressed me about the unit the most   very accurate and great routing    which after all are the key gps functions and ones which at least the other company i tried seemed to miss on .
i tried these brands , tomtom , magellan , lg , cobra , etc  .
great effort , but know prizes  .
customer support for these brands were ok to horrible  .
some tech help didnt even know they supported the model number i gave them  .
they would put me on hold and say they would have to locate a demo and work with me  .
when they came back on after being on hold for 20 minutes , they would say just go through the unit and give it some time (trial and error)  .
garmin on the other hand is always on the money  .
very professional and tech brilliant .
now the pros far out weight the cons , but yes , the gps died on me the 3rd time we used it , but i might have just gotten a lemon i e    mailed they're customer service and i must say they treated me really good , they were prompt to e    mail me back and they tried helping me out , directing me to find a solution , but nothing so he set me up to send it , i should be receiving it back soon so far that's the major complain ( well i have not really had the chance to review it anymore considering we only had it for three uses  .
) , but it is the first time i have heard of this happening to the nuvi 760 .
you can find more information here http  //my    affiliate    story  .
blogspot  .
com/  .
this is the third gps i've owned  .
the first is the nuvi 360 , then the new and very disappointing navigon 7200t , and finally the nuvi 760  .
the voice is clear , the poi database is massive , map readings are great (although i wish it had the lane assist)  .
no problem synching my nokia blue tooth phone with it the one irritant which the less expensive nuvi 360 did not present , is the fact that you cannot add info to an imported poi (waypoint)  .
in other words , if you type in an address , city , state , etc in the search for a place on mapsource , and then make a waypoint of it , then import it into the unit , it only imports the name  .
you cannot add the address , suite # , phone # , etc on the waypoint that is stored in your favorites in the unit i called garmin and they said that's just the way it is with this unit  .
i think it's disappointing to remove a nice feature like that , that is available on a less expensive model  .
otherwise , i like this unit very much , although nothing is perfect  .
i did take a trip to california from las vegas , and in certain neighborhoods , the unit took me through side streets and did deviate from a shorter route  .
it sometimes seemed to have a mind of its own , when taking me to a place i wanted to go to all in all , for the price i paid at costco ($249  .
99) , i cannot complain and i don  .
t see a need to upgrade to a more expensive unit which in all probabilities will have very few added features .
i is torn between the garmin nuvi 700 series and the tom    tom 720  .
in the end , a sale price of $349 over came the lack of an i    pod interface if it is not for the price , i might have opted for the 780 (for the msn) or waited a week or so for the voice recognition 800 series i like the display , it is bright enough on a sunny day to read (a recurrent complaint of the tom    toms) the route planning is great , we preplanned a few scenic drives through south dakota and it worked flawlessly  .
i already own an older garmin , which works great , but the added functions make the additional purchase worth it .
i would highly recommend this unit even over dash installed units  .
you cannot remove your in    dash unit and continue mapping your course while you walk in unfamiliar places reminds me of how i felt when i gave up my monster sized installed cellular phone in my vehicle for one that is compact and truly mobile  .
i guess i am giving away my age .
i tried to do my homework on portable gps systems before i bought my new system , the garmin nuvi 760  .
my previous system is the navman 4420  .
i bought the 4420 for 2 main reasons    1  .
it is a bluetooth enabled gps receiver ; and 2  .
it works with my hp ipaq rx3715  .
navman no longer sells or supports the separate 4420 gps receiver and software so i cannot get map updates ; time to change systems  .
my experience with the navman/ipaq combination system is okay i have owned the nuvi 760 for 2 weeks and have used it in the san francisco bay area , chicago and detroit locations i narrowed my search for a new gps using web reviews  .
the top products i considered were the tomtom 920 and the garmin nuvi 760  .
my selection of the nuvi 760 is heavily influenced from friends who raved about the nuvi 660  .
the nuvi 760 is mostly an updated version of the 660  .
nothing in this review is specific to my use of the tomtom since i do not have it and have not used it  .
there are several sites where you can compare features between the garmin and the tomtom such as http  //www  .
gpsreview  .
net/compare    gps/  .
gps  1214    1197 on the positive side    .
ease of use   the nuvi 760 is very easy to use  .
my old navman required me to start the 4420 , connect the 4420 with the ipaq via bluetooth , configure and use the smartst software for the ipaq  .
the nuvi760  .
well , just turn on the system  .
my first destination is to my home from the location where i bought the unit  .
i did not read the instructions to set up or to enter my destination  .
i just turned the unit on and used the where to function of the nuvi  .
(real men do not need instructions [or travel directions] ; or at least they do not admit it  .
) getting back home is easy , intuitive and accurate  .
i found this to be true of all of the locations i have used the unit to find start up   a gps receiver determines your position by collecting signals from geosynchronous satellites and triangulating your position from their signals  .
satellite acquisition time is about the same for the nuvi 760 compared to the navman 4420 ; roughly 5 seconds (warm start) to 45 seconds (cold start from a new area)  .
i prefer the navman satellite acquisition display , i can see the number of satellites (up to 12) i am receiving and their relative strength    green , yellow or red    good , fair , poor  .
the nuvi shows 6 bars for satellite reception ; also red , yellow , green , but as an overall indicator , not by individual satellite  .
not a big deal but different  .
actual satellite acquisition time is about the same for the two systems  .
note   acquisition time is much faster when standing still  .
if you are moving it seems to confuse the gps receiver finding locations   the nuvi clearly excels over navman here  .
the navman requires satellite acquisition before selecting a destination , the nuvi does not  .
this is a significant improvement if you are trying to set up a route inside your starting point before you leave  .
(note   the nuvi 760 has all of the north america maps ; the navman requires you have to have loaded the appropriate maps to rom memory    internal , or external sd cards)  .
smartst breaks many cities into subsections which the nuvi does not  .
the smartst system can be a very confusing method when trying to pick a destination location where you are not familiar with the location of the destination  .
the nuvi can readily find streets , poi (points of interest    like store names) and intersections from user input  .
you can also enter a few characters and have a list of possible candidates displayed for you to select  .
you can type location data using a user configurable abcdef or qwerty virtual keyboard  .
i have noticed that pois are not complete ; i do not know if this is because garmin requires a royalty to be included in their poi listings  .
i have a ups store near me that does not display when using ups as a search criterion and it has been there at least 6 years  .
not a major problem but a relevant observation  .
route calculation is quick and accurate map coverage   the nuvi 760 includes all north american maps    canada , us and mexico  .
the smartst software included only the us and canada and specific maps had to be loaded to my ipaq by state or province (or parts of states/provinces)  .
the tomtom boasts north america and europe  .
i do travel in europe on business so the nuvi 770 may have been a better choice since it includes north america and europe  .
i may have to buy the european maps  .
here the tomtom 920 may have an advantage since it includes the north america and european maps  .
i have used the garmin 760 north american maps in the sf bay area , chicago and detroit and found the maps to be quite good bluetooth   i wanted bluetooth connectivity to use my samsung blackjack cell phone with the unit  .
it works very well except transmitting voice from the nuvi  .
voice pickup of the nuvi is poor  .
this has been pointed out in several reviews  .
i cannot say if the tomtom works better  .
receiving and hearing calls is good enough  .
i may need to buy a voice receiver so the party i am calling can hear me better  .
this is a clear negative for the capabilities of the nuvi 760  .
still , adding the cell phone via bluetooth is easy  .
cell phone integration does not exist for the navman 4420 traffic problem reporting   the nuvi 760 includes a 90 day fm traffic information subscription  .
i have not found this not to be particularly useful except for reporting the travel time delay to be expected versus open road travel times  .
it does offer the ability to avoid road segments but only if the software can calculate an alternate route near where you are  .
this alternate route did not exist for my commute home from the sf bay area or on the trip to chicago ohares airport  .
i did get a delay estimate because of the heavy traffic which is marginally useful  .
this feature is only okay for me so i may or may not renew the subscription to the optional service ($60 per year) data storage   the nuvi 760 includes 2gb of rom storage and about 512mb is free out of the box  .
the storage can be used for additional maps  .
mp3 files , audio books , and other add    ons (like additional vehicle icons or commercial and user created poi files)  .
the tomtom 720 boasts 4gb of rom but i do not know how much is useable ; one review says 170mb is available on the tomtom  .
the navman smartst software allows sd card expansion for additional maps only not so positive    .
price   the nuvi 760 is more expensive than a lot of gps systems , including the tomtom 920  .
my best advice is to surf the internet for best pricing  .
i paid $599 for my unit ($20 more expensive than the cheapest web site but i got it same day from a local distributor)  .
the tomtom 920 tends to be less expensive turn navigation   one of the negatives of the nuvi is the distance from your turn when the voice directions tell you to turn  .
this is a valid issue ; however , i found the nuvi warns you several times as you approach a turn  .
i found that if you pay attention to the early warnings you are well prepared to take a turn even if you are right on the turn before the final turn notification carrying case   for $600 you would think garmin could include a protective carrying case ; it does not  .
while this is not a major issue it is an irritant to pay another $20 to get a cover to protect the unit when removing it from the car ac adapter   the nuvi does not include an ac charger  .
the unit has a built in lithium ion battery , a dc charger/adapter for the car (with fm traffic information receiver) , and a usb cable to attach the unit to your pc/laptop for data transfer and charging  .
(i am charging my nuvi using the usb cable as i prepare this review  .
) one thing i really like about the navman is the user replaceable aaa batteries  .
i know that sooner or later the non    replaceable battery in my nuvi will no longer hold a charge ; i will have to send the unit in for service and/or buy a new system  .
to me , user replaceable batteries should be standard overall   i would recommend the nuvi 760 to friends and family looking for a portable gps unit  .
i would say it is about an 8 on a 1 to 10 scale  .
if price is a major consideration , look at the garmin 660 as an alternative .
i went shopping for portable/mobile gps systems today (birthday gift for my wife) , and came home with a nuvi 660  .
then i started reading specs , reviews , etc i've decided to take the 660 back and wait for the 760 to become available for purchase  .
it seems to fix some of the shortcomings of the nuvi 660 ; for example , it will save up to 10 routes (the 660 will save none) , allow you to specify 'via' points , etc i'm presuming that performance otherwise will be on    par with the 660  .
i couldn't find anywhere , but hope that the in    car charger plugs directly into the gps device itself , and not into the suction    cup mount , as with the 660  .
either way , it wo not be a deal    breaker for me i also presume that the map data out of the box will be more current that the 660 .
overall , great unit  .
i is anti    gps for a while and finally decided to take the plunge  .
i like the extras on the unit (mp3 , bluetooth , fm transmitter)  .
a great unit for a very good price .
this is the first portable nav i have owned  .
overall , i think it's great  .
it is extremely easy to use  .
my main complaints are   (1) distance to location is not shown or available on the route screen , but is available in the trip screen , which is accessed by touching the arrival time button  .
(2) while it does get me there , it's not extremely accurate in pinpointing the location  .
for example , when i arrive at my home address , it will not always indicate arrival until i drive past it (no , i didn't forget where i live ; i just wanted to see when it knew i is there)  .
this may be because my screen is set to more detail as opposed to normal , but i haven't checked that theory out yet  .
i also like the bluetooth feature  .
i am heard clearly and can be heard clearly  .
unlike otherbluetooths i've used , including ones built into the car , it is very easy to mute the call (make it private) and otherwise manage the call  .
finally , i have the screen set to auto which adjusts the screen brightness and coloration automatically based on ambient light and find it changes at just the right time  .
finally , i don't know if this is a mistake or just the way it is , but mine did not come with an woner's manual , although it did have the quick start pamphlet  .
i downloaded the manual , which is no problem except i now have an 8  .
5 x 11 booklet in my glovebox , instead of a more normal    sized manual  .
plus , the manual wrongly described how to reach the recalibration screen (which i ultimately used          unsuccessfully          to fix the location problem noted above  .
bottom line , of all the navs i've owned (and the only portable) , i would rate it my second favorite , after only the nav that is in my 2005 infiniti m35x (which had integrated voice commands , a bigger screen and a few other fun features  .
i had a 660 and it quit , i replaced it with the 760  .
with the 660 i got an ac adapter , leather case , more amenities the 760 remembers what state you're in when trying to find a place to go .
i have been a garmin supporter for along time  .
i am coming from a feature packed 2820 and i have had to sacrifice a lot of features going to the nuvi  .
i am going to start off with the negative first    .
i had a lot of issues with the bluetooth version 3  .
0 with my blackberry with disconnects  .
i called garmin and they had me downgrade the bluetooth software and now it works great i also live in houston and i used custom avoidances on my 2820  .
what is nice about that feature is a could tell the unit to never take me a certain way  .
this is useful because certain roads look great on a map but are a pain to drive i am also getting used to not having a remote  .
if i is on a call i used to be able to just push volume up on my remote  .
now i have to reach over and go into the menu i use my gps for work and personal  .
having categories in your favorite folder is useful for me  .
i had a work folder and a personal folder  .
so when i want to go somewhere with the wife i do not have to sort through 100's of doctors my last gripe has to do with the handsfree operation  .
while on a call and you are following a route there is no longer a ding to let you know that a turn is coming up  .
i have already missed a ton of turns because i am in sles and live on the phone between going to doctors' offices  .
also the speaker is weak and tinny when you bump up the volume  .
if you are on a highway you have to be at 80% or above for it to be a comfortable conversation  .
i will be hardwireing my audio out to my car radio as a result of the poor performance now for the good , traffic alerts work well  .
the screen is bright and very readable  .
the vehicle icons are cool and you can download more  .
you can run a mic to the cradle base for better sound while on a call  .
the size of the unit is great .
i purchased a couple to replace our zumo 550 and c330  .
this units seems much more sluggish than our previous units  .
the zumo had similar features and seemed to perform well but got rid of my bike so didn't need a water proof unit  .
possibly this unit has a slower processor and just does not perform as well with all the features  .
pretty dissappointed with these units based on cost , would like to upgrade to lifetime maps and traffic but not sure they are worth putting another $200 each into them  .
i is really surprised at the poor performance from garmin based on past experience and garmin reputation .
this is my first gps unit , and i is very excited when i received it  .
it had all the features i wanted in a gps large screen , bluetooth for hands    free cell    phone use , an mp3 player with an sd slot for my music , and an fm transmitter so i could listen to my music collection using my car stereo my first 2 trips were to staples for a memory card  .
it made me drive about a mile past staples and then backtrack  .
i then left staples for a doctor's appointment , which i is late for , because i decided to forego taking my usual route and follow the gps unit , which took me off an exit before the one i always take , and taking me down some tiny backroad  .
on the way , i made a phone call using the bluetooth feature but i just had to hang up with the person , because i couldn't hear anything they said  .
the volume is all the way up , the windows were up , and the stereo is off , and they said it sounded like i is on the highway with the windows down when i finally called them back and just used my phone later tonight , i loaded my new sd card up with music for another trip out of town  .
the fm transmitter is pretty much worthless it sounds like all my mp3's are being played on a distant fm station with lots of static  .
i kept changing the frequency , hopping up and down the options , and nothing sounded good  .
and this is all in a 10    mile trip in a suburban area  .
but this trip actually took me the usual way i go , and brought me right back to my house  .
i chose to set the machine for the shorter route , instead of the faster route , which is what i used earlier in the day the faster route took much longer and made me late , so i guessed the shorter route must be faster than the faster route reverse    logic at work  .
all in all , i guess this could be handy if i'm going somewhere i'm not familiar with , because i wo not know that it's taking me on a more circuitous journey to my destination  .
this machine for me is overkill lots of features that work very poorly  .
i will just have to live with this one (it is a gift) , or try to return it for a much cheaper machine that just does directions well and that's it  .
no music , no bluetooth  .
i is really excited about this , thinking this is the perfect gps unit , with everything i wanted in a machine  .
well not so much .
nuvi 760 could have much better voices and volume  .
tomtom has excelent voices and volume and you don't need your fm radio to enhace them  .
you get fm and you cannot listen to your radio do not get me wrong garmin , in general , are much better than tomtom , but in the area of voices tomtom gets 5 stars and garmin 2 , at most .
i guess i'll keep it  .
heard horror stories about others  .
really prefer wife's mdx nav  .
much nicer view and logic  .
oh well  .
in order to use bean bag mentioned as accessory , bought garmin brand beanbag at fry's electronics store , would not fit parts supplied with my 760 had to go to walmart to buy a garmin beanbag that worked .
i purchased a nuvi 760 yesterday  .
if you like downloading routes into your gps from your computer this is not the unit for you  .
routes must be built in the unit and this is not very easy and in some cases seems impossible the 760 will not download gpx files from your computer or mapsource as routes  .
it will only down load gpx's as custom points of interest (poi's)  .
you then have to select each poi and try to re    build that route in the unit  .
this is very difficult and time consuming , with a lot of menu layers and button pushing between the list of poi's and the route pages further , the poi's are re    ordered    from the gpx route's original sequence    to list them in order of proximity from your current position (from closest to farthest)  .
so , it is impossible to see what the gpx's routing is originally  .
this makes any attemt to order the poi's like the gpx's route impossible as an example , after downloading a gpx tour of the 17 mile drive of monteray , ca , i had to move each poi to hand build a route in the unit  .
but , even after allowing the unit to do its cool new feature and optimize the route , the unit planed a route helter    skelter through pebble beach golf course and not on the leasurely , logical costal site    seeing tour like the original gpx's route is built a quick check of the user's manual and gpx's are not mentioned another problem is garmin does not send a cd copy of city navigator north america nt 2008 in the box so you can put it on your computer  .
silly really you bought the license agreement to city navigator north america nt 2008 when you bought and powered    up the nuvi 760 i really hope garmin is not going to ask people to buy the same set of city navigator north america nt 2008 map data twice  .
now that would be inflation also , all functions of the unit are not usable when plugged in to a usb  .
so , as shipped , the only way to use/program the device while charging it is in your car  .
so , plan on buying the ac adaper if you want to play with the 760 outside your car  .
no carry case included either it seems like garmin stuffed a lot of complex features in this device to try to make it all in one , but in that process they made it more difficult to to do many things that are more easily done on the computer .
i loved this product when i first got it , and still enjoy it's convenience for the most part  .
my only two issues are   1  .
the battery is already dead , wo not hold a charge and garmin has the shortest warranty time ever  .
the map update is so expensive , dang it .
i personally made a mistake by buying garmin 760 or would have made a mistake buying any other garmin  .
i have been using 760 for 6 months  .
several times it did confuse me by missing turns or giving me wrong direction  .
the voice sucks as it is computer generated voice  .
fm transmitter is absolutely useless  .
i get a lot of static noise when trying to transmit sound to the speakers  .
so , if you are paying extra money just to get this feature and few others compared to 260 models it would be complete waste of money now the interesting part  .
after borrowing magellan from my the friend of mine i found out that magellan is much better than garmin and i will tell you why    .
magellan has a feature that allows you to choose from four different route options   1  .
shortest distance , 2  .
fastest time , 3  .
most use of freeways and 4  .
avoid toll roads  .
in magellan user is given these choices right after finding the address on the unit and before pushing the button go  .
garmin models , including my 760 in its turn allows you only to choose these options in a static way i  .
e you need to go the settings of the unit  .
given the fact that your each route is different , where in one you may approximately know way to a destination , but want to take freeway , while in another trip you may want to choose the shortest distance  .
this is the major cons of the garmin as it makes you to change the settings every time before you start your trip 2  .
the voice commands  .
compared to magellan's garmin has a most irritating computer generated voice , which sometimes could be hard to understand  .
my friend's magellan did not have this problem  .
magellan allows you to search cities also by typing zip code , so it eliminates the need to type more than 5 letter/digits and then it allows you to choose right city from the list if there is more than one in a zip code 4  .
in magellan if you find a point of interest such as a restaurant , store etc it brings up also a telephone number  .
which i find very useful  .
garmin does not have it  .
magellan rings a chime a few yards to remind you before you need to make a turn  .
while there are more than five major differences that makes magellan a better choice , i think the listed above would help a potential buyer to understand better the only thing i found in garmin better than magellan is a little better resolution screen  .
design of garmin also appears better than magellan's  .
so , if you are a buyer who is looking for design then go for garmin , if for functionality and usability , then magellan will be your best friend .
i would recommend buying a cheaper unit that lacks fm transmission but has all the other nuvi features     .
700 series has a known problem with loss of audio  .
i believe it should be a recall at this point  .
beware  .
the last one i purchased had intermittent sound/audio speaker output loss right out of the box  .
i did not even have a chance to register it  .
i spoke with garmin on the phone , they registered it and instructed me to ship it to them (at my expense) for an immediate replacement upon receipt  .
they lied  .
after a couple of days of my receipt of delivery which i tracked i told them the exact time they received it then received back an e    mail stating it is not in their system and when received it would be a general turnaround up to 14 days for repair  .
ok so one hand does not know of the others promises but at the very least reimburse or supply free shipping of a defective pos  .
this is just a note to beware of what the manufacturer says as opposed to what the really do  .
i use to love garmin products but the company seems to be going to the dogs .
i have the tom tom go 720  .
my friend bought the 760 to replace his nuvi 660  .
to tell you the truth , i dont see the big deal  .
so it has a few more bells and whistles than the 660  .
garmin has everyone brainwashed into thinking they have a superior product  .
dont get me wrong , the 760 is really pretty and does what it is supposed to do  .
however it is way too pricey  .
i say either stick with the 660 or jump ship altogether and get the go 720 for much less money and the same or better features .
although this unit is better than nothing , it is no where near the godsend that professional reviewers suggest  .
bad speech  .
bad speaker  .
fm transmission marginally better , but very unfriendly in crowded fm cities , as expected  .
unreliable accuracy occasionally sending me through intersections only to route back through u    turns  .
whether this is a software or firmware issue is unknown  .
all i know is it is frustrating  .
shortest time routes frequently miscalculate common roads and make the trip an exercise in science fiction  .
funky routing to say the least  .
hard to see proper lanes on maps  .
not nearly enough warning on lane changes or upcoming info make this unit very frustrating  .
i did not use or care about bluetooth or music or pictutres  .
who does  .
i only want dead accurate and easy driving gps use  .
would very much like to have seen (heard) a beep or chime when lane change or merge were coming up  .
it is extraordinarily frustrating to have to look at the screen all the time when entering unfamiliar freeway interchanges  .
i shudder to think of bringing this unit to los angeles or chicago or some other highway hell city  .
it would be downright dangerous  .
too hard to hear , too hard to read , not nearly enough heads up warning on important direction issues  .
waaayyyyy too hard to hear and understand  .
i will be selling this 760 and will buy something else anything else .
right out of the box the unit would not charge in the car and i noticed that the fuse is blown inside the cigarette charger cord  .
i then had to go to radio shack to buy special fuses for it  .
i replaced the fuse and thinking that that had probably solved the problem , took it to vegas on a business trip  .
however , the unit is still not charging in the car in vegas  .
i then tried another fuse which did not help  .
i then called garmin and they set up an rma for me to return the cord to them for repairs but they wanted me to pay for the shipping even though this unit is only two weeks old , had only been used twice and the car charger is broken out of the box and had never worked  .
i then emailed the garmin cust ser rep that had assisted me asking for a shipping call tag as i did not feel that i should have to pay to ship a brand new defective unit to them and i got no reply whatsoever  .
at that point i decided that returning it to costco is the way to go here  .
garmin is also supposed to overnight me a replacement cord to use while the original is repaired , minus the fm receiver in the cord as that is over $200 according to the garmin cust ser rep , but it never is delivered  .
good thing i is able to take it back to where i had bought it rather then dealing with garmin  .
costco promptly refunded my money with no questions or issues  .
i still need a gps for business trips and will be buying something soon but i  .
m not sure which manufacturer now  .
other then the defective cord issue , and a poor customer service experience with garmin , i did really like the device and it is a huge improvement over using microsoft streets trip  .
s w/gps on my notebook while open on the front seat of the car .
took this gps on road trip to boston and is lost many , many times  .
constantly recalculating and losing it's signal  .
very fustrating trip considering the cost of gas our previous trip to pa went well  .
gps is very acurate for that trip not worth the extra $ , returning it to costco .
i have used both the magellan 800 and the garmin 760 , and the garmin is a piece of junk to a person who has used the magellan , otherwise it is a good unit  .
here are the drawbacks all may not apply to everyone , but some may 1  .
garmin shows you which street you are approaching next , whereas magellan shows you which street you are currently travelling on  .
to me , it is much more important to know which street you are on , as upcoming street you can anyways see on the map 2  .
when you arrive at the destination , garmin does not tell you that you have arrived , whereas magellan does  .
again another very big plus for the magellan 3  .
i kept the garmin unit permanently plugged in , and each time i would start my car , the unit would also start up and i would have to manually turn it off  .
this is very irritating  .
there should be a simple on/off button and the unit should turn on when i want it to , and not always 4  .
the voice recorded is not the best , and could have been better in the garmin  .
this is noticed by everyone that sat in my car , even though i tried all options to change it 5  .
the garmin unit does not give you the option to change from a birds eye view map to a simple 2d map using a simple click , and one has to go into the settings each time to change this , whereas the magellan has a small on    screen button for this really adds to the user experience 6  .
while searching pois , most of the time i found that it did not have most of the pois , whereas my 2 year old magellan had that information so one wonders what use are the extra added pois ask garmin that 7  .
bluetooth option is irritating  .
as we all know any bluetooth device when switched on and then off and then on again , may or may not connect up /sync up again , and the garmin keeps prompting you that the bluetooth is not connected , untill you change the settings again not a task you can do while you are driving 8  .
the voice navigation resets to blank by itself , so next time you switch on the unit , you will find that it is not giving voice commands and you will have to go into user settings and change it again all in all folks , the unit is more of a pain to operate , and though it may seem like i am promoting magellan , but i have used only these 2 sets , and above points are my experience  .
my first magellan unit screen froze and while is deciding if i want to get it reparied , i decided to upgrade and buy the latest set and to my bad luck i bought the garmin 760 i sold my brand new garmin unit after 2months of use at a loss of $200 , just because it did not have useful features i will now go buy another magellan , or try to get my older one fixed .
i had all of the above cons arise with one unit , which i switched for a new unit (new serial # etc  .
) and it has the exact same issues  .
you can find the same complaints online if you google nuvi 760 big issue #1   the audio has issues in general , the voice breaks in and out as if a speaker wire is loose  .
then the voice will completely disappear for weeks at a time  .
when you try to reselect the voice in the settings , it says no voices found  .
the gps mapping works fine with no voice , but you are just reading off the screen and miss turns if you are not watching closely (with your eyes off the road) big issue #2   locks up when turned on more than 50% of the time  .
the initial screen says maps loading but it just sits there indefinitely  .
you must hard reset the unit by holding the power switch to off position for about 5 seconds  .
i have tried updating the the most recent firmware and as i've said , the exact same issues arose with the first and replacement unit gps mapping works fine most of the time , though there have been some bugs  .
once the nuvi took me to the wrong city when the correct city is selected in the destination .
after buying this device for $400 , i thought i will have lot of help finding directions but i is wrong  .
i do not know why everyone recommends this as i brought this from recommendations  .
i went to best buy and the sales guys recommended garmin , i went to circuit city and they recommended this one too (garmin) , i checked on the web and garmin has the best reviews but i is really disappointed when i actually used it  .
i liked the design , garphics , ease of use and very user friendly but when it came to showing directions , it send me through the long route 2 times , i wasted about 2 hours extra on my first trip  .
other thing i got very much fustrated is that everytime i turned the device on , it took a while to get the gps signal , sometimes i had to wait 2 minutes and most of the times (95%) i had to restart the unit  .
it started getting on my nerves  .
i called the garmin tech support and they gave me a 2009 maps upgrade and reset the device , still the same thing  .
it came to a point that i called garmin support almost everyday during that week  .
i finally returned the product from where i had bought and i bought a tomtom 730  .
this one gives me gps signals almost instant as soon as i turn the device on  .
i do not understand how other users are giving high rating on this device unless and untill i got a lemon , well , i have a tomtom and i am happy with it .
i will not buy any garmin product since i had this experience  .
it already waste me one day driving  .
i need to go back with the paper mapquest  .
i still trust mapquest more than gps  .
gps sucks .
EASE OF USE....PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!; PRICE WAS MY ONLY CONCERN .NEED TO GET MORE OF THESE OUT TO THE PUBLIC.
Improvement over the Nuvi 660 , WQVGA LCD, Multiple Routes ,MSN� Direct for U.S. compatible; Weak FM transmitter
Easy Interface, nice screen. Fully loaded with many options including msn direct; Speaker could be louder. Sometimes hickups when calling out streets.
Easy to use; MP3 player doesn't recognise all SD cards
Beautiful and bright 4.3" screen with Text To Speech, Traffic, and Bluetooth.; No carry case or house AC adapter are far from show stoppers.
Good product if it does what Garmin says it will. I own more than one and like them when they work.; Known problems and after sale customer service.
Larger screen, Bluetooth, FM transmitter; Shorter battery life, due to larger screen...but OK
Seems to be on target; Speaker quality
Good Map colors.; Bad sound recording, information on screen is useless, Unit turns on by itself, POI are useless, POI search is useless.
Route Planner makes planning trips easy. Quick Customer Service; Limited to creating only 12 routes. No detailed User manuals included
picks up satellite better than the nuvi 200; not very acurate in boston
Feature rich, easy to setup; Maps not 100%
great mic for bluetooth speakerphone, good UI; no multi route option, no "escape to home menu" buttons
Availability to sort routes ,Brighter Screen, Bluetooth is great.; None So Far
Easy to use, very accurate, well supported.; Pricey, non user replaceable battery,
Looks sleek; big screen; No MapSource support; touch screen feels loose and unlaminated; very pricy; includes complex features best done with MapSource on your computer
Easy to learn without reading a manual. Good quality.; Too soon to realize faults. No carrying case.
Bluetooth, Wide screen 4:3 , easy to use; none at this point
Graphics, Ease of use, good for beginners; No GPS signal for 2 minutes in an open parking lot, FM transmision sucks, wrong directions, overcharged
Nuvi 760 is very portable, nice colors, good screen clarity at any time of day.; Computer voices are bad
Top knotch route calculation. Great screen. Best in bread vehicle mounting hardware. Bluetooth works!; Internal speaker is weak but usable. FM transmitter is only useful out of the city.
Very accurate, easy to use - 6 million Points of Interest; None at this point
good looking; For example, choose shorter distance from Chicago to Toronto. The GPS will show the direction from Chicago to New York and head north to Vermont and South to Toronto. Totally useless, waste money and time (2362KM) compare with Mapquest 900Km.
Handy, ease of use, easy to set up; Sometimes may take a few extra secs to find satellites
Compact size but big in features, clear speaker, and ease of use makes this unit a cut above the rest.; haven't found any as yet
Accurate routing engine, fast routing speed, fast boot up and satellite acquisition time, excellent touch screen, easy navigation, outstanding mount system, reasonable price, large POI database; Mechanized voice quality, slow download speeds from the Garmin website, some static over the FM transmitter, TMC real time traffic is inaccurate.
Was much better then using Microsoft Streets &#38; Trips w/GPS on my notebook to navigate in the car.; Unit would not charge in the car...defective cigarette charger cord.
POI very good. Bright screen. Good address entry.; Bad speech. Bad speaker.Unreliable accuracy.Funky routing.Hard to see proper lanes on maps Not nearly enough warning on lane changes or upcoming info.Would very much like to have seen (heard) a beep or chime when lane change or merge were coming up.
perfect routing, ETA, readjusts to your path, many options, easy Plug &#38; Play, warns in advance and at the turn... and which lane!; cumbersome to enter addresses, not verbal
Very strong signal reception, fast start up, great support software, accurate and vast Points of Interests, very bright and colorful, incredible fast and easy interface and menus(very intuitive); no AC adapter included, nighttime/daytime brightness auto feature based on time of day, not a light sensor.
Small size, Bluetooth, MSN Direct Enhanced, Bright Screen; No Custom Avoidances, No categories under Favorites, No Attention tone while on the phone and a turn is coming up, Bluetooth issues with some Blackberries, no remote
Great readouts, good voice and vehicle choices, good POI database, Blue Tooth compatability.; Does not allow you to add info to Favorites. Sometimes takes to long to load maps. When using a wall charger, does not have a meter to show battery is charged.
The 760 fits in my shirt pocket. It continus to work just fine.; The nag screen showing that the map is old, so what, the roads I drive on are even older!
Lookup isn't as intuitive at they think. Jumps to conclusion, doesn't permit me to continue spelling a street name. View isn't as nice as lookng at a City Map, I suppose that's a matter of personal; Look up not intuitive enough. Stops working when it thinks you have answer. Map view not as good as City Street Map, not as good as wife's MDX Nav.
Performs extremely well for what it was designed to do. All features work extremely well.; Somewhat finicky about street name input. Volume needs to be set via menu options. FM connectivity with the vehicles radio could be better, but I know the output is limited by government regulations.
Turn by turn directions, screen readability, ease of use; When it's cold out, it takes quite some time to obtain the signal. Pin-point of location is not that great.
Large screen, fairly large number of POIs, GPS mapping works pretty well; Significant bugs in this model, voice directions disappear frequently, locks up when turned on more than 50% of the time...says "maps loading" then will not move on unless power switch held in off position to reset, sometimes incorrect directions
1. Nice display. 2. Nice Design; 1. Route type options such as Fastest time, shortest distance, most use of freeways,avoid tolls. These options are in the settings and you need to modify settings for each route. 2. Voice is computer generated hard to understand. and many more....
Smaller size, built in ant. no flip up. Picks up signal very fast, Bluetooth works great,Great screen day and nite,as well as screen lock. Car locator is a big plus; Only have it a week, the volume could be a bit louder, does not have the tone indicator as the 660.
Lots of features including traffic as an option. Keep satellite lock well once locked on. Lots of POIs and easy to find and add more.; Sometimes slow to update directions, seems to lag when making a turn before the GPS actually catches up to position. I have 2 of these units and they have both forzen up on a couple of occasions each. I did the latest updates, seems better.
Great GPS with many very useful features - Blue Tooth works great.; FM transmission to a car radio is full of static - no matter how many frequencies tried - my iPod FM transmitters work great - Garmin says the weak broadcast is FCC regulated -NOT! - condition same on both first defective and replacement unit
Great functions, like the whole Bluetooth application ( now-a-days what doesn't have it) and I really like the fact you can use it as a hands-free device... Very nice looking and it's a Garmin.... Oh and customer service waqs fantastic...; Well the hands free device didn't really live up to my expectations, When i called my girlfriend through the hands-free she told me i sounded kind of strange, but it might be because I was close to her. Now the big one is that it died2 mths later!
This thing is way cool when it's working. Blue tooth is great. One thing I liked is that you can search for a point of interest near your destination or your current route, which was great for road trips.; The dang thing will not hold a charge, Garmin has a WEAK WEAK WEAK warranty. Map updates are insanely pricey. If you spend this much money on something, you should be able to update it for free.
I got my unit as a gift and immediately used it for a trip from Texas to New Mexico. Easy to use out of the box. Bluetooth paired quickly with my Blackberry. Lots of POI.; Calibration is off about 30-50'. Not a problem when on the highway, during the day. At night going through a neighborhood I missed a few turns because the streets were close together and it told me to turn after the turn.
