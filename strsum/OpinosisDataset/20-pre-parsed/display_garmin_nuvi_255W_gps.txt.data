3 quot  widescreen display was a bonus .

also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .

the bad ,  my unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .

it also can display and speak many languages .

the garmin has a nice 3d display .

the 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the arrow .

well when i saw that the 255w had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner i jumped at it .

the 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit .

through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .

but is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .

i have checked the display in three areas i am familiar with :

since the directions are also displayed on the screen, i find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .

so i finally got the nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in circuit city and best buy stores displays .

the display is great, and is very clear .

even setting the display to maximum detail is far from adequate .

the unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .

one unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .

the 255w has a really clear display that's easy to see in any light .

update on this ,  it finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .

for me, the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .
