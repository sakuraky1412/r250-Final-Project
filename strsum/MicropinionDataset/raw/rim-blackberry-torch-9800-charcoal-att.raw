Pros:. Very responsive touchscreen. Legendary BB keyboard. Screen resolution is far better than "expert reviewers" would imply.. 
Cons:. I have no complaints at all.. 
Summary:. I have many friends who have iphones, and Andrdoid devices, and although they are very "cool" phones, ALL of them were very impressed with my Torch. I played with, and tested many devices for over 2 months before making my decision. Was really quite stressed about which phone to get. In the end, the look, feel and overall bulid quality of the Torch won me over. Absolutely no regrets.. Updated. on Nov 10, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. BB OS 6, nice design, excellent reception, the option to use either the touchscreen or physical keyboard, nice camera, battery life, theme of motion apps, email, BB messenger, Universal Search, call quality, social networking format.. 
Cons:. Too easy to lock the screen ( button is sensitive), video recorder is not HDMI 720P, the checkerboard pattern that shows up sometimes when scrolling or zooming.. 
Summary:. I'm really loving this phone. It gave me a reason to stick with BlackBerries when I was kinda skeptical before. And I grow more into it day by day. My sister is about to upgrade. She never owned a BB before but she says the Torch will be her next phone. I have no regrets about purchasing this phone. Good job RIM.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Touch screen. -New OS6. -Keyboard. -Universal Search. -Trackpad. -Can be themed. -Homescreen notifications. -All the right context menus. -Battery life. -Slider. -Screen is great for such a small device. -Call Quality. ....list goes on. 
Cons:. None yet. Still loving the device.. 
Summary:. When I first read the professional reviews, I was disappointed because I was looking forward to buying this device. I think the bloggers and tech reviewers were very biased and really only looked at the spec sheets and knit picked at irrelevant stuff, as if they where on Apple's payroll. I really think they did the public an injustice by not giving this device a fair shake. When you actually use the device for what a smart phone is for, this device is awesome in every respect. It's never out of battery when I need to use it, even at 11:00pm in the evening after using it all day. I use to have to stand beside a wall socket every 2 hours for 20 minutes when I had a iphone. Those days of being an Apptard are gone now. I've recovered from my brain failure. I'm glad I bought it and didn't listen to those tech journalists.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good call quality, good battery life, QWERTY keyboard for text/message/BBM/email/search, trackpad for scrolling and mouse-like functionality, touchscreen, universal search,good interface, tabbed browsing, just a really well designed, practical phone.. 
Cons:. Very little not to like, so I will nitpick. Its a bit slower in data transfers than many of the other top smartphones out there. Apps get stored to your BB memory instead of the SD Card and it could use more apps.. 
Summary:. Everyone will compare this to AT&#38;T's more famous exclusive phone, the iPhone4. Its true the iPhone 4 has a lot more apps, better screen resolution, a camera on each side, facetime, faster processor, a slightly larger screen, and the marketing hype behind it as the "IT" phone right now. But if you look at overall practicality in what really matters more and what you are likely to use more, the Blackberry Torch is actually the superior phone in the real world when considering the strengths and weaknesses of both devices.. First consider the specs- iPhone has the edge, but does it matter? Whether a screen is 3.5" or 3.1",it is not really noticeable, its a cell phone screen, not a big screen tv. Same goes for the iPhone's screen resollution, when screens are that small, does it matter? Will you ever use Facetime? You might try it once when the moons align, but,I have Skype on my PC, great idea, but I never really use it. So what I am saying is the lack of a second camera really doesn't matter either. Iphone4 does have a faster processor, so you will wait a few more seconds for data on a Torch, but its not unbearably slow.. Now here is why I strongly believe the Torch is the best AT&#38;T phone, for practical reasons. Many of these hyped up phones are touchscreen only with no QWERTY keyboard and horrible battery life due to everything being done in touchscreen display. BB Torch has a good QWERTY keyboard for superior texting/messaging/email/search, a trackpad to act as a mouse for superior scrolling, and of course the touchscreen interface as well.. Think about it, a second camera you will never use or a keyboard you will want to use everyday? Best call quality I have heard on an AT&#38;T phone so far, have yet to have a dropped call. Iphone4 has "attenna-gate" or "grip of death" which is "fixed" with a rubber protector? Also if your friends have BB's you can save money on a cheaper texting plan with BBM being unlimited for fellow BB users.. So the Torch is better at texting, messaging, emails, searching, scrolling, call quality, organization than any other AT&#38;T phone. Iphone4 has the edge in slightly faster data transfers, a lot more apps (which 99.9% of are a complete waste of time for all smartphones), and tech specs that don't matter in the real world.. I would say its a slam dunk for the Torch over the iPhone4, but people are generally more taken by clever marketing than practical uses for their devices.. As for other carrier phones like many of the Android based phones, this phone certaintly holds its own and can also be said that it is every bit as good or better than any of those phones. The Droid and Droid 2 have the touchscreen/QWERTY combo design to compete favorably without going into great detail into why I think the Torch is better than any other phone out there in practical design and use, but many other like the Palm Pre (similar design), HTC EVO, Droid X, Droid Incredible, Samsung Galaxy, all for many reasons I really believe fall short of the Torch bc of practicality.Palm Pre- great design, but no apps, many other of those phones have dreadful battery life where you need to carry a second battery around and I think the Droid X and HTC EVO are just too damn big to carry comfortably in your pocket too. I do have to give props to some phones that use flash though, but for what exists right now, I think the BB Torch is the best out there.... 

$$;
Pros:. This is a 'solid' phone in every respect. Not only does it step up the game for RIM it just builds on RIM's solid dependability and adds better performance.. 
Cons:. Woiuld be nice to have a bigger and better screen.. 
Summary:. I have had been using an iPhone along with my BB which I kept for its untouchable email performance. This new Torch does everything I want my iPhone to do and adds BB dependability. The reception is top notch. I can receive calls in places where my iPhone just does work at all. While there may be more apps for Android or iPhone there are more than enough for me, literally hundreds that I can use on the Torch. Botton line is this BB is 'quality' not just an excuse for a phone overlayed with an iPod.. 

$$;
Pros:. Internet/browser 100x faster than all the other bb's. Wow. Has the same pinch and zoom as the iphone does.. 
Cons:. It's a bit heavier than the iphone and all the other blackberries. But it feels solid ...expensive. Doesn't bother me at all.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Torch has both touch screen and QWERTY capabilities, which give me more flexibility to navigate the phone. The Torch is atTrue business phone with PDA attributes/qualities. The phone has both media and business capabilities.. 
Cons:. The Torch has limited website video capabilities - the phone will not play videos on certain websites like the iphone.. 
Summary:. The Torch is not limited to just media capabilities like the iPhone, Droid, etc, which are "app." and "media" driven. Note: Apps. are only useful when you are going to use them; some apps are a waste. Too many apps. can drain your phone's battery. There is too much of hype over apps instead of phone capabilities, functionality, and practicality. The Torch is a practical phone with excellent emailing and texting features that are logical. In addition, the contact program file is very systematic and practical - it is similar to the Microsoft Outlook contact setup process. The phone's camera is great. The Torch has great multitasking capabilities - you can navigate from program to program with ease.. Note: anyone having problems with some of the applications when you first purchased the phone, I recommend that you upgrade the phone to the newest software version. I believe the original software version that comes on the phones, that are in inventory now, have some bugs. At first, I ran into some problems with my phone. However, when I upgraded my software, I have had no problems with my Torch.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone sucks. Fact.. 
Cons:. I hatï¿½ this phone.. 
Summary:. Its horrible GPS dies not work at all. Internet sucks. Phone is sluggish. And slow. Rim should be ashamed. seriously. The only reason I rated this phone five stars is because I have a hard time admitting when I'm wrong. And clearly I was in choosing this phone. The phone is pure garbage.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great improvement over Bold. Fast. Great screen. Lots of clever improvements and still the best devices for getting work done fast.. 
Cons:. cramped keyboard takes a little effort with my big thumbs. 
Summary:. Tried two android phones (evo, Captivate) and just could not do without a physical keyboard or the syncing with Outlook. BB makes it painless. Also, a big improvement over the bold and solves many of the problems I was facing with that phone. Very happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. All of the great things about owning a Blackberry device combined with the great things that made us jealous of touchscreen phones. The phone has amazing capabilities and still has the things you like about Blackberry.. 
Cons:. None. You have to wipe off the touchscreen a lot. Even if you plan on using this a Blackberry with a huge screen, you will eventually start using the touch functions anyway.. 
Summary:. Superb phone! This phone does all of the very nice adult functions that we love about Blackberry and combines the touchscreen, apps, and games that made us jealous of our kids' i-phone and android phone. It is an amazing innovation that closes the gap between childish touchscreen phones and adult business phones. It does this by allowing you to use it like a conventional Blackberry or using it like your kid's i-phone. It does both and does both very well! I thought I would never use touchscreen and am finding that I use it quite a lot actually.. I was always jealous when my kids would show me pictures on their huge touchscreen. Now I whip out my Blackberry and do the exact same thing back and laugh. What people don't know, or seem to not realize, is how much more capable Blackberry is a a PDA for organizing your life. I am extremely pleased with the new phone and Blackberry in general.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Physical Keyboard. -Excellent Messaging Capability. -Greatly Improved Browser. -Very competent Touchscreen. 
Cons:. -Relatively low screen resolution. -Lack of 3D support due to hardware restrictions. -Slightly laggy in the browser on very large sites.. -Preloaded OS 6 version .141 is laggy (upgrades to leaked OS will make it MUCH better). 
Summary:. Overall the Torch is an excellent device. The keyboard is what I've come to expect from a Blackberry after coming from a Bold 9000. This is my fourth Blackberry and their capacity for connectivity and messaging has not dwindled in the least. The touch screen allows for an experience unattainable for most Blackberry users (excluding Storm users of course) whiel the physical keyboard allows for comfortable keying in of long emails, essays, and anything else you might need to write up on the go. The browser is an absolute godsend especially after having three different Blackberries with mediocre browsers. The Torch loads pages a bit slower than the iPhone 4 and various Android devices, but fortunately this slight delay should not phase most users as it is only a couple seconds difference at worst. The inclusion of OS 6 introduces universal searching and various views (All, Favorite, Frequent, Media, etc) which is a welcome addition for organizing apps, contacts, and files on the Torch. My only qualm with this is the present inability to create custom views which I hope is a feature that will be present on future OS updates. Note that all my comments reflect upgrades to ANY of the leaked operating systems. The OS version on board at the time of launch was iffy at best and suffered from lag. If you want a device that is perfect out of the box this may not be right for you. The same holds true if you would like to upgrade your OS, but are incapable of doing so (have a Mac or are technologically impaired). I'm currently running version .246 and it is absolutely excellent. You will have no regrets if you upgrade your OS. Most dedicated Blackberry users will have no problem with the Torch and will have few qualms or regrets about purchasing one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very very good phone, even way better quality call, battery stand time. Very sharp screen with 5mp camera/flash. Web browser is also very multi-tasking and fast. Rubberized back cover to hold the phone in place even in very smooth surface. Excellent!. 
Cons:. Only At&#38;t carriers. Though it can be unlocked. Video quality could be little better. Should have comes with the desktop charger. Free At&#38;t wifi should not use data service from the phone, there is no way to turn that off and use free wifi hot spot. 
Summary:. Had it for almost a month. Still exploring. Excellent phone, feels very good in hand. I also have the iphone-4 which is also a good phone, but for me Torch is much better. The reason is in iphone-4 to me feels like more of kids phone, they should change there user interface. Every time you turn on the iphone it feels all the programs are wide open on the screen, which to me more like a kids friendly. Hey that's my opinion. But I have friends they like the iphone better than any other phones. For me Torch is way better than any other phones in the market. I love the interface, functionality and memory. It takes up to 32mmc card, which is really cool features because you can always change the card and use as a external memory for other devices. Or, you can just different card for different uses depending how much memory you need. iphone that's on of the big con and so as their battery. Never exchangeable. I have had many different phones over the years, BlackBerry TORCH is one of the best phone I used.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good battery life. Fun. Everything you want in a phone. 
Cons:. Touch screen texting is really hard for me not as responsive as a iphone. 
Summary:. for people who love blackberrys but considering an iphone you must get this phone you will not be dissapointed. 

$$;
Pros:. Phone and Messaging. Notification System. Easy Access to Settings. Universal Search. Physical Keyboard. Multitasking. Shortcuts. Physical Keys. Slider Quality. Webkit Browser. Customizable Profiles. Music Sync. 5 MP Camera. Auto On/Off. Good Battery Life. 
Cons:. Low Resolution Screen. Relatively Slow Processor. No HD Video. Webkit Browser still needs improving. 
Summary:. I have really been satisfied with the performance of the Blackberry Torch. There are so many features I love on this phone.. Pros Explanation:. ?	Great Phone and Messaging Device - Number one priority for a smart phone is calling and messaging. This phone excels at both.. ?	Notification System - Notifications for apps(email, SMS, phone, Facebook, calendar, etc.) appear in the notification bar at the top of the screen.. ?	Easy Access to Quick Settings - Tapping the top of the screen brings up connectivity options, alarm settings, and links to other phone options.. ?	Universal Search - Start typing on the physical keyboard from the home screen to search the entire phone or after typing tap the browser icon to search Google.. ?	Physical Keyboard - First of all, great for typing. Second, doesn't take up space on the screen (virtual keyboards block much of the screen) so you can view emails, texts, etc. much better.. ?	So Many Options - OS 6 works well by touch and by using the track pad. Both methods together create a great experience. One place the track pad is very useful for is clicking small links on web pages, because it is very hard to be accurate with your finger.. ?	Multitasking - Very quick and easy to use. I use it all the time to browse and SMS at the same time. Even works well with many applications running.. ?	Shortcuts - The physical keyboard is very useful for speed dial, copying and pasting, and the many many other shortcuts in OS 6.. ?	Physical Keys - (Send, menu, escape, end) Very useful, one major problem I have with some touch screen phones is the lack of these physical keys. Holding the menu key in any app brings up the multitasking screen.. ?	Well Constructed Slider Mechanism - Smooth sliding action, no wobble that affects usage.. ?	Webkit Browser - A major upgrade to Blackberry browsing. Best feature is double tap to wrap text so it fits the screen, making reading text much easier. Also has pinch to zoom.. ?	Customizable Profiles - Sound profiles have many many options. You can change settings for all types of notifications. Easy access to profiles from home screen. The flashing LED alert (which can be disabled) is one of my favorite Blackberry features.. ?	Wifi Music Sync - Easy and efficient way to transfer music to your phone. Works Great! Has normal headphone jack.. ?	Social Networking Integration - Facebook, Twitter, etc.. ?	5 MP Camera - Takes great photos, has flash.. ?	Auto On/Off - Conserves battery.. ?	Visual Voice Mail - Much easier than calling your voice mail to listen to messages.. ?	Good Battery Life - Will definitely last at least all day even for heavy users.. Cons Explanation:. ?	Low Resolution Screen in comparison to some other new smart phones. However in my opinion the physical keyboard (because it doesn't waste screen space as a virtual keyboard does) makes up for this most of the time.. ?	Slow processor (compared to other new smart phones) - However I have not had any problems with lag even when running multiple applications.. ?	No HD video.. ?	Webkit browser still is not perfect. I hope the performance on many sites will be improved with new OS updates. CONCLUSION:. The Torch should be great for anyone who wants a very reliable smart phone for calling and messaging with many other great features and apps. This review probably seems fairly long, but I just touched the surface of the many features of this phone. I am still finding new features and shortcuts every day. I would definitely recommend this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. The touchscreen is amazing. Very responsive. Combined touchscreen with blackberry keyboard is unbeatable. New OS 6 is more intuitive and even improves on the overall experience of a blackberry. Optical touchpad HUGE advantage over every other phone.. 
Cons:. I wish this was on a different network than AT&#38;T. Not as snappy and quick as other OS's out there but definitely not slower than previous blackberrys. Wish there was more OEM accessories available right now but I'm sure they'll come. 
Summary:. My expectations of this new Blackberry Torch were pretty low just based on all the negative reviews I've seen. But after I picked it up and brought it home I can say with a clear conscience that not only is this the best Blackberry to date, but for most people its the best phone on the market. First I'll talk about the positives. WOW. RIM really knocked it out of the park with this phone. People all use their smartphones for different things these days but the common denominators such as texting emailing surfing the web posting status updates etc, this new Torch does all of them the best. You CANNOT BEAT A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD. No touchscreen with "Swype" technology, no predictive text, no T9 can replace a physical keyboard that you dont have to even look at to type on. I type 90 wpm on a regular keyboard and 75WPM on a QWERTY blackberry keyboard, so being able to type fast accurate and confidently is the most important thing to me and there is no other phone that comes even close mostly because they are all touchscreens. BUT now that I have a full touchscreen I have the best of both worlds. One advantage of this touchscreen versus others is the optical touchpad. I have big fingers and that was one of my problems with iPhones is when selecting text to highlight or clicking on a link I would always end up hitting something else. Very frustrating. But with this new Blackberry touchscreen you have all the fun swiping gestures and thumb slides and zoom features like any other touchscreen but you can also get exact and precise with the optical touchpad. Very cool. The Blackberry OS is great and I think RIM is being smart by not trying to emulate other phones while also keeping up with what cool things people are using their phones for these days. Blackberrys are cool too the media just adores the iPhone and Droid even though Kanye West Justin TImberlake Paris Hilton Barack Obama T.I. Justin Bieber JayZ Lebron James Kobe Conan Katy Pery Lady Gaga and the list goes on and on of celebs that own and use and love Blackberrys. Thats THE A-list crowd too. The only con in previous blackberrys was small screen but thats been fixed now with this good size touchscreen. One of the cons that I have been hearing that is pretty ridiculous is screen resolution. I dont watch HD movies on my phone and with the exception of phones on the 4g Sprint network, 3g isnt even close to fast enough to stream high resolution videos. iPhone 4 videos from youtube espn facebook etc. dont look any better because the videos are all the same resolution and look the same on any phone. Not to say that this phone's screen is lame either cause its not. Its a little higher than my Bolds resolution and theres noway you can watch the demo videos on the Torch or Bold and not be impressed. The screen is great. So bottom line, if you want a phone that gets stuff done as opposed to plays silly games then this is the one for you. If you want a phone that combines good looks with the reliability of Blackberry then this phone is for you. And if you want to be able to do everything you want (text email status update surf web) faster and easier than other phones, than you cant miss with this one. The Blackberry Torch is a winner.. 

$$;
Pros:. great touch screen, full qwerty keyboard, quick app and data processing, gsm phone, another fantastic blackberry product.. 
Cons:. slightly oversized once you slide it open, touch screen a little hard to get used to after the 9550.. 
Summary:. I'm personally a big fan of the BlackBerry 9800. The touch screen combined with the full qwerty keyboard makes it much more user friendly than just one or the other. If you unlock it, its usable worldwide on all GSM networks. BBM is a huge help when communicating with international business contacts. Apple will have a tough time keeping up with RIM if they continue to produce cutting edge technology such as this. Although Apple crushed RIM in sales by 2 million dollars on the iPhone alone versus all BlackBerry models combined. Personally I like my &lt;a href=http://www.buymobile.net/blackberry/blackberry-torch-9800-atandt-unlocked.html?SID=f9a9f5d956989ac72c34234680ee27e0&gt;unlocked BlackBerry Torch&lt;/a&gt; and wouldn't have it any other way. Its even an improvement from the Storm 2 i was using before i got the Torch.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice combination of touch and analog kb. Works well with GMAIL calendar and contacts and the RIM+BIS sync. Good looking user interface, the touch screen adds new capabilities. Mixes a workhorse (Blackberry) with thye fun of a multimedia telelphone.. 
Cons:. Poor signal, it sucks!!! In some areas I can use my wifeï¿½s BB Bold telephone or my 80 year old motherï¿½s very basic Nokia, but the Stormï¿½s signal is dead or minimal, so i cannot make a phone call.. 
Summary:. I had for a few months the suplselly top of the line SAMSUNG GALAXY S, with its 1 ghz procesor and ANDROID 2.1; however the TORCH operates faster, for my taste. The sync servcie of RIM+BIS 3.2 is and excellent option but it does habe problemas when synquing multiple accounts with GMAIL (I use gmail apps). The new BB desktop software 6.0 is lovely. Overall I thing, if you are a gearhead, this phone will make happy while letting you work. Bottom line: if yoiur a business user, stick to the BOLD.... 

$$;
Pros:. Battery Life, OS 6, Push Email, Keyboard.. 
Cons:. Has frozen on me once.. 
Summary:. I've had the iphone 3g for the last 2 years, and the phone for the most part it has been great. When it came time to upgrade, I was set on trying something new , after being a little worn out on apple and all its proprietary dealings. The Samsung Captivate had just come out and I was like wow. Nice screen, droid platform, and basically I could do whatever I wanted to do. I tried the phone out for 20 days, and could not come 2 grips with spending the next 2 years with it. "Besides the simply amazing screen, it had Buggy GPS, Battery life was TERRIBLE with heavy use, Samsung Apps were sub-par. I returned the phone and went back to the Iphone 3g. After doing a lil more homework, I said let be give the BB Torch a try. So far, So Good, as I am still under my 30 trial period and seriously thinking about keeping it. I must admit i'm a little intrigued with the Windows 7 Phones, but figure they will be much better after a year or so . Over dinner the other night I let my friends who have the EVO 4g, and the I phone 4 check the Torch out and they were simply amazed. The screen comparison was different, but not by that much. All I can say is , VERY nice business phone. I've been wanting a to buy an Ipad, but will hold out to see how well the Torch and PlayBook dance together. Hopefully with the new PlayBook coming on board there will be more cool apps added to BB App World.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the social interfaces and BB Messenger. The new browser is excellent. The predictive text helper really works well. The sound quality of the phone is the best I've had on BB and this is my third BB. Easy access to all apps with a finger swipe!. 
Cons:. When using the clock app, it is too easy to touch the face and change the alarm time accidentally. The current OS6 revision is a little laggy on some jobs, but leaked OS upgrades are reported to have fixed this problem. Waiting for AT&#38;T to authorize.. 
Summary:. I bought this phone at 11am on release day, August 12, 2010. I have used it a lot and find it to be a pleasure to email, receive email, SMS and BB Messenger texts. Additionally, it has a podcast app that will download and save your favorite podcasts to hear later. The social feeds and RSS reader are a pleasure to use. The ability to post to several social sites at the same time (i.e. Facebook and Twitter) is very helpful. Photos taken with the 5mp camera can be instantly routed to social sites, and Twitter for BB and Facebook for BB come preloaded.. With onboard memory at 8GB (including the micro SDHC 4GB disk) there is plenty of room for downloading TV shows, music and other media including movies either by BB Data or better yet, over a WIFI network.. The Touchpad is an improvement over the roller ball. Additionally the phone just has a beautiful form--it is very attractive. Great job, RIM. AT&#38;T provides a fast 3G service that has never dropped a call on this phone yet.. Overall very satisfied and happy with my decision to part with my Bold 9000 and go with this great new device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice size touch screen, large enough for media entertainment yet still small enough for pocket carry.. Tremendous camera.. A huge upgrade in the media arena.. Maintains excellent call quality. 
Cons:. Screen lock is a little too easy to engage by accident.. Download screen and frequent screen make the home screen a little clumsy to navigate, they seem unnecessary and unable to remove.. As with all BB's the Icons are hard to distinguish between.. 
Summary:. The Torch moves the BlackBerry from a tremendous productivity tool to a productivity tool with excellent multimedia advances. The BB continues to set the standard for the ability to customize a smart phone to the users individual taste and needs. The vast BB options menu allow you to tweak the phone in near endless ways ie profiles, alerts, customizing of contacts, BlackBerry remains second to none.. The 5mp camera is strong enough to be a complete replacement for a point and shoot camera. Picture quality is extremely good. The video camera is excellent as well, though not as impressive as the still camera.. I have read several complaints about the screen resolution. This may simply be the most ridicules complaints I have ever seen on any phone. Even with a screen protector on my Torch video and picturing viewing is amazing. Most everyone complaining of the resolution has read the spec sheet and if you did not know the actual spec resolution you would not know you had anything to complain about. On a screen this small the resolution is more than acceptable. I still have my old iPhone and compared it to the Torch and the video was noticeably more pleasing on the torch, though that is simply an opinion.. The new browser, run by OS 6, is a huge leap forward compared to previous BlackBerry models. The larger (touch) screen along with the ability to view full web pages and a much faster browsing experience make the Torch a much more useful internet tool than any BB before it.. The mp3 player is another leap forward for BlackBerry. Sound quality is excellent. The BB mp3 player has always been ahead of the curve in sound quality and the Torch is no exception, and is on par with my Zune. The visual experience of the mp3 player is much more fun and pleasing than before and is very easy to navigate.. With the Torch, BlackBerry remains superior in the area of PDA. I am simply an average every day smart phone user, not a corporate user or a kid that uses my phone mainly as an entertainment device. I do not use an enterprise email account so I have little to say about the Torch as a corporate device. I do however use my BB to tether myself to the world as I travel all over the DFW area daily and am rarely at my office. The messaging abilities remain excellent. The ability to use multiple different types of virtual keyboards along with the slide out keyboard allow this phone to be customized to any users particular needs. Call quality and reception strength in low coverage areas remain among the strongest in the industry. Between my personal and work phones, on separate providers, I have had several different smart phones from different manufacturers over the past few years and BB remains the best in connectivity and call reception. As a PDA the BB needs a more useful alarm clock in order to set multiple alarms, this is a real weak spot with BB but can be remedied with an alarm clock app available at BlackBerry App World or Crackberry Superstore. However you can set as many alerts as you want through the calender, which I find easier to navigate with the touch screen on the Torch than my previous Bold 9700. I mostly use the phone, calender, memo pad, alarm clock, BB messenger, 3 email accounts, browser, camera, video camera, voice notes, and calculator. All of these options run great on the Torch, some complain about the touch screen lagging a bit which may be true but only if a micro fraction of a second is an issue to you. As far as I am concerned the phone is plenty responsive and any complaints about the responsiveness of the Torch are simply nitpicking.. Third party apps. Every BB owner should have a reset app on their phone set to reset the phone every day, this keeps the phone running smooth every day without doing a dreaded battery pull regularly. Another must have on every BB is the Addonis app. This app adds options to the BB that should already be there, like call firewall, caller blacklisting, wifi auto off. I use a weather app, Facebook, Pandora, Poynt, Twitter, Snaptu, Fox news, Pocket Express, Screen capture, Super Launch, a Bible app, and an app to my favorite radio station daily and all these apps run great on the torch, in fact it runs Pandora better than any previous BB I have owned and the Facebook app is much more pleasing on the larger touch screen.. If you every wanted a larger screen on you BB but were unwilling to give up your beloved manual keyboard, as I was, this is the BB for you though I am becoming accustomed to the virtual keyboard. This phone is first and foremost a productivity tool to get your daily objectives done, but it is also an excellent multimedia device with excellent picture, video and sound quality. This will be my phone for some time to come.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great touch screen.. great keyboard. Incredible inprobemenr on the OS6. Great browser. Solid feel on you hand. Awesome slide system. 
Cons:. It does have a small issue with signal when grabed by the top right corner. It can be a little bit slow at times, you just have to make sure you do not have much running on the background. 
Summary:. It is a fantastic BB. I would recomend it to anyone that need a great work.business phone that has both touch screen and keyboar. ONCE AGAIN IT IS NOT AN IPHONE, so if what you want is a toy then get an iphone. But if you need a work phone that will pass anyone security protocol, then get a BB.. 

$$;
Pros:. Processor speed is great. The new OS 6 is awesome. Love the design becuase its got the best of both worlds with the touch screen and full keyboard. I was skeptical becuase I was stepping up from the 9000, but I am thoroughly impressed.. 
Cons:. Needs to be powered on/off every few days as it will get a little sluggish but there are absolutely not other problems with this phone.. 
Summary:. You gotta get this phone. I am so happy with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Touch Screen.. 2. New OS is great. 3. Keyboard is great. 
Cons:. 1. Battery life isnt as good as other blackberries (to be expected). 2. AT&#38;T. 
Summary:. I recieved this blackberry while attending the release events in NYC. I've been using it for about a week now and im really addicted to it. As a blackberry this device is a huge step in the right direction. At first I thought the keyboard was a little strange to use but that went away in a couple days. I now prefer this keyboard over my old bold. The e-mail functions are amazing and the new OS makes it a pleasure to use. The way it syncs all your social events is great. The real glory of this device is the touchscreen. After using the touchscreen I dont know how I lived without it. As a blackberry this is the best yet. Its amazing to use and it'll keep my blackberry addiction going for at least another year. However if your looking at this phone as a possible iphone / android killer I think you'll be disappointed. This device tries to walk a thin line between corporate use and personal. This is something I believe it does very well. However if your looking for a personal phone an iphone or android are still better options.. 

$$;
Pros:. The touch screen, the form factor, the blackberry keyboard, the new os, and its looks pretty sexy. 
Cons:. the processor does dissapoint not in any way big enough to impact users(casual and power alike) but when you get to multiple apps runnin it will seem slow, and the screen really needs work compared to other phones screens are so good,. 
Summary:. The Torch is indeed the "best blackberry ever" and it is a good phone, but some places where it seriously lacks it the screen, and the apps(i mentioned the processor but i did say it was nothing that made too much of a difference) if blackberry wants to remain the best they must give incentives to younger users and casual users while maintaining and improving quality for business users lots and lots of my freinds have or had a blackberry, simply because of the keyboard, even the storm impressed them and they got used to presssing down the screen on the storm 1, but the apps are seriously lacking atleast if you want gaming apps and almost everyone does, plus try for a better camera Blackberry if you give the best in all departments people will come running to you no matter what the minus points, just look at the iphone 4 it delivers in every single department so people will use it even if it is on at&#38;t's bad network, and he screen seriuosly needs work atleast when every single phone comes out with a led screen.

$$;
Pros:. Universal Search is amazing, OS 6, new browser is better than the I-phone. 
Cons:. screen resolution is old school. 
Summary:. The best berry ever, RIM keeps releasing firmwear upgrades which have fixed virtually all performance issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone handles emails, texts, calendars, and more importantly PHONE CALLS - FLAWLESSLY. 
Cons:. It can be slow at times, out of long periods of no use it slow to get going. Also, if you start to play around more with apps etc, it lags down until you close them all out. AT&#38;T Service. 
Summary:. Overall : I purchased the iPhone 4 on launch day. I used that phone for a couple of months and had had enough. After some researching I discovered that Blackberry's Torch would be the perfect fit for me. I have owned the phone now for 3 weeks and have yet to drop ONE CALL! NO CALL DROPS WOW ! I didn't know I could use an ATT phone and NOT drop a call.. This phone has been a pleasure to deal with.. Apple should stick to building computers.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent keyboard. Phone features are good - I can hear others well and they can hear me excellently. Screen is better than I expected. MUCH faster than reviews led me to believe. 
Cons:. A bit heavy. Battery takes longer to charge than previous phones (might be defective battery, I'll check with AT&#38;T). The speaker phone volume could be better. 
Summary:. I've had a bunch of phones, including several Blackberries. At home, we also have iPhones (3GS and 4). I needed to get the Torch for work because the IT department only supports Blackberries. Reading negative reviews, I thought this meant my only choice would be an inferior product (my last phone was a BB Tour, and while it had its pros, the browser was very weak).. Boy, was I ever wrong. I am actually very impressed with the Torch. The device is faster than I expected, the screen is actually not bad at all, and the keyboard is simply amazing. BB 6 works well, although I'm still learning all the features. The browser is much much much better than on previous BB's. Also, the phone features are good. People tell me they can hear me very well, and I can hear them fine. My only complaint on this score is that the speaker function should be louder. I use it while driving, and my previous Tour had better speaker volume.. I'm still playing around with the device (only had it for a week and it has a lot of features). Haven't used the camera/video camera enough to really judge, and still playing around with apps. Also, need to see why the battery takes so long to charge (this happened to me before with another phone; replacing the battery fixed the problem, maybe same situation). But, overall, I am very pleased with this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great touch-screen navigation. Beautiful display. Plays iTunes files.. 
Cons:. Not all apps available on previous Blackberry devices are available yet.. 
Summary:. Yes, it's trendy to bash Blackberry these days. Yes, the launch of the Torch was somewhat botched. But this smart phone still rocks. If you need to be able to send lengthy emails, edit Office documents, listen to music, watch videos, and browse the web and you won't find a better option.. 

$$;
Pros:. Physical keyboard. Optical trackpad. Battery Life better than most touch phones. Blackberry Internet Service. Call quality. Easy transfer of email accounts, apps, contacts, calender, notes from previous BB. Solid Build. Browser is as good as everyone elses. 
Cons:. Device can be a bit laggy at times depending on what's open. Call quality and battery life is not as good as my BB Curve. A lot of crapware that needed to be hidden and or deleted. 
Summary:. I was leary about jumping on the new Torch because of all the negative prepress. My ATT contract had been up for 2 months and I was waiting to see and hear more about the Torch. Thankfully, I went with my gut and got the Torch instead of an iPhone or a Droid device and I'm glad I did. Why? I need a solid, reliable communications, note taking, email device. Blackberry's have and are the best at that bar none. The physical keyboard is a no brainer for quick and accurate typing and the Torch's is about the best out there. I like the responsive, clicky feedback. I am pleasantly surprised how well the optical trackpad works with the touchscreen too. It's very responsive and accurate. It is a lot smoother for scrolling, selecting and "clicking" on links than my fingers. With the keyboard open, you can type accurately with one hand and with the trackpad you can move about the screen with one hand. The trackpad used in tandem with the touchscreen is a really efficient way to navigate, highlight, select and browse. Yes, the screen res, the GUI's not as slick and the processing power are not on par with the others. I think RIM understands that the BB's core strength lies with it being an excellent communications/enterprise messenging device,kept those core strengths and improved upon them. The others are crappy phones with poor battery life while good at games, music and general fluffy stuff. I'm getting two full days on a single charge with moderate browsing, no music, no vids, no game playing and wifi off most of the time. Guess I'm all work and not much play with my phone. That is a far cry from 4-5 days on my old Curve however. The larger screens on these devices are the power hogs on these devices. The single largest user gripe with the BBs had to have been the browser. The previous native BB browser just plain sucked. I had been using Opera Mini on my Curve and it was OK, but a heck of a lot better than the BB browser. The new browser is as good as any out there and a total relief from the previous browsers. It was torture browsing. The Torch is a rock solid device that has it's core competencies down pat and addressed the more serious shortcomings with adequate improvements. The Torch is a great productivity tool and a decent gadget. The Droids and iphones are great gadgets but decent to poor productivity tools.. 

$$;
Pros:. Peerless messaging support. Exquisite construction. Vastly improved web browsing and media support. Physical keyboard. 
Cons:. Not as sexy as iPhone or Android. App support ok but not great. Sluggish touchscreen response.. 
Summary:. I had been eagerly awaiting this phone's release, and then was prepared to be disappointed after reading the less than stellar reviews.. Although I was planning to wait and see if Verizon would finally get the iPhone, my phone recently had a near death experience, which sent me to the AT&#38;T store.. The Torch is my 5th Blackberry over the last 7 years. I've had a Blueberry (7230), two 8700's and a Curve 8300. Nearly all of my friends and family have the iPhone so I've used them a lot. It's a fantastic device but I've felt that for how I use my phone (messaging and phone calls) the Blackberry is more efficient and easier to use. After an hour in the AT&#38;T store trying pretty much every phone they had I went on Amazon and ordered the Torch the next day.. The construction is gorgeous. The combination of the soft touch rubber back, chrome finish front and glass screen makes it feel like it should come in a box that says Bulgari rather than Blackberry. The slider action is rock solid and the general weighting makes it very satisfying to hold in the hand; unlike the iPhone4 which feels like a piece of high grade medical equipment. It feels expensive, unlike the more lightweight (and slightly plasticy) 8700 and 8300. Its heft and solidity recall the 7230 and the Motorola Razr as far as build quality.. After loading a typical selection of apps onto it performance feels fine; except for the touch screen. I think many complaints about sluggish performance may be people using the touch screen; it feels slower to respond to taps and less decisive when you swipe than the iPhone or Android screens I've used. Using the touchpad, the phone feels zippy. Hopefully RIM will address this with a software update; and I expect I just need to get used to it. But occasionally missed presses or swipes aside it seems far faster than the 8300 or the 8700 (or the Storm) ever were. I'm sure if you have a gazillion apps open it slows down, but now thanks to iOS4 so does the iPhone.. There has been much moaning and groaning about the `low' resolution screen. While the screen on the Torch is no Retina Display I put it side by side with my iPod Touch and was hard pressed to tell the difference. Text and graphics look good; although at times it seems the OS doesn't take full advantage of the color depth of the display. For those of us who do not aim jeweler's loupes at our phones it's a perfectly nice screen.. I'm not a fan of touchscreen keyboards; and many people I know who have switched miss the physical keyboard. The Torch keyboard is similar in design to recent Curves and the Bolds, but smaller, flatter, and set deep in the device (thanks to the slider) so it takes a little getting used to; but after an hour spent typing emails on the competition think it's still the best slider keyboard out there.. Messaging support is, as to be expected, peerless. The unified inbox and notifications rock; it's nice to be able to see everything in one place and not have to go digging around in separate apps for different kinds of messages and the latest calls and appointments. You can Compose Emails, SMS, MMS, and IMs from the inbox, and if you enable social feeds Twitter, Facebook and MySpace as well.. App support is spotty; if your idea of smartphone nirvana is having pages and pages of apps, get thee to an iPhone (or Android device). But the basic OS is very richly featured; and I'm always surprised at the number of apps that are available. The App world however, could be better and the apps themselves seem to be getting better and better.. The Webkit browser is 10,000 times better than the old Blackberry browser; if you use the mobile web at all on a current Blackberry the improvement alone is worth the upgrade. Thank you RIM for hearing our cries.. The voice dialing seems improved over the Curve; especially in my car. Also it's nice to be able to get to the phone app with a single touch of a physical button from anywhere.. I've used the Curve on the AT&#38;T network in LA and NY for three years; and while it's not perfect it seems that Blackberries perform vastly better than iPhones on the same network.. I've always said, if you use your phone for media and apps, get an iPhone. If you use it for phone calls and messaging, get a Blackberry. I think that's still true; but the gap is narrowing a bit. The Torch and the new OS 6 bring vastly improved web browsing, social networking and media support to the table. It's not the new hot kid on the block (Android), or a BMW-like app machine (iPhone) but it's very good at many things.. I can see people wanting the Bold for the better battery life and slightly larger keyboard or the Curve for the smaller size, but almost anybody else who uses their phone as a tool to get stuff done would be hard pressed to find a nicer phone than the Blackberry Torch.. 

$$;
Pros:. Optical Keypad, Icon positioning, touch screen, finger minipulation is very crisp, optical mouse is extremely accurate and you really feel in control (no more sticky track balls that freeze). The slider keyboard is very tight, keys, very responsive.. 
Cons:. Google Maps and Slacker Radio freeze. Sometimes you have to take the battery out and re-boot.. Also, this phone will not accept Pandora Music. My bold and I had a love affair with this program. I miss it greatly.. I miss the bigger BOLD from ATT.. 
Summary:. I would recommend this phone hands down for any person in business that requires a business phone. Let's face it folks...the I Phone is a cool play toy for amusement, the droid...still trying to figure that thing out...This TORCH...simply torches those phones for the complete suite of Business, Pleasure and Personal. Your email is rockin, your web browsing is very cool, the real keyboard is absolutely responsive and easy on the fingers and eyes. For the price break of 199 flat rate with contract...no brainer. This phone is fun and the Talk Quality is superior to my BOLD. Friends were even asking if I was calling from a different phone because they could hear me as crisp as a ruffle straight from the bag.. 

$$;
Pros:. OS 6 along with touch interface and social networking greatly improve upon the current needs of people who are always connected and on the go.. 
Cons:. More on the heavy side. Qwerty keyboard is on the smaller side but functional.. 
Summary:. This is the best blackberry I have owned. Fast, smooth interface and I love the way it integrates social networking sites. Finally a blackberry which is current and able to keep up!. 

$$;
Pros:. user friendly touchscreen,good keyboard and best email on the market. 5 mp camera and a user intuitive touch screen, easy social networking notifications. 
Cons:. app store is not up to snuff yet, lack of slingplayer, ebay and other apps (not compatible with os6). 
Summary:. I have used both the iphone and the bold together for 2 years, this is the first phone that i would consider giving up my iphone for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome keyboard and killer email while featuring a plethora of new features including a proper touchscreen, upgraded 5 megapixel camera and the highly anticipated BlackBerry Torch 6 operating system.. 
Cons:. This phone was built for AT&#38;T and will launch exclusively with AT&#38;T in the United States, and internationally on other GSM carriers.. 
Summary:. Only with AT&#38;T... - the first BlackBerry Torch 9800 with a touchscreen, slide keyboard, and BlackBerry 6 OS. For people who prefer the style with which BlackBerry Smartphones get things done, BlackBerry 6 OS Torch is the best BlackBerry operating system to date by far. After booting up a BlackBerry Torch device for the first time you'll automatically be whisked into the Setup Wizard which has undergone a major overhaul. On the BlackBerry Torch, clicking on the Continue button from the initial Welcome to BlackBerry screen takes you into a brief video tutorial that shows you how to navigate the homescreen and use gestures. While an improved setup experience is welcome, the first BIG BlackBerry 6 change you'll notice that really impacts the everyday use of the phone is the new homescreen. While the changes are subtle at first glance (it still looks like a BlackBerry) there are quite a few things going on here other than the new coat of paint on the icons (which do look pretty sweet in my opinion). In addition to the application shortcuts, the BlackBerry Torch 6 homescreen experience also features are AWESOME!!!!. From there, the main Setup screen has been partitioned into three sections: Setup, Personalization and Help &#38; Tutorials. The Setup section should ensure new BlackBerry users are ready to rock and roll on their new phone as soon as they hit the device homescreen, and I hope the Personalization section means we'll see less BlackBerry owners rocking the default ringtones and wallpapers (BlackBerry Torch 6 includes a whole bunch of new ringtones and alert sounds to boot!).. BlackBerry Torch 6 gives off the impression that the operating system before you is a lot bigger than the physical piece of glass you're looking at. Perhaps the most valuable homescreen improvement made to BlackBerry Torch 6 is the addition of Universal Search. It really has fundamentally changed the way I use my BlackBerry. When you touch and hold down on the display, the pop-up menu displays the most popular options. Long story short, the BlackBerry browser no longer sucks. Instead of thinking apps, apps, apps, sites, sites, sites I really just think people and news. BlackBerry Torch 6 is far and away the best BlackBerry OS to date.. This is Billy Amato in NYC. 

$$;
Pros:. * Best sliding mechanism (super-smooth) I have ever felt in a mobile device. * For enterprise customers, gives smartphone &#38; touch-screen functionality w/ legendary (ask Saudi Arabia) BlackBerry security. * Very good physical keypad. * Great battery life. 
Cons:. * BlackBerry App Store is still behind the momentum leaders (Apple &#38; Android) (but time will tell...perhaps it will be more business-focused). * Form factor still on the large side (but still smaller than an EVO 4G, for example). 
Summary:. REAL REVIEW- have actually used one. * Bottom line, I like the Torch a lot.. * Not super groundbreaking, but brings a refreshing touch to BlackBerry options.. - Believe this will be a big hit with enterprise customers as well as those who like the utility of the BlackBerry. (Security, battery life, enterprise-email-friendly plus enough of the new breed of smartphone functionality). * BlackBerry 6 OS is a big step up. * Very solid feel typical of BlackBerry. * Best sliding mechanism (super-smooth) I have ever felt in a mobile device. * Responsive touchscreen. * Not as "cool" as Android or iPhone, but that's not typically part of a BlackBerry user's m.o.. Rating: 4 of 5. 

$$;
Pros:. everything about it is great. 
Cons:. tends to freeze and be slow at times. 
Summary:. best blackberry yet hands down. 

$$;
Pros:. 1.) The slider mechanism is slides smooth and is sturdy.. 2.) Touch screen response is very receptive.. 3.) Blackberry finally has a decent browser.. 4.) Phone is very stylish and built well.. 5.) Camera is 5mp with flash.. 6.) Price of $199. 
Cons:. 1.) Browser can be sluggish at times.. 2.) Blackberry App World is still far behind competiiton, and the torch does not support Pandora yet.. 3.) Battery lfe is poor.. 4.) Only store apps on phone memory.. 5.) Screen resolution could be better.. 
Summary:. I have had this phone for a couple days now, and it is a good phone for the price. The phone has a touch screen, track pad, and full slide down keyboard for easy functioning. It is nice to have all thee options, becasue if you don't want to use the touch screen there is the track pad and full keyboard, (like the bold 9700). The new operatng system (blackberry 6.0) is amazing, very easy to use and flow through. There are some things that could have been better, but the phone is well built and it is one of the better touch screens I have used. The slide moves very well withou any resistance, very sturdy and well built. The slide out keyboard is just like any other blackberry, very easy to use. The resolution in the screen is poor compared to my last blackberry (Bold 9000). Blackberry finally came out with a decent browser , but it can be sluggish at times. Blackberry App World is still way behind , and the torch does not support Pandora Radio yet. Apps can only be stored on the phones memory , not on the micro sd card that they provide.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Nice Keyboard and fast typing.. - good to handle. - good quality. - longer battery than iPhone but done after 1.5 days if used for business. - nicer calendar than the iPhone. - changable battery (vs. iPhone). 
Cons:. - touchpad not responsive. - getting slow with more and more apps. - few apps. - blackberry e-mail without support of folders and not syncing with online account. - touchscreen not as nice as the iPhone. - 5MP camera makes very bad pictures. 
Summary:. I changed to the BB Torch as my iPhone ran out of battery after not even a day. Touchsceen nicer on the iPhone, graphics better, too. Plus I could not write without mistake on the iPhone. After 10 days, I returned my BB Torch and went back to my iPhone 3GS.. The screen of the iPhone is nicer and with good settings, the battery life is longer.. I can only compare to the iPhone.. If you are used to BB it is for sure the best BB.. A lot of Pros and a lot of Cons... decide yourself.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, great email and text messaging features.. 
Cons:. Battery life, even when on standby and not used for several hours, my phone battery does not last even one day. Even when the phone is shut off, for some reason the battery keeps discharging.. 
Summary:. My daughter has the i phone 4 for a month now and I did compare the black berry to the i phone. I'm glad that I bought the blackberry, all I need...since I'm not a fan of all the available apps.. Updated. on Oct 22, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. innovative. 
Cons:. device does not feel solid - after one drop - it is rattling and is loose. front screen needs a lot of time to get things where you want them. browser gives a fauly reading - size 20 font. slow response time. screen typing useless with keyboard. 
Summary:. An OK phone if you are wanting something innovative. If you are after speed and ease of use - dont get this phone. If you are looking for an iPhone comparison - dont - this is a blackberry - and the Bold is easier to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. - touch screen, trackpad, and physical keyboard all in one. - no sure-press touchscreen. - looks great. - solid build quality. 
Cons:. - horrendous screen resolution (WTH blackberry??). - touch screen is not as refined as others. - unlock button is too easy to unintentionally press. - doesn't feel as "complete" as other blackberrys. 
Summary:. I had this phone for a day and decided to take it back. I had a 9700 before this and decided to give it a try because of the larger touch screen, webkit browser, and newer operating system.. I wouldn't say the phone is bad overall, it just doesn't feel as "unified" as my 9700. The OS is clearly designed to work with touch and just-keyboard phones. The menu structure is a cluster and is inconsistent. I hate the fact that I can't press the blackberry button to access my list of apps and options, etc.. The most disappointing thing was the screen resolution. Turning this phone on for the first time was like going 2 years back in time. The screen resolution is horrendously low. A 360 x 480 resolution on a screen that big? C'mon RIM!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice Build Quality. Keyboard is nice. 
Cons:. Can not set up GMail account right out of the box "Invalid User Name or Password" No excuse for this on a high end device like a Blackberry. 
Summary:. I bought a brand new Torch on Sunday at the AT&#38;T store and right out of the box when trying to set up my email account on GMail, I kept getting "Invalid User name or Password" I tried everything and could not get it to work.. I am an IPhone user and setting up GMail using and exchange server was a breeze. This is a bunch of BS. I was so excited on going back to Blackberry to get away from push email on the IPhone 4 and this really let me down. I am a pretty Tech savoy person and have never had that much of a problem getting my GMail account set up on ANY other device.. To make matters worse, I took the device back to get a refund and they charged me a 35.00 restocking fee for something they new did not work when I was at the store the previous day. I changed my plan back to the IPhone 4 and now I least have a working device to access my GMail account.. Well RIM , you let me down. 

$$;
Pros:. blackberry service. stylish blackberry looks. 
Cons:. - very poor screen resolution - BLACKBERRY WHAT THE HELL WERE U THINKING?. - Weak Processor compared to other Smart phones. - can only store apps on phone memory. - Poor recording quality. - blackberry apps is way behind. 
Summary:. this review is a FAIL !!!!!!!! I agree with MrHumble1. - too much brand value, less emphasis on the hardware. Pity most people will see this as a must have blackberry accessory rather than a cutting edge smartphone. .. i'd go with the HTC desire or Iphone 4 (if you dont mind the ugly bumper which gets rid of the grip of death).. 

$$;
Pros:. Email, BBM, Physical Keyboard,. 
Cons:. Screen Resolution, Slow OS / Web Browsing Experience, Build Quality, Sound Quality, App Selection, No HD Video Recording, Camera,. 
Summary:. I was having some issue with reception where I worked; I have an iPhone 4 and was advised by an AT&#38;T rep to try out the Torch as it supposably has a better radio and should perform better than the iPhone 4.. After about 24 hours of having the Torch, I am glad to say I am back on my iPhone 4. The Torch was a serious step back; the phone felt 3 years older. The screen resolution was very poor by 2010 standards; in 2008 it might have been fine, but seriously it felt like I went from an HD LCD flat panel to a Standard Definition Big Box TV.. Web browsing on the Torch is a mixed bag. If you are going from a BlackBerry Bold 9700 to the Torch or even the Storm to a Torch, you will probably be happy. But if you even try an iPhone 3GS, 4 or Captivate, you would find that the web browsing experience of the Torch is poor by comparison. The browser is slow and the clarity of the web is not very good. I also was frustrated at the number of web sites that get thrown into a mobile view only; the iPhone, Palm, and Android phone's do a much better job at giving the user the "full" web experience right off the bat, without being forced into a mobile view. Just try the New York Times on the Torch vs. the iPhone or Palm Pre and you will see what I mean.. I really liked the Physical keyboard of the Torch; that was definitely a great addition to this phone. However, I wish that RIM spent more time on the virtual keyboard as it was very difficult to use. I only became a pain when I was in landscape mode and wanted to type in a web address.. As I previously mentioned, I wanted to try this phone out as I heard it had a better radio than the iPhone 4. I can honestly say that I could not tell a difference. I dropped calls in the same locations as the iPhone 4; however, the sound quality was horrible on the Torch. Sounded like I was talking through tin foil. I thought maybe it was just a defective unit; I went to AT&#38;T and had it replaced with another Torch. As I placed a call 5 minutes later, I realized it was just the phone. I found that to be the largest annoyance with the Torch.. The build quality was also questionable; the optical trackpad was loose and not functioning on the first unit I tried; I used the touch screen so it wasn't a huge deal, but it was a pain for some things. The second unit I had, the screen portion of the slider was loose and didn't open properly. It just felt cheap and not well designed. But that is just my opinion.. App Selection on the Torch is poor. If you don't need to have 3D games or wide selection of apps, then this won't bother you. But for me, this was a big deal. Even the apps that they did have (MLB at Bat and Bloomberg) were fairly poor in comparison to Android and iOS versions.. I was definitely excited to try out the new BlackBerry OS 6.0. I found it to be good and bad; I liked ability to quickly access notifications and turn on and off Wi-Fi. This is an area that Apple really needs to spend time with to improve. However, other areas were completely frustrating. I felt like the "simplified" menu system was somewhat frustrating as I could not find certain things (not finding a way to change the web from automatically viewing web pages in mobile was frustrating). I also found the OS to simply get slow and bog down at times.. While I don't really rely on a Smartphone camera as a substitute for a good point and shoot, I did find that the camera in my iPhone 4 was substantially better than the Torch. HD video recording in the iPhone was much better than the Torch and the picture quality was also better. I will say that the Torch has more options to play with as opposed to the iPhone 4, but it was not better by any means.. I know many people reading this review may say that you can't compare this to an iPhone 4. I disagree. When smartphone's like the Torch or Captivate come out with a Webkit browser and touch interface, they are essentially trying to replicate the performance of the iPhone that originated this experience back in 2007. The reality is that the iPhone 4 and Torch are both smartphone's on the AT&#38;T network that go for roughly the same price. So yes, I do think it is imperative to compare and contrast the two. In my opinion, if you have the option, I would buy a Captivate or iPhone 4 before a Torch any day of the week.. I took back the Torch after 24 hours of use and am glad to be back on my iPhone 4. If you are a BlackBerry fanatic and want a better web browsing experience than say a 9700 or Storm, this may be a good option. But if you are new to Smartphone's, make sure you try out the other options out or wait for Windows Phone 7 before you look at a Torch.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good build quality, improved OS/UI, decent battery life.. 
Cons:. Touch screen often insensitive to touch, display not crisp, sometimes sluggish response, limited software availability.. 
Summary:. I tried to evaluate the 9800 without comparison to other phones (not an easy task) and found it inadequate, to say the least. I could live with the less-than-brilliant display, and even the occasional sluggishness isn't too bad, but here's the killer: I touch the screen to execute a command (say "Submit") and nothing happens even after several attempts. I end up having to abandon the screen and use the touch pad to point to the location then click the touch pad to accomplish executing the command. This is unacceptable to me. I read similar complaints, so I don't think I have a defective unit.. The other killer is the limited/expensive available apps, many of which end up not working correctly (or at all) with the 9800.. It looks to me that this phone was rushed to market 2/3rd baked both hardware and software-wise and it is disappointing. Mine is going back to the vendor.. If this is RIM's best, they are in deep trouble.... 

$$;
Pros:. Good web browsing, Wireless N, great camera, larger screen and better options for AT&#38;T users. Better media sync features. Refined and more sensible user interface. Still a great messaging device.. 
Cons:. Sluggish performance, bluetooth stereo issues, so-so display, bulky. Way behind iPhone and Andriod platforms, surviving based on enterprise customers who cannot migrate easily.. 
Summary:. This is my third Blackberry, after Bold 9000 and 9700. Moving from my 9700 which randomly rebooted on me, I must say so far, this is a good improvement, by way of just occassional freezes for 3-5 seconds. The hard keyboard is reasonably OK, not as good as Bold 9000. On screen keyboard works well in landscape mode. I am still trying to figure out the auto correct feature, so far it's causing more disruption than being helpful.. The user interface is much better compared to earlier generations. I played with Storm 2 earlier and this is a definite improvement over it. What upset me most is the sluggishness. I wish RIM could have used the newer 1 GHz ARM CPUS. The display is better, but no where close to iPhne or some of the Andriod phones. I am still unable to play Bluetooth stereo on my Pioneer car stereo which worked flawlessly with Bold 9700 and other cell phones.. Lastly, its bulky! I wish it was a bit sleeker. But I guess we corporate users are not much of choosers. I could only wish some day I will get approved to use Exchange Activesync for iPhone.. Updated. on Aug 28, 2010.

Pros:. Lightweight.. It's a touch phone training pad at best. 
Cons:. It is a touch phone training pad at best. The Apps are terrible and no Pandora radio? Slaker is ok, but it's not Pandora, also no NFL Live app.. Most of the apps are useless.. 
Summary:. What brilliant programmer did not add the \ to the keyboard??? And there is no keyboard app that you can download that lets you get it!! I am going to return it bc in order to get my my works network my code and sign on I need to enter the \ which the touch and hard keyboard do not have. HELLO??? Can someone tell me why? Can this be pushed out in a release or upgrade? If so, will it take forever?. 

$$;
Pros:. Good battery life. Can open attachments within e-mails. Faster internet.. 
Cons:. FREEZES UP. This happens frequently and the duration seems like a lifetime. The phone covers that are made for this device are nearly IMPOSSIBLE to take off so that you can take the battery out. GPS rarely works on this device. DROPS CALLS. 
Summary:. The first day that I got this device, (and I am not kidding), the car charger got stuck inside my car. I had to drive back to the AT&#38;T store. It took 4 reps 30 minutes to get it out and they exchanged the charger telling me not to align the pins on the charger with the metal prongs inside the charging compartment! Within 2 weeks the outside humidity fried my phone-THAT'S RIGHT-just humidity (and that's with the cover on)! The AT&#38;T reps exchanged the phone because they did not find direct water damage. My replacement Torch seems less sensitive but freezes up for long periods of time and I can't get the cover off to reset the phone. FORGET about paying for GPS service on this device. It is just not reliable. Internet speed is good. The battery lasts longer than on the Curve. The touch screen sometimes works and sometimes does not ; so you have to rely on a recessed keyboard that is diffcult to use due to the fact that it is recessed. If you want a great phone-keep looking.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good signal strenght (reception). 
Cons:. Battery: Replaced after 60 days and can't get through a full day of normal business use. Locks up and requires battery to be pulled (1-2 times per day), ring tone often does not work so missed calls. 3-5 minute restart delay. 
Summary:. This is the least reliable phone I have every owned. abig disappointment from my previous Blackberry Curve or iPhone. Too many missed calls to count due to the device locking up without warning. The only way you know is when you realize you have not had a call or email for hours. Pull the battery and after a 4-5 minute wait you get all your missed calls, voice mails and texts. Asd a business person, I need a phone I can count on and unfortuantly, the Blackberry Torch is not it.. 

$$;
Pros:. qwerty keyboard, nice weight. 
Cons:. slow, freezes up, screen poor quality resolution, screen unresponsive. 
Summary:. I recently sent RIM an email letting them know I am finished promoting their products to my friends. After holding out with a Bold 9700 and hoping the Torch would match a Droid or Iphone in excitement, I have had enough. Like other people said this phone is great for 2008. RIM is so far out of the game for smartphones, they should make an Android Blackberry. Why cant someone at RIM purchase an Iphone and a Droid phone and see what a great smartphone is all about.. 

$$;
Pros:. Better than both Storms, good phone from 2007. I think as far as the phones casing and look its great. Keyboard is ok.. 
Cons:. In mins of turning this phone on it froze numerous times. Im told its not always freezing I'm just not used to how slow the phone is. I had to pull the battery twice. the touch screen is unresponsive very choppy.. 
Summary:. I'M SO DISAPOINTED. Previous exclusive BB users may like this phone because they don't no any better. RIM come on the rest of us expected much better. I was expecting an Iphone, EVO, Droid X, or Galaxy S power house phone. At least RIM could've put a reset button on the phone some where so you can reboot the phone with out a battery pull. Choppy unresponsive screen and a underpowerd processor is not the way to win people over. Bottom line is, RIM go check out the competition b4 you put out a product that is behind the times.. 

$$;
Pros:. Better resolution than old screen; apps; media.. 
Cons:. Balky software; small keypad - both manual and electronic; intuitive typing option interferes with typing speed; poor battery life; non-responsive touchscreen.. 
Summary:. But for the apps, I much prefer my manual, scroll and point Blackberry of old. The latter was much more functional and ergonomically tailored. Even the typing on the old manual Blackberry was faster than the Torch. What is most annoying, however, is waiting on your touch screen to unfreeze itself as you attempt to go to your e-mail, IMs, or apps. So far, the $249 price (sans tax) has in no way been justified.. 

$$;
Pros:. ok when it works.. 
Cons:. RIM has no idea why the phone stalls and continues to point the finger at other well known apploications. 
Summary:. Not one of RIM's better phones. Disappointing support. 

$$;
Pros:. nice physical design, feels good in the hand. 
Cons:. Internet &#38; data mobile access fails, AT&#38;T points their finger at RIM, RIM points back at AT&#38; T, yanking the battery does not work as in previous Blackberries, only after a total wipe of all data did it start working again.\. 
Summary:. it's no where near a droid or Iphone for stability and I am tired of being teased by users of both. 

$$;
Pros:. Except for cheap button cover that falls off, the phone feels beautifully engineered on the exterior.. 
Cons:. Phone freezes and pauses frequently. Pocket dials even when locked (lock button function is poorly designed and is easily unlocked inadvertently. Often unable to access phone book (does not respond). AT&#38;T would not replace mine with lower model.. 
Summary:. Like driving a slow barge up a fast river of communications, terrible and frequent communications accidents are inevitable. Unfortunately, the phone is all sizzle but a gristly steak. Run back to the Bold. This phone is not ready for prime time yet. AT&#38;T wouldn't replace mine even with the constant error messages, failure and abort messages (and the buttons falling off after 3 days). I'm switching back to the Bold --its a much more stable device. I've been with AT&#38;T for 10 years. And this device, and how poorly they've handled the situations, if why I'm leaving. It would have been better had I just chosen an older model Blackberry --for me and AT&#38;T.. 

$$;
Pros:. large screen, reasonable batter life, combines text messaging. 
Cons:. phone freezes, slow slow slow processor, doesnt delete items, rarely finds gps satteleite.... honestly.. just dont do it.. 
Summary:. First off, I didn't write this review the day the phone came out, I have been using this phone since the first week of september, so I think I have earned the right to say what I have to say. I was hoping the newest software would fix the problems but It definately hasnt. so... here we go. The screen on the blackberry is good. Much bigger than previous blackberry's ( i have had them since the late 90's) Unlike the i phone the battery life is actually really good. In most cases I can make it through the day without having to charge. The real problem is that the phone just doesn?t function properly. Constantly when I am typing I get the egg timer and have to wait for the phone to catch up. A major issue is that, when you delete contacts from your phone book, magically one week later they show back up? I don?t get it. The gps in att nav or tele nav can NEVER find the satellite, it takes up to 30 minutes sometimes to find the satellite????? When you are talking, the phone randomly goes into speaker phone, even if you are holding it away from your face ( ie, not hitting it with your cheek). The touchscreen often gets confused when when browsing and scrolls instead of selecting what you are trying to click on, and my favorite feature of blackberry recognizing a phone number and letting you click on it to dial only works some of the time. I am sooo frustrated with this horrible phone. I tried to give it time for software to fix it.. ( remember I love, love , love blackberry?s , even though they haven?t been really good since the indestructible blue ones.). at any rate. There is not way a bunch of people sat in an office and tested this phone. This is just a sad excuse for race to market and no testing. They clearly aren?t listening to the consumer anymore. Just like the to black ?post it note thing? people want a tablet, not a 7? thing you can palm in your hand. Anyways. I used to love blackberry, now I am left wondering what to do next. Maybe in a year this phone will work, but for now. Run the other way.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice build, keyboard, and push email great for business. 
Cons:. screen is wimpy, a bit slow, interface is not good compared to andriod or iOS. 
Summary:. I had this for two days also owned the storm,curve and bold. The updated software is ok, but compared to the new 2.2 Android and Apple iphone 4 this phone just cannot compete. RIM needs to do a complete overhall on their software and develop a proper app world. Expectations of phone usage has increased. I went back to Verizon and got the Droid X - which blows away Blackberry. I get my email on a timely manner and enjoy surfing the web and using the hotspot with my laptop. All those who praise the blackberry are probably people who really don't understand technology and has never used an iphone or android recently. Things have changed and people need to realize this and stop praising crap technology.. 

$$;
Pros:. Qwerty keyboard. 
Cons:. Processor is very weak. Quality of craftmanship very questionable with the fact mine has a defective screen. Apps are a joke compared to iPhone or Android apps. No Flash support.4 gb memory. Poor screen resolution.. 
Summary:. Blackberry tried to make a phone for business and play and came up with a phone that would have been ok a year ago.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing, it's horrible data services never worked!. 
Cons:. I have had to replace my Torch 5 times with ATT as the BB data portion always went AWOL after accessing a ATT wifi hotspot.. Good bye BB as you "Torched" me one too many times. 
Summary:. I have had to replace my Torch 5 times with ATT as the BB data portion always went AWOL after accessing a wifi hotspot.. Once leaving a ATT wifi spot, it would not re-connect with BB Data services. I was phone one Friday night with BB support in Toronto for 5 hours (and i missed a hot date due to this support call) and after doing a master reset (lost all stored personal data) was able to restore. But, it only lasted a week before it needed replacement .. Finally after replacing 5 times, the ATT Rep admitted the problem and sold me a Samsung Captivate and i haven't looked back since. The Samsung not only is a much better phone, but has so many more attractive applications. The email is not as efficient as BB, but still works well..... Good bye BB as you "Torched" me one too many times. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid build quality. 
Cons:. Slow, laggy UI. Has that feature consistent to all Blackberries, the battery pull.. 
Summary:. When I got my Droid X for personal use, I was amazed by the features, screen, &#38; speed. When I got my Torch for work, I was amazed by the same items, but only due of the lack of them. Slow, laggy, worthless screen just begin to describe this phone. If your a long term Blackberry user you'll be happy with this mediocre phone, if you've used anything else in the last 5 years, you'll be highly disappointed at Rim's lack of effort.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome phone. 
Cons:. THE TORCH HAS A MAJOR GLITCH.. 
Summary:. THE TORCH HAS A MAJOR GLITCH. THE PHONE HAS A PROBLEM WHERE THE DATA STOPS WORKING (BBM, INTERNET). BB IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND I'VE BEEN TOLD BY ATT THAT IT COULD TAKE 3 MONTHS FOR RIM TO FIX. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE AT ALL COATS UNTIL THE UPDATE IS ISSUED. TRUST ME IVE HAD 3 OF THEM ALREADY AND IM SWITCHING TO AN IPHONE ASAP.
