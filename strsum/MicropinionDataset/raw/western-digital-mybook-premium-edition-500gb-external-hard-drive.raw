Pros:. Fast, easy to use and quiet. 
Cons:. Setting up takes time. 
Summary:. Once this machine is set up and running, it requires almost no attention. When you install it into the computer or laptop just switch it to NTFS format and you are ready to go!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast when reformatted to NTFS. 
Cons:. Slow as standard.. 
Summary:. It is a matter of seconds to change between the slow FAT and the fast NTFS - so you have to wonder why any manufacturer would ship it with it set to perform slowly as standard, knowing that most magazine reviewers would just take it out of the box and write a the review based on the slow setting.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quiet, Power Button, Reliable, Backup Software. 
Cons:. Crapware; price. 
Summary:. My 3rd My Book from Western Digital, and works like a charm. I love the on/off button, it runs very quietly, looks great, and haven't had a single problem with it outside of normal Vista woes. Opened it, plugged it in, and recognized immediately. backup software works great, letting me choose specific files, drives, or folders, that I want to backup. Unlike some harddrives I've had, this one only "spins" when I'm accessing it, saving considerable life. Speed is great, haven't had any problems from any of my books in 2 years. Though the "premium" is a little pricey. Look for it on sale/clearance. If only it came blank without the couple of crapware bits.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to install, doesn't take up much space on my computer desk, maintenance free.. 
Cons:. I really haven't found anything I don't like about it yet.. 
Summary:. I tell everyone I know about how great it is to have one of these, it is a bottomless pit to store information in for what I am using it for. I think it's awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. Both Firewire and USB connections. 
Cons:. Comes formatted for FAT32. 
Summary:. I bought this drive to store my digital video files on and it handles this function admirably.. The only complaint I have about this drive is that it comes formatted to FAT32 in order to be compatible with older versions of Windows, such as 98SE. I'm running Windows XP Pro.. The instructions for formatting the drive to NTFS leave something to be desired, as it is DESTRUCTIVE. It is better to reformat the drive using the Windows Command Line method, as it is non-destructive. That is, if you already have some files on this drive and you forgot to format it to NTFS, using the command line method it will not erase your data already on the drive.. The drive is daisy chained via the firewire port to another generic external drive, and finally to my digital video camera. Though I was initially concerned about this, I have not experienced any reliability issues doing this. It all plays nicely together.. I highly recommend this drive to anyone looking to boost their storage capabilities.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap, fast, good build quality. 
Cons:. Large, extra chords, some versions are loud. 
Summary:. For what it is, the 500GB MyBook is a great product. Its cheap, fast, and provides tons of storage. The only problem I can see with it is that portable hard drives are now up to 160gb, and they are much smaller with no need for additional power aside from usb. Unless you really need the extra space, I would avoid cluttering your desk with the extra mass and chords.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks cool, turns off when computer turns off, durable, pretty quiet, led in middle is pretty sweet (inner tells capacity, outer tells activity), stackable. 
Cons:. Pricey, tries to tell you that you need to install some software. 
Summary:. I bought the MyBook 500GB roughly 6 months ago, and since then i have done nothing but cram it full of video and music files. It has transferred content for over 10 hours straight several times. It has also been dropped from a height of approximatly 1 foot and still worked perfectly after.. Overall this product is well designed and its only flaw i see is the price...but like anything that will go down with time. 

$$;
Pros:. iPodesque Design, Capaity and Usage Lights, Easy "Plug and Play" Use, Firewire and USB Connectivity. 
Cons:. Expensive for an ExHDD, First Uses are Choppy, Power Down Problems. 
Summary:. I have been on the market for an external hard drive for the past year or so, and after hearing that Western Digital was releasing this external hard drive, I quickly pre-ordered one for myself. While I was a little frustrated at the beginning with the drive due to minor issues with the system (would not power on, would not be recognized by my CPU, and WMP 10 functionallity issues), I am extremely pleased with how well it has worked since then.. First of all, let me say that this is an amazing looking device. The entire device is lined with morse code holes. This gives the external drive its "book" like feature. It is undoubtedly the most best looking external hard drive on the market today, and it is really nice to have on any desk in your home or office. It also is very small, and fits in even the smallest of spaces, which is also a very well thought out feature for this drive. Of course it is not pocket sized, but for such a large capacity drive, it is very small.. Another feature I really liked with this drive is its two-ringed capacity and use lights. This helps you know how much memory, first of all, is left on the drive, which can be very useful, and also lets you know if you have power and/or connectivity with your computer. While they may seem very useless, there are actually a very nice feature to have.. The drive also funcitions very nicely, for the most part. For those of you listening and planning to buy this drive, listen to this very important advice. The two rings also double as a power button for the device, so BEFORE YOU PLUG YOUR HARD DRIVE INTO YOUR CPU, WHETHER BY USB OR FIREWIRE, TURN ON THE HARD DRIVE BY PRESSING THIS BUTTON!!!! Otherwise, functionallity is very lack-luster, and can be very slow and unbearable. The drive has a hard time to spin-up with computer start-up, so this is very important. If you do this, however, you will find this hard drive to work perfectly. This drive is also formatted at FAT32, which is a great file format, but personally, I recommend changing the file system to a NTFS format. It, at least for me, seems to run faster and function better with this type of format.. This drive is also extremely fast when it comes to the "import and export" of information and files. As a person who loves music, photos, and video editing, I can tell you how fast this drive really is.. This is really my perspective of this drive. As I stated, it is a bit pricey, but is very much worth it. While first uses, as I stated, can be a bit choppy until your computer really starts to recognize this drive as another hard drive, it really funtions very nicely. I am very pleased with Western Digital's MyBook, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new external hard drive for their laptop or desktop computer system.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best looking HD, alot of storage space. 
Cons:. A bit Slow :\. 
Summary:. i love this product, i copy all my movies over to it and i can take it any where. also very stylish when you compare to other external HD's.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well, it's 500GB.. has dual interface... and had 2 FW ports to allow a chain. Good for computers with limited ports.. 
Cons:. The blue light on the front won't turn off.. Ever... 
Summary:. I don't know what to say.. It is a great hard drive, it holds stuff... 

$$;
Pros:. Simple, easy, quiet, just works.. 
Cons:. Speed not fantastic.. 
Summary:. I just purchased my third WD MyBook 500GB drive. I have had no problems with these drives, I plug them in, reformat them for Mac (OS X) and am copying files to them in minutes. They mount find out of the box on a Mac, I just want the Mac file system, not MS-DOS (or whatever it comes formatted as). The price on this drive is usually great when on sale, and it is so quiet (passive cooling?) that I am slowly replacing my collection of external drives with fans added. I am not using these for video streaming or high-demand use, so I have not really taxed them. They are storing a file archive that is accessed sporatically. They power on and off automatically just fine with my Mac. They are not speedsters, but are fine for the price, ease of setup, and low noise. I do think they could use some sort of base to improve airflow, but I may be paranoid on cooling.. Lastly, the green light on my oldest one (6 months old?) is significanly faded compared to newer ones, so they don't match - but that is a minor cosmetic beef.. 

$$;
Pros:. cost and Firewire/USB 2.0. 
Cons:. have to install with USB to install firewire driver. 
Summary:. Originally I had the same opinion as the CNET staff about the write speed of the Western Digital "My Book 500GB" external drive. It was sloooowwwww.. Then I noticed that it was shipped formatted as FAT32. I reformatted it as NTFS and the increase in speed was amazing.. Now we will have to see if the product is reliable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, stylish, very quiet operation, easy to use. 
Cons:. WDBackup software does not have system backup and recovery. 
Summary:. Being on the market for an external HD, decided for the WD Mybook PE ( 500GB ) and not regret it. Instalation is a breeze and we only install the bundled software if we want - WDBackup and Google applications. It comes formatted in FAT32 file system, so re-formatting on NTFS is a must.Also, I power the unit in the main button, prior to connect it to the PC and poweroff it also in this main button, prior to unconnect it from the main PC, and operation is fast enough, although I do not care for speed, as I use the external drive only for backups. The WDBackup software,although interesting and complete, lacks the ability to make system backups and recoverys on bootable CD's, which is a shame. Could be shipped with Retrospect Express, as their big brothers Pro versions. Its a very quiet external HD, difficult to hear the hd working - compared to LaCie Brick, which is much noisier. Design wise, it's indeed like a book. When not using it I put it on a shelf, side by side with normal books, and anyone can tell it's an external harddrive. Never had any power failure on it. It works well and get's the job done.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good storage, good price, stylick. 
Cons:. Slow writing, not super-portable. 
Summary:. My pros/cons basically say it all. It stores a good amount (mine's 320 gb) for a good price. It's got a real handy LED light that displays roughly how much space is being uses (OK, so not really handy, but cool nonetheless).. It's somewhat large, so I was worried about taking it with me somewhere, but it's proven quite sturdy so far.. 

$$;
Pros:. Design, small footprint, quiet, cool (running).. 
Cons:. Is slow on sytem back-ups.. 
Summary:. Seems OK to me. I did notice how slow it is to write but to me performance in that area isn't that important. It's quiet, compact, and doesn't throw much heat. Lots of gigs for the $$$ and the bookish design is sharp. Give it a go.. 

$$;
Pros:. the footprint is nice and small. 
Cons:. why use fatfat32. 
Summary:. I dont know how to reformat to ntfs. 

$$;
Pros:. It works- its an external HDD that stores stuff- I put videos, photos and music on it. It's CHEAP too.. 
Cons:. It writes slow and according to plex has some power issue- he must've bought from some refurb co.. 
Summary:. It is my Opinion that These other 2 users have a biased opinion. One has three posts and all are negative (surprise) and the other only has this one post (probably works for WD). This drive works- it does what it is suposed to do. Doesn't do it spectacular but it doesn't have "power" problems either- I bought it at BESTbuy (which I actually h8 going to) for only $199- it writes slow but when I need to watch a video off it it works as fast as my IDE drive. BIG177 is obsessed and possibly a WD employee and Plex woke up on the wrong side of the bed.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's cheap and easy. And the heat it gives off helps heat my house in the winter.. 
Cons:. It's slow and hot--get it an external fan or it'll burn. It takes a while to transfer data--sssslllloooowwww.. 
Summary:. For the price, it's not bad, and we found it fairly easy to network. But it gets too hot, and so we don't leave it on, which is a shame because I'd like to stream the music through the house, and it's a pain to have to drop everything and go upstairs to turn the MyBook on every time I want to stream anything.. 

$$;
Pros:. decent speed, nice looking. 
Cons:. daisy chain problems. 
Summary:. A good drive if you just need one. Windows XP won't recognize the second drive if you try to daisy chain, or even if you try a direct firewire or usb connection. Trying to get support but no response thusfar.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, looks. 
Cons:. FireWire does not daisy chain well. 
Summary:. I am also experiencing problems with daisy chaining other drives via FireWire. I am running Vista Ultimate, with the WD MyBook first in line, then a DVD-RW drive, then another hard drive. Regular disk access works fine, but more intensive tasks, such as running Acronis TrueImage to validate a backup image on the WD MyBook, resulted in continuous clicking and the drive powering down and/or freezing the system. I disconnected the other drives and then everything worked fine, though the drive seems to whine a lot more than my LaCie Porsche drive.. I should add that I had no problems running the daisy chained drives on my old XP system, so maybe the problem is with Vista? Wouldn't be surprising.. 

$$;
Pros:. Styling, capacity, price. 
Cons:. Not compatible with MS Vista. 
Summary:. Just purchased so I can't write a complete review however I was very disappointed to learn that WD is not providing any support for Vista as of today's date (2/14/07), here's the note from WD Support, seems they would have at least something hacked together with such a major release:. Western Digital does not provide technical support or drivers for our products installed under Windows Vista at this time. We will be releasing updated software utilities and drivers for selective Western Digital products in the near future. However, at this time we do not have any ETA on when software or drivers maybe available.". 

$$;
Pros:. when this hard drive is working properly it is great. However, it does not work for long. 
Cons:. Stops working without a valid reason. 
Summary:. I find that every one to two monhts the HD stops working and I have to re-install the software. I use it to back up business files and worry about recovering them. 

$$;
Pros:. Design is good. 
Cons:. Speed was average. 
Summary:. I wasnt impressed with this drive at all, very average speeds, was expecting more from the disk and firewire. Also windows XP reported that the drive needed to be scanned at every boot but scan wouldnt complete. Resolved that by running chkdsk [volume] /f. WD reports a 2 year warranty though when i checked the serial number. So thats good anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Price/Size ratio. 
Cons:. Unreliable, I had to return it.. 
Summary:. I bought one of these at Costco. It died after a few days. I could barely get it back to format and erase sensitive work data before I returned it. I replaced it with a 1TB version which has worked well for a couple of months now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up and use. 
Cons:. Not very fast, crashed on me after 6 months. 
Summary:. A good value, but if you are on the go and need to move around with it, not a great option. Even though I packed it well during travel, it blew up on my last trip home.. Good thing I have most of my data backed up somewhere else.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stylish and quiet. 
Cons:. Speed (it's slow), lack of true Vista Support, WD Support is non-existant. 
Summary:. Sure it looks good and it has fancy lights on the front, but don't be fooled into thinking it works as good as it looks.. The drive is slow and lacks true Vista support. It will work in Vista, but Vista frequently pops up a window informing you of driver compatiblity issues. In addition, the bundled WD Backup software is a joke. It won't run in Advanced mode (in Vista) and when a backup is scheduled, no file changes are detected... kinda defeats the purpose of having a backup drive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap method of backing up information. 
Cons:. just lasted over the warranty time. 
Summary:. This 500 GB drive worked ok for a while, I hardly used it though and just the other day I went to see what I had stored on it. To my dismay, the drive was no where to be found on my system. It had just disappeared, though the drive was on and functioning and plugged into my USB hub as it always has been.. I found by googling 'MyBook Problems' that many people are having this problem with this drive and it seems a lot of people are having the same problem. I've spent about 2 hrs trying various methods I've learned that other people have done that has fixed the problem, but so far anything that has worked for other people to solve their 500 gb Mybook problems have worked for me.. The MYBook is being recognized as a 'USB Mass Storage device' and not a harddrive. I can't access the information on it, and the unit is very noisy, metal clanking sounds. It may be toast, and I hardly ever used the drive that is the bad part.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use &#38; install. 
Cons:. dead. only lasted for just over a year. 
Summary:. easy to use, but slow writes speeds. came home yesterday to hear clicks of death. I ran weekly back ups of my desktop but did have some data on it. lesson learned. I can send in for retrieval but that will run about $1000. I will store it for a while.. 

$$;
Pros:. Worked well while it lasted. 
Cons:. Did not last long. 
Summary:. The external drive was very easy to use and my backup program made weekly backups flawlessly for almost a year. Then suddenly I could not read from the drive anymore, all data was lost. I could not even use it for a while. Then I felt relieved when it came back to life, the system recognized it as an unformatted drive. So I formated it, thinking that what happened was just a fluke and all would be well again. After formating the system was unable to write files to the drive, it is now useless.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very basic operations are easy. 
Cons:. Anything but basic operations is extremely cumbersome. 
Summary:. Got this free with a very nice WD MyBook. This products works well if you have nothing but standard documents on your computer in standard places. The ability to quickly preselect photo / music (long and slow) vs other docs is quite handy.. However, I do a lot with my computer that doesn't fall into WD's predefined backup file types. I need to use the advanced backup feature to avoid uncessary backups. Bizarrely, this feature can remember my file type preferences, but can't remember folders preferences. End result: no quick backup or incremental backup for me.. Details on files: This packs your files into a proprietary format. Backups are a split into multiple files of &lt;= 2GB. Fortunately, the backup created always includes a restore utility, so this is not a problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small footprint. 
Cons:. I have three of these drives and had two die. One was not under warranty so I cracked the case and replaced with a different manufactures drive. The other is being replaced under warranty so am locked into them. I am holding my breath on the third.. 
Summary:. Lasts about 1 year. I have drives from other manufactures that are going strong after 7-8 years. I would not buy a WD drive.. 

$$;
Pros:. The capacity when it works.. 
Cons:. It is undependable.. 
Summary:. Originally purchased it to back up data, photos, music, etc., from an older desk top and thought the constant connectivity and data issues we had with it were due to the USB 1.0, but no. Even with a newer Sony Vaio it does not function consistently. Frustrating.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large capacity. 
Cons:. Slow, CPU hog, Backup software impossible to remove. Support is awful.. 
Summary:. Do not buy this product unless you enjoy fighting with your computer, searching for hours on how to uninstall FREE software, get useless support from a large company and loose access to large home video files when trying to transfer them to a new HD.. I purchased this product because I wanted to upgrade from a 200MB external drive to a bigger one. I chose WD because that is the brand I had for the smaller drive. I had no problems with that one until I tried to move the data to the new drive. Now even the old one stopped working.. The new HD does work, but it is unexpectedly slow. Very often it stops being recognized by my computer which is Dell 9150 running WinXP. I have to power down the HD and re-connect to computer or reboot the computer to get access. Never had to do that with the older drive.. Look for something else with better review. This one does not pass the smell test.. 

$$;
Pros:. Distinctive book-like design; disks are reliable so far.. 
Cons:. Often they do not connect with the computer.. 
Summary:. I have a 500GB and a 750GB MyBook FireWired to my MacBook Pro. I plan to use the second to back up the first. I'm delighted that they can be daisy-chained, requiring only one FireWire cable into the laptop (it has only one port). However, frequently one or both does not appear on the desktop; they are inaccessible. WD support blamed the problem on defective cables, but after they replaced the third "defective" cable without fixing the problem, I stopped asking. I just disconnect and unpower, reconnect and repower until they work.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice Design. 
Cons:. Failed after a few months, didn't like the software. 
Summary:. This was my first external HD and I bought this device with hopes I was getting a quality/reliable drive to backup important files (finances, mp3, family photos, etc) in the event the HD on my PC failed.. First problem was the software it came with. It was clumsy and I ended up downloading a 3rd party free product and didn't bother with the software they provided.. Worked well for a few months, and then just stopped working entirely. I can't get my computer to recognize it anymore, and when it turns on it makes this strange sound like something spinning down over and over.. I've only had it for 3-4 months so I am giong to try to get it replaced ... but I have concerns that it wont last even if they do fix it. I don't recommend this line (MyBook).. 

$$;
Pros:. for sale everywhere, competitively priced. 
Cons:. lacks functionality of other firewire drives. 
Summary:. My brother bought a 250GB version of this drive as an alternate way to boot a Mac G4 Powerbook with a dying internal drive. I partitioned the drive and cloned a boot volume from another working G4 tower--no go. Neither the tower nor the laptop will boot from this drive. I did extensive online research and cloned my tower twice with no success. I've made other bootable external firewire volumes on LaCie and Maxtor drives without a problem. Hopefully, he can get a refund on this and try brand. This drive is probably fine for data only but being non-bootable is a show-stopper for us.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing good to say about WD.. 
Cons:. DOES WORK when you need it to. Only used one time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WD doesn't care. They are no help.. 
Summary:. It only worked 1 time. I put it on my shelf above desk. When comupter crashed took it back down to use when I got computer back. Did not work. Was already past the 1 year warranty period. WD no help even though this seems to be common with WD external drives. I went and bought a FREE AGENT external drive that had no complaints on the internet and was rated higher than Western Digital. My WD My book was a waste of good money. I will never buy another WD product EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. ...what pros?. 
Cons:. This device failed after little more than a month. I lost 400GB of professional photography work. Paid hundreds trying to get data off this piece of garbage, and no one was able to.. 
Summary:. Piece of garbage. Fails. Unreliable.. 

$$;
Pros:. 500gb cheap price at the time.. 
Cons:. after a few month, it started happening what happened to all, running too damn hot, then not being recognized by the pc, it is pretty damn slow also.. those 4 or 5 clicks and then nothing on the drive, then when magically start working again..2 min.. 
Summary:. I am testing this with it now:. i am putting a bigger power supply, I know sometimes, when electronics don't have enought juice to run, they get really hot.. I also took the crappy plstic box away, and I am adding a small fan on top of the drive and controller, to make some air pass by and see if with those 2 things, it gets better. i am guessing the WD people could be so cheap that they used a .68 A power supply, when the HD itself uses like .70 A now I am going to make it run with a 1.0 A power supply (like 0.3 more) to see what happens... i am just pissed of because I have like 425 GB of data in it, and every time I try to back up it fails on me...I think the HD itself is in good working condition, the issue is in the design of the controller/power supply, and enclosemet. in fact, the metallic enclosure inside, has space for a fan that was never there( another cheap move from WD?). i am no electrician, just an adventurer, so don't try this at home.. Wish you all luck with the bad purchase.. BTW, I tried another enclosure and it worked fine for like another 30 minutes, then it did not work again, getting too hot also... this might give a break to the engineers of WD... I dunno.. let me know if someone found a good solution to make this HD work properly for long time as it should.. 

$$;
Pros:. Can't think of any.. 
Cons:. Tech support. We've had nothing but problems with this unit and tech support has been less than helpful.. 
Summary:. Tech support. We've had nothing but problems with this unit and tech support has been less than helpful. There have been a couple multi-hour calls to tech support with little if anything getting resolved. If the unit does not complete it's initial back up it rewrites the info back to the original hard drive, doubling it's volume. This happened to us three times resulting in our initial back up being our hard drive times 8. Also we tried to transfer it from a PC to a Mac and when it had problems tech support said "you bought it a while back so we no longer support it". So if you don't heed my warning and get one anyway, don't plan on using it any longer than the life of the computer you buy it for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price was good and appearance looks like book sitting on shelf.. 
Cons:. Bought to copy hard drive from old desktop to laptop. When I connected to laptop nothing worked. Customer service said because I already loaded onto one PC I can't load to another. Returned old unit bought new "revised" unit still doesn't work.. 
Summary:. If you only plan to use for one computer ONLY and FOREVER this might be OK. Otherwise forget it! My friends like Seagate.. 

$$;
Pros:. External hard drive. 
Cons:. Died after one year,. 
Summary:. I thought it might be a power suppy problem so I took the hard drive out. Nope, the hard drive is dead. So much for backing up. 

$$;
Pros:. NONE NONE NONE. 
Cons:. EVERYTHING! Computer never saw it : USB/firewire/esata!!!. 
Summary:. DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER IT! Bought an ext. enclosure with USB/Esata from Monoprice for $25 and put drive in it... works first time out of box!. 

$$;
Pros:. Price. Easy to hook up.. 
Cons:. Worked for about 1.5 years, started buzzing, then clicking, then no longer recognized by the OS. I've got another WD (pre-my-book) 250GB and it's still going strong. Seems like the quality took a dive with the MyBook series.. 
Summary:. These failures are common with this drive--look for something else.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good when it worked.. 
Cons:. Barely lasted longer than its warranty.. 
Summary:. Not recommended - won't last.. 

$$;
Pros:. In view of failing in its main task I consider it a complete failure as a hard drive. Imagine your car is going into hybernation during driving.... So zero pro. 
Cons:. Same as above: In view of failing in its main task I consider it a complete failure as a hard drive. Imagine your car is going into hybernation during driving.... So zero pro. 
Summary:. Lousy manual, lousy after sales service and a lousy product built on undeserved reputation. There must be a terrible quality control process (if they would have any at all). The stress that this bad product (not only the 500 Gb version, but all MyBook editions as well) causes to users not worth it to purchase even for 0 dollar... Potential losses due to losing one's data, etc... can run into thousands. If I wouldn't have a TrekStor 2nd ext. hard drive, I could have been pone of those. Final verdict: buy Western Digital only if you have a death-wish!!! - ps. needless to say that my queries to Western Digital never been replied to.... 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to setup, good transfer rate. 
Cons:. It just died for no reason. 
Summary:. Have had the MyBook for just over a year now, and it just died on me one day. Tried to access the drive, and I all heard was a clicking sound. Warranty had expired and there is no easy way to recover my files, other than a third party service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of capacity.. 
Cons:. Sudden death in13 months.. 
Summary:. This unit performed well for 13 months and then without warning it died. I purchased the unit with my AMEX card which extends the warranty, however, data recovery is not covered. Unless I want to pay more than $1200 to retrieve the data I am out of luck. By contrast I have a 3 year old LaCie external hard drive that is alive and performing quite well. My recommendation: avoid WD products.. 

$$;
Pros:. Geat when it's working (IF it's working). 
Cons:. Disaster when it dies (and it probably will). 
Summary:. I got suckered by the initial great reviews into buying this thing. At first, I loved it! Loved it so much I used as a main storage device. Worked so well at first, I got cocky, and I only bothered backing up a tiny fraction of the data on it. In fact, I used it to also back up data from my primary system drive.. But nothing is worse than being betrayed by something you love.. Over a period of maybe ten months or so, I put somewhere between 200-300 GB of data on this thing. Then, one day, it just up and died. Mechanical failure, I believe. Yes, after less than a year of use and no kind of abuse, it just died on me.. Now, Im looking at paying well over $1000 for data recovery, which is not covered under the warranty, of course. Thats assuming the data is still there and wasnt destroyed.. I also need to buy a new external HDD. It certainly wont be one made by Western Digital.. DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE!!! (or anything else made by this useless company). 

$$;
Pros:. Nice looks. 
Cons:. Doesn't last. 
Summary:. Bought one at Costco 6 months ago. Now I'm stuck with a brick. Downloaded several programs to try file recovery, but no luck..constant errors. The physical drive is recognized, but not the logical. Hopefully I can return it and try something else! Very disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Disk drive OK. 
Cons:. Interface Sucks. 
Summary:. I just ordered my second replacement drive. The first wouldn't power up no matter what I did. The Firewire interface on the second drive just failed. Luckily, the USB interface still works.. An additional irritant was spending 45 minutes with support trying to straighten out my warranty.. Throughout the years I've always had excellent luck with WD drives, and I believe that the drives in the My Book enclosure are fine. The interface electronics seem to be the weak link on this product.. My next external drive will be in an user serviceable enclosure, and it for darn sure won't be a WD.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small and Fairly Light for 500GB. 
Cons:. Western Digital Confirms Power Off Problems. 
Summary:. Western digital call agents confirmed that these drives have some "unusual" problem where they power off repeatedly and unexpectedly without the user initiating the power down and in the middle of use.. The first call agent got a "senior manager" who then claimed that it's only happened to "one or two drives" but that there was a dedicated support agent for this specific problem with this drive -- this seems highly unlikely as the support agent wouldn't have any work to do.. The level two support guy also said that this dedicated support agent couldn't call me back until tomorrow because he was so busy on calls -- where do they get these people? My three-year-old daughter can make up a more internally consistent fabrication than this guy.. He asked me not to take it back and to instead wait a day or two to have a call agent explore the issue with me. I told him that if they were going to compensate me as part of their support staff, I'd do it, but otherwise they should try to hire a few extra people to test these things before they ship them.. Unless you too want to volunteer 20 hours of work for the Western Digital support department, don't buy this drive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Haven't been able to load software hence unable to comment. 
Cons:. I run a very stable HP XP system for my business and bought the above external hard drive. In the installation the software has repeatedly caused a mega lock up of my system requiring a power off restarts. 
Summary:. A total software dud; if you value the information on a work system keep away from it.. Re WD MY BOOK external hard drive. I run a very stable HP XP system for my business and bought the above external hard drive. In the installation the software has repeatedly caused a mega lock up of my system requiring a power off restart after 11 hours of waiting for a back up with the wd screen mixed in with my screen savers. When restarted, Outlook would not start up, Norton 360 had erroor messages, there was a warning from ATI about needing permission to change something and the system took 15 minutes to start with my hard drive going flat out at all times.. A scary product when I was looking for something to safeguard the invaluable info on my system. Even scarier was that each frustrating time I started again, the info backed up was no longer in the external hard drive. I have used many many office product but NEVER one so buggy as this. A total dud.. Even sending an email to them is a totally frustrating exercise; what the bloody hell is an RMA number, no part of the product, receipt or packaging has this number.. 

$$;
Pros:. I thought it was good until it died.. 
Cons:. I am so angry on this one. I bought this machine as an external storage drive so I wouldn't clog my hard drive, then it completely failed. They say the recovery charge will be a minimum of $100 -- which is more than the drive cost. I am furious.. 
Summary:. DO NOT TRUST THIS BRAND!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price at Costco. 
Cons:. I bought two MyBook external drives at Costco, one 500MB and one 1TB. They both died within a year. Before they died, they both repeatedly became unviewable in Windows. Worst garbage I've encountered in many years of buying computers and peripherals.. 
Summary:. Unspeakably bad. Stay far, far away. My only question now is "will it blend?". 

$$;
Pros:. Fast and light unit. 
Cons:. Seems like the connections don't last. The drives were on did not show any connections and repeatedly did not connect after initial problems. I see the unit is on and does not connect to any connection.. 
Summary:. 2 drives crapped out after 4 months of basic use. I have other ... older drives pumping away and are trouble free. This drives are not reliable! Don't invest in them if you want to keep your data. They just seem to stop working without any warning that something is wrong !!. Updated. on Sep 9, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. No good common about Western Digital's design and their support at all. I have encountered bad experience with them and their product. Never buy WD product or computers that use their products again.. 
Cons:. My WD5000D032 doesn't boot up any more. It doesn't allow me to debug or data recover. I stored valuable pictures and videos taken from my young baby, friends and families. I'd appreciate if anyone can provide a clear instruction on data recovery.. 

$$;
Pros:. For the first year it was great. After that, not so much.. 
Cons:. The drive dies after NORMAL use any other drive would handle with flying colors.. 
Summary:. The drive started acting up so I thought I'd take everything off, check for errors, reformat, and be on my way. Not a moment too soon apparently. It took almost 6 hours to move the data because the drive would randomly disappear, except the blue light kept doing it's thing like it was actually doing work.. After I finally got my data off, I started to reformat the drive and it wouldn't even get halfway through before it just stopped. I certainly won't be using it ever again. My other external HD (Acomdata) has been working great since the day I bought it 5+ years ago. Looks like I know which HD I'm going to buy to replace this piece of junk WD drive. Anyone need a paper weight?. 

$$;
Pros:. I didn't find anything useful other than it was on sale.. 
Cons:. Power supply gave up on me only after two months of use.. 
Summary:. This product is NOT worth your money. Don't waste your time and money over this product. I'd rather pay more for something that is reliable. Western Digital you sure lost one customer. I am NEVER getting any product from your company.. 

$$;
Pros:. aesthetics and storage capacity. 
Cons:. Stopped working after less than 2 years. Customer support is abysmal.. 
Summary:. Called customer support to see if I could send the drive to them to have it repaired. My only option was to pay $14.95 to talk with their tech support. Due to the weird clicking sounds, it likely was a hardware problem, but they will not repair it. They don't sell parts so they don't do repairs.. I asked if this product has experienced similar problems and he asked if I started my computer with the external attached, which I have. He stated this is very bad for all externals and was likely the cause of my failure. I've had 2 other externals that are older than this one and still work to this day. I'm now left with a very expensive paper weight.. After that call, did some research on the web which brought me here. Appears I'm not the only one that's having problems with this line of product. It's a shame that they didn't accept the blame for producing a crappy product.. Bottom line, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER WESTERN DIGITAL PRODUCT AGAIN!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing this is a terrible piece of equipment. 
Cons:. Its slow, it does not always load to your computer unless you restart and a couple of months after the warranty was up it stopped loading completely and i lost all of my information on it.. 
Summary:. The WD 500GB hard drive is a terrible piece of equipment. To begin i bough it when it used to run around $250 dollars now it runs around $120 and there is a reason for that. From day one it was so slow to load and sometimes would not load unless i would restart my computer. A couple months after the one year mark (when the warranty was expired) i restart my computer because it didnt load when i plugged it into the USB (i even tried the firewire) but it clicked and would not load any of my information. I lost everything. After arguing with the WD customer service who basically pushed the blame on me saying i should have had all of my information backed up somewhere else and there was nothing they could do, i decided that i would never purchase another WD piece of equipment ever again. I Absolutely do not recommend this product. My friend also owns this WD hard drive and he says his is doing the same thing and is also beginning to click. BEWARE this thing is crap!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing is good about this product. It will die and make you loose all your data.. 
Cons:. Everything; piece of garbage. 
Summary:. I feel that I wasted my money buying this dead thing that took all my precious memories with it (pictures and music). Last time I buy a Western Digital product.. 

$$;
Pros:. They're relatively inexpensive (but not the cheapest by any means). 
Cons:. Mine lasted a couple of months past the lousy 1 yr warranty. Western Digital's customer service wasn't helpful at all since they said it was out of warranty. They say there's no way for me to open the case to try to recover data off the drive either.. 
Summary:. I paid a little more than I would have for some other drives and bought a MyBook because I believed Western Digital was a good brand with quality. And, it was a little cheaper than the really premium brands. But, the few bucks I saved on this drive are trivial compared to the value of the data I lost. The MyBooks just aren't worth it. You can find cheaper drives that last longer, access faster, and have better customer support.. Mine couldn't be accessed by the computer just a few months after they say the 1 yr. warranty expired. It powers up, and doesn't make any ugly noises, but none of the computers I've tried subsequently can recognize it. It's probably just a problem with the electronic controllers, but, because the warranty was expired, their customer support just wasn't interested in even trying to help.. Add to that the fact that they tell me the case cannot be opened to access the drive, so I can't even open it up to try to replace the contorller myself or even to try to recover the data.. Bottom line: Seagates and LaCies, for example, are less expensive AND last longer, much longer. There are plenty of other brands that are decent quality too, even if they seem a little more expensive at first. The Western Digital MyBook will costs twice as much when you realize that you have to buy two of them to back each other up for when they crash in 18 months. If you don't need the data, then just don't save it. If you need the data, then you need something better than a MyBook.. 

$$;
Pros:. nothing at all. 
Cons:. worked for just over a year, maybe used 10 times...look at the other reviews, this is a common theme...bought at costco, crashed and no support. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME...look for another company that is willing to stand behind their drives. 
Summary:. POS and a waste of money. no constumer support or willingness to help. there is a reason for a 1 year warranty...the failure rate is significant after that time....my 15 year NEC hard is more reliable then this POS. how can a new drive have so many issues with so little use and why can't a company own up to the fact so many ppl have complained.. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE anything from Western Digital. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up. 
Cons:. Fails - multiple reports on the web of external My Book failures (unlike WD internal hard drives which are fairly reliable). Usually with clicking but not showing up on desktop.. 
Summary:. I have a 500 gb My Book Premium Edition WD5000N that wouldn't show up and was continuously clicking every 1-2 seconds. I discovered it as soon as it started to malfunction and tried several ways to get it to show up on the MAC Desktop by trying different cables/computers/USB versus Firewire/turning on and off multiple times/using DiskWarrior and Disk Utility/Applejjack to do repairs for about an hour or so. Nothing worked. The disk wouldn't show up on the Desktop and continued to click.. I then read about others who removed the hard drive from the external unit and mounted the drive internally so I decided to try this.. Mine differed from these enclosures:. http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/7/t819501-how-to-take-apart-your-wd-mybook/. http://www.ransackery.com/western-digital-mybook-open-case-recover-data.htm. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FlySnyJ0CQ. It is closest to this one:. http://www.sigg3.net/b2perma.php?p=1185&#38;c=1 but no rubber band - only glued on metal cover.. I had to destroy the case to get the hard drive out as mine differed from the ones described above (and they are not built to take apart!!!!). First there are no external screws. Pry off the metal perforated grill that covers the back of the unit. This is just glued on. Instead of a rubber gasket, my unit had vinyl that was all part of one piece so I couldn't peal off the gasket. Taking off the metal perforated grill reveals 3 tabs on the bottom (these were covered up) plus the readily apparent 3 tabs on the top. Press these down and hold them down by wedging something in the perforations. On the long edge close to the connectors, pry outward with a screw driver since there are tabs here that prevent you from sliding the hard drive out. Then try to slide out the hard drive away from the metal skin. This method is based on the disassembled unit. I had to pry the whole plastic unit away from the metal front casing so if the above method doesn't work, try brute force (just don't pry on the hard drive.. One you get the plastic holder away from the metal front piece, take out every screw you can see. Be careful with the flat screw that holds the on/off switch (if your unit has one) since this is easy to strip. Take out the 4 screws holding the SATA circuitry to the hard drive and unplug the wires, the 3 screws holding the front switch, and the 4 screws holding the hard drive to the plastic piece. This allows you to remove the metal holder and the hard drive. Now take off the 4 screws that hold the hard drive in place. Then pry off the silicone washers. This releases the hard drive which is covered with a metal film. Carefully pry/peal this off. Don't damage the controller board.. This revealed a WD5000ks caviar drive se16 which is a SATA drive made April 22, 2006.. Western Digital Caviar SE16 WD5000KS 500GB 7200 RPM 16MB Cache SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive - OEM. No jumpers were installed.. I installed the drive into the internal slot of my PowerMac G5 and it now shows up on the desktop. I rebuilt the drive with Disk Warrior (it had minor errors) and checked it with SMARTReporter which reports that the drive passes the SMART tests.. It's has been up for 5 hours and works fine, no data loss.. So, I think that the problem was with a defective SATA connector/circuit. If you catch the drive early when it begins clicking (don't leave it on long with it clicking as this may mess up the hard drive heads), you can remove the drive and use the SATA circuits in your computer to mount the drive.. Hope this helps. Again, my advice is the minute you hear the clicking sounds, try fixing via usual techniques but if these don't work, take the hard drive out of the enclosure (sooner rather than later) and try it internally. This will void your warranty but might allow you to save your data (and maybe even the hard drive).. 

$$;
Pros:. Size and appearance. 
Cons:. Reliability. 
Summary:. Used it for few months and having power down problem like everyone else. I wasn't diligent enough to do my research on the item before purchasing it. After it failed on me, I noticed lot of consumers having the same couple of problems. This hardware is definitely not reliable and I recommend everyone to stay away from any Western Digital External Hard drives.. 

$$;
Pros:. The only thing I am looking for from a hard drive is reliability. I did not get it with this one.. 
Cons:. The drive died after less than 2 years.. 
Summary:. The drive showed signs of problems from day 1 when it would suddenly disconnect and give a "delayed write error" when copying very large (above 1 GB) files. I could live with that. But now it is not recognized by the computer at all, and you hear the characteristic clicks from the drive when it tries to start up. I've tried using diagnostic tools, such as MHDD and WD's own tools, but all of them fail to connect to it. My internet research shows that short of replacing the magnetic head stack (a cleanroom exercise), nothing can save it. I've been using it for less than 2 years.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use.. 
Cons:. You never know when it will work or when it will not.. 
Summary:. I will never buy a WD hard drive again. Technical support was terrible. The drive only works some of the time. Most times my computer won't read the drive. Then out of the blue it works. Frustrating!. 

$$;
Pros:. I really can't think of anything positive to say.. 
Cons:. The drive failed shortly after my one-year warranty was up.. 
Summary:. I used the hard drive to store some media files and to back up my laptop each week.. I recently plugged it in to do the regular weekly back-up and got a message saying the drive needed to be formatted. I called Western Digital and they were not helpful at all...told me the drive had failed and to Google for a free data recovery program.. That didn't work, as the drive wasn't recognized by the program or my computer(kept getting format message), so I called a data recovery service. They said much of their business these days is recovering data from failed Western Digital Books. I am now paying them a lot of money to recover my photos, music, etc, from a hard drive that lasted little more than a years.. I've learned two lessons...to have two media storage sources and to never buy another Western Digital hard-drive. 

$$;
Pros:. looks nice. 
Cons:. quality of disk poor. 
Summary:. The review does not take into account the lifetime of the unit. My MyBook unit died with less then 2 year limited use. Left with hundreds of GB's lost data and no support. I have never had disks with such a short life span. Searching the web i am not alone. My advise, seek for a more rugidized unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. none literally none. 
Cons:. too many to describe, read other neghative reviews all accurate. 
Summary:. One year after purchasing two of these drives, both, within three weeks, have failed, (out of warranty). After the first died and arguing for 2 hours with succesive customer support individuals, (you all know the rutine) they agreed to send me a RMA for replacement, (additional cost time etc.). I will not bother again as a replacement would be a waste of time, (I am certain the repplacement they sent for the first will fail)! I am moving on will never buy from western digital again!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap, easy to use. 
Cons:. Slow, sudden malfunction, TOTAL FAILURE in just little over a YEAR [1-yr is the factory warrenty provided]. 
Summary:. I was happy to see the nice sleek looking HD; when it first arrived, and also was happy for quite a while.. Although during regular usage i found it to be little slow than what i expected, but it was OK. Someimes. I found that the external drive wouldn't show up in the explorer, which, i found that, comes back with a. hard power cycle.. But the main nightmare happened when the whole drive became disfunctional one day. I could hear 6 clicking. noise when trying to access it, then the HD appears losing any internal motion. I lost many valuable data. stored there. Honestly it appears to be a scam, while you are lured to buy a cheap hard drive, and in turn. the system crashes, and the data recovery takes about thousand. Thenk twice before buying My Book!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact Design. 
Cons:. HIGH FAILURE RATE!. 
Summary:. The Western Digital My Book is an excellent storage divice with a MAJOR flaw.. It is UNRELIABLE and may fail at any given moment! I had one sitting on my shelf for almost three years, to back up the data in my old Dell. The Western Digital My Book failed, but the hard drive in my old Dell is still working. I will be buying a SEAGATE with it's (5) FIVE year warranty for my future back up storage.. Forget about Customer Service a Western Digital, the guy in India was more help.. 

$$;
Pros:. works fine. 
Cons:. until your electricity goes out. 
Summary:. In the case of unplugging without shutting down or, if you have a power outtage all the data is lost and the drive is no longer usuable - at all. No putting data back on it. It's trashed permanently. I looked it up on their web site and this was listed as a standard function of power loss.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing that other external drives dont also have.. 
Cons:. Short lifespan and shorter warranty period.. 
Summary:. I bought this drive in January of last year and it stopped responding this month (May). I have had the drive for barely 16 months and it is already useless and all my data is lost unless I can find a way to get the drive to respond. When I sent WD support an email they just said that it is out of warranty and they can do nothing for me. With a failure time of 16 months and a warranty period of 1 year you do not want to spend the money that they ask for this piece of junk. If it was just a few bad sectors then at least I may have been able to recover most of my data but it just stopped working altogether. WD don't give a hoot about their customers and I think that they deliberately choose a short warranty period because their product is rubbish and it would cost them too much to support us. Instead we customers pay the price for trusting them and their slogans that there drives are designed to protect our data. Now there is a lawsuit for misrepresentation just waiting to happen.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's pretty.. 
Cons:. Serial number defaced, loud, slow, heavy, vibrates a ton, board failed. 
Summary:. This drive is pretty. Yeah, that's about it. It's a Western Digital, so the story is automatically bad.. Let's start with the first and main problem: The board died. WD won't touch it because the serial number doesn't match the drive's model. The serial number reports a 300 GB internal hard disk, and mine is an external 250. Being me, curious, I took it apart because I couldn't get service. I've found which chip it is: it's a ST Semi power controller that's getting very, very, very hot. it left a small red mark.. When it actually worked, it was very slow to read and write. The processor is a simple oxford semi, and it's not too fast.. It put off a lot of heat and for the first couple days a burning electrical smell that was sickening. Had to have a fan beside it.. It made horrible vibrating noises and it was very loud.. Go get a seagate or a LaCie or a SmartDisk. WD is awful.. Western Digital. Because we hate you(tm). 

$$;
Pros:. Pros are be smart find another brand. 
Cons:. dont waste your money. 
Summary:. I trusted this to be a great hard drive ....but when you try to access the drive and all you get is drive must be formatted ...when you have 10 gig of personal pics, data and music that you cant recover ????? whats the sence of even having a drive to store on.......Big dissapointment as well as you trust your storage to be safe when all it does is lose it.....Never will I ever buy another Western digital MY BOOK or any of its products.....I would have rated this a minus 10 but 1 was the lowest it would rate it. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap to purchase.. 
Cons:. Data loss, powers down on it's own, slow.. 
Summary:. Drive is 1 week old and it already has bad sectors.  I've had two of these fail already due to bad cards on the HDD itself.  Drive is slow when you move data to another device, around on the drive itself, or even listing files.  Drive will power down on it's own to save power.  The power down is horrible because XP hangs whenever you try to access a filestore, even one which is not on the drive.  Empty recycle bin?  Spin up external drive.  Open My Computer?  Spin up external drive.  Save a file to your desktop?  Spin up external drive.. Again, do not purchase this device.  If you want an external drive, get one with a power switch.. 

$$;
Pros:. None, its not dependable Therefore not worth anything. 
Cons:. It's not dependable; cannot trust it will remain 'on' for an entire backup cycle. 
Summary:. VERY disappointed in this hardware. I thought WesternDigital had integrity, but I think the "pointy-hair" manager said ship-it regardless of the issues.. I cannot image they where unaware that the disk would unexpectedly turn itself off or something, it happens so often.  The computer reports the device is working correctly, although it also thinks it has 0 disk space, and no files to display.. Western Digital should be ashamed that they allowed a crappy product like this on the market with their name on it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice looking. 
Cons:. But don't bother trying to restore anything. 
Summary:. Oh, I was trying so hard to be conscientious by backing everything up onto MyBook. Then the computer crashed. "That's OK", I thought, "the backup is only 2 hours old. The old computer may be dead, but there's plenty of room on the new one.". Hah! There may be room, but just try restoring any data. Guess what? You can't! Both systems were running Windows XP SP2, yet computer B couldn't work with computer A's backup files - the software (which is EXTREMELY unfriendly and uninformative in failure mode) kept either throwing bad memory reference errors, or telling me that the backup was in an invalid format, depending on which way I tried to restore.. I finally made the call to tech support  who couldn't open a proper case for me, sorry, because they couldn't open a case or authorize my credit card because their "computer was down". I finally got to a manager (after being on hold for 15 minutes) who was compassionate enough to help. He talked me through a couple of things that weren't very obvious (I've been a software engineer for 30 years - believe me, they're WAY beyond non-obvious) and we got off the phone 45 minutes ago, and just now (as I'm writing this) the restore software (from a backup on the current machine which we were trying just to eliminate problems) tells me that it's ready to proceed with a restore of 20 GB worth of backup, which it has taken just shy of an hour to get ready to do. Speedy, it ain't. And it takes about the same amount of time to get ready to start a backup - you can't just select the files or drives you want to backup, click "go" and walk away - noooo, it's got to build a detailed file list FIRST, and then you click and walk away. So if I start the backup at midnight, I can't go to bed until 1:00, because I've got to wait for the stupid file list to build.. The real show stopper, however, is this inability to restore files off another computer to a new computer. The support manager's take on this was "well, sounds like you should have done a copy and paste, ha ha ha".. Lucky for him I couldn't reach through the telephone. What do you purchase a backup system for? Restore after catastrophe, do you think? Unbelieveable... do NOT purchase this product.. When attempting to preview this rating, I received a warning from CNet that I should be pretty sure what I'm doing by giving a rating of "Abysmal". I do not choose this rating lightly. I reviewed the definition standards. "Abysmal" is merited when "The product has no redeeming qualities and worse, may actually harm you or your productivity". Well, it certainly has harmed my productivity in this instance. I thought my data was safely backed up AND RESTORABLE. It may have been backed up, but if I cannot restore that work (and I have now invested over three hours in attempting to do so), I am - how do you say it? ah, yes: HOSED.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good concept. 
Cons:. It doesn't work and they won't fix it. 
Summary:. The power supply/USB interface module is junk. The drive failed and didn't say why. I took the actual drive out of the enclosure and it worked fine in a PC with a SATA controller and power supply, so you know it's the tinker-toy module in the external enclosure. I called WD to tell them about it and they told me I voided the warranty by opening the case. If you want your data, take the disk out because it seems like the problems are caused by the interface. Even a junk company like WD can usually get a hard drive to work, but don't buy this toy. If you have one that won't respond, you can recover the data by connecting the SATA drive with a real interface, but WD will void your warranty. WD seems to not realize that people actually value the data that is put onto their hard drives.. 

$$;
Pros:. There are no pros.. 
Cons:. The drive is fried, I lost everything.. 
Summary:. I had all my pictures from a summer in Europe on this drive, and now the drive no longer works. I took it into computer hardware repair experts and they were unable to recover the data. Don't ever buy anything that this company has made if you want to keep your data safe.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice design. 
Cons:. firewire port fails within couple of weeks; usb port fails next. 
Summary:. I bought one WD MyBook 500GB drive for backing up my digital photos in June 2007. I had the photos backed up on two different MacBook Pro laptops as well. In October 2007, I got another WD MyBook drive to backup/mirror the first drive as I needed more drive space on my MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, as I was beginning the backup/mirror process, my primary MyBook drive (just under 300GB of data) failed. I should have known it was failing as the firewire port was no longer working and only the USB port worked. The drive failed - my MacBook Pro no longer recognized it and a friend's MacBook didn't recognize it. I took it to We Fix Macs and thankfully they were able to recover most of the data - there was a subset of data that was only backed up on that drive. The store had 3 other MyBooks in for recovery. Mine was the only one that had its data recovered. If your Firewire port fails - get your data off the drive while the USB port still works. If both ports have failed, don't try recovering the data yourself, take it to a professional. The drive cost me just under $200; recovery cost just over $250.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks cooll. 
Cons:. It dies in a flies lifetime!!!!!!!. 
Summary:. I bought the 320 gig version, because ive bought drives from WD before, but this one is a flop. It died in 4 months and i lost 60 gigs of data, not as much as some but significant to me. I sent there support team an email and all they can say is we are sorry, then they sent me links to all there downloadable software for my dead drive and said try this and if we dont hear back from you in 96 hours then we consider the problem solved. Thanx so much for the customer support. Even if they sent me 10 free ones I wouldnt put a single file on them.. 

$$;
Pros:. The device looks nice. 
Cons:. Reports that files are there, then magically they disappear. 
Summary:. I spent the entire day trying to copy 190GB of data on to this device to backup my company's server data. First, I got an error that it couldn't support a file name that was too long - the name was fine for Microsoft File Explorer! Then I got some "Write Delay" errors, after that I couldn't access the drive anymore as when Windows recognized it, it registered as unformatted. So I did a Quick Format. Now I have a regular functioning drive. Then I start copying, after a couple of hours, I get a file name issue again. I correct the issue and validate that all 62,000 files are in the directory. I move on and get to the very last folder (after a total of 7 hours of copying) and start getting "Write Delay" errors again! I go back to validate the files that already existed and the 62,000 files that were in that last directory has been dropped to 2 (that's right two!). I will never buy a Western Digital product again!. 

$$;
Pros:. the light on the front looks pretty.... 
Cons:. WD is dangerous. 
Summary:. I had a two year old WD external drive, which, when it failed me, I figured it was just an unfortunate event and I went out to replace it with this bad boy. Little did I know that it would spiral into a series of unfortunate events.... I had this drive for exactly 4 weeks, just enough time to load the only copy of THOUSANDS of media files from various computers in my house in order to clear space. Today, it died the exact same way as the last one... no trauma, not even plugged into the wall, but when I went to turn it on, I got a light and nothing else. Just a random death without warning, much like a S.I.D. except for a hard drive not a baby. Scary stuff, I know...I took the drive to Computer Builder's Warehouse, who confirmed it was completely dead in every way, and I called every data recovery service approved by Western Digital. It's okay, they assured me, no matter what the problem is the cost would never exceed $3,750!!!!! Unbelievable. So unless you're planning on keeping two hard drives with identical information, or unless you bankroll enough loot to put away a few grand for hard drive data insurance, I would stay away from the WD.. R.I.P. to my peace of mind and to my half-terabyte of media....

Pros:. Cool blue light thingy. 
Cons:. Died after a few months.. 
Summary:. Bought at Costco. WD support sucks. Don't rely on these drives for backup unless you make multiple copies. Or, be ready to pay for data recovery services..

Pros:. Looks good sitting on a shelf. 
Cons:. Customer Service. 
Summary:. I bought the 1000 GB version of the My Book Pro Edition II and it died within 3 days.. Western Digital customer service said they would only replace it with a refurbished model.. I bought it new and 3 days later I only get a refurbished replacement??. Buy Maxtor.

Pros:. Powers off automaticly when computer is turned off. 
Cons:. No security to protect the contents if lost or stolen , other makes of external hard drives has. 
Summary:. Very slow , terrible phone suport , have to buy third party software for security , that is also a risk of compatibilty with this HDD ,. Powers off , even while computer is on and on idle ,cannot power up unless unpluging the hard drive and rebooting computer .. My old Maxtor Onetouch III did not have this problem .Plus Maxtor has security software ..

Pros:. It looks cool. 
Cons:. Unreliable. No daisy-chaining of firewire possible!. 
Summary:. I bought 2 of these at Costco (as did my 2 of my friends). We all found out the hard way that you can NOT daisy chain these "PREMIUM" drives via firewire. Western Digital tech support is an absolute joke. They corresponded with me via email, I responded and told them what the problem was, and then no email in return! I called them and they said they never heard of the problem and didn't know what to tell me.. Not wanting to throw in the towel, I googled and googled until I found I found this thread:. http://www.macfixitforums.com/showflat.php?Cat=&#38;Board=periphs&#38;Number=800344&#38;page=0&#38;view=collapsed&#38;sb=5&#38;o=31&#38;fpart=1. Apparently it has something to do with the Firewire ID's not being unique, or something to that effect.. DO NOT BUY THESE DRIVES! Good looks, but useless!.
