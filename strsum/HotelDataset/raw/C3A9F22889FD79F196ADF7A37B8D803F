there was a young lady at front desk , tiara , who really bent over backwards to make my stay a pleasant experience , i do n't think i walked through that lobby once without being greeted as a welcome guest .
biggest nuisances were a clothes dryer that could not dry a very small load for the $ 1 .

there were a couple of room glitches , a refrigerator that had no mini freezer , so no way to keep a frozen meal cold for the microwave , thermostats that turned themselves off with lack of movement , so guess what happens when you go to sleep !
they had the standard cards in room for the `` be green '' , hang your . . .

they had the standard cards in room for the `` be green '' , hang your towel so you could re-use , but it did not matter , towels were taken no matter where i hung them.
