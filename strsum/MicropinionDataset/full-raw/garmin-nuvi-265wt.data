good routes and re    calculating if you make a wrong turn voice directions good and clear bluetooth works great with my i    phone haven't tried the traffic receiver yet will be using that in the am i bought the refurbished 265wt for only $119 with full one year warranty could not be happier  .
i bought it from here   http  //www  .
garmin    nuvi    265wt  .
com/  .
i is surprised by the price tag they had when i bought it  .
it's a very great product  .
it is the best gps i have ever had  .
definitely a must    have for everybody  .
you won't be disappointed with this gps  .
i got mine on black friday last year from tigerdirect  .
com and i only paid $159 total with tax and shipping included which is great  .
i do not think it's on sale there anymore but it might still be pretty cheap  .
they've been going down in price over the past few months everywhere and i've seen them as low as about $175  .
it's easily worth $300 so anything under that is totally worth it  .
the sd card slot is great too it comes with 2gb of internal memory with about 600 mb free after they add the maps to it so having the option to add another 8gb for your own software (red light cams , etc  .
) is great  .
this is my third gps system  .
i spent a little more this time and it really paid off  .
the where am i feature is fast and accurate  .
i wish i had purchased a model like this sooner .
just received the garmin 265wt for christmas  .
what a gift  .
i love the big screen  .
the announcments are clear and on time  .
much faster than my tom tom  .
i recommend it .
this is my first nav system and i recommend to anyone without hesitation  .
it is a budget minded nav system with many features last week i drove from michigan to florida and back over two thousand miles  .
three times garmin 265wt saved mes   1  .
late at night going to a hotel near the great smokey mountain , the highway is closed  .
garmin rerouted using local roads and got to the hotel without any trouble  .
facing the afternoon traffic jam at cincinnati , garmin rerouted using local roads and got back on the highway 6 miles further up bypassing the jam  .
late at night in southeastern michigan , highway is closed due to an accident , not detected by garmin , i existed the highway and used local roads going further north forcing garmin to reroute  .
with garmin  .
s reroute , i got back on i    75 two miles north from the accident site after a short delay .
bottom line is it will get you were you want to go much better than a map , it's easy to use , and i couldn't have ask for anything better (even if money is no object)  .
it may not put you in the driveway or parking lot your looking for , but if you need that much help , well , you can figure the rest of that statement out i do not live in an area with traffic reports , but you better believe when i am in tampa in a couple weeks i'll be trying it out  .
buy this unit  .
i got it for $260 (after some 'negotiations' with the store , and it has been worth every single cent  .
i love the nuvi 265wt  .
i have used the gps on my iphone for awhile but it is not reliable or practical to use on long car trips this is my first gps  .
after researching for awhile i decided on the 265wt  .
i really did not want to spend more than $200 on a gps but after seeing that traffic is included free for life , normally $60 , and that a bluetooth speaker is included , which i is looking to purchase as well and normally cost $70    100 , i decided on the nuvi 265wt  .
i purchased it from a reputable buyer on ebay for $300 plus s h i love the widescreen  .
the fact that it says the street names is great (the voice is a little robot    like but you get over it quick)  .
the frame rate is pretty good  .
it's a good beginner gps because it's very easy to use  .
everything is self explanatory i do have a gripe with garmin's customer service  .
i called up because i thought the traffic was not working (it is working fine it is just my own stupidity that made me not realize it) and a person answered  .
i thought wow  .
a person right away  .
she asked me how she can direct my call and i told her i thought i is having a technical issue and she put me on hold and connected me to a computer with a series of voice prompts  .
press 1 to purchase press 2 for technical support  .
after i went through the prompts my call is answered quickly but still why ask me how you can direct my call if you're just going to make me go through a bunch of computer options anyway  .
not a big deal but it just irked me in conclusion the garmin nuvi 265wt is a great gps system  .
especially for first time buyers that want a lot of features without taking a big chunk out of their wallet updated  .
on oct 29 , 2008  .
me or the satellite          needs to move        .
in order for it to be more accurate and btw          traffic updates are not happening       on country highways but may work great on freeways    (un    tested) its easy to operate          easy to up    date          loud enough to hear the spoken directions       fast to pick up directions on turns and make adjustments       if you choose to go a different route then it wants you too overall          in 98% happy with the product       and it is reasonably priced .
one day , i decided to tap in a location across town (just to test it out) and it told me to use the toll roads even though the local streets to get there were right there  .
even though it has some minor problems , i still would recommend this great navigation system for gps newbies got the n�vi 265wt for $200 at costco using a $20 off coupon .
awesome  .
i've recommended this gps to several friends and and colleagues and they have experienced the same results i have .
have had the product for about two weeks  .
i love it thus far  .
have taken on two road trips and it has operated flawlessly with the minor gripe of the speaker quality for bluetooth use  .
a lot of features for the $ , especially when compared to the nuvi 650 i bought a year ago for more money  .
i have now give one to each of my two driving kids .
i used this gps for a couple weeks on my regular commute and just took one long trip with it to a place i'd never been  .
the directions were accurate , and it adapted fairly quickly when i purposely chose a parallel road to avoid traffic  .
i love the big , clear screen  .
very easy to use spoken directions are clear and usually very good  .
if there are two quick turns in a row , it does not always give enough notice points of interest were up    to    date , even in remote rural areas the traffic is as helpful as any internet traffic site    not at all  .
but it's free , and the problem lies with the traffic source , not the gps the only con is the startup time  .
you must be sitting still and with a clear view of the sky for it to find a satellite  .
it does not work in my parking spot (in an alleyway)  .
it does not work in very slow moving traffic    you need to pull over and actually stop for 1 minute or so overall    very happy with it .
i've only had the unit for a few days , and i really like it  .
it's my first gps  .
i drive 90 miles a day to work on some of the most congested freeways in los angeles and so far this unit has been very helpful  .
bluetooth is a little distorted on one of two tests  .
could have been phone signal  .
but i still recommend it  .
good feature to cost ratio .
i wouls save the $ get the 255wt which i believe has everything except the bluetooth option  .
with an iphone's built    in gps , one would not think a dedicated gps device would still be necessary , but this little garmin is an excellent companion device for providing voice    aided turn    by    turn navigation , as well as being an excellent hands    free calling device  .
on a recent trip , i had my iphone playing music through my car stereo and connected to the garmin via bluetooth  .
when a call came in , i is able to see my iphone's caller id directly on the garmin , answer talk hands    free  .
during the time i is on the phone , the iphone is smart enough to pause resume the music automatically       how cool is that  .
another nice feature is being able to search for a poi and call the business directly from the garmin  .
it also displays my iphone's full contact list , battery status , and cell signal strength       all with a nice    sized screen that's easier to read while driving than fumbling around to look at the phone itself i purchased my nuvi 265wt at wal    mart online and a beanbag    type friction mount came with it for free       works great for using the garmin in multiple vehicles and rental cars  .
even though i totally did not have any realistic need for it , i bought the 265wt because i read good things about it , and the price is reasonable for what you get (and i am a gadget freak)  .
right out of the box , the 265wt is pretty much ready to go (you have to initialize the gps outdoors for about 3 minutes or so when you power it up for the first time)  .
it comes with everything you need to get up and running (power cord with inline fm traffic alert receiver , windshield mount , etc  .
) i live in an apartment complex that has been around since about 2004 , and the most up    to    date map database doesn't have any part of it  .
not that any of that matters , as i can usually find my way home  .
every other function is straight forward  .
living in omaha , there is usually no traffic to speak of , so the traffic alerts do not mean too much to me while i am roaming around locally  .
in addition to mapping , this unit also calculates your speed and can be used as a bona fide trip computer , measuring distance traveled , max speed , fuel cost (you input the current local gas prices) , length of time stopped , etc  .
, all of which is very accurate  .
one of the neatest features is the where am i function , which displays the nearest intersection to your location , and also shows the closest gas stations , hospitals , and police stations  .
this unit stows away in a pocket , purse , or bag , and you can electronically password    lock the unit so it would be useless if it were stolen  .
everything else is self    explanatory with the 265wt and i highly recommend it updated  .
on dec 19 , 2009  .
the garmin n�vi 265wt is your basic gps but loaded with features that are normally found in more expensive units it works great right out of the box  .
on its main display , you can view your vehicle's speed , map of where you're going , arrival time , next turn , etc the included bluetooth and traffic receiver are valuable add    ons that are costly when added to a unit  .
the traffic receiver is usually around $100 just for this one option  .
only complaint with the unit is its mapping software update  .
it needs to be more current  .
for example , i found several movie theaters that closed 2 years earlier that are still listed as points of interest  .
of course , if you just have to have the latest map , garmin can accommodate you for the rip off price of $100 the n�vi 265wt is a real bargain in a gps  .
sure , you can buy a gps for less money , but not with all the bells and whistles found in this one  .
i just purchased this unit from my local costco and have found it to be one of the best gps units i have ever used  .
out of the box , from a full cold start , it found its location accurately within 20 seconds or so (most units i have seen before take a few minutes)  .
garmin's new hotfix feature actually works as advertised  .
whenever i emerge from a signal dead zone (like a parking garage) the unit finds itself almost immediately  .
my old magellan would take at least a minute , if not several to do so also this unit has amazingly fast route recalculation response time  .
i purposefully drove against its directions and it realized and had a new route with a new direction within 5 seconds or less  .
again my old magellan would take about 30 seconds to a minute to recalculate (taking about 10 seconds just to realize i had gone the wrong way) the user interface is also very intuitive and easy to navigate  .
the features are great  .
ecoroute actually gives me usual information , providing estimates of my fuel consumption and and even costs incurred , all based on my vehicle type , fuel type , gas mileage , and its tracking data the only issue i have had so far is that the bluetooth speakerphone on this unit has so far been only satisfactory  .
most calls have been intelligible , but i often get told that i can just barely be understood  .
i am working on finding a better placement in my car to mitigate this issue for the money , this is probably one of your best bets for gps at the moment .
saved my butt on numerous occasions  .
very happy with purchase .
upgraded from 260w for unit with bluetooth but disappointed with quality of sound and microphone  .
volume adjustment should be mounted on the outside of the unit rather than on touch screen  .
hotfix keeps shutting off the unit here and there unexpectidly although it automatically turns back on  .
good selection of foreign languages with option to download more  .
excellent garmin factory support , as always  .
pois and addresss can easily be downloaded from google maps  .
overall good value for the money spent .
this is my first gps ever  .
is going to buy the 360 but the sales rep said it is discontinued and suggested the 265t series  .
the wider screen is more appealing to me  .
found it on ebay and the seller is in my living town  .
what a coincidance  .
i is able to save on s and h fees  .
sp bought it for 300$ an excellent price  .
i loved this product right away  .
easy to use  .
the text to speech feature is unbelievable  .
when you go off track , it quickly recalculates your new route  .
on the off side , the traffic component is stll not available in montreal (should be available in 2009)  .
also when using phone through the unnit , the caller finds that the voice does not look so clear so great buy for the price  .
do not hesitate to buy this unit .
for the price a very easy to use gps system  .
outstanding unit for the price , and much better than some comparable units  .
bluetooth capability is a key factor and many units higher priced do not have this capability .
so far i like it for what it does do but it doesn't do one of the main features i bought it for , which is the bluetooth phone hook up  .
it is only compatible with certain phones and you don't find this out before you buy the unit  .
in the past all my phones worked sucessfully with any bluetooth device i bought  .
i took it for granted that this device would work also  .
i is wrong  .
the traffic seems to work ok but i have not had any experiences where it saved me from a jam as of yet .
good unit once you get used to it  .
lifetime traffic a plus although it is slow to react to changing situations  .
route recalculations were fairly quick and gave satisfactory results  .
the sound should not be at full volume because it will clip the amplifier and cause unintelligable speech  .
keep it at 90 or below  .
i would recommend this unit especially if you get it on sale .
i found when using this model in a large city with multi    lane interstates , the turn announcements would not arrive soon enough for me to make needed lane changes at times  .
if the announcements would arrive sooner i would be totally happy with this model  .
outside of this problem and when used under less congested conditions (multi    lanes and speeds over 65 mph) i would give 5 stars  .
if you purchase this for the nav then it is a good deal but do not get your hopes up if you plan on using it as a hands free device for your phone  .
the same issue with the second one  .
finally called garmin and discovered that the issue is with the bluetooth  .
the phone i happen to have is not comp[atible with this unit  .
gps is great as long as i dont use the bluetooth  .
havent tried using it with a compatible phone  .
(garming provides a compatiuble phone list on its site) anyway that seemed to solve the locking up issue  .
gps works great as long as the bluetooth is disabled i would be very interested to know if the other reviewers that experience this same issue tried disableing bluetooth or have a compatible phone  .
bottoms line is the gps is great as long as i dont pair it with the phone i currently have so i guess im back to my old head set  .
love the design  .
still figureing out the traffic feature , aside from this im pretty satisfied  .
garmin customer sevice are very helpful updated  .
on jan 15 , 2009  .
pulled it right out of the box , turned it on and started using it immediately  .
very intuitive , just the way i like gadgets  .
probably the most usefule feature for me is the 'points of interest'  .
you can find just about any store in any city  .
it's great , i use it even in my hometown  .
on the negative side , i wish there is a volume dial on the unit  .
it's annoying to have to push two or three buttons to adjust the volume , esp during a bluetooth call  .
the whole point of bluetooth is handsfree , right  .
if i have to fiddle with my hands to adjust volume , what's the point  .
also , it's a pain to disconnect the bluetooth  .
that's about 5 button presses that , and the fact that car phones never sound great anyway i just do not use the bluetooth feature unless i have to  .
other than that , i really like the unit and am very happy with the purchase .
decent product  .
durable , and no major problems after 8 months of use .
bottom line , good gps unit with alot of cool features and downloads .
the topic of gps random shutdown poses a tragic roadblock to functionality    i'd been using this thing a week , is impressed , upgraded the firmware , then on its inaugural roadtrip as my husband's gift we were driving to god's country and the thing just kept shutting down    no warning and we missed turns on route  .
its a complete deal breaker if this thing cr ps out in precipitation conditions if that's even the problem  .
so far reviewing online it seems this random spontaneous shutting down of gps is a problem with prolific references online , but no fixes , and nothing i've been able to get from garmin  .
if no fix is available its back to the store  .
while the garmin unit cost me more money the tom tom overall is a more user friendly unit and in my opinion the interface on the screens have a better layout then the garmin  .
the tom tom website and add on were also much friendlier  .
garmin downloads were confusing and worked poorly  .
the website is extremely slow  .
both item work well overall but my choice between the two would be the tom tom .
it is hard to believe that the potential of this product is limited by the strange design decisions that resulted in reduced readability of the navigation screens and the removal of directional information that is standard on previous models  .
if those items are not important to the user , the garmin 256wt can be an excellent choice at a moderate price .
overall this is a good gps system , but it does not offer anything of value beyond that of the 205w model , which is much cheaper  .
i suppose this device will get you where you want to go , but it neither does so by the shortest route or the fastest time  .
and it often takes one needlessly out of the way  .
i confess that i'm befuddled about the logic programing  .
beware , one needs to refer to legitimate maps when traveling somewhere unfamiliar .
i am a little disappointed with this gps after after i upgraded from my old 200w  .
i bought it for the traffic receiver option  .
but i realized that it is one of the least important things in a gps  .
the poi database is the most important to me because when i'm in a big city and i'm looking for a specific business , i cannot find it most of the time  .
the maps and routing are not that accurate in rural areas  .
i've gotten lost several times using this gps and occasionally when i enter in an address it has no idea where it is  .
if you miss a turn , it does not ask you to make a u turn for the quickest route  .
it tends to avoid u turns even if a u turns could save you 10    15 min  .
the maps are not that accurate and it misses the destinations sometimes by 100's of yards on the positive side , the traffic receiver does work and show delays and optional routes  .
the blue tooth works great and better than some other gps units i've used  .
it is also very quick to lock on a satellite signal this gps is great if you just want to go from address a to b in big cities  .
but if you are looking for poi's i would not recommend it .
may be my gps is defective , but 3 garmin representative did not help me and i returned product to amazon , where i bought this gps  .
now , i am lokking more stable gps , where will be work all components  .
this gps price around $250 and not so cheap .
this is my first experience with a gps , and i am amazed how out of date the maps are even when using the one free update to the latest maps  .
in the area where we live , it has roads that don't exist anymore , and is missing the road to our house  .
google has had this on their maps for years  .
also , the software quality is rather mediocre , given that on day one , we've already had to shutdown/start up the unit several times to get back full control  .
but when it works , it is great  .
maybe we got a lemmon  .
we have all the latest sw and map updates  .
this is really surprising we have not been able to test the traffic feature yet  .
the ads have so far been unintrusive (shown when starting up) .
i'm amzed this got such a good rating by cnet , it's horrible to use takes for ever to find an address or point of interest the real time traffic alert system is a joke feature it comes inc but does little to nothing in updates on traffic i live in silicon valley very very disspointed will not by from this manufacturer again not being a tech guy , i'm assuming the chip is too slow to operate this gps  .
i am disappointed with this unit  .
it lost signal often in manhattan , and left me trying to figure out which turn to make , when i needed its guidance the most  .
the maps are out dated too  .
on one occasion , it guided me to a library that had been closed and relocated for over a year  .
i found it useless on many occasions that i used it on outings with my family  .
it kept getting us lost , especially when voice prompts came too late to do anything about them  .
i had another garmin before this , with all the same bells and whistles , except the volume is on the outside of the unit  .
that made it much easier to control than going through menus .
using a competitor handheld gps for a number of years with no problems , i'm disappointed in garmin automotive units  .
returned two 880's with multiple problems , used four days and three days  .
one 265wt in one day with problems right out of the box  .
all units had multiple freeze ups and maps gone haywire  .
both 880's would send me on a wild recalculated route in the opposite direction after arriving home on a highlighted route .
worthless if it cannot find the road you're on  .
i is given one of these units to get around la    it is a nightmare  .
it would lose signal every few miles causing me to miss meetings and pull over in dangerous places  .
i tried reseting it etc but it is pretty useless .
bought at costco less than a month ago  .
it turns off in mid    use while hooked to charger ; wo not turn back on easily    not sure what the magic combination is to get it to turn on  .
have had other garmin gps' never encountered this problem before  .
although a friend has had the same experience with the same model from the same store .
i called in because my garmin nuvi stopped communicating with my phone  .
i had already downloaded new software and applied any fixes that were available to both the phone and the garmin , but nothing worked  .
since my phone works will all other bluetooth devices that i have , i figured it had to be the garmin  .
after being on hold for almost an hour  .
a guy named marvin answered  .
he literally gave me about one minute , then said he couldn't help me  .
when i said please don't hang up on me , he said i wo not and then put me back in the queue to wait another hour  .
unbelievable  .
the device still is not working with my phone .
after using a magellan gps for 5 years , i decided to replace it with a more more advanced unit  .
i picked the garmin 265wt  .
poor choice  .
the warnings for upcoming turns are given too late  .
the system announces the next turn when you first enter a new road (there could be 200 miles to go before the turn)  .
it does not give you another warning until 3/10 of a mile before the turn  .
this is much too late at 75 miles per hour on highways  .
the magellan announces at 2 miles and again at  .
5 miles to go  .
the turn instructions are also not clear  .
despite being an experienced gps user , i missed a couple of turns in the city because of the confusing display  .
when re    routing , the system announced turns after i had passed the intersection  .
there is a display that tells you how many feet left before a turn  .
it keeps showing 90 to 100 feet left when you are already in the intersection  .
it tells you that you have arrived at your destination when you are still 2 to 3 houses/buildings away .
for the price $300 i paid  .
expect more  .
from west coast to east coast of canada the piece of junk managed to get me to take roads that dead    ended at border crossings 3 times  .
it is set on the fastest route   how is that possible when one has to stay over in the u  .
plus the fact i did not have my passport on me  .
cost me hours of driving and $$$ in fuel  .
no setting to remain in canada  .
never had a problem before with ordinary road maps  .
anybody wanna buy a used one cheap , lol .
i would look elsewhere as the problems i experienced are common with these units  .
look on previous reviews and you will see the same issues over and over again .
avoid this product  .
i even exchanged the first one for another  .
same problems  .
i've driven around the us and europe with this gps , and it almost always fails to create a reasonable route  .
it has directed me over pedestrian    only streets , the wrong way down one    way roads , through the congested centers of old european cities , onto single    lane almost    dirt roads  .
it has directed me to leave the highway to drive on surface streets , and to get onto highways when surface streets are faster  .
it's failed to navigate the highways and city streets of the largest cities in the us as well as the smaller roads of rural towns and suburbs  .
i have no idea where its directions are good , but the one thing i always do before setting out on a trip is to review it to make sure it is not doing something insane the traffic reporting/prediction feature is also completely worthless  .
my nuvi has never accurately reported a traffic condition  .
it reports green when i stuck in traffic (in the middle of los angeles  .
) and red when traffic is moving at the speed limit  .
it reports traffic alerts that never materialize  .
its traffic delay time estimates are worthless if you truly want a laugh , turn on traffic avoidance and watch the terrible routing work together with the incorrect traffic reports to having you driving all over the map   sudden instructions to exit the highway , make u    turns , return to the highway  .
it's pathetic and if this weren't enough , the device is also horribly slow  .
it often lags behind your turns so badly that it decides you are not following its directions  .
and then when it realizes you are , it tries to restore the directions  .
sometimes it gets confused and requires a hard    reboot , but mostly it just takes minutes to restore the route  .
searching for destinations is also woefully slow  .
it can take minutes to return a search for , say , marriot and sometimes fails to return results even when later searches do find them finally , the user interface is a nightmare to navigate  .
it forces you to specify a state to search in , but in some cases still lists destinations thousands of miles away first in the search results , forcing you to scroll through them  .
if you navigate the menus to change a setting , the interface forces you to hit the back button until you get back to the map , which can be quite distracting  .
overall , for a company that has been producing these devices for so many years , it is an embarrassment  .
cnet's positive review of this product casts serious doubt on its objectivity as a review site my advice is to buy a smart phone with a gps enabled and use google maps to navigate instead .
i purchase the nuvi265wt for my daughter , (i have the nuvi 255w what is much better)  .
i thought it is a great buy at $200 and i trusted the garmin name , but i is wrong  .
it looks good and the handsfree is nice  .
but the gps and maps are very poor  .
the unit seems slow and garmin support is non    existent  .
do not buy this unit or any garmin with these maps .
this unit is inaccurate and annoying to use  .
suction cup stopped wkg after a few months and the unit does not have roads that have been around for years inputed which garmin just blames on their provider  .
dont waste you money .
got the unit , followed instructions to register it with garmin and that's the only thing that worked well  .
it then checked for updates to the software and maps and reported that both are current  .
i tried to use it and is directed to enter the freeway at a closed on ramp (we've got a widening project going on , six of the downtown on ramps have been closed for two years    and will stay closed for another 18 months)  .
i called tech support and tried to explain the problem , the first techie said the maps are current and hung up on me  .
the second one said they are out of date , gave me the new version number and told me how to update the maps  .
i tried , but their website says they are current  .
then i found a link where i can pay $119 for updated maps four times a year as long as i own the unit and purchased that option  .
i got the confirmation email with a link to update the maps    i clicked    i got a page not found error  .
all in all i'd say the only thing accomplished here is that garmin has ripped me off for about $475 at this point updated  .
on feb 4 , 2010  .
there are too many things wrong to pick one to start with  .
i bought mine on a black friday deal and have had to exchange it 4 times since then  .
all the units i have exchanged at some point while driving freeze up and reboot requiring the user to re    agree and enter the information again  .
this occurred with and without the unit being plugged into the powersource  .
i corresponded with garmin and they even said the unit is defective  .
but come on , 4 units of the same model in less then a month  .
that tells me it is a flawwed design  .
when it did work , the directions were off and not usually the best route  .
the text to speach at times became garbled or silent for periods of time  .
the traffic updates are slow and inaccurate until it is too late and you are then neck deep in traffic  .
the funny thing is my wife agreed to get this gps if i would stop cursing while driving  .
instead , i curse even more just at the gps instead of the traffic  .
be careful when purchasing this unit , unless that is of course you enjoy being constantly fustrated with a product that is as dependable and valuable as a mcdonald's happy meal toy .
