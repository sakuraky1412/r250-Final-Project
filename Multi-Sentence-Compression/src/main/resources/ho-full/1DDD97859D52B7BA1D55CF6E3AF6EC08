we had a superb stay in maison mk .
this is not your traditional riad but a modern , updated take on a marrakech riad in the heart of the medina .
however , the look and feel of the place is that of an upscale moroccan home , albeit one that has been tastefully renovated with modern amenities pros : • location , location , location .
close enough to a taxi , yet a feel of being in the heart of the medina , and only about 5 to 7 mins walk to the quintessential marrakech destination , jemaa el-fnaa .
• the rooms and most of the space are exceptional .
from the superb lighting in the bedrooms and bathrooms ( truly some of the most innovative and effective use of interior lighting i have seen ) , to the great music available piped into the room ( i want that playlist ) , excellent bathrooms , cell phones provided in each room for the duration of your stay which double as room phones that are programmed with important local numbers .
lots of lovely nooks and corners , a working home theater where you can watch “casablanca” , etc .
• excellent wifi throughout .
• the roof deck , which doubles as the bar , is a great place to unwind and have a drink and/or a snack .
• excellent restaurant and catering on-site ; a modern take on moroccan cuisine , with some western comfort food thrown in .
• as with any hotel , big or small , the staff makes all the difference and here the staff were all wonderful , and we were looked after very well .
cons : • expensive experience .
even in march the price is ~e300 .
( it should be noted that transfers to/from the airport/train station are included ) .
i saw some rooms available at the venerable la mamounia at that price ( obviously without transfers ) , although after visiting that establishment for a drink , it was definitely not our type of marrakech hotel .
all-in-all mk was well worth it for us .
• there is no traditional front desk/lobby , by that i mean the desk is in a very small tight corner by the front door and is mostly unmanned , requiring a short search for a staff/manager , sometimes a few minutes wait outside the front door waiting for someone to let you in .
• no proper bar although it made little difference to us given the beautiful roof area .
• the pool is just a tiny plunge pool for those that might need a pool in the summer .
all-in-all we had a wonderful time and i would strongly recommend maison mk .
