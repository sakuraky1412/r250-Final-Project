Pros:. Excellent Picture Quality, Easy to Use Menu Controls, 4-port USB Hub, 1680 X 1050 Resolution, Faroudja Processor. 
Cons:. Stand is not height adjustable out of the box (add-on required). 
Summary:. I really love connecting my HP laptop to this monitor. I bought this to simulate a desktop environment with my HP laptop, using a Microsoft 4000 ergonomic keyboard, and a Logitech wireless MX Revolution mouse. What a great setup! I compared the monitor against the Samsung, ViewSonic, and other monitors at CompUSA, and this one was by far the best deal. I also like the fact that the monitor base is made of metal in lieu of cheap plastic like many of its competitors. The only other monitor I liked was the Dell Ultrasharp, but I sent that back in January just after purchasing it due to problems with the Dell desktop (learned a lesson there).. The monitor has a great Faroudja processor, excellent front panel touch controls that you really don't even see until you need to (they light up), VGA, component, S-Video and composite video inputs, 1680X1050 resolution, and DVI-D with HDCP input.. Definitely worth every bit of the $350 price at CompUSA!. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, USB hub built in and cridp picture. 
Cons:. You will loose if you buy a Samsung 226W. 
Summary:. I looked at the Samsung 226W @ Bestbuy, however the Gateway FPD2275W was placed right next to it and I started to compare. For the SAME price, the GATEWAY had 4 usb ports built in,strong metal stand was heavy and hard to tip over. The picture was SO much crisper then the Samsung 226B. www.bestbuy.com go get a GATEWAY FPD2275W. I love this monitor because it took 5 minutes to set up and refresh time was great!. 

$$;
Pros:. Large wide screen, HD display, great features and connections, excellent image quality, great looks and versatility.. 
Cons:. I couldn't find anything I didn't like about this monitor.. 
Summary:. The Gateway FPD2275W is a 22-inch wide-screen LCD. It comes loaded with useful features and is easy to use.. The controls are located in the right front bezel. A very light touch is all it takes to turn the monitor on or off and to display the control menu. Only the on/off and menu buttons are seen as tiny blue lighted buttons in the lower right corner. Touch the menu button and the right bezel lights up with the options buttons, and the screen displays a clearly readable menu right next to the buttons. When not in use, the menu buttons are convenienly out of sight.. The monitor has all the same features as the smaller, more expensive Gateway FPD2185W, except for the built-in speakers. An optional speaker bar can be installed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek, USB ports!, connections, great picture. 
Cons:. wish it swiveled like the HP. 
Summary:. I have 2 of these babies side-by-side for my PC and I love them. The picture is bright, crisp, and clear. When I got my second monitor, I was going to get the HP because it swiveled, but then decided to get another Gateway. I'm glad I did.. The touch-screen menus are sooo cool and much nicer than the competitors.It's and HD display...what more can I say? Get these monitors.. P.S.. I HATE Gateway...their computers are junk, but I will give them credit for this monitor- it hasn't given me any problems thus far in the last year.. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid Construction. Lots of inputs.. 
Cons:. Where's the HDMI input?. 
Summary:. I had my heart set on a Samsung until I found this beast. Whereas the new Sams are all cheap plastic, the base of this thing is heavy cast metal and just feels like better quality. Wifey insisted I spend the extra $20 and get something that is obviously much better engineered mechanically than the SAMs or the LGs. Picture is excellent, very little bleed and HL2 looks great. No speakers, but I don't care as they're usually lousy on even the big $ monitors. I originally thought the added USB ports were a gimmick, but I use them all the time. The little audible "music tones" on the control panel are a bit hoakie, but I've had to do very little adjusting so it doesn't matter, All the inputs work great (wish there was an HDMI), but that does give you a PIP option if you need it.. Overall, a big, beefy unit but still very stylish. No regrets.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excelent color, fast motion, performance. PIP is an awesome feature.. 
Cons:. Contrast is good but true black is difficult to obtain due to bright backlight. Controls overly touchy, take getting use to.. 
Summary:. I purchased this monitor primarily for gaming for which it has not disappointed. Minor bleeding of the back light it does not interfere with night time viewing. I would highly recommend this monitor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome display. Xbox via compnent displayed in 1080i, 720p, pip looks good, multiple inputs make it very versatile.. 
Cons:. NO DVI cable, Minor bleed issues at middle of top and bottom, touch buttons a little sensitive at times and not so much at other times. Menu a little awkward.. 
Summary:. Minor light bleed issues at middle of top and bottom, I only really notice this when the monitor is displaying near black, but hardly notice it when Im playing games, watching movies or working on PC. Its something I noticed but only when really looking for it.. The menu takes a little getting used to. The first layer of the menu is ok, but then when you get a layer or two down, its frustrating, especially when the buttons are some times a little too touchy..... I have two of these displays mounted to dual Ergotron Desk mount. DONT FORGET TO ORDER YOUR OWN DVI-D Cables.. To one display I have a switch view hooked up to the VGA port, and my main PC to the DVI. I have a nVidia 8800 GTX just FYI.. The second display is connected to my second DVI-D port on my PC, the component is connected to my Xbox 360 and the composet will soon be connected to my VCR so I can watch TV.. I picked up an HD VGA to Xbox 360 cable. Supposidly VGA will display better than the HD Composite. I was able to display in 1080i &#38; 720p. Dont forget to change your Xbox Display settings, I forgot that the XBox doesnt auto detect the best setting and then display it for you. Picture image looks awesome. I have an older 32 inch CRT we used to play on. My bro-in-law and I prefer to play split screen on this LCD display over the larger tv. Quality is awesome.. Hands down I would buy this display again if I needed one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great value. 
Cons:. No digital cable. 
Summary:. Fantastic monitor! The touch sensitive buttons take some getting used to but work very well! Only problem I had was with the EZtune software, no matter don't really need it anyway. It only comes with analog cable, HD cables are not espensive so thats not a big deal either.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheapest Multi Screen with great quality. 
Cons:. Back light bleeding. 
Summary:. I've always had a stigma with gateway products which stems from my early computer years with their proprietary parts and ... ahhhh nevermind... thats just probably my experience. Overcoming my pass, I stumbled upon the FPD2275W.. I was in the market for an LCD that was 22 or large and about $650 or cheaper. In that price range there are lots you can choose from, but to find one that has DVI,VGA,S-video,composite and component inputs will narrow your choices to the Gateway FPD2275W and the Dell 2407WFP.. I have the 24" Dell at work and it is awsome, virtually flawless save for the tricky button menus. The 24" Dell even has a smaller footprint than my 20 Viewsonic LCD. But with the Gateway having such a good price advantage, it was hard for me to deny it.. The Gateway is not a (5) star unit as I ranked it, it's more like 4.5. There is backlight bleeding on the very top and the very bottom of the screen, for me it is a disfavor but others may differ. I only notice it when I'm looking for it, and it is only visible when the very edges of the screen has a black color. Pip is great and has options for resizing, switching, transparentcy control.. I strongly suggest getting the optional stand. Gateway has it for $70.+ shipping, I got it on Ebay for $48 shipped, brand new. The option stand will give you the swivel feature, tilt, height adjustment,(4) extra usb ports in addition to the monitor's (4) for a total of eight and lastly a rotate feature where you can easily rotate the monitor 90 degrees. The included gateway software will enable your monitor to detect when it has been rotated and 3-4 seconds later the image, desktop, icons etc will all rotate to suit this orientation. This is great for photos, word documents or whatever thats suitable with a vertical view. To go back to widescreen format just rotate the screen again and 3 seconds later it will reorient itself automatically. I have found that on the first rotation, the screen should be rotated clockwise to trigger the auto-sensor, then counter clockwise to revert to widescreen format. The Dell 2407wfp does not have this feature.. The menu system is great, the buttons embeded in the panel and is activited by a slight pass of the finger over them. The image quality is also great I was supprised as to how it handled my s-video signal, now as so as my HD cables come in I'll put that to the test too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Features, and more Features. 
Cons:. no height adjustment. 
Summary:. STOP looking this is the one. 

$$;
Pros:. bright, portrait mode, rich color. 
Cons:. now i want another one. 
Summary:. Actually bought this monitor to use as a 2nd monitor with my 23" HP for mail and stuff. After firing it up, it became my primary monitor. I sprung for the optional stand and already had the DVI cable. I was truly impressed. Only drawback is now I want another one to replace my 23" HP monitor and i'll move that to the bedroom for a tv monitor.. One odd thing. When I put the optional stand on, it actually made my pages upside down in portrait mode even though I had followed directions correctly. Had to re-mount it on the stand but now it works just great, plus I now know EIGHT USB ports in my monitor. A little overkill, but witht he monitor switching between portrait and landscape, its best to just plug things into the base.. 

$$;
Pros:. Right out of the box, I plugged this monitor into my computer and turned it on. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the picture...it was incredible. Text was crystal clear and precise.. 
Cons:. The only cons I can think of are that it is not height adjustable, and you have to purchase a DVI cable separately.. 
Summary:. I started my 22 inch LCD monitor quest with the Samsung 225BW. The picture was ok, but the text was horrible. The stand it came on was extremely flimsy, and wobbled a great deal, with even the slightest bump of my desk. After using the Samsung for one day, I brought it back to BestBuy, and exchanged it for the Gateway. Without even installing the supplied color management software that came with the Gateway, the picture from the second I turned it on was simply incredible. Hardly any noticeable backlight bleeding, the colors are incredible crisp, and the text is laser sharp. I would very highly recommend this monitor to anyone in the market for a very reasonably priced 22 inch LCD monitor..

Pros:. Crystal clear text, minimal backlight bleeding, incredible picture.

$$;
Pros:. Lots of bang for the buck, plenty of surface area, more features than most of us need or use. 
Cons:. No included DVI connector, a few extra expenses, a few dinky gripes. 
Summary:. 1680x1050 for $400 is pretty good, huh? The only catch is that you're going to have to spring a little more for a DVI cable, because for some insane reason, it includes instead a VGA connector. It's got a VGA port, too, by the way. Don't ever connect the VGA port to your computer--ever. It's not pretty, and it might mislead you to think the monitor has problems. It doesn't. It's just that VGA can't handle 1680x1050 resolution. Still, $450 for 1680x1050 is still pretty good.. The FPD2275W has a built-in 5 port USB connector, and I actually found myself using it. It also comes bundled with additional software designed to let you rotate the screen to portrait mode like its older 21" cousin, the FPD21something--which is odd, because the FPD22something lacks the 21something's swivelling stand. (Gateway offers a stand as an accessory on its web site for an additional $60. Huh. You'll be glad to know the power cord is included. I do plan to get this accessory, by the way, since $510 for 1680x1050 or 1050x1680 is still a good deal.). The "few dinky gripes" mentioned above refers primarily to the menu, or rather the blingy noises it makes when it comes up. You can turn it off, but to do so, you have to listen to it blare at you while you look for the setting. Still, a touch-sensitive control contoured into the side is pretty slick.. 

$$;
Pros:. Colors are sharp. 
Cons:. Touch controls. 
Summary:. Although I like the onboard setup featues, I'm not too sure I care for the touch buttons. Other than that, I hooked my Directv HD up via the DVI port and the picture quality is awesome. PIP works great, can watch the game and work at the same time, hotkeys allow quick swaping between inputs.. 

$$;
Pros:. USB ports included. 
Cons:. A little expensive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wonderful color, design, awesome display, great functionality, very sturdy stand to support weight. 
Cons:. The 1yr. standard warranty is NOT sufficient coverage to protect your investment, menu buttons too sensitive. 
Summary:. I have happily owned and operated the Gateway FPD2275W 22"-inch LCD Monitor for the past 18 months; until it went out last week! Luckily I thought to purchase a 2yr. Carry In/Exchange Extended Warranty Plan through my local retailer CompUSA. Panic soon set in when news reached my ears that CompUSA had gone out-of-business and that there were no local stores to exchange the unit. I quickly accessed the company website via another computer to gather more information. Fortunantely for me some of the company assets/locations nationwide were purchased by TigerDirect. I called TAP (Technology Assurance Program) and the service provider (to my surprise) processed my order for a 2-3 business day exchange. My replacement should arrive tomorrow hopefully without further incident. Word to the Wise: Purchase an extended warranty plan that offers replacement coverage on this or any other brand LCD Monitor. In my opinion LCD's (unlike CRT's) are relatively new to the marketplace and have yet to be proven by consumers to show longevity. There is no guarantee that any of them will last past the initial mfg. warranty period. Hindsight is 20/20 I should have known better when I saw other brands were offering 1-2 yrs. longer on their period of coverage. Boy was I wrong! Now the real challenge comes when gauging the performance of the new replacement. Will it perform as well as my old unit + have extended life? The jury is still out and rest assured I will let you know what happens. B-T-W I will lose the balance of my 2yr. warranty coverage (6 months left) when the replacement arrives. My next question to the rep.--&gt; What if the replacement unit goes out? The representative told me they will only guarantee the replacement unit for 30 days! After that all bets are off! So I carefully read my contract and discovered that the rep. was indeed correct--&gt; the coverage is for a ONE-TIME replacement only! In conclusion, All things considered I figure that I faired well in this instance. I am getting my Gateway 22" LCD Monitor replaced by a company that is no longer in business but is willing to honor its prior commitment on the extended warranty agreement. It could've been worse--&gt; I could be left with a dead Gateway 22" LCD Monitor and have to absorb the cost of a replacement to boot!. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks nice, reasonable display performance, cheap. 
Cons:. Short warranty, no repair options when it breaks!!. 
Summary:. This week, my Gateway 22" stopped working entirely -- black screen, no LEDs, and even sparking sounds coming from the back when plugged in. Got on the tech support chat, learned that it's 1 month out of warranty, and they told me to call Service Operations at 877-285-6043.. Immediately became concerned, once they mentioned that Gateway service is merged with eMachines service -- I've had incredibly poor experience with both eMachines products and their service department before.. My worst fears were realized. After telling them I have an out-of-warranty monitor needing repair, I waited on hold for a minute. I was then told that "we have no procedure for" repairing out-of-warranty monitors!! They simply DO NOT work on them. Period. Even for a fee. She suggested I "find a local repair shop" to do the work.. I DO NOT recommend this monitor, due to the 1 year warranty and dead-end life cycle. I have replaced the monitor with a Dell 22" which has a 3 year warranty.. Consider yourself warned!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Display and Featurs, like PIP and DCD, and Component connection. 
Cons:. Tech Support is Bad (eMachine runs it) no wonder, Monitor goes devective after couple of months,. 
Summary:. I thought Gateway Products was good until i bought this monitor.. I will never buy Gateway again.. Same goes for Tech-Support.. 

$$;
Pros:. Brilliant colors and clarity. The wide screen really makes viewing easier. Multiple inputs give it excellent flexibility.. 
Cons:. 1 year warranty. The invertor went bad in less than 2 years. Gateway will not support equipment out of its warranty period. No parts list available for replacement parts.. 
Summary:. I really enjoyed the picture quality and size of this monitor. The unit even has USB ports that can be used for other peripherals. I am very disappointed however with Gateways lack of support just because this monitor is out of warranty. I disaasembled the unit to troubleshoot and found the invertor board has what appears to be water damge. Gateway will not sell replacement parts or repair it even for a charge. I believe this monitor should have lasted longer than 2 years as the specifications for the lamps is 40,000 to 50,000 hours. This total lack of suppoprt is the reason this will be my last Gateway.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good quality picture. 
Cons:. DVI port quits working. 
Summary:. My monitor is less than two years old. About 2-months ago The screen went black - no signal. I hooked up the monitor to my computer using the VGA cable and the monitor worked again.. I tried another monitor with the same DVI cable I was using and it too worked. The problem is the DVI port on the monitor itself. If you check the internet, you'll find plenty of complaints about this monitor and specifically the failing DVI port. Gateway will not honor fixing this monitor, even if you're willing to pay for it's repair. This is apparently a common defect with this piece of "j-- equipment".. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice monitor when it worked.. 
Cons:. Rediculous service policy and very short warranty. Essentially a throw away. My last Gateway after being a customer for over twenty years.. 
Summary:. No way to get this monitor serviced. Gateway refers you to BestBuy who want $85 to ship it and about $150 to open it up. Power loss is a very common problem with these monitors due to bad inverters but Gateway has abandoned their customers who seek a reasonable repair. My first Gateway was a 386 machine in the late 1980's when Ted Waite was still running the show. This monitor was my last purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good while it ran, usb plugs and all. 
Cons:. Owned less then two years. Went blank....next time I look for 3 years coverage.. 
Summary:. Boat load of junk....Next time a better monitor with 3 years coverage... 

$$;
Pros:. Great when it was working for the first 12 months.. 
Cons:. I purchased three of these monitors and after 12 months one of them lost its picture. at the end of the next seven months the second one lost its picture. have gotten no where with gateway their customer sucks in my experience.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear, Sharp display, easy to use settings. 
Cons:. Poor warranty, Poor customer service. 
Summary:. I really had no complaints about this monitor...until it died on me 1 month and 2 days out of warranty. Even then, I probably would have a better review to give if it werent for Gateway's complete lack of customer service. 3 months ago I was having a separate problem with this monitor, the display picture was shifting off the screen, but they failed to document it at Gateway and now its out of warranty, so I am out of luck. Here's one customer who will NEVER buy Gateway again..
