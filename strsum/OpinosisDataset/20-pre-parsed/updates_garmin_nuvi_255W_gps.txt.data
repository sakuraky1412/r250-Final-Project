_________________________ update__________________________

> links up flawlessly to my mac using garmin roadtrip, webupdates, etc .

the maps seem to be fairly updated .

,  speed of map updates is awesome .

easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .

more often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .

the map update was about 2gb in size .

it's a curiousity for most of us, traffic and content updates   .

this clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .

update and reroute much _more_ quickly than my other gps   .

,  no traffic update but don't really need it

use the  webupdater  so that the unit is running at its peak .

otherwise you can't update the maps !

getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .

loading a map update is another experience i won't go into .

then it said i needed to update some software i said ok .

we started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot c330 which was a dream .

i ran the updater and there was an upgrade for the software and text for jack tts and samantha tts .

mapsource also makes it easy to update your unit's map annually .

glad i updated the map and software .
