i is torn between keeping my beloved blackberry or switching to the trendy iphone  .
i debated right up to my purchase  .
since then i have not looked back , nor regreted my decision  .
it did take 1    2 weeks while i familiarized myself with the iphone and its settings , apps and intricacies  .
i tried to learn one or two new shortcuts each day and googled when i needed answers  .
the reception is fabulous  .
i can hear people talking to me with no problem and can still turn the volume up if needed  .
the sheer number of apps available for everything under the sun is a huge plus in my book  .
i feel very organized and like i have the world at my fingertips  .
user friendly comes to mind often  .
keep in mind , there is a learning curve , but that is the case with any new phone unless you're buying the same phone in an updated version  .
i absolutely love my iphone and do not regret purchasing it rather than the bb torch  .
for me , the iphone takes care of my every need and some  .
hopefully this is the phone for you as well updated  .
on nov 13 , 2010  .
more    glass back   sleek yes , but would not a steel back like the steel band going around it be better  .
it would definitely make the phone more sturdy    antenna issue   yes noticeable , but with the glass back you want a case anyways  .
i got this belkin case that just covers the back and sides in a clear plastic  .
the case allows the phone to still look sleek without having an annoying case on it  .
in the end its not a major turn of    yeah and folder really need more than 12 apps     .
bottom line i love this phone  .
my droid using friends are always trying to compare phone specs in casual conversations , but i know they like my phone  .
that's why they always bring it up .
screen resolution is amazing  .
phone quality so    so  .
the number of applications is astounding and the operating system is very intuitive    what's hard to learn is what you can do with it , not the how to do it part .
this phone is almost perfect  .
if it is on verizon and had flash it would be the best by far .
get the iphone 4 would will not regret it   d  .
the apple people obviously get it  .
this phone delivers what others (phone companies , telecom manufacturers) have been promising since the mid    1990s  .
the user interface is so fluid , so intuitive , the phone is an extension of your body customize it the way you want  .
put on it the tools and applications that you need  .
you choose  .
because of this flexibility , every person's iphone is actually a different smartphone  .
yet we all start from the same phone  .
one model with all of the top    notch features (stereo bluetooth , wifi , 3g , hd camera , gps , compass , )  .
just pick from the 150 , 000+ software apps (half of them free) on the apple app store to make it into the phone that fits your needs one of the best parts of the iphone is that the cellphone carrier hasn't tinkered with it by installing useless stuff designed to increase your phone bill  .
look at any other phone and you will see that verizon/at t/sprint/ they add their own software and basically cripple the phone  .
not with the iphone    apple obviously insisted that at t sell the iphone the way that apple has designed it i would not go back to any other phone .
slick , modern , a work of art  .
not the best phone , but a polished ui with a huge community of apps that does everything an android can do an more  .
the camera take amazing pictures and videos  .
the front facing camera is fun and works seamlessly  .
now with the yahoo app , video chat is easy over 3g  .
the att data cap is annoying but necessary to prevent other data hogs from ruining it for the rest of us  .
the free att wifi is nice , but the data should be roll over and tethering should add data and not just pull out of the same pool  .
wish there is a mobile hot spot , but i've heard that the evo's sucks batter life out so fast not a big deal if you just plug it in bottom line everything is just more polished and tested  .
blackberry's are frustratingly crappy , androids do not quite stack up with their pixelated mess of a fragmented ui experience and the new win7 phone seems like a complicated mess  .
simplicity is king  .
i wish the sync with itunes could be less constrained and allow you to go from computer to computer uploading and downloading things as you please  .
good thing there is iphone explorer  .
i had a htc droid from verizon before the iphone  .
the 3g coverage with verizon is perhaps a little better but that's about the only thing i can say is superior to the iphone  .
everything else with iphone is hands down better by far  .
when i tried to connect to wifi with droid it is always a struggle but with iphone it is seamless  .
droid apps were easy to download but i never figured out how to delete them  .
with iphone there is no problems with app deletion or addition  .
droid would freeze up at times and i'd have to remove the battery and then put it back in , with iphone no such problem  .
battery life even with the extended battery in droid is no where near the life of iphone  .
i liked my email , calender and igoggle web based services with droid but i is able to transfer them to iphone app without a hitch  .
i can go on and on , but if you want a successful business get iphone .
i tried the compromised    hello , android    and none could measure up  .
i switched from verizon after 12 years just to get the iphone and could not be happier .
battery life is better , it's thin , the cameras are great and the ability to find my phone if lost  .
i use it as my only phone  .
i do not feel there is a need for a backup land line  .
the ability to carry one device for so many functions ; helps with my clutter reduction .
definitely worth buying  .
my first and last cellphone now from on were iphones  .
i had an iphone 3g and always liked it  .
now , i have iphone 4 and it's a very better , faster phone then the 3g  .
it's always fun to use it  .
typing on the keyboard is a joy  .
everything on the iphone is super cool  .
well , what a nice device  .
buy it  .
i owned the iphone 3g for 2 years and loved it  .
i didn't think that anyone could improve upon the design , but apple did  .
i'm sure you've read all of the other reviews , so you probably already know the pros and cons  .
i would say that i haven't experienced any of the signal loss , even when i hold it with the death grip  .
but since i got a free case , it would be a moot point anyhow  .
at t still sucks , and sometimes calls are dropped , but it has gotten better in the past 2 years  .
and i do not use it as a phone too often anyhow i'm sure that there are some other nice phones out there , but it's going to be really hard to be this one .
the iphone 4 is good because of its features , speed , and overall good design  .
first off it has a forward facing camera which few other phones have  .
second it has more apps that run faster than android apps  .
third it is overall a nicer product because it is simple to use , easy to navigate , i give it five stars .
its soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good  .
this iphone4 is really the smartphone to beat  .
it has a full feature set now including the best camera on mobile device  .
its only going to get better with the upcoming software updates .
i have never had one call quality or reception problem at all  .
it works as it is supposed to  .
i have very good service everywhere that i have not had with previous phones  .
the camera is very very good quality especially the hd recording  .
can use it all day without having to charge it  .
the retina display is amazing  .
if you havent seen the retina display then you havent seen a high quality screen before  .
it is by far the highest resolution display i have ever seen  .
i have not had any problems with it at all  .
it is the perfect phone .
no one produces a complete product like apple  .
hardware manufacturers will try to stuff more things into a phone to try and beat the iphone hardware and google will try to beat apple on the os , but neither can integrate the two like apple does  .
this is why the iphone always feels right when you use it .
have had for about 3 months has not dropped one call has been reliable except for for at t towers keep going out every time it rains the real weeknes of the iphone is at t .
i have owned all versions of the iphone  .
never had a problem  .
i is skeptical and disappointed when i read all the negative publicity about the latest version  .
i is bored , wanted a new toy so to speak and went to my local at t store  .
i played around with other non    apple phones and although is impressed , i felt like i would have buyers remorse  .
i also played with the iphone 4 and saw that there is no noticeable signal issue when i put on the death grip  .
by pure luck as i is looking at droid phones , a very nice employee told me that a shipment of 32 gb version 4s arrived  .
i bought one and thought about selling it on ebay for a profit , then wait on newer version  .
instead , i sold my 3gs for $350  .
00 with the buy it now feature in less than 5 minutes          no exaggeration  .
i have learned that the media is not always right , and of course forums , although informative , are nothing more than (often biased) opinions this is by far the best phone i have ever owned  .
i have nothing against people who choose other phones , but i am happy with what i have  .
nothing negative to report at all  .
it seems like so many people are so passionate about what phone they have after reading so many forums i say get what makes you happy  .
a friend of mine is on her 5th palm pre , and it broke again today after 3 days  .
it seems like droid users really go overboard when they post opinions  .
i think the iphone 4 is the best of the best that is out there currently  .
i researched droid a lot  .
does the android market even have a search feature for a specific app  .
to anyone considering a new phone , i encourage you to give the iphone 4 a try  .
if you do not like it , just take it back  .
i do not recommend taking it off your list because of what you read either i am the only guy in the world that got a properly functioning iphone 4 in the world or the negative publicity is not as accurate as one may think  .
it almost scared my off , but i am very happy with my purchase  .
my phone works flawlessly no matter what grip i have on it , and no calls have dropped to date i wonder what the resale value is on droid phones vs  .
iphone  .
i wonder what percentage of people that are droid fanatics also have an ipod  .
if you are in the market for a phone , i say do your research but keep an open mind  .
i am not a fanboy (first time i ever used that word) by any stretch of the imagination  .
i by products that i find to work the best for me  .
i am glad i did not wait for the next version of the iphone or switch product brands  .
if you can find one , i encourage you to at least try it  .
i could have sold my new phone online for a grand but i have what i like and am happy  .
i hope this review helps  .
i try not to have any bias if i review something  .
like i said earlier , get the phone that works best for you updated  .
on aug 15 , 2010  .
i came from a 3g and before that from windows phones  .
the 3g is a marvel next to my htc windows phones  .
the iphone 4 is almost as great an improvement  .
i have had no problems and my reception is significantly better than my 3g or any of my htc phones  .
if you are someone who just wants a phone/mobile computer that works , not something that requires you to tinker than this is an excellent choice for you  .
and i actually do own this phone  .
i've never used a smart phone that ran as seamlessly as the iphone 4  .
so much you can do , yet so simple to operate all i wanted is a phone that allowed me to listen to music , surf the internet , check e    mail (a must for work) , take nice photos and videos , and of course make phone calls  .
this phone does all of that , and does it well , with a simple interface that works seamlessly and is very intuitive the screen on this thing is freaking amazing  .
not worth saying much more , i just can  .
t describe it , you have to see it if you use a smart phone a lot , then battery life becomes something you pay attention to  .
if you just want to charge up at night and last the whole day , this phone has you covered  .
it might even last you two days  .
i travel a lot for work , and i use to have to carry extra batteries around with me , not anymore  .
can  .
t say enough about not having to worry about charging at home , at the office , and in the car  .
i just don  .
t have to think about it anymore  .
this type of battery life with the capabilities/power of the iphone are just something i  .
ve never seen before  .
at the end of my work day , i  .
ve still got 80% of my battery left , just awesome the two big hits i keep hearing about the phone include   the antenna problems and it doesn  .
t offer  .
true  .
multi    tasking first , the antenna problem doesn  .
t really exist for me  .
yes , if i cover that specific part of the phone up i can watch the signal drop (and i do have field test mode activated , so i have a lot better idea about the actual reception than if i were just looking at bars [right now sitting on the desk it  .
s at    91db , with the death grip it drops to    100 db]) , but it has yet to result in any difference in call quality  .
in fact , i now get reception in places i never had with my previous att phone  .
if we didn  .
t have these little bars or field test modes , we might never know about this  .
problem  .
, we might even think it  .
s a pretty good improvement  .
having said all that , i  .
m happy to be receiving a nice new free case from apple , not because i need it , but because i really would like to protect this phone as for the  .
true  .
multi    tasking , i  .
m not sure who decided this wasn  .
true  .
multi    tasking , cause it certainly allows me to do multiple things at once , such as listen to pandora , surf the internet , check my e    mail while i download a youtube video , ect  .
fact is , i haven  .
t yet found what it can  .
t do as far as multi    tasking , although i  .
m sure there  .
s something that someone might want to do that it can  .
t , and that  .
s reason enough for them to point a finger , yell  .
ah ha  .
, and claim it doesn  .
t really multi    task  .
for me , i haven  .
t seen the limitations that are implied all over the web  .
in the real world , this works great i now must sound like a fanboy , and i guess i just might be now  .
when a product exceeds your expectations , and works so well , it  .
s hard not to appreciate it .
bought at the apple store while on vacation , so i could spend my vacation learning to play with the new phone  .
apple has superb customer service  .
they transferred all my data and contacts from the old set to the new  .
apple products are so intuitive and this is so sleek and elegant yet so functional .
i've been on verizon for 6 years and is ready for a change  .
the service is overall ok , but honestly , i personally did not have perfect can you hear me now reception on my phone  .
when i travel , i always had more bars than my friends on sprint or att , but i rarely travel and can survive a few days without reception  .
the problem is that in my apartment , the reception on verizon lacks a bit compared even to my work nextel phone  .
i had a tour , so i know i had a quality phone  .
because of that , and the fact i had one of the last $175 etf contracts , i figured if i is going to try an iphone , now would be the time i am extremely pleased with the decision  .
i've spent a lot of time playing with the incredible and the droid x in the verizon stores trying to contemplate this decision  .
for me , apple's os is much better than androids  .
i understand not everyone is going to agree with that , which is fine  .
the point of the review is that the iphone bashing is a bit out of hand  .
this is a top    notch phone  .
it's weird that the same people who complain about the iphone needing a case to make calls are the same people who value their android and blackberries so much they put a case on it to protect it  .
seriously , who buys a $300 phone and then leaves it without a case  .
the death grip is the biggest non    issue in the history of electronics the phone itself is amazing  .
coming from a blackberry , its night and day to view webpages and see html email , not having to hit the more button on long emails , and being able to get some functionality from the web  .
the web browser is smoother than the stock options on any android phone , though i am aware android has some very nice 3rd party options  .
the screen itself is incredible  .
daylight viewing is perfect , and the resolution is astounding  .
apple's operating system is intuitive  .
you really don't even need to read the owner's manual to figure out anything  .
i am not a tech savvy person , i'm middle range , so this is perfect for me  .
i understand many people who are better with this stuff than me would prefer android for it's openness and customization  .
i feel good about what i can do here with iphone i text alot , and the keyboard is about as good as a touchscreen can get  .
i feel with practice i can get close to the speed of my blackberry tour , which is saying alot  .
finally , the reception is not an issue  .
i'm in a chicago suburb , so i do not have the well known sf or ny issues , and i love the reception so far  .
i do understand though that a phone is only as good as the area you use it in  .
for me , this is fine the front facing camera seems to be a non    issue i admit  .
i cannot see facetime picking up , regardless of the wi    fi requirement or not  .
people nowadays want to limit their committment to communication  .
that is why texting is so popular  .
a phone call itself requres a great degree of attention  .
facetime chat basically requires someone who already has add to sit there and stare at their screen for an hour  .
it'll reallly only work for long distance relationships  .
but i can now throw out my standalone camera (an older , 5 mp) and just use this  .
the photos are amazing , and consistently rate higher than any other phone out there  .
my biggest thing is that if you've been like me with this phone and been on the fence with it for years , break down and buy it  .
give it a try before you assume it's garbage or that android is a viable option  .
to me , android is only an option for the extremely tech savy or people who just hate apple  .
most of the stuff droid does is not needed by most of the people who would buy an android  .
i admit android has more carriers which is a huge advantage , and google maps is superior on android , but iphone is my phone of choice and i have no regrets  .
updated  .
on aug 5 , 2010  .
note   i have a htc hd2 , (bad video playback , buggy software) is given a free case by t    mobile at the time of purchase  .
the htc hd2 , without the rubber case , the htc    hd2 looses reception in the left corner (fast) too  .
the apple iphone is the best out there i think that reviewers should test all smart phones , especially by htc (htc hd2) before slamming the apple iphone , which has a superior smart phone and os .
i was not a fan of apple until i both this phone  .
i had the 3g and thought it is good but lacked a decent camera and is slow , but the 4 just blows it away  .
it changed my entire phone experience  .
the screen is crisp beyond belief so looking at photos or videos is amazing  .
this device is arguably the best tech purchase i've made , it's really that good what impressed me the most besides the ridiculously amazing screen is the quality of the photos and video  .
for such a small device , it's incredible  .
i is looking for something to replace having to carry around a point    and    shoot camera and video  .
this is it  .
the speed over the previous 3g also remarkable , you can take photos very quickly  .
i'd love to see some apps tailored to this that take advantage of this hardware a lot of people talk about the reception issue , i have not experienced any difficulties  .
i've tried the death grip , nothing happens  .
if anything , my reception is actually better now also , the responsiveness is such a great leap over the 3g , i'm real impressed my only grip , and it's more of a wish list rather than a grip , is that the camera ui could do with more features or adjustable options , that would be very cool you really have to spend some time to realize just how amazing this device is because it really grows on you  .
if you are on the market for a phone , this is the device to buy .
best phone and the music player is the best on a phone and easy to put music on the phone  .
best phone on the market bar    none .
the iphone 4 is very beautiful to behold and to use , the retina display looks sharp and clear  .
text and images are stunning and video is just perfect  .
the camera takes great photos and video is amazing (imovie is a must for this phone) it has so many features and it's simple and fun to use the phone  .
ipod sounds great and with ios 4 it has so much to offer users i have not experienced the signal loss , worst i have managed is 1 bar loss far less than some other phones i have seen  .
vodaphone in the uk is fine , no call drops no issues with the proximity sensor either  .
a case however is a must , the glass back could be easily damaged  .
i still prefer the shape of the 3gs over the new one but it's still a great phone battery life is fine not perfect but better than previous iphones , 2 days with good use between charges , about the same as my old 3gs which i still wo not part with great phone by apple but the long term wear on the glass back worries me , this phone could be prone to damage over time far worse than older models  .
hopefully i will be proved wrong .
i just love it the processor is so fast , everything loads immediately , the apps look great , and calls are clearer then on prev  .
iphone , it sounds like you are next to them  .
i'm in phoenix and i've never had problems with dropped calls or lack of service  .
oh , one other thing , when you first get it because of the non rounded sides , it feels like you will drop it easily  .
after you get used to the shape it does not feel like that anymore .
very clear display  .
easy to make or receive calls even when using an app or checking email or surfing the net  .
bluetooth easy to set up and use  .
my garmin has bluetooth , so use this in the car  .
can get a tethering plan on this phone too  .
love being able to use my iphone as modem when traveling or away from wifi  .
much lower cost than a card  .
i cannot imagine anyone using such a top    notch phone without protecting it with a case anyway  .
i really enjoy this phone (my second iphone)  .
i use the alarm , love the alerts for appointments , use the calendar a lot and all these sync with my macbook (also syncs to a pc) , check weather on accuweather , the weather channel , etc  .
with the apps  .
check plane schedules and cancellations with travel apps  .
really like the iphone  .
been using one 2+ years .
this is a good phone  .
i love it  .
actually the first generation iphone opened my eyes to how great apple products are  .
from then on , i always get the new one that comes out  .
i also switched to macbooks  .
nothing compares to their performances .
this is the best phone on the market  .
iphone combines what has been great about there phone with excellent new features  .
my mother hates phones and even she can work my iphone  .
iphone has always been simple but now it is also high powered .
this phone is hands down the best smart phone to date  .
it's elegant look and gorgeous display stand way ahead of any htc or motorola android device out there  .
it's camera is stunning and the video capabilities take amazing hd quality movies all of the hoopla over the antenna issue is all for nothing  .
everyone puts a case on their phone which eliminates the issue that occurs on every smart phone  .
after apple being in the phone business for 5+ years , i guess the competitors and the media were happy to fuel a story and blow it out of proportion  .
the crazier the story , the more website hits and commercial advertising revenue competition is good for apple and consumers , it makes them deliver better products each time  .
but lets get real , apple draws news , anything they do makes front page papers  .
dell knowingly sold faulty computers over a two year span , it may have gotten 1 day of media attention  .
if this is apple , the story would of went on for years  .
apple sells news and making any type of news involving apple makes money for the news publication  .
the others story such as 3 million iphone 4s sold in 3 weeks , apple overtaking rim as the number 1 smart phone company , 4 billion app downloads are all trumped a little piece of news called antennagate  .
i am more than happy with the phone , i know 5 people with the iphone 4 and they love their phones  .
do not listen to the haters out there , this is an awesome product .
as an it professional , i've seen / used / setup many different phones  .
in all of those , the apple iphone always gets the most appreciation for being such a great product  .
without a doubt , the iphone 4 is the best phone again , it has set a standard for others to follow and because of this , we , the users , benefit tremendously  .
thank you apple rfsjr  .
i love this phone  .
it obviously will do everything you need a phone to do but it does so much more , all packed into a cool looking device  .
it is really fast so you can surf the web without frustration  .
it is easy to use  .
the front facing camera not only works for facetime video phone calls (similar to skype) but also very useful for self portraits (now you can finally see what you are taking a photo of)  .
the texting app is awesome  .
it can filter email accounts all into one inbox  .
it can group emails threads of the same chain into one line (you'll basically love how the email app works)  .
you can copy/paste text  .
not to mention all the other apps (i only use about 20 apps but i love how each of them work) basically , i've had my iphone a few weeks and i love it  .
i cannot compare it to any other phone since i only own the iphone  .
but i can say that it is an awesome device .
fantastic device  .
all the criticisms are way over    hyped by people that have never used one  .
imo , this device blows away the older iphone models thanks apple for another great product  .
updated  .
on aug 13 , 2010  .
i simply cannot put this phone down  .
i want wait to use it  .
i ordered it online and set it up myself  .
super easy to set up  .
i wish i purchased an iphone years ago .
the iphone 4 is a solid upgrade for even users with a 3gs if eligible  .
the simple to use interface makes this phone a powerful upgrade to even people with limited tech savvy potential .
do not believe the hype of the misinformation campaign launched by the lame stream technical media who want to find something they can criticize apple about  .
the iphone 4 is best in class .
while some have had issues with the antenna , i along with everyone i know that has one , have not for myself there is nothing wrong with this phone and i think how it is preseved is its only con  .
i have owned all iphones except for the 3g this is deff the best one .
it has transformed the way i use a phone ; it has put the world    wide web in my pocket 24/7 .
the best phone i've used on the best network  .
editorial review says at t is a sticking point , yet , test    after    test proves that at t's network is the best nationally and internationally  .
you cannot go wrong with this combination .
i went from iphone 3g to iphone 4 , and it is a massive upgrade  .
my 3g is getting almost unusable it is so slow , and the camera is so poor i couldn't actually use it in real life situations  .
these were my two biggest issues with the 3g and it all changed with the iphone 4 i didn't actually realize how much i would like the screen when i went to the iphone 4 , but it has turned into my favorite feature (if you can call it that)  .
going back and looking at my 3g is almost painful  .
even the resolution on my macbook pro looks like poo after looking at the 4's screen  .
it has 4 times the resolution of the previous generation iphones and matches many computer monitors in resolution  .
all this packed into a 3  .
5 inch screen makes for a screen where you see absolutely no pixelation  .
the camera doesn't have the biggest megapixel count of the smart phone market , but it does have a back    illuminated sensor which lets more photons in through the lens to the sensor , and if you'll ask any photography pro they'll tell you that it's not the megapixel count that makes a good picture , but the lens + sensor  .
if you don't believe me , look at this untouched photo , in low light , i took of the sunset in my front yard http  //tweetphoto  .
com/29764833  .
video  .
this is something that is missing from the iphone 3g and added to the 3gs (which i never upgraded to)  .
this has also become a feature i've used a lot of  .
it has completely replaced my video camera it's that good  .
having little kids with grandparents in another state , this has become a great way to record and upload to facebook all right there on my phone  .
this is especially nice to have because i can use imove for iphone ($4  .
99 extra through the app store) to edit videos right on my phone  .
now i can put a bunch of clips together along with photos , transitions , and music from my library facetime is exactly as advertised  .
works really well , although only on wifi (so you cannot do it on the go) and only to other iphone 4's  .
i understand there are very few phones out there that could take advantage of this feature , but it would be nice to chat with someone on their computer  .
i suspect skype will have an app in the near future , but at this point it doesn't now for the antenna issue  .
i have been able to get reception degradation when i hold the phone wrong way , but never to the point where i could lose a call , and only when i is specifically trying to cover multiple parts of the phone in an odd , unnatural way  .
the truth of the matter is that i have fewer dropped calls and better reception with the iphone 4 than i did with the iphone 3g , so i personally believe this whole antenna issue (which can be duplicated with other phones too , such as the nexus one android phone) is all over    hyped  .
if you doubt that's true , then ask yourself why cnet and all the other review sites that reviewed the iphone 4 before the antenna issue is hyped , never even mentioned it  .
you would think these review sites that do thorough examinations of the phone would have come across it , yet nobody mentions it unless it is reviewed after the hype is created (cnet even says they are going to edit their own review after the fact to add in stuff about the antenna issue) all    in    all , do not let the fear , uncertainy , and doubt that people try to project onto the iphone 4 scare you away  .
i had an iphone 3g for two years and still highly recommend it , and the iphone 4 is better in every way  .
if you're still not sure , you can sign up for an at t contract and get an iphone 4 , and return it in 30 days if you are unsatisfied (including canceling your contract) .
this phone is well worth the money , and signing your soul to at t for 2 years  .
it is incredibly fast , amazing screen , and solidly built it also shoots hd video in full 720p , and when you export it to your mac it looks incredible you will wonder after having this phone how you survived without it .
buy this phone , you wo not be sorry and is not that what it's all about , buyers regret  .
you will have non if you buy this phone  .
have compared it to other smartphones and iphone 4 is just of superb quality .
all the pro's certainly outweigh any con's  .
apple stays way ahead of any competition by its innovation  .
all the competition seem to do is to try and copy  .
and it's hard to beat all the apps that are available for it .
very sexy phone yes the iphone4 is a bmw but the evo is a porshe  .
ciao ciao ragazzi  .
updated  .
on jul 9 , 2010  .
i've tried out the htc desire too , but although it's just as flashy , the software and design is a little too cumbersome to compare with this iphone 4 a .
i is lucky with mine having no problems that most people have  .
i am in a dead spot at my house and with the iphone 4 i get reception inside while my old 3gs still does not  .
i bought a bumper and i think it makes the phone look even cooler than before so no death grip problems with mine  .
if you like the iphone and want a faster processor , better graphics , longer battery life , then get the new iphone 4  .
if you are not sold on the iphone allow all the negative press persuade you to buy an android phone .
after all the hype and some of the widely reported missteps on the part of at t as well as surprisingly , apple , the 4 is a marked improvement over the 3g and the 3gs which in itself is a revolutionary phone  .
but 1 year and certainly 2 is a long time in the smartphone business as is evident by the new android phones coming out seemingly every fortnight given that apple puts out one phone a year (at least until the verizon iphone comes out) , it can move the bar above the existing phones in some cases and play catch up in other cases  .
two years ago , when the 3g came out , there is rim with the ubiquitous blackberry and the iphone which had the coolness factor despite being on at t  .
now its a very different story with the rapidly evolving android market  .
the iphone does not own coolness by itself anymore  .
however , as of now , it is still the best smartphone in the market that blends in consumer and business tastes for an overall very satisfying experience  .
highly recommended    if you are not in an at t dead zone .
the best smart phone out now  .
this is the best smartphone to date  .
it's sleek , sexy , functional , and it's no cheaper or more expensive than its competition  .
its screen is incredible , the camera quality is beautiful , and the device operates with complete fluidity the only reason to turn this phone down is at t .
a very cool looking phone that can pretty much do anything you need in the palm of your hand .
i recommend this iphone , its the most powerful and fastest one ever .
great phone worth the money  .
the iphone 4 is the best smartphone on the market    bar none  .
the recent furor over signal strength and other issues is nonsense , at least in my case  .
aside from the phone features itself , the 3g seems snappier and surfing the web is much improved  .
the retina display is so crisp that it blows the doors off everything out there  .
the camera (with new led flash) is so much better than the 3gs that i can use it for snapshots and not worry so much about quality (although any phone camera will never rival that of a true digital camera)  .
however , video quality is as good or better than most flash memory    based video cameras , and the $4  .
99 imovie for iphone app is worth every penny subtle improvements    the speakerphone is now usable  .
it actually sounds loud  .
battery life is better    not double but the need to recharge every day or so is not as bad as previous versions  .
love the ios4    multitasking works very well and folders (collections of apps) almost seal the deal by itself have only used facetime by calling the 800 number for apple to test it out , but it works like a charm  .
hopefully this will integrate with macs and pcs as well so both parties do not have to have an iphone 4 overall , a winner  .
is worried about this android juggernaut    seemed like google is becoming a formidable competitor  .
but android is very clunky next to ios4  .
apple proved once again they are second to none , including the copycats at google .
wonderful product  .
silky    smooth web    browsering and all my apps are really fast now  .
i have excellent service where i'm located so i'm not going to bash att  .
and like i said before , the camera really does take awesome pics  .
very very clear  .
compared them with my friends droid incredible which i like alot also but my pics were more vivid and more colorful than his  .
you cannot go wrong with this phone  .
i know alot of android users are really hatin this phone but i'm tellin you , if you get a chance to see it you will be blow away as is i .
i love the phone , hands down the best phone i have ever owned or seen  .
everything works flawlessly  .
i'm just not satisfied with at ts data plans .
i have owned a fair amount of cell phones including the iphone 3g , g1 , blackberry bold , and so on  .
i have also dealt with the new bulky evo and hd2  .
they are great phones but really arent as good as apple's new iphone 4  .
a lot of complaints i see on here are really over the top  .
no phone made to date is perfect but this would be the closest phone to perfection .
amazing technology , at least 5 years ahead of the game  .
bottom    line for me is the iphone hardware and software brings together my digital lifestyle the best  .
i use to carry an mp3 player , a gps for the car , dvd's , my laptop , a camera , but with this device from day one those other devices are now all one  .
i still have my macbook pro 17 , i still by dvd's , i have an slr camara but for everyday use , travel , life with my kids , life at church , life with my friends , the iphone has been priceless  .
i've tested other phones , but their over all experience does not compare .
i would buy more if i had money  .
love the phone  .
dont be fooled by cheap knock of phones like evo  .
save your time and money .
first of all , i just want to say that i haven't had any problems with the signal no matter where i put my hand and neither have any of my 10 coworkers and friends who have it  .
we've been trying , but we cannot get it to do it  .
this review is based on my experience , not what anyone else is saying  .
unlike many reviewers on cnet , i actually own the product and put it through it's paces first of all , i love everything about this phone  .
i had a 3g before so it's a big jump , but it's amazing  .
the speed is great , the reception is better , and i generally love it  .
i'm going to list a few standout features that really made this phone great for me and the things that bother me multitasking  .
the naysayers are bemoaning that it's not real multitasking  .
well i don't know who decided what real multitasking is , but if this is not real then i don't want real  .
the real hangup here is that most of my apps are updated but that will change soon  .
it does everything that real multitasking does without the poor battery life and crappy application management  .
it's a model everyone should follow folders  .
i got this on my 3g but it's one of my favorite things  .
now i don't have to have pages of apps and i can organize everything much better the camera is amazing  .
the iphone always seemed to have a better camera than other phones that touted more megapixels , and that seems to hold true  .
the addition of an led flash is nice , although i seem to be able to product better pictures without the flash so far  .
hd video means i'll never have to carry a video or still camera with me again  .
i don't do high end photography and i realize it won't do for those people , but for a regular point and shoot , it's more than adequate  .
imovie for the iphone is just the icing on the cake speed  .
the new iphone 4 rivals the ipad in speed  .
i don't have to wait for my photos to render anymore and apps launch 4 times as fast by my calculations  .
while waiting for apps to be updated for 4  .
0 it's nice that they launch faster i love the feel of it in my hand and the form factor  .
it looks nice , is thin , and weighs about the same  .
it has a more solid feel than my 3g that definitely makes it feel more high    end  .
one thing i don't like though is i feel like it'd be easier to drop since the glass is slippery  .
it could just be my imagination/fear though facetime  .
it feels more gimmicky than anything else , but it works great  .
i tried it with my friends and the integration is tight  .
i had a poor wifi connection and the picture still looked great and didn't break up or anything  .
it actually didn't seem as awkward as i thought it would be holding the phone out in front of you  .
as more people get iphone 4s and other apps start tapping into the functionality , i can see it really going places  .
it's a really good start screen  .
the screen with the retina display is mind    blowing to say the least  .
text is so much more clear and i didn't think it is bad before  .
now going back i cannot believe how much worse it looked on the old 3g  .
i held it up side by side to a motorola droid and the resolution is shockingly better  .
i hope this starts a wave of better screens in mobile devices on the flip side , i'm going to note a few features that still annoy me and i think other phones do better notifications  .
come on apple  .
one of the most annoying things ever is when something pops up in the middle of you doing something  .
a lot of games just pause when that happens which drives me crazy  .
to make it worse , if i don't want to look at it right then and hit close , it marks it as read and i might forget about it  .
everyone else does notifications better turn by turn directions  .
why don't we have these yet  .
i know there are apps for it , but why cannot we get a basic one built    in for free  .
this is partially on google who has released a great one for android , but put something of this kind in here  .
please  .
i think the base model should have been a 32 gb model  .
i had an 8 gb which i was not using and 16 is plenty for me , but i know i could start filling that up for any number of reasons  .
this is minor , but i think it should have been done  .
with apple's upgrade process , it means we're probably not seeing a 64 gb iphone until next year the app store  .
i think all the bemoaning about the app store restrictions are a lot of whining for the most part  .
however , i think apple's ban on adult and pornographic apps is ridiculous  .
it's not your job to censor us apple  .
make it so we have to put in id or something  .
also be consistent about your approval process  .
you're not the only game in town anymore  .
that said , i do not feel the need to jailbreak as much anymore bottom line , this is an amazing phone and a worthwhile upgrade  .
recommended for anyone who is an iphone fan  .
anyone who is considering getting one and can stomach at t , now is the time .
the phone is simply amazing  .
apple haters need to get a life and recognize a good product when they see it .
when i received this unit thursday night , i knew that i is holding a winner ; it is fast , and the screen is awesome  .
as it is late , i did not get a chance to really put it thru it's paces until friday  .
in the meantime , i synced all of my apps and contacts , and is suprised to find that it did this much faster than my old 3g  .
i have had no issues with reception , or any of the reported problems .
this is the first iphone i've owned  .
i have to say that i've had experience with other very nice phones and this one is by far , my favorite  .
i love the phone    it actually does what it's supposed to do  .
there are some people who want to criticize it because they've chosen sides (for some reason but it's a phone , not a religion) ; however , i could not be happier with any cell phone just because it really is easy to use and i've had no frustrations  .
i've experience some of the competition recently and i can say that this phone may not be for certain peoples , but it is for those who like an elegant , simple approach to high tech , innovative features  .
i recently returned a very high end hd display phone with a huge processor because of frustration and shoddy workmanship  .
the iphone4    phone itself feels like you are holding something that is thought through and designed to last  .
i think that is one of the main things apple got right on this device  .
the phone doesnt have the highest numbers in terms of technical specifications (megapixels , etc etc ) but it takes better pictures than my 10mp camera , and it runs extremely fast)  .
itproves that there is more to building high performance and quality than just giving a device high technical specs  .
to top it off , the app store is awesome    i love that the phone synched up with my personal email and itunes with one click and the touchscreen is intuitive and very responsive  .
two thumbs up  .
an awesome advance in smart phones  .
the phone feels solid and great in my hand  .
the new slim form factor is quite an accomplishment  .
i cannot get over the quality of the screen       icons , photos , documents and videos  .
call quality is excellent ( live in large city in upper midwest) i especially like the new camera       i rely on my smart    phone to for photos more than i care to , but with he 4's new camera i now get photos of excellent quality (good job apple)  .
i am looking forward to the hd video function but wish i had more than 32 gb capacity i am familiar with blackberry (through my employer) and the droid ui (through a client that is testing them)       there is no comparison in overall experience and quality this is the best smart phone on the market , in my opinion , and in most technology experts opinion  .
do your self favor and do not rely exclusively on cnet's anti    apple bias .
best phone ever  .
period  .
updated  .
on jun 27 , 2010  .
i'm not going to sit here and go on about how it's just plain awesome , i'm going to give my own experience based on what i like about the iphone and why i like the new upgrade i is using a 3g , upgraded to ios4  .
it stunk  .
ios4 slowed it down way too much , and even before that it is approaching two years old and just felt slow and sluggish  .
i had heard that the 3gs ran ios4 much better , but that's not what i had so it didn't really matter to me major    .
i text a lot    not so much pics but just a lot of texts  .
the messages app is starting to annoy me just having to wait for the thing to catch up to what i is trying to do  .
what i wanted is a major increase in speed and the ability to multitask  .
the iphone 4 delivers if you've ever used an ipad , the iphone 4 is a lot like that performance    wise  .
it's freakishly fast and the multitasking is just great  .
i use the pandora app all the time while driving and i can finally use maps to figure out where i'm going without stopping the music  .
yay  .
the messages app is dramatically faster , which is great  .
and you can zip back and forth from the messages app to safari to mail to pandora whatever you want and it just flies minor , but nice    .
the screen is just beautiful  .
any description you've heard does not do it justice  .
i don't care about the tech specs , about what critics say , or how steve jobs calls it 'magical'  .
what matters is that , regardless of what you are expecting , it's sharper , brighter , clearer , and more vivid than what you had in mind the battery lasts longer    much longer  .
we all use our phones differently so we'll all get different results , but there is a definite , noticeable improvement here the phone overall feels sturdy and strong  .
as a matter of habit , i try not to let my dog chew on it or throw it across rooms , but it just has a more solid feel to it than previous models    not that they were bad to begin with the camera takes great pics and video  .
but we already knew that the audio is better  .
i know someone who got an ipad and he said the audio output is noticeably better but i couldn't really see how that could be , considering that all of the ipods/iphones/iwhatevers have always had good audio  .
well , the audio output (and even the speaker) sounds a lot better on the iphone 4 too , which is nice since i do use it as a pandora machine and as an ipod  .
a lot lastly , the iphone 4 syncs a lot faster  .
i'm not exactly sure why    probably the faster processor and storage memory , or a lot of little things working together    but backups , syncs , and data transfers of apps/video/music all transfer faster cons  .
i saw the reports of reception issues  .
here's the deal   yes , i can make the bars drop if i smother the phone with my hands  .
but seriously    what phone wouldn't , at least to some degree  .
all i can say is that it hasn't been an issue for me , with about an hour of call time since i got the thing yesterday afternoon without a doubt , the iphone 4 is what the iphone should have been since day one  .
if you like iphone , you'll love the 4  .
if you haven't liked them so far , you probably wo not like this one either .
so far the phone is nothing short of amazing  .
in usual apple fashion , activating , configuring , and restoring from a backup went flawlessly  .
i now have the 32gb nearly full of music , books , audio books , videos , and apps , and with the new iphone 4 have picked up where i left off with my iphone 3gs  .
but what a difference in quality and features  .
and what a difference a year can make in technology  .
oh , and one other thing , but just a footnote because i think it's more hot air than anything of substance   i haven't been able to reproduce this antenna issue that others are claiming to have , so at least i have evidence that it doesn't affect all phones  .
maybe my hands don't sweat enough to conduct electricity , or something , but it certainly is not an issue for me  .
i have not had the phone long enough to say the reception quality is better than the 3gs , but so far it's working just fine for me .
the apple iphone 4 is a huge improvement over my iphone 3g  .
i received it yesterday in the mail and from the beginning it seems much more sturdy and well built  .
activation is really easy , as is converting all of my data from my old iphone over  .
the display , battery , processor , and construction are much improved as is call quality  .
overall , i is extremely happy that i received the phone a day before the actual release at the apple stores and i really like the phone  .
highly recommended  .
simply , for me , the best smartphone i could imagine  .
again , this is perfection .
the second you pick up your new iphone you can just tell is a quality product  .
everything is really fast compared to my 64gb ipod touch and the screen looks soooo much more clear  .
i love having just one device to carry around instead of my bb and my ipod  .
it synced quickly with itunes , which is where i manage my music/podcasts and i love the interface  .
picture quality is great and video quality is good but as with all small camera's , shakiness will alway be an issue  .
this iphone is much louder than my ipod touch , nice for when i'm tooling around the house and do not have it hooked up to the stereo  .
only time will tell if at t makes me hate the decision to move away from verizon but as of now , i'm on iphone owner for life  .
after having been thoroughly impressed by the htc incredible i had my doubts , but this latest incarnation of the iphone does not disappoint .
i is skeptical about getting this phone because it's on att  .
it's my first iphone  .
but when i got it and the service was not that bad , i is happy  .
i got a little emotional once a played around with it because it's just the best thing  .
no phone is better .
this is the best phone ever  .
if you never had an iphone , this is the one to get despite att  .
and if you own an 3g or even 3gs its definitely worth the upgrade  .
folks at cnet have always hated apple so i am not surprised they give it only a warm reception  .
you can tell the bias even in their praise  .
thankfully the world does not care a crap of what cnet thinks .
i love it , love it , love it and you will too  .
no more windows mobile crap jeez .
do not be a hater  .
there is a reason so many people have iphones , because its the best  .
no pixels can be seen , wallpapers are an addition , etc .
what's the point of putting an easily    scratched oleophobic layer of plastic over the impossible    to    scratch gorilla glass  .
4 screen protectors were used until i found one that fit it best also , the stainless steel may be scratch resistant (see apple's new scratch    resistant stainless steel patent) , but it scratches and chips very easily  .
although it did survive drops from 6 feet onto hard wood , etc then there's the rim surrounding the glass , presumably plastic  .
very easily dented final concern is the camera , which is almost level to the back itself  .
i'm worried the lens will get scratched and picture quality will drop well , all about scratches  .
that's all adobe flash is now fixed with the release of flash    to    html5    converting web browser releasing on nov  .
4th  .
i would rather have the feature integrated into safari , but i guess this will have to do battery is pwn  .
lasted ~6 hours on heavy use (counting standby , 19 hours) screen is gorgeous awesome phone  .
beats htc's phones any day , after the grounding problems i've seen on them (half the screen does not work unless you hold the phone , grounding it  .
i like iphone 4 for applications pool  .
a lot of games and applications makes this phone always top rated .
this is my first iphone and i upgraded from the original bb bold  .
i liked my bb and is a big fan of a physical keyboard , but honestly i do not have the opportunity to really miss a physical keyboard as there is just so much i like about this phone  .
i is already well versed with ios as i had a 3rd gen  .
ipod touch and is already starting to use it for more and more of the tasks my bb is taking care of  .
call quality has not been an issue for me , in fact , i have actually had better reception on the iphone 4 than i did on the bold .
love the phone not much of an apple guy but this phone made me think differently towards apples products  .
i really do love apples tech support  .
i have never had a problem they couldn't handle  .
as to the antenna i tried the death grip at one bar and lost service but with a case it fixed the problem  .
why would not you use a case anyways  .
i always use cases to protect my devices  .
as to flash in the phone i'm sure there will be an update for it before the new iphone releases next july  .
at t is a great company for there service in minnesota  .
i know many people dont like this company in the west coast because there service is horrible verizon or sprint is there top company at this time  .
overall its a great phone and its seems to be a high quality product .
no reception problems  .
i love the quick response and beautiful screen .
the apple iphone 4g , 32 gb is a great other than i think that the battery could last longer but according to my teenage son and others i am not taking advantage of all of the features that the phone has to offer  .
although he is very intelligent i am using the features that i need because it is all very new to me .
well i got my iphone 4 (the black one and the 32gb version) like a week ago  .
let me just say that overall , it's spectacular , amazing , and a stellar device  .
you cannot go wrong with purchasing the device first off , the biggest difference of all is really the retina display , some might say the new redesign is but after looking at the display it's really the biggest difference  .
if the iphone 4 used the same display as its previous generation (the iphone 3gs) the only real difference would be design and overall that's not something i would upgrade for  .
it really makes your photos burst to life , text are really sharp , and it can playback 720p videos it looks amazing  .
this is the main feature that makes your old iphone look obsolete , there is no other feature that does that than this anyways , going on with the other parts of the phone , the home button feels a lot more clickier (to me at least) , and the rear camera is great , if not amazing  .
it's one of the best cameras (on a phone) i've used to date , and the interface is nice , simple , and clean  .
it lets you choose where to auto    focus on and pictures are taken super quickly (in like half a second it's taken)  .
it also has led flash which is nice , it helps sometimes but sometimes it might be too bright and there's no options to adjust how bright the flash is but it's alright  .
the front camera is great , for it's class (a 1  .
3 megapixel camera) and best for taking portrait pictures of your self or for facetime calls the speakers are well mediocore but amazing for only one speaker  .
plays a lot louder than my iphone 3gs and iphone 3g  .
still i recommend using headphones or a speaker  .
it also comes with two microphones , one on top near the headphone jack and another on the bottom left next to the dock (it's been switched from right to left from the iphone 3gs)  .
the two microphones have the noise    cancelling feature to give clearer calls and it does work as it should  .
amazing but at t's service is the only problem sometimes i would get dropped calls (i've had one drop call so far) , i transferred from t    mobile and is surprised how spotty their coverage is (especially in orlando , fl) the second best thing about the device is it's new design  .
it's really beautiful and sophisticated  .
the build quality is excellent , it's really hard to think about dropping the device while you're holding it  .
it feels like a luxury device (which it is but just saying you'll have that i cannot believe i'm holding it  .
feeling)  .
the antenna is used as the foundation of both glass panels which happens to be the silver wraparound on the phone (which explains the three lines)  .
another thing is the material they use to build this is almost unscratchable , i have yet to scratch the device after a week's use with no case which i could never do with my iphone 3gs  .
the circular volume buttons also add a luxurious feeling to the device and in my opinion better to use than the volume rocker on the previous generations  .
the ringer switch looks a lot nicer too other features like the apple a4 processor are nice , makes the phone super    snappy , never slowsdown but it's not much faster than my iphone 3gs especially since they're based on the same processor (both cpu and gpu)  .
the only difference is the a4 has better clock cycles and power management plus the 4 sports 512mb of ram which is a nice boost especially for graphics    intensive apps though somewhat overkill like i said , at t has really spotty coverage on almost every state , you cannot go wrong with buying the iphone 4 but you can with getting at t service  .
it will depend on your location but for me (in orlando , fl) i use to be on t    mobile with my iphone 3gs (unlocked and only works through edge) , it worked pretty well especially considering it is on edge  .
with t    mobile i had 4    5 bars everywhere , never had any dead spots except for like 1 little spot i encountered throughout the whole year i is with them  .
i transferred from them to at t to try out the new iphone 4 and at first at t coverage is great , but later on going throughout all of orlando (kisimmee , downtown , avalon park , winter park , altamonte springs , etc) i always had a variety of 0    1 bars to 3    4 bars but i could never keep a complete 5 bar status  .
still despite the bars being low , i could make calls they were very clear , the 3g speeds were extremely fast ranging from 600kbps to 2mbps and it is a big difference from edge (200kbps average) another thing is facetime only works through wifi making it more of a gimmick than a real feature  .
i tried it once and it is nice , works great but like i said i might never use it again ios 4 is great , multi    tasking is done pretty well , not true multi    tasking but otherwise it's just what i need  .
things work really fast and snappy , but folders are kinda weird (only 12 apps  .
) overall the phone is amazing , get a case to get better reception (and either way you should to protect your investment) , and ios is just fluid , fast , and great .
this is my first smart phone coming over from using a razor flip phone  .
i is using a pda for medical programs and now have one device that functions as a phone , pda , and takes hd video or stills to boot  .
i am very happy this this new cool toy , i mean tool .
i've owned all iphones since the 3g  .
each one is much improved over the one it replaces  .
i agree with apple   iphone 4 is the biggest leap yet i'm not the type of person to support a product that doesn't work the way it's supposed to  .
i'll return it without hesitation , and won't try another one the receptions issues are so blown out of proportion , it's disgusting  .
i can kill the signal sometimes , and other times i cannot  .
it really depends where you are  .
if you're smart , like anyone with half a brain , you'll use a case and the problem is non    existent  .
the only dropped calls i've experienced came from the person on the other end  .
my iphone 4 has yet to drop a call  .
the display quality is mind    blowing  .
battery life is fantastic  .
the camera takes very good pictures  .
video quality is great  .
facetime is fun and works very well  .
i cannot live without mobileme sync  .
i'm quite happy using itunes on my mac to sync everything and for updates to the os  .
i select if and when to install updates , and when an os update is available , i don't have to wait for a carrier to push it to my phone  .
once you've dealt with apple's support , you'll quickly realize there is none better , period  .
apple's mac and iphone support has been fantastic , and they're american  .
i can call with confidence that my issues will be handled , and i won't be transferred to 500 different people before i get resolution at t's service in my area has been great , and i'm always treated with respect if i have to call them for anything  .
any issues are always handled promptly  .
much better service in all departments compared to verizon  .
if you're not a data hog , at t offers more attractive data plans my only complaints are minor  .
bluetooth streaming for my car stereo is temperamental  .
it doesn't always connect properly  .
there needs to be more support for controlling the ipod being streamed over bluetooth  .
the only things you can do as of now are play , pause and stop  .
the option to advance tracks from my car stereo is badly needed i had hoped apple would bump up the storage as they've done with all new iphone models , but i can understand why they didn't  .
it's not that they cannot do it , but with all of the physical improvements with iphone 4 , i believe they held back because of costs  .
so , i just saved up a little more for the 32gb model and , lastly , still no white one  .
when it is rumored there is a delay because of production issues , i decided to just get black  .
i can live with it , though it's not really what i wanted  .
hopefully next year there won't be an issue if you're looking for a great phone that can do everything the average person could want , the iphone 4 delivers  .
it's a very solid phone with very solid performance  .
on top of that , it's even beautiful  .
depending on what case you get , you do not have to necessarily hide its beauty  .
the color splash from boxwave is one of those cases  .
solid protection and it's still very visible .
this is a great phone  .
you cannot help but love it every time you touch it and discover all the features  .
not to say it does not have its downs , but the best phone i have owned to date .
without question , the iphone 4 is currently the best cellular phone in the world  .
but be prepared for some dropped    call frustration , more than likely due to at t's inability to support the data and call volume by its users .
in terms of at t , we get no tethering , tiered data etc  .
although on the other hand , with the 200mb plan , i only pay $12 for data with university discount , but i' , not sure if it'll be enough data  .
the only other thing that bothers me , is that being a techie , while using apple products in this ever growing android minority society , i detest being labeled as a fanboy but honestly , this phone is superb  .
i would , and have recommended it to everyone  .
i think cnet should give the editor's choice , and i think consumer reports should recommend it ; no one that i know has this 'signal attenuation' problem (though i'll gladly take my free case)  .
i think the media really has created a problem from very little  .
it's an excepted reality now that all or most phones' signals can destroyed with the death grip , but the iphone 4 suffers this no more than any other  .
maybe i'm still be recovering from two years with an lg vu  shudder  but this phone does every thing i could ever want , for a phone at least  .
also , i do not understand carrying around a 4  .
3 screen  .
i mean , to me even that iphone is a little big  .
but 3  .
5 seems an ideal size  .
it is a phone after all  .
anyway , every problem i have with it seems insignificant , i give it an a .
i have the iphone 4 and its working perfect for me , no attenuation or antenegate however you wanna call it  .
just to let people know that it is not happening to every iphone 4 .
i love this phone  .
it works quite well , and with apple's free case promo , i expect it to work absolutely perfectly  .
i am pleased with my purchase .
there is way too much hype about the antenna problem and apple offered to make it right by giving everyone a free case  .
what person in their right mind would not have a case on this expensive phone  .
i bought the reveal case from griffin and it works great  .
yes i can replicate the lost signal bars with the death grip but i have not dropped a call yet and now i get reception in places i could not get it before  .
great phone overall .
i waited in line for my phone and i have had no problems with the antenna  .
i love my iphone  .
to all of you who gave the iphone a bad rating , stop hating  .
we all know that it is a quality phone at a good price with an amazing os and good service  .
i would recommend it to all .
this phone is a perfect fit for me because i rarely talk on the phone , choosing to primarily text and use social media and email to communicate  .
so far , the iphone has done a great job with that  .
the onscreen keyboard is the best that i've used , and getting facebook notifications and push email has been great to have as well  .
as a mac user , everything is seemlessly integrated and as an avid itunes user all my media is transferred over in a snap  .
exploring the app store is always a fun endeavor , and using facetime i is able to take virtual tours of my friends' new places and see their kids for the first time the antenna issue does not seem to affect my phone , but i would be quite bothered if it happened to me  .
(out of personal style i ended up buying an orange bumper case anyways) facetime would be more useful if it weren't tied down to wifi overall , this is the best multimedia device with phone capabilities for me  .
if i talked on the phone more , and needed a smartphone , i probably would have gotten a droid incredible or evo 4g instead  .
but i do not  .
so the multimedia and apps overwhelmingly tipped the scale .
best os , best screen , best camera , best music player , best apps , best battery life , best looking  .
m not sure it is worth the purchase , but this is certainly a great phone  .
i wouldn  .
t say it is worlds better than the old iphone or other phones on the market , but if you are up for a discounted upgrade you should get it the iphone 4  .
s design is drastically different from its predecessor with a flatter , glossier look  .
both the front and back of the phone are made of glass , while the phone is bordered in stainless steel  .
the phone takes on a much boxier design with this model , which is ok because of its clean  .
apple    esque  .
look  .
plus we are happy that it can now lie flat on a desk without tipping back and forth  .
the phone is available in black and white check out full review at http  //semiprose  .
com/2010/07/04/iphone    4g    review/  .
thanks  .
i knew i needed a new phone after my last phone is shorted out by a torrential rainstorm at an outdoor concert  .
after years of unsuccessfully trying to find a phone that offered just the right balance of coolness and affordability , i decided to ditch that latter entirely when making my new phone decision  .
thank god i did , i'm a better man for it you see , i is one of those people who looked at a phone with a music player , put one or two $7 games on it and said to my friends/family it can do everything an iphone can do , why would i ever need to buy an iphone  .
i am/was such a tool  .
this is lightyears ahead of all the phones i have ever had  .
the iphone 4 has very seriously replaced my nintendo ds , my canon powershot , my pos palm phone , my cd collection , and has almost replaced my laptop  .
pretty cool for one monolithic device the iphone 4 oozes sex appeal from the very first time you take it out of the box till you tuck it in at night  .
i never understood why people needed to have the internet at their fingertips  .
seemed like excess to me  .
, again , i is a naive tool  .
the intuitive browser makes the web a slide of my finger away at all times  .
and to anyone who is worried about the data cap , don  .
2gb a month is more than enough web on the go for almost anyone and it saves you $5 a month too the ipod ensures that i don't have to lug my cd collection with me everywhere i go , though i did need to exchange a 16gb model in for a 32gb one when it turned out i had filled up my phones hard disk space on day 2  .
oops  .
video playback is also very crisp thanks to the godly screen ( which others have covered far better than i) while i also considered the evo 4g , what set the iphone apart for me were two things , apps and battery life  .
a hardcore casual gamer by trade , i is saddened to learn that few serious developers made quality games on the android market  .
i knew if i didn't get an iphone i would always be jealous of the latest mobile gaming craze  .
but now i have like 20 of the little timesuckers on my phone and i couldn't be happier  .
and to keep my productivity at its lowest levels since sleeping in a crib , the battery of the iphone 4 is incredible for the demands i make of it  .
right now i have 11% life remaining after 7 straight hours of heavy gaming , calling , and browsing  .
i have no doubts it would last for days on standby , and 50+ hours of music playback aren't out of the question either  .
after i heard someone complain his evo died after 9 hrs on standby ( no joke) i knew i is making the right choice for me with the iphone i guess i should mention the phone part of the equation as well  .
as a phone , the caller on the other end of the line generally sounds quite clear  .
i also know that i have been in a very very loud bar , received a call , and the person on the other end said i sounded clear and loud , without background noise  .
to the antenna question , yes , my phone suffers from it , as did my 16gb version  .
however , since it is almost always snug in it's case , it has not affected me at all  .
i will say i have had a dropped call or two , but nothing that has cause me great mental anguish the 5mp camera takes lovely photos for a smartphone , colors are bright and accurate , and low light shooting has been noticeably improved as well  .
i find the flash useless since it makes things look like ass , but your mileage may vary  .
the front facing camera should please narcissists to the extreme while the phone is very sexy , i am very concerned for its safety as i am a clumsy person who has yet to sign on for geek squad coverage  .
while cases are not flattering , they are a necessary accessory as even  .
gorilla glass  .
shatters like plain old glass with a phone so feature rich , its hard to remember every single one for assessment  .
i don  .
t really know how well facetime works , since i have yet to try it  .
perhaps when more iphones make it out there i will actually get to use this feature in my final judgement , the iphone 4 is the perfect device for me  .
i save so much pocket room from all the devices i used to carry to get the same functionality , i might actually wear something other than cargos  .
its beautiful to look at , hold , and play  .
i think we  .
re gunna have a lot of fun together  .
i hope you might give the thing a shot too and perhaps you  .
ll be as enthralled as i for a completely different set of reasons  .
ps   here are a few gaming apps everyone should have   doodle jump , angry birds , jet car stunts , n  .
a , tilt to live , and squareball  .
impress your friends  .
anger your boss  .
waste time better spent on picking your nose  .
enjoy  .

on jul 10 , 2010  .
coming from a htc touch pro , where the battery life is so bad (starting the first day i got the phone) , i did not do many things it is capable of such as push technology , calling except in emergencies , internet surfing except in emergencies , basically avoided using it at all during work so i would have some battery life on the way home to quickly check things like the traffic , weather and checking who is better able to pick up kids i is teetering between the iphone 4 and an android phone such as the htc evo or droid incredible , but because of possible short battery life , chose the iphone 4  .
i got it in 7 days after placing my reservation and i am very happy  .
it is not too hard to switch from using window mobile to the ios4  .
i only have a few concerns , listed in the cons , but they are nowhere near the pros  .
one the first day after i got it , i used it at work for a couple of hours and there is still 80% battery life left  .
i am currently trying to drain the battery (apple website recommends draining it once a month to extend battery life) , but i am having a hard time doing it since when i connect it to the computer to add new apps , it charges the phone at that time if apple addresses the issues above , i will upgrade my rating to 5+ stars .
i ditched my evo for this and am not looking back  .
has everything i want/need and then some  .
battery life is incredible  .
will give it a 5/5 if they would fix the notification system  .
havent had any signal issues due to antennae , and phone has much faster speeds than my friend's 3gs  .
in the past i have bought more expensive phones that did a whole lot less  .
i am happy  .
it just works  .
i think they just keep getting better and better  .
holds my life in the darn thing  .
i is sold on the 3g , then the 3gs , and the 4 is definitely worth the upgrade  .
face    time is cool , albeit , i only have one friend with a 4 (that i would use this application with  .
i've tried to focus on hardware in my review but the hardware in concert with ios 4 is a very substantial and welcome upgrade  .
i really like using this phone for gaming , texting , email and web surfing  .
i is initially sent a deffective phone and had to jump through some hoops to have it exchanged (although they were very professional and nice)  .
that coupled with the antenna issue made me resist liking this phione  .
it seemed like a lot of hassle for little improvement  .
after using the phone for a few days , i have come to really love it  .
the camera and display alone make it a worthy upgrade  .
after a rocky start , i am very happy .
this is an excellent smart phone for people who need access to their email and internet during the day or evening when you do not have access to a computer  .
it's really a smaller version of the ipad , it does everything and does it well  .
great over all smart phone .
the iphone 4 kicks booty no matter which some folks want to look at  .
it is definitely worth the 3 bills for the upgrade .
upgraded to the 32gb iphone4 from the 3g  .
same core phone , just many improvements  .
i have had zero issues with the network and no reception issues  .
i do not have any dropped calls (new phone or old phone) and have not experienced any issues covering the antennae on the new one  .
at t works fine where i live and i have no complaints  .
expanded battery life is welcomed  .
i can watch an hour of video on my commute , use the phone all day , and still plenty of battery life at the end of the day  .
screen is absolutely amazing  .
contrast , color rendition , and detail are vastly improved  .
so far , very , very happy and has performed well  .
phone runs much faster than my old 3g to include internet page load .
easily the best smartphone out there right now , really sexy design as well as a gorgeous display  .
cannot go wrong with it  .
also the service problem will be fixed  .
i had great experiences with my 2g and 3g iphone so you can imagine my excitement for this newest iphone iteration  .
though , since many had received their phones early and reported problems with yellowing of the screen and reception problems , i is also a little apprehensive  .
on launch day , i loyally queued up at my local apple store at 6  30am and waited and waited and much much later that day , i finally had my iphone 4 in hand  .
i examined the screen very carefully and there were no flaws , no bad pixels , and the finish is flawless  .
i compared the reception bars from my 3g and 4 and did not see any different in multiple spots in the house  .
bumpers seems to alleviate any problems with antenna issues and look totally rad  .
any case will do the trick who uses their idevice naked anyway  .
so dangerous  .
applications were updated after a restore from backup and i is off and running in a moment with all of my settings , apps , and files  .
the camera is amazing and the hd videos are unbelievable  .
most importantly to me , the phone itself runs smoothly and calls have all be crystal clear and not dropped i know people are raving about the sprint evo but in the los angeles area , there are still many spots where at t's coverage is superior  .
sprints wimax 4g is only available in the north of la (i am in the south) and still not available in tech    heavy san francisco       how on earth  .
i am also a fan of the verizon voice network but in the past have had serious delays in sms and mms messages (i suppose this is because sms/mms is gsm technology) and that's something i cannot deal with since messaging is my primary mode of communication  .
sprint and verizon 3g still do not do data and voice simultaneously fail  .
t    mobile is just an oddball network to me with their weird 3g band choice  .
pricing is pretty much the same no matter what network  .
so , even through at t is not perfect , it may be the lesser of the top 4 evils for me  .
i put a lot of faith in at t to improve their 3g network to near 7  .
2mbps which should give sprint's 4g a run for its money  .
i'm also waiting to see if verizon's 4g lte will roll out before my contract ends       most likely , not ios4 is a very mature , capable , and smooth ui  .
transitions are beautiful and give one the impression of moving around the os instead of just flicking through pages  .
multitasking is promising and pretty solid  .
still not sure if having apps in the multitask tray hurts performance though , i have had all 12 spots used and i'm still at 89% battery at 8pm  .
i still have not been impressed with the google android platform though i guess it could be nice if i had never used iphone oses  .
it should be an indication when the media is so quick to report any news on a device no matter how insignificant as the hype machine surrounding the iphone has done  .
even though some of those complaints are valid a lot of it just goes to show what a game    changer the apple has been in the the mobile phone realm  .
also , don't be so quick to adopt new tech just because of big numbers and stats  .
let the tech mature , refine , and because useful before putting your hard    earned money into it  .
i predict evo owners going through some tough limitations with their new phones (not to mention 5 hrs of battery when 4g is on ouch) in conclusion , the iphone is the best phone on the market in my opinion  .
sure , there are faster , bigger , more megapixel    ey things out there but none do it better than apple  .
this refined and conservative approach brings the user experience to the top of the priority list and when it comes down to it , we do not need all these features so why put up with a bad ui and unreliable performance  .
and why put up with something that's u  .
i mean , you have to look at it every day it's beautiful and it'll change your life .
as far as i am concerned this phone is worth the wait  .
i have been using the iphone since it first came out and i like the design and build quality of this device  .
os 4 is a big improvement over 3  .
3 offering folders and multitasking functions which for me made the phone more functional for my everyday usage face time is also an awesome feature and for folks with family who travel , this will make life easier when you can talk and see the person your talking to at the same time on your phone  .
i know it only works on wiifi , but every hotel has a wifi service so it should not be an issue i understand some folks are having the issue with dropping calls because of the antenna issue , but i bought a incipio case that has a rubber skin with a hard shell and it fixed the problem  .
i would like to see apple address this issue and i think by giving everyone a free rubber case that cost them pennies to build in china would be an easy fix and everyone would forget about it i have been using the device for 4 days now and i would not trade it for anything and i have tried the android and windows phones in the past which claim to do allot , but in the end fall short of what my iphone already does  .
i think the price needs to be a little lower for the average consumer but the sales figures show that if you build something folks want they will buy it , period one of the main issues i have is not the phone itself but how poorly these two companies (apple at t) coordinated the launch of one the most anticipated devices in the past year and they both dropped the ball  .
i is on the apple website for almost 7 hours and finally went to the at t store where i stood in line for an hour and had to leave with a hand written receipt hoping my device is ordered properly because the corporate servers crashed  .
there is no excuse for this  .
these are multi    billion dollar companies who have made allot of money off loyal apple users like me i said my two cents , i hopes it helps in your decision  .
another step in the right direction  .
while it is not perfect it is advancing in good ways with very little missing  .
the big complaint everyone seems to have is loss of reception  .
i have only cause this once and never on accident  .
going from a 3g to this is huge when it comes to speed  .
facetime has great quality and frame rate  .
screen seems more responsive than my 3g  .
i really like the look and feel of the new design , buttons have good feel and fits well in my hand  .
all in all the only things missing are unlimited internet with tethering , text response without going to messages app , and full avrcp bluetooth support .
best iphone , or phone i've owned yet  .
well , well worth the upgrade at $199  .
i'm sure the grip of death will be fixed soon  .
or at least i hope .
i find that ios 4 is much improved performance over os 3 .
this phone is fantastic , this is the first iphone i have owned , but after using  .
some friends' iphone 3g's and 3gs's i can definitely say im glad for waiting for  .
the iphone 4  .
it may not be perfect but then again no cell phone is , this phone  .
has so much to offer with entertainment and usual cell phone usability so  .
i definitely recommend it  .
i am writing this review for those who are considering an upgrade from a previous generation of the iphone  .
if you are eligible go ahead and do it  .
i is fortunate enough to be one of the people who received it on june 23rd  .
after 24 hours i can honestly say that i am incredibly impressed with the build quality  .
it is akin to the difference in the uni    body aluminum macbooks and the polycarbonate bodies of the previous generation  .
i at times have had my 3gs making popping sounds in my hand when tightly gripping it  .
with the 4 you feel as though it is rock solid  .
the seems where materials meet are incredibly tight and there is more weight to it  .
this can be a plus or minus to some but personally the denser a piece of electronics feels the better it is  .
i have not dropped yet so i can  .
t attest to how strong the glass is  .
and frankly i am a little nervous too  .
but , i do not think there will be any problems long term with the integrity of the body  .
that being said it feels  .
weird  .
to hold it  .
this may be due to the fact that my hand is still expecting the rounded shape of the older ones the other upgrades , i have been running os 4 on my 3gs for sometime  .
each build getting more stable  .
it is a big addition , the 2 most important for me being the consolidated email and the addition of folders  .
from a practicality standpoint less finger swipes and wrestling 8 different email accounts makes day to day use far simpler  .
the cameras are fantastic and the hyped transitions between the 2 deliver  .
the flash is a no brainer , i took a few pictures in the dark and they turned out fantastic  .
one note , there seems to be no built in redeye reduction feature  .
this became evident while taking pictures of my dog  .
the screen is gorgeous and on par with my ipad  .
battery life is way up  .
and the new processor cooks  .
everything snaps with a finger swipe  .
even more so than the difference between the 3g and 3gs  .
backgrounding is too be determined as more apps supporting it come to market on to the bad , at t is still terrible  .
reception is in and out , and i am not sure if the transition between 3g , edge and wifi is fully baked yet  .
i suspect an update will follow soon now that these are out in the wild if you are eligible , make the switch  .
my 3gs fetched $305 on ebay and more than paid for my upgrade  .
i think this a testament for the build quality of apple products  .
and the iphone 4 continues the tradition of top notch industrial design .
just a great iphone clearly a step ahaead of all teh otehrs .
the minute you pick up the iphone 4 (i'm going to call it 4) , you know its high quality stuff  .
it's this thin , expensive feeling hardware  .
it's weird to hold it , because you're not used to this such build    quality  .
now , the cameras on the 4 are interesting  .
taking pictures is so quick , and i can press the button 4 times in a row with half a second between , and get 4 (fairly) clear photos  .
video is pretty nice too  .
it rolls a bit (meaning things get skewed if you turn too quickly) , but when just walking , it's fine  .
my only gripe with the new camera is that i cannot change the white balance , add a tint , black and white , etc  .
i just want to edit the photos , without having to get another app to do it the iphone ui is , well it just is  .
nothing particularly spectacular pops out  .
it's super fast , thanks to the a4 , but otherwise it's what i've had for the last 3 years  .
multitasking is nice , but not all apps work yet  .
folders is good , but only 12 apps  .
and hooray for background wallpaper  .
the one thing i really like about apple in general , is they fixed little things , and the fixes shave just a little time off  .
for example , adding a contact is very quick  .
no more switching pages to add a name , going back , switching pages to enter the number , etc  .
it's all on one page , and works  .
i've found that all of the phone it seems the battery is splendid  .
it lasts quite long too  .
although i'm not getting 24 hours , i did get 18 last night , with video playing from youtube , and going to my twitter and e mail client cell reception is improving , trust me  .
i get 2 bars on my 3g , and get 4 on my 4  .
it's improving  .
if they could just ease up on the dropped calls the bottom line   if you want a (very , very) full featured phone , that just works , quickly and beautifully , get a 4  .
if you want a phone that will last at least a day with you doing what you always do , get a 4  .
if you need a phone that has a high megapixel camera , get something else  .
if you want a phone without dropped calls , get a new carrier but i think once you see this for yourself , and play with it , and use it , you will just want it  .
is not that the way it is with all apple products , though  .
still a quality phone , stop bad mouthing apple like android is the most groundbreaking thing ever , battery life , no reception issues thus far and it just being so gosh darn pretty make it just as good as an evo or bbtorch  .
the iphone 4 is yet another phone that sets the bar (or atleast it did when it came out) its rivaled b a only lucky few like the galaxy series , the evo , the incredible , and the g2 , the screen is one of the best out there with no complaints aginst it actually complements the camera and makes the camera seem better than it , it has a front facing camera , the way it's built is extremely sexy  .
(atleast to me) it's famous what else do you want , but at t prevents it from being the best in it's catergory like evry other apple product it  .
updated  .
on oct 23 , 2010  .
i made the switch to iphone4 + at t mainly due to better voice and data plans  .
iphone4 is the incentivizer  .
i tried a couple of other phones but no phone has been able to match the simple design elements of the iphone 4  .
why can  .
t other smartphone makers get smart and copy the rectangular flat shape of the iphone  .
i switched over from verizon , after many years  .
i never had any issues with their coverage , but i had been stuck with a horrible palm treo 700p with a $45 monthly data plan  .
this plan offered online  .
exchange  .
for backing up contacts , calendar , emails , etc  .
, which is why i is stuck to it  .
i dreaded making the change to a new phone and lose all my data well , the switch is pretty painless  .
i thought the at t store staff were sharper and more knowledgeable than many verizon folks i have encountered in the past  .
porting my number is easy and all my palm contacts were transferred over easily as well at the store  .
after that my main concern is backing up my data , contacts , etc  .
for which itunes seemed the only option  .
first i did sync everything with the free itunes download  .
the sync process is very easy  .
however , i later found quite by accident that google offers a microsoft exchange type of free service that can sync contacts , calendar and emails  .
the process of setting up the google exchange is pretty easy , but syncing my iphone contacts with my gmail contacts is little bit nerve wracking due to poor instructions  .
nonetheless , after losing all my iphone contacts , duplicating all contacts and trying various things , i ultimately managed to upload all my iphone contacts into gmail  .
now everything works flawlessly and my iphone instantly syncs my iphone contacts , calendar and gmail account instantly to everything online in my gmail account  .
sweet  .
now i don  .
t even need to sync my iphone with itunes to backup data (although occasionally it will be a good idea  .
) anyone can look up details on google since my wife also has a new iphone , while syncing her phone for the first time in itunes , her contacts were overwritten by my contacts  .
with the initial backup , i managed to restore her contacts back  .
since then i am always careful to do a backup before trying anything in itunes iphone specifics   the phone itself is very slick and is very intuitive to navigate  .
the screen , speed , apps , etc  .
are very user    friendly and easy to install and remove (using itunes)  .
i wish the phone had a dedicated camera button outside  .
the photos and videos look very good  .
very easy to watch youtube videos , online content , etc  .
the wi    fi feature is great since you can use your home or office wireless connection to save on your data usage  .
i chose the 200mb plan so wi    fi seems to work well for me  .
saving phone numbers from callers , attaching to contacts , etc  .
is very easy improvements needed   the phone should have a dedicated button for the camera  .
the keyboard does not have a permanent  .
com  .
button , which is needed so many times  .
also , the shift    lock feature is available in some screens , but not in many other functions such as when typing in notes for a contact  .
i personally have not yet had any issues with dropped calls (charlotte , nc) , but the phone does seem to lose service if held in a firm clasp in some areas of my house  .
it would also be nice to be able to customize alert sounds for emails , alarms , etc  .
setting up a new calendar entry could be simplified for quick entry  .
at present , even when on day view , if you click at 4 pm for instance to set up new appt , it does nothing  .
you have to add a new entry , set the time , etc  .
there should also be a customizable default  .
reminder  .
setting that could be set for all appointments (such as a default 10    min reminder for all appts) bottomline  .
all in all it  .
s a good , positive experience with the iphone  .
as apple continues to improve the phone and allows more customization of features , users will appreciate it more  .
the google exchange sync feature is really very useful so i don  .
t have to worry about losing or damaging my phone  .
it eliminates the need to physically sync the phone to itunes to backup essential data  .
the cheaper data and voice plans also worked better for us , saving us about $40 per month compared to verizon .
why buy this phone  .
i love this product to death  .
i am always on the go and this phone allows me to run my life while i'm on the run  .
this phone is the way i email , watch movies in bed  netflix  , listen to music , listen to music while i play games like sims , listen to lectures , keep track of my calendar , read books , do flashcards , google search , take pictures , face time  .
with all that said , i bought this product because my laptop is an apple computer , the iphone fits into my life easily  .
no worries with syncing  .
my old macbook and iphone fit together seamlessly  .
it does everything i want and more  .
the battery on this puppy lasts as long as i do , and i go for 36 hours straight at the hospital sometimes  .
watching movies on the iphone is a joy , typing emails is a joy  .
would i type an essay on here , no , but 3 paragraphs or less and i'm fine why would you not buy this phone  .
the only reason i can think that i would not get this phone is if i knew the service in my area sucked  .
luckily the service is not too bad here , but i do not think i would get this phone if everyone you know around you with att is complaining of lousy service .
multi    tasking is a pro and a con at the same time  .
the pro is self    explanatory  .
the con is as follows   facebook app for example has to constantly be closed out or updates are hours behind  .
i get current updates as notifications on the phone but when opening the app , the updates aren't there  .
i finally realized that i have to close the app then reopen in order to get the current updates  .
with the ifitness app which tracks your progress each day you exercise , it's the same problem  .
i have to close the app , then reopen on a new day in order for my progress to be tracked on that new day  .
if not , it will track progress as though all the exercises were performed on the original day the app is open if that makes any sense  .
these are my two examples but i'm sure there are more out there facetime is a pro and con as well  .
facetime is good , i think , if i ever get a chance to use it  .
the phone has to be connected to a wi    fi network and can only do facetime with another iphone 4  .
what kind of crazy mess is this  .
wifi should not be a necessity and we should not be limited to just using facetime with another iphone  .
once again , apple's limitations may one day be their doom the antenna issue is real but i think it's overhyped by the media  .
the iphone case program is nice  .
i actually got a very good , quality case i'm disappointed that they didn't make a 64    gig phone and the white phone is unavailable consolidating the multiple mail inboxes are excellent  .
we now have the option to look at a consolidated mail inbox or to still view them seperately  .
the screen is the prettiest , clearest , screen , i've ever seen  .
i cannot believe video and pictures can be so clear on a phone  .
i don't even carry my traditional phone with me anymore now that this phone has a flash  .
i like the thin size of the phone but i could use a bigger screen if that's not a contradiction now let's talk about the most annoying issue ; bluetooth  .
the following issues with bluetooth didn't exist with my 3gs  .
with my new iphone 4 , i have to manually connect (putting in the code) my phone to my truck every time i get in , which is extremely annoying  .
in my car , the phone will connect automatically through bluetooth about 80% of the time  .
sometimes in the car , it will just disconnect  .
my 3gs didn't have any of the problems , so i know it's not the vehicles  .
i'm surprised that apple would make a product without properly vetting it prior to release  .
it reminds me of my old windows    based phone with all else said , i'll still take the iphone over any other phone  .
i've been burned by so many other phones before getting the iphone that i'm still sticking with it  .
i get dropped calls but not too often  .
i got more dropped calls from my old verizon phone (after merging with alltell) than i do with this although if verizon gets the iphone , i'll give then 6 months to work out any kinks , then i'm gone  .
at t is what's holding back the iphone although i am pretty pleased with with reception when travelling abroad  .
at t has a good international plan those of you on the borderline of purchasing the iphone 4 , don't be alarmed at some of the reviews  .
i is on the fence of converting to the iphone 3gs from a windows    based phone but didn't at first because of all the negative reviews online  .
i eventually realized that most of the reviews are from people who don't even own the iphone and who are just reiterating negative reviews that others have posted  .
in all , the iphone , like all phones , has its pros and cons  .
i'll take the iphone , hands down , over any other phone  .
i have a mac and i also have mobileme  .
my phone and computer synch wirelessly and flawlessly with each other and it's a beautiful thing ; a big improvement from my windows phone and old windows laptop  .
back to the iphone , if you're on the verge of getting one , buy one  .
if you do not like it , return within the 30    day period  .
you can even keep your old one during that time to do a comparison    contrast  .
this is what i did when i originally purchased the 3gs  .
my reviews and details are also posted .
i like everything about the phone except the reception which is not good enough , the worst of all the phones i have had , even with the case  .
they need to fix the antena i do not like the fact that i cannot open it to change the battery or take the sims card out if the phone brakes so that i can insert it in another phone .
i'm no fanboy  .
this is the only apple product i own  .
having said that it is a very good phone  .
but let's get to the gripes first reception goes in and out but i don't get many dropped calls  .
while the issue is greatly exaggerated i think apple could have done better  .
also as each person and phone is different so will your experience be on the good side is about everything else  .
screen is great and the right size for me  .
performance upgrade over the 3gs is about the same as is the step up from 3g i wo not get into the android/ ios thing is just stupid bottom line is i can recommend the 4  .
as a side note my free case is the griffin which is a great case .

Camera. UI. Speed. Video Quality. Screen. Apps; More settings for the cameras would be nice. Ability to turn off the shutter (in Japan it may be impossible)

Apple Support, the display, UI, SPEED, battery life, reception, cameras, design, iTunes sync, an OS that isn't fragmented between devices, MobileMe sync, HD video, AT&#38;T; Needs more advanced Bluetooth support, Bluetooth can be glitcy. No 64GB model. No white model yet.
Uh, its just awesome! Look, Feel, Software, Apps, Accessores.; On ATT, but unlock it and you can have it on T-Mobile, not much better but at least it's an option.
Like butter! Fast performance, awe-inspiring display,camera is pretty damn sweet,battery life is much improved, super sexy design; Antenna issue that I don't need to explain. arrogant public responses to antenna issues, glass scratches more easily than one would expect, AT&#38;T's coverage in San Francisco SUCKS
Amazing user interface.. Great battery life.. Super Fast.. Much better speaker phone, wifi is fast.. HD Video is AMAZING, photo quality is awesome.. Face Time is just..... AWESOME!!!; There are no issues with the phone.
Screen is amazing. Facetime is great. Design is superb. Size is perfect blance. OS4 rocks.; Nothing... well, i'm not the biggest fan of ATT. But that's not an issue i have with the Phone.
-Fast Fast Fast. -Build Quality. -User Interface. -Battery Life. -Integrated Email. -Screen Pops. -Camera. -You can sell your 3GS for $100 more than you paid for it.; -AT&#38;T reception still spotty. -Feeling in hand will take some getting used to for people used to the old form factor.
Superlative design, slick interface, sharpest screen, idiot-proof, Wi-Fi access, Gmail Exchange for backups, iTunes sync and lots of useless apps; No dedicated camera button, Signal strength, looks delicate, keyboard settings not thought out well, iTunes sync issues w Multiple phones, online manuals don't do good job of explaining features, one-day battery life, long-winded calendar entries
Fast access to internet, face to face conferencing; AT&#38;T service not the best as a telephone, some dropped calls, although not as much as on my 3GS
The user interface is quite smooth. Has a beautiful and sexy design. App store is the best application market, on quality, quantity and price.; AT&#38;T......
Long battery life, good apps, good reception (using bumper), integrates well with iTunes; IOS4 cannot close all open programs at one time, bumper does not allow a normal headphone jack to attach, hard to upload pictures to computer (windows XP professional), does not directly play to AirTunes (only remotely control iTunes on computer)
The iphone is the only smart phone to buy!; AT&#38;T and price.
Dazzling display, improved primary camera, 4.0 is amazing.; Notifications need to be fixed! Turn by turn directions are just waiting to be there. I would have liked to see a 64 GB model.
overall design, call quality, camera(s), internal storage capacity, the operating system, the endless amount of content and apps available, the overall ease of use, the display, superb battery life, and the overall design.; i havent had any gripes about this phone.
To be honest, I like everything about it, almost. Even the antenna, I have 0 problems with it.; Prone to scratching &#38; denting. Wish there was a 64GB model
Everything is improved on the phone.; I have not experienced any problems, even when trying to replicate the so called antenna problems.
itunes, screen, battery life, and camera; when you hold it without a case but, how manny people a not going to put a case on it
Very fast processor makes this phone a joy to use. Super high resolution screen, improved battery life, beautiful design, improved reception, Face time, enhanced camera, multi tasking, and folders.; Nothing to dislike.
Screen, size, keyboard, app store, camera, video recording, user interface; storage (should have a 64 by now), lacks some of the "openness" of android OS, google maps experience on android is superior
Fast connection on the internet. Intuitive interface. Front facing camera. Awesome display. High definition video.; I hear a lot about reception issues but I personally have no reception problems. But I guess I live in an area with good ATT service.
retina display is awesome! camera is great - specially with camera on both sides and led flash. facetime is great. battery life is awesome. hd video recording is better than my old camcorder. faster processor.; facetime only on wifi; at&#38;t's new limited data plan
Screen Resolution is a huge improvement over 3G/3GS, battery power seems much improved, same power connector for 3G/3Gs/4 and the iPad, applications load really quickly, and the design is sleeker and seems more durable.; No complaints so far.
-comfortable size. -tons of apps and gadgets to enjoy and organize my life. great reception where I live and visit (Lexingon, Ky, Wisconsin, Atlanta). -beautiful pictures and top-notch videos. -easy to use!! Learning curve for 1st time users; Battery can run down if you don't close certain apps and check your settings.. Expensive to purchase and expensive monthly fees depending what services used
Screen. Camera. AT&#38;T. Apps. Support. OS. Price. Compatibility; Everyone goes out of their way to find something that is wrong with the phone. Just admit that it is an amazing phone!
Design, feel, speed; Reception is not the best but I have not experienced higher drop call rates when comparing it to my 3G.
Speed, utility, ease of use, battery life, camera, video and video editing abilities, and the display is amazing.; I'm worried I'll scratch or shatter the glass at some point.
Awesome Display, awesome on battery life, camera takes amazing pictures, new processor never lags, Factime is futuristic, oh and there is about 300,000 applications to choose from..... Better UI than android.; AT&#38;T network
face time, user friendly, light, fits in your pocket, never freezes, the list of pros are to much to fit in this small box.; AT&#38;T not the best service but the Iphone 4 makes it worth while.
Absolutely the best. It has two best features which I think is the most important to Smart Phone. Display and Battery Life.; Nofication need to be fix.
Everything.; Bluetooth devices lose connection and re-connecting via system setting is a bit of awkward. Given all the features, battery life could be better.
Quick downloads, great apps, music, fast, easy to use, the swiss knife of phones.; Phone connections are inferior to the Samsung Blackjack and the Nokia 9300 that I had, even with the case. Very poor connections inside stores.
Huge improvement over 3GS. Retina display is the best there is. Performance is faster - even 3G is peppier. NO signal problems or dropped calls that have been discussed. Photo and video quality are excellent. Overall best smartphone there is.; Nothing of note.
Great reception, best phone I have used (tried others and owned all Iphone models). No problems with OS, or basically just no problems, period.; If people know I have one, I am more likely to be robbed at gunpoint.
The new display is amazing, I can't go back to looking at other phones where everything seems almost blurry.. The phone is blazing fast, loads any application quickly and seamlessly switches between apps.. New camera is really nice.; No adobe flash support.. No widget type programs which would increase productivity.
The Screen, Camera's are improved, The Design, i never liked the rounded back of the formers, and of course the UI, the Battery trumps many out there; AT&#38;T is the only godang thing that is preventing this phone from being like THE BEST!!!!,
Very user friendly.. Takes high quality pictures and video.. Millions of apps for any occasion - including games.. Slick looking cool.. Can watch movies and play music.. Can buy music on the go (no more forgetting to buy at home) Great!; Enslaved to iTunes (though seems to be slowly getting detached i.e. playlists, download purchases, etc.)
-Beautiful new aesthetic form. -The screen looks amazing, no more faded colors. -Excellent photo and video quality. -I like how youre able to customize it now; -Scared of dropping it, i will need to get a new case for it PRONTO. -Call quality ok
The retina display is absolutely stunning. The build quality is great, the rear camera with flash takes excellent photos. Facetime is fun to use. iOS4 adds the necessary multitasking and folders to organize apps.; AT&#38;T. Call quality isn't the best. Antenna issues for some people. AT&#38;T. Apple's PR regarding the situation. AT&#38;T.
Graphics, ease of use, quality, design, size, phone reception, text messaging, camera phone, internet capability etc.; I think that the battery could last longer because I have to recharge it often.
Display is great. Good camera. iMovie app is a plus. Battery is a lot better. Phone design is a winner. Apples bumper is a perfect fit for the phone (material probably made from recycled 3G phones). Better then a swiss army knife; OS needs some tweeking. Needs updated facetime calling. would love to see CC for the disabled working with speaker phone mode
1. retina display easily outclases any other phone display. 2. camera takes awesome photos. 3. face time is cute now, but as it rolls out on laptops it will become more usefull. 4. SEXY design. 5. Really fast with the a4 chip; 1. loss of service problem. 2. no 3G video chat
apps. User interface. hardware. emoji. sound. CAMERA. feeling of superiority over other phones; not much of an upgrade from 3gs but honestly how much better can you make a smartphone anymore? it really does come down to preference since they all basically do the same thing...
the cameras, the folders, the apps, music. I have everything I want in one device.; at&#38;t network isn't as reliable as it should be. They've been around long enough to know how to make a stable network. I wish the map had voice; it's difficult to drive and look at a tiny map.
The HD camera and video upgrades from the 3G. Speed and memory is incredibly fast.; Still drops calls every now and then. AT n T's network still has a lot to be desired and their monopoly needs to be broken up by the FEDs ASAP.
I was thinking about switching my family plan over to Sprint to get some EVOs. But, decided not to since some of my friends (who are Sprint customers) gave them bad reviews and advised against it.; The apple rep advised us while were in in the store purchasing our phones that we should get the bumper for it. He explained why. Apple should find some way to fix this.
OS super easy to use, nice on the eyes and does exactly what it needs to do. Retina screen is amazing, the processor is great and the phone looks great and feels good in the hand.; At&#38;t and no flash.
This phone is FAST. The screen is beautiful. Multitasking! (finally) Camera is awesome (and also faster), camera flash is surprisingly bright. Even the speaker is louder and clearer. Battery life is noticeably longer. Lots of little improvements.; No cons that aren't present on previous models. Stuck to AT&#38;T, no Flash, blah blah blah...
-Absolutely GORGEOUS display. You literally won't believe your eyes. -Snappy Wi-fi and 3G performance here in Texas. -iOS4 is elegant and simple to operate.. -The camera is MUCH improved and shots are fantastic. -The battery is peerless in class. -Apps; -Yes the antenna does that thing. But it hasn't affected me one bit in practice. -I will cry crocodile tears if (when) I break it. -I wish it made me breakfast in the morning
Retina Display, HD Video, LED Flash, A4 Processor, 512 MB of RAM, iOS 4.0, Multitasking, Gyroscope, I'm sure I'm missing some new features, too many to mention.; Antennae hiccups! I have the "grip of death" on my phone. However I don't drop calls, but do lose data speed. However I don't have the problem with a case, which I was planning on using anyway.
Great, easy, but featured OS. Best media player. Of all of them.. Gorgeous screen and UI. Great reception and cell quality (that's what I get anyway). Wonderful tech support ie. Geniuses. iTunes syncing. Fabulous camera(s!). All those apps. All its sensors; AT&#38;T. Widgets would be nice. It seems insignificant, but I'd love to have easier access to turning WiFi, and Bluetooth turnoffable from the home screen
everything about this phone the evo by far the best phone in the market today even my wife and sister ho have the i phone4 agree that my evo is by far batter then their iphone4.; none i hear that the battery is a problem my wife and her sister have the same problem with their iphone4 battery when they use wifi and heavy web browsing.
Lots of features. great camera and flash. HD Video, gorgeous display which is breathtaking. Gyroscope is kind of fun, packed with features.; Glass back could be very prone to damage, not as comfy in the hand as 3GS.
Everything works so great, Apple took what was already awesome and made it amazing!; There will be another year of "iPhone killers" trying to take the title that is years ahead of the competition. Droid is alright for people who want 2nd best in life.
It's faster and the screen is BRILLIANT. My call quality has been excellent, better than my 3GS. Battery life is the same as the 3GS for me. Love the camera...it's beautiful.; Not much. Batter life is still poor, but that is the way of the smartphone world. Slippery. Definitely need a case for grip.
Screen, screen, and screen! Fast, fast, and fast!; Finding a good case is tough. Apple IOS is a bit restrictive when compared to other phones. I really wish I could customize some of the other sounds. No Flash.
Incredibly sleek, extraordinary powerful, apps galore! Love the glass surfaces, front and back; and it's almost impervious to scatches! Worth the wait for super features like face-time and multi-tasking. The clarity is unparallel.; You need a day just to familiarize yourself with all the features and functions. You need another day to evaluate all the possible apps. The biggest con is the price but still I believe it's worth every cent.
Looks great, works amazingly (fast, flawless), iOS 4 is just... Wow. The new antenna definitely improves call quality. This phone is just... the best. No question about it.; One thing: sometimes (not always) when I make a call and hold the antenna, I lose connection. But not enough to drop my call.
Great Display. Apples great customer support. Takes great pictures and videos. Video editing. Yes battery is better. Faster along with great gaming with the new gyroscope built in the phone. This phone is always improving every update apple releases.; Doesn't have Flash. Needs more personalization themes. Antenna problem if your holding it wrong in the worst of service area.
Very fast, love having folders to organize apps, new screen is beautiful, new cameras and video are beautiful too!!! With a bumper, I have no issues with signal, even though I am left handed.; Having to buy a bumper. Bumper interferes with plugging phone into previous generation charger. It came with 2, but we also use them in our car and at computer - must remove bumper to use older chargers.
This is by far the most incredible phone I have ever owned. Here are the main pluses.. -Gorgeous screen. -Fantastic Camera (only 5MP but tests show it beats some 8MP). -Rock solid build, it feels like a well built Apple product. -BLAZINGLY fast!; The only con most people say is AT&#38;T, but I live in Eastern Iowa and have great service!!
facetalk, improved battery life, hd video capability, app store unrivaled, great for epocrates medical program, several convenient gps navigation programs; must use a case due to antennae defect, if you drop it glass will break and cost $150 just in part cost to repair so best use protective case, not good for low light pictures or video but very good it light it adequate for a camera phone
-Cameras. -Display. -Amazing touchscreen. -Ease of Use for so many features. It delivers on what it's supposed to do!. -Facetime is simple and does a great job making video calls very easy. -Fast web compared to the competition I've switched from; -Takes a little getting used to if you haven't used iPhone before. -Once you do, it's addictive. -Once you're in the "Phone application" it's sometimes difficult to navigate to your contacts
Great Screen! Feels great in your hand, best phone I have ever had. Reception has not been an issue at all for me. I've been getting near full bars everywhere I go. Love the camera, its fantastic.; I don't like at&#38;t's 2gb tiered plan for 5 dollars less than the unlimited was. It just seems like such a rip off. At&#38;t needs to implement rollover data.
Very high quality craftmanship and quality. Easy to use and navagate. The reception is the same as my BlackBerry curve 8330. So if reception is bad then so was my BB.I would buy this phone again AT FULL PRICE !!; I had to buy a bumper for the phone for maximum performance. Not really a problem since i WAS GOING TO BUY ONE ANYWAY.
Well designed phone with great functionality and beauty. Extremely easy to use. Everything works like advertised. It made a hugh differance in my productivity. Being a small business owner and the biggest producer of revenue my bank account loves it; Spotty 3G coverage. Come on ATT step up to the plate you have the best smartphone on the market
It's a handheld computer with phone capability - an incredible number of uses in a small handheld form factor.; AT&#38;T. AT&#38;T is every bit as bad as you've heard - very spotty coverage even in suburban Colorado. I knew I would be going to a worse wireless carrier to get the iPhone but I just couldn't wait any longer.
Super display. Ease of changing from 3G to 4. Thinner phone. Folders. Thousands of apps. Easy to sync. Good speaker and clarity. And did I mention the gorgeous display? Easy to see, easy to use. Like multi tasking. Good internet. Great video.; None. Just don't like seeing the bad press on such a great phone. Why would anyone not protect their phone with a case anyway?
Fast, Great Apps, Thin, lightweight.. I just love this phone. It does everything I need it to do and more. I can manage my business with my iphone. As far as the AT&#38;T for years, never had a problem. No drop calls, outages or anything.; I would like to see the ability to use flash
Call reception and clarity is actually better than any phone I've owned before. The screen is beautiful, it runs fast and smoothly, and I haven't really had any real issues.; Does have decreased signal strength when the antennae is touched, but still not that big of an issue.
The design is flawless. It feels like no other smart phone in your hand. The screen is amazingly clear and vivid, better than anything I've seen and I've used my friend's HTC EVO as a comparison. The new OS is great. And so are the cameras.; It's made of glass all around, so I hope I never drop it.
Form Factor, features, software, display, call quality (especially compared to iPhone 3G), speed, Facetime, camera (both rear facing and front facing), iOS4.0 and multitasking.There are a lot of things to like in the new iPhone and some to wish for.; Some of the "software glitches" including the mysterious vanishing bars; glass on the back which while it looks great really shows up dings and falls; fingerprint magnet; lack of Flash or an equivalent which limits access to certain sites.
Retina Display, Better camera, LED Flash, Front-Camera, Spectacular yet sophisticated design, build quality way better than previous generation, very snappy, 3G speeds are really fast and iOS balances everything, and almost unscratchable; Cell reception is really spotty, Facetime (for now) works only through WiFi and somewhat a gimmmick, antenna issues do exist though not a big impact it will affects 3G speeds, and batterry still ends up dying by the end of the day through normal use.
Loud speakerphone. Great Call quality. LOVE IPHONE KEYBOARD. #1 reason i bought iphone 4. Love the Geotagging with the camera. Its cool to view photos based on location and on a map in iPhoto.. LOVE iPod app &#38; Genius Mixes.. VOICEOVER IS BEAST; Honestly, where I live AT&#38;T and Verizon have just as good of service. Although AT&#38;T has better service with just 1 bar!!. -I Hope the release of the Verizon iphone will make AT&#38;T drop its prices and step up its game!!!
Retina display (has to been seen to be believed), awesome camera (no yellow pics for me), better than my 3gs reception (thats right, better than my old 3gs reception!), faster processor (lightening quick) and of course longer battery life.; Only 32 gig hard drive (64 or more would be better), front facing camera is only good when you hold your hand way out away from your face or it looks like an egg, and slow app support for iOs 4 (not apple's fault)
the new screen, a newer better camera, the fit and feel of something solid. I like the simplicity of the OS, it always amazes me how easy it is to operate.; it's not everything for everyone, It still uses AT&#38;T, i'm lucky that I mostly get a good signal.
Beautiful display, the ui remains awesome but much faster; applications zip open an run great, call quality is excellent, feels great in hand--love the new slim, solid form factor; great camera--can leave p&#38;s home--great for low light photos.; Wish it had more memory (64gb); love video chat but wish it was available to more phones (other than i phone 4) and other "chat" programs (I'm sure its coming; Not compatible with my 5ghz "n" wifi signal.
The camera has HDR resolution so the photos come out stunning. All the apps work well together. The signal problem is easily solved by using a case on the phone (you should have one to protect the back and screen from scratches). It's so much fun!; Actually nothing except the fact that it is hard to find an app to make the iPhone4 compatible with Flash based videos, and sites.
Facetime, UI, the sheer amount of apps, quality of apps, camera and video, Itunes store right in your hand, &#38; just overall fun. The ease of syncing Iphone with Itunes for movies, tv shows, and music. Ease of use.; Facetime only on wi-fi, No Flash. I know HTML 5 is up and coming but until it rises to fame and fortune this Apple-Adobe debate is testing my patience.
1. Battery Life has been improved. 2. Muti-Tasking works well. 3. Quicker, stronger reception for calls and wifi. 4. Camara, OMG, Video and Stills are awesome. 5. Folder, I use more apps now because I can get to them faster. 6. Better search. 7. FaceTime; 1. AT&#38;T, service. Even when I had a motorola phone before the iphone, I had poor reception.. I DIDN'T FINISH MY PROS:. 8. The screen is amazing, I love the text and how it appears in apps.. 9. Quicker Syncing. 10. APPs. CON: AT&#38;T
Where could I possibly start? To me this entire phone is a pro.. Phone Design. A4 processor make this phone smooth and fast. The screen has to be seen to believe. Cameras (two) with flash-720p HD video; Beware of the antenna as touching this will lower your signal.. AT&#38;T. However this has not made me drop any calls and is the only cons i can find.
The iPhone 4 does everything it's predecessors did, but does it better. The HD video and camera are great. FaceTime is a great new feature. And as always, the phone is simply smoother and easier to use than any other.; The phone's downfalls are related to reception. Much of it remains a mystery. Is it the phone or just AT&#38;T's horrible service quality?? Regarding the antenna issue, you dont deserve to have a working iPhone if you're not going to put it in a case.
The app store has the biggest collection of free and cheap software.. Very trustworthy reception despite what some have claimed, mine never seems to drop calls even in weak areas! Great interface, and the most responsive touchscreen I've used.; The price is very high, but the phone is so popular that isn't a surprise. Wish it came with a case, cleaning cloth and dock. Wish the white one had been out already. Call quality good but, like its rivals; not as excellent as Nokia cheap phones!
The screen blows the competition out of the water. The multitasking is seamless and the battery life is much improved. The design is slick, modern, and compact. The camera takes great pictures with flash and HD video. The app store has everything!; The reception issues: I have yet to drop a call, even in my elevator. I live in DC which has pretty good reception. The antenna issue exists but with a case it is non-existent (I would use once anyway on any phone I own). Notifications need work.
