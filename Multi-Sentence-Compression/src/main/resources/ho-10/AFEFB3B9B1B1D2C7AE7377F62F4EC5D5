breakfast was a nice hot meals served to order and as we were leaving we saw some of the other rooms which were being cleaned and had obviously been refurbished so some rooms are obviously better than others .
we got there early as we have a brand new car only a few weeks old and did n't want to leave it on the road and there are only around ten spaces .

we had a meal in the restaurant and the young waiter was lovely extremely helpful and we enjoyed our meal very much .
that said the room was quiet with lovely comfy beds so we had a good nights sleep .
