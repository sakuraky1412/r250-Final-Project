everything was handled efficiently by the reception staff , 50+ people were given rooms - ours was on 2nd floor , very clean and had a nice view of the pool area and sea , `` all inclusive '' armbands and information about meals and drinks , and by the time we dropped off our suitcases and went for dinner , restaurant staff was working hard and made sure there was food for all of us .
