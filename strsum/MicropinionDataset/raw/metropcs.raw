$$;
Pros:. Can't beat the price, especially the 10 dollar unlimited international calling plan. I've had nothing but good customer service from Metro PCS. Had nothing but problems with Sprint and AT&#38;T. I will never go back to them.. 
Cons:. Really none. I'm waiting for Metro to expand its coverage area.. 
Summary:. One low price and no add on fees or taxes. I have the most expensive plan. It's the smart phone plan plus unlimited international calls. I pay a total of $60 per month. I was paying almost that much without email or internet. And my land line international calls used to cost me at least $100 per month. Metro has really been a bargain for me. If I were you, I wouldn't really pay too much attention to all those complainers. Try it for yourself. With no contracts, what have you got to lose. Sure beats being locked into a two year contract with a lousy cell phone company - yes, I'm talking about Sprint.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unlimited talk, text and email for one low, all-inclusive price.. Clear, reliable calls.. Metro PCS doesn't drop calls any more than other big name providers.. Easy sale and activation (purchased at E. Sahara &#38; S. Maryland Pkwy store in Las Vegas).. 
Cons:. I've had the service for 2 weeks and I have no complaints whatsoever!. 
Summary:. First, I do not work for MetroPCS and have no reason to write a glorious review. I've read many reviews and see the complaints about MetroPCS. To cut corner$, I am ending my 2-year contract with T-Mobile in August 2010 and I currently have a Blackberry Curve. So far, MetroPCS is a great service for talk, text and basic internet service. And it's all for a great price.. 

$$;
Pros:. I used to be with AT&#38;T, then I went to Sprint and then to Verizon. then I switched to MetroPCS just to give them a chance. I found out that the signal is the same, everything works fine and IM PAYING half of what I was paying with these other guys.. 
Cons:. No 3G, but who needs that if nowadays you are always in front of a computer.. They are stiwching to 4G in winter 2010.. 
Summary:. Sprint: 79.00 + tax = like $90.00. ATT, Verizon, TMobile: aroung $100.00. MetroPCS: $40.00 (taxes included). All these prices are for plans including Text and picture messaging, unlimited minutes (all the US) and web browsing. if you add the GPS, email and other advanced features in other comanies we are talking of at lease 30 dollars added to your bill, with Metro you only pay $5 to $10 more.. 

$$;
Pros:. The cost is excellent, the phone works. It's better than Sprint or At&#38;t. The sales people(although a little slow, but what sales people aren't?) are straight-forward.. 
Cons:. It was a minor pain in the ... to get my number ported, but to save $80 a month it was well worth it. Tech support is in India, but what company doesn't have that non-sense.. 
Summary:. Compared with the tools you find at Sprint, At&#38;t, Verizon, or any of the other schmoes, these guys were excellent. NO LIES OR DECEIT!!! They actually under promised and over delivered. They actually wouldn't sell me a phone because my home is on a mountain where the coverage isn't that great. The fact is, it's BETTER THAN SPRINT OR AT&#38;T were. Of course Sprint and At&#38;t were deceitful with me because those LIARS will do anything to make a buck.. For an $80 phone and a $40 plan I was out the door and working. An to them $40 actually means $40. Of course to the other con artist companies, $59.99 is advertised, but you get a bill for $68.43. Of course when buying the phone, it's advertised as $79.99, but a charger is an extra $40, a memory card is and extra $30. How the F! are you going to use your phone with no charger or memory card?!?!?. This company has an excellent business model. I hope that they thrive, and many other successful companies follow suit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive service, great phone (Code) features, outstanding so far.. 
Cons:. None yet, well maybe...battery life seems a little low on the Code. Will just keep car charger and spare home charger handy. 
Summary:. Had a great experience signing up Saturday, 2/14 in Marietta GA store (Isaac was rep). When discussing my vacation travels to Florida, he actually fessed up that there is spotty coverage for a period of time on the trip (south Georgia), which is the case with Sprint anyway, but once down to S FL, covg will be good. This was BEFORE I signed up, so my first experince with customer service was all good, and Isaac was most pleasant and "non-pressuring," for lack of a better term. I tried to negotiate a better deal w Sprint the day before and they wanted nothing to do with it. Wife and daughter still on Sprint, maybe not for long.. 

$$;
Pros:. Living in Boston I have seen superior coverage to Sprint and TMO in the neighborhoods (Chelsea, Cambridge, Dorchester, Roslindale, Roxbury, Southie). Kudos to MetroPCS for a job well done!. 
Cons:. Cape is not there yet. Only to Bourn and all the way down Route 3. Need P-Town!. 
Summary:. Great value - $50 all in. Nobody comes near - II have the same navigator Verizon uses without all the attitude.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive for unlimited everything. Currently taxes are included in plans so there are no billing surprises or fluctuations with the bill. Free 411. 
Cons:. Most phones offered do not have 3G ability. As a result, internet is very basic unless one purchases one of the more expensive phones that happen to be Samsung. Samsung doesn't work on many free download sites.. 
Summary:. Very few dropped calls as opposed to another network I was with, and no surprise charges. The plans are very economical and they are introducing smart phones to their lineup as well as a 4G network by the end of the year. Sometimes customer service is rude, sometimes they are not. It just depends on the day I guess. lol Better customer service is not worth 30+ dollars a month to me to go with another network, so I will stick with Metro. I have had most issues dealt with no matter what mood the service personnel was in at the time. The taxes Metro charged (before they changed to a tax included service) very cheap in comparison to other service providers.. I first liked Metro because their service plans and phones are no muss, no fuss. I was one of those people that believed a phone is for talking, a computer for computing, and who the heck needs to text when they can talk. Well, since then I have changed my tune, probably because everything is included so why not utilize it. I even dropped more than $100.00 on a smart phone to get the qwerty keyboard. With Verizon, they charged for every text that was sent to me and I could not stop texts from being sent, now I do not have to worry about that.. I like that I can talk, text, surf the web, check email, chat, etc. with no extra fees. About the only thing I do not like is the Samsung phones that will not allow many free download sites to snatch ringtones from the web, though there are 2 websites that I am aware of that are Samsung friendly. The cost of the phones are high depending on what you want, however it is still a savings as opposed to paying an extra $30.00 a month or so to get a cheaper phone from another network. For that reason I do not mind paying full price for a phone from Metro. ($30.00x12=$360.00 I am saving at least a few hundred a year with Metro as opposed to another network even with the purchase of a smart phone). If one travels too far from a major city, one cannot get service. I do not travel so I don't need to worry about that. If I decide to visit relatives that are out of zone I can always get a minute phone that will work where I go.. I love the free 411 feature. One can get directions or call a place of business directly, and that has been a lifesaver on a few occasions. Not a feature I would pay extra for because I simply do not need to use it often enough, but it is very nice to be included in the plan just in case it is needed on the spot.. I most definitely recommend this product to most people, unless they travel a lot out of the coverage area.. 

$$;
Pros:. I pay 50 dollar for my samsung code with windows mobile love it, i stay in the coverage area so its perfect for me. well i put money on my metro connect when i'm out of area.. 
Cons:. They need more smartphone to take the major out of bussiness.. needs more nice phones.. 
Summary:. if you got money to pay $120 for all the thing that i have for $ 50 God bless you I don't.. 

$$;
Pros:. Four lines with unlimited nationwide, text, internet, voicemail for 100.00 per month. I was paying that for the same with 1 line with sprint. Voicemail is the best of any carrier I have had, none showing up hours later like with sprint.. 
Cons:. Large cost for purchase of phones. Phones tend to be more basic and few options available, must hunt through all features of all phones to get what you want. Phone customer service is poor, but there are many dealers who can help at their locations.. 
Summary:. If you do not travel beyond your home area this is the best deal around. Solid service from Orlando to the coast. Pricing that is absurdly low, and no commitment. This is everything the other companies should offer. Call quality is as good as Sprints and better than previous carrier T-Mobile. Phone cost will soon be recouped with the low monthly cost.. 

$$;
Pros:. unlimited service everything. no contract no credit check. 
Cons:. limited to major cities. 
Summary:. unlimited service. minutes text. pic text sms mms. web loc and long. 

$$;
Pros:. The unlimited Everything. My family uses it for every day work they say that they love it they don't have any dropped calls but there are some areas that don't get very good service. 
Cons:. Friends say that there are some areas that don't get good service. 
Summary:. I like it when i use their phones it is just fine the txt messages always get send and everything. 

$$;
Pros:. I have had my cell phone service with Metro PCS for over a year now and have had ZERO issues. I love that I know how much my service cost each month with NO surprise.. 
Cons:. I have no cons. 
Summary:. I only wish I had changed over to Metro PCS sooner so I could have saved a lot more money. I pay $55 per month after all the tax's and I get unlimited talk, IM, picture messages and surf the web. Metro PCS now has unlimited Nation wide coverage!. 

$$;
Pros:. Many plan options, good local coverage,. 
Cons:. Choices of Phones are limited. 
Summary:. I'm a former Cingular and Sprint customer before I switched to Metro (customer for 7 years). For what I pay monthly ($50) I have internet, 411, unlimited local and long distance, unlimited text and good coverage in my area. Here is how to improve your experience with metro, buy Nokia or Motorola phones.. 

$$;
Pros:. cheap! unlimited nationwide minutes plan! great metro connect account where you can store money to make international long distance calls (at v competitive rates, at least in my experience).. 
Cons:. a bit frustrating to have to pay to use the service when i roam outside my service area, but now that they made travel talk part of the plan, it's at least possible to make roaming calls. 
Summary:. I love this company. I was at first frustrated that i couldn't get any live customer service representatives, but if you go through the process of automated system, you do get a live operator at the end, so i'm happy now concerning that. I would not want to give up this phone service ever. And having ended up screwing up other companies by going "over the minute limit" this company is so perfect for me! Great crystal clear phone reception here too.. 

$$;
Pros:. PRICE...PRICE...Few dropped calls..PRICE Free 411. 
Cons:. Have to live in a Metro area.. areas have expanded.. 
Summary:. Having had contracts with all the major co's for years I am happy to report I have three Metros (1 Razr-2 nokias) The bill for all three saves me hundreds of dollars a month. My Plan has unlimited directory assistance too. Once I recieved bills from ATT/ Cingular of a thousand dollars and Sprint for $800 I threw away all the expensive treos and others. I know if I lived in the middle of nowhere, this would not be the right co for me. I live in Florida and get perfect reception. I vacationed to CA and got perfect reception in Sanfrancisco, San Jose and Monterrey too. I save so much money with metro!For all these reasons I give it a ten!. 

$$;
Pros:. Metro pcs is top of the line quality for sure, you cannot beat the quality in cell phone service.. 
Cons:. The cons are rather insignificant.. 
Summary:. True to the team best possible explanation for metro pcs is the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. I left AT &#38;T due to lousy customer service. I decided to give Metro a try., I get everything and customer service is great so far. I have had no dropped calls but I do know this was a problem a while ago in the Florida area. Not here in Dallas.. 
Cons:. I have no cons at this point.. 
Summary:. You can choose the package that suits you. I get everything I need for one price with no limits on texting, emails, long distance, unlimited minutes. I get inernet, chat messaging, news, GPS, and not charged extra. So, I think it is a no brainer. I know others who pay such high fees for contract phones and that is not alll they pay. They pay extra for all the fun stuff. So, I am completley happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great price. Unlimited calls and text. No dropped calls. No unexpected charges (e.g. have to explicitly consent to roam). I have reception at work in a room where generally cells don't have one. Awesome rebates for new phones.. 
Cons:. Customer service annoying - but not as annoying as other people find it. It is as annoying as ATT's, Sprint's or Bank of America's. Unfortunately, I don't know a single company that doesn't make you go through the automated menu.. 
Summary:. So far, 4.5 stars. I signed up online - very easy process. My phone (which was $150 before rebates, and $70 after rebates) arrived in the mail within 2 business days. Activation was very easy - a brief phone call to customer service. Customer service in general is reasonably easy to reach, and they are quite helpful (I made three calls to them so far).. I am paying $40 (sic!) for unlimited local and long-distance calls and texting - this is INCLUDING taxes and miscellaneous charges. $40!!! Their national network is quite extensive, but if I do go outside the network, I am warned that I am entering a roaming area, and then I have an option of paying something like 20 cents a minute.. For those of you who want a smartphone, their selection of those is small, and they don't have iPhone or Nexus.. So far, I love it. If anything goes wrong, I will be sure to post updates. I have no idea why people dislike them so much! :) I highly recommend them!. Updated. on Mar 26, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. $750 cheaper per year than my old plan with AT&#38;T, Unlimited texting, talk, unlimited HTML web browsing &#38; unlimited international calling = Huge value for the money.. 
Cons:. For the price I pay and the value of the services I receive from Metro, I can't complain. But if you do a lot of traveling or don't live in one of Metros major coverage areas, than Metro is probably not for you.. 
Summary:. I bought the Samsung Code from MetroPCS after having an Iphone for 2 years and I couldn't be more satisfied with the deal I'm getting. One of the major issues I had with the Iphone was not being able to multitask. For example, I like to listen to Pandora internet radio WHILE I do other things such as writing emails or going through my calender, and I am able to do that with my Code for much less money. Plus with unlimited web I am able to watch videos on youtube, go on tweeter, facebook and myspace. For what I demand, Metro &#38; the Code are perfect for me.. **To the previous poster "kbharris2", First of all, you didn't even review the product and you gave it 1 star, how does that make sense? Second, It sounds to me like you are a disgruntled former employee trying to "rig" this review board with negative reviews. Your theory might make sense if there were a lot of positive reviews, but for the most part, the reviews are negative which leads me to believe you might be trying to cover up what you have done. Either way, your post sheds some light on explaining why the user reviews for Metro on cnet.com are "unusually low" when compared to all the other online review sites. On all the other review sites Metro always scores at least the same or higher than Cricket &#38; Boost mobile.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap plans and keep getting cheaper.. No phone subsidy, so no hidden cancellation fee.. Able to keep your phone from a previous service.. 
Cons:. Limited smartphone selection.. Limited range if you travel outside your local area, otherwise fine.. Phone insurance isn't worth the cost.. 
Summary:. I've used Sprint, AT&#38;T (formerly Cingular), and now Metro. All have their issues somewhere. I rarely travel, so having an inexpensive plan for my business was key. I've saved hundreds of dollars from my old plans on the other carriers. Even with AT&#38;T's new $60 play, I'm still saving money. Customer service is the same with Metro as it is with others. Sprint's was decent, but AT&#38;T's was awful. Metro is way better than AT&#38;T and close to on par with Sprint.. No company is perfect, but if you don't travel outside your local area, Metro is hard to beat. If you do travel, the Metro will be frustrating. You get what you pay for. Do your homework and get what's best for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. NO CELL DROPS(USES VERIZON TOWERS) OVERALL IF YOU TEND TO STAY IN YOUR STATE METROPCS IS A GREAT CHOICE. 
Cons:. LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE. BUT YOU REALLY DONT NEED TO EVER CALL THEM.AS EVERYTHING IS HANDLED ONLINE AND SINCE ITS UNLIMITED YOU WILL NEVER HAVE "BILLING ISSUES". 
Summary:. I remember when metropcs first came out and I heard about how horrible they were.. I stayed away from them.. at the time I had verizon wireless. I used to work at Circuit City and I remember a verizon wireless rep telling me how metro is actually using there toweres... I figured I would give it a try.. it has been 2 years and lots of $$$ saved and I must say the service is excellant(cell service) The cost of buying a metro phone is identical to purchasing one from verizon( don't beleive the media go and look yourself)... and no contract.. On top of this you can actually bring your old phone from your carrier and metro will program it for you.. I don't think it gets any better then that.. No contract no phone to buy, great cell service(never had dropped calls) And less then half of what the other major carriers are charging... If you do not travel out of state often and want good service but don't want to pay $130 a month for a single line... Then don't think twice!! I pay 160(including tax for 5 lines unlimited!! with voicemail, caller id unlimited txt messaging! tell me if verizon or sprint can beat that!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Service. 
Cons:. Update site. 
Summary:. Well this site needs to be updates why cause metro pcs has PTT now and has Family Plans now but other than that its Good but not the best. 

$$;
Pros:. Unlimited incoming, outgoing, and texting. 
Cons:. Type of phones offered. 
Summary:. For folks living in the MetroPCS market area it's a wonderful service. For their children it's a must have service. Why? Unlimited talking and texting for less than $50 monthly. On other vendors plans I've seen family's bills run over $1,000 so I tell them about MetroPCS, they're quite surprised with that knowledge. Everyone with children that have cell phones I've mention MetroPCS to made the switch to MetroPCS saving money and family aggravation. Service is excellent in their covered areas; mine is Atlanta metro area.. Also now you may use your MetroPCS phone in the other MetroPCS areas at no extra cost.. Because of the unlimited incoming/outgoing minutes Most of my business associates use MetroPCS. One less headache not having to worry about minutes talked.. 

$$;
Pros:. Low price, reliablility, simplicity, unlimited voice/text/pics/internet. 
Cons:. lacking 'flashy' phone selection, and not a single smart phone option.. 
Summary:. I love this service, it only sucks when I wish I had a cooler phone then my razr. They just got a phone with a qwerty pad recently though. I almost thought about going with Verizon for unlimited $99/mo, but paying double what I pay now isn't worth $600 (12mo x $50 more) a year.. 

$$;
Pros:. Free Long Distance; Free SMS; CHEAP Web. 
Cons:. CDMA; Roaming Fees; No Windows Mobile Phones. 
Summary:. IMHO, MetroPCS is the best cellular provider I have had, to date. I have previously used Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Cingular.. The great thing about MetroPCS is there is no contract, and no per-minute fees. You pay a flat rate each month, and get unlimited talk time and unlimited long distance.. Adding SMS and image email is $5. Adding web browsing is another $5 (yeap, and no per minute/hour fee, either).. The only reason I won't give a 10 is that MetroPCS doesn't support any smart phones. There is a hack for one of the windows mobile phones, though. The phones MetroPCS offers are good quality and comparable to other carriers.. 

$$;
Pros:. Affordable, great coverage, competetive with other carriers with upgraded phones,they are always offering rebates to new customers and when you buy a new phone so the phones aren't always full price, coverage in all major cities regardless of state. 
Cons:. Coverage is not great when you go out to the BOONIES. Customer service is hard to get ahold of.. 
Summary:. Metro PCS is an excellent cell carrier for anyone looking to stay within their budget. I travelled from FL to NJ and had coverage almost the whole way. I also travelled from FL to Nebraska and even though they aren't supposed to have coverage past Georgia I had great reception in all the major cities. But lets face it, if you have money to travel all over the US, then you have the money and can afford to pay the $100+ a month it cost to have one of the major carriers. I got tired of paying 120$ a month for verizon and I didn't have unlimited minutes with that plan. My phone has everything and more that my verizon phone had, well all except for the tv thing...but who really watches tv on their cell phone? :/ I pay a flat rate of 55$ a month (that includes taxes) and I have unlimited everything, contact back up, insurance on my phone and all the extras, caller id, call waiting..... Updated. on Oct 10, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Built-in traffic and GPS programs are a very useful bonus. Call quality is great. Haven't had a dropped call in three months of service. Customer service has been fine. No "gotchas.". 
Cons:. Limited service areas (metros only). Daytona/Orlando/Tampa areas are fine.. 
Summary:. Great service for the price. No worrying about running over my minutes and no added fees. For unlimited plans, Wal-Mart and Verizon have plans with wider coverage areas to consider if you travel a lot, but their software does not have the built in nav and traffic systems. I have recommended to others and they have been very happy with the service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Service is GREAT!. Good coverage. 
Cons:. customer support needs some help.. 
Summary:. Metro Pcs is a good phone company for people that don't want contracts. For $40 a month you'll get unlimited nation wide calling, txting, web, and data. Its a pretty good deal.. The only bad thing is the customer service. The coperate stores dont even answer there phone. 

$$;
Pros:. I am lucky enough to live in a big city(NYC). They did a great job of building out there equipment in all 5 boroughs. I switched from Sprint and do not have any regrets. I do love the cost as well.$40 for unlimited text talk and web its a no brainer.. 
Cons:. Coverage out of NYC is spotty. The call number on the website is automated and its impossible to get to a rep. 611 does solve this but its kinda of a pain if your calling from a landline. 
Summary:. Good deal for the money if you live in a big city where coverage is not a problem I would recommend Metro PCS. I love the service. 

$$;
Pros:. The Samsung code which I bought is fun, I love it. Easy to use once you get the hang of it. there are so many different applications, things to do and I am still learning.. 
Cons:. Battery life not so good, but if you use less of the web etc it lasts whole day.. The storage is small, additional storage or memory.. why build a dataphone with such small storage, to make money, you will need to buy more storage.... 
Summary:. If I was to listen or make a decision not to get Metro PCS from all the bad stuff written here, I would not have bought this phone or try the service. Always go to a metro PCS store, not dealership or whatever.. the Customer Service Rep...was excellent..He was at the number 4 or 3register I think CSRA8079...hispanic I think too...however, he was the best...warm, friendly and although he was tired...he gave excellent service to everyone. I went in there and watched everyone and he was the best. Took the time out to listen to your concerns, answers questions truthfully. I have excellent reception. I live in NY and pretty much the reception is as good as Tmobile or even better. While I was in the line to get my new service I realized that a lot of people don't understand your advertisement it needs to be more simplier or less ambigious. Just say what the true prize of the phone is, not telling people oh You save such and such while they have to pay upfront the hugh cost. That is where I see the problem people might have or is having.. Overall I have no complaints still getting use to my phone.. Updated. on Mar 11, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Store employees helpful and knowledgeable, equipment apparently good - and "Metro PCS promise" right on the money; I got all my money back when I had to return the phone. 
Cons:. No coverage in my area; I apparently live in a "coverage hole" (not the first time this has been a problem). 
Summary:. If coverage becomes available, I will be back in a minute!. 

$$;
Pros:. Unlimited everything. no contract to worry about. 
Cons:. customer service is retarded, but where isnt it?. 
Summary:. Ive been reading some of the other reviews here, and im honestly surprised with all the folks who say they have lots of dropped calls etc. I have had maybe one or two calls ever dropped and it couldve been the other persons phone too, I am i nthe Orlando area, my husband has the same plan as i do, my parents have metro as well. We have been pleased with everything from the beginning..I love not ever worrying about minutes-overages etc, i just talk, text and internet as much as i want and our bill is always the same. My husband uses his phone for work and its been very reliable, he went to detroit and we went to georgia and had no reception problems at all the whole way. It works all over florida. People always assume its got sketchy service but that is not the case for us at all. We are not huge technophobes so we dont really mind just a basic phone with good service, that is what you get. I have to disagree with those that say you have to pay extra for text etc.,- you choose the price plan you want, and you can see from the beginning which features you get with that plan, just like a contract phone. The customer service isnt really all that bad, I called a few weeks ago to check on something and they were very polite and more than helpful with my problem. Ive never had a big problem and that may be why some people are talking badly about the company, but all the people i know who have it, dont have any issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. NEVER dropped a call, customer service was WAY better than ATT, all the features work (Blackberry), and when I had a problem with the phone (hardware-related), I got a NEW BB for 3 bucks!!!. 
Cons:. Nothing yet.. 
Summary:. I wanted an ADULT smartphone (Blackberry), but WILL NOT sign up for some 2-3 year contract. Been there, done that...took the phone home and had NO SERVICE without walking out in the front yard and sticking my thumb in my butt to get a signal. I tried Boost Mobile (because of the coverage area-Sprint network) but their phones suck. When I saw MetroPCS was offering a Blackberry on their "unlimited" plan, I was curious. Although the initial cost was a whopper ($400 bucks to buy the Blackberry), I figured I'd take a chance. I bought it, activated it, and was AMAZED at the service. Everything works. Unlimited phone, e-mail (push, no less!), FAST web access, texting, GPS, Enterprise server, everything that makes the Blackberry a Blackberry, and all for $60 bucks a month. I have been all over Florida, Georgia and Tennessee, and have always had service. In my home area (East Central FL), I very seldom drop below 5 bars, and have 3G service. ALL the BB stuff works...I can go to Crackberry.com and download ringtones, themes, apps and all the stuff available for the BB Curve.. About 7 months after getting the BB, it got "sick" (corrupted files) which resulted in the BB randomly re-booting. I took it to the local MetroPCS dealer to see if they could re-load the OS, and they said they'd simply give me a NEW BB for 3 BUCKS! Apparently Metro/BB warrants the phone for 1 year, no questions asked. I got my NEW BB, but the store tech monkey'd something up when transferring my account/data to the new phone. Although the phone worked, the browser/e-mail suff didn't, and I didn't notice it untill I got home. Instead of going back to the store, I though I'd try to use their reportedly crappy/non-existent phone support. I called, and immediately got a tech (American) on the line. When I explained that I had a Blackberry, she switched me to their BB Tech Center in Seattle. I spent about an hour on the phone with the MetroPCS BB tech-guy, who walked me completely through the programming of the phone, and even turned on some extra "features" that most BB users don't have. The guy was GREAT.....I thought I was talking to Bill Gates. No scripted questions/answers, he KNEW what he was doing, and a really nice guy. He repeatedly apologized for the store tech and the trouble I was having. He even CALLED me back the next day to make sure my BB was 100%, which it was.. Bottom line.......I can't speak to other phones and service offered by MetroPCS, but when it comes to the Blackberry, you get EXCELLENT service and 100% of the features, with excellent coverage, all for $60 bucks a month.....and no contract. To me, it doesn't get better than that. I don't know why anybody that wants/needs a top-tier smartphone that's aimed at ADULTS would waste their money on the "big" carriers, when Metro does it all for so much less. Sure, the phone is expensive, but if you can't afford a one-time expense of $300-$400, then you shouldn't be shopping for smartphones anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Unlimited everything!. 2. Lowest monthly bill Ive had. 3. Good call quality IF you have strong reception where you are. 4. Free international txt. 5. Unlimited International calling to lots of places for $5. 
Cons:. 1. No globalphones (with CDMA and GSM technology built in). 2. The phone that I ordered didn't come with a USB cable. 3. International calling card only available in the corporate stores. 4. Post a list of countries covered by the $5 international plan?. 
Summary:. I have had MetroPCS for just over two months now and so far I am very happy with them. I live in a service area that has a solid 4 bars of connection and good 3G data connection; I have never had a dropped call and the call clarity is as good as ATT and far better than Sprint.. Ive tried all the major service providers and none were significantly better, most were worse; Verizon overcharged me 18 out of 24 months and I would spend literally 1-2 hours on the phone each month fixing it (once they charged me $500 of international use when I had not been out of the country for 2 months!). Sprint had horrible reception and more dropped calls than anyone, T-mobile did not have 3g at the time I had service with them, though their customer service was outstanding. ATT, my provider before switching to Metro, had great call quality, acceptable data quality, and i could use it internationally but the bill was way too much for the service.. I ordered my Metro phone over the internet and it arrived one day earlier than promised, with a tracking number emailed to me within a few hours of placing the order.. I have called MetroPCS customer service 3 times so far including the new activation, and each time the rep answered my question politely and efficiently; I never had to wait more than 2 minutes, which is something I can not say for any other carrier except t-mobile.. Things I like about the service:. 1. Unlimited everything!. 2. Lowest monthly bill Ive had in 5 years+, and fixed bill too. 3. Good call quality IF you have strong reception where you are. 4. Free international txt; I use this a lot and it works great. 5. Unlimited International calling to lots of places with a $5 fee / month. 6. International calling to places not covered in the plan is cheap when using their ILD card. (Cheaper than ATT and Verizon, on par with T-mobile). Things I don't like about the service:. 1. No international phones (phones with both CDMA and GSM technology built in.. please add one; yes I know you can flash a blackberry 8830 to Metro but still...). 2. The phone that I ordered didn't come with a USB cable; but it did use a standard connector so I could use one I already had and the software drivers were easily available.. 3. International calling card seems to be only available in the corporate stores; how about letting us add money online without having to even get a card??. 4. I wish they would post a list of the countries that are covered by the $5 international plan? you can check a specific phone number, which is ok, but come on, how hard is it to just post a country list??. Bottom line:. For me, Metro has been a great option; but do your research. Check the coverage map for the areas you will be using the phone. Research the fone you want to buy. DONT buy from an authorized dealer. I picked Metro because of the value they offered, not because of credit or any other issue and so far, I'm glad I did.. (disclaimer: I am not employed by MetroPCS or any of its affiliates or dealers, but I am a computer engineer with a strong understanding of cell technology). 

$$;
Pros:. Unlimited For a low Price Without alot of BS. 
Cons:. The Choice of Phones and The fact that u can;t access your account online. 
Summary:. I love metro PCS I live In Detroit,Mi and before this service came along everyone was used to the house phone because lets face it we don't need contracts holding us down and as far as the face that traveling is somewhat restricted, think about it how many times do u go out of town if your average John or Mary? You go to work or school then you stay close to home u may travel a little. Overall its good service unlike paying 100 plus dollars a month for service with contracts. When i feel i don't want a cell phone service anymore with metro PCS i just don't pay my bill no damage to my credit look at that if i want to pay late sure why not no credit checks! So no damage one again get the picture? Bottom line its easy to sign up all the minutes you want yeah its not perfect but you pay for what you get in America baby you don't like it go pay Sprint or Verizon a million dollars a year. 

$$;
Pros:. All you can eat for 55 USD. What can I say? Calls to China using the unlimited International Plan worked. Mobile Web speed is OK, like dialup. Good enough for light usage, full HTML webpages on my phone may be slowing the download.. 
Cons:. Quite a few dropped calls while driving around Los Angeles. The hand off software between cell sites needs to be improved. Basically, either you have good coverage and signal or you have none.. 
Summary:. After owning the Samsung Finesse Phone and MetroPCS service for a week. I love the phone, but the service is spotty. Really like the phone and now I can see why some people love the Apple iPhone. On this phone, I can get full HTML pages which is nice, but probably faster to use the moblie (mobi) webpages for many sites. As far as MetroPCS service, some areas are very good, some areas it is nowhere to be found. Calls to China using the unlimited International Plan worked. Customer Service (which was suppose to be a big negative) was decent. Not great, but good. Big problem with customer service has nothing to do with the reps, but all about the MetroPCS equipment and service coverage. Tried to activate my phone from the mobile phone. Don't do it unless you are in a very strong coverage area. Call their toll free number and do it that way. 888-863-8768. NOTHING WORST THAN GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING WITH THEM ONLY TO BE DISCO AT THE LAST MINUTE BECAUSE OF LACK OF SIGNAL.. 

$$;
Pros:. THEY HAVE GREAT PLANS..... 
Cons:. THE SERVICE.... 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Price. Blackberry Curve.. 
Cons:. So far i am pleasantly surprised.. 
Summary:. I have been with ATT for years and very happy with their service, phones and reception. But the recession has me looking over my expenses. Wow, I am spending $190/MO for 1 phone line. $99 unlimited talk, $50 Blackberry service and lots and lots of taxes. I couln't believe when I found a company called Metro PCS that offered Blackberry service and unlimited talk for $50/MO. I'm in Orlando, so the coverage here is actually as good as Sprint or TMobile. ATT remains the king - for a price. After reading so many awful things about Metro PCS I was so scared, but at that price I had to try. I have traveled from the Florida East to West coast and have had great cell reception in all covered markets. I have the BB Curve with email, voice, text, data &#38; internet. All works great. I told ATT I would stay if they gave me a $50 discount but they scoffed. So I left. No regrets. BTW Metro customer service was also comparable to ATT. Just fine. If your in a covered market, make the switch &#38; don't be afraid.. 

$$;
Pros:. No contract, no surprise charges, tallk, or text all day, and now a family plan for up to 4 phones, for $100. Husband traveled to Texas, and was still going strong. No additional charges to pay...What a deal. 
Cons:. Phone selection is limited. 
Summary:. If you are a someone who calls or texts alot throughout the day on a daily basis, then this is the plan for you. No nonsense, no frills type of cell phone user, this is the plan for you. Although companies like Verizon, Sprint and AT&#38;T do offer a better variety of phones as far as selection for free, or reduced price, in the long run you pay triple or quadruple that for service in a year. At metro.. I pay $200 for a samsung messenger, and have a bill of 85.00 a month..that is for 2 phones, unlimited text and calls. At Sprint..Yes I got a free phone but my bill ranged from anywhere from $60.00 (a good month) to $120 a month....RIDICULOUS! $960 a year sounds much better the $1440 plus...... I am never surprised when I receive my bill or left in shock for days on end. Customer service could use some assistance, phone selection could use some upgrading, but overall I am satisfied.. 

$$;
Pros:. No brainer service, no hidden charges. 
Cons:. Service areas limited, charges to make payment, staff education and politeness under par. 
Summary:. All in all, I am happy with my Metro service. Flat fees and no hidden charges, no going over my minutes and free long distance. Yaayy!! Politeness and education of staff is a problem. Hate the fact that I have to go into the store to make a payment and they charge me a fee for paying it.. 

$$;
Pros:. fixed price, no contract, text free, unlimited.. 
Cons:. They need some smartphones with big screen for option.. 
Summary:. If phone bill is a priority, pcs is the answer, where you can surf the net, textmsg unlimited both mms and sms, receiving email offline and call all day to anywhere in USA for $50? I enjoy very highly. The bad part is there is no smartphone, forget all fanzy phones like Q 9, I-760, blackjack II or treos, or curve, so you have to put up with SLVR L7c, or samsung U520 (their top of line phones entire co.) squinting eyeballs when reading emails or surfing net. Other than that they are cool, given more time I think they might be big, but they need some gutsy phones to offer.. 

$$;
Pros:. For $103 per month, my husband and I have unlimited cell phone service. 
Cons:. Limited phone selections, customer service sucks. 
Summary:. Both my husband and I have had MetroPCS since its inception here in south Florida. In the first place service was very spotty at best as there weren't enough towers. Now I find the the service to be comparable to the Verizon Wireless that I dumped to go to MetroPCS.. Biggest advantage? For a total of $103 per month, including taxes, for both of us... I have unlimited text, photo, and voice time, hubby has unlimited voice service (he has no use for text messages). We both have 3 way calling and voice mail and we are both on the phone constantly. My last Verizon bill (back before I became a travelling salesman and really started using my phone) was $320.00 for a month for just me. Hubby's was only in the $180's. So MetroPCS is a no brainer for us.. However... the downside is that because it is a prepay service, most of their cliental are people who really can't afford cell phones and are basically the irresponsible lower eschelons of society. As a result, if you have a problem with something and need to contact customer service, you are going to be treated like gum on someone's shoe. The average customer service employee at MetroPCS is like a waitress at an all you can eat buffet... all gum chewing attitude who thinks she is better than her job with more teeth left than brain cells. I much prefer customer service from Verizon... its like walking into Nordstrom and asking for assistance... a very pleasant experience.. However, all in all, at 20% of the price, I can put up with bad attitude customer (lack of) service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great value.. 
Cons:. Reception not the best in some areas.. 

$$;
Pros:. same bill, unlimited mintues. 
Cons:. phone features disabled (no mp3s), no AIM IM. 
Summary:. I had them in Florida for three years now. Customer service is good. Its not automatic! I never had a problem with billing issues or going over mintues. Its good to see they finally got some good phones like the razar with more. on the way. you cant use mp3s on your phone cause metropcs wants you to buy it on @metro from your phone. As for the call reception is good in the Orlando Florida area. My friends be having sprint and the call be droping and metropcs has good coverage there. I do find the roaming expenisive. I hear the carrier going to expand in a big way! Going into the northeast, boston, ny soon. I will tell my friends about metropcs and the great price.. 

$$;
Pros:. I really like that there are no contracts, it truly is what it says it is. I love the navigation, the internet, face book, all that stuff for way cheaper than my friends are paying for the other companies.. 
Cons:. the customer service over the phone is terrible but if you go into a store they usually are nice. I have had metro for almost 5 yrs now and have minimal problems.. 
Summary:. it's really a good deal!. 

$$;
Pros:. A total package for one price, no hidden fees! ..taxes and such included. You can upgrade to different service plans or add on packages. UNLIMITED really means unlimited any time day or night, or day of week!. Generally good value for your buck.. 
Cons:. Third party (franchise) stores that sell the phones.. No iphone service.. 
Summary:. This service offers unlimited for one low price. No hidden fees or costs (I believe they changed their fee structure in the past year).. If you need anything other than buying a phone DO NOT go to third party stores for anything else! They provide terrible service and give out misinformation! You will just need to go to a corporate store to fix the mess. Go to the corporate store the first time to deal with anything that needs to be handled.. I do personally wish they offered a different plan for their family packages instead of just offering $5 off per plan per month. Perhaps they will in the future offer something better than that.. Do not expect free phones from this company. Other companies roll the "free" phone cost into their contract cost. No contract, no free phone here. However, you can find some great deals on phone prices online at their website. If you want to deal with it, you can also find phones listed at ebay. Just make sure you know what your doing and that the phone is truly a Metro PCS one before you bid.. This service does not drop anymore for me than my kids T-Mobile phone service does (their dad provides this service, but pay MUCH MORE for limited minutes and hours/days of the week)...but they drop calls in different places from each other.. Overall it is a good service for the price paid if you are in a city that has established coverage. Newer cities may have hiccups until the coverage area is more established and settled.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good reception. Simple billing. No contract. 
Cons:. My experience signing up for service at the MetroPCS store in Hazel Park MI was awful. Network is not quite as seamless as Verizon. 
Summary:. A few months ago, my Verizon contract was up and I decided MetroPCS was worth trying. Verizon was $40 a month plus tax for a plan that included 400 minutes of voice and absolutely nothing else. MetroPCS was $40 INCLUDING tax for unlimited voice, text, data, picture messaging and a bunch of other stuff (which, by the way, would cost $100 a month from Verizon). And there was no contract, so I figured if I didn't like it I could just go back to Verizon.. So far, I've been very happy, I'm surprised at all the negative reviews on this site. I haven't exactly traveled extensively thus far, but my phone has worked everywhere I've needed it to, all over MIchigan and in Chicago. And even if I have to go out of network, I can use the Verizon network for 19 cents a minute. In three months, I think I've used about 50 cents in out-of-network minutes so it hasn't been a big expense. Your phone always tells you if you're out of network, so there are no surprises.. The network so far has been very good, I would say it's very slightly less reliable than Verizon, which is still quite good. One small trade-off is that it's not quite as seamless as a larger network like Verizon. Occasionally, you may have to switch the system setting on your phone if you're traveling. But it's really not a big deal.. I've also found that I actually prefer prepaid billing to monthly contracts. With Verizon, I had to keep track of my usage and go through a bill every month. Now, I can call or text whoever, whenever and set my MetroPCS account to Autopay and forget it. It's always taken out on the same day of the month and it's always $40.. I also haven't experienced the problems with customer service that others have mentioned. When you call customer service, you have to follow a series of voice prompts. When you get an agent, they may not speak English that well, and they may not be that bright, but they generally solve your problem. I wish it was better, but it's no worse than any other wireless provider.. One note- the data service can be very slow, at least with the $40 plan. This doesn't really bother me, as I was paying more on my old plan and got no data at all. I can check my email and get driving directions and do some other things, and for me, that's good enough. If data is a big priority for you, you should probably upgrade to the $50 smartphone plan.. 

$$;
Pros:. Really can't beat the price for getting unlimited everything! Their coverage is expanding and I believe it will continue to expand. 
Cons:. Over the phone customer service/support is nearly impossible, all it is, is recordings, you never speak to a person, I always had to go into one of thier stores if I needed to talk to someone; additional fees for any form of payments. 
Summary:. I started with Verizon and really didn't like thier customer service, then switched to Metro PCS and didn't really have any serious problems-had a minor issue when i first made the switch but they fixed it without a problem very promptly- had to go into the store tho.... ended up switching to T-Mobile to get a more fancy internet/phone and it was the biggest mistake ever! I had a HORRIBLE time with T-Mobile and would NEVER EVER go back to them!!!! I regret ever leaving Metro and plan on rejoining soon. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to navigate and not too difficult. 
Cons:. finger navigation is awkward and would love a better speaker phone. 
Summary:. good basic phone for an unlimited carrier.. 

$$;
Pros:. i think that the unlimted service is the best out there compared to other prepaid plans, dropped calls can happen on any network. contract or prepaid. 
Cons:. I think their phones are alittle high/ not enough selection. 
Summary:. I love my Samsung finesse smartphone it cost me $200.00 to buy. But compared to a contract phone i would be paying $80,00 a month for service plus an extra $30.00 for a mandatory data plan with metro i only pay $50.00 a month plus the $4 for the insurance and I get the same perks with them that I would get with a contract phone only I'm saving $55.00 a month. I love everything about this phone! Metro is ok in my book!. 

$$;
Pros:. I've spent from hundreds to thousands in cellular services and can tell you service(s) drop all the time from all of them. None are perfect. Customer Service should stay in U.S.A. for our consumers.. 
Cons:. Tough to easily call in to local stores.. 
Summary:. Payment system flawless to date. No over charges or big auditing issues with a flat fee service. Smart Phone services plans for $50 monthly... the BIG GUYS can eat my shorts, since they also took jobs from Americans to offer through their global unions.. Sad, their is little loyalty and patriotism in this country.. 

$$;
Pros:. I've had the service for 2 yrs and have only experienced 2 outages both after severe storms. Excellent Low cost family plans, especially iif you have a teenager, with unlimited local/long distance and text. Great reception/service DFW Metroplex area.. 
Cons:. Cust. Serv Reps go by script when you get to a certain point with the 1st rep they transfer you to another &#38; you have to start all over from the start going just beyond where you were transfered if not resolved transfered again &#38; U start all over!. 
Summary:. I love the service hate the robotic customer service reps!. I have had MetroPCS for 2 years. The Service/Reception in the DFW Metroplex area is really very good. I can travel aprox 80 miles outside of the metroplex area before I start loosing the service. Love the unlimited texting, local and long distance plans. The family plans you do not share minutes which is the greatest especially if you have a fast fingered teen that is also very chatty!. Phones- Use caution and research the phones they offer before you buy one since the phones cost a bit more to compensate for the low cost plans. I am about to get my 3rd phone! 1st phone was without a doubt my fault dropped in the lake never to be seen again!(oops) 2nd phone I thought I had damaged but now I am thinking it may have been the Kyocera phone. I got a Kyocera Strobe 612 and really regreted spending the money on it 2 weeks later. The phone just powers off for no reason, frequently try to get into the phone book/contacts list on the phone and get a message "updating phone book" What The HECK! Why would the network need to update something that is saved on my phone? To reset the error sometimes if power down take out battery wait 5 minutes put it back together and turn it back on the phone book MIGHT be working. The front key pad started acting up after about 3 or 4 months. Short battery life replaced 2 times already and need another but decided Im getting a new phone instead. It will be my christmas present this year.. Cust Serv call centers located world wide so you can never get the same cust svc rep twice. They use a script for problem solving and you have to start all over from start with each transfer to another rep. 1 time paid account but the phones got turned off when I called I was told I had shorted the payment by 15 cents they would not take my card over the phone because it was under the minumum amount allowed. We had to drive in almost 10 miles to a store to pay .15 cents and had to pay a 3.00 handling charge for paying an actual person. 24 hrs later phones still off called back to cust serv and got a HUGE RUN AROUND and each Rep/MANAGER said something different from the last. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!. bottom line-------. research the phone reviews before you buy, hope you never have to call customer service and especially dont short pay by even a penny. Overall If you do not do a lot of traveling out of the major city you are in its a great service. The minutes for roaming however even the pre purchased are Expensive. The reception/service in metroplex and in my case surrounding AREA IS EXCELLENT. The plans available from very low cost 25.00 minimum plans all the way up to a very reasonable $75.00 unlimited everything with all the bells and whistles plan. The Family plans are equally as good.. 

$$;
Pros:. I get a low price and UNLIMITED MINUTES. It works fine in the places where I spend almost all of my time. I don't need a rural nationwide network. I tend to travel mostly to just big cities. And MetroPCS works in all big metro areas.. 
Cons:. I don't like that MetroPCS is currently offering a $30 per month plan which would satisfy my needs. But I can't get the $30 plan, because I am not a new activation. Hence, I have to keep paying $40 per month. But I still love the UNLIMITED MINUTES. 
Summary:. MetroPCS works fine in the places where I spend almost all of my time. And I love the UNLIMITED MINUTES.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great service plan if ay of the three major companies gave you unlimited every thing for anywhere close to this I would jumped on with them.. 
Cons:. Horrible customer service. They are not really trained to do nothing. Everytime Ive ever called about problems with my phone. They just tell me to restart it and thats it. Small choice of phones.. 
Summary:. Great plan idea. The other major companies could take a note or two on it. But if you dont live where service is all around...... you might as well yell and hope whoever you trying to talk to can hear or you will be walking around for along time trying to get signal.. 

$$;
Pros:. one flat rait unlimited everything. 
Cons:. not that great of reception. 
Summary:. there is a family plan and my phone works well but my boyfriends phone sucks i dont know if its the fact that he bought a cheaper one than me or what but his phone never gets reception. 

$$;
Pros:. MetroPCS offers excellent coverage and call quality through California. The network does not appear overcrowded and I experience dropped calls very rarely, usually due to relay issues while driving. The price is unrivaled. Good international rates.. 
Cons:. The data network is older and quite slow. Tethering options for mobile laptop connectivity are not offered. Macintosh iSync compatible phones are rare, and the network is not GSM so your ability to bring your own phone is severely limited.. 
Summary:. MetroPCS does not offer much but they excel in what they do offer. If you are looking for an unlimited prepaid service which is priced substantially below the price of a contract plan, you may wish to consider this unique product.. I use a Motorola RAZR V3s in conjunction with Metro?s service in the San Francisco Bay Area for roughly six months. I have found the call quality to be clear and consistent throughout the area and much of the state, far better than any other provider I have ever used. Only rarely is a call dropped, and it is usually when I am either driving or entering a subway station where the call must be forwarded to a smaller antenna on the platform, which doesn?t seem to connect with the surface antenna system.. The text messaging service is very reliable and is able to send international SMS at a reasonably competent level. International texting (unlimited, of course) is included with the $45 per month plan and I have tested it with most British carriers. It usually works quickly and reliable but some O2 customers are unable to send replies to MetroPCS.. This talk of international usage brings me to another point, international rates. The international calling rates on MetroPCS are among the best in the industry but they made substantial changes to the way in which international calls are dialed. A few months ago the network was configured such that you prepaid international long distance credit and simply dialed the numbers right out of your address book, as if you were calling via international direct dial. The only difference is that Metro charges ONLY 2 CENTS per minute to call England, a steal compared to all other mobile carriers in the US. This feature ended though, much to my dismay. The rate is still the same very competitive rate but it requires the user to dial a calling card number, and then enter the phone number, which is inconvenient. Many of my international contact also reported that their phones were unable to identify my number when routed through the new system. If I could change one thing about the service, I would bring back the MetroConnect international calling system.. The last bit about international functionality is that of international roaming, there isn?t any. Enough said, that?s why I didn?t give 4 stars. Even if there was, the CDMA network issue would offer only limited functionality in a few countries.. Given that the network is CDMA, the user must rely on MertoPCS for all phone choices. They can flash phones to operate on the network but the options are not nearly as extensive as if the network was GSM. If this were so, any smartphone would be compatible but instead, there are no options beyond very basic phones which Metro supports, there it is rumored some smartphones can be hacked to work on Metro.. The negative things being mentioned, I will now accentuate what I love about this service. They don?t sell you more than you need and then force you to keep buying it for two years. When you subscribe to a major provider, you pay for very extensive coverage that you probably won?t use. Instead of using this model, Metro has included coverage only in major metropolitan areas of the country (as the name implies though roaming is available via Verizon) and you pay half as much as the unlimited rates of the competition. For all of this unlimited service, there is no contract and phone prices are reasonable. Though the plans have only basic services (no laptop tethering or 3G speeds,) the services they offer are very reliable and the call quality is amazing for a mobile provider. I live within two blocks of a tower (hard not to do in the city) and the quality is as good as a landline. Likewise, the voice features such as the voicemail system and conference calling system are quite solid and of course... unlimited.. The customer service is very good relative to other carriers I have used. When you need tech support, you are usually on hold for a maximum of 5 minutes, if at all. It is refreshing to get an agent after two rings instead of two hours!. Overall, MetroPCS offers the consumer an excellent service with no strings attached. You pay for unlimited calling, texting, and MetroWeb. This is exactly what you will get, it is delivered competently, consistently, and at an excellent value. Just don?t expect to see an iPhone or Blackberry on Metro anytime soon.... Updated. on Mar 14, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Great plan, unlimited minutes to anywhere in the U.S.. 
Cons:. Only good in its service area, otherwise you have to pay for special plans to roam around the country.. 

$$;
Pros:. OK, ive been with metro PCS for a few years now. Ive been threw maybe 3-5 phones, and have had to recieve customer service... Pro's; Great price for the phone service, no contracts, true UNLIMITED.. 
Cons:. Cons... Customer service is REALLY bad... good luck getting a human being to speak with on the phone, and when you go to a service center, be ready to wait for a while. and lastly, no smart phones.... 
Summary:. Overall, if you dont travel very much(which most people really dont) its the best plan you can get for the money. Besides the expensive phones(due to the no contracts) the phone service isnt as bad as it used to be in the begining, meaning you get as many dropped calls as you do on any other provider. If you do travel, you can put some money on "travel talk" which is like 25cents a minute or something, which is pretty dicey but it works. If you live in the Metro PCS area, this is a great "beginer" phone, being that you wont rack up like $300 in overages, and they do have some resonably priced phones.. 

$$;
Pros:. No contract. 
Cons:. poor customer service. 
Summary:. Why buy a contract that limits you to so many minutes then get nailed for exceeding your minutes. Then if you are inclined to give up the service they screw you with early termination fees. Teenagers are always on the phone. Metro PCS is unlimited talk time without a contract. This makes up for their lousy customer service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great phones with many service features for one price(txt, email, internet, navigation, etc.) Price is much lower for alot of features compared to companies such as AT&#38;T, Sprint and Verizon.. 
Cons:. High priced phones, poor customer service, frequent dropped calls, if there's a problem with your phone noone is experienced in getting it fully resolved, I realize my expectations are too high when I need help with service or phone. 
Summary:. The phone purchased was a Samsung Caliber. the plan was for $40.00 which is a good price. The cost is good in comparison to companies such as Sprint, Verizon and AT&#38;T. Not sure why they won't deilver plans that may be a little higher but offer all the same features(txt, internet and email). The phone other than dropping calls is a beautiful phone that works without problems.. The downside to the service and representative of the company, is how customers are treated once they require assistance with a phone. The phone was purchased at an authorized dealer, not a corporate store, 1805 Mott Avenue, Far Rockaway New York 11691. It is suggested that you stay away from this location. The employees and the "sort of managers" give misinformation and appear clueless in many areas. Upon purchasing a phone I was informed of a store special that entitled me to a rebate over 150 dollars. The phone was more than 350 dollars. The phones are expensive by the way so keep that in mind when determining whether you'll become a customer and "try it out". After about ten return visits to finally speak with a manager, the manager told me the employee who sold me the phone no longer worked there. He called the employee a known liar. He could not stand behind the lie I was told. I was told by the manager I could receive a rebate that was about 80 percent less. I refused based on the grounds of ethics and standing behind a contract agreement that was on my receipt. PLEASE IN ALL CASES GET EVERYTHING WRITTEN DOWN. I am moving on to the next step.. Other than my situation I love the phone and the price. It's a shame that in order to cut overhead costs, customer service is inadequate and not helpful. Good luck if you purchase a phone and pay for a specific no-contract plan. There are advantages and disadvantages. One may outweigh the other depending on your needs at that specific moment. AT&#38;T, Sprint and Verizon please start offering comparable packages. We deserve value and quality. MetroPcs please renovate your internal workings and upgrade the network.. 

$$;
Pros:. The low cost of the plan. Unlimited everything is spectacular.. 
Cons:. 1. The service. 2. How slow the internet is (still glad to have it though).. 
Summary:. Overall, I love it but it could way better.. 

$$;
Pros:. - price doesnt fluctuate. - truly unlimited. - simple handsets. 
Cons:. - not a national carrier. 
Summary:. DISCLAIMER: I worked for a metroPCS dealer in the Philadelphia market. If you are a frequent traveler the service isnt for you, but if it works in your area and you want a simple service for a reasonable price this is for you. The unlimited talk and text plan costs $40 a month. After taxes you'll pay $50 or so. This is comparable to the entry level services from Verizon, Sprint, Tmobile or AT&#38;T. Sure, with metroPCS you are sacrificing coverage area however you're usage isnt metered.. No one from the big 4 companies will let you try their product for a "free" month. You pay for the cost of the phone, but that can be a nominal fee as cheap as $20.. metroPCS even has a policy that allows its customers try a phone for an hour without penalty. You are allowed to use the phone for 59 minutes. If the service doesnt work or there is an issue with the phone you can return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.. I've had customers replace their home phone line with this carrier. Sure, that may not work for you, but it is possible. Again i must say "if it works it works". As far as the phone hardware is concerned, metroPCS focuses on no frills phones so they can keep the customer's overall cost down. The phones are cheap, but they're enough to use talk and text features. In my opinion Samsung brand models are the most reliable phones sold at metroPCS stores.. You dont sign a contract with metroPCS, so the company doesnt subsidize your phone. You must pay retail value. The bad news? The phones can be pricey. The good news though, is that you dont pay any cancellation fees to cover the cost from the other companies subsidizing your phone. metroPCS always has some sort of sale happening to lower the cost of their phones.. Sure, you may never see an Apple iPhone or a RIM Blackberry in their lineup but that saves you money. Would you really pay $600 for a phone up front? I wouldnt. metroPCS supports the basic functions of a phone network; Talk, text and primitive web browsing. You dont need an iPhone to enjoy that.. The bottom line.....its cheap, its simple and it may work for you. Give it a chance to shine..

Pros:. I live in Manhattan and my phones seem to have work in most areas where even T-Mobile or ATT wouldn't work. 
Cons:. Customer Service ??? there isn't any I have to trick the system just so I can talk to a real person horrible.. 
Summary:. 40 BUCKS, unlimited everything including the slowest limited web.. 

$$;
Pros:. Metro Navigator, it really is unlimited everything for a single never changing low price. 
Cons:. The WORST Customer service you will ever experience. They know it and they couldn't care less if you don't like it.. 
Summary:. Metro PCS is great if you're not that picky about what kind of phone you use and really need to watch your money. It's only $40 to $55 a month. The voice and text service in their major cities is as good or better than AT&#38;T or Verizon. I've had them all. I'll still take Metro PCS.. The Metro Navigator GPS feature is surprisingly useful for something you don't have to pay extra for, Excellent turn by turn turn directions. Goodbye Mapquest. The Internet? It's so slow don't even bother but hang in there. That's about the change in a big way if you can wait till the end of the year.. There's only one or two phones you might call smart.. The rest is just low end crap from five years ago.. Whatever you do,.DO NOT SET FOOT IN A METRO PCS COMPANY STORE!! You'll want to hurt somebody. Mother Teresa would cuss them out. INSANELY HORRIBLE!!! Better to go to Best Buy or even some strip mall independent dealer. .. 

$$;
Pros:. The plan are cheap and you get lots of it.. Pretty good phone. Metro is starting to expand.. 
Cons:. the services suck the phones are to expensive. to many drop calls.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unlimited talking, service is affordable compared to other carriers, the company is in expansion. 
Cons:. The service is very limited t specific areas. The service is spotty (lots of drop calls), Internet browsing is very slow, and very unpractical. Their cellphones are very basic and expensive plus don't have lots of applications. 
Summary:. I love the unlimited talking, service is affordable compared to other carriers, the company is in expansion.The service is very limited t specific areas. The service is spotty (lots of drop calls), Internet browsing is very slow, and very unpractical., Internet and data both going/coming are slow. Their cellphones are very basic and expensive plus don't have lots of applications. 

$$;
Pros:. Interesting unlimited calling plans, good service in the area covered. 
Cons:. Service limited to few states. Terrible customer service (almost impossible to talk with an agent, not even an e-mail address for customer service!). Limited choice of phones, no smart phone.. 
Summary:. As long as you don't travel outside the services states, MetroPCS provides a good service at a competitive price.. The customer service is not bad, it is simply inexistent. It's almost impossible to talk with an agent and the system is clearly designed to discourage the customers to call (useless automated voice mail, dropping calls etc.). Bottom line: good as long as everything works, good luck if you have any problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Metropcs is cheap phone service and everything is unlimited. The phones are nice.. 
Cons:. The coverage of Metro is terrible. The phones are expensive. The text messages sometimes take hours to get to the person and yes I mean hours.. 
Summary:. Bottom-line Metropcs is a cheap service with a small coverage area and the phones are expensive the texting can takes hours instead of the 30 some seconds I think it should. The only thing i like about Metropcs is that it is cheap and the phones are nice.. 

$$;
Pros:. MetroPCS have been pricing aggressively (like some of the other prepaid carriers) and I decided to try them out simply based on price. I normally use Straight Talk, which I found to be very good.. 
Cons:. Low network quality and NO network outside city. I knew, before buying a MetroPCS phone, that they had much smaller coverage than most of the other carriers but I wasn't expecting it to be THAT bad.. Customer service is terrible!. 
Summary:. Sadly, I can not see myself using this product even for one month. I would also not recommend it to anyone else.. It seems I'll just hang on to my favorite prepaid plan: Straight Talk. At $30 for 1000minutes/1000texts and 30mb data it is still the best deal, especially when considering it's backed up by the great Verizon network.. 

$$;
Pros:. The flat rate plan concept for unlimited is use is great.. 
Cons:. Limited unreliable coverage. Dropped calls, delayed sms, certain websites are blocked, terrible customer service, slow web access and poor call quality. Blackberry is crippled.. 
Summary:. Bottom line is this. I personally cannot affort to try and save 10 to 15 dollars for poor unreliable coverage. Its very risky to use MetroPcs for any important phone calls like a job interview or communicating for business or dealing with the IRS because you will get disconnected. The internet is very slow and there are several blocked websites. You cannot stream music. If you want to travel on business or simply take a trip you more than likely will only have text messaging capabilities. The call quality is very poor cutting in and out and if the other person has any issues themselves you can forget about having a conversation. I personally recieved 1 text message a day late and several were just never recieved. MetroPcs advertises unlimited web but blocks certain sites like Slacker Radio, Pandora, Flycast, because they are music streaming sites. So in reality your web(free speech issues aside) is not really unlimited even though you pay specifically for a data plan. Also even though the service is supposed to be 3G, the coverage is so poor and slow it is almost irrelavent. Even in areas advertised as the prime coverage areas my phone would fluctuate between 3 and 0 bars out of 5 bars possible. I called customer service to find out why I was not recieving unlimited web service when I was unable to use Slacker Radio and was told that site is blocked. A second customer service told me it was metroweb and not real internet and that there was nothing he could do for me. I asked him to hold on one second because he was very short with me as if I was wasting his time. I wanted to get a pen and paper to get his name and csr ID. Instead of transferiing me to a supervisor, he put me on hold so I experience MetroPCS elevator music for over 30 minutes. I called back on another phone while I left the original phone on speaker blasting the elevator music. I explained what happened to the new CSR who acknowleged hearing the MetroPcs elevator music and he said he would get a superviser. After 45 minutes he was unable to get me a superviser. He kept apologizing and eventually both lines were simply disconnected. Needless to say I had my phone number ported to Sprint and now pay an extra 13 dollars per month and have everything unlimited for real except voice calls during peak hours to land lines. However I mostly call mobile phones anyway and text so the the limited minutes will not affect me too much and my new Sprint blackberry is no longer crippled. Sprint happens to have unlimited mobile to mobile on any network and I rarely call a landline anymore, it seems everybody does business on thier cell phones or you are probably calling an 800 series number. There is no comparison between the customer service, call service or data service between MetroPcs and Sprint. My experience with Metropcs was a huge disappointment. I need professional cell service and MetroPcs is not professional grade. Its good for your kids if you have any who dont really need realiability and who don't travel on business and will never call customer service and you dont want to worry about them exceeding usage allowances since voice and sms and email are unlimited. Basically as a percentage of the service and quality you get MetroPcs is half or less as any other major carrier for about the 10 percent percent less money. Its not worth subscribing to MetroPcs to save 13 dollars per month.. Updated. on Oct 14, 2009.

Pros:. Good price,free to call.plus (internet / message). 
Cons:. Customer service was too bad,they can't answer my questions,and it quality of the sound at my phone and customer service was bad.internet like joke. 
Summary:. After I get the phone ,I was really happy.. I play every thing on the phone.First thing my friend told me he hear my voice on the phone is same as fefore,but on my ear was something difference,one of my friend leave me a message(he don't say his name)I was thinging he was other people( quality). The screen of my Samaung phone was too small,the internet was so slow and hard to see,just like a joke,I try to ask to exchange other phone at next day,but she told me ,I can't do it ( I us it more than 60 minutes),. I get the bill show on my phone when I go home,I was call the customer service,to ask about what is first month free,but they can't get me the answer,and told transer me to correct dept.But my line is cut off after it,I call them again,the people was answer my phone,but the voice quality was really bad,she can't hear me &#38; I can't hear me too,I told it was the first trouble I get now.But we can't talk any more about the non worth connection..

If you stay at NYC forever.( never travel out or take Vacation) ,it may be good for you.Less money , but less service , Ha Ha.. 

$$;
Pros:. Truly unlimited calling and texting for a good price.. 
Cons:. Very limited coverage area, spotty quality, and a poor excuse for customer service.. 
Summary:. If you live in one of the few coverage areas, don't plan to travel with your phone, and have no reason to call customer service, then MetroPCS is probably a good choice for you. I must admit, they mean it when they say unlimited. Unlimited calling and messaging (whether text, picture, etc.) is always standard and for a great price. The true downfall of this service (which is otherwise a great idea) is how limited it can be.. If you constantly travel or go out of town, there's a huge chance that your phone will be useless. A year and a half ago I lived near Tampa, FL where service is available. I took a trip to a Students of German convention which was held in Daytona. The last place I was able to use my phone was Orlando. For three days, I was unable to call back home or receive calls from my teacher who was leading the trip. I believe that Daytona has now been added to the coverage area, but at the time I was very disappointed. When I did get service, the call quality had a tendency to be very poor.. Also, good luck trying to get cool stuff for your phone. I tried continuously to buy a ringtone for my phone, but they made it nearly impossible for me. The customer service is outstandingly bad.. This service has an opportunity to be a great carrier, but until they can do some housecleaning, this may not be the company for you. However, if you plan to stay in the same area (assuming it's available) and don't mind paying a bit extra for a phone, this could very well be what you're looking for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Convenient, economical. 
Cons:. Horrible customer service. 
Summary:. This is a great service and I hope they will work on their customer support, it is very, very bad. I have been a Metro PCS customer for 2 years and every time I've had to call them I get a headache.. First, you have to figure out how to get past the irritating voice computer, once you've done that, it's hit and miss to get someone that actually knows what they are doing.. I plan on keeping the service for now, but as my business grows I may be forced to change providers because I just can't deal with the lack of support.. Metro, get your act together!.

I ALWAYS WANT TO GO TO FACEBOOK BUT ITS HECKA SLOW IT TAKES LIKE 3 MINS TO LOAD A FREAKEN PAGE!!!!! I just wish MetroPCS was just like Verizon and AT&#38;T but still... no contracts.... I have MetroPCS my self I have the Samsung Messenger.... IT BROKE 2 TIMES! The first time, It fell the 1st time and the screen went all white, then the 2nd time, it broke in half!! So now I still have a different phone. My first phone was Red but they gave me a Black phone but with the same cover to cover the battery!!!! You see? MetroPCS or should I say Metro Piece OF S!@$ is a poor company! I rather get Boost Mobile!!.

TRIED TO TAKE IT BACK TO DAY LESS THATN 7 DAYS AND LESS THAN 1 HOUR WORTH OF TALK TIME WHEN IN THE CONTRACT IT SAYS WE COULD BRING IT BACK WITHIN 7 DAYS NO MORE THAN A HOUR TALK TIME AND IN NEW CONDITION I JUST GOT THE PHONE YESTERDAY.

Pros:. ITS NOT SUCH A BAD PRODUCT, THOU THEY NEED TO CHANGE THE PLAN FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT USE IT MUCH.. 
Cons:. WELL THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. THERE TRAINED TO SAY YES MAME. IM SORRY. BUT THEY DONT HELP YOU. AND YOUR LUCKY IF U CAN GET A REAL PERSON TO TALK TO YOU.. 
Summary:. ITS NOT THE PRODUCT ITS THE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SER. AFTER U GET SOME ONE U ARE MORE UPSET THEN BEFORE U STARTED. TO BAD IT WAS A GOOD CONCEPT THAT JUST WENT BAD. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY FRUSTRATING.PEOPLE WE JUST NEED TO STOP USING THEM MAYBE THEY WILL THEN CHANGE THEIR WAYS.. 

$$;
Pros:. I cant think of one thing good about the service that Metro PCS provides.. 
Cons:. Poor service areas--towers go down and no service for hours, customer service reps are extremely rude.. 
Summary:. The phone service in the SF bay area went down supposedly and so there was no service for 6 hours 2 days before Thanksgiving when everyone is trying to make arrangements to go somewhere. You could not access their customer service or emergency lines. Finally after 6 hours you were able to contact Customer Service and they say that there is a problem in the SF Bay Area and it would be an additional 2-3 hours before it is repaired. When asked what kind of compensation they will give me for my inconvenience they offer a $2 credit for 2 phones!!! Then try and tell me it is only a 1 time courtesy---I explained to the Rep that I understand it is not his company but please do not refer to this as a courtesy that a multi-billion dollar company is making by giving me a lousy $2 credit. Top it all off they thank me for being a loyal customer---Loyal my butt this was the last straw and now if I have to take it to the airwaves and post up flyers I will---god forbid I would have had an emergency and no way of calling out!. 

$$;
Pros:. It's not too pricey and let me do all the talking and texting I want.. 
Cons:. The plan I payed for did not provide all of the services listed. 
Summary:. I had the $50 plan.I was told i could talk and text when I moved to another state for college. False. The misinformed me about changing the network and now im stuck in a diff. state without a working cellphone. I have no choice now but to switch to a different service. Several sales reps failed to tell me I needed to program my phone in a certain way before leaving and if I didn't the phone would not work at all anywhere. If I do move back to my home state after college I'll probably not use Metro pcs. 

$$;
Pros:. When I first got the plan it was pretty good unlimited talk time was awesome...the phone were a bit more expensive but over I liked the idea of no dang contract. Especially after leaving sprint.. 
Cons:. There are too many hidden fees and service is terrible.. 
Summary:. The customer service is awful, the people in the store are not trained, I don't know how you can run a business without training your people...the service over the phone is the same way...its like they opened the stores and then asked people off the street to run them. Im changing to another unlimited service soon... 

$$;
Pros:. Unlimited Talk, Data, Text Messaging, etc etc. 
Cons:. Severe limitations on what you can do with your phone. 
Summary:. Bluetooth Limitations: Most if not all of Metropcs bluetooth enabled phones restricted to Serial, Audio and Stereo profiles. No direct way to connect to your phone with your pc via bluetooth, except for slow serial connection. Must use USB alternative.. MetroWEB Limitations: Cannot download website content from MetroWEB to your phone, will give you an evil 'content type not supported' message. Even with broadband speed capable connections, cannot stream video because severe limitations of MetroWeb. Unlimited data package is useless.. Most if not all phones do not support Java applications. They use BREW technology, all games and applications must be digitally signed to work on your phone. You must pay for all of your games and applications.. Just want to talk all day? Use MetroPCS.. A hobbyist? Find something else.. 

$$;
Pros:. ok phone, unlimted minutes. 
Cons:. Customer service hangs up on you, bad coverage. 
Summary:. This is a horrible misteak to get metro pcs they always lie to you i asked them before i bought the phone how much will it be with taxes and everything and they said 50 bucks a month for that 45 plan i said ok signed uped and then when i had it a few day i called 611 and it said my bill will be 56 dollars due on the 11th i was like that guy told me 50 and i told customer service that and they hung up on me ***WARNING DO NOT GET METRO PCS THEY LIE AND RIP YOU OFF THEY ALSO HAVE VERY BAD SIGNAL IN DAYTONA BEACH FLORIDA STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unlimited minutes, flat-fee texting, simple pricing. 
Cons:. Plans restricted to local originating area, out-of-area calls are really expensive (10 min. call = at least $4.90!!!!), call quality poor, no live agents. 
Summary:. I'm in Oakland, CA. I have been ambivalent about which cell phone to switch to from GoPhone for awhile.. I finally decided to still maintain my contractual freedom by going with MetroPCS. This is day three and already I'm irritated. Voicemail was not activated correctly, had to go back to the store where I bought the phone to get that fixed. It's fixed. But call quality is only okay, and downright poor using the phone's loudspeaker (and this particular phone gets really hot quickly against my skin).. This sounds like the phone's issue, not the carrier's, but I had to buy the phone and the cheapest is 90 bucks. Plus, though it's Nokia, the only accessory from my previous Nokias that work with this one is the charger. So, I'll have to shell out more bucks for an earphone and USB cord (to connect with my pc).. Since I've gotten the service, I have not been able to speak to a live agent other than those available for new service activation. Warning bell!. Consider this: Calls originating outside of the local calling area BEGIN at $.49/minute. That means a measly 10-minute call will cost a MINIMUM of $4.90! I asked them how they consider that competitive and, of course, the representative was clueless.. It's getting expensive folks, making me look again at the 2-year marriage offers from the big 3 or 4 (I never know if Sprint is still in love with Nextel or if they are about to split up).. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the idea of paying only $50 for unlimited phone, email, and Internet - I am paying over $120/mth with a national carrier. The MetroPCS call quality is fine in Brooklyn, NY.. 
Cons:. Customer Service SUCKS - A customer service rep told me that she could not discuss my problem on the phone, and I had to go to a corporate store. I called the corporate store where I activated my service and got an answering machine.. 
Summary:. MetroPCS was supposed to port my phone # over. MetroPCS sent an incorrect account number to the national carrier so my phone # was not ported over. I assumed that the delay was caused by my national carrier's reluctance to transfer the account until the end of my billing cycle, so I did not contact MetroPCS or the national carrier right away - big mistake. When I called my national carrier after almost two weeks, I was told that MetroPCS had submitted an incorrect account number to the carrier.. I called MetroPCS customer service and was informed that the representative could not discuss my problem on the phone because I had a high security restriction on my phone (BULL----) and in order to address my problem, I had to go to a MetroPCS corporate store. That was enough for me to hear ? I was through with MetroPCS after that news.. I went into the MetroPCS store and was told that I they could correct the problem by submitting the correct account number to my national carrier. That was not good enough for me because I had joined MetroPCS in order to save money, and during the two weeks that MetroPCS did not port over my old phone number, I had to pay my national carrier $60 and pay for MetroPCS service also. MetroPCS was also not willing to refund any portion of my service charge or accept return of the MetroPCS phone. I was told that I could not return the phone because I had the MetroPCS phone for over 7 days ? even though MetroPCS breached whatever contract I had with them by not porting over my phone number in a timely manner, and I am not able to receive calls on my MetroPCS phone. As far as MetroPCS is concerned, I should have gone into a corporate store as soon as I noticed my phone number was not ported over.. Anyway, I cancelled my MetroPCS today. I guess I will have an extra phone to call out on for the next two weeks - until the end of my MetroPCS payment cycle. I am out about $150 ? the cost of the phone, calling service, and protective cover for the phone. All in all, this is a small price to pay for realizing that I cannot live with a phone service that refuses to address my phone problems over the phone and requires me to address all concerns at a corporate store. What would have happened if I were in a city that did not have a MetroPCS corporate store, had no other phone, and had a problem with my MetroPCS phone?. Quite frankly, I would probably have stayed with MetroPCS and allowed them to correct the error if they had allowed me to address the problem with a representative on the phone, but the fact that the MetroPCS representative gave me a nonsensical reason for not addressing my phone problems over the phone was too much for me. If you are considering joining MetroPCS, I advise you to think long and hard about it - think really hard about it. I had myself and a lot of people convinced that paying less with MetroPCS was the way to go ? but found out really early that MetroPCS is not for me. MetroPCS customer service SUCKS. Cheap isn?t always better.. 

$$;
Pros:. The price only, but does not worth it!. 
Cons:. Very limited coverage area, spotty quality, and a HORRIBLE customer service.. The store never answer your call.. 
Summary:. Very limited coverage area, spotty quality, and a HORRIBLE customer service.. The store never answer your call.. I got a phone and was I not happy, so I went back the next day to return the phone but keeping the service, the customer service attendent told that I could not return the phone and start to argue with me.. They also don't have sam-card so you can't use an unlocked phone, and you are not able to copy your numbers to your new phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. CHEAP PHONE NO CREDIT CHECKS 40 FLAT A MONTH. 
Cons:. COVERAGE AND SERVICE ZONES ARE TERRIBLE, DALY SPAM DELIVERED TO PHONE. 

$$;
Pros:. its cheap, but you get what you pay for. 
Cons:. no service out side of highly populated areas. very poor customer service. i was overcharged for a replacement phone by the store at 433 sunrise hwy in lynbrook, NY and they don't care.. 
Summary:. i will be replacing my service. whatever you do don't use this service. 

$$;
Pros:. $40 per month for unlimited text and calls.. 
Cons:. Ads are misleading: it is $40 only if you sign up online. I get dropped calls and no signal a lot. I get calls from collection agencies for other people. Everyday I get at least three calls from random people.. 
Summary:. For a teenager or college student who needs something cheap, it is a good service. For someone who needs to conduct business, go get yourself a different service. The frequent dropped calls, lost signal, collection agencies and calls from random people (b/c of constant recycling of phone numbers) are a nightmare for anyone else.. Also, it is false advertising that the rate plan is only $40. It is only $40 online and if you go to the store it is $45. You can change it after the first month, but you have to do it yourself.. 

$$;
Pros:. The price $50/month includes everything- calls that drop, very sloooow text messaging and voice mail.. 
Cons:. Every call drops.. 
Summary:. Every call I makes drops sooner or later. If it is a short call it will drop at least once. A long call will drop several times. It doesn't matter where I am. Also, when I am on the call people say they can't hear me or I am breaking up.. When I went to the store several people were complaining their call are dropping and not being able to be heard. Metro PCS just replace a phone of a woman. When she made a call in the store and walked into the parking lot the call dropped twice. She had a different type of phone than me, so it isn't the phone, its Metro PCS.. It can take voice mails 3 days to become available. A text message can take 13 to 15 hours.. The customer service person at the Metro PCS store said Metro PCS isn't for everyone. This is the way Metro PCS is. She said her calls drop all the time, too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap as hell $40 a month and phones start at $29 and a good phone there is only. $99-150. 
Cons:. Bad customer support pain in the butt to get past thier voice actiavted computer, Had to file BBB report because they wont talk to me and lied to me, Most workers at stores are teens 16-20. 
Summary:. BAD SUPPORT. Alright i bought my Motrola hint had to get it replaced twice i did some research and the phone had a major defect lady at store said i had to go to the Corpate store to trade it in for a phone equal or less value i went there they said sorry you cant do that but i can pay $10 for another Replacement that is defected. Now i had to make a complaint with the BBB and they did what i wanted. but argueing with them did no good the lady said if you want to talk you have to come to the store hung up on me, Then they gave fake names, then they did not let me talk to the manajor ******** also i forgot my voicemail password they said i had to go a hours drive to the corparte store when all i needed to do was dial 611.. BAD COVERAGE. i tried to send a picture message to my firend it froze at 50%,tried again froze at 99%,tried again did not connect, then after 12 minutes i was able to succesfully send a picture message with 4 bars ********. My moms 2 year old nokia got 6 bars at the park, 4 at my school,and can send picture messages when she has 1 bar on metro? you need to have like atleast 4 bars to send one. at my school 1 bar or 0 and my moms phone full bars, Also the internet is slow as hell no youtube,music. NEVER GET METRO.

Pros:. Good phones and plans.. 
Cons:. The service ends up terrible.. 
Summary:. You wanna save money and have a good phone? Well don't get MetroPCS from the Network. I would get it from Best Buy becuz Best Buy's got good service and some of their phones are at Best Buy such as the Samsung Caliber. The Caliber is good. Boo MetroPCS!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price. 
Cons:. Their plans are not clear. Where it states text talk global you can send text but you cannot receive text, it very difficult get through to customer service and when you do they are not helpful at all.. 
Summary:. If you are looking for a fixed plan with no hidden fees then metropcs will be good for you, however they have very poor customer service and the initial services you can use on your phone will be taken away with not so much as a warning like metro navigator, at first you will be able to access those services and then after a while they take that service away which is so deceiving and then they will ask you to pay extra money if you want to continue to use that service.. 

$$;
Pros:. technical sounding name that disguises a brutally miserable network that is customer unfriendly. 
Cons:. Forget about any support, service, or even contacting the company by phone. Yes, you will reach a computer that will challenge you at every step but no human being.. 
Summary:. The coverage is spotty, the customer service is miserable, the support is non existant. Everything else is optional at extra cost.. Do yourself a big favor, and look to a different cellular company..

Pros:. calling plan OK. 
Cons:. Reception very poor. Customer service sucks. Are forced to pay bill by phone to charge $2.00 for this service. MetroPCS SUCKS!!!!.

Pros:. HORRIBLE SERVICE.. 
Cons:. Most of the phone they sell are of very poor quality. Their costumer service is very unhelpful; even the supervisors can't help you when you have an issue with their services. Their reception is limited.. 
Summary:. MetroPcs is a company that makes money out of people that let them get away with charging them extra for services that are of really bad quality. If you contact their costumer service 888-8metro8 you will be lucky if you can communicate with them. I have talked to multiple of them and they contradict themselves regarding any issue that you may have. When you ask for a supervisor or anybody that can make decisions (a more knowledgeable person) they will tell you to hold and they will end up saying that there is nobody available. The only way you will get somebody to really help you is if you are trying open a new account. I myself have purchased and know individuals that have purchased their phones and accessories in the past and found multiple defects and when you try for them to help you they will give you a hard time about it. Even if you have purchase insurance on the cell phones that you purchase from them, they will give you a hard time about it. They don't honor what they advertise and what their representatives tell you when you contract their services. The offer internet which is of the worst quality and a lot of the phones won't even work with the network they use. Recently I purchased a phone and accessories for the phone online and I only got the accessories, no phone whatsoever. I immediately called the number listed on the e-mail confirmation of my order. Their costumer service representatives couldn't tell me what I needed to do, they actually told me that the number I called wasn't concerned with online orders (well that is the number provided on their e-mail). It was obvious that they were just trying to make their job easier. After arguing with them for a while they finally got a supervisor who just told me to fill out a form online which I did. I asked him if he could help me so I could get my phone in a prompt manner and he said he had no contact with their shipping department. The next day I got an email from metropcsweb, all the message said was " A replacement will be shipping out tomorrow, thanks". That was it, nothing else. I thought that I would get the phone within a couple of days but I didn't get anything. I called them again at the number provided and after discussing my issue with them I was told they couldn't do anything and they went as far as to give me number to call which wasn't even a working number. I finally got the phone a week after I should of had gotten it and about 13 days after I had placed my order and about seven phone calls later. I paid for three day service but the replacement was sent via FedEx Ground. I was still happy I had finally gotten my phone. I tried to activate it through their system as it is specified through their instructions. Their system said that the phone couldn't be activated and that it would transfer me to a costumer service representative who would be able to help me. I then got a message that said that I had dialed the number incorrectly (me? dialed the number incorrectly??) well it was their system that transferred me so how could their system be so wrong. I attempted a couple of more times because I didn't want to deal with their costumer service again but I got the same message and again got transfered to a number that was dialed incorrectly. I finally got enough of their automated system and prayed that I would get my phone activated through one of their service representatives without much trouble. Well it seems that not even prayers work with this so called " MetroPcs Costumer Service" because I was told that they couldn't activate my phone and that I had to go to a an actual MetroPcs store. I asked the reason why they couldn't activate a phone I had already paid for and they said that they couldn't do it and that I had to go to one of their offices, no explanation whatsoever I asked to speak to a supervisor and they said that there wasn't any available and that if I wanted I could call back but that they would be able to help me at their store. Well I went to the store because I really needed to get my phone working, they had already charged my card and yet I didn't have a working phone. Next day when I had waited in line at their MetroPcs office I finally got to talk to their representative who told me to wait that he would be right back. He came back about 15 minutes later and said that he couldn't activate the phone because he had to fill out a form and that I needed to go back in 24 hours to have my phone activated. I told him that I had already paid for the phone and showed him the packing slips, he said that the phone was on a white list ( which he didn't know what it meant ) and that all I could do was go back the next day to see if their headquarters had gotten the form..... I had it with them, I cancelled their services and returned the phone and the accessories expecting to get a full refund as it is specified in the forms they sent me with my order. I hope they honor their Metro Promise.. HORRIBLE SERVICE, THE WORST..

Pros:. Be carefull of positive reveiws, I found the post listed below on Yahoo PCS stock message board. This is most likely an employee trying to rig the poll..

Summary:. All longs: Metro reviews on CNET 8-Dec-09 08:03 pm If you're a shareholder of PCS or a Metro user or both, support Metro by writing positive reviews on CNET.com. There appear to be a lot of negative reviews on cnet from the the beginning of the year and especially during the the summer months just before the rapid drop in the share price of pcs. I can't say that there is a direct correlation between these events, but hedge funds and the like have come up with more complex ways of beating down a stock.. When thousands of people look to CNET each day to read reviews just before making their purchase of a phone, reviews in many ways are the deciding factor.. It is not difficult at all for a hedge fund to enlist a small group of interns to make a concerted effort to bad mouth a company on product review sites. From a hedge funds point of view, bashing a customer review site is probably the easiest and least expensive way to have a DIRECT impact on customer growth, revenue, etc. &#38; for them it equals one less thing they have to worry about when holding a massive short position.. http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/metr.... 

$$;
Pros:. Good idea if it worked. 
Cons:. Calls dont connect and when they do then 100% of time they drop. Customer service is worst i have ever experienced. Don't waste your money on this service.. 
Summary:. Every call drops even when I have a strong signal. Customer service reps are clueless to there own service. Rep in store advised me after i already purchased to use a different service (nice of her to wait to tell me huh). Biggest rip off of any cell company.. 

$$;
Pros:. No pros at all now that ATT has unlimited talk and Text for $60.00. 
Cons:. Customer service is set up to prevent contacting an agent!. 
Summary:. My opnion is MertoPCs is the worst provider of any cell phone service!I called to attempt a GPS location of my lost cell phone. It took 30 minutes to get to talk to an agent. Their computer acknowledged that I wanted to talk to an agent but would not connect me to an agent. Their answering program is set up to prevent contact with a human if at all possible. After I finally got an agent and requested a GPS location of my phone, it had GPS! I was told " we don't do that"! I ask why and got the same answer! I was my only option was to kill the number and then buy a new Phone and pay for a completely new set up as they didn't do anything to assist customers on this! Why have GPS if the company supplying it refuses to GPS your phones location?? Why have customer service when all customer service is able to do is say "WE DON"T DO THAT!! Needless to say I dropped MetroPCS and have no plans to return! If you want virtually NO CUSTOMAER SERVICE AT ALL then MetroPCS is the place to go!. 

$$;
Pros:. See bottom-line summary. 
Cons:. See bottom-line summary. 
Summary:. I'd like to review - hell I'd like to buy - Metro PCS but I can't call Metro PCS to ask questions. The 888-8Metro8 phone doesn't work from pay phones "at subscriber's request". So ... I don't have a cell phone or even a landline since I'm now homeless but I'd like to have communication - other then two cans and a string - for job interviews.. Seems like I'd be a target customer for MetroPCS but how do I call them????.

Pros:. Nice looking red Samsung Slider phones. Unlimited minutes/text msgs.. 
Cons:. Zero customer service, bad phones that rarely get a signal.. 
Summary:. I foolishly purchased a Samsung slider phone for $179 plus tax because I was upset with how high my bill was with T-Mobile and refused to pay it. The phone worked fine for the first 4 days except for constantly receiving calls and text msgs for the gal who had that same phone # that I was assigned before me. That was annoying. Then after day 4, suddenly I'm unable to make outgoing calls/texts or receive incoming as well, because my phone was stuck on "Searching Service" mode. I had absolutlely NO SIGNAL. So when my car died on me on the way to work and couldn't call anyone, I was not happy. So that same day after work, I rushed over to the Metro PCS store where I purchased the phone and he sent me to another Metro store b/c apparently he couldn't help me. I went to their corp store location and was told that it was a defective phone, I would have to pay $30 to exchange the phone, and they were back-ordered on that particular phone and that they would call me in 3 days when it arrives. Well, it's been 8 days and I had to call them myself. They said the phones will arrive today. I asked them if I decided to not keep the new phone would I be able to get a refund and they said NO, and they do not take any phones back because they can't sell them, and I would have to try and sell it on Craig's List.. Bottomline, at I decided to get smart, I swallowed my pride, called T-Mobile, and decided to make payment arrangments to pay off my balance and just stick with them whom I've been a customer with for 4 years. At least with T-Mobile I am ALWAYS provided with outstanding customer service, I never have to worry about dropped calls or not getting a signal, and the reliabilty they provide is worth paying a little extra. So like the saying goes......You really do get what you pay for!. 

$$;
Pros:. I'd really like it if they would simply go out of business because they suck.. 
Cons:. Wow, only 150 characters to type what I *don't * like about Metro PieCe-of-Sh*t? Aren't you the optimistic one! I wouldn't even give it 1 star, but that's the lowest rating you have. You need a stick of dynamite or pile of cow manure we could use.. 
Summary:. had MetroPCS before and never had a problem. Loved the service and the phone. Then I got a free company phone I was also allowed to use for personal use. I hated that service, though, so after a couple of years, decided to get MetroPCS again. From day one, there were issues. First, they recycle numbers that HAVE JUST BEEN DISCONNECTED. Morning, noon and all times of the night, I was getting collection agency calls for some guy named Victor who never paid his bills, apparently. Then, even when I explained, the idiots would ask me, "Well, do you know Victor's new number?" How the heck would I know that?!!! IDIOTS!. Anyway, MetroPCS changed my number and then I'm getting collection calls for some guy named Luigi because, again, the number had only just been put back into circulation.. In addition to that, the service this time around was lousy. Dropped calls, bad connections, etc.. The final straw came when, as usual, I get a text message with my monthly bill of $47.92, which I paid before the due date, but the next day, I get a message I owe 25 cents. 25 CENTS!!! There IS no email address on their website to contact them, you have to call their stupid customer service number which will NOT put you through to a live person, but rather a recorded voice goes on and on about, "I understand you want to talk to a representative, but maybe I can help you. Say 'technical difficulties' or 'account balance' or absolutely anything but what I need. Finally, I just kept pressing buttons till I got a live person who informed me that since I didn't know my "secret code" which I only pressed into the phone 3 years ago to activate the service and HAVE NEVER USED THE STUPID SECRET CODE SINCE, that I had to go to the nearest MetroPCS store. Idiot. So, I waste my time and gas money going to the stupid nearest store to be told by the moron behind the counter there that a lot of people were getting the same message and that my phone wouldn't be disconnected, they would just add the 25 cents to my next bill. I said, "But that's stupid, I don't OWE 25 cents!" Then the brain-stemmed troll says that I need to call customer service. I explained that they told me to come to the nearest store. "Oh," the sniveling druid said, "They probably meant you have to go to the corporate office." I said, "Tell you what, Sunshine, just cancel my account and refund my money or credit my credit card, okay?" To which the pathetically IQ-challenged dolt says, "Oh, then you'll need to call customer service.". So then, I stabbed her to death. Well, no, not really, but the thought was tempting.. Why is customer service a lost art these days? So, I guess I'll be checking out some of the prepaid options of some of the other cell phone companies. I am NOT signing a stupid contract, that's for sure.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just horrible service!!!!. 
Cons:. drop calls every time; squeaking/static calls. 
Summary:. Just got 2 phones and decided to terminate the horrible service, but unfortunately have exceeded the 1 hour call time and could not return the phones. They in turn upgrade the signal, but just the same... could not receive signals especially when you inside a building. That reminds me for just a few days of trial calling hoping that the signal will improve that I suddenly exceeded the 1 hour limit for me to return the phones. O yea, everything works to the advantage of the company and not for the poor unsuspecting client/subscriber like me... Even with the upgraded signal, there are still the squeaking mice sounds who sing in the background whenever I call or receive a call.. It is like going back to way past then of the dark ages.. 

$$;
Pros:. None, it doesnt work. 
Cons:. I dont get reception in 95% of the places, even the 5% of places where i get it its very poor. I baught this phone becaus3e i didnt want to sign a 2 year contract with verizon. but now i am buying an iphone instead.. 
Summary:. Doesnt work 95% of the places. i tried to use it in Edsion, Rahway, Jersey city.......it doesnt do what a phone is suppose to do. waste of money. i got the $40 plan and pay $47.07 every month including the taxes, rather pay $10 more and go for a verizon or iphone. Atleast i will get to talk wherever i sit or travel.. had a horrible experience, would never recommend anyone to buy this phone. a disappointed customer. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works it is OK and inexpensive. 
Cons:. If you have a problem you get absolutely NO help. They do not want to hear about problems, peole at store level are rude and have very little if any brains.. 
Summary:. My wife, daughter and son HAD, Metro - unlimiteted family type plan. Since I am on a fixed income ran out of money before payment was due and was disconnected (exected no ay no service). Month before candcelled insurance on hone, since we were lied to about insurance but that is a while nother issue. For 4 days their system was down when trying to ay bill. Tried to talk to store person, she said system problems and she was on hold for 45 minutes. Came back later that day and she said come back tomorrow. I did, what I needed to do was cancel one phone, pay bill and make sure the insurance was cancelled. She told me I would have to pay, even for the phone I needed to cancel and would be billed again in 10 days. She said they will "probably credit my account for the cancelled phone, "probably". I told her Metro is not crediting me I want it off now and they never removed the insurance. She said she would have to call them, I said ok. I thought she called and was put on hold, she proceded to help another customer with a new phone and I was standing there patiently waiting. After 30 minutes I asked if this is going to take a long time again. She said she didn't even call, "They'll just say the same thing" I was pissed, this moron had me standing there waiting and she did nothing. I told her forget it!!! just cancel the SOB, loud in front of caustomers and stormed out of store. I personnaly have had T-Mobile pre-payed for about 7 years. Very few problems and they have actual customer service. I checked their plans and they have a FLEX PAY plan that almost matched Metro. Got my 13 year old on their plan (called customer service to ask questins and got an immediate resonse). She has the main thing for her unlimited texting (14.99/mo.) 300 anytime minutes, free weekends and 5 favorite unlimited friends. Total cost 54.00/mo - metro was 45.00/mo. For 9.00 more a month she has a real cell phone provider with actual customer service and coverage when we go down to south GA or the gulf coast. I hope more people check out the T-Mobile Flex Pay program, n credit checks or contracts. Great to d business with someone who actually cares about their customers even if you have a problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. There is nothing good to say after my experience with Metropcs. 
Cons:. customer service reps are rude and the store manager no better at the corporate store i visited in Las Vegas. I had problems with my new 160.00 phone and nobody cared. Calling the 1-888 number just gets you hung up on.Cancelled service .. 
Summary:. The call quality is poor. 

$$;
Pros:. unlimited calling is cool. 
Cons:. customer service will make you furious, then cry. They don't care, they just want the money and run. When I bought my $200 samsung messenger phone and it went dead 33 days later, Metro PCS wouldn't do anything.. 
Summary:. 1) The samsung messenger phone screen went dead 3 days after the Metro warranty went out. They did not have insurance available until a month AFTER I bought my phone. I don't know why the screen went dead. They said pressure damage but their is no damage, just a dead screen. I went to BOTH their "authorized dealers" with no luck. They accidently cancelled my service and then couldn't restart it because my phone had a dead screen. It was like a catch 22. So they had a solution for me: screw me. Go buy another phone. I am retired, fixed income. My son bought me the phone. I have been without a cell phone for a few weeks now, even though I am still paid up. I feel that metro is unfair, ignorant, and undeserving of our business and support. Take my advice and stay clear of this outfit, they will rip you off!. 

$$;
Pros:. A great concept for service.. 
Cons:. Not much more then a great concept, the service was horrible and the "customer service" was worse.. 
Summary:. It's not all it's made out to be. I couldn't get reception in my own house or inside buildings that were within the coverage area. The "customer service" is a joke, a bunch of people giving you the run around not knowing who does what and hanging up on you, I even had one person tell me there was no corporate phone number I could call to report the idiots. They gave me a refund...a month and a half after I canceled my service. Bottom line is just stay away from it, no wonder they're service is so cheap.. 

$$;
Pros:. really poor customer service. its cocisedered ghetto service, called getro! really bad customer service. whe works, it ok.. 
Cons:. kyocera is a crappy phone. k.312. 
Summary:. exremely poor customer service. thre clue is the three stooges intro,. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Price- Sounds good where it can be used. 
Cons:. Features don't work, no support, network always down. 
Summary:. Wow, they must look for call center workers that have been fired from other places. I cannot do anything on the website. I have yet to receive a call on my phone as all calls are forwarded and I cannot turn it off. I have tried conditional forwarding. If you take 2 of their customer service reps you will be luck to find a combined IQ over 200, you will probably hit the 150-180 range. I had 3 hang up on me tonight.. Their MO is, "can I put you on hold while I get the answer?" After 80 seconds you are disconnected. Find another service if possible.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Paperweight. 
Cons:. Dropped calls, System busy. 
Summary:. Worst cell carrier I have ever delt with. Had many since 1984. From dropped calls, system busy and limited calling area in the 'Tampa Bay' area in Florida. Currently with 'T-Mobile' and are quite happy with T-Mobile's service and call quaility.. 

$$;
Pros:. There are no pros about this service. 
Cons:. told most of east cost is covered not true. 
Summary:. In Conn. and tried to make a call to home just 40 miles from home in RI no service I'm getting rid of it at sucks only had it for 10 days not at all happy with it and the customer service suckes also. 

$$;
Pros:. Unlimited Text, Unlimited Picture Text, Unlimited U.S. calling, Unlimited Web for $40 a month. no contract. 
Cons:. cheap phones for expensive prices, horrible (2G) service, bad customer service, and everything else. 
Summary:. All of metro's phones seem like they are behined every other carrier in the U.S. Whenever they get a new phone they loose a phone and they only have about 20 to choose form. The plan that i have is good but the service sucks. I rarely have full bars on my phone and when i text at school under my desk it goes down to 1 bar. I thought it was just the classes but i tried it at home and it did the same thing. They only have 2G service but it's so bad its like 1G. All there phones are made of what feels like scrap plastic. They have phones that no one has herd of (of brand phones). They recently got a 4G phone, the Samsung craft, the 4G service is only in Dallas and Las Vegas. If you travel don't get this company. If you want to get cheap plans with good service and good phones get Virgin Mobile the monthly plans or Boost Mobile.. 

$$;
Pros:. MP3 player on phone works well.. 
Cons:. Literally everything besides the MP3 player. Apps don't work (including address book backup!), drops calls, poor coverage. Customer service is the worst I have ever experienced.. 
Summary:. I opened a MetroPCS account because I was tired of paying Verizon's exorbitant prices; after less than two weeks, I'm counting my blessings that I haven't dropped Verizon's service yet. Reception is spotty (in NYC, for heaven's sake), with frequent dropped calls. Apps do not work properly (I have been unable to back up my address book since I got the phone.. Customer Service is beyond horrible. There is no email support, and it takes several minutes of literally fooling the computer to get a live support tech. The only way to get it to put you through is to deliberately keep repeating nonsense (Monty Python's "splunge" works well) when it asks you what you want to do; after about six times of telling you it's having trouble understanding you, it will finally give up and put you through to a tech. This doesn't help much, since the techs are clueless, and unable to resolve any problems. Avoid this service at all costs, it may be cheap, but a comparison between this nonsense and Verizon has definitely reminded me that you get what you pay for.. 

$$;
Pros:. The bill .. 
Cons:. Metro does have hidden fee's , but the people are rude the service is defiantly not a good service . There not concerned with satisfaction of the customer at all .. 
Summary:. You should stick with a different company . The trouble is not worth it . When you call them about issues they basically rush you off the phone . They're rude and the service are horrible . Within months you may have issues even with insurance you will be stuck with a broke phone !. 

$$;
Pros:. cheap rate. 
Cons:. poor repss. 
Summary:. I do not like the customer service given by some of the Metro Pcs representatives. I was asked to leave the store located in Mesquite, Texas by Joe (rep) when I returned to asked for representation from a manager and not him after he failed to successfully transfer my phone service to new phone. I was treated rudely by Joe who accused me of requesting my second line's number transferal to my new phone. This was not the case, the second line's number was already active to my daughter's phone and was not the issue. He literally screwed up and BLAMED ME!!! After speaking to the manager and getting everything corrected this little creep had my second line suspended!!! I can't prove that he did it but I know in my gut he did!!! Isn't the CUSTOMER ALWAYS RIGHT???. 

$$;
Pros:. The monthly payment plan but they get you in the end. 
Cons:. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, bad recepten, bad apps,, bad web browser. 
Summary:. When you upgrade your phone and change your mind it is not returnable even if you return it the next day. To me their misleading return policies and bad customer service is enough to cancel my plan even if they are the cheapest. They ripped me off $220 for selling a smart phone that isnt so smart.. 

$$;
Pros:. The price is the only good thing about this provider, but remember, you get what you pay for.. 
Cons:. Absolutely no customer service! Mail in payments do not get processed promptly and service terminates! Also, reception is poor.. 
Summary:. Choosing Metro PCS is the worst decision I've made in a long time. Buyer Beware!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. cheap month to month.. 
Cons:. No service. Customer service SUCKS! Whatever you do, do NOT buy off of the MetroPCS website. I did and got completely screwed. They have NO WAY of tracking your phone. NO one can help you. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! anything else is better. 

$$;
Pros:. nothing nothing nothing. 
Cons:. everything new phone had to be changed 3 times dropped calls missed calls works in one room and not in another. 
Summary:. they charged me for international texting it did not work they told me the overseas provider hadnt signed up what nonsense is that? when you pay they charge you an extra 3.00 to take your payment. save your sanity go elsewhere there are many providers offer unlimited service for a few dollars more. 

$$;
Pros:. That you dont have to have a credit check, and you can quit whenever, thats about it. 
Cons:. Everything is a con with them, you basically pay 60 a month to text because you dont get service ANYWHERE. Also the customer service isn't customer service at all. 
Summary:. Basically the phone company is you get what you pay for. Yeah its dirt cheap, but you get dirt cheap coverage and customer service. Also don't ever get their insurance or even bother taking your phone up to a metro store if its messing up. One lady messed up my broken phone even more and reset a password on a old phone and forgot what she made it so i can't ever turn that one on again. I highly reccomend you to invest more in a real plan that use this pathetic excuse of a phone company. 

$$;
Pros:. a phone number for 40/month. 
Cons:. You might like the low rate but it comes with a high price, which is aggravation, poor service, dropped calls and really bad call quality. To add insult to injury they serve ads to your cell, so even if you turn down the ringer volume, it blasts ads.. 
Summary:. Save yourself, pay the extra 50 and go with a major carrier like Verizon or ATT, although quality will vary based on location.. Updated. on Jun 22, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. I thought this was a good deal for the price even though I'm not one to use the web from my phone but the $40.00 for talk &#38; text was nice........ or so I thought. 
Cons:. Almost immediatly I began getting pop up like weatherbug, word of the day, &#38; commerical type info sent to my phone, which locked it up until I took the battery off and then re-assembled it.. 
Summary:. Customer service at both the store and the number to call refuse to help. The person at the store could not get the apps turned off and had me call customer service who told me they could not help me that I needed to contact the store. By the way in order to get around the computer answering service who is bent on not letting you talk to a live person, you have to call them from a non PCS phone! I finally talked to a manager who assured me she had fixed all my problems and I would not be getting these pop ups from them any more &#38; guess what, I get 3 -4 a day which are still locking up my phone until I notice it and remove the battery. Not the kind of service you want if you depend on knowing someone is trying to call you, because you wont while the phone is in the Frozen State.. 

$$;
Pros:. NOTHING!!!. 
Cons:. 1) THEY CHARGE YOU MONEY FOR NO REASON!. 2) it takes about 1 minute just for the text to send (with good coverage). 3) it took me time just to get to customer service. 4) slow internet (with good coverage). 5)COSTUMER SERVICE IS BAD!. 
Summary:. : i wasted a lot of money on a cell phone that i DO NOT RECOMMEND! DON'T GET metro PCS! i only had metro pcs for only 2 months... they charge you a lot of money for NO REASON! One day, i remember i had exactly 105 dollars in my cell phone balance. when i checked my balance, i had 100.43 dollars. and they kept on cutting at least 5 dollars every week. so i recommend everyone to stay away from metro pcs. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing.............can't name one! They desreve -0 stars!. 
Cons:. Terrible Customer service. Misleading ads (Everything for $40 a month and 3G Network). Discontinued phones at outrageous prices. Phoney smartphones. Bad coverage. Upgrade fee....................for a phone that wasn't even an upgrade. 
Summary:. After being with Metro PCS for so long, I decided to go with T Mobile because of the following reasons listed above. Although my plan was suppose to be $40 for unlimited text, talk and web, my bill would always be between $50 and almost $70 a month. Also, when I went out of town (Still in my home state), I had no Metro service and to top it all off,. I was lost and needed directions to get to my sisters wedding in Winter Garden. Their so called smartphones are a rip off. The applications are very limited and you can't download anything outside of the Metro applications without paying for them. I do take that back, I did use Myxer.com to download ringtones for free but I couldn't still download a lot of things...still very limited. I saw a commercial where Metro advertised that their network is 3g..ha! My signal to connect to the internet ran so slow, I could go to work and it would still be loading and half of the time, the connection was out. The only time their service ran at top speed is if I stood outside. A lot of people that I know who have Metro knows this. Try watching a YouTube video on the Metro network. It takes forever for it to work and even when it's running, the people may be talking but the image is still. There were times I purposely ignored phone calls and was left a voice mail which I would receive about an hour or 2 later after the person has called. The customer service is so bad......are these people competing with Sprint for the worst customer service title? I've switched over to T Mobile after a friend of mine sold me his broken My Touch 3G for $20 which I took it to be repaired for $70. I took the phone number that I've had with Metro for so long rather than get a new one. The people at T mobile were so friendly and gave me free headphones for my phone and a carrying wrist band which I like because it helps me from dropping my phone.. Also, I paid nothing walking into the store and my bill will not be due until the middle of next month and it won't even be the full amount. The coolest thing about it is that I'm not under contract at all and still get all the same benefits as if I were on a plan. Look at the Tmobile website for their Even More Plus Plans. The network is real 3G and the phone that I have, I can download free apllications from games, music, tv shows, watch YouTube, bid on Ebay,etc from applications in the Android Market. My phone has replaced my computer in a way. The only time I really use my computer now is when I see my friends on Skype. I can go anywhere now and not have to worry about going into an area with no service, receiving bad service, paying silly fees to pay your bill, paying for old phones, misleading ads, differently priced bills. For the price I paid Metro, I now pay through T mobile but, I can reach a customer service agent 24/7 on the phone talking, computer or mobile chat with them from my phone. I almost forgot to mention that I purchased a cheap $59 phone called the Kyocera Laylo for a relative for their birthday. I thought that all I had to pay was the $59 plus tax. Well, the total came out to $74.90. Why? Well apparently, Metro has come up with another pathetic way to rip you off.............This time they call it an Upgrade fee! An upgrade to what? The phone my cousin had before was a simple, basic phone. No qwerty keyboard, no watching videos or listening to music with an SD card.......just a simple flip phone made by Huawei that I think he may have paid $50-80 for. I was very upset at this point and told the woman that I was so glad that I'm not with Metro anymore. Why put up with all of their abuse and still pay Metro every month so president of the company can live better? You need to remember that they need you, you don't need them. There are other companies out there who can offer you what you want. Why complain and still throw your money away because Metro is convieniently every where and because they are "Cheap"? I'm not going to take their crap and make them rich. I suggest that you go phone carrier shopping and let them know that you do have options. I'm never ever going back to Metro PCS.....NEVER EVER!. 

$$;
Pros:. The price is fantastic, wish all cell phone companies can add the fees into a low monthly payment.. 
Cons:. Slow network, I just purchased with them. Though, I had to return the phone the very same day.. 
Summary:. I pretty much dislike the whole product, though the price is awesome! This is best for the young crowd, such as young teenagers. And for parents who worry about overage fees, metro pcs is the way to go. Today I purchased their product, and when I said hello hello hello to metro pcs, i had to say bye bye bye the very same day. Slow network, could not call out to other US locations kept getting a message that I need to buy a phone card to continue. In my mind, I was saying WHY? My plan is unlimited! It includes all the features. Also, when dialing a number, it takes about 8 seconds for me to hear the ring ring. I would probably wait until metro pcs decides to upgrade their network, and improve. Especially catch up to the new 3g/4g networks. In order for them to compete, they must be in the same league as the popular carriers. Still offering the same great price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amusing TV ads which lets us laugh at minorities.... 
Cons:. Racist outfit. Poor service. 
Summary:. MetroPCS has never been highly regarded. Of over 100 reviews here on CNET, the company has garnered a whopping 2-star review on average (out of 5). MetroPCS hail-mary response is one of desperation- most recently using an advertising campaign that seeks to get cheap laughs by mocking Indian-Americans. If this were about East Asians with a buck-toothed ******** saying "me so sohhy" over and over again, it would be pulled immediately. Instead, they've wisely chosen a community which rarely fights back. Nonetheless, its hard to avoid the conclusion that MetroPCS resorts to racist humor in order to push a mediocre product. Mocking the Indian accent for its ridiculousness may get a rise from the TV and radio audience, but its hardly a long-term strategy for a cellular company that has had consistent cell tower issues and limits you from calling out of town.. 

$$;
Pros:. I liked what they offered, unfortunately they changed their offer without informing me and it now appears as though metro PCS doesn't offer international calling. 
Cons:. This is a phone company that would do well in the third world. Customer support not based in an english speaking country - difficult to hear and and be be heard when calling support - difficult process to get through their automated system.. 
Summary:. Supposed to get free international calls (to most land lines) with my phone "plan" but i cant even connect to any numbers abroad - free or not free! Maybe international calls to Mexico and Latin American countries are possible since thats where their customer support is based, but to not be able to connect to the UK - thats absurd.. They want me to buy and carry international calling cards as though this is a third world phone service. I wouldn't even give them 1 star and to think i switched from Sprint for this - at least Sprint overcharged but gave you the ability to make phone calls. Urgh. Stay away from this company.. 

$$;
Pros:. no contract. cheap. 
Cons:. you get what you pay for. 
Summary:. So i purchased a Samsung Caliber at Best Buy. the phone ended up being defective so i returned it an got my money back. that same night i called metro to get a refund for the plan charge($50), when i got to a rep i explained the deal, she looked over my account and had me on hold longer then she actually talked to me, when she finally came back on she said, "i confirmed with my supervisor, and your going to have to go to a corporate store to get your money back", i felt like this was bull, being that i paid over the phone with them and not at a "Corporate Store"... i went to the store the following day(Sat), i explained to them what happened, and they looked at me like i was stupid, "you didn't pay thru us why would we refund you" but they were nice enough to direct to another dep. called billing matrix which weren't open till monday, i finally called today(Mon) and the rep there said he couldn't do anything for me that i needed to talk to metro, so back to the original dep i went, there a rep told me that the service was active and that they couldn't refund my money, so basically i wasted all this time and i still lost out, but she had a brilliant idea, why didn't i just go out and get a new phone so i could use the service... at that time i asked for her supervisor, i went on hold for ten minutes for her to come back and say, "my supervisor looked in to your account and it seems this line has only been active for 6 days so you qualify for a refund"... i hate there CS so much. took me 4 days to get my money back, and just to go back to the same dep. where i had asked for it originally .... 

$$;
Pros:. ok price, ok phone. 
Cons:. horrible costumer service!. horrible costumer service!. horrible costumer service!!!!. 
Summary:. If you are planning to get metro pcs service be aware that you will be dealing with problems for hours! There is absolutlly no way of explaining the level of incompetence in their staff, it will blow your mind!!!!They don't do test calls on your phone so if you run into a problem you have to hang up and call your own phone and call them back as many times as necesary, I did that 8 times, for 2 hours, to activate my phone. So good luck!. 

$$;
Pros:. nothing i like about this service i dont even care about the cheap bill anymore. 
Cons:. i dont like the service anymore and its only my 3rd day using it, i fell like i want to throw this celphone if it wasnt i buy the blackberry!!!!!. 
Summary:. i dont like the service bcoz it keeps repeatedly got out of service on me not even a 1 min of conversation i am so disappointed! even if you talk to person with the same service it still get cut off.. Updated. on Feb 20, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. cheap plan. no contract.. 
Cons:. no signal where there should be, like Washington DC and Annapolis. TERRIBLE customer service. Faulty phone, call waiting NEVER worked. They would not refund or let us upgrade to new phone. Unable to call sprint from metropcs.. 
Summary:. In the three weeks we've had Metro PCS, we have HATED them. Firstly, in the first week my husband had his phone, he could NOT call me (I"m on a sprint network) - there was a problem with metropcs cell towers. WHen he needed to call me, he had to pull over to a payphone to call me. His employee, also on metropcs, could not call me on the sprint network. On the 8th day, however, they fixed the problem. Then my husband went to Washington DC and Annapolis and could not get a signal at all. Metropcs's response? Well, maybe he should try roaming, at an extra charge. I said "but you're supposed to WORK in that area" - their response "oh well, too bad." Thirdly, all this time he has not been able to use call waiting. When he pressed the talk button, he cut everyone off - which is most frustrating and he lost customers because of this. He finally took the phone back and surprise surprise, they said it's faulty - so they are ordering a new one. He asked if he could upgrade to a better phone, and they said sure, but we will not give you ANY money back on this old phone - it's USED! He said but it's faulty - and after all the problems we've had, why can't you help me = I want to pay a lot more money and get a better phone but you MUST give me some credit for this phone - they refused. I spoke to Jose Fernandez in the store in Hialeah - a more useless cretin you could not find anywhere on this planet. I told him all these problems, and he said "I'm so sorry", so I said "that's nice, but what are you going to do about this?" and he said "Nothing." THEY COULD NOT CARE LESS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. They have a good monthly plan if you don't mind dropped calls and terrible reception and no signal when you leave Fort Lauderdale or MIami - but they are just awful. The worst customer service in the entire world - definitely the worst experience I have had. I remember the very next day after my husband first got this plan and the new phone - we were unhappy with the phone and we wanted to take it back - and my husband had used 1 hour and 12 minutes of talk time - AND THEY SAID NO WAY! YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS PHONE, you only have 59 minutes of talk time to use before it becomes a USED PHONE and we will not take it back. Seriously, I cannot use the language I"d like to use to describe the services of Jose Fernandez and his boss, Richard, at the Hialeah store, more useless, non-caring, impartial, pathetic people you could not wish to meet. I rue the day we EVER switched to metro pcs and will be canceling at the endo f this month. AVOID AVOID AVOID. I have to say I love Sprint - but I wish they had a cheaper "unlimited talk" plan, then my husband would switch to that, but as it is, they are too expensive. You get what you pay for. Metropcs is cheap and 80% of the time doesn't work!. 

$$;
Pros:. SEEMINGLY COST EFFICCENT.....BUT.... 
Cons:. PLAN IS GD, BUT SERVICE IS BAAAAAD, AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE ARE NOT KNOWLEGEABLE ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS.. 

$$;
Pros:. nothing at all for sure. 
Cons:. lack of customer service,can't even get on webpage most times, Lousy coverage,many useless, costly features.Lack of any 'standard of service' in this brand, the dealers are only in it to make a buck from customers who really can't afford cellular. 
Summary:. I do not know why anybody would want to exist with this kind of "service"..perhaps its all they can afford, but they can go prepaid for the same price and at least get better signal service from one of the 'big guys'... The equipment is flimsy and lacks performance.... I am getting my old Verizon equipment out and going back to Page Plus Cellular(uses Verizon towers)to at least get a decent reliable signal with tested equipment...Want to waste $3-400, give Metro a try...... Updated. on Sep 3, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Fixed priced plans. No surprise charges.. 
Cons:. Phones are NOT portable. Oversubscribed. Overloaded. Under provisioned.. Service, connectivity, stores, tech support, pretty much everything else.. 
Summary:. Unlimited plans, especially Unl. International, is way oversubscribed. I was unable to get through after the first month. Suspiciously appears that the line may be de-prioritized. Only new customers can get through. You still hear a ring tone, but the call never goes through. How deivous is that!. Don't be fooled by their ads. They should be thoroughly investigated by the FCC. Enterprise customers will never use them. Only the schmucks on the street sign up with them, and then you're stuck if you paid for the $200 phone. That's why their super cheap intro plans can only be applied for a new account with a new phone purchase. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. plan seems good . no ctracts. 
Cons:. phone coverage sucks. phone suck. 
Summary:. I work for Metropcs not a corporate store but an authorized dealer .customers always tell me that in ohter stores besides the one im in that they treat there customers like 5h!t . so i decided to go pay my bill in of the corportate stores as soon as i entered the store theres a huge line and alot of people are mad . when it was my turn (which took around 15min) i told them i wanted to pay my bill they told me that they wiont do it because this the employees where busy . they where on outside smoking . so i tried calling there customer service line for a customer OMG they made the customer service so that you wont be able to get to an agent . over all im highly dissapointed with them even though i work for them !!! .. 

$$;
Pros:. Great price on calling plans, but as soon as you walk in the door.... 
Cons:. I went to two corporate owned stores in Nevada. Both stores operate exactly the same. As soon as you walk in the door, you'll get the incredibly BAD service from employees and management.. 
Summary:. Their prices will tempt you to see what they are all about. Once you see what they are all about, you'll be happy that you stuck with your $70/month plan at AT&#38;T, T-Mobile, or Verizon.. 

$$;
Pros:. They are cheap (a good deal 30$ a month Unlimited text and talk! Wow...), maybe that's why their service is so crappy!. 
Cons:. Horrible Customer service (explained below) very hard to deal with!. 
Summary:. So, they have this new phone the Samsung Freeform. Around thanksgiving we go there, they are advertising for it like crazy, so we put our name down for one and they promise it'll be in for us in 2 days. On the second day we go back ask, they say that they still hadn't received it, very sorry etc.etc. This is fine, things happen. Though this repeated itself around3 times, us going in and coming out empty handed. I call them on December 11th, and they say that they have 1 left! I asked if they could put it on hold for us, and the guy said sure, just make sure to come in 24 hours to pick it up. Today December 12th we go back to the store, very exicted (new gadgets are always FUN!!!), We go in, we tell the guy we are here to pick the phone up, he looks at us like we're crazy and goes to look for it. Comes back empty handed. Asks who we speaked to, and says that the guy should have put it on hold for us... Call's this other employee up and asks about it, and he tells him that he sold it a few hours before. He tells us the news, and we are like WHAT THE HECK? WE NEED A GOOD EXPLANATION?? He says that it is our fault because it has been sitting in the store for 7 days waiting and they need to sell it in 24 hours. We told him that we could the day before around 8pm (at that time it was 5pm), he is like, we ll no you are wrong.. Finally he accepts it is his fault (very snottily a Yeah well fine, OK I believe you), and tells us there is a new order coming in the next day. We are we ask him when? And he says he doesn't know. In the end we decided never to come back, they were far from their 3rd chance to make it up to us, it was like the 6th.. The BOTTOM LINE, they have horrible and very offending customer service, maybe that is why there plans are sooo cheap? Very Bad Company... Will never recommend to anyone again, please don't buy from them, you will just run into problems!!!. This was in the Holland, MI store (northside) if anyone cares to know.. 

$$;
Pros:. No Pros- Unless you like to Waste Time, Money and Enjoy Hours of Stress.. 
Cons:. Non Existant Customer Service, Fraud and Audacity To Suggest Buying into More Defective Merchandise!. 
Summary:. I have Numerous Accounts with Several companies for Phone service, My Family Lines- Work line and. Private lines for EMERGENCY USE ONLY- As a Business Owner I CANT be Bothered when at work Period!. Thus My reason for many Phones: Every Line is Important to my work, High Pace, Intense Pressure and. enough deadlines to bury a person without these crucial lines.. My Work Number is With Metro PCS- Through Years of Dropped Calls and Missing Texts. I did my best and I bought everything they suggested to remedy my problems.. New Chargers, Batteries and even Standing in places I might have better reception- this is the most. Ridiculous suggestion by far from the Manager of the Corporate Store!!!!. No one wants to Fix my Phone let alone touch it!. I Have ALL my paperwork - I bought all the extra Insurance and Warrantys - Bottom Line:. Even With the Receipt an Original papers and Box in hand:. Standing Face to Face. They CLAIM EVERYTHING I PAID For was EXPIRED!!!! I asked How can this be- the phone isnt even. My Purchase of 09 was tampered with changed to 08 ! !. I qualify for NOTHING- So they simply say give it to us and Purchase a new phone.. My Phone is 8 Months YOUNG!! Not even a Year old!!! I buy the newest of Phones to keep up with. technology to better produce in my line of work. I feel deceived, hoodwinked into spending money I thought. would keep taken care of.. Worst Of ALL:. No Place to report these fraudulent people, No number - Email- Nothing- just a flat. waste of $300.00 plus dollars for something that failed to properly perform.. You want advice:. Avoid Metro like the plague, these people are crooks -. you think "Hey, I need unlimited minutes to be able to do my job right- keep the masses updated" and buy into the hype!. PASS!! You get more trouble then its worth especially if you need inportant information and the call DROPS!!!. Your damn phone says it has good reception but still drops Call after Call - useless!!!!. Nextel is my family phone, 6 years and Ive never had an issue! If anything whent wrong I was helped!!!. For the Same Amount of years I've been a Metro Client and noticed a trend in what they call "upgrading". I feel like the send viruses or something when something is close to expiring just to make you think you need. a new phone.. Like I stated in the beginning:. With High Paced Jobs, Raising a Family and having Zero Time to make any sort of adjustments in schedule. How on Earth can you compensate Lost Family Time when you're chase'n these Crooks to fix defects in. a phone?. Or Worse - Not being able to go cancel or do much of anything because of being so busy.. Its a hard Comprimise.. 

$$;
Pros:. the unlimited usage of everything ...... 
Cons:. dropped calls(yea in the city!unreal!),web works when it wants to,can't send a mms to multiple ppl at once,you don't get what you pay for,the phones are crappy,and the list goes on.. 
Summary:. okay. i've been w/ metro for a month and a half now. i am so ticked and i'm ready to switch providers asap! they are soo aggervating! I live in a big city near atlanta and i have had dropped calls left and right since i have gotten my phone w/ them and the service. I mean what if i have a business call and my customer gets hung up on? that is so messed up! you don't get what you pay for. The internet works when it wants and sending mms messages takes all day. i'm going back to PAGE PLUS! They are on the VERIZON WIRELESS network!! goodbye METRO!!! feels like false adviretisement!. 

$$;
Pros:. Rate Plan(s) All you can eat rate plan is the wave of the future.. 
Cons:. Customer service is a laughing joke! (I expected more from a Texas based company). High customer churn. No online account management. (Advice: spend some money on an online cust servce portal and fire your CS Reps). Brand name is flawed.. "Ghetto"PCS". 
Summary:. I have worked in the wireless business for the past 11 years. I am very surprised Metropcs has made it this far in the game. I gave them a shot and activated 2 lines of service. Well.... the whole activation experience kept me laughing and scratching my head. I had nothing but trouble getting a new line of service activated. The 800 # cust service rep kept talking to me like he was a gangster in East LA.. MetroPCS is an embarrassment to the Lone Star state!!. 

$$;
Pros:. absolutlely nothing!. 
Cons:. Cheap phone for $80.00. Didn't work after 3 days. They refused to repair it or let me exchange even after I purchased insurance on it. Poor customer service.. 
Summary:. First, they lied to me by selling me a phone they told me was new. Found out it was used next day after shut off due to others non-payment. Not working properly after 3rd day of owning it. Dropping calls, rings while actually on phone, heats up after short time. Brought back to store and refused to repair or exchange after I had purchased insurance on it. Spoke with regional manager-told me to take it to Rhode Island to get repaired, and would cost me another $40.00. So disappointed-thought this sounded like a great plan. Now I am stuck with a used phone that doesn't work. This is a ripoff! They could care less about their customers. 

$$;
Pros:. nothing nothing nothing its full of ****. 
Cons:. suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucking service. 
Summary:. suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkiiiiiiing service and phones and company. 

$$;
Pros:. No contract required.. 
Cons:. Their customer service on any front--whether in-person, online or by phone--is abysmal. The phone products appear to be below par and forget warranty service; it's non-existent.. 
Summary:. MetroPCS targets and attracts people who are either strongly adverse to cell phone contractual service or, and most predominantly, whose poor credit gives them no option (prior to BoostMobile). As a result, they appear to be completely indifferent about the quality of service they provide.. I can't speak to the type of phones offered, but heaven help you if you have trouble with one. Products are replaced from items in the back room, unboxed. I think they take someone else's returned phone and give it to the next person.. Their SMS service is also unreliable. I am a T-Mobile customer and never have issues with SMS delivery except to my friends with MetroPCS service. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the delay in message delivery (other than it always seems to happen to the most important texts). Messages have been delayed anywhere from 20 minutes to 12-24 hours. While that might meet their contractual obligation, consistent SMS delivery delays are basically non-existent with any other service that I know.. They suck. I say, don't go there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap plans.... 
Cons:. No real web browsing. worst customer services - if exist. No online mangemnet of your account except bill pay. Very rude store people. Limited coverage. 
Summary:. Brought a phone.... Took all features includng call fowarding........ Call forwarding didnt work.... called customer service... does not get to the persons... tried and tried... finally got to one. He said service refereshed wait 15 min and try..... Not working. called again.... same answer not working again... tired of it..... Went to store... some lady came to me after speding 15 min with a guy..... She says call forwarding only works for local numbers only of that area code only and cannot be forwarded to other areas.. I told her that i needed that feature even if costs me money. She said she cannot do it.. I told her then take back the phone but she said she cannot take the phone back as I exceeded more than one hour talk time on phone... I told please check the call log as all the time i was trying to get customer service.. She said she does not have a way to checking call log but can check total phone usage time.... She said that she cannot take back phone. I asked her for written note on that as there is nothing in print that she has that says metro pcs cannot do a call forwarding to different area code. She asked me to leave the store.... That is what is in a nutshell my experience with Metro PCS. 

$$;
Pros:. unlimited use. 
Cons:. customer service / they take your money for service not rendered and will not give it back. call center gives you the run around.. 
Summary:. I posted a payment have the proof and they suspended my account / and will not give the money back / suspened and account and makes you pay for the service you did not receive. then wants you to make a payment again/ I quit the service and wanted my money back because I did not receive and service and they told me that I can not have it back. I dont know about you or not / but do you want to pay for something you dont receive? they will not even give you the corp office phone no..
