Pros:. The colors are amazing. Both HDTV/Blue Ray movies and games look superb. The nice soft dark black levels make it a stand out. I have yet to find a TV that matches it.. 
Cons:. None that I know of. I'm sure the energy on this tv is poor but its worth it. 
Summary:. Its a shame that they stoped producing this line of TVs. If you can score one online or Best Buy it will be well worth it. I have looked through Best Buys top TV room and have yet to see anything that matches it. Once you watch Planet Earth Blue Ray on this baby, you will understand. Buy one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is out of this world. Blacks are fantastic. Colors amazing. Just simply stunning picture and quality if this TV. 
Cons:. none - have been using this TV now for a year. 
Summary:. Those who were lucky enough to buy this TV while still on sale are really lucky. Best Bey no longer carries these as they were heavily discounted. If you can still find this TV, please do yourself a favor and get it. Usually sells for around $2,500. Now it lists for $4,500, which is its true MSRP. If you have the money get it, but shop around as you might still find good deals.. Amazing, amazing, amazing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything about this TV. 
Cons:. As far as the picture goes there is nothing to complain so far.. 
Summary:. For years I did not think Plasmas TV could be better than my Sony XBR 34 inch tube HDTV. I actually wanted a bluray player and got one at Best Buy at a very good price for a floor model - Pioneer BD 51. The picture of regular DVD was amazing on my Sony. Then I rented a bluray movies at blocksbuster; I was shocked at how good it looked. Now I wonder what bluray movies would look like on a larger screen TV and there happened to be an Elite displayed at Pacific Sales store. I took the same movies on DVD and Bluray comparing on my Sony and the Elite 111 for a few months. There was no doubt the Elite plasmas has so much more color and details. Then I stumbled on this website, read Mr.Katzmaier's review, wait for the new "Extreme Black Panel" comparable to the Sony OLED. But more bad new for Pioneer, they are getting out of the plasma business. I took the plunge and got one. I was so impress with the picture viewing at home, there was no comparison from a store to home. So two more after that, One 111FD and two 151FDs. Very happy with these TV but wished Pioneer could release the "Extreme black panel." There is one thing about the update on these TV. In my experience if you don't need it then should not do it. Before the update mine emit a little buzzing sound but after the update that buzz got louder. So I did not update one of my TV. The buzz did not affect the picture, just a little annoying and it might be my hearing. I had a technician came out to check on the TV and he could not hear anything. I like Mr. Katzmaier's picture setting and thank you for information. I tried these even after had mine professionaly calibrated.. 

$$;
Pros:. Crisp Vibrant Colors...accuracy out of the box is phenomenal...ability to customize picture(you don't need to) is amazing...Technology Bliss. 
Cons:. nothing..i would say price but i got my for a steal..so if you can find one of these still around strike up a convo with the sales guy and see if you can get a s steal. 
Summary:. I went into Best Buy over the weekend with the intention of buying the Pani 54V10..luckily they didn't have the 54 and I started talking with the sales assoc. about the Elite..It turns out that they had just sold a defunct set for around 1299..so i asked what he could do for me and i ended up getting the last unit there for a very attractive price..unfortuanately not 1299 but not to far from it...IT is amazing...I have been a fan of the XB8 / A950 and the V!0 but this tv will Blow those guys out of the water...the colors are so Crisp and Refined..not jutter or lag..just pure perfection... 

$$;
Pros:. The Elite series is great.. 
Cons:. I have no cons for this product.. 
Summary:. Yep. It cost a lot but you get what you pay for. I suggest a new power cord for the unit. It made a difference in the picture although just a little I could see the difference in the colors and sharpness of the picture.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Ascetically pleasing design. - Unobtrusive stylish trim on all sides. - Overall design appeal. - Outstanding picture performance. - Black levels enhance all aspects of the color spectrum. - Very good anti-reflective screen. 
Cons:. - Automatically shuts down when no signal is detected. Great feature for plasma owners but mine shuts down after a couple of hours with a signal. (perhaps I selected selected this feature from the menu). - Unit does produce a lot of front panel heat. 
Summary:. I researched for some time before purchasing this TV. I took into account a variety of factors including size, performance (picture quality primarily and 1080P capable), longevity of picture source and of course price. Typically I want the best performance I can afford but from a manufacturer I feel I can reasonably trust. I looked at plasma and LCD panels as well as a host of projection panels in the DLP, LCD product line. I could have gone less expensive certainly with a projection product and even other plasma products. For this purchase I had set my standards higher knowing this purchase would be a primary TV and I already had a two year old 46" Sony 3 LCD projection which gave a good picture in my bedroom armoire. I had weighed flat-panel vs. projection in that purchase as well nearly settling on a Panasonic 42" plasma but a few more inches of size, similar picture performance and less money won out but this purchase was most likely going to be a plasma.. Now down to nuts and bolts. I knew my maximum size was restricted to 50" considering it would be the centered in an entertainment unit I already owned. After much research I had settled on a 50" Panasonic Plasma product which received good reviews across the board and was considerably less expensive than the Pioneer Elite. Shortly after I made that decision I revisited the pros and cons of spending considerably more money on the Elite and during that time some very attractive sale prices surfaced on the Elite. I have NOT regretted the purchase from the moment I opened the box. Very snazzy unit with clean lines and attractive styling. After an easy set-up the moment I began using the Pioneer Elite I knew I made the right choice even with the premium price. There is nothing like turning on your new TV and loving the crisp, clean, vibrant picture without having to adjust it. Never have I not went straight to the menu and started making changes. The black levels are insane and really enhance the color spectrum you see. All scenes are near perfect and most deficiencies are most likely the result of the signal or age of the programming. Blu-ray movies are extremely clean with a 1080P source. The anti-reflective screen filters most light from well lit rooms and the very least makes it tolerable but in most cases a non-issue. You will not be disappointed with this plasma unit it looks good off and looks awesome on. In fact I purchased the 60" unit in the same line, the Pioneer PRO-151FD, with in two weeks afterwards for my media room I liked it sooo much. I was considering a projector on the advice of a friend in the industry but knew I'd miss the picture performance rather than the projectors versatile screen size which would have been much larger but at a picture quality penalty. If outstanding picture performance is a major consideration in your purchase you have to see this flat panel.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything is perfect from the blacks to the sound.. 
Cons:. Only the price. 
Summary:. Above explains all.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Best HDTV EVER MADE. - Great color accuracy &#38; grayscale. - Gorgous Frame/Thin profile. - Amazing features. - Home Media Gallery. - Anti-glare filter. - 170 degree view angle. - Light&#38;Color sensor. - Value: it is expensive, but WELL WORTH IT!. 
Cons:. - NONE. - Absolutely cannot find anything wrong with this TV. 
Summary:. This is my 4th HDTV, I've had Sony and Sharp LCDs, and a Panasonic Plasma. All I can say is that this Elite TV is TRULY an ELITE TV!. I did all the research I could, auditioned it, went back and forth between this and the Pioneer basic version 5020... and finally got a good deal and pulled the trigger.. After I brought it home, I COULD NOT believe how great it looks on and off. First night I watched Underworld Evolution and Spiderman3 in HDTV (1080i), the details I saw in this TV, I HAVE NEVER EVER seen before. All I could say was WOW!!! I watched movies until 4am cause I just couldn't turn it off.. The other big shock was how GREAT this is under daylight situations! Unlke some other Plasmas and new LED LCDs shiny screens, this TV anti-glare is incredible, I got all windows adjusant to the left of this TV and at first was keeping my blinds closed to reduce reflection, then I tried them with blinds open and WOW, I couldn't believe how well it looked. Blinds are open now.. All I can say is that this TV is worth EVERY PENNY. It sure is fairly expensive compared to other similarly sized TVs, BUT, it is like comparing a Home-theatre in a box system to a dedicated HiFi system, they both may do 7-channel 100watts, but the quality of the sound isn't comparable. Do not compare this TV in bright lights in a store compared to VIVID LCD setups, they may look brighter, or give an impression of details with extra manufatured sharpness, but those are NOT part of the original picture.... If you are looking to have a TV that looks almost like what you see in a THX Movie Theatre, then THIS IS THE TV!. To sumarize, if you can find this set anywhere, GET ONE! They are almost all gone, you will NOT find a better TV at any price range... believe me, I've looked!. 

$$;
Pros:. Best picture quality available for 1080 sources. Delivers accurate color and blacks that are truly black. A handful of cool, usable features.. 
Cons:. Scaling of non-1080 sources isn't great. Brightness uniformity in dark scenes isn't perfect. Runs hot and greedily slurps electricity, despite "green" stickers.. 
Summary:. Though it isn't quite "The Perfect TV" some make out, its fair to say that without any qualifications the Pro-111fd is the best HDTV currently available and probably will remain so for some time. It delivers a direct-view picture quality unlikely to be soon surpassed by other plasma manufacturers or the current crop of competing technologies (LCD and, um, Mitsu's Laser Beams). It looks good and has superior build quality to most other options. Menus look good and are fairly useful though it can take a number of clicks to get to picture settings in the menus. The DNLA streaming functions work, but are a bit spartan in usability terms.. With a 1080i/p source, the picture is flawless. The internal scaling leaves 720p material looking a bit flabby to my eye. Color can be surprisingly realistic, but isn't perfect out of the box, even using the Pure setting. Brightness uniformity on my set wasn't perfect - I get a brighter bottom edge of the screen regardless of settings on any primarily dark image - but has improved over time. The picture changes noticeably over the first couple hundred hours of use but really settles in beautifully after a "break-in" period of 500 hours or so. The absolute best in the display can be brought out with a visit from a professional calibrator at this point in time, but can be dialed in satisfactorily with a Google search and a bit of tweaking.. Due to wariness about burn-in, the use of non-linear stretch mode for 4:3 SD content seems to be encouraged in the settings menus but this means SD picture quality tends to suffer noticeably. I prefer the older Faroudja-based processing in my receiver to perform linear stretch of SD content. For DVD, I have the Reon-based Denon 2930 which offers superior deinterlacing/scaling to the internal processing. The pure cinema advanced de-interlacing mode seeks to restore the original 24Hz frame-rate of film-based content with mixed results. This only works as a deinterlacing mode so I will sometimes compromise and send 1080i to the display to with watchable results but don't expect anything comparable to a native 24 Hz source. Also worth noting for us former ex-pats, this display can display PAL video at the native 25Hz frame-rate.. Despite a couple shortcomings, I wouldn't consider replacing this display with any other direct view set. In conjunction with my 2930, DVDs look as good as I've ever seen. Watching well-transferred films on blu-ray, this display is capable of delivering a picture that is nothing short of stunning.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best picture quality and color acuracy. Great display of dark scenes makes Pioneer the best brand for the Plasma TV. I recommend you check out http://www.squidoo.com/best-hdtv for information what best and cheapest HDTV to buy for 2009.. 
Cons:. No compliant for this plasma TV.. 
Summary:. I would recommend Pioneer plasma TV for everyone..

Summary:. As an electronics sales I give it a five star for improving on the ability for the day and night time viewing.. Updated. on Apr 22, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. The best plasma that I know. Perfect graphic and sound. Great for blu-ray movie and gaming at 1080P full high-definition. Also, I recommend you to check out http://www.squidoo.com/best-hdtv for the updated information on the best and cheapest HDTV.. 
Cons:. I can't think of one.. 
Summary:. I recommend this HDTV to everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. WAY TOO MANY TO DO IN 250 characters or less.... Excellent Picture, Excellent aesthetics, PURE MODE give excellent picture quality, 1080p 72 Hz gives Blu Ray the best picture I've ever seen.. 
Cons:. Standard Definition is so so at best, but who cares when the rest of the picture is in the words of RHINO FULLY AWESOME!. 
Summary:. I was able to get this TV on sale which make the purchase even sweeter. This TV is and will be amongst the best TV on the market even after Pioneer stops making them. When paired with and Elite Blu-Ray player and an Elite A/V receiver, there is just an absolute harmony in equipment... I have it with a BDP-05FD and VSX03-TXH Elite Receiver and I most say that I will have some of the best movie viewing for years to come.. I do not use the speakers for this TV because honestly why would anyone buy this beauty and NOT have a surround system to go with&gt;&gt;?????. This is simply the best purchase I've made and it will continue to be for years to come.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very acccurate color, extremely deep blacks, thin profile (larger LCDs actualy look fatter than plasmas of the same size to me).. 
Cons:. None (well it was either output at component or HDMI).. 
Summary:. I don't own this TV, but I saw it in Best Buy for around $2000 and the picture blew me away. I wonder if the Sony XEl-1 produces a deeper shade of blank than this TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Black levels, shadow details, blu-ray performance, 1080p upscaling, pro adjustability, color accuracy, ISF mode accessibility. 
Cons:. cost, weight, To see Pioneer leaving the plasma business (well not really a con). 
Summary:. This is an absolutely amazing plasma, my first plasma and very happy with black levels, color accuracy and pro adjustment options. I am coming from Sony XBR2 so used to have bright, vivid viewing habit but after getting Elite Kuro PRO-111FD I realized that color accuracy, shadow detail is way more important over that torchy bright LCD. I like the amazing black levels but that is not THE reason, I considered and researched Panasonic TH-58PZ850U, Sony KDL-52XBR6 and Samsung LN-52A650 but thought Pioneer is well worth the money I paid little over 3500 back in December 2008 and worth every penny. Looking forward to getting it professionally calibrated in near future..

$$;
Pros:. This has to be one of the best HDTV's I have ever used. The picture quality is amazing when watching The Dark Knight and Iron Man. The Kuro itself is slick looking and attractive. The Connectivity is great with a lot of HDMI connections.. 
Cons:. Cost Way to much for just a HDTV. The standard definition quality is not that great but it is exceptable.. 
Summary:. If you want a great HDTV, this is the way to go. It produces AWESOME picture quality on DVD's and Blu-Ray movies. It comes in great value, but the price will have you scrathing your head. But overall, Its a great HDTV that everyone should consider buying. You will not be dissapointed!. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent picture. 
Cons:. bit bulky.. 
Summary:. Too bad it may not fit down the chimney. 

$$;
Pros:. Black levels exemplary, split screen very useful with HDMI input. Stunning overall picture quality,. 
Cons:. Where did the TV guide and cable card slot go???. 
Summary:. I own a PRO-1150HD, the 2007 720p model. With that unit, I can plug in a cable card provided by the cable company and receive HD programming, without an additional box taking up an already crowded cabinet. The TV guide, although it only lists SD and off-air HD progams, is very useful. Last year's 1080p PRO-110HD also had the TV guide and CC slot, but the newer 111 does not. Why should I have to give up those features, which my wife loves, to get the better black levels of the new model? Pioneer giveth, but Pioneer also taketh away.... 

$$;
Pros:. There is a difference between the Pioneer Elite TVs and Non-Elites. Believe me, for the extra money, I carefully compared them side by side with the same content in my living room.. 
Cons:. The price was high, but if you shop carefully, price match, and deal, you can save a lot of money. Some online retailers are not authorized Pioneer dealers, thereby void the warranty (I could not confirm this, however).. 
Summary:. Simply put this TV has the best, truest picture available today in it's size. In the process of settling on the PRO-111, I returned a Samsung 120 hz LCD because it made the image look 3D -- but video-like and "animated," and a pioneer non-Elite (PDP-5020) because it could not render as detailed a picture as the PRO-111. As CNET's review indicates, this TV is outstanding. The PURE mode provides an excellent, accurate picture out of the box (and CNET's calibration tweaks are helpful). BTW, I also have the 42" Elite PRO-950hd in my bedroom, and it is an unbelievalbe TV --the only one TV that slightly beats the PRO-111 for the a 3D image, because of the smaller screen (even though it's only 720p). Friends are amazed when they see it. It was discontinued by Pioneer, but you can still find it at some retailers. Deal on the price of both these TVs! Good luck! Happy viewing!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent black level, color reproduction, contrast, etc.. 
Cons:. Price, I did get mine on sale though for 3999 from Best Buy. Its 4999 now.. 
Summary:. I have this TV for almost 2 months now and absolutely love it. Prior to this I had the Sony 52XBR4 which is no slouch but the Kuro is better in all areas. For those complaning about blurring, this TV or any TV for that matter is dependent on the signal its receiving. So if your cable provider is compressing the siginal it will look crappy. Get a blu ray player and watch a movie like speed racer with the settings on the cnet review and I guarantee you will be blown away. 

$$;
Pros:. Jaw dropping picture-clean, smooth, virtually artifact free.the best blacks I've EVER seen. DVD looks great, easy menu that doesn't get in the way, complete picture adjustment. Correct color. top notch build quality, decent remote(metal parts!). 
Cons:. Cant seem to find "variable audio output". Silly, but its a big miss for us who haven't moved to digital cable yet. I'm scared of scratching the perfect piano black finish.. 
Summary:. I bought this yesterday and with very little adjustment the picture is staggering. Ive sold Runco (and been to Runco school) and it wasn't this good, i bet they use these panels. If your a videophile you could buy this sight unseen and be totally happy-that's super rare. Thanks cnet for the info. I bought the Panasonic 55 blu-ray on your recc too(wont have it till nov :( ). Cant wait to get home and enjoy it. Money well spent!!. 

$$;
Pros:. This is a hobby for me. I get a new set every 2-3 years. I have had 5 sets mostly LCD. This set deserves a ten. Deep blacks change everything! The colors are truer, brighter and cleaner. The dark areas have clarity and detail. I remain amazed !. 
Cons:. None worth every penny. 
Summary:. Go out and buy it - you will enjoy every moment!. 

$$;
Pros:. The Gen9 Kuro is simply stunning. The black levels produce eye popping contrast and an incredible color palette. I am quite pleased with mine, and finally have the digital tv that lives up to the promise.. 
Cons:. So far, nothing. Expensive by today's standards, but I paid more for a Mits WS65813 a few years ago.. 
Summary:. Pioneer has produced an extraoridinary plasma television. Some are misinformed regarding their future, but Pioneer is not getting out of the plasma business. They are going to source panels from Panasonic with next year's Gen10 product, but the secret to the Kuro performance is practically all in their proprietary video engine, processing, and filter technologies that they will be bolting on to the Pana glass.. If you want the BMW of televisions, this is the only option.. Updated. on Jan 2, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful colors and blacks. Great contrast. Gorgeous piano black finish. 
Cons:. Expensive (you have to be nuts to want to spend double the price for a 15-25% image improvement, but I guess I'm nuts). 
Summary:. I bought this TV last June, and I've loved every minute with it. It produces a near-3D image, and I love the picture controls. I use Pure mode with a few tweaks, although I'm thinking about having it professionally calibrated. The Pioneer Elites have an ISFccc calibration scheme which produces an even BETTER picture (if that's possible).. I do agree with the CNET review that it produces only an average standard definition picture, though. However, that might just be because its high definition picture is so good. I've found myself watching more and more high definition programming and less standard definition television, though.. Oh, and Blu-rays are killer on the 111. I finished watching The Lost Boys the other night, and I felt like I was in Santa Cruz!. 

$$;
Pros:. All about the black baby. 
Cons:. too bad this is the end of the line. you've got only 1% of the population ponying up the big bucks for these things. pioneer out of the plasma business now.. 
Summary:. if you can afford it, buy the 60", a PS3, and a tricked out home theatre system. AWESOME.. 

$$;
Pros:. Superb picture detail, incredible accuracy and the deep blacks and perfect whites all combine to produce as perfect a picture as current technology permits. Everything simply looks better on this set. I never need to go near a movie theater again.. 
Cons:. It's really too expensive and I has several totally useless features in my opinion: the speakers (who would buy a set at this price and not have a good surround sound system?) and the light and color sensors which only mess with the picture quality.. 
Summary:. I own the big brother of the Cnet-reviewed 111FD (the 151FD). I also have a Panasonic 800U, which is a very good set, but when you see the same material on both sets you will not know immediately why the Panasonic is only very good and the Pioneer is in a different league. Watching a movie on this set from Blu-Ray is beter than in a movie theater in all respects but sheer screen size because of the incredible color fidelity and contrast range. Watching a standard DVD on a decent player is almost as good. Cable HD looks better than I have ever seen it.. Being a real film buff, I can also say that this set does one thing I have never seen any other TV do. It makes classic black and white films look as spectacular as they can. The incredible blacks, the dark scene detail, and the range of grays and whites makes watching film noir a totally new experience. If your tastes in movies is not just limited to the latest color spectaculars, you have to see this set in action.. Essentially perfect color and black and white too. I'm in heaven.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great, vivid, accurate pictures, the best black level showed the difference on the fireworks when watching the Beijing Olympic Games. I feel my eyes are more comfortable than watching any other TVs for a long time at a close distance.. 
Cons:. Speakers are not the best although it's quite good.. 
Summary:. I have purchased this TV more than a month now, and still love the fact I made a right choice to choose the best TV available on the market. Even though the price is much higher than Panasonic, I think I paid it for what I waited for. CNet has a great score for the new Panasonic, I disagree with the editor. I watched the TVs side by side at Best Buy, Pioneer clearly showed the best detail. Watching an TV anchor with a black suite, Pioneer showed the collar and light gray stripes, while Panasonic only shows the suite was black and cannot tell the collar shape from the rest of the suite nor the light gray stripes. Another difference is the face color. Pioneer showed the most natural face color than any other TVs at Best Buy. The third point is about the screen reflection on ambient light. Flash a lighter in front of the screen, you will see Pioneer has one singer reflection of your light while Panasonic reflects 3 reflections (two mores because of the way it's made). This mean Panasonic will have more reflection lights when you watch TV during daylight or more ambient lights. I used to be a Panasonic fan, but now I have to switch to Pioneer. Go to the store and compare yourself.. 

$$;
Pros:. super rich blacks, incredible depth. 
Cons:. I may never leave my living room again. 
Summary:. I've had this TV for two days now. I was a little late to jump on the hi-def band wagon and once I was finally ready to do it, someone advised me to wait for this set to come out. I'm glad I did, I've seen many other hi-def sets and most of them are pretty good but this one surpasses anything I've seen elsewhere. The blacks are so rich and the definition so strong it's just something you have too see for yourself. I've heard about how Pioneer has been doing side by side comparisons of this set with other models. I like to think of it as a current day Pepsi challenge. I suggest you take it and see for yourself.. 

$$;
Pros:. Black levels still the best in the biz; great AR coating; simple, tasteful styling; ISF Day and Night modes are incredible. 
Cons:. Standard def is a little poor on this set. 
Summary:. Almost perfection and still head-and-shoulders above the competition years after it's release.. 

$$;
Pros:. All the bells and whistles,Best picture quality ever,Lots of control,2yr warrenty,and can hook up a sub woofer without a home theater system. 
Cons:. Price(but it is only money). 
Summary:. this is the last tv i should ever have to buy .it is fun to look at even when it is off, and I cant wait to hook up the x box 360.Also, the super bowl was viewed as never before.Just "awesome". 

$$;
Pros:. Inky Blacks and accurate colors.. 
Cons:. A lot of noise comes from the TV.. 
Summary:. Awesome TV but my only question is the noise coming from the TV. I sit a good 10 feet away from the TV and can still here it humming. Has anyone had this problem or is it "normal" in these type of TV's? My dealer is looking into it but I wanted to know if anyone else was having the same problem?. Updated. on Feb 2, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. It has the best picture I have ever seen on an HDTV. It is not as bright as a LCD, however, much more realistic. I will never have anything except a plasma.. 
Cons:. The only thing I don't like is that when you are watching a channel that is not full screen the side bars sometimes change to gray when I like black better. This could be a problem just with my set.. 
Summary:. This TV has plenty of HDMI connections and the remote is very easy to operate. If it wasn't for the side bars not staying black all the time I would have rated this a full five stars. I have had Samsung, Toshiba and Sony HDTV's and I can say I will never own anything except a Pioneer until the others catch up.. 

$$;
Pros:. Black blacks, great contrast, vibrant colors. 
Cons:. reflective frame is distracting, screen can be to dark at times make it difficult to see faces in shadows. 
Summary:. Phenomenal tv, but I am not sure it is twice as good as a TV offered at half the price. 

$$;
Pros:. The best fast action, realistic, color optimized set I have ever seen. 
Cons:. speakers are best at the bottom of the set rather than the side. Price? Debatable,. 
Summary:. I was truly stuck on deciding between the XBR8 and the Elite. I'd watch the XBR in store #1 and be prepared to write a cheque. Then i'd go to store #2 and watch the Pioneer, and of course be ready to write a cheque. THEN, I found a store which carried both, with an almost side by side comparison, where I could actually see the difference between the two sets. At this price, a side by side is mandatory even if i'd been an XBR fan for two decades. Subjectively, they're both incredible by delivering the best that either technology has to offer as of todays date. When viewing a satellite fed movie, the Pioneer drew me closer in with its warmer, almost spooky realism to colour (especially skin tones) and almost 3-D like rendering. The Sony was incredible, but to my eye, not quite as good. Then we watched a series of competitors motorbike jumping outdoors, and owning an XBR LCD I was quite aware of the limitations with my set as it related to "fast movement". On the XBR8, it was difficult to tell the difference with the Pioneer no matter how hard i looked. Damn... this was getting ridiculous. Then, being the affable snow creature from the great white North, something close to my heart was tuned in on the satellite.... a hockey game! I resisted the temptation to light up a players and crack a molson, and sat down to make what was to be my final decision. Colour, ambiance, warmth, realism, 3-D effect, and especially the fast movement and detail I experienced with the Pioneer won me over. In my opinion, the Pioneer outshone the XBR in all categories that i feel are important to great TV entertainment. this is not to say the XBR was bad, it just took a side by side comparison to show the true superiority of Pioneer. Blue ray was scary on both, but again, the warmth of the Pioneer made me want to sit down and watch movies all freakin day, much to the dismay of the salesperson who'd thought I would never leave ...... but i did ...... AND I wrote a cheque for the Pioneer. if you have a discerning eye, and you feel the kids college fund is just not that important, buy this set knowing its probably the best there is out there ... today.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful 1080p reception with Blue Ray 95% of the time. Deep blacks. Very accurate colors. Capable jutter correction under the appropriate settings. Extraordinary. Nothing else I've looked at approaches its performance.. 
Cons:. Limited trouble with high def TV/Satellite reception. Some channels exhibit a moire artifact, leaving the impression of looking through venetian blinds. This artifact is not present in BluRay with the appropriate firmware, or in XBox game play.. 
Summary:. I have observed a fleeting-to-noticeable moire artifact on several high definition channels, and a prominent moire artifact on TNT HD. When the camera jump-cuts, pans or zooms the artifact leaves an impression of looking through Venetian blinds . I spoke to several Pioneer tech reps about the problem and one told me Pioneer is aware of this issue; they refer to the moire pattern under the above described conditions as a "known artifact". I was not told what Pioneer plans to do about it but they have noticed (again according to the rep) that all or most of their plasmas exhibit a moire artifact to varying degrees.. The reps speculate that the source of the problem may rest in part with the broadcast signal, the other part sourced to their plasmas. I do not know how this characteristic compares to other plasmas on the market. (Side note: I also observed the artifact approach the level of a serious distortion when playing BluRay discs on the Pioneer BDP 05 FD before the 1.17 firmware upgrade. I hasten to point out that I have not observed the artifact on BluRay in any degree since the upgrade was installed.). I will close with a minor caveat. My standards are rather high, and I do not think the general public will catch any but the most striking examples of this "known artifact". My advice? For what its worth, when assessing whether or not this artifact will become an irreconcilable viewing issue for any customer, customers contemplating a Pioneer purchase should ask their sales persons to connect the plasma they are interested in to recent episodes of "Law and Order" or "Missing" on TNT HD. The customer might then compare that image to other makes and models tuned to the same program.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing picture great price. 
Cons:. Screen gets really hot, 1080i resolution isn't the greatest, "but when is it ever?" No yahoo widgets or ipod connectivity to T.V.. 
Summary:. This is the best television to buy for a home theater system bar none. And with pioneer going out of the television business the prices on these things are amazing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding picture quality in the Performance and Sports mode. 
Cons:. Pure mode isn't as sharp as I expected for an HD set. The picture can be adjusted to solve issues with lack of brightness or dark faces, but it takes more juice to do so. This t.v. gets pretty hot if you set it for plenty of brightness and color.. 
Summary:. Great t.v. overall. I was disappointed in the amount of brightness in the Performance mode at factory default, but switching to the Sports mode solved that, especially for viewing sports programs. While this made the t.v. run hotter, the screen can easily be changed back to the Performance mode for viewing normal programming, which doesn't need as much brightness or sharpness, and thus allows the t.v. to run a little cooler.. No blurriness was encountered with fast moving hockey action.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great HD quality viewing with Blu-Ray, PS3, and Xbox games.. 
Cons:. DVDs just OK, SD/HD (over the air) looks bad.. 
Summary:. I bought this TV (151FD-60") for Black-Friday. I was using a Sony XBR950 LCD 60". HD input blew me away...Blu-Ray (via PS3-HDMI) looked amazing! Video games (Xbox/PS3 via HDMI) looked amazing as well. However, HD/SD channels via HDTV antenna (OTA) looked bad. I did notice some bluring when watching the weekend football games, but the color and details were better then my LCD.. The controls are easy to use, and you can tweak the picture/color to your liking. The TV was very easy to hook up to my home network and could see my computer right away. You can name inputs, and have different settings for each (movie, game, etc).. Bottom line: If you watch a lot of SD/HD over the air programs and older DVDs, this TV may not be for you. If you watch HD video (Blu-Ray HD-DVD) this TV will blow you away. I still like the way my Sony processes SD TV, but I never saw a more defined picture in HD as I did on this TV. Most people might want to consider the other HDTV models (Panasonic/LG/Samsung) CNET mentions for better pricing.. 

$$;
Pros:. True blacks, DLNA.. 
Cons:. Too dark overalll, poor video processing engine for the money. Inner border around screen surface is very reflective, and thus annoying. No side input for HDMI (PC).. 
Summary:. Have owned for 6 months now. I A-B tested this against my old Chinese made plasma of 1/3 the cost. Apart from the colour temp, there was not a huge difference. Pioneer has good black but does not shade them properly, so when playing dark scenes in movies/games it is pretty much just black holes. I should not have to start to white out the black to get detail. Also combing and panning onscreen is unacceptable at this price point. My old plasma performed just as poorly. This was with good source content, ie James Bond. And if an old cheap TV performs similar then the Pioneer is a lot of hype. Content from FTA in Australia is 576i or 1080i, this TV may only shine with Blu-ray, I have not yet tested.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture is very nice on HD channels. 
Cons:. It wasn't worth what we paid for it. The non-HD channels looked grainy and of poor quality.. 
Summary:. We paid $3650 for this TV in December to put in our family room, then last month we decided to replace the big tv in our living room, so we looked around and found a comparable 1080p plasma hdtv for half the price that we like a lot more. It was a Hitachi 50" Plasma 1080P HDTV ( http://www.gobuysave.com/televisions/p50v702.html ). We're now wishing we found that deal in December and we'd have an extra $2,000 in our pockets.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture is a bit better than the Panasonic 800 but its hard to tell since the guy in the store said it was pro calibrated.. 
Cons:. Its just not worth the money, you can buy a panasonic for half the price. The Pio does not deliver twice the picture, this is just a small difference for a lot of $$. 
Summary:. If you got lots of cash to spend this is your TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have the new plasma pioneer and it is a wonderful TV and nobody will disagree about this issue, the color is realy deep and intense, the picture is simply wonderful but there is a BIG BIG BUT. 
Cons:. BLURRING PROBLEMS AGAIN AND AGAIN. I was so excited when i buy this Pioneer Plasma TV and the first thing is said to my self, finaly the tennis game picture will be clear and wonderful, and that was true when the player has not serving any ball yet.. 
Summary:. Tthe blurring problem that appear on fast action like Football game, Hockey game and even on a tennis games is TOTALY TRUE. Beleive me how difficult to accept this problem when you spend this kind of money on a TV like Plasma Pioneer !!!!, the reviews is always turning around the same points and it is : Deep blackness and intense color but they never mention anything about the blurring problem !!!. That prove one thing that the technology either on LCD or Plasma is still not accurate and the professional reviewers should try to watch a football or a hockey game for an hour and then they should tell the whole story, not just the deep black and the colors etc etc.....So please stop blaming the other reviewer who had mention the blurring problem, he is totaly right and becareful not to spend this big money on a technologie that yet is not able to eliminate this problem unless you don't care at all about any sport game !!!. 

$$;
Pros:. It is true that Pioneer Kuro televisions offer great black, good color and depth perception.. 
Cons:. Before buying a Pioneer Plasma TV I read many reviews (including CNET'S) which said the color qualities where really good but it was also mentioned in several forums that Pioneer's service was poor in the US. In Canada the service is no better !. 
Summary:. At the store, in Canada, where I purchased the TV, I asked about the quality of the service Canada vs the US and they assured me it was excellent in Canada. My TV literally blew up after less than 2 months of ownership and I asked for a new units since I judged this unit too new to fix and because of the unknown and potential impact on the other components. I am still waiting for my TV to be serviced and if I bought a large TV it is to enjoy it. Now I do not even have a TV and to have one temporarily, the store (Centre HiFi in Canada) said I had to buy another one which they would refund. I just spent several thousands and they think I will put out more money. No way, I want my TV back! All in all I am not happy with Pioneer so be forewarned about the service because It would appear I am not the only one complaining.. An important part of any product is the quality of the service, specially higher price products. This is very important if service becomes an issue. I am rather upset about the choice I made. As far as I am concerned I am not a happy Pioneer customer. I don?t care how good the image was, etc.. Updated. on Oct 25, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice color, contrast, and clarity.. 
Cons:. In HD football game every close-up fast movement shot - jersey numbers &#38; body movement became blurred and broken up. If this is the new $4000 dollar technology I'll stick with my non-HD projection TV. Great picture &#38; no blurring &#38; video break. 
Summary:. I've viewed large screen plasma and LCD TVs critically and at length and sure, the picture has nice color and definition, but they all suffer from the same glaring defect - inability to accurately reproduce tight quick action shots. A football game is a good test. I don't understand how people can rave about a product that blurs and breaks up closeup fast action shots such as quick arm and leg movement and jersey numbers when a player is tackled. In that regard, this very expensive Pioneer plasma HD TV is no better than lower priced HD TVs. Personally, I will stick with my non-HD 52" TV with great picture and no blurring or breakups until technology can produce a plasma or LCD TV picture that is smooth and clear no matter how fast the action is..

$$;
Pros:. None...ok.. Looks nice. 
Cons:. My Pioneer plasma lasted only 18 months, when I contacted Pioneer I was told " sorry, out of warranty ". 
Summary:. The only thing " High End ' about Pioneer Plasma's are the price....don't waste your money...I would NEVER purchase another Pioneer product.
