0 out of 5 stars Significant improvements to ergonomics and navigation, February 24, 2009
I find navigating the device page turns, menus, etc .
I couldn't imagine trying to navigate internet pages without it .
There are several on, screen navigation improvements due to faster e, ink :
I also found using the navigation button difficult .
There is a new 5, way navigation toggle for left, right, up, down plus  press  .
There can be occassional minor  ghosting  problems where the screen does not completely update on a page turn or when navigating .
The Kindle 1 roller button and quirky silver navigation bar are gone .
Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .
Losing the side cursor gives Kindle 2 a cleaner look ,  but it's the greatly improved navigation that's the real benefit .
I have some more to learn about searching and navigating, but if an old geezer like me can do it, anybody can .
The thumb stick navigation on the Kindle takes some getting used to, especially those who use touch screens or mice everyday .
