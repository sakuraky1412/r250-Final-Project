i have the 50 set hooked up to a 7  .
1 surround system with just a little light in the room at night  .
it is an awesome experience  .
during the day i have a window    wall with no curtains  .
there is virtually no noticeable glare  .
i'm sad their discontinuing this line some nights , i stand four feet in front of the screen , just gazing at the image  .
i feel i could just reach out and touch it  .
who could ask for more .
i have had many different hdtv's and this is the best by far  .
i just used the new hd digital video essentials to calibrate this tv  .
this tv kills my panasonic plasma and sharp lcd  .
it is also much better than the samsung plasma that i returned  .
buy it if you can  .
you will not be sorry  .
i must also add that this tv does standard definition better than any hdtv i have seen  .
good job pioneer on the build , and cnet on the review  .
after spending the better part of an hour scrutinizing and comparing side    by    side displays of the pioneer pdp    5080hd with 720p and the pioneer 50 inch model with 1080p , i can honestly say that neither i , nor the other people viewing along with me , could see any difference whatsoever in the color , color depth , or sharpness between these two models  .
everything about the 5080hd is excellent and , considering the good price i paid for mine , this hdtv is well super    excellent early on in my quest for a good hdtv i did have some reservations about buying 720p instead of the more recent 1080p  .
but most articles i've researched on this matter conclude the higher resolution 1080p format is most effective on screens 55 inches and larger  .
any difference on smaller screens hardly matters when viewed from more than 6 feet so , considering all the wonderful qualities of pioneer products , i could only come to one conclusion   buy  .
i did  .
i'm happy  .
i've had thid tv for 2 months , i spent alot of time comparing this to the latest samies and sonies , the pioneer 5080 has better blacks , much less glare , better viewing angles , and better price  .
to name but a few  .
glad i choose the pioneer  .
if you want a screen no larger than 50 and your viewing distance is greater than 6' , this is the 'steal of the century'  .
pioneer dropped their price on this 720p pdp5080hd kuro set by $500 in late december  .
i purchased from pioneer authorized online dealer , www  .
invisiondisplays  .
com for $2000 which included delivery and no tax  .
the folks at invision are exceptional  .
it's a family run business with very knowledgeable people , and they also have a storefront in washington  .
i am most impressed with their professionalism , sense of humor and knowledge  .
in addition to pioneer's one    year warranty , i got the extra 5 yr  .
in    home parts labor warranty for $299 through invision  .
that's only $60/yr  .
the tv is ready for delivery a week ahead of schedule , and arrived shrink    wrapped on its' own pallet in the upright position , as recommended on the outside of the carton i've compared this pioneer 720p to 1080p plasmas and lcds from samsung , panasonic and sony , side    by    side , at best buy and there is no comparison  .
pioneer does it right with the sum of its' parts creating a superior product and picture  .
do not think twice , and get this incredible tv from invision displays now  .
i also advise protecting this great tv with a furman sound pts    8 surge protector that is like no other , as it improves video and audio as well  .
i've actually tried it on the accuphase cd player ($10 , 000 in 1996) in my high    end audio system and the improvement is worth 5 times the $135 price as other users have advised , and pioneer substantiates , it is wise to play this tv in the 'movie' mode for the initial 200 hours prior to using the 'optimum' setting  .
while the tv has great technology to prevent burn    in , pioneer also suggests running a simple program to clear any potential burn    in from static images  .
at the end of the day , on the remote control , press the 'home' button , option button , and scroll down to video pattern , then press 'enter' , and a white noise program    wipe will eliminate any potential burn    in images  .
the program runs for one hour and then shuts off the tv automatically  .
there's a reason pioneer costs a little bit more  .
it's worth it  .
but this 720p is a steal .
i researched 50 plasmas for many months determined that from my perspective , the pioneer 5080hd is hands    down the best picture available vs  .
comparable panasonic plamsas numerous lcd models  .
i patiently    waited on prices to fall on this model they finally did substantially just around christmas (from $3 , 499 retail at best buy to $2 , 499)  .
best buy has now offered it as low as $2 , 249 other online sellers have reduced their prices in similar fashion  .
at this price , it is only $500 or so above other 50 720p models , the picture difference is well worth that small differential  .
as others have repeated , the blacks therefore contrast/sharpness are unmatched  .
there is no discernible difference at all at normal viewing distances between this 720p model similarly or higher    priced 1080p models from competitors  .
set    up operation were easily understood mastered by a non    tekkie  .
with the prevailing prices for this model , there is no reason to settle for anything less than the finest picture on the market for just a few dollars more than the pretenders .
i've had the set for six weeks and i'm amazed each time i see the depth of the picture the experience is really inexpressible so seeing the pioneer 5080hd is worth more then a thousand words could say .
pdp    5080 is #1 for a reason  .
we went from a 36inch box tv to this hd plasma and flt we went from 3rd world to out of this world  .
buy this set  .
i priced around and found that beachcamera had the lowest price and is authorized pioneer dealor  .
they beat best buy  .
everyone has this for sale at 3499  .
00 , i paid 2 , 450 inc shipping and delivery  .
fyi    just make sure you buy from an authorized pioneer dealor .
the best picture i've ever seen  .
the sound quality is very good .
i got this tv a few days ago  .
my family is very pleased with it so far  .
i bought the toshiba hd    dvd player (hda2) simultaneously and is able to watch a movie in about 25 minutes after the setup  .
the thing that took the longest is taking the tv out of the package and screwing in of the speaker brackets  .
the picture is outstanding  .
the blacks are true and the other colors follow suit  .
we cannot go back to the old 20 inch crt and we wonder how we ever watched anything on it  .
at 50 inches this size is perfect for 2 bedroom apartment living rooms here in san diego  .
i'm only about 8    10 feet away from the screen  .
do not worry about it being 720p native resolution , 1080p sources look amazing  .
besides the hd    dvd player (via hdmi) , i have a ps3 (via hdmi) and a wii (via component cables) hoooked up  .
hd    dvds , sd dvds , blue    ray , and the games look amazing on this tv  .
the speaker itself sounds remarkebly good  .
i am still waiting to get hooked up to time warner cable (i just moved to a new apartment the day i got the tv) but from just watching a few hd channels via antenna i know cable will look good  .
sd tv over the antenna looked adequate considering the crappy signal  .
i have not tried pc hookup yet  .
this tv is a better value than a smaller sony bravia xbr3 , 4 , or 5 lcd 1080p and a better performer .
do not regret the purchase for a minute  .
cannot imagine not having it now ; wish my computer monitor is plasma .
this is my first hd television and i did a lot of research prior to purchasing it  .
the features that really made it for me were the crisp brilliant pictures  .
i watch a lot of sports and there is never any ghosting or pixilation on fast moving screens  .
most people who come over and see my television often comment on how this television looks better than those they have or have seen in other places  .
overall a great choice although you must pay a premium .
i have been completely satisfied with my pdp    5080 hd  .
excellent picture quality  .
menus could be improved , but are not a problem to navigate  .
options are good  .
my viewing distance is about 8 feet , at which distance my old eyes cannot distinguish 1080p from 720p ; god knows , i've tried  .
so the 720p is perfectly satisfactory for me  .
some may require the 1080p and should look elsewhere also , i got this on clearance that's why i do not buy bleeding edge equipment  .
the new models are out for those who wish to pay full price .
after months of exhaustive research and several visits to different retail    stores , i purchased my pioneer kuro pdp    5080 hd on    line from vann's in september , 2007  .
now , 8 months of viewing later , i am , if anything , even more delighted with this magnificent hdtv than when i first got it  .
this is especially so when i compare it's picture quality to other brands and types of hdtv's belonging to friends and relatives  .
yes , some of the newer models from major competitors are almost as good picture    wise , but many truly pale by comparison  .
and imo , none are nearly as handsome in styling .
this is my first hd tv that i bought  .
the 50 inch kuros had great reviews here at cnet , so i saved up my cash to buy the ultimate tv  .
and yes , it is ultimate plasma  .
for gaming is perfect , do you have any idea how beautiful my ps3 games look on that tv  .
and yes i do not regret the purchase but , after all the praises i do admit that the piano cover is kinda lame , it got scratched the first day i touched it  .
and customer support has a lot to desire , specially considering the high price , although i bought it at a fantastic price other than that , pioneer has done a fantastic job on this tv , and i love it forever .
after months of research and comparison shopping , i decided to go with the 5080hd  .
what a great decision  .
the anti    glare screen almost completely eliminates the problem of the mirror    like images that some plasmas were/are known for  .
the blacks are so black that the picture seems to jump out at you and the other colors are so accurate that it creates very realistic images  .
although it is difficult to watch sd programming after seeing the high def images , the programs broadcast in 480i look much better than most other televisions , lcd or plasma , that i have seen  .
i tried to like the panasonic or the samsung enough so i would not have to spend the extra money for the pioneer but in the end , quality won out  .
if you get this set , you will not be disappointed .
i have little technical knowledge of tv's  .
i am strictly a consumer and i can only judge this tv from it main purpose which is viewing  .
this is the best picture quality i have ever seen  .
it continues to impress me even after 2 months  .
friends that bought lcd's are now looking to upgrade to pioneer  .
sports , especially hockey , are great , no motion blur i have had absolutely no image retention after 2 months and i have not bothered with all the recommended break in tips other than engaging the orbiter and the auto screen size selector the only issue i have is that the auto screen size selector seems to drop off from time to time requiring manual selection to avoid side bars  .
it could be my hd box causing it but i have not solved it yet one other downside is the hd picture quality is so good i cannot stand watching sd channels any more this tv is the only material object that has ever exceeded my expections .
compared several flat screens side by side (plazma and lcd)  .
even compared it side by side to the 1080p models with the same feed from a bd player and i could not see any diference in picture quality  .
the 2 final models that were in my mind were the panasonic 750 and the pioneer 5080 and the i decided on the pioneer because of its performance and its price (could not beat teh $1999 deal that is offered by best buy  .
in fact i also got the 50 and 42 models and i exchanged the 42 for the 50 .
bought this tv after 1year of researching , afraid to pull the trigger because i was not sure which brand of plasma or lcd to buy  .
this model , the 5080hd stood out all along but couldn't justify the price difference over other brands that had a great picture too  .
when i found this model on sale at a local brick and mortar store for $700  .
00 less than they normally is selling it for i jumped on it and have not been sorry  .
what a picture  .
cnet is right in their review  .
if you're looking for an awesome picture , the 5080hd definitely has it  .
when doing a side    by    side comparison , this tv stands out    even against 1080p models  .
the biggest difference is a darker black which makes every other color stand out even more  .
i would go head to head with any tv out there , and this tv would hold it own .
after reading reviews and setting one of these up for a friend i am pleased to say i agree with all the reviews  .
most people bashing the set on here are pro panasonic people , and i like panasonic plasmas as well , but this 720p set looked just as good as most of the panasonic 1080p sets i is going to buy  .
out of the box this set is very good , needs some tweaking , reds need to be toned down a bit but over all picture quality on directv hd and regular cable and blu    ray is outstanding  .
if your a sports fan , this is a great set to go with as well  .
attention to detail is very good with this set , and the black levels are near crt quality  .
great buy at 2k or less , viewing environment plays a big role on buying a set , if you have a ton of ambient light or sun light you might want to look for a good lcd  .
very pleased so far  .
would love to give it a 10 but nothing is perfect , especially electronics  .
the set is truly spectacular  .
it is everything an hdtv should be when displaying high definition broadcasts  .
the big issue i have with it is trying to show slide shows of photos taken on digital cameras with cameras now approaching over 12 megapixels one doesn't think about shooting their images at crappy , lower resolutions  .
we capture our images at the highest resolutions we can for a reason posterity and quality the pioneer doesn't like high resolution images  .
they have to be taken at very low resolutions in order for the set to show them  .
but hey  .
just resample them with irfanview or some other photo software right  .
nope  .
that won't work  .
the tv refuses to display any image manipulated using a computer i've contacted pioneer customer service and they asked me to send sample pictures  .
i did and haven't heard back from them as to what their technicians were going to do about it  .
i had hoped that they would issue a firmware upgrade but that has not happened  .
the last contact i had with them is in october 2007 .
don't let the abysmal or 1 out of 10 reviews and ratings fool you , most of them are injecting their buying or servicing experience on the actual tv performance and respective rating  .
this is as close to 10 of 10 as you're going to find in any plasma or lcd tv under $3k (as of today a well    known big box retailer has it on sale for a penny under $2k)  .
before purchasing i compared panasonic and sonys top models , and albeit both 1080p sets and very good , they werent excellent  .
there's not another plasma or lcd that comes close at this price  .
picture quality is excellent and more than 6' away from this screen playing a hd or 1080p signal , you cannot tell it's only a 720p set (if you need a pro opinion , read the feb  .
edition of ht mag) the black levels are truly black , no graying or shadowing on the side bars  .
opposed to other reviews , i find the set to be quiet and cool  .
screen and lacquer finish is difficult to clean once finger printed , so just do not touch it and you'll be fine  .
plenty of inputs and excellent sound quality from the detachable speaker bar at the bottom (nice feature if youre running to 5/7  .
1 surround and dont need it  it can be removed)  .
menu settings are plentiful and allow good degree of customization to picture settings (useful for tweaking the blue green levels that are slightly off out of the box)  .
built    in cable    card slot is excellent benefit if you are placing where you dont want a cable box to be seen  .
integrated tv guide feature replaces need for cable companys guide  .
with comcast i is able to pick up multiple interim digital channels (i  .
channel 4 here in ny is nbc  on initial set up , the built    in tuner picked up 4  .
000 (nbc analog) and 4  .
001 (nbc hd) , 4  .
002 (another nbc 4 ver  .
) and 4  .
003 (the nbc weather)  .
another very useful note and something i is hard pressed to find in reviews , is that the analog tuner in this set is outstanding  .
i believe it performs some level of up conversion to an analog signal so standard def  .
tv looks great  on par or better in my opinion than tube  .
since most channels arent yet hd , this is of major concern for me  .
the standard def analog picture quality of the panasonics and sonys didnt come close in displaying a crisp picture from the analog signal  .
of 15 sets i looked at , this is by far the best sd picture of any set  .
only criticism i can offer thus far is the remote isnt backlit  .
the layout and features of the remote are great , but the glow    in    the    dark keys dont cut it in low light situations unless you hold the remote to a light bulb for 15min  .
first  .
fix the remote and add an easier to clean screen and finish , and this is a perfect 10  and dont be fooled by the numbers , compare this 720p hd set next to any 1080p set under $3k and youll be amazed at just how much better this really is  .
in your comparisons be sure to compare hd to hd and sd to sd  .
on a final note and to hopefully contrast just how good this set really is , i compared unfairly side by side with my theater projector (runco vx on a stewart screen) , and this comes fairly close  .
hope this is helpful and good luck with your purchase .
excuse my excitement in the summary , a british ex    pat is writing this review  .
based on many reviews here and other websites , this tv upgrade is a no brainer  .
i had been looking for a plasma or a lcd screen to replace my rear projection 1080 hdtv (kinda) which i've owned for four years  .
i wanted a top of the line regarding screen quality  .
this hdtv is $3500 when it first came out last year , now $2200 at b h it arrived from them in perfect condition (love those guys    as a pro photog i purchase everything though them  .
the plan is to upgrade dish network up to the hd plan  .
if you take this route and upgrade after purchasing , you'll probably make the mistake of being disappointed with the standard definition  .
and rightly so , as the picture is bad  .
that's just the way it is as these tv's really do show up the seriously bad and horrible low resolution in glaringly sharp details    in terms of artifacts that is however , once you upgrade to hd or pop in a dvd , the quality is out of this world  .
i can only imagine what blu    ray or hd dvd looks like  .
i have a harmon kardon 37 dvd player along with my hk amplifier , and man , well , spectacular is all i can say hd programming    .
this is what it's all about blacks or super deep  .
colors or natural  .
simply gorgeous  .
i've seen allot of hdtv's recently  .
go to circuit city or another big retailer and it can be very difficult to see differences between each screen as they whack up the contrast and brightness  .
ask for the remote to tone it all down and see for yourself  .
i came out of those places more confused to be honest so i returned to the pro research here and user opinions you've probably read many reviews by now if you've just got to mine standard def    .
on sd , there is a slight green tint difficult to control and eliminate  .
with hdtv channels i really didn't notice  .
in fact , since i upgraded my cable and now it's hooked up via a hdmi cable (versus the s    video on my old cable box) the blacks or better , less artifacts and less green)  .
other than that , you just cannot improve on sd resolution so we'll leave it at that excellent buy  .
even more so at the lower prices  .
get it and do not waste any more time .
the only thing i dont like is the shimmering pixels , and you get them on almost every plasma  .
the good thing is if you sit 7' or further you cant see it  .
on the buzz issue you can change some options to lessen the buzz  .
just do a little research on what to turn off .
you can find plasmas for less , but i'm extremely happy with the pdp    5080  .
my basement finishing project is in the works for over a year , and i spent a good deal of time investigating a number of products including plasmas from panasonic and vizio , plus lcds as well it looks great in the room , the picture is outstanding , and installation is a breeze  .
i spent far more time prepping and wiring the walls and installing the wall mount than i did getting the pioneer on the mount and connected if i had to find something to nitpick , it would be the remote  .
while it's laid out understandably and has a nice tv guide function , it is not able to control my av receiver  .
it has control codes for cable boxes , dvd players and vcrs but none for av receivers  .
this is a particular problem for me because i'm exclusively using the surround sound system of my onkyo receiver  .
there are other alternatives to compensate with , so i'd recommend the pdp    5080 even with the additional cost .
i want to start this review by saying that this is my fourth hdtv since 2001  .
i had a proscan    3800 crt which i just sold in august of '07  .
then i bought the sony kds    50a2020 rear pro which had really good blacks and shadow detail for a projection tv and it is 1080p  .
the perfect vision did a review which is what lead me to make the purchase so that i can have hdmi inputs and not only analog componet video a friend came over and saw the rear pro and fell in love with the picture and he knew that i buy and sell products on    line from time to time so he asked me if would sell it to him it is only one month in use so i sold to him for the price i paid i saw and opportunity for another upgrade which i did but this time i made a mistake and bought another sony but this time it is a flat panel lcd there new version the bravia    52w3000 what a mistake that was , it is like having a giant head light in my living room i used it for five day's and took it back to the dealer and that cost me some money because i had to pay a restocking fee of $200  .
00 so know that's my third tv already now i have another chance to make another purchase and this time it has to be right because with the mrs  .
there's no more chances this is when i really starting looking on    line for reviews on plasma tv's because this is the only flat panels that come the close's to the crt black levels i came across cnet's review on the pioneer pdp    5080 and started to feel like this is going to be the purchase for me i really would have like to purchase the pdp    5010 but my budget did not allow it to happen the pioneer pdp    5080 put a such a smile on my face when i turned it on that the picture i is looking at is like looking out of a window the blacks are true blacks with plenty of detail and awesome colors and even my wife is happy with this purchase i know it's not a 1080p but honestly speaking from the correct viewing distance you cannot even tell the difference blu    ray movies on this set is outstanding it handles every format you throw at it i see no motion blurr or artifacts what so ever water scenes are so 3d i cannot believe that i went through two other sets before purchasing this beautiful plasma pioneer's brand name kuro's for these plasmas are on the money my hat off to pioneer for making such a beautiful set , also all the things that are said about plasmas burn in with this set it seems that pioneer is the best innovator on this because i've been using this set for only a few days and i see no burn in what so ever and i'm a big hd movie buff from my time warner cable system no tv logos burn in or any thing else if there's anyone out there thinking of purchasing a plasma do not think twice about it go for the gusto as reviewers put it the kuros line of pioneer is the best in the planet .
buy this tv  .
its a bit expensive but worth it  .
david jang  .
i purchased this 12    2007  .
i have not been disapointed yet i replaced a pioneer 55 rear projection tv that is a work horse for 15 years .
after a couple months use , everything about this plasma spells quality , except for the piano gloss plastic bezel and pioneer's customer service , two factors you should weigh before buying pioneer and other manufacturers are using a piano gloss plastic finish for their products canon is one notable using this finish for their latest line of scanners  .
the kuro has it too , and why  .
because it looks nice  .
but the downside of this plastic finish is that it picks up hundreds of fine scratches  .
a few specks of dust , even when cleaned with a microfiber cloth , can result in scratches viewed from a distance , you don't know they're there , but take a close look and it's a different story why is this a negative point  .
i upgrade tv's every year or two , and sometimes up to every 4 years , and there's nothing that defrays the upgrade cost like being able to resell your tv and apply the proceeds to the new one you've got your eyes on  .
personally , i'd like to be able to say my kuro is cosmetically in mint condition , because that's a strong point when selling a used tv  .
imagine the difference to a potential buyer if you say , this tv is cosmetically mint , or this tv is cosmetically nice , but up close , there are fine scratches on that piano gloss my kuro arrived and the box is perfect  .
i is surprised to see it looking absolutely factory fresh , especially since my panasonic 60u (now in my bedroom)arrived with the box dinged and dented and looking like it had made a rough trip and then some upon opening the kuro box , and carefully setting it up , i saw these fine scratches in the piano gloss , and of course , pioneer's warranty doesn't cover anything cosmetic , even if it occured in packing on their end , which a pioneer rep told me it had  .
apparently , some piano gloss scratching is not uncommon when they pack this tv is it a big deal , or worth complaining to pioneer about  .
that depends on you  .
if you plan to resell later and want it to stay nice , it does , or you can look at it from the hey , for $3000 , i should get a little more quality control , point of view  .
both are valid the other negative is that pioneer's support is wretched  .
when i thought my tv might have an issue , and phoned them , it took 45 minutes and i is told that i'd have to arrange my own in home service call and pioneer would pay for it i then called back and is told that rep is mistaken , and they set up a service call , even though the tech did not show up  .
instead he did the support over the phone , and told me to call back if i needed to .
i continue to receive compliments on the picture from friends and relatives  .
i have a new 40 inch samsung (1080p) that i use for gaming and the kuro's picture is considerably superior to that  .
only trouble is , i now tend to watch more tv and movies  .
the reflective screen is very effective .
i have been ready to step up to a plasma or lcd 50 tv for about 2 years now  .
i wanted to wait until the prices came down a bit more  .
so this christmas i decided to take the plunge  .
it came down to 3 tv's  .
samsung (1080p plasma) , sony (lcd) , and pioneer kuro (plasma)  .
there is no comparison in regards to the plasma's  .
the pioneer for now is king of the hill  .
even at half the resolution the pioneers picture is still better  .
the experts have said this is due to resolution for tv's above 36 resolution is not even the 3rd most important factor  .
the cpu boards on the pioneer by far process way faster and better then any other plasma out there  .
so the resolution just doesnt mean much  .
and looking at the pictures side by side at best buy  .
the pioneer blew away the competition  .
i even asked 5 different salesman at best buy which tv do they own  .
all 5 had personally bought the pioneer  .
wow  .
read the cnet editor review for more imfo on this matter so now it is between the sony and the pioneer  .
again the picture qaulity is not even a contest  .
the pioneer again won the side by side battle  .
the only left to worry for me is the glare factor  .
many reviews say if the room has alot of light buy a lcd  .
my house is located in south florida on a 2 acre lake  .
its a 3500 sqft 2 story home with vaulted cielings and tons of french doors  .
i have tons of light reachiong the inside of the house  .
i dont use window treatments on many glass openings  .
so i is very worried abouit buying a plasma well i bought 2 pioneer 50 tvs 2 days ago  .
both get tons of light exposure  .
the best buy salesman said the light wont matter much  .
this tv has excellent antiglare technology  .
and he is right  .
in fact  .
i get a better picture qaulity then i saw in the store lol pioneer now has a 1080p model available  .
its 2x the money  .
around $5 , 0000  .
do yourself the favor and buy the 720p while they are still produced and save 50% of your money  .
the 1080p hype matters is small screens and cpu lcd tvs  .
tv's over 36 just dont have a huge screen qaulity difference  .
its all about the cpu boards of the tv and how fast they process the tv signal  .
1080p is a manufacturer hype so they can produce new tv's and make people spend more money  .
dont be fooled happy holidays folks .
for my kuro 80 series i've used the display settings posted from ultimate av web site review (link    http  //ultimateavmag  .
com/flatpaneldisplays/907piokuro/index4  .
html )  .
try them in the store also i found these settings the best of all i've read online so far    perfect for sports or movies    spectacular picture  .
yes lcd's seem much brighter by comparison (my sony is) but is that the ideal contrast of an accurate picture source  .
too many flat panels in the stores have their contrast set too intense  .
a quality picture source will often emphasize broadcast faults of live events (uneven lighting at events)    i notice some sports venues have improved lighting compared to others , its very noticeable .
screen technology that pioneer is perfect  .
or if people realize that kuro (koo    ro) in japanese means black  .
pretty straight forward name for a japanese industry that keeps making up strange names that mean nothing i love the picture on this unit  .
maybe i can afford one someday lol  .
i researched tvs extensively for probably way too long  .
it finally came down to the sony xbr4 lcd (40 ) and the pinoeer plasma (42 )  .
what finally put me over the top is the superior handling of standard definition programming by the pioneer  .
with only about 25 hd channels available right now most of my tv viewing is still coming in sd  .
for most sd channels i couldn't see a discernable difference between the plasma and my old crt  .
except when the sd is broadcast in wide screen then it looked better on the plasma  .
i found the xbr is grainy and a little washed out when showing sd  .
the pioneer also had much richer colours and deeper blacks than the xbr the quality of the hd will not disappoint you  .
i find my self watching the most ridiculous shows just because they are in hd  .
the national geographic channel is a must  .
and pbs has great shows for the kids in the morning  .
the set up is really simple and all the hdmi inputs greatly reduce the amount of cable clutter  .
i honestly do not think i could be any happier with this purchase .
i've been dragging my feet on buying a plasma but finally went for it after reading the cnet review and seeing it in action at best buy  .
i is between this tv and the panasonic t5084 , but the contrast/black level is noticeably better on the pioneer and that is what makes a picture extraordinary  .
i watched a deep sea diving show on discovery via directv and lets just say i is blown away    simply amazing  .
we live in a corner unit in a high rise w/significant ambient light issues but this tv handles it quite well  .
spend the extra grand , it is definitely worth it .
if you're looking for a great plasma , this is the one to get  .
it's loaded with nice features and you can get it for around $2600 including shipping and no tax (if you order online from out of state)  .
i would only buy from an authorized pioneer dealer  .
if you don't , the pioneer warranty is null and void  .
go to to www  .
pioneerelectronics  .
com for a list of their authorized online dealers  .
i bought from invision (http  //www  .
invisiondisplays  .
com/) and had the best experience with them  .
they are a family    run business and go the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied  .
they ship promptly since they have many distribution centers around the country  .
ask for roman  .
the only negative experience i had is the shipper (usfc) did not meet their scheduled time window due to unforseen circumstances which is a pain because i took a half day off of work to meet them at home  .
tv arrived the next day in perfect condition .
as many have said before , this set demonstrates the pinnacle of plasma sets today  .
i have been watching pioneer's pdp line since the 5060hd , when the tuner is external , and i am so glad that i waited  .
this set is stunning  .
watching a movie , the blacks will bleed directly into the surrounding bezel , and the color accuracy seems great despite innacurate green tones  .
this really does hit the sweet spot , price point i is able to grab this set for 2 , 300 dollars at visual apex , which best buy is unable to match , although they did consider it also as mentioned , make sure you grab this from a certified retailer , otherwise your warranty is moot this set proves that there is negligible difference between 1080 and 720 given todays standards , and although ill likely take this back 20 years from now , 50 inches is about as large as i can handle .
this tv is absolutely beautiful i did a lot of research about which type and brand to buy and is so happy when i finally landed on this one  .
the plasma picture is outstanding , especially in a dark room  .
all my friends just sit and gawk i personally love the auto    screen adjust function which allows the tv to stretch hd and sd images to full screen size with no problem i'm actually really happy with the sd quality considering (and i have comcast which has a terrible hd line    up)  .
the up    scale from my progressive scan dvd player (which is now 4 years old) looks great  .
also , tons of inputs to choose from which is nice i haven't used the speaker because i have an outside unit in terms of noise or jitter , i think the tv holds up very well but wide    pan shots (like from blimps) and fast moving shots still have a bit of that i guess it's to be expected with current technology  .
still    images are just jaw    dropping on this tv as for bang for your buck , i ordered my tv via deal south which sells through e    bay  .
i is a bit skeptical about buying online , especially considering how much cheaper it is , but overall i found the service to be very good  .
i received the tv in good condition and at about 40% less than traditional dealers are selling for (making this tv a bargain  .
only downside , is pioneer voids its 1    yr warranty if you do this , meaning you have to buy a supplemental coverage plan if you own one , enjoy  .
if you're considering , this unit is well worth the money do not think the elite will offer that much more to make it worth it .
this a great 50 plasma and compared to the pro series much more affordable  .
the tv gets pretty hot after watching it for a few hours  .
overall a terrific tv for hd channels  .
i've been following the pdp lcd wars for some years  .
i work in the business in r d and know what i'm looking at  .
quite simply , this is the best tv you can by right now  .
there soon will be a new pioneer 1080p model that might eclipse this one (at a hefty price premium i expect) , but for now it's the king of the hill i've had occasion to do very close comparisons between the new 120hz lcd's , the pioneer 5080hd and the new panasonic fhd models  .
the pioneer is by far the best of the lot the often mentioned black level is unique in the industry and i am confident that pioneer will maintain that edge due to their superior technology  .
perhaps even more impressive is this sets ability to avoid all manner of dynamic false countours and sustain very high resolution for fast screen action  .
using the nhk method of evaluating resolution loss , this set scores the highest of all flat panel tv's on the market today , sustaining ~ 900    1000 lines fo resolution for typical fast action  .
even the best 1080p lcd's (120hz)by comparison display less than half the resolution for moderate motion speeds  .
figures reported are typically in the 400    500 line range  .
also a feature is pioneer's luminous efficiency  .
this set spec's out at 2  .
2lm/w , an industry best for hd sets  .
this is in part what allows the set to achieve the very high contrast ratio and low power consumption fianlly , i really like the anti    reflective screen technology that pioneer is using here  .
the panasonic sets resort to a matte screen which badly distorts the image quality  .
when compared side    by    side to the panasonic 1080p set family , the pioneer 5080hd set looks better hands down  .
for the time being , the panasonic sets lack the luminous efficiency to achieve the contrast ratio needed to best pioneer  .
the panasonic screen looks more like an lcd's due to the lousy ar treatment  .
panasonic may get it better next gen , but for now pioneer is best .
i went to best buy to purchase the new sony dlp 60a2020 but out of the corner of my eye i saw this beast , the picture quality on this 720p set is better than any other 1080p set under $3000 , you don't need numbers , and editors , and awards to tell you that , just look at the picture , in hd , 720/1080 and sd it just looks better  .
period i have had it now for 3 weeks and no complaints yet , i have comcast cable and my xbox360 running on it all the time and the picture is amazing  .
i attribute my madden ranking to this tv the only reason i gave it a 9 is because it is expensive and the speakers should come separately as an optional add    on so i do not have to pay for them , who buys a 3000 tv and uses the tv speakers  .
this is no doubt the the best tv i have ever owned  .
bought a ps 3 with hdmi 1  .
3 hookup and the colors and audio are kickin the 1080 p the from ps 3 are automatically recognized and does not fluctuate purchased online and could not be happier  .
i've looked at the pioneer elite and for the money this is the best buy i have directv hd and even the hd channel are very vibrant and deep clear rich colors .
very pleased with both the picture quality sound fidelity  .
i have a dedicated video room and placed the pioneer side    by    side with a 46 samsung ln    t4665f lcd (also a very good flat screen tv)  .
after manually setting both systems for optimal performance given the room's lighting conditions , i simultaneously played the movie 300 using a pair of oppo dv    970hd dvd players  .
i must say that both flat screens performed extremely well and the differences took several long minutes before they they (shyly) reveled themselves  .
in the end the pioneer displayed notably better performance in color depth , modestly superior tracking/refreshing and appreciably superior sound quality (i assessed sound on the flat screen system speakers only)  .
had i not viewed them side    by    side , i probably could not have rated one superior to the other ; both the pioneer the samsung are very high quality performers  .
my goal is to determine which system to put on center stage in the video room , and the 50 pioneer plasma seemed to surpass the 46 samsung lcd in overall performance  .
dollar for dollar i'm not sure which has the better value , given the higher price tag for the pdp    5080hd , but strictly within the performance dimension i would recommend the pioneer .
this is the one  .
it came down to the 5080 and the panasonic 50pz700u , and although the panasonic is 1080p , i can honestly say that the 5080 offers the most stunning picture i have yet to see from a plasma  .
i also like that the bottom speaker attaches from the bottom of this set  .
for those who are still on the fence about this particular unit do not be it's picture is excellent .
i researched tvs for quite a few months before purchasing this pioneer  .
after deciding that plasma would be the best bet for my needs , i looked at quite a few  .
the pioneer 5070hd kept coming out on top  .
then they released the 5080hd  .
i do not know how much difference there really is , but i think the black levels are something of an improvement now that i have it home , i just cannot believe how beautiful it is  .
i love the elegant piano    black frame  .
the picture is absolutely exquisite , particularly with a 1080 signal (although it deals surprisingly well with standard def signals)  .
so far , i love everything about this set  .
just amazing  .
i purchased mine from www  .
access2  .
digital  .
com for about $2500 , including shipping to my door  .
they are an authorized pioneer dealer , so it came with the warranty , etc  .
they also persuaded me to purchase a three    year extended warranty for an extra $400 or so  .
probably worth it , given how much i'm spending  .
all in all , just a fantastic tv  .
go look at your local store and compare it to all the other tvs on the wall  .
you'll be able to see its smoother image and superior detail in dark scenes frankly , i think this thing is a perfect 10  .
the only reason i'm giving it a 9 is because it's not 1080p (not that i can see any difference it looked better than the 1080p panasonic it is next to at the store) , and because it's a hair more expensive than the competition but worth absolutely every penny  .
i've had this 3 weeks now and so far i love it  .
i have done a tremendous amount of research (plasma , lcd , pioneer , samsung , panasonic , elite , etc  .
i almost bought the pioneer elite 1150pro or pioneer pdp5070  .
waited and waited and finally jumped in  .
every one has different opinions as to which brand is better , i'm not an expert but i found (after lots of research) the pioneer to be superior regarding plasmas  .
the hd picture is unbelievable  .
some might like other brands better , but you cant really judge looking at tvs bunched on a wall together until you get it home and it stands alone  .
the difference is magnified  .
now the picture is not as good when not in hd but thats not why i bought it  .
i is going to hook it up to a surround sound system but decided to wait and as such the speaker that runs along the bottom actually sounds better than i expected  .
not that i expected it to sound bad but i didnt expect it to sound as good as it does  .
as for a recommendation i would absolutely 100% recommend the 5080  .
final note , of course the cable company had to fix wires so as to receive hd channels and while tweaking the cable box cable guy said the tv is adjusting the size of the picture to fit the screen better than the cable box  .
would give it a ten out of ten but nothing is perfect .
i just bought this television a few days ago and i really like it so far  .
the colors are very vivid on the screen , due to a screen blacker than any of the other plasmas that i have seen  .
i still need to hook up a hd source , but even with standard cable hooked up to it , it is nothing short of fantastic  .
let me first start by saying , wow  .
what a gorgeous picture  .
as picture quality goes , there truely is no better anywhere  .
best contrast on any plasma or lcd (no brainer there) that has been seen to date  .
and of course , pioneer always brags about the amount of gradation in color in their picture , well it is absolutely apparent in this set  .
pioneer offers a new optimum video setting on these tvs which is an ever changing adjustment in the picture so that every image is a beautiful as the next  .
very similar to the way the advanced iris settings work in the sony sxrd projection systems  .
my only concerns are as follows   there is no x  .
color support  .
as major bluray advocates like sony and mitsubishi have demonstrated , x  .
color gamut technology is going to be the future of bluray and for pioneer not to include that capability in any of their new sets or their new bluray disc players is more than disappointing to myself  .
and in a time where almost all major tv manufacturers are introducing the 120hz side scanning for smoother motion , pioneer has introduced the 60hz side scanning  .
well , before they had 72hz (also called 3  3 pulldown , which they still have)  .
i havent yet seen anything with this feature , but sony and panasonic sure are high on it  .
all in all , pioneer , even with their disappointments this year , continue to lead the pack as far as quality of picture go  .
if you are looking for a picture that is head and shoulders above the rest , welcome to pioneer .
recommend to everyone  .
i have been viewing tv's for a few weeks and i have read a lot of great reviews about the pioneer  .
however , when i see the television in the store , it seems noticeably dimmer than its competitors  .
i have noticed this at several stores on more than 4 occasions  .
i am sure that the black level and color is great in a pitch black theater setting , like the cnet lab they have described  .
but , i am not sure the pioneer would be the best set for a normal home setting , which is rarely pitch black and has at least some ambient lighting  .
i would like to get feed back from owners and other shoppers  .
is the pioneer too dim  .
this tv does not scale 1080p  .
does it even matter  .
yes , the 5080 is everything cnet says it is the tv produces an unbelievable hd picture and actually does a pretty decent job with standard definition unfortunately , in my experience at least , there are a few snags which the buyer should take into consideration  .
the tv seems to have a judder issue       no , i'm not talking about the purecinema modes , it seems to experience judder with just about every kind of tv source you can think of  .
not horrible , but definitely noticeable hdmi issues    i've worked through an hdmi handshake issue and now there is a bevel effect a mirror    like tear on the far side of the screen  .
this is with fios these issues may be related to source , but they are worth noting  .
i have not read about these issues happening with regular cable yet .
this is the body of user opinion  .
i spent many , many hours researching the best plasma/lcd picture available  .
i ended up selecting the pioneer pdp    5080hd based on the excellent black levels and picture quality i did a live check at a local electronics store and the pioneer had the best picture of any plasma or lcd in the store i have had the unit for a week and love the hd picture quality ; i only wish i had reviewed the hum problem before i made my purchase i found out the hum problem is more predominant at higher altitudes and i am at 7200 ft the hum is low level but if you have the sound turned low or muted it is very noticeable and annoying my fix ; crank up the sound through my pioneer receiver the operating instruction manual states that electrical circuit humming/bussing is normal for operation of this plasma display i recommend the pioneer plasma for the picture quality but beware of the hum issue related to any plasma set , do your researches before you buy  .
sorry but i did not research hum problems with lcd sets so you need check tm  .
i like this television but it is about as current with todays hd technology as those cheap tv's you see at walmart  .
720p just doesn't cut it  .
and please do not try to say resolution does not matter because it really does when you go past 40 inches or so  .
is impressed with this tv but not as much as the sam    lnt5271f or the sony xbr4 so i had to return it for a refund and get a 120hz/1080p/lcd  .
and i am very happy that i did .
i debated between the pioneer and the samsung 50 inch plasma pn50a550  .
even though the samsung is $500 cheaper , i went with the pioneer based on past quality  .
i have had the tv for a week and have been disappointed to say the least  .
the hd channels are no better than my old standard sony 27  .
the image transition is not smooth , and peoples' faces blur whenever they move  .
this still occurs after every setting is maximized , and the transition feature is on smooth  .
about 80% of the standard channls are not very clear no matter what settings the set is on  .
some are better than others , though  .
right now i'm debating on a return  .
my theory is if you are going to spend $2000 on a tv , it better be worth it  .
right now , it is not  .
maybe a 42 1080p (i) would be better  .
what's with all these spectacular votes of 9/10  .
if you want to artificially inflate the vote at least vary the rating and the term spectacular  .
i had a wierd problem that i have never had before with any tv  .
as soon as i took the television out of the box i noticed a bad smell  .
the set smelled like rotten eggs and a restroom  .
never had a problem like this before stay away from this tv unless you like stinky smells  .
i purchased a pdp    5070hd in march  .
it broke in july  .
it's still broken 9 weeks later  .

never purchasing a pioneer product again  .
our advice to consumers who are contemplating a pioneer purchase is to add in the cost of an extended warranty  .
or go with a competing brand that values its customers and stands by its products no customer would buy a product for over $2000 if they knew it would require $700 in repairs just 18 months later  .
pioneer customer service is arrogant , saying again and again that buyers are on their own after the warranty expiration , even when the company has had a history of power supply issues  .
this is the worst customer service for a large discretionary purchase i have ever experienced  .
we will not be buying a pioneer product again       regardless of the initial product quality and reviews .
if anything ever goes wrong with this tv you will not be satisfied with their customer service warranty claim department they will screw you buyer beware  .
read the opinions of those who have had the pioneer for more than a year  .
mine died after 15 months and the warranty is 12 months  .
pioneer will not even talk to you  .
if you must buy , make sure you buy all the warranty you can get  .
$600    700 to repair  .
buyer beware .
sure the image quality is great , if you live in a cave  .
the image is really dim , i bought a set brought it home plugged it in , played a dvd , blu    ray , hd    dvd , hd cable , and sd cable  .
2 days later packed it up and took it right back  .
the image it produces is very very dim , which may be how it achieves its great black levels if you turn the brightness up which would be a simple solution , the entire picture recieves a grayish tint and all that glory of wonderful black is completely lost  .
i even pulled the sales assiociate at the store on the side and had him try the same thing with the set in the store to see if i is wrong we tried everything but only recieved a dim faded image i cannot even imagine how dim the image will become as the set gets half way toward its half life  .
steer away , buy a panasonic plasma , or get an xbr lcd from sony .
tv is still under warranty , the pixels are misfiring a pink or orange color when they are supposed to be blue  .
the repair service has been to my house 3 times an is unable to fix it    even though they replaced the video board  .
now they want to take it to their shop for a couple weeks to replace some of the internal components , but they are guessing  .
meanwhile , pioneer customer service flatly refuses to replace the unit    they apparently do not do that  .
panasonic has tv's with comparable picture quality and lower prices , and they would have given me a new tv by now and taken the old one to fix on their own time  .
i wish i had bought panasonic rather than pioneer  .
i read all the reviews    this is typically a great tv so i realize i probably got a lemon , but they should replace it  .
save yourself the grief and go with panasonic .
