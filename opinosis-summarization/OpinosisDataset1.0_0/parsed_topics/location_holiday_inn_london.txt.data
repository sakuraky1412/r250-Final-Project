 great location for tube and we crammed in a fair amount of sightseeing in a short time .

all in all, a normal chain hotel on a nice location  , i will be back if i do not find anthing closer to picadilly for a better price .

great price terrific location .

the location is absolutely wonderful .

our main focus before booking was looking for a low price with good location .

very good value ,  excellent location .

 the location is ideal for travel all over the city via the underground .

excellent hotel in prime location .

good location horrible service disgusting procedures .

first and foremost, the good, yes it has good location, a block away from gloucester road tube station .

 the convenient location and competitive rates finally sold us on a repeat visit .

the location of this hotel is it's best feature ,  two blocks from the tube on lines that run to most major attractions .

the saving grace of this hotel, is the friendly staff and its location in kensington .

the positives were the location, a block from the gloucster rd .

 the public areas are fine if bland, the rooms comfortable if slightly cramped, the location good for tube and bus but just a little 'distant' .

its saving grace is its location .

 the location is excellent ,  near to the tube and walking distance of a lot of attractions .

 turned out to be this excellent property in a prime location .

 location could not have been better with the gloucester road tube station just a few minutes' walk from the hotel .

 bottom line is that i would definitely return to this property for its comfort and convenient location .

great location clean good place to stay !

 overall, i would recommend this hotel to friends, and would probably stay here again, because it was such a great location and clean .

 even better is the hotel's location ,  literally a two, minute walk around the corner and you're at the gloucester road tube station and a host of small shops, pubs and eateries .

great stay friendly service great location .

 i would say this is a better than standard hi and the location just can't be beat .

 i am giving a 'very good' based on staff, rates,and location .

 we liked the location and decided to stay again .

 the location close to a tube station and a grocery store is ideal .

average hotel in a good location .

this hotel is in a good location .

 if you want a reasonably priced place to stay in london in a convenient location, then this is a good choice !

excellent hotel excellent location would definately stay again !

in london its often hard to find good location and good customer service in the same place ,  the holiday inn kensington forum did that for me and i couldn't ask for more .

 it's rated 4, stars, but i also stayed at an equivalently rated marriott while in london, and a 3, star holiday inn express in scotland, and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations .

great hotel in a lovely location .

 excellent location next to gloucester road tube station that has 3 train lines making getting around london really easy .

good location one excellent concierge but problems .

 the location of the hotel is really good .

great location for sightseeing .

efficient hotel with a good location .

 the location is a block away from the underground station on the picadilly line direct from heathrow airport .

excellent hotel ,  great location .

good location new room bad service  .

the hotel was a great location just 1 block from tube, grocery stores, pharmacy and 2 blocks from natural history and victoria   albert museums .

convenient location not 4, star room and services but ok .

great location but definitely not a 4 star hotel .

location ,  this hotel is located around the block from the gloucester tube station   and a few atm machines .

great location but is it really 4 star ?

,  great location  ,  very good selection of food for breakfast buffet .

 the location was only a five minute walk from the gloucester road tube stop .

 great location, near gloucester road tube station, handy cluster of cafes, shops, couple of pubs, plus supermarket in the station complex .

 for the price and location, this was a very great hotel .

good location clean and comfortable .

great location but not sure it's worth the money .

 what you are really paying for at this hotel is location and in hotel restaurants .

 fantastic location very close to the tube and buses .

 it was a pretty good value and in a good location .

 we wanted something more spacious, but this hotel had extremely convenient location and good reviews, so we decided to stay there .

 the positives, great location, just a few minutes from a tube station which makes touring easy and with a travelcard taking midday breaks is easy .

apart from the location, the hotel was really not up to standard .

 it is a great location, the rooms are a bit basic, but clean and we actually got a pretty good view this time .

excellent location friendly staff .

went for a city break with the family hotel good location harrods 20 mins walk,royal albert hall 10 mins,and under ground around the corner,plenty to see and do around hotel .

 one good aspect of this hotel was the location, it is about 2 blocks to the tube station, shopping and eating .

 not too easy to find rooms for more than two people in london unless you compromise on a few things, such as cost, location etc .

location is not very good since one has to travel by tube to shop or sightsee .

 the location to the gloucester road tube station was very handy .

 we chose it due to its location i .

great location for first time traveller .

 when i approached one stewardess, she assured me that her airline used holiday inn kensington forum on a regular basis because of its location .

hotel was super average nothing great about it at all except the location .

since everyone starts with the good that i agree with ,  great location, very clean, i'll state the not, so good .

 one of the best features of this hotel is the location .

 the hotel's location is perfect for sightseeing and shopping   and the tube .

location great but hotel dated .

tower block hotel in fantastic location near good shops, bars and restaurants .

 the positives about the place are the views from the windows if you have an upper floor room, and the location next to gloucester road tube station and a small shopping area .

 for a little extra money, the soon to be crowne plaza over the road offers far better service yet with the same great location

nice hotel with great location for transportation .

we've stayed at this hotel before and it's always been a great choice for it's location, cleanliness and staff .

 very good location, next to underground station, very near to city center .

convenient location great concierge service .

 it isn't the most central location but i found it easy enough to get into london .

 i would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service .

great location and above average rooms .

 for the price and the location i thought this place was great .

 the location is just around the corner from the tube, boots and waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .

 its location is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful hyde park and just behind the corner of the gloucester road underground station   .

 even otherwise, no matter if it's going to cost you a bit more, i'd still recommend it, considering its location and overall standards .

 there was a lot of road noise, but this is only to be expected, given the location .

location is great, 5 mins walk to the natural history museum, 15 to kensington high st and 2 mins to the tube and in a high room you can see for miles   .

location was excellent with close proximity to tube station we will definitely stau here again , good value

great location for the tube and bus !

also it is perfect for the gloucester road tube station with direct trains to heathrow airport terminals,very good location turn right as you exit the station the hotels a 3 minute walk on your right hand side .

 location is very close to gloucester road tube so easy to get into central london for the tourist sites .

some positives are that it is in a good location for the tube .

 it's a great location   ,  literally a minute's walk to gloucester road tube station, 5 mins walk to the victoria   albert museum and the british science museum .

 but for the price, and the favourable location, we were content .

pleasant hotel very good location .

great location for all london has too offer .

 the hotel is in a very good location for touring london .

clean rooms, great location, close to the gloucester tube entrance .

 the one standout is location , ,  it's only about a block from the gloucester rd tube station, which is on the picadilly line that connects to heathrow, so being on the west side of london, it's a shorter ride to and from aiport and a very short walk to your hotel with no changes, and then you are close to public transport for the rest of your stay .

good hotel for the price nice location .

 no noise problems   and a nice, convenient location .

perfect location and excellent hotel .

room ,  clean, good size, everything you need is in the room including the coolerlocation ,  within every attractions, short walk or you can take the double decker just across the street .

great location ,  good value place to stay .

the holiday inn kensington forum benefits from a fantastic location, right next to gloucester road tube   or to paddington station for the heathrow express .

 believe me, the location alone is worth the stay .

the location is fantastic near gloucester station which was very handy for all our needs in transport !

the breakfast we had 1 morning was to say the least quite incredible there was so much variety, there was also no complaint in this area with the staff they were right on the ball   helpfulthis hotel while being high rise had some low moments for us as we felt some areas were really lacking but the hotels location is superb and staff like peter did try and make your stay worth while .

the location is south west london and a healthy but doable walk from landmarks like the museum of natural history, albert's hall, kensington gardens, and harrods .

locationa block from gloucester road tube which is conveniently on the piccadilly, district   circle lines .

 other reviewers are right, the entrance is in a bizarre location but once you figure it out, it's fine .

nice clean rooms, good value, and average location near a tube station, but the rooms directing towards the main street outside are all very noisy .

terrific location wonderful staff excellent pub !

 this was our first trip to london and we found the location to be excellent .

 lovely hotel, terrific location, wonderful helpful staff, immaculately clean rooms .

great location, 1 min from gloucester tube .

excellent location good value .

excellent location in the nice and relatively quiet area 100m from tube station and shops restaurants .

the hotel's location is the best thing about it ,  near the tube stop, museums and kensington high street .

for our purposes, the hotel was perfectly adequate ,  the location was good and the room was clean and quiet .

good location but need upgrade .

i really love the location of this hotel .

 but again, the location could justify charging that price .

the hotel is very nice and the location is excellent .

 if you're looking for a no, frills hotel that is all about location and price, this is your place .

 all, in, all this hotel was a great choice for the price and location .

the holiday inn kensington forum has a fantastic location for a city break in london .

 the best thing was the location .

good location ,near the tube  .

good price   location but no thrills .

 the location is great ,  very close to gloucester road tube, with waitrose supermarket, coffee shops and restaurants nearby .

great value and awesome location .

 instead you get attractively appointed, decent, sized rooms  , ac that works, a modern bathroom, plumbing that doesn't gurgle and bang in the night, iron and board, bathrobe and slippers, lots of tv channels and a location that can hardly be bettered .

 the location is terrific for museum, going and the royal albedrt hall is an easy walk away if you enjoy concerts .

great location nice rooms friendly staff .

great location service questionable .

 like other reviews, the location of the hotel is great, seconds around the corner from the tube .

 location wise, the tube station   is just around the bend and key restaurants bugis st .

 great location, close to the underground and several excellent pubs .

 everything was clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the location was excellent, all at a relatively cheap cost .

 location can't be beat, right on bus lines, next to tube station .

a nice hotel  a resonable rate and a great location .

 location of hotel is great, next to gloucester road tube, close to museums, short hike to buckingham palace etc .

location is the only thing it has going for it .

 great location, okay value and what you would expect .

on the positive side the location of holiday inn forum was very handy for a conference i was attending .

 the location is superb with the tube and bus stops literally steps away .

nice location by glouchester tube stop .

the best part about the hotel is the great location in kensington .

great location and great business hotel .

 holiday inn kensington forum is a perfect no fuss business hotel with fantastic location .

great location pub in the ground floor .

 having never been to london, i found it easy to get around to places of interest from this location   .

great location great breakfast !

 great location ,  we did what others have descibed and turned along cromwell road and went to the other holiday inn in error when we first arrived .

this was my second stay at this location in the past one year .

 the hotel is in an excellent location only a short walk to gloucester rd .

the location of the hotel is excellent, in a very nice area right next to the gloucester road tube station and direct on the picadilly line from kings cross .

we thought this was a great value for such a great location .

great location for vacationer .

the hotel was good and in a great location .

 you cannot beat the location !

 coming from cardiff, the location was perfect, as it was straight off the m4 and a short drive on the a4 before reaching the hotel .

it's just a great location, period .

 this hotel provided that and a great location to boot !

the hotel is in a good location .

convenient location for tourists .

 great location close to gloucester road tube stop .

 would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price i got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the touristy sites in london .

 convenient to gloucester road tube station, , location could not have been better .

 great location with cafes, restaurants and grocery stores all around .

all in all a clean room, great location near hyde park and all the stuff in kensington chelea, near tube station , quiet area .

great location clean and quiet .

 location is excellent to the tube stations .

the good thing about this hotel is its location, you are a 10 minute walk from harrods and £13 taxi ride to covent garden which will take you past all the tourist attractions :

 loved the location as it's only a 1, minute walk from the gloucester road tube station .

 i like this hotel due to its location, but the management need to get a grip .

 its in an easy location from the tube, just two minutes walk .

 the hotel has an unbeatable location in a very nice part of south kensington ,  only 1 block from the gloucester road station   .

 the location of the hotel is fine and actually the hotel is not extremely bad but it is extremely expensive .

we've stayed in london a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .

the hotel itself is truly in a great location ,  on the same road as the major london museums it took a leisurely 5, 10 minutes to stroll to the wonderful natural history museum   a further 5, 10 minutes up the road to harrods .

 if we hadn't experienced a problem with the a c i would have rated my overall stay here 5 5 for value, location, comfort, etc .

 location itself is great, but everything else is terrible .

 don t stay here unless if the kensington location is important to you .

geat location, clean, relatively quiet inside the rooms, somewhat confortable .

 the main reasons are location and the quality of the air conditioning .

 yes, the standard rooms are small for two people   and, yes, they seem to have a lot of trainee staff at the front desk, who struggle sometimes with the language, and yes some of the rooms are affected by traffic noise, but for a good location and a no, frills room provider, it is hard to beat .

   clean rooms, bustling lobby, great location .

 i will not recommend this location .

 i travelled during the off, season in january to london, this was my first stay at this location and i would definitely consider doing so again .

 less than a five minute walk from the tube station and within walking distance to the museum of natural history, really a good location .

, ,  the one thing this hotel has it going for it is the location .

with a kid and a stroller, this definitely is a very convenient location .

 cromwell is a pretty posh and popular location .

a fine hotel and great location .

 we could not have been happier with the location or the room for the price .

great location indifferent service .

 this being our first ever visit to uk, must say the location of the hotel, just 2min walk from glousceter rd tube stn was a great advantage as even during the weekend, piccadely line remained open, though distict and central lines had some restrictions on a c of maintainence etc .

good value and excellent location .

 booking through priceline led me to the holiday inn kensington forum which was inexpensive, in a great location, and clean and comfortable .

 the location of the hotel is great because it's about a block from the gloucester road tube station which is on several tube lines .

 in short, the location of the hotel made travel around london and getting to train stations to go out of london incredibly easy .

 overall, we felt this hotel was in a convenient location and a good deal for a london hotel .

 as other reviewers mentioned, good location and lots around to do eat see enjoy .

nice hotel with great location .

 the location is excellent, just a half a block from the glouster rd .

 also, the tour bus most likely will not drop you off at your hotel after the tour, but rather at victoria station or some location nearest your hotel as the bus driver can get .

 also, the close location of the gloucester road tube stop is great for getting around all of london .

 great location ,  a couple of minutes walk from gloucester rd underground station, and shops, restaurants, internet cafe etc

great location but don't bring the car !

 the location is great however, only 5 mins walk from the gloucester road tube and 10 mins walk to the south kensington museums, albert hall, etc .

 the hotel is in an ok location ,  close the the gloucester rd tube station .

the location of the hotel was great .

 otherwise, really great location with the refrige being key .

this is our 2nd time at the kensington forum and love the location .

location was great come out of tube station, take first turn right and walk 150 yards   you're there !

 location was great ,  close to tube stop .

the location of the hotel was excellent, a 5 min stroll from gloucester road tube, next to tesco express and a large supermarket just around the corner .

 the location is perfect, very central and very near the subway .

 however the location was great with the underground and good restaurants   nearby .

one of the nicest features about this hotel is the location .

so many employees, a wonderful location, an impressive building .

well, after all, as i said, great location, great view, nothing else !

 on a positive note the location is great and the overworked staff did their best however if visiting london their are definitely better options such as the nh which is just around the corner .

 perfect location, right around the corner from the tube .

 our parents who are 55, 70 were able to wonder around the entire city by themselves due to the ideal location of this hotel .

 nothing fancy but we were quite happy with the location of the hotel, just like most who have stayed at the hotel before .

 overall, we found the hotel only good for location and decent room if somewhat cold just like the weather was in london then .

 the breakfasts were excellent and the location is great for viewing london by bus, on foot and by tube  , which is just at the end of the road .

great location, very clean miami fl .

 the location in the kensington area could not have been better, the area is safe, nice and fairly quiet .

a great location, friendly and polite staff, first class breakfast and rooms as described above will have me returning again and again .

 very convenient location for gloucester road tube .

the location was excellent with a number of good eating options locally and garfunkels and ask pizza located in a complex within a very short walking distance for kids   who want something easy .

 brilliant, behind tube station, near local stores, restaurant, posh area, near kensington park, great central location yet quiet enough in a cul, de, sac location .

 flaw location of main entrance, big signs and big flags on main street but enter from the back, tiny miserable unwelcoming cheap entrance design, confusing to first time visitors .

the only reason to choose this hotel is its location, for other aspects, not up to standard for its price .

 the forum holiday is a big high rise and right across the street, is another holiday inn, albeit it much smaller which tends to confuse people looking for that 2nd location hotel .

great location and hotel for the money .

 the location in south kensington is excellent as the gloucester road tube station is just around the corner and is served by 3 main lines, , district, circle and piccadilly .

 can't say enough about the price, quality, location and convenience of this hotel and area .

 good points excellent location really very close to the tube and the tube is on good lines so not lots of changing .

 the location is in a good location near the tube and only a few minutes by cab to central london   .

 although in some ways i would have preferred a smaller, more authentic english hotel, we really couldn't beat the combination of price and location   .

location is good if you plan on taking the tube .

would recommend the holiday inn kensington forum for location, price  , and cleanliness .

decent rooms and good location .

stayed at this hotel, for one night, as the location was ideal for our night out at the royal albert hall   .

as also said before, location is excellent, very near the tube stations, plenty of delis and eating places nearby and a supermarkets for any snacks we wanted for the room .

 location is great, hotel is wonderful, and price is right, it really is hard to beat right now .

good location great deal on priceline .

this hotel is in a very convenient location, just a block and a half from the gloucester road tube station .

 comfortable room with large bed but limited space as is often the case with london hotels, but i found the location excellent .

stayed between xmas and new years and the room, location, etc were what to expect for the price i paid .

 the location was great too as it was next to the tube .

excellent location but rooms far too hot .

 hotel but would stay again if the price was right due to the excellent location .

good value in a good location .

 the location was ideal for getting around london .

which leads us to ,  location, this hotel's best feature .

stay here ,  you won't regret it,  great price ,  great location .

the hotel location was absolutely perfect for sightseeing and shopping .

 overall, for the money, location, and for the piece of mind knowing that its going to be clean and comfortable, look no further .

perfectly adequate  excellent location .

 the location was great, just aroung the corner from the tube .

 but we also didn't give them any hard times, so they didn't have to fake anything  ,   the location of the hotel is just perfect .

 as everyone mentions, the location was perfect for sightseeing .

,  very clean,  quiet,  bathrooms appear to have been updated recentlythe hotel location is great .

 the location is fab ,  near the gloucester underground station and the waitrose grocery store .

excellent location shame about the service !

 fantastic location and local amenities i .

 the location is great and the tube station is very close .

 good hotel for the price and location .

 apart from that, the staff were friendly and the location is great .

 the location is incredibly convenient, with lots of restaurants and easily walkable to the tube .

the single thing to recommend this hotel is the location, which is excellent .

the location is excellent, just round the corner from the subway .

 friendly helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms and not to mention its great location .

this hotel is in a very good location ,  tube, buses, restaurants, shopping and museums all within very easy walking distance .

 all in all, if you do not mind giving up the euopean atmosphere, the holiday inn gives you a comfortable stay with the most convenient location .

location was great being only a few yards from the gloucester road tube on piccadilly, circle and district lines and was therefore an ideal base for our sight seeing visit .

 great location and can't beat the price and the comfort !

 since this location is the designated layover site for american airlines, there were tons of pilots and flight attendants everywhere, but that added to the  familiar  feeling of having americans around .

 pleasant staff, clean hotel, comfortable beds, with a great location .

good price great location would definately stay there again !

 anyway it may not have the charm or history of other hotels in london, but for the price location we would   visit again .

excellent location clean but small .

the best feature of this hotel is it's location .

the location is perfect with many everything you need just outside the door including a great french patisserie and coffee shop .

 best part of all is the location, loved the gloucester road tube station nearby and the south kensington area in general, very safe to walk around in any time day or night .

 gloucester road tube station is at the westernmost side of zone 1, making it a perfect location between the airport and central london .

the location of the hotel is superb ,  2 minutes walk from gloucester road tube   .

 location is hard to beat though .

the hotel was clean, the beds were comfortable and the location was great .

 maybe i'm being a little harsh so if you can get this hotel at a good rate it is probably just about worth it, as it has an excellent location .

awesome location comfortable rooms .

great service and perfect location !

 i would definately recommed this hotel to anyone as it is unbeatable for price and location in london .

 i wanted a good location, above all else, and this hotel fills that need .

for a similarly good location  , you can stay at the london hilton metropole for the same price and receive much better service .

 it's a great location and the rooms are nice and clean and yes, a bit small but definately not tiny .

 it's a great location very near the gloucester rd tube stop   .

 perfect if you are going to see the sights in london, , great location to get around from, , right downtown .

a decent hotel with a great location .

 the raves about the location are well deserved .

 it's a solid property, with an amazing location !

again the location just can't be beat !

great location ,  just fine for our stay .

very convenient location one block from gloucester road tube station .

 it is in a very good location for catching the tube or the hop on hop off bus tour .

  the hotel caters to airline personnel, cruise tourists, and is a good choice for someone that wants to have a safe location .

good location if you want to be near the piccadilly line to heathrow  , but otherwise very average .

solid deal in a great location .

excellent hotel excellent location !

location wise it is a 5 min walk to the tube and you are on the circle, district and picadilly line .

 the location is great though to get to the tube and sites around west london and i got a good rate for the room .

the top feature of the holiday inn kensington forum is its location, in a superb area of london that's clean, safe and interesting .

not impressed at all and will not stay again despite good location .

 but it's great value for money, great location, pleasant staff, good food, and we'll be staying there again .

we thought this modern, efficient hotel was excellent value for such a great location in the heart of london .

great location  great breakfast  bathrooms tiny .

 the location of the hotel is, as stated earlier, absolutely fine and well within walking distance of the v a, natural history museum, science museum and hyde park .

 the location can't be beat , ,  a two, minute walk from the gloucester road tube stop .

 great location, close to a tube station with a 24 hour tesco metro nearby   .

 mother was very pleased with the location and convenience .

 great location and bargain internet price !

 the rooms are a standard european size   but they are kept spotlessly clean and the hotel couldn't be in a better location .

the location of the hotel was brilliant ,  really nice area .

 still, if you're just looking for a cheap place to lay your head, the holiday inn kensington forum is a great location .

 the location is fantastic, , you're literally around the corner from the tube station  there's a sainsbury's supermarket right above the aforesaid tube station   .

another plus is its location ,  convenient to the tube, museums, shops, etc .

this was our second stay stay at this hotel based on it's location .

b basis hotel huge ,  900 rooms buffet breakfast good for a buffet this is a well run hotel with a great location for the metro  rooms a bit on the small side but i would stay again

 the location is also good because it is literally 150 footsteps   from gloucester road underground station .

i have stayed in a few hotels in london while touring but it would be difficult to find a better location in london for the tourist class who is looking for value, efficiency and cleanliness .

 the location and american standards   are nice touches .

 the location was perfect, just a minute from the gloucester rd .

 we were easily able to navigate the city from this location .

 the hotel is clean, modern, and in an excellent location .

 but we would definitely stay again because of the hotel's location .

 aside from that, the location is great and the furnishings were modern and very comfortable .

excellent location and service .

 the location is excellent, just a short walk from the gloucester road tube station and in a lovely neighborhood .

 overall an above average hotel based on location and price   but not one for a romantic get, away !

location is fantastic ,  both on bus line and underground, with many useful stores on gloucester rd .

this is a good basic hotel which has a terrific location .

,  checked us in at 11 am after a transatlantic flight,  room larger than average, compared to our continental europe travel,  location, location, location  .

 the location is right next to the picadilly line tube stop, so it is very convenient to get around town and also to the airport .

great location, grocery store open 24 hours within 5 mins walk and friendly international staff, will stay here again .

great location ,  but executive room not worth it !

we enjoyed our trip to london ,  and the location for the holiday inn kensington forum was terrific .

i do recommend the hotel ,  it was clean, excellent location, there was ice on the top floor along with one microwave, etc .

 right off of the piccadilly and circle tube lines, the location is excellent .

 it is a relatively new hotel, clean and has a great location which is close to the underground with 3 connecting lines, it gives you an advantage to go anywhere without changing lots of trains .

 fantastic location right next to gloucester rd tube station .

excellent location service cleanliness and price at the holiday inn kensington forum .

 all in all great location ,  nice restaurants nearby, nicely pitched service .

 speaking of the tube, the location really is great 1 block away !

 the location of the hotel is excellent .

  like others, i liked the location with restaurants, glouster tube station, small grocery stores, , , and internet cafes within easy walking distance .

the location of the hotel is excellent ,  one block from the tube gloucester rd and the surrounding neighborhood is fantastic ,  take a walk from high street kensington to the hotel ,  i'd love to live there !

great hotel great location great value !

 the biggest advantage of this hotel is it's excellent location just off of gloucester road in kensington, with the undergroud one block away, along with several nice restaurants and pubs in the area .

 although the location is a bit removed from the west end, it is only a block away from the gloucester road underground, with three train lines that will take you almost anywhere in the city in 15 minutes or less .

great location good but large tourist hotel .

 the location is great and very convenient .

the location is great but there are many hotels in the same area so i might try out others but would certainly consider coming back .

can't beat the location, rooms, value and view !

good value nice hotel fantastic location .

holiday inn kf has a location that cannot be beat .

 this is definitely the location you want .

great location loved the hotel .

 the tube station is right there and the location is great for getting around london .

 you could not beat the location or the price .

 the price is moderate for the service and the location .

i will say this hotel is in a wonderful location, right across from the gloucester tube station and only a stop or two away from notting hill, harrods, and kensington high street .

location is so convienent to the tube and grocery .

 other than room size, we were very happy with the hotel, especially its location .

 overall good hotel and very good location close to the tube   .

 the hotel has a great location with easy access to most of london's tourist sites .

 the room is a tad small but is super clean and great location .

 the price, the space, the location and the service were the exactly right thing we wanted .

yes i do stay here a lot and as such, guess that i get extra special treatment but it is in a great location with the tube within a 2 min walk surrounded by places to eat and drink and far enough out of central london to be quiet but you can still be in the west end in 15 minutes .

great location comfortable hotel .

outstanding location, even an internet cafe nearby .

 the hotel is in a great location .

 great location, freshly renovated, very small rooms, anonymous hotel, acceptable service .

 the location couldn't be better in my opinion .

price and location can't be beat .

 as said by others, an absolutely excellent location, on tube lines that will get you to just about anywhere .

 the location could not have been better with being so close to the underground station and near good restaurants, grocery stores, post office, pharmacy, internet cafe .

 the hotel is set in an absolutely ideal location, offers great rates, and excellent conceirge   .

 great location, one block from the gloucester tube station with a number of acceptable restaurants in the area within walking distance .

best location and unbeatable price !

this is an awesome location right near the gloucester road tube stop .

 definitely stay here if you are on a budget ,  and even if not, it's still nice and the location is really the best !

 a true bargain in the london hotel market, and a very convenient location adjacent to the gloucester road underground station .

excellent location but a couple of problems .

 the location is excellent being a few minutes walk from gloucester road tube station with its good connection to heathrow airport and to central london .

great choice in a great location .

 the location could not be better ,  one block from the intersection of cromwell and gloucester roads, with the glouster road tube stop .

 i say  fortunate  because the location was perfect for my needs as a first, timer .

 this is definitely a modern hotel, no english charm here, but the location and the price can't be beat .

 the location could not be better and best of all it was so clean .

 everything worked well, was in good condition and the room was quiet in spite of the hotel's busy location .

 service was great and the location of the hotel was very convenient   .

great room fabulous price wonderful location !
