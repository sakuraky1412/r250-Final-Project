good but pricey food, great breakfast .

in any case, i had allotted approximately $150 for “food” for 4 days 3 nights .

ed debevics is fun, , sassy servers, diner food, total check about $30 for all four of us .

staying with food, try also the weber grill, n .

the hotel buffet had fabulous food .

as far as food, walk a few blocks toward michigan ave turn left or right and there are plently of less expensive places to eat .

the italian food was superb .

no line, a plate full of real food with drink included for $7 each .

food unexceptional although the breakfast buffet in the basement restaurant   was of good quality .

a nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food .

i didn't dine in the hotel, so i can't tell you about the food .

the food for our event was delicious .

took the charge of the minibar which we had used to keep my 2 year old sons food .

i was delighted as the waiters were very friendly and the seafood was delicious .

mile with traditional italian food and a great atmosphere .

room service was efficient, average priced, and decent food .

very friendly servers and nice selection of food at a reasonable price .

an added bonus was the executive lounge with complimentary food throughout the day .

we never ate anything onsite so i can't vouch for the food options immediately avialable .

very much enjoyed the chicago food tour, a walking tour that incorporates food tastings at various places like a bakery, traditional deli, pizza, chocolate lounge, etc .
