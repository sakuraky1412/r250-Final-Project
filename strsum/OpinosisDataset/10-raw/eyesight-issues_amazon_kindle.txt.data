This means you can read for longer periods of time without eyestrain .
E, ink hardly strains your eyes .
'Easy, on, the, eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink :
For me, it was no problem at all, no eye strain after reading for a few hours .
Truly, this helps in my eyes .
