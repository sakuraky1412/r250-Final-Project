keyboard feels funny at first, but you get used to it .

i like the keyboard, i like the speakers .

the only comparable keyboards i found were those on much larger laptops .

small keyboard with some double, function keys

keyboard is not as sturdy as i would like has some minor flex

excellent keyboard for typing .

,  keyboard feels well laid out

the keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .

has a very long battery life, runs videos and multimedia smoothly without issues, fast loading, very usable keyboard, stylish sleek design, decent pricing for what you get

my keyboard also seems a bit noisy .
