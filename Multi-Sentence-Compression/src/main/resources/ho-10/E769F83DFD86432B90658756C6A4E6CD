but when i was there , platform screen gates installation was going on at the the bella center stop , which is a stop away from orestad ; that meant i had to get off the metro to-and-fro city centre at bella center , and had to wait and board the next metro which was headed towards vestamager ( a stop after orestad ) instead .
i did not think it was much of an issue that the hotel is located 6-7 stops away from city centre ( norreport ) , since getting there via metro usually takes about 15 minutes .
the hotel is about a five-minute walk to the nearest orestad metro ( green line , metro line 1 ) , right next to field 's shopping mall .
the hotel room was cozy though i did not get much of a view , there was complimentary wifi access in rooms , and the showers in the bathroom worked just right !
installation works aside , i will gladly stay at crowne plaza copenhagen towers for my next visit , the rides out to city centre daily was a good way to start the day .
so if you need to get some shopping done , you probably want to be there ( or most other shops , for that matters ) earlier !
the staff at the hotel 's reception was warm , welcoming and patient , he drew a map and gave directions to the nearest metro on the first day of my arrival .
the hotel is less than ten minutes ( via the hotel 's complimentary shuttle ) to the airport .
to locate the airport 's shuttle upon arrival , it is outside terminal two , you have to cross the road and walk out to one of the bus bays , the shuttle is a black vehicle with the hotel 's name across it .
do remember to book the airport shuttle the day before you are due to leave to ensure there are seats , the shuttle arrived on time at the hotel for pickup on day of departure .
