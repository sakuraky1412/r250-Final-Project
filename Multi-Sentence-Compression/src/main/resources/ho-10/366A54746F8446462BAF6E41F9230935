on leaving , i again did n't say that we had got engaged , but explained the farce of getting a bottle of wine that was supposed to be there in the first place .
however , whether i take the hotel up on their offer of a free upgrade is yet to be seen !
the room was excellent though , although i can not understand why there would be a flat-screen television with terrible reception on it in a plush room !
luckily , the hotel on this occasion was not going to impact on a romantic meal , shakespeare play , and some songs sung with the help of the guitar . . .
i did n't think anything of it , but emailed back to ask how much a bottle of champagne would be in the room/upgrade to a suite etc .
i do n't believe in telling a hotel that you are going there with the purpose of proposing , there should be good service at a 4-star hotel whatever . . .
as i had originally booked with laterooms ( with a bottle of wine in room on arrival ) , i noticed afterwards on their official website that they did a romantic package .
i proceded to walk to the restaurant and eventually ended up in the kitchen and found a chef who exchanged it for a bottle of white .
pool freezing , and the sauna was not on and had to wait for it to warm up . . .
upon arrival , the staff were ok , but not very welcoming , and when we went up to the room , there was only one towel and no wine .
