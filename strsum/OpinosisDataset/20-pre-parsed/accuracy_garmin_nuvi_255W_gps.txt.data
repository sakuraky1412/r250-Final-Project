it provides immediate alternatives if the route from the online map program was inaccurate or blocked by an obstacle .

it has yet to disappoint, getting me everywhere with 100% accuracy .

easy to use, excellent accuracy, nice and intuitive interface .

it got me from point a to point b with 100% accuracy everytime .

but, it's always very accurate .

,  very accurate but with one small glitch i found ,  i'll explain in the cons

less traveled rural roads will not be accurate on any unit .

the estimated time to arrival does not seem to calculate the travelling time accurately .

the directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .

my new garmin 255w had very easy set up, accurate directions to locations, user friendly unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .

aside from that, every destination i've thrown at has been 100% accurate .
