It supplies great tasting water and removes many toxins, according to the literature that accompanies them.
I use the water for my coffee, tea, home made soda [Sodastream], and drinking water.
It removes contaminants and lead according to the literature, and it does improve the taste.
No leaks and the water tastes great.
This is the OEM filter.
I also make a habit of replacing these whenever the "replace light" comes on.
Fit perfectly in my fridge.
Very satisfied with the taste.
This OEM filter works perfectly as expected.
Fits my Samsung fridge.
