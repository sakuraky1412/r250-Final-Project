i am a bricklayer in minnesota  .
i work on swing stage scaffolding and jlg bucket lifts  .
one day while i is working four stories in a jlg the worst thing happened , my phone fell and bounced out of the jlg lift  .
it fell four stories down to a concrete sidewalk and pieces flew every where  .
i collected all the pieces and put it all back together and is amazed to find that my phone turned back on and has worked flawlessly ever since  .
the only damage done to it is a dent on the corner of the phone cover  .
there is also the slightest scratch (dent) on the phone , but is barely noticeable  .
nothing is broke , not even the display had a crack  .
i still cannot believe how tough this phone is , but in my book , it's the best  .
i like the moment  .
it is the most phone i can afford to get me as close as i can to the evo or iphone  .
i can not afford the package for or the phone  .
has lots of free apps from google to keep it fun  .
over all i love the phone  .
i see consumer reports give it low or ok reviews , but myself and others that have this phone seem to have a different opinion about it  .
in my opinion it is much better then the hero or any blackberry  .
the controls are great and the phone is very responsive  .
the sound quality of the calls are great and i get better signal on this phone then any other phone i've owned or used  .
the phone also comes with a 3  .
2mm jack so it also works as an mp3 player  .
you can download the songs on the go and use any headphone or car jack  .
it also has apps for internet radio such as pandora and apps to make ringtones that work better then myxer  .
i would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking to buy a new android phone .
retrieving messages is really simple  .
you dont have to listen to twenty messages before listening to one  .
you actually just click on the number listed on your phone and listen to each message  .
you dont have to go through each message  .
the android applications are amazing .
the saying goes moment does , if you are willing to put time into updating and customizing , the moment simply is too much  .
this phone has blown my expectations , in everway and i'm coming from the iphone , this sprints best phone today , a great choice to be able to wait until the htc evo comes out  .
you will miss the keyboard i guarantee thou and its beautifull amoled  .
i bought the moment yesterday and have absolutely fallen in love with it  .
i is a dedicated blackberry (tour) user but i use the ipod touch for music  .
so , i've been wanting a touch phone and is contemplating leaving sprint to go to verizon to get the blackberry storm  .
my husband bought the moment and asked if i wanted one  .
i said sure and decided i'd give it a try  .
i figured if i did not like it , i could go back to my blackberry tour anyhoo    i absolutely love this phone  .
there are tons of free apps available in the market  .
i've only downloaded a few , but they downloaded quickly the web browser took some getting used to but i now know that you have to use the menu feature the only complaint i have about the moment is that if my face touches the screen while i'm talking on the phone (not using my bluetooth) , it'll hang up or engage the 3    way calling feature  .
so , i've taken to kind of holding the phone away from my cheek  .
regarding the battery issue i've read about in these reviews  .
it's now 12pm and the battery indicator has turned from green to orange and it looks as though it's about to die  .
so , i'm going out to my car on lunch break to re    charge it have fun  .
i could not decide between this phone and the palm pre for weeks before going to see them first hand  .
as soon as i played with each for a while i knew i wanted the moment , it is so intuitive to do whatever i wanted  .
the intuitive nature of the phone is more a tribute to the android os than the phone but the phone controls and screen did help in this area , plus the performance is incredible  .
i have had this phone for a week now and want to tell anyone on the fence about it not to hesitate  .
i tried many phones including droid , iphone , hero , and samsung hd , and this is by far my favorite  .
do not listen to what people say about the battery life  .
they have to have everything running all the time without a task manager and have a phone without the new cl14 update  .
i kill the tasks and got the update and my battery life is about two days with moderate use  .
you must charge up to 100 percent and drain twice to get the battery working to maximum potential  .
there is not a phone out there that really has anything over on this and i had many of the best .
this phone might be a little expensive , but its definitely worth it because its like having a computer , an mp3 player , a digital camera/camcorder , and a phone all in one , and it fits in your pocket  .
ok , to start out with , i'm one of those people that drank the apple kool    aid several years back  .
i love my macs i owned the iphone since day one  .
it truly is a revolutionary device  .
the one thing that became glaringly evident to me over the past year , is that first and foremost , these devices are phones  .
in my case , i rely on my phone (and the 24 others that i own for my company) to do business  .
email is important  .
phone quality is important while the iphone has all the wonderful bells and whistles , dropped calls , late texts , and sometimes poor email synchronization were starting to cost me and my company money  .
after three revs of the phone , mys frustration met its boiling point  .
i could no longer rely on at t at least in the cleveland area so my search for a new phone began  .
i heard the promise of the android operating system and decided to take a look  .
i gave both verizon and sprint a try  .
tried the droid absolutely hated it  .
keyboard is useless , poor form , fit and function (at least for me) , seemed sluggish , just not that impressed  .
went over to sprint they had an htc and samsung android tried the samsung because of the keyboard  .
absolutely fell in love with it  .
to many people this may be surprising because of its utilization of 1  .
5 over 2  .
1 (it is getting the update)  .
it just works great  .
i love the fact that it is so customizable (all androids are)  .
but what stood out is that this phone really works for a business person with that keyboard  .
i am extremely happy with my purchase  .
i never thought i'd say this , but i really do not miss the iphone at all  .
i think this phone is the best option among other sprint phones so far .
awesome , awesome , awesome .
i loved this phone before the update but after it the weaknesses are addressed very well  .
the only problem is you have to go into the store to get the update  .
but , in a few weeks it should be over the air  .
this phone has it all    fast processor , slide out keyboard , very nice camera with a flash , capacitive amoled touch screen , and much more including android operating system  .
when os 2  .
1 gets released to this you will be hard pressed to find a better all around device  .
i love this phone    it is a dream to type on , is very snappy , and i feel like i'm always connected  .
you will save soo much money over the life of this phone when compared to one from verizon or at t because sprint's very generous $69 smart phone plan  .
this phone also 'roams' on the verizon network for free so you really loose nothing in terms of coverage  .
the camera may not have the same mega    pixels as the droid       but unless your goal in life is to zoom into pimples you will find that it just does not make a difference       and the led flash produces brilliant results .
this fone feel really good in the hands and the battery is good not what other people be saying it dies fast  .
its good too me  .
it's an amazing phone with a great qwerty keyboard  .
if your with sprint i recommend it  .
i love it  .
updated  .
on dec 26 , 2009  .
i love this phone and i have used just about every smart phone there is since i review them on a monthly basis  .
this phone has a robust list of features , a slide out physical keyboard , and a processor to support them along with a amoled capacitive screen  .
just a joy to use  .
i have owned many phones (iphone , hero , touch pro , samsung hd , among others)and this is the best phone i have had the pleasure to use to date  .
there are very slight issues such as the battery showing 15 percent for 5 hours of use  .
but that has cleared up some in time  .
i think a firmware update in january will take care of that problem  .
but overall this phone is quick , has a beautiful screen , very nice physical keyboard with nice feel , (which i kept the plastic coating on and trimmed it to protect the keys from any water)  .
great camera with a flash for dark rooms and night shots , loud speaker and quality sound on ear piece , android market , and many other goodies that makes this phone rule  .
sprints samsung moment is the android phone to get , the iphone and droid wish they were on the sprint network so they can try to keep up with this bad boy this phones screen is a step beyond most other phones , the android os with google is awsome and works as expected  .
samsung once again packs features and ease of use into an excellent device  .
sprints 3g is fully utilized by this phone and paired with the moments processor this phone is fast all around  .
wifi works great , gps / maps great , keyboard better than expected , call quality a+ , huge # of android application available  .
signal is one of the best i have had  .
battery life excellent get one i am so glade i got this phone .
me gusta el momento excellente  .
i just love this phone  .
the longer i have it the more i love it  .
i had this phone for over a month and love it  .
if you buy this phone after buying the hero you will not regret your decision  .
i had the hero for a month and the samsung hd for a few weeks and this phone trumps them both .
i love this phone  .
i have tried many top of the line phones and many of them are missing one feature or another like a flash for the camera , slow processor , or a hardware keyboard  .
this phone has everything you could want that really matters  .
just get it and you will enjoy having a complete product  .
enjoy  .
all i have to say is this phone has not received the respect and dignity that is deserves from the opening gate  .
i have owned many phones iphone 3 gs , hero , touch pro , and others  .
this is my favorite and a winner  .
my first android is the htc hero which strangely gets better reviews than the moment  .
the heros battery is so bad that every time i sent a few messages i had to recharge  .
i have no such problem with the moment  .
also , i have no problem with call volume  .
i do not understand why c    net is so lukewarm with this phone  .
since i traded my hero for this phone i have had no regrets at all .
i have had this phone for about three weeks now and i love it  .
one thing i just found out and learning new things about this all the time is if you go into menu settings while watching you tube there is a setting to change the video quality  .
you can change it from standard to hid and it makes a major difference in the picture resolution  .
it just looks fantastic  .
i don't know why they just do not keep it there all the time and ditch the standard viewing  .
i'll tell you another little secret  .
i had the hero before this for a month and i don t miss it at all  .
got this phone after having a hero for almost a month and very happy i switched  .
has all the bells and whistles  .
no lag  .
could not be happier  .
updated  .
on nov 17 , 2009  .
i switched to sprint from att where i previously owned an iphone , but sprint's unbeatable prices and new droid phones peaked my curiosity  .
well , after many trips to the sprint store and tons of research on the pre , hero and moment , i finally decided on the moment and i couldn't be happier  .
the hero is getting a lot of attention right now and i think it's simply due to the coolness of the phone , which if you have any sense you would lol at that  .
when you look at the hero and the moment together you can kind of see why people are leaning towards that device , but once you turn on the phones and start to navigate through the screens you will see that the functionality is very similar  .
some of the differences i found is the hero had the pinch and zoom similar to the iphone ; however , that feature may be available for the moment in the 2  .
0 release , but let me tell you that feature is vastly overrated  .
i thought it is actually going to be a deal breaker , but after using the moment for about 30 minutes i realized its zoom is just as efficient  .
another thing is the 7 screens on the hero , hahah at that , i mean seriously the 3 screens on the moment are plenty , especially considering you can create folders , which store at least 20 apps , so that is another overrated feature on the hero  .
if you're an iphone user you are nodding your head right now because the fact you do not have folders is irritating (disclaimer   i had a 3g phone , so the 3gs may have folders) .
get this phone  .
i promise you that you will not regret it  .
stay away from the htc hero  .
the hands on keyboard sucked  .
also i is the most loyal palm treo user for years but unfortunatelly the palm pre's keyboard is too small for anyone who has fat fingers like i do i hope my car tape adapter can fit into this phone so that i can listen to my sprint country music radio or pandora through my car speakers  .
(if you live in new york city (and as you know there are no country music stations there) and you actually like or love country music as much as i do well here is a free option and alternative to xm or sirius radio)  .
i see the cnet editor rated the moment bad for the following   the samsung moment's touch interface and controls were a little sluggish  .
the camera lacks editing features  .
i have to disagree all these negatives are just not true  .
maybe they reviewed a pre    release phone , and need to give it another look the response on the touch screen is the opposite of sluggish the fastest i have seen i am so happy the camera did not try to restrict or complicate its use with editing and such that would never satisfy everyone  .
the camera is a part of an android phone  .
you can use android apps to do everything you can imagine with the camera and the resulting pics  .
all i want from the camera is to just be there i will take it from there thank you very much this is the whole point of using android do not be fooled by looking at the android  .
com site i was  .
there are tons more apps available via the phone than they show on the internet sight i am like a kid in the candy store  .
there are apps for everything things you would never think of a compass , medal detector , level , stud finder , games out the kazoo , gps stuff out the kazoo , all kinds of calendars , clocks , reminder apps no point going on with the list it is truly endless if you happen to have your contacts in gmail , you will be happy to know this phone simply syncs between the two  .
this feature will probably send thousands of new gmail customers to google  .
of course gmail includes a calendar that syncs with the phone , and additional storage for documents , and a reader shesh , now i'm hawking google  .
cannot help it it really adds a whole new dimension to a phone to know everything is now automatically synced to the web ; as in back    up someone has got to build this great tool that includes a phone a longer life battery .
had a hero for 3 weeks and is sooooooooo unhappy with that phone work around after work around so to compare the 2 i'd say if you want a speedier browser , better looking screen , hardware keyboard , better batter life , a lean os get the moment if you think a pretty widget is more important than all those things then my guess is you're a mac guy and you need a hero the choice of the moment over the hero is a no brainer updated  .
on nov 5 , 2009  .
if you root it , it will come  .
with the right rom the phone can really come to life  .
this phone is so much fun to tweak and it has the power to play just about all the games i can load  .
its screen is one of the best , i watched avatar on it just to see with my itouch next to it and you can clearly see the difference  .
i use the gps daily and surf with it often never have had a problem  .
i really rely on it as it is a central part in everything i do  .
it really is a mini computer/nav/game system/media hub/everything  .
i have bought other brands of phones before and only had 2 samsung i will only buy samsung for now on  .
i have not had any problems with this phone nor my samsung rant which i still use and its 3yrs old  .
with the amount of 3rd party developers that have worked on this phone the customization is awesome you can spend weeks customizing it and after it has been rooted the possibilities are endless and the battery life goes through the roof  .
but just like any smartphone the issue with the moment is the lack of ram even tho android is made to run on less ram then say win mo a minimum of 512 megs of ram would have been a great idea coupled with the insanely fast 800mhz cpu  .
always remember your ram dictates how fast your cpu can operate  .
this device is far from garbage and it is way better than the already outdated intercept .
this is my second smart phone  .
my first the mb fried in 2 months  .
this one is awesome  .
easy simple and smart  .
this is how it's supposed to be  .
powerful phone with awesome perks and very well built  .
software issues i am sure have been fixed im just too lazy to download the new content .
this is a new android phone , which means it has access to over a million of apps and growing for fast and easy download or purchase  .
i love the customizable screen  .
the keys are nice and big  .
but gps turns on automatically and is a big battery drainer  .
but just make sure you turn it off by going to settings , my location and uncheck the gps option , and turn back on when using sprint nav and google maps  .
other than that and the weight i love it  .
i highly recommend downloading lookout antivirus which is 100% free and the subscription is $50 a month not the subscription is also free  .
a great choice for a phone  .
this phone is great  .
now with the 2  .
1 update its even better  .
the samsung moment can do everything , i have had no problems with it  .
i really have nothing bad to say about this phone except battery life but hey , for how much i use it daily i dont mind charging it every night  .
all apps load super fast , and i is surprised at how great web browsing is and how fast sprints 3g network was , on average i get 1  .
9 mbps , which is faster than some of my friends home internet  .
the music and camera functions are great and with 2  .
1 , the apps become even better  .
i just love android and how open it is compared to apple , there is so much you can change , i currently use launcher pro over the stock android ui and i even installed the htc virtual keyboard because its so much better than the stock one  .
over all this is a great phone and i would recommend it to anyone  .
obviously , this review is intended to help potential buyers who emphasize the ability to text efficiently  .
however , i want to add two side note  .
(1) many reviews state that the moment's battery life is a problem , but i have not had this issue  .
the phone comes with methods to save battery life , and when these methods are in place , my battery has lasted as long as my previous , non    touchscreen phone  .
so just follow directions (like you learned to do in 2nd grade) and you should be good  .
(2) many reviews state that the moment will disconnect calls  .
some reviews state that one's face on the touchscreen is the cause  .
however , i have not had this problem at all .
just got mine on friday  .
it's the most i have ever paid for a phone , but it is well worth it  .
great phone  .
i liked the specs on the phone , but i is pleasantly surprised with the product  .
coming from a palm treo and a blackberry , this phone suits me in both the practical and the wow factor you will like   call quality and volume , bright gorgeous display , easy navigation , pretty fast browser , pretty good menu trees  .
for those unfamiliar with apps , the app market brings you lots of tools and toys to customize your experience  .
i easily found a better contact manager , notepad app , plus media for pandora and orb you will not like   the email client (the non    gmail one)  .
if you use gmail you're set  .
if you use additional accounts (like for work , personal domain , isp) you will probably not be able to use it  .
the net is plastered with complaints  .
an open source app is available that supposedly fixes some bugs , but i had no luck with it  .
there are no other free options at this time minor item   the phone is heavy , like a treo 600/650  .
you can get used to that , but you will be shocked a few hours after carrying and using the phone  .
the weight feels fine while typing on the qwerty keyboard though  .
also , the newer android update is supposed to be coming soon  .
i hope it brings good things .
this phone is great  .
i cannot get enough of it  .
the reason i picked this phone is of the physical keyboard over only the virtual keyboard on the hero  .
the phones screen awesome  .
the size and the colors are really phenomenal  .
the phone has wifi , though i have not had a chance to use it but seems to be really fast on sprints network a lot of people complain about the battery  .
it makes sense though that if you leave apps running then your battery is going to drain  .
i multitask a bit on the phone but not for hours at a time  .
i am never just surfing the web on the phone for a period longer then 20 minutes  .
but i would assume anything more then that would start to deteriorate the battery  .
i can probably go for a good day and a half , with regular use , without charging my phone the android marketplace is awesome  .
just about everything on there is free or has a free/lite version of the app  .
apps run smoothly and are of high quality one of the biggest things that i like about this phone is the customization of the desktop (main screen for lack of a better word)  .
this way i can organize tools in one spot , contacts and email in another and games and social networking stuff in another  .
it is great have not had the chance to use the document viewer or anything of that sort so no comment on that overall this is a great phone  .
i am very satisfied and will be even more satisfied if the android 2  .
1 rumor comes true .
i've owned the iphone , plam pre , htc tilt , htc fuze and the bb curve  .
this is honestly my favorite phone so far  .
perhaps i have such a high opinion because this is my first experience with android , regardless this is a great phone  .
i have not had a problem with it yet and i've owned it for about 2 months updated  .
on jul 4 , 2010  .
this phone is a very good phone  .
you can do almost everything from it  .
its worth the money  .
i have read many reviews on the moment and i agree with some and disagree with most  .
the most common problem is that people are complaining about the battery life  .
yes , if you leave programs running in the background it will eat your battery with ease  .
solution , do your research on the os  .
android is a multitasking euphoria , it has everything iphone users want without having to exit programs to check your email  .
i have downloaded automatic task killer , it allows you to choose which programs run in the background and which stay open  .
impo there is no reason to run any app that you use frequently in the background  .
the processing power of this phone allows for quick opening of programs and save time and battery by having them closed when the screen is powered off  .
also the display plays a big part  .
if you are having your screen at 100% all day that is no good  .
being an amoled it runs much more efficient on a lower brightness and with the same brilliant results  .
i went from 7am    11pm on a single charge with moderate to heavy use  .
(ie texting , facebook , random internet surfing) not to mention that my office is in a network hell and would often go from evdo    1x back and forth  .
needless to say at the end of the day i is at 20% but that is good considering the time i had it away from the charger the only other thing i would say about the battery and how to make it work for you is not to have you gmail or twitter updated every 5 mins  .
no one gets that many personal emails that often nor tweets (because they are so crucial to social living) that you need to know when someone tweets about how bad their day is or what kinda shoes to buy the keyboard took some getting use to because of the funky layout  .
i can from a blackberry bold 9000 and it is a texting dream  .
so needless to say it has been a transition  .
but still it the key have just enough play and tactile feedback that it makes up for the layout obviously with a quirty keyboard comes added weight and bulk , which is not a big deal seeing that my bold is wider than my moment call quality is very good and i think the speaker phone performs quite well the only thing that i would change or omit would be the optical mouse  .
it works well in some applications but to me needs to be more sensitive in its response  .
also if vibrating feedback were used it would make for more precise navigation one thing i would suggest for heavy users (games , apps , fb) would be a car charger  .
the 1440mah battery charges very quickly , but if your seeing bad performance or low battery because of use it would be a good investment .
i bought my samsung moment the 2nd week it is out  .
45 days later i am on my 4th phone  .
phone #1 battery life sucked , (returned for new one)  .
phone #2 battery life still sucks but find out this is normal for moment , but my phone goes crazy with lock code and locks me out of my phone  .
come to find out there is a known flaw on this android system that has only been corrected on the verizon droid phone  .
this flaw will not allow you to do a hard reset if you enter the wrong security swipe 3 times  .
why you ask , well because there is no hard reset on the phone until now  .
oops i guess that tiny detail is overlooked , and yes this update ads a hard reset  .
so i is given a new phone  .
phone #3 every time the screen turned off my phone would not turn back on without taking out the battery  .
phone #4 had one week , zero problems yet  .
now about the freaking update  .
samsung obviously rushed to get this phone to market  .
so much so that hey have to tweak the operating system so much that an over the air update will not work  .
so guess what moment owners  .
the dreaded trip to a sprint repair store  .
be prepared folks  .
your phone will be wiped out  .
back up everything before you let the tech touch it  .
i suggest astro file manager app which is free and sync your contacts to your gmail account after an hour and half at sprint and starting all over for the 5th time to reinstall all my apps and settings this is my results  .
battery life is much improved and the phone even seems to run smoother and faster  .
other than that i have not noticed to much difference  .
good  .
i switched over to sprint entirely back in december and for the past month i've been eye balling this phone  .
i have been tempted to say screw it and add a third line to get this phone  .
i got a smokin' great deal on this phone only $36 at radioshack  .
i is tickled to death  .
i knew from the second i got this phone i'd be pleased with it  .
before i switched to sprint i had the gr500 lg xenon from at t , and that is my baby i loved that phone  .
it is quick , responsive , and twenty times better than the cool lg cu 720 shine i had before  .
and what is even better is that though it's gray , i would of liked blue or red , but it's all good , it looks almost exactly like the xenon only a little bit bigger  .
i love the android operating system , and at 800 mhz it is very responsive to touch and pressing of keys  .
it's hard to believe this phone came from sprint  .
it always reminds me of my lg xenon so much (i miss at t  tear ) i love the applications on it  .
i'm a big fan of pandora , and it was not available on my exclaim , but it is on the android operating system yay  .
they also have the find starbucks app and it has cribbage (i like my ipod touch cribbage game better , but it gets the job done  .
) it has threaded messaging (the exclaim somewhat does , but it does a poor job at it  .
) , which the xenon had and i'm a fan of i am a fan of speed , and when i use computers , i want them to be fast  .
the moment is up to par with some computers , making it a favorite  .
the fast switching between applications and the browser and calling and whatnot are outstanding  .
the battery life is rather short if you use it heavily , but i'm always near my laptop and a power outlet so charging is not a problem for me if you are looking for a stylish phone with loads of features , this is your phone  .
this is the perfect alternative for a customer who lives in a town of which there is sprint service , but not at t (kind of like the situation i'm in i roam in the small town i work in , but the wal    mart in the town of which i work in has sprint and not at t  .
) i recommend this phone to everyone  .
and the everything data everything mobile plan pricing is just right , also  .
this is a very good value , unlike verizon's plans  .
anyways peace out people  .
get this phone , you'll be glad you did  .
nate  .
i use my phone all my waking hours  .
from an alarm clock , to showing the recipe i'm making for dinner , to logging my fitness , nutrition and a myriad of other 'net things  .
i travel quite a bit and greatly appreciate solid navigation and location info , such as nearby fuel  .
i'd buy this phone again and would definitely recommend it if you're considering a smart phone .
this is a great phone  .
actually it's a non    windows ppc with phone capabilities  .
the music player started up the first time and there is no waiting to scan the sd card  .
unlike the instinct  .
i love the qwerty slider although the space bar on th bottom row of keys does take a bit of getting used to , but there is actually a row dedicated to numbers , unlike the t    mobile mda (aka htc wizard)  .
the sound is loud , actually ear    splitting if the volume is at max and you hold it near your ear  .
camera is 3  .
2 mega pixel , but threre is no provision to zoom in  .
not really a problem for me as i don't use the camera all that often  .
the things i do use it for , it excels at  .
the internet is actually usable , unlike the instint (instink , i call it)  .
you can sync your google calander and contacts to the phone and when the sync settings are set properly  .
it will actually push the contacts and apointments to your phone as you add them  .
one problem i noticed is that when i try to send a contact via bluetooth to the moment , it says content received but the contact is not listed in contacts  .
the battery life is not the greatest , but the best solution to that is to download the taskkiller app  .
that does help  .
but surfing the net does take a fair amount of juice  .
as does playing music through the speaker  .
it's better when you use headphones  .
sound wise and on the battery  .
i do have a quibble with sprint  .
this is  not  the phone's fault  .
currently you are unable to upgrade the firmware over the air  .
you have to take the device to a repair center and they will perform the flash for you  .
according to sprint , over the air updates will be here soon  .
hope they follow through with that as the device ships wih android 1  .
5 cupcake  .
do not get me wrong , cupcake is not bad , just a bit out of date  .
overall this i a  great  device  .
i love it updated  .
on feb 8 , 2010  .
a great smart phone  .
the android interface is awesome  .
the apps are great and they are adding new ones all of the time  .
being a single parent , teacher , and basketball coach , i am always on the go  .
this phone makes it easy to keep in touch and keep things organized .
i'm in marin county just north of the golden gate  .
i've had my samsung moment for a week and love it  .
will be searching the forum http  //www  .
samsungmomentforum  .
com to solve what looks like the common problem of short battery life that i'm experiencing , and get advice on apps and accessories , i also have a ce and mobile technology mktg consulting company so might be asking for your input on some future usage and technologies coming out  .
thanks for posting this .
i love this phone except for the battery life  .
i think the layout is well thought out  .
the moment does not lack any features like some other phones do  .
the key board lay out is great and easy to use where as the droid might as well not even have one for all the use it is  .
the hero has htc sense for more home screens but i use an app that gives me 7 home screens and a 3d cube effect when switching screens  .
the fact is there is an app that will do almost any thing a factory added feature can do .
i have have over 30 smart phones , just coming from a palm pre , and i love this phone  .
i am a very busy college instructor and full time student  .
i needed something to manage my tasks , calendar and email as well as easy to access contacts  .
this phone syncs seamlessly with my google apps so i can update any of these on the computer or on my phone  .
going from a palm centro to a samsung moment is like going from a kia to a cadillac  .
$179 with a two year contract is a little pricey but in my opinion it is worth it .
this phone is one of the best android phones on the market and by far sprint's best smartphone  .
i had the hero for about a week and had to return it for this phone  .
htc sense is great but the hero is severely flawed  .
this gets better battery life than the hero with a smaller battery and a faster processor  .
i love how fast it is and it will be able to handle 2  .
0 easily  .
the battery life is not great i can get through a day but it could be better and the phone only reports the battery percentage every 10%  .
i do have a task manager which helps but does not increase the battery life that much  .
hopefully this is a 1  .
5 issue and will be fixed in 2  .
0 the screen is amazing  .
it looks stunning  .
there are few phones that even come close to the moment's screen i do not understand what people are saying about the keyboard  .
i think that the key board is easy to use and better than the droid's this is a great phone and once you get used to having android's multitasking power it will be hard to use any other non    android phone .
just a fun media and business phone  .
the android market is a blast  .
through flycast app i am able to access 1 club  .
fm studio 54  .
wish i could sync to my i    tunes  .
coupled with the sprint simply everything plan , the best value out there  .
great for business , large enough screen , keyboard and does everything i want/expect , and comes with android ; there are already great business apps made for this platform and we're barely scratching surface    there are tons more in the pipelines if you're a business user who uses business analytics or business intelligence software , i highly recommend android apps made for pentaho on this phone (more of these in the works) .
it may not seem like i do but i love this phone  .
there are a little downsides but so what  .
sense ui is much better than stock android but use apps like panda home and i think u will be satisfied  .
the display , keyboard and processor are all better than the heros  .
in my opinion this phone is better than the hero by a hair and if you get either one you would be satisfied  .
take it from someone who had the hero and has the moment now  .
if you are looking for an android , this phone is definitely worth looking at  .
it feels substantial in your hand , not cheap  .
the slide action feels great with a satisfying snap back into place  .
i have not played with the camera too much but i noticed there is no zoom feature , which i can live without  .
the iphone has a plastic screen cover which just barely fits the moment's screen and i highly recommend that you get a cover or case for it , too , because the phone scratches easily on pocket change/pens be advised , you will be upgrading to sprint's everything data package which is an expensive bump up in the cell phone category of your budget  .
you've been warned .
iphone can have 100 , 000 apps  .
how many do you use at once  .
if you're on sprint , and love having a physical keyboard , this is a great phone  .
its why i didnt go for the hero the droid apps suit my every need  .
as ethel merman sang anything you can do i can do better i easily get my email    google , hotmail , etc  .
i can chat on yahoo msn , watch youtube , stream pandora radio , etc  .
800mhz processor , amoled screen is very bright vivid  .
so far i think android phones will give an iphone a run for their money updated  .
on jun 18 , 2010  .
i only had this for a few days , but man what a phone , i love the fact that you have the slide out keypad as well as the touch screen keypad  .
in fact this is what bummed me on the palm pre  .
the phone is very responsive and applications load fast did i mention the screen  .
you gotta see that screen .
bottom line this phone is well worth the price  .
my wife has the hero and complains about the keyboard and not having a flash , and this phone has that taken care of  .
it is easy to use and has countless features that will make it hard to put it down .
very happy with the phone and service  .
best bang for the buck and the amount of features/functions is impressive  .
the display and performance are amazing too .
just a fabulous device after having the hero for a few weeks i really do not regret my switch  .
anyone experiencing poor battery life just download task manager from android market and put a stop to all the running programs  .
works like a charm  .
i have been using two days and finally needs a charge  .
i cannot put it down  .

i had the hero right before this phone for three weeks and i have to tell you besides the ui , this phone has that one beat in just about every thing and especially performance  .
i really got tired of making mistakes on that keyboard and the lag irritated me  .
i actually like the virtual keyboard better on this than the hero  .
but the physical keyboard is a night and day difference i also had the iphone 3gs and several others and to compare but this phone just won me over  .
now the ui is very basic but i am the type that likes to build and design my own ui and not what someone else already stuck in there  .
when 2  .
0 comes out and this gets it , that will be something really look forward to  .
i cannot believe some of the reviews i read from some of the review sights  .
it almost made me not get this phone  .
i am glad that i had to see for myself with all the great specs this phone has i could not just not try it  .
but i am glad i did and i think you will too if you have some tech smarts in you updated  .
on nov 10 , 2009  .
this is the phone i've been waiting for  .
i'm probably in the minority , but i actually prefer the base android interface to htc's sense ui  .
combined with the physical keyboard , it made my choice of a sprint android phone pretty easy  .
i do wish it had android 2  .
0 (after all , the moto droid is launching on verizon in a matter of days packed with 2  .
0) , but i've been told it the upgrade is coming in a matter of a few months  .
in general though , i could not be happier  .
nice job samsung  .
i don't know what they are talking about in this review , but the sound quality and volume on my device is absolutly booming  .
other reviews on other sites same the same , so i suspect that somehow cnet got their hands on a dud volume wise  .
i put android 1  .
5 as a negative , only because it is a bit older , but if you aren't used to smartphone or coming from wm like me , you will love it  .
also , it most likely is getting a 2  .
0 upgrade anyway  .
as for the stock build , i like this  .
there are 10 , 000 apps and growing in the store , and many options to download customized home screens  .
why does it have to be a knock on a device that was not customized , when the operating system is specifically built for 3rd party development  .
another thing is lag or sluggishness of the screen  .
i have not experienced this at all , but to be fair they did state that android virgins would not notice this .
my main gripe about this phone is that it has the stock with google experience ui while it could've really turned heads if it had the touchwiz ui  .
the stock ui may turn some towards other devices and if there are those of you that will overlook this phone just because it has stock android i implore you to look at some of the home replacement apps like open home , a home and others and you'll probably be able to pick your own custom home screen that will make your own individual phone stand out in a crowd another gripe i have about it is the joystick  .
i just do not see how that would be better than a trackball and is probably put on to make the phone's cosmetics better  .
i plan on playing games on my phone and the way the joystick works just seems like it would hinder some games functionality  .
maybe someone could prove me wrong about this the samsung moment as of this time is the fastest android device in the market with its 800 mhz processor  .
this alone will probably make the phone glide through screen changes and handle plenty of running apps while it may not have the highest mp camera , it has 3  .
2 while the hero has 5 , it makes up for it with the flash  .
the amoled display will absolutely mesmerize you with its good looks and how it never fades out when you tilt the phone  .
however , i am willing to overlook this because of the many home replacement apps in the market that can remedy this  .
heck , if you were really savvy you could port the hero's sense ui onto the moment turning it into the best phone on the market including against the iphone in my opinion potentially sprint's own applications can really make or break this phone  .
with sprint tv , sprint navigation , nascar and nfl mobile on the phone it can really transform it into something special  .
if it looks and runs like the hero then the phone will have a huge advantage over non sprint devices  .
all in all this is a great phone and if the people who buy it fully know the powers of android , this phone will beat anything on the market .
i absolutely love the samung moment  .
its like a mini laptop that you carry around in your purse  .
and to the people who were saying the battery life stinks , well it's going to if you have it in your hands playing on it all day  .
but this really is a nice phone  .
it is quite bulky and it will freeze up from time to time but the product itself is great  .
i've had this phone for 4 months and nothing bad happened (well not yet) and also to the people that were saying not to get the phone , it is not a bad phone , it is to some people probably because they think the phone is not for them  .
and i think that is why they are posting it all over the internet i have not had to send my phone in one , and about the battery , as soon as it goes dead , before you got o sleep just plug it up  .
then when you wake up your good to go  .
but i only wrote this review to tell you that this phone is not bad at all , it probably is for some people because they are quite ready for a phone like this one  .
~awesome phone~   .
i love it and hate it , but i love it more .
this device is amazing only problems i found were the battery life and the size  .
the battery life is not as bad as everybody says , its only if you're on the internet all the time , which you still get 5    6 hours being on the internet constantly the sound is great and it has so many features  .
it can be overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it , it's pretty easy to use  .
wonderful phone   )  .
updated  .
on jul 19 , 2010  .
so far , very pleased , upgraded from rumor (had for 5 years) pleased with sprint been with them for years .
i still chose it over the hero because of the flash and keyboard , but the hero has more home screens , multi touch (although still nowhere near as nice as the pre or iphone) , and a much better ui  .
i would give it a 5 star rating if it had the 2  .
1 update and multi touch as good as the pre or iphone  .
i want to root it to get rid of all the sprint crap that's loaded on it though .
a lot of people have had complaints on battery life  .
i either got lucky or they are leaving gps and wifi on at all times  .
i can use my phone pretty extensively (games , web browsing , texting , etc  .
) and have it last the whole day without any trouble  .
without extensive use the phone will last 2 days  .
the display is great and so is the physical keyboard  .
if you do not care about the keyboard then the hero would probably be a good choice  .
powerful hardware and the android platform while outdated has everything you need  .
but for me , sprint's data plan is what should sell this phone  .
if you want unlimited texting prepare to pay $30 more a month for the droid for the exact same service and essentially the same phone with a worse physical keyboard but a newer version of android  .
i still think the iphone is better overall in terms of seamless integration of hardware and software and has a way better app store , but for me it was not even close to being worth the extra $20 a month  .
and once again iphone lacks physical keyboard but i realize that's a matter of personal preference  .
i tried out the palm pre which has a very nice os but the phone feels cheap and the keyboard is so small it defeats the purpose of a physical keyboard  .
it's app store lags behind even androids as well  .
not familiar with the blackberry line so cannot comment there .
this is an awesome phone which is very customizable  .
i like the fact that there are numorous free apps for download in the android market  .
the slide out keyboard is also a plus , but i do find myself using the onscreen keyboard more and more often  .
i've heard issues of battery life , but so far i've been satisfied with how long it lasts  .
i do agree and recommend though charging the phone nightly updated  .
on mar 10 , 2010  .
upgraded from a blackberry curve and could not be happier .
it's only my first day of having the moment but after weeks of deliberation (between hero , pre , moment and blackberry) i have made my decision and i have to say i am very happy (so far)  .
love the beautiful bright screen , the backlit keyboard , the quick buttons (back , home , menu) and especially how fast it is  .
i use my phone mostly for texting and web  .
i have a feeling this phone will open up the door to so much more  .
came from the palm centro , which is a great phone , but since i is used to keyboard and touch screen , i could not give either up  .
i have heard very good things about the android op system , so i know i was not going to go wrong with it  .
at day one , i am very happy   ) will keep you posted  .
thanks to all for your reviews and helping me make my decision .
perfect for people who can set up the phone and customize it to their liking , takes time  .
i took the time and it really is your phone  .
coming from an iphone the customization is unbelievable  .
you can completely change the homes screen  .
the only thing i do not like is the missing voice search , that samsung removed , terrible .
well one of the fist things i noticed is i had to go onto market and get a backup program this is not a good thing  .
it should come with one  .
also you cannot outright delete some things like an email account without a reset  .
had to go to market again to get a program to toggle security settings because there is no way to go back to default after you draw your pattern in security  .
not enough system memory when you have to get programs just for basic functions like backup , toggling security and silent mode  .
i don't care about pic editing because i can download an app for that  .
it's a phone after all not a camera and i can upload the pics to my pc if i need to , but i put picture editing in the non    essential category  .
i think the lack of a back up app and the ability to create a restore point is big  .
you need one or the other , preferably both and having to download them means you use internal memory space  .
it also does not follow links in emails very well i do however really enjoy the phone .
this is great phone that can meet the gadget    guy/gal's needs easily  .
i would highly recommend this phone to new sprint users and even others that want to switch carriers  .
i came over to sprint from verizon due to everything plan and with this phone it did not disappoint .
honestly , iv researched android phones for the longest time  .
iphone is good , but only because its been there for a while but honestly , customization wise , the iphone blows  .
if you want a phone that you can have fun with , make it your own , and brag about , the moment is the way too go  .
sense ui on the hero is over rated and the 7 screens arent necessary  .
i thought i might be able to deal with the onscreen keyboard , but it gets really annoying at times especially during long texts or emails , i find the physical keyboard is very handy the flash on the camera is great , that the hero definitely def doesnt have its a little bulky , but not bad at all , i think the size is great again the display is amazing iv read through forums and forums and iv concluded on the moment  .
new androids are coming out soon , but i dont think any of them have a nice physical keyboard too  .
if u want a slim phone that isnt as fast as the moment and u just want something flashy flashy flashy , go for the hero  .
it will be slower , die quicker and lag more , but hey it looks sleek and if you are cool with a worse on screen keyboard , go for it  .
iphone cant compete with android  .
my friend has the iphone and he says android is better  .
worth every dollar  .
my only real complaint about this phone is the battery life  .
i run an app manager and a task killer and still only get about 8 hours of playtime on the phone before having to recharge  .
problem is when you get down to 15% , you cannot use the camera and then it auto dims which makes it virtually impossible to see when out in bright light  .
i am considering buying another battery just to have a spare and also one with better rating (the one installed is 1440 mah , have seen one rated at 1600mah)  .
the apps are great and plentiful , i love the features and the sound quality is excellent imho  .
i use a bluetooth most of the time but the phone volume is very good and the speaker phone is great but you have to remember it is behind the phone so do not set it on a table or blanket and you can hear it fine  .
another pet peeve right now is the lack of accessories , i have had my phone almost 2 months now and still there are no designated moment accessories except for a few shells to clamp on  .
the iphone has about 10 , 000 accessories , why so few for the moment  .
anyway , i love the slide out keyboard since my wife has a instinct s30 i tried to use the touch pad and it is difficult  .
the keyboard is small but even with my fat fingers i can type relatively fast  .
also , just a warning , if considering the invisishield , please know i is so elated they had one for the moment i installed it and then realized how much it affects the touch screen usage  .
gets frustrating sometimes , i would recommend against it if you plan to use the touch screen a lot (ie to play games , etc)  .
overall , this is a great phone with a few little quirks .
this is my first touch phone and data phone  .
i ushered in the 21st century by upgrading to sprints data package and after an extensive investigation on different phones i decided on the samsung moment  .
the pull out keyboard is the only way to go as it makes typing very easy  .
i'm a fast typer so being able to type with a finger from each hand on this phone makes quick work at typing messages  .
the rotating screen is very i    phone like  .
it is thicker than an i    phone but handling the moment is not bad given i have small hands  .
i would recommend buying the phone through sprint as i believe you are more likely to get a new phone with all the updates right off  .
i've only had the phone a week but time will tell how good the phone really is .
if you don't mind experimenting with apps to find the ones that suit you best , this phone is superb  .
(i'm trying to find the best to    do list , for example   gtasks , astrid , rtm all have their pluses and minuses  .
) the keyboard is great       i can almost , but not quite , see how people live without a physical keyboard  .
the drawback in having a keyboard is extra girth , of course , and this phone is a biggish wedge in the pocket  .
(i can type well using the onscreen keyboard in landscape mode , but then there's almost no screen available  .
) it's good    looking , though android 1  .
5 seems just fine to me , though i'm looking forward to the update  .
i don't see any holes in the app store offerings  .
(something people do not mention is that android apps are mostly free right now , unlike iphone apps       maybe that's in hopes the os will catch on  .
i gather samsung is updating the lock screen , because the current one makes it too easy to dial 911  .
(you'll see why if you look at one  .
) i'm using a lock app in the meantime , but it's inconsistent you should consult an android site for tips on conserving the battery  .
following those , i get a solid day out of it i is unable to figure out how to manually load music in so that albums would be recognized as albums (especially with classical music) , but the free doubletwist program solves that , if you use playlists i like the money you save with sprint and have not had problems with their service in the past ; this is the best sprint phone , i think .
the moment is basically sprint's equivalent of verizon's droid  .
the form factor and most of the features are very comparable  .
voice and sound quality are very good  .
the speakerphone is very loud and works with the media player so the moment can act as a sort of portable radio  .
coupled with an app like iheartradio , this is a killer app for me  .
especially like the gps app    plug it into an fm modulator and suddenly your car speakers are the gps voice  .
also works very well for playing media or streaming internet radio in the car (no more local radio and no satellite fees  .
) and if a call comes in , the music pauses and lets you take the call  .
the camera is very good in low light  .
wish it had manual zoom  .
the moment runs os 1  .
5 which is no longer the latest thing  .
but sprint is promising to bring out updates to bring it up to the current release  .
that should solve many of the issues like the battery meter i've been experimenting lately with leaving my laptop at home and just seeing if i can rely on the moment , and for the most part , it has been easy  .
also been able to leave my gps at home and just rely on the gps app in the phone  .
this works very well  .
when you want to find a place , the phone looks it up online to find the address and then does the routing  .
this is effectively like having live updated maps  .
compare to static gpss which often do not have poi or the latest streets  .
no wonder the gps companies are scared .
i've had the moment since christmas , and so far i have only found a few flaws  .
because i have internet on my phone for now , the phone tends to die quickly  .
i can make it about 18 hours without a charge  .
this actually is not too bad , i'm just used to my lg rumor lasting 3 days on one charge  .
the other flaw is that applications , like the internet and games , sometimes crash without warning  .
the phone is easy to figure out  .
the camera takes decent quality pictures  .
my texts go through and the call quality is very good  .
overall , i love the phone .
great phone sicker than the iphone battery life sucks but overall the phone is not that bad  .
big fan of android and it may take a while to convert me to something else .
if the battery were able to hold a longer charge , i would have absolutely zero complaints with this phone .
after two weeks of use compared it with hero (tested one week)  .
the dust accumulation on the hero screen is a deal breaker for me  .
the screen in sharper than the hero but i would expect better battery life given the amoled screen , although battery life on the hero is just as bad  .
glad to have the keyboard because my flat    tip fingers were just bad for vertical virtual keyboard , horizontal is a bit better but takes getting used to it  .
reception issues inside home is resolved by retentions dept at sprint providing me a free airave with no monthly fee , at home i use wi    fi  .
call quality is very good , loud and clear , speakerphone much better than hero  .
picture quality is good but the shutter button is extremely slow , image stabilization feature would be nice  .
although hero has 5mp camera the moment's pics looked better  .
user interface in hero is much nicer but i have learned to customize moment's screens and i came to conclusion that i can have everything i really use in 3 screens  .
most of these new smartphones do very poorly in terms of battery life and both htc hero and samsung moment add to this list  .
the moment has some glitches in power management that are a bit annoying and here are examples  .
after reading reviews i went through 3    4 cycles of fully charging/discharging phone and not much difference is noticed because battery indicator is crazy estimating battery life  .
after a few hours of normal use (4    5 hrs) the battery meter suddenly drops to indicate 15% and screen in dimmed  .
it remains at 15% for the next 3    4 hrs before going into red indicating less than 15%  .
at this point you cannot use certain energy hungry devices such as camera/camcorder  .
in another instance i is charging phone through usb cable and when i took it off it kept indicating that it is charging  .
problem is that phone is not managing energy use at this point and towards the end of the day it just indicated battery low , phone shutdown and i is left without communication at that point  .
hopefully these glitches will be resolved in the next software update (please  .
so why in the world would i keep this phone  .
well honestly sprint has been very supportive (unbelievable right  .
) , have addressed all my main concerns of home reception (out of home phone works great) , sprint tv keeps kids (and adults) entertained , sprint navigation is excellent , watched nfl network game last thu (an otherwise $10 add    on to my cable bill) and the android platform is awesome , so i only had to choose between hero and moment  .
although i use phone with one hand , i found the keyboard easier to use than virtual one , although the hero virtual keyboard is a bit better than the moment's  .
the moment is faster than the hero (much less lag) , the amoled screen is far better than the hero lcd , especially viewing angle (when both kids want to see spongebob on sprint tv impossible in the hero)  .
but the choice is clear when i confirmed the fact that the hero does tend to accumulate dust on the corners inside the screen hero needs very special care to prevent this  .
i got used to the bulkier phone type (stepping up from a centro) although i still try to reach for a stylus at times (hardest habit to break)  .
just wish these phones would either allow install of apps into sd card or have larger memory space to install these  .
overall i like the moment on sprint's network  .
highly recommend this phone , put my blackberry down for this one where blackberry cannot touch this phone in many ways  .
this is my first smartphone  .
i set my metropcs samsung messager aside  .
however , i'm a fan of how samsung phones are built  .
they are strong and durable  .
i am also a fan of the touchscreen response  .
according to the cnet review , they said it is sometime unresponsive  .
but , i think it's a good thing to put some pressure when opening an icon or flipping pages  .
some phones open apps if you breathe on them  .
i like the the slide    out keyboard feature , and it having 4 rows (dedicated numbers row) vs 3 rows , is part of the reason i chose this phone over the motorola cliq  .
i do wish it is easier to zoom  .
maybe i need to read the manual  .
lol , but besides that i think it's a great phone  .
not an iphone competitor , but a solid phone for anyone looking to get into the smartphone game .
i'm really happy with this phone  .
i think its one of the best phones on the market right now , and i do not think you'll regret getting it  .
for me the biggest probs   wish the battery lasted longer and i wish i could find a better tethering solution (this will probably be fixed in time) .
alright , i have to get this out of the way first  .
the whole battery issue thing  .
the battery in this phones borders on stellar  .
it would get at least 4 out of 5 stars  .
i know there are many people out there complaining about it  .
there is nothing wrong with the battery  .
there is , however  .
something wrong with the battery meter on the phone  .
i would imagine it is a software issue  .
what happens is that the battery meter will show a relatively rapid decrease/discharge in the battery  .
you will be down around 15% by the late afternon  .
but you can operate the phone below 15% for hours on end  .
i challenge anybody with this phone to try to run it until it turns off/dies  .
you will be awake all night trying i guarantee you  .
is this an issue  .
yes it is  .
it would be nice to have an accurate reading of actual battery life remaining  .
another annoyance associated with this is that once the battery does go below 15% , the screen goes into a power saving made and automatically dims and you cannot brighten it until you recharge  .
so the people that freak out when it says you have 15% remaining don't  .
you still have literally hours of use potentially well into the next day if used lightly  .
if you would like to read a 10 page thread on this issue , visit this website (i have no interest) http  //androidforums  .
com/samsung    moment/13783    possible    battery    quirk  .
html  .
that link will give the potential buyer of this phone something to go on instead of just the battery sucks another issue is pandora does not run smoothly on this phone  .
may have something to do with the buffer setting or the sampling speed but this is also a known issue  .
i am willing to bet this will get worked out because this is probably the second biggest issue next to the battery meter  .
people love their pandora good stuff   best thing about this phone is the speed  .
i had the hero for 3 weeks and that phone absolutely drove me crazy  .
you would have to wait about a second for each touch to register  .
the hero fans will say , gosh , you sure are impatient if you cannot spare a second  .
it is a second per touch  .
so if you have to go thru menus that require 10 selections , you are there for at least 10 seconds  .
this phone is just pop pop pop pop you can probably navogate that same menu in half the time and maybe even a third of the time on the moment  .
the phone app on that phone (hero) is so slow and laggy  .
for people that are looking for a good telephoning eperience this phone is the best cellphone i have ever used  .
speaker volume (both interior and exterior) is excellent  .
call quality is excellent  .
and i have yet to drop a call which is unheard of  .
i am sure it will happen , but i am still amazed  .
it is an excellent phone  .
it is an above average internet device  .
the native browser is decent and faster than any other native browser i have ever seen  .
opera mini is not yet supported on this phone  .
so that is a bit of a disappointment i do not use my phone as a business tool so take all of that into consideration when you weigh my opinion so i really don't care much about syncing issues that others have had  .
google is definitely trying to bring you into their loop  .
they are a forced to be reckoned with , that is for sure i have found the virtual keyboard to be excellent as well  .
i don't really use the hard keyboard much which surprises me  .
the virtual keyboard looks very plain and the size and look of the keys do not inspire confidence at all  .
but when you go to typing , you hit all the correct keys somehow  .
anyway , i am surprised at how well it works in summary , if you are looking for a phone on the sprint network and are considering this one , i wouldn't let the battery meter issue turn you away  .
it is somewhat of an annoyance , but the phone will last you at least a whole day of regular use  .
there is a lot of noise out there about this and i don't think samsung can turn a deaf ear to it  .
i would be willing to bet it will be fixed before xmas but that is just a wag  .
this is the best offering sprint has and it ai not too shabby  .
ok here we go as objective as i can be , up front and honest i gave it 4 stars because its a good phone , but i will list the things that i personally did not like and have motivated me to get a pre i have been a long time palm person and went out to buy the pre recently and walked out with the moment  .
im open minded and always willing to try something new this is my first android and right off the bat i gotta admit i didnt like the mandatory gmail account you have to get , and the constant syncing notifications that never stop popping up  .
i think it is great that you can work with gmail if you want to , i just dont use gmail and dont want to have to switch everything up , but still a great feature if that doesnt bother you but everytime you go to add something to the calendar be prepared for continual screens to pop up confirming your sync that got old real fast , and it seems as though the preferences just dont provide enough choices for how to customize your experience ( i could care less at this point about customizing the look , just want to have control over the experience) screen is great , in the dark or low light i read a bunch of stuff saying this new screen the moment has is amazing , which it is , but when they say its great outside , thats bs my crappy palm centro is waaay better in direct sunlight i had real difficulty seeing anything outside or in the car big downer the keys on the keyboard are awkward as well (although this can be overcome by simply getting used to it) in order to get the dedicated number row , they had to get creative not my preference but oh well i like the security feature of drawing the little design , actually i love that feature however i dialed 911 emergency four times by accident , luckily i is aware and hung up before call went through , but this shouldnt be such an easy accident the 911 button is right next to where u are doodling your design to unlock phone not a well thought out situation i also didnt like the fact that you had to download an app just to effectively close your other apps shutting down an app is a hassle without it , and if you leave them running your batt life is horrible very weird how after i killed all my apps , and put the phone down for 3 hours , when i picked it back up and checked the app killer screen , a half a dozen apps had started up and were running on their own  .
that is a huge turn off if you like to use 1 hand this is not the phone for you  .
very heavy making 2 hands a must even when texting with 2 hands it felt very top heavy and is constantly feeling as if it is about to magically fall from my hands  .
i did like the fact that there are truely limitless apps out there to get the speakerphone and sound were loud which i like loved the feature that dims the screen when talking on the phone so ur face doesnt hang up on somebody or answer the call waiting after treos and the centro this feature had me seeing heart shaped candy lol great idea the internet is amazing super fast , google maps is fast and accurate the navigation is great some cool stuff didnt like that there is no multi touch for increasing screen magnification as far as video quality i went to youtube with this phone and the palm pre put them side by side loaded the same video (in the moment you have to manually select high defintion otherwise youtube default is blurry) and watched the video the moment is a smoother image , with the pixels very very subtly being visible on the pre but the screen size almost identical , the the pre is brighter both in contrast and color not something you hear by reading reviews even the guy in the sprint store came over to see what i is up to and he is shocked overall , my issues are small , but they added up to me not liking the phone oh , and everybody is hating on the phone's battery life just be smart with how you use it people and be sure to get the 3rd party app killer  .
i received my moment a day before it's official release and i must say it is a great phone  .
i have handled the phone for approx 9 hours now and i am getting used to it  .
first , i must state that this phone has a blazing internet connection and download speed  .
the browser supports video and full pages instead of , the mobile view  .
i have downloaded as many as 5 android apps at one time w/ no disruption in connection or download speed  .
the full keyboard is easier to use instead of the on screen keyboard  .
i would recommend downloading handcent in order to take full advantage of texting capabilities  .
the battery life is pretty good considering the applications i accessed  .
for example , on a full charge i is able to surf the web , download apps and talk on the phone for 9 hours before the battery got exteremely low  .
i do not like the fact that the bluetooth feature has a countdown of 2 mins before the device is not visible anymore  .
as a result , you have to restart the timer in order to make the phone visible again  .
the phone has visual voicemail which is a plus  .
the phone comes loaded with its fair share of android apps such as , facebook  .
however , there are plenty of free ones available i wish you could customize each screen with a different background however , you are able to customize the background with one picture  .
i also wish the quick button for texting is available on the home screen  .
i'm suite sure there is a way to do so but like i said i have the phone for 9 hours i will report again after a day or two with updated information .
great  .
i have to point out a typo in the review though  .
a single song costs about 89 cnets cnet must not be worth that much then .
apparently my phone is not flawed like some others are  .
it has never kicked into airplane mode , never lags , and reception is amazing  .
some of my college classes are in a basement and i am the only person out of hundreds that get reception down there  .
people are shocked i can use any phone down there it is super quick    i can search the web and get a result faster than my friend's iphone  .
the battery life is fine too  .
i have to charge it every night or every other night  .
you just get the app called app killer and i randomly hit it throughout the day and it will kill all the apps that obnoxiously run in the background  .
when a bunch of apps are not running the battery life is pretty average running navigation does kill the battery super fast but thats why they invented car chargers   )  .
the only complaint i have is that whenever i am talking on the phone my ear or face make the phone do random crap  .
the other day i took the phone away from my ear (i is just making a phone call) and there is a foot ball game playing  .
i have tried every setting and no matter what or how and where i hold it , it dials numbers , opens apps , surfs the web , etc  .
when i try to make a phone call  .
i usually now just hold it an inch away from my face which is annoying as no one can here me then  .
i have a baby and would love to be able to talk on it with no hands (use my shoulder and ear to hold it) but it i do that i'll end up deleting my call log or something with my ear other than that (which is really obnoxious i must say) my particular phone is perfect  .
this is a high    quality android phone  .
i like the keyboard on other phones more , but overall the phone is very functional , and does everything i want it to .
this is a very very good phone  .
i have purchased just about every hot phone out there , palm pre , blackberry storm 2 , droid , blackberry bold and the 9700 and the iphone  .
if you can get past the weight of the phone and the space bar on the keyboard , this phone has it all , just wished it had a 5 mp camera  .
this phone really shines with the 2  .
0 update , my only complaint i wished it had more than three screens especially with all of the widgets  .
if you can get good coverage with sprint in your city it's the network to have  .
the have the best plans in price by far and will be dropping at t as soon as evo comes out  .
this phone does everything well , there is no major flaws in the phone except for the weight .
overall this is a beautiful phone , the goods outweigh the bad's however the bad's are definitely need more discussion    .
applications start on their own , draining battery life (i wish someone would develop an app that prevents them from starting up without your approval)    although some people have stated the phone goes into a screen off mode when you are using it as a phone to your ear i have not noticed that and i have had calls drop or answered calls that were coming in without trying to or had it randomly dial on me all without pressing a button    i have yet to get more than 3 bars on my phone which is sad considering cricket had better reception and when you put a case on the phone it gets so bad it some times wont get any reception at all  .
i live in a main city so this should not be happening updated  .
on apr 6 , 2010  .
this is my first smartphone purchase , and as such , i love it       however i did some thorough research via friends who have other phones  .
i use e    mail heavily for work , but this phone is not a replacement for say , a blackberry for those who are work task    oriented  .
i am able to text and e    mail very effectively , but for me this phone will remain for personal use as i cannot connect to the corporate e    mail server without going through my company's it team (a fact for most smartphones       just throwing it out there for those who may be searching for something for work alone)  .
thankfully , the browser is so great that i am easily able to access a fully    functional version of our e    mail web portal  .
i much prefer it from a texting/productivity standpoint to the iphone due to the presence of the physical keyboard  .
it's a great compromise between the two the load times are blazingly fast  .
i have yet to use wifi on this phone for any extended period of time , simply because entire websites load within a few seconds even when outside 3g coverage it's a heavy phone , which is not a turn    off for me  .
its sturdiness is a definite selling    point the keyboard is quite nice , my only nitpicks are that the keys are a bit 'far' from one another (compared with the droid itself where the keys are perfectly flush with one another) and thus smaller than you might expect  .
from a personal standpoint , the buttons could use a more satisfying 'click' as half the time i feel like i'm having to press too hard , slowing the typing process  .
i'm a girl with smallish hands , and could imagine that someone with bigger fingers may have problems between this and the small key size there is some interface lag , primarily when bringing the phone out of hibernate mode       for example the touchscreen will sometimes become unresponsive when my alarm goes off in the morning       minor annoyance as i'm trying to turn the alarm off  .
aim and browser applications (facebook) sometimes hang for a couple of seconds when the phone landscapes/rotates after coming out of hibernate (i have it set to automatically do so without waiting for the keyboard slider , so turning that off would probably eliminate this) , as you can somewhat expect i do run a task killer application to manage things  .
it seems almost required to keep things from remaining open and running while you aren't using them (as in , there is no explicit 'exit' menu option available for them)  .
that's an android thing , really as mentioned by others , battery life meter is unreliable       i keep mine plugged in whenever i'm near an outlet , don't plan to be able to use the phone for browsing/apps for several hours without charging one glaring thing which i'm hoping will be fixed with a firmware update       as of the time of this interview (march 2010) there is a huge error when wifi is enabled that will force the phone into airplane mode seemingly at random  .
it seems to happen (according to error log dumps) when transitioning either in/out of wifi signals or 3g coverage range  .
what this means is that you could be in the middle of a call , and suddenly lose all signal  .
the phone hangs for a bit , attempting to terminate the call (~10 minutes)  .
if you don't immediately pull the battery (a hard reset does not work) , you will see that airplane mode has come on , but you are unable to turn it of and therefore have to pull the battery anyway       pretty counterproductive if you are making an emergency call  .
the solution is to turn wifi off unless you know you're within range of a reliable signal  .
for the casual user the 3g data speeds are sufficient , but if you're planning to browse and download hardcore , you'll need to be vigilant about this until it is fixed despite this errata , i am very happy with this phone since , as said , i do not find myself needing to use wifi all that often , but i can understand if that's a dealbreaker for smartphone buffs .
evrything about the phone is great  .
but the battery is so bad i had to return it for the htc hero hopefully that has better life  .
dont but unless next to a charger all the time .
i just got this phone as a replacement for the touch pro 2 (read my review on that phone to find out why)  .
overall i like the phone  .
display is very vivid , and android is significantly better than windows mobile  .
i want to detail a few dislikes , but don't get the impression they outweigh my overall favorable view of this phone because they don't  .
to me though they're significant issues that i haven't seen anyone else dicuss , so here goes first , because it's android , sprint wireless backup doesn't work if you're subscribed  .
for other phones , wireless backup (a feature for $2/month that saves your phone contacts online for easy export and backup) automatically populates a new phone with your contacts once you activate it    saving the hassle of going to a sprint store  .
with this phone however , that doesn't work so you're forced to go to the store now , the way the contacts work in terms of syncing with e    mail is that they only sync to gmail    not outlook  .
i'll digress and tell you how to get them from outlook to gmail    in outlook export all your contacts as a windows csv file (creates a spreadsheet file of your contacts)  .
in gmail you can import the csv file and you will see your contacts appear  .
when you set up your syncing feature on the phone , it will automatically retrieve all your contacts and populate your phone but (can you sense my first dislike coming  .
google does this bs thing with their contact syncing in gmail where if you 'un    sync' your device , all of your sync'd contacts disappear  .
meaning    contacts that are in your phone through gmail syncing are only there as long as there is syncing that's active  .
i don't like the fact that my contacts aren't 'hard    saved' to the phone , and as of yet , my understanding is that there's no work    around    undoubtedly a weasel tactic by google to force perpetual interaction with their service  .
i'm assuming that contacts you manually enter in the phone are saved , but keep in mind that when you're sync'd , everything you do either in the phone or in your gmail affects the other  .
you may not want certain contacts you enter to populate your gmail list , but they will anyway my second peeve is the battery life    which is horrendous  .
it seems like simply looking at the phone funny causes a 40% reduction before you know it  .
there are a few patches i've read about (like turning off the gps sensor and weather app) , but they're only fingers in the   (no pun intended san franciscans)  .
it allegedly has 4 or 5 hours of talk time , but i find that hard to believe  .
this is seriously a horrendous oversight , and they should have reverse    engineered a blackberry to find out how to make a battery that can take the daily abuses of a power user final quirk is the on    screen keyboard    not it's functionality (it's awkward , but responsive)    but certain occassions when it won't appear  .
first , and worst , is when you go to your contacts  .
on a normal phone , you type the first few letters of the person's name and the phone jumps to contacts beginning with those letters , making selection a quick process  .
but    in this case , the damn on    screen keyboard doesn't even appear  .
you're forced to scroll through all , or slide the keyboard open , switch it to horizontal , find the contact , then close the phone and dial  .
this is a big flaw which they need to fix  .
there's one more situation i found that an on    screen keyboard appearance would be nice , but doesn't happen but i forgot  .
anyway , you get the picture finally , if you're not already with sprint , don't start now    they seriously ssssuuuccckkk    do not have enough hours in the day to tell you the problems i've had  .
but , if you're stuck with them for the time being like me , you should generally be happy with this phone updated  .
on dec 4 , 2009  .
great phone , but gets no where near the battery time of 5  .
5 hours of talking , by any means .
the best thing about this phone is all of its features fron the qwerty keyboard , to the apps , and direct emails to the phone  .
even though some of the apps are useful , there is much less of a selection compared to that of the iphone  .
i do not like that sometimes i see that i have a low signal or my phone begins roaming and as soon as i restart the phone i have full signal .
for the $45 i paid for the phone , and my inexpensive $69 (which after taxes comes out to about $80) plan  .
the moment is a nice phone for the money , i would like to later switch to the htc evo , which is much more expensive the one thing i don't like about sprint in general is their service  .
although sprint has the cheapest everything data plan , verizon (of which i switched to sprint from) has the best service in my area , unfortunately verizon has to be the most expensive another problem i've been having with my moment is the usb connection to my pc  .
i live in a rural area where the phone company doesn't offer high speed internet so i downloaded pdanet from the android market and tether my moment's internet connection (which in order to get any at all i have to place my phone on the windowsill) and i get my internet that way  .
it's basically like having dial    up  .
to get to what i'm trying to explain is , sometimes my usb connection will cut out even though my usb is still plugged in  .
i've tried making sure the plugs were securely in the slots and everything , and it continues to do it even when i have full service  .
i cannot tell if it's my phone or my usb cable has a loose wire other than those problems , i love my moment and i've dropped it a few times without cracking the glass touchscreen (and hopefully that wo not happen)  .
phone #2   touch screen is losing sensitivity  .
when i click on messaging and weather opens (both by desktop icon and by start menu)  .
the sensor (to turn off touch screen when on a call) does not work i end up hanging up on people , muting them , or putting them on speaker phone  .
my notification of text messages stopped working within the last week , and the app i downloaded has stopped as well  .
email is no longer being pushed from my yahoo account to the phone (i have to manually go in and retrieve the emails) over all , i give this phone 3 stars because it is an amazing phone  .
ve had two duds , but hope three  .
s a charm  .
m waiting for sprint to drop    ship it to me perks of this phone   amazing free droid apps to be downloaded  .
the  .
base model  .
(as it ships) has some things to be desired (text notification consists of putting an icon on the task bar no notification sounds , no flashing signs , etc)  .
but again , the apps totally make up for what  .
s it lacking .
if the phone had better battery life , the phone would be almost perfect .
as stated above i am a proud owner of a tom tom rider 2nd edition motorcycle gps which is also a cellphone with a motorcycle helmet bluetooth that came from the factory committed together , i later purchased this samsung moment phone from sprint and is advised that the device would work with the gps , well it does but in the process it cancels out the gps capabilities making only one device operation at a time  .
this defeats the purpose of having a gps with bluetooth which gives me turn by turn directions via speakers in my helmet and a samsung moment phone that's bluetooth capable also  .
they both will not compliment each other  .
one cancels out the other and the operator has to pull the motorcycle over in order to pair one of the two to work  .
can you all develop along with tom tom an application that would get the job done and remedy this very inconvienient problem  .
thanks for your attention in this matter .
you would be better off with the htc hero  .
samsung did not integrate much software into the phone , and the little software they did integrate spikes the cpu , which translates to shorter battery life  .
with the lack of quality software integration , this power    house of a phone is almost completely wasted and the poor battery life is almost makes this phone not worth it  .
in fact , i have seen the hero perform smoother than my moment  .
at the end of the day , this phone leaves me with mixed feelings , but at least it is cheap .
this is a good messaging and media phone  .
sprint tv and music playback have awesome sound , facebook interface and internet look great  .
i couldn't be happier with email management  .
i have five email accounts pulling into this device  .
all is well the phone feels heavy and a little unbalance when typing on the slideout qwerty keyboard  .
it's really noticeable when typing a long message/email  .
also , the keyboard backlight turns off in an unreasonably short time  .
if you pause for only a few seconds , the light goes away , and you have to click a key , one that you cannot see , to make it come back on  .
it is not adjustable in the phone's settings if you use your phone heavily as a phone , keep looking  .
i am satisfied with every other aspect and could live with the oddities , but because i have to dial on the go often , this is a subpar device  .
the voice dialing rarely recognizes what i'm saying  .
(i've got a plain midwest non    accent) it does not even understand yes and no most of the time  .
also for dialing , there is not customizable one touch speed dials  .
instead you can save your contacts to a favorites list , but accessing and dialing a favorite contact requires at least four key strokes and glances at the phone  .
unacceptable to this business phone user  .
i am swapping it out for an htc touch pro2 tomorrow  .
this phone could have been everything i wanted , but someone dropped the ball and overlooked basic phone functionality and made it harder for the end user  .
is it too much to ask that a phone actually works efficiently as a phone  .
i'm so disappointed  .
i love the android and its apps  .
i will miss thee .
cool looking  .
once you get used to how the phone works , it's okay    not user friendly  .
i wanted to trash it the first month , tolerated the second month , and now i look forward to a new phone in 22 months  .
i will not let my wife get one .
the moment will deliver everything you need it to from gps , to wifi , to an excellent marketplace and support for the android it does lack docking and a easy to use backup features  .
it also won't allow you to remove programs from your phone such as amazon mp3 , bejeweled , moxier mail , etc  .
that does not sound like a big deal except for the fact , these programs will automatically start and you cannot prevent that from happening  .
they kill your battery and take up precious cpu resources  .
i can barely make it through the day without the need to recharge on minimum use  .
the onscreen keyboard and slideout keyboard are its saving grace and one of the reasons i chose this over the hero  .
before i recommend this phone to someone sprint or samsung will need to release a patch to enable the removal of programs that start automatically (even after you kill the process)  .
or a way to permanently turn off selected programs .
this is a great phone other than the battery life and i cant seem to find how to delete ringtones and stuff but overall i love the samsung moment  .
i like this phone but feel it should have far fewer problems than it does phone sometimes has problems hanging up , touch interface is sometimes sluggish/laggy (iphone is flawless with it's interface speed)  .
it should also run much faster , considering it's got an 800mhz processor  .
the slide out action starts to feel not    so    solid after about a month of frequent use  .
internet youtube performance somehow decreased when i connected to the starbucks wifi  .
oftentimes while in a call , the screen would go black right as i is trying to enter numbers for the automated system (which are already frustrating enough to deal with  .
) , sometimes hitting the numbers while in a call had no effect , thus ejecting me from an automated system and causing me to pull hair out  .
samsung needs to fix all of these real    world issues with a software update  .
and hopefully android 2  .
1 will solve the rest of them i'm a pretty hardcore samsung geek , with two lcd's for my dell , a samsung laser printer (with a dell logo on it) , a samsung 52 hd lcd tv and a samsung blu ray player  .
this was not at all intentional i've just found these particular products the best value  .
and the samsung moment is probably no exception  .
it's their first android smartphone so they need to fix the issues that users experience multiple times each day  .
and fast  .
okay phone if battery life is anywhere important to you this phone is not for you  .
if i could exchange my phone for a new one i definitlely would .
check out other options  .
if i were to do it all over , i would look closer at htc phones  .
this is the second samsung i've had and i thought they would have improved over my last phone , at least on battery life  .
(old phone is an instinct)  .
next time going to wait  .
not happy with phone solely because battery does not last .
it is not worth the money , good idea but terribly executed .
this phone is extremely sluggish  .
it's drives me crazy trying to make a simple phone call  .
it force closes all the time  .
while on the phone it is continuously muting itself (and i have the updated software)  .
it's very frustrating  .
the speaker phone does not work at all  .
i have yet to have a conversation on it  .
everyone tells me that i sound muffled and that they can not hear me  .
my screen has shattered twice since i have owned the phone (3 months) from , like i said , simple , light falls  .
the glass is way to sensitive and should not be shattering so easily  .
my nieces phone has shattered once already as well  .
she has this same phone  .
i have owned many phones and have never , ever had my screen shatter the way this one does so easily  .
i seriously think something is really wrong with this phones screen as what are the chances of the screen having to be replaced three times in one family from ebing shattered  .
i am normally not hard on my phones  .
i've only had this phone for 3 months and i already want a new one desperately .
not a road warrior phone / business user phone  .
would like to keep an android phone with pull    out keyboard    but battery and usability in car are deal breakers  .
i prefer a battery that can last a few days with moderate use of sms , and checking email via mobile web  .
having to unlock the phone every time the screen goes dim is annoying  .
(android issue / not samsung)  .
will have to downgrade to a dumber phone i'm afraid  .
very sad for me since i'm an e    commerce executive trying to use current technology curve .
watch out where you buy this device or sign up for a sprint plan  .
we (me and my family) signed up at an authorized sprint dealer  .
authorized by who we ask  .
we began having these problems with the phone within one week  .
when we returned to the authorized sprint dealer they could not have cared less , sending us to exchange the phones at a sprint corporate store  .
we get the a local sprint corporate store in a mall , and they check out the phone affirm it is defective , then ask us to go to the radio shack three doors down in the mall  .
huh  .
we go to radio shack telling the store manager we were sent by their neighbor sprint  .
radio shack store manager asks for the phone number assigned to the phone looks the number up on his database , then goes to the back of the store and gets a replacement samsung moment  .
he explained that radio shack owns the kiosk in sam's club where we originally signed up  .
problems with the phone persist  .
frame freezes and the phone mysteriously goes into airplane mode which stops all incoming / outgoing calls until you take the cover off , pull the battery and reset / reboot the phone  .
sprint corporate reps tell us to wait a few more days , your 30 day period has almost gone by ; when that happens you can get full sprint customer service  .
well , 30 days came and went  .
the sprint full customer service rep tells us we need another new device  .
we tell the sprint corporate reps that we have been patient and tolerant enough already with these problematic samsung moment phones , we would like something more reliable whether it cost more or less , we do not really care (if less , keep the money , just provide us with something reliable)  .
here's the real smack in the face   sir , your 30 days has expired , now we can only replace with the same model , the samsung moment  .
ok , we are patient , cordial , and tolerant of the unreliable device for just over thirty days and now we are stuck because of our patience  .
corporate policies be darned (not the word i is looking for) , what about simple and reasonable customer care  .
lesson   ask plenty of what ifs no matter who you are buying / contracting with .
phone needs improvement , its just a copy of tmobiles g1 , same everything but for sprint and the worse part , if you are on a phone call you have to worry if your face clicks on something , this problem is never done with iphone but then again , iphone has no keyboard  .
had i known the phone is this bad , i wouldnt have sign extension with sprint to get this phone  .
i love the fact that this is a good business phone  .
i get my office emails and calendar from outlook , which is great  .
unfortunately , i need bluetooth and wi fi as well as text , etc  .
if i try to use all of these programs the phone lasts 6    8 hours  .
if the only answer is don't use them , then why do i need the phone to do everything  .
if there is a hard shut off for programs , i cannot find it in the manual  .
i also cannot find how to synch my phone with my personal computer outlook calendar through the usb  .
maybe this is a sprint problem and not a phone problem , but the gps does not seem to lock on unless i'm outside making google maps and places directory useless  .
it took me fifteen minuted to find a hair cuttery , and i finally gave up  .
if there is a better way to use the phone , then the directions should explain that to you  .
i'm just praying this gets better and i learn more before the two year contract is up  .
otherwise i'm getting a iphone .
i purchased this phone the saturday before its official release  .
i must admit that the phone is very nice  .
the screen is beautiful , the physical keyboard is great , the app store is awesome , and you can pretty much customize the phone to your liking  .
however i returned the phone because of its battery issues  .
if you want to prove whether i am being truthful about the battery issue just do a google  .
after unplugging the charger once the battery is full , the power will jump from from 100% to 80% after touching an app on the phone  .
you will have to charge this phone at least twice a day with minimal use  .
this is a known issue and it is hard to believe that people are giving this phone a 5 star  .
do not listen to these people saying just download task killer and everything will be fine  .
i downloaded task killer , turned off gps , set email settings to check once a hour , and every other thing suggested online and this just do not work  .
i think an update is needed to correct this problem  .
so i returned the moment for a htc hero on wednesday  .
i really wish i could have kept this phone but it is useless because unless i is able to stay by an electrical outlet it is a waste  .
i hope i have helped someone to make up their mind concerning this purchase .
the android and all its apps , have more relevance than the billion apps found on the iphone  .
if your looking for true efficient ergonomics the samsung moment will freeze time and enable you to escape onto the highest peaks of the world of mobile telecommunication  .
sliding the screen back and accessing the keyboard filled me with the same satisfaction i recieved when i first loaded de_dust 2 in counterstrike or the pure bliss of turning over the fourth card in a magic the gathering booster pack and finding a mox lotus  .
in summation buy google phones  .
i have to take the battery at least once per day  .
i'm on my 2nd samsung moment  .
the first one i returned to sprint because i is certain the phone must be defective  .
the 2nd one is just as bad  .
often the phone rings and i cannot answer because the buttons are frozen .
this phone just doesn't give me the feeling of security and reliability  .
it just does not work the way it claims  .
should have stuck with my blackberry .
switched to this from the motorola cliq and is met with a myriad of disappointment  .
it would seem that this phone is rushed to compete with already available competition by offering features not previously available , however in the first week i became vividly aware of all of the bugs and qwerks that differentiated this with other android offerings  .
first off the well known issues are of amongst the worst , enabling wifi will in most cases either immediately lock up data on the phone or at random , this is a known issue that samsung refuses to acknowledge or remedy  .
i is pleasantly surprised to realize the potential of evdo on the device but it seemingly struggles holding onto an evdo connection and often reverts to 1rx without warning or provocation  .
the phones hardware seems more than capable to handle tasks previously unavailable to mid range handsets but menial tasks such as pandora radio instantly crash or function poorly  .
the overall firmware issues involved with the phone have drove me to the brink of reviewing the source code and re    writing large portions of it  .
needless to say out of box performance is abysmal and has easily deterred me from considering samsung in future for android based devices .
online forums consistently reenforce that the phone has some serious bugs which have not been fixed  1  .
airplane mode  .
will turn on at will and shut down incoming calls , 3g , and outgoing calls  .
you have to manually reset it (which means you could have been unable to receive phone calls for hours really bad if you use this phone for any kind of business application)  .
3g does not work well , or sometimes at all  .
reception on the phone can be unreliable , and not even as good as the $20 phone you picked up for your little nephew to chew on  .
the moment has issues getting on , or staying on wifi  .
my little itouch does this seamlessly , but with the moment i am always checking to see if it is connected , then trying to convince it that there is a wireless signal , and to get on it  .
kind of a hassle i would classify this as a smart phone failure  .
it would be better to use an itouch (for cool apps) and an old beater phone that works , then have a new android phone that only works half of the time if you do not need a reliable phone , and want an android (google os) , then this phone is for you  .
if you need something that is reliable and consistent , then by all means , do not get this phone  .
this phone is a disappointment  .
i am sorry i bought it  .
i thought it would live up the hype it didn't  .
do not get me wrong , there are some wonderful features on this  .
the games apps are nice and you can actually see what you need to make this work  .
youtube streams wonderfully and has given me quite a few moments of fun and laughter while waiting for appointments and at the dmv the phone is a relentless butt dialer , even in the case made for it , some how the screen rubs and comes to life and it's off and dialing  .
not unusual for this phone to send random texts and e    mails  .
the camera is mediocre at best and the video camera is more useless than the camera on my lg rumor  .
all in all i am very disappointed and am looking for a new and different phone .
i think this could have been a good phone if they spent more time trying to make it a good smartphone  .
again , why mute on the main screen  .
why , why why  .
their are so many why did they do this it is not a very good phone , i am very dissapointed and wish i would have gotten something better with some of the same features , but now i am stuck  .
on top of it my provieder sprint is not very good themself , so i have two big problems  .
i use my phone around 6000 min  .
a month for business , so i depend on my phone , so i am veyr upset and dissapointed about my ability to constantly drop calls , people cant here me , people say i sound bad , the complaints go on and on and on  .
i just wanted a really good phone , but i got junk that dose not work well  .
, that is unless you want music , camera , apps , email , but for a phone , no  .
bu something else if you want a phone not a good phone at all , a waste of money and will drive you crazy .
would not recommend this phone to anyone  .
theres so many other choices  .
calls don't always come through and it doesn't say missed call on the phone  .
it rings when it wants to even though its on loud  .
lastly if you get on the internet a lot or text message a lot the battery is not for you  .
yea they sent out a software update twice that is supposed to help these problems but it did not  .
if you do buy the phone i would say make sure your in a good area to use it even someone from sprint support stated that when i called about the issues .
specs   sph    m900 , upgraded android from 1  .
5 to 2  .
1 , eclair  .
de03 , linux kernel 2  .
29 rooted  .
if sprint is looking for a motorola droid competetor this is certainly not the answer battery life   i purchased this phone with android 1  .
the battery life is fine for the first few days  .
about a week later it would go from a full charge to 80% in about 30 seconds  .
maybe that's why they call it the moment , cause it only really stays on for a moment or two  .
it did not matter if you were running 1 program or 50 , with wifi and gps on or off , or even in airplane mode  .
i researched the issue , and the battery life on this phone is terrible for 3 reasons , first there are communication issues between the battery and the phone  .
your battery can be fully charged but your phone reports it about 20% lower than it really is  .
second , 800mhz is a hungry processor  .
lastly , the cpu has problems idling  .
sometimes it idles sometimes it runs at a full 800mhz , even in standby  .
and when it's not idling it gets hot to the touch  .
heat destroys lithium ions (moment's battery)  .
so , it's a vicious circle  .
upgrading with the cl14 update and later to android 2  .
1 did not fix this issue  .
some experts say that washing the battery (full discharge and recharge 3 times) will solve this problem  .
this would be fine if it were a nicad or a nickle cadmium battery , but lithium ion batteries should never be washed  .
it litterally cuts their lifespan in half how i fixed the battery life   i rooted the kernel , deleted all of sprint' bloatware , and downloaded 2 programs from the android market   setcpu    which allows you to control your cpu to the t , and spare parts , which allows you to change certain settings in power usage  .
with these fixes and a fresh new battery , i went from average 6 hours of battery life with heavy use , to about 24 hours with heavy use look and feel   at first glance the phone is nice  .
it's a little bulky but it doesn't take up too much pocket space  .
the screen along with the resolution are a huge plus  .
it is able to run mobile youtubehd which is great  .
the keyboard is great  .
not as good as the htc touch pro was , but it's a close 2nd and it puts the droid's keyboard to shame in terms of ease of use and overall feel performance   the phone does perform though , when it's not crashing and force closing apps  .
one problem i've found and heard from many other users is the phone just shuts off  .
for no reason at all , it will just go into a hard shut    down  .
receiving a call  .
sending a text  .
too bad  .
the moment doesn't care  .
the android os provides for much of the moment's functionality so i'm reviewing the phone not the os  .
however , when i found out that the moment did not have native live wallpaper support in the 2  .
1 update , i is very disappointed  .
it does however support live    wallpapers with a manual configuration features   whoever thought of the standard headphone jack on this phone should be promoted  .
genius idea  .
who wants to pay $30 or more for a micro    usb to audio converter  .
i do not  .
honestly , this is the best feature on the phone usb connectivity is an absolute nightmare for anyone who's not computer    savvy  .
even i had some problems  .
i should not have to download 100megs of drivers for this to show up on my pc  .
some skeptics will say this is windows' fault but it's really samsung's when it comes down to it  .
it took about 4 hours and 2 computers to finally get it recognized on a computer conclusion   i do not understand why cnet gave this phone such a rave review  .
my guess is the person who reviewed it had the phone for about a day  .
if i had this phone for a day and had to reviewed it , it would receive 4 stars too  .
the moment is just a mediocre phone  .
it's a great device if you only use it as a phone  .
it looks great on paper , but when you actually sit down and use it for a while , you'll quickly realize its shortcomings  .
honestly , look at the market values  .
why do you think the moment is down to $69  .
99 and the droid is still $199  .
the problems of the moment had a negative effect on its popularity which , in turn , increaded its refund and return rate which decreased its market value frankly , the moment is a poor to mediocre android phone    woodhammer  .
updated  .
on may 19 , 2010  .
would not recommend  .
the phone has a super cheap feel to it and the os isnt streamlined in any fashion  .
do not buy .
i wanted to keep this phone liked it for it's apparent features but with the technical issues i went thru , i just had to change to another brand at my phone service provider  .
i switched to the htc hero totally pleased now updated  .
on mar 15 , 2010  .
