Pros:. Slim, compatible with almost all OS, does a good job, cool speed. 
Cons:. No cons at all. 
Summary:. Needed a slim and smooth working network drive. It satisfies these requirements and is operable on all OS (I have used it on Win, Linux and Mac).. 

$$;
Pros:. Lot of storage space, doesn?t get warm soon, 1 store for all my work files. 
Cons:. No flips yet. 
Summary:. For my new Xbox I wanted a spacious storage for all my music and videos. Sound mixing and editing work files are also there which required them all to be in one place for quick reference. I picked up 34337 only to serve this purpose. Moreover it doesn?t get warm soon, which is a rare plus seen in most of the ext hard drives I have used yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is the best home media I have ever bought. 
Cons:. I hope there may never be any. 
Summary:. I was looking for a supercompatible, easy-to-go, large-memory media networkdrive and I thought I'll have to wait for a long time to find one that fits my bill. Now I know it is a good decision and I could see that however often I may use it...it has been mor than a year since purchased and till date it has been stupendous.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup, simple and easy-to-follow guide, wireless printer facility, itunes server, remote access. 
Cons:. Noise from network drives. 
Summary:. Setting up my Iomega Home Media on my Windows XP happened instantaneously. I did not have any confusion; just followed the instruction on the documentation and the set up was done. Extremely happy that I can share files on different operating systems in my home network. Connected my home media to my wireless router and it is nice that my printer has also gone wireless. Was wondering about the speeds on a wireless setup but I am happy with the performance and there is very little difference between a wired and wireless setup. Since this hard drive works as iTunes server we play our favorite videos on it directly. I also noted that this device does not need any software and I am not using any of the software that came with it. It allows me remote access of my files secure. It is best to opt for firmware updates as soon as you have your device installed as it improves the functionality which may not be available otherwise. The exhaust fan in the device is the main culprit for making that noise but this is very essential as it lets the NAS cool down.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up and use. Printer access is really working and doesn?t slowdown even on expanded network. Cool server. 
Cons:. No complaints, exceeded my expectations. 
Summary:. This network attached storage device is one which makes for easy setup, functioning and secure network protection. Have 3 comps, all are Windows 7, software pretty much takes care of everything else. Printing generally gets a bit slow, despite the access on a network, but am surprised this server doesn?t show up a slowdown of printer access on network. Certainly a cool server.. 

$$;
Pros:. * Pretty easy to setup. * Excellent amount of storage. * Easy to connect to with PCs and game consoles. 
Cons:. * At least on my network, uploading files can be sluggish. * Is a little noisy. 
Summary:. This drive solved my media storage needs for home-based business and entertainment media all in one go. I haven't used the print server, but that's a nice plus on the unit. It's easy to set up and once it's running and you have your files loaded you can access it from any PC (even my little netbook, which is a nice way to watch archived TV shows in widescreen). I haven't tried connecting to it with the Xbox 360 but my PS3 detected it automatically and gives me access to all my TV shows in high def through its HDMI connection so I don't have to watch everything on my PC monitor.. I love this drive and have recommended it to my friends.. 

$$;
Pros:. gigaethernet, printer server, 1 TB not expensive below 200 dlls, compatible with mac pc and linux wow.. runs cool, small, conveniant i am verry imprised. 
Cons:. none exept have to install software for some reson software could be a little better (minor issues). 
Summary:. i bougth this on a sunday that same day in less then 10 min i was running everything lots of space, runs cool, have to say.. i recomend this to anyone who wants to put in a small inexpensive Extenal networkable Drive.. this is it... MAC and PC... i have run maxtor products and western digital .. this is better... 

$$;
Pros:. easy to set up, easy to use; good speed; media server works great to my PS3. 
Cons:. drive not end-user serviceable. 
Summary:. I've read a lot of the other complaints about this drive, and i guess i've been lucky; it's worked as advertised out of the box since i got it a little less than a year ago. recently upgraded the firmware, then plugged an NTFS-formatted 750GB USB drive into it's USB port and it works great. i have both PCs (XP. Vista, Win7) and a MacBook Pro (OS X 10.6), and all can see the drive. had some spotty problems with the Home Storage Manager on the Mac, but I just use the Mac Finder - no problems there. don't use the included backup software. haven't tried the new Time Machine support yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. ++ Very simple to setup.. + syncing process for the user directories. ++ DLNA worked immediately with a single click. + relatively silent - you hear clicks when the disk is working. 
Cons:. - The backup software is easy to use, but it is slow compared with for instance Timemachine on a MAC. 
Summary:. When visiting my sister over christmas, I found they had no backup for 4 years of photos.. So we went buying this NAS-device - mainly for price reasons.. It took only 30 minutes to get everything working:. 1 PC on XP , 1 Laptop on Vista, WLAN via FritzBox and a Philips LCD TV. After installing the software and connecting the Iomega tothe WLAN-Router (FritzBox), you could see immediately the pre-configured directories and the software suggested to syncronize the Homedirectory with the NAS box.. We changed that slightly to syncronize only the pictures with the picture folder. With a little clicking arround we found the DLNA seting in the Web-administration interface and activated it.. It the directly interworked with the Philips TV (also via WLAN) - Cool - but do not expect a snappy performanc when browsing the pictures, the pictures are transferred in 10Megapixel to the TV via WLAN andthen need to be scaled down by th TV. that takes about 3-5 seconds and is ok in slide-show-mode.. Now the setup is, that pictures and music is synced to the picture and music folder.. and the PCs are incrementally backed up once a week to the backup folder.. Conclusion: Just what was needed as a second palce to store pictures and music.. 

$$;
Pros:. Time machine works well with Snow Leopard. Drives do mount on desktop after all. Works well for streaming HD content to e.g. an A.C Ryan Playon media player. 
Cons:. noisy. hard to set up. clumsy interface (Home Storage manager). poor install guide and poor help functionality - if you can find this at all. changes between the firmware versions don't give you confidence in the product. 
Summary:. Out of the box this drive worked well with OS X 10.4. After updating firmware problems began.. Took me a solid night to:. - update firmware and Home Storage manager (different versions for both OS X 10.4 and 10.6 machines). - find out that the newly created folders on my Macintosh HD (server movies, server pictures, etc) were non-functional and local anyway. - find out that in 10.6 instead I had to actively check a box in the sidebar preferences (alt click on left side of finder window) to mount servers on my desktop to make the network drive folders appear. - find out that a space in the name of the drive caused this to be invisible for both Macs. - After all of this - one night further - everything worked well and even time machine was running!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good build quality, Nice cosmetics, 1TB drive less than 150 USD, Supports Gigabit ethernet, cooling mechanism inbuilt, simple user interface, EMC Retrospect HD Routine backup suite included. Mozy Home cluster backup software also included.. 
Cons:. !!! LACKS ADVANCED NAS FEATURES!!! (cannot access files over the web), No idle spin down feature, Cooling fan generates a bit of noise (audible in silent environment), Single Volume Drive (forget RAID Capabilities).. 
Summary:. Got this product from FRY's store thru my brother. Excellent packaging. User manual and other basic setup information available in the package. The power adapter is compatible for 100~240v range. CAT 5e LAN Cable included that connects from NAS port to the LAN port. Formatting this 1TB drive is very simple. Just follow the links in the system menu of the user interface that the device incorporates. Be warned the entire drive may be formatted in a single click. So only format the drive for the first time. No partitioning support(atleast i did not find anything from the user interface to partition the drive).. Data is stored in folders. Some default folders available like music, photos, backups, etc.. , but you can also create folders of your choice. Also in the interface you create/add users and store the username and password information in the NAS. User based access can be given to folders, there is no folder write protection. Once you gain entry to the NAS you can read/write/overwrite the contents of the accessible folders.. Will not be using the bundled Retrospect HD, so no comments on the automatic/scheduled backup capabilites.. *** For good data transfer rates over your network bundle this buy with an 10/100/1000 Mbps switch (Gigabit Switch) or Home routers that support full duplex 10/100/1000 Mbps ports. ***. In conclusion HOME MEDIA NETWORK DRIVE : good buy, if drive capacity is considered, but definately needs improvement on features and settings that will improve the drives functioning.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive, $135.00 on sale at Frys, Easy to use, Streams to XBOX360. 
Cons:. Does not stream WMA lossless files, Will not work with NTFS USB hard drives. 
Summary:. I like this unit. It allows me to stream music, video and pictures to my XBOX360 without turning on a PC.. I am disappointed in the fact that the packaging and specs say it supports NTFS USB hard drives but it does not. I am also disappointed in the fact that iOmega says it supports WMA but it only supports compressed WMA not lossless. Still, I will keep mine until I can justify something more expensive.. 

$$;
Pros:. The installation instructions were straightforward and clear, and it was affordable. For an ordinary network I am sure it would be a great NAS.. 
Cons:. The drive has no MAC Address! I was trying to connect it to a secure network (no dynamic IPs), so I needed the MAC address to assign it an IP address. After much work I found it could not connect to the network unless I configured for DHCP.. 
Summary:. For an ordinary DHCP home network, it is a great NAS, but for businesses schools and such you need to go for a more expensive drive with a MAC Address. It baffles me that they would not give the drive designed to connect to a network an address, even my Nintendo has one.. 

$$;
Pros:. slick design, small footprint, NAS. 
Cons:. Lack of OS X compatibility, No plug'n'play, no out of the box Timemachine support.. 
Summary:. Connecting this drive to a iMac(intel) has been a long yet fruitful experience, fruitful because it seems now to be working with Timemachine.. for the moment at least. Out the box the iMac did not recognize the drive. I tried everything to achieve this, connected via ethernet to the router, ethernet to iMac directly, usb connection to iMac but nothing worked. The software that comes in the box did not even recognize the drive. Only way to connect was using command prompt, something I'm not an expert in but it still did not appear mounted. Besides this is supposedly plug&#38;play, not so for Mac OS X. I contacted the Iomega support, although very helpful they could not help me. Then I found this blog;http://roncox.org/12, followed the instructions and voila! Now not only does Timemachine work but the Iomega 'Home Storage Manager' also finds the drive. Pure joy but it took way too long and it really should not be neccessary to use command prompts to get a drive working. Iomega should review their statement about OS X compatibility.. We'll see if it behaves and keeps working.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup once you contact support to get the curent software to support Win7. Built-in printer switch. Cheap Price. Management software easy to use.. 
Cons:. Software response is very slow.. Drive inside is amazingly slow. Copy from one folder to another takes hours (literally). 8+ hours for 600Gb.. Gigabit network is a joke. only achieves 10Mb/s on optimized Gigabit network and 6ft CAT6 cable.. 
Summary:. I liked it due to price and stated performance. Unfortunately, I just have an expensive printer switch now because my 5-year-old 80Gb USB external drive transfers backups faster. I realize I am hardly a "normal user", but I really would like to use it as a backup device...not just a printer switch. I guess you get what you pay for. This "NAS" seems to work well, the printer switch works GREAT, the software looks hokey but functional, I got chat support for the software since the software in the box didn't support Win7 (chat was very nice once I came to the top of the queue). I wouldn't recommend this unit to any of my friends, though. With the best transfer rate achieved being 13Mb/sec over Gigabit connecting to my system with Teamed Gb NICS and RAID-1 drives inside and a 6ft CAT6 cable is...well...just plain pathetic. Transferring to another computer on my network (without the RAID and with a 50ft Cat5e cable), I get around 65Mb/sec sustained so I know it isn't my network or my computer causing the bottleneck.. 

$$;
Pros:. Value--with Vista or prior. 
Cons:. No Windows7, typical Iomega proprietary, non-standard interface. 
Summary:. Shame on me (been fooled twice). Iomega cobbles together potentially excellent hardware, then ruins it with an alien interface. Example: Iomega REV drive is the only reasonably priced removable media hard drive for backup. Yet, it shows up as a CDROM! So much standard software won't work with it.. They've done it again. This thing could be so useful if it were just a network hard drive...especially if you could connect an NTFS external drive to the USB port. Instead they put a typical goofy Iomega interface that limits its application to supported operating systems. It never occured to me that a Vista-compatible device would not work with W7. What's with you people at Iomega? Mine's going back to Dell on Monday. Thanks for nothing, Iomega. This is the last time I even consider a product with your name on the box!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy ans fast installation. Cool iTunes server. NAS works flawlessly.. Price is sweet.. 
Cons:. EMC Retrospec HD 2.5 software crashes continuously and make the whole computer crash .... 
Summary:. I chose this model because it came with a backup software and this is the first use of this NAS, to backup my home computers (4 laptops and 2 desktops) daily and automatically. But this feature does not work. There's a bug in the EMC Retrospec HD2.5 software that is known by EMC since but no fix available.. EMC Retrospec Express HD is just a teaser.. So buy something else if like me you need a NAS to perform automatic home network backup.. 

$$;
Pros:. light, compact, easy to set up. 
Cons:. advertised to provide NFS - does not. No CLI or web interface - the configuration is done with a remote control displayed to a TV. 
Summary:. It is more for entertainment than for any NAS function. No NFS.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looked like just the thing for a small home office.. 
Cons:. Hours on the phone with tech support. Very poor web site for finding windows 7 supported software. Finally tech support concluded the drive has problems .... For another $40 bucks we can send you a replacement.... 
Summary:. This is the second NAS drive I have purchased from Iomega and both are gathering dust. Fool me twice shame on me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good storage, easy to use and setup. 
Cons:. After updated the firmweare, drive is locked. any small issues, such as stop backup it will cost the system lock. Tech support not helpful.. 
Summary:. The system is not smart. When it stop in the middle of the backup or any process, it locks up the drive. You can't go back to the earlier version of the firmware. Be ready to loss your data.. 

$$;
Pros:. Low cost NAS drive w/ an easy to use feature set.. 
Cons:. Work perfectly for about two weeks then failed to show up on my network. When I finally got it to mount, the 400gb of data I had on it had disappeared. Customer service is poor and a replacement drive arrived in a crushed box w/ no padding.. 
Summary:. Great price with nice features, but horrid customer service and an unreliable product. Not worth it, go for a Lacie NAS.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy install. 
Cons:. Not very robust; backup would stop each night because it could not copy one file without trying to copy the rest of the files. After deleting some files, my computer will not recognize the Iomega drive. The forums are not help so far.. 
Summary:. No good. Buy something else.. Updated. on Jul 31, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Would be nice if it worked as advertised. 
Cons:. Doesn't work as advertised. 
Summary:. Lot and lots of problems getting this NAS to connect in my house. I haven't even tapped into the extensive feature list, but when I went up to Iomega's support site I saw all the other frustrated users. Don't try to call phone support, they don't offer it. Really too bad. I bought this over a month ago and have been trying to get it to work, now my return policy is up.. 

$$;
Pros:. They look pretty. 
Cons:. out of four products including this one there is only one left working and I'm assuming I need to back it up to something reliable. Their products never seem to keep working.. 
Summary:. Backup software does not seem to work, The products break down and support from the company is non-existant. This item broke down within two months of purchase. All my backups are lost. My experience has been horible!. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to install. 
Cons:. restrospect backup software doesn't work; poor/frustrating customer support;all of a sudden the folders you create are inaccessible. 
Summary:. Don't waste your money.. The advertised features don't work and the customer support is poor. For no apparent reason I cant access any of the shared folders on the drive even though the computer can see them. (visit the user forum and see how many people have this problem!). Imagine tech support suggested that I "try formatting the drive" -to lose all my data!....obviously clueless.. the Print server feature never worked....neither did the backup software that came with it now I have apparently lost my data. Do your own research into problems with this product before you even consider using it.. Youve been warned. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks pretty.. 
Cons:. Will not connect to network. Registration website does not recognize the serial number. I bought this at Fry's so it can't be a knockoff, and I've followed the entire ONE page of directions to the letter.. 
Summary:. I have no experience with this device, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK!!!.
