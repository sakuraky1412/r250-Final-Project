works , looks excellent , i like the sony ps3 because it is a tech wonder , it offers highly regarded blu    ray and games as well  .
the games are beatiful on it  .
upgrades are plenty , this is always cool , because you get the most recent technology .
this is the absolute best system out there , i say this with no doubt in my mind  .
this is my first playstation and so i guess everyone else's complaint about it not being backwards compatible with ps2 is really a non    issue for me  .
i bought this console because i wanted a blu    ray player  .
since i like video games (i is mostly a nintendo player) and is in the market for a bd player , i just decided to get a ps3  .
all i can say is that i'm really happy with it and i use my ps3 for gaming now more than i do for watching movies  .
anyway , i love my ps3 now  .
i also had xbox 360 and i can say that the ps3 is a more elegant device .
it is not a perfect 10 (more like 9  .
5) bt too many people have offered poor criticisms in their reviews so here is the real deal sony has hit the nail on head with the playstation 3  .
unlike microsoft's xbox 360 you do not have to pay for costly upgrades (hard drive , wifi , headsets , online subscription gaming , etc  .
) right off the bat you can upgrade to non    sony components saving you time and money  .
one of the neatest features is pairing the bluetooth headset that you thought could only work with your cell phone  .
but then add the built    in wifi connectivity and free online gaming and you've already surpassed the xbox 360 on top of its superior gaming abilities , this black box is also a home media player that will play most movie formats including divx and wmv  .
if 40gb is not enough then buy any notebook hard drive (2  .
5 sata) to expand its capacity up to 320gb (wd scorpio) one feature that ties into the home media system is the ability to browse and download files directly from the internet through the browser  .
that's right , you can watch and view youtube and flash files online or visit the piratebay and download your divx movies one of the few pitfalls is sony trying to figure out what people can afford or want to pay for (20gb , 60gb 80gb systems) but i think its been dialed in as now people are realizing for $399 you get all this and a blu    ray player another pitfall is the lack of great games  .
while xbox gets halo (over    rated) and gears of war exclusively (at least for now) ps3 owners have been waiting for metal gear and other titles to finally hit the store room floors with the $399 price (rumored to drop to $299) you get the best of all worlds with this system over the xbox 360 and undoubtedly 2008 will be the year that the sony playstation 3 will overtake all game consoles    just to wait  .
i had an x360 , and it broke  .
so i bought a ps3 , and wow  .
i'm amazed  .
free online gaming for the same quality you get on xbl , and even better , with mods and custon made maps (for ut3) , it's as open as a pc for this  .
you can plug a mouse keyboard , browse the web , install linux , etc  .
you can do anything  .
it even read divx files , and even read them from your pc's virtual servers (like wmp11)  .
the games are great and some games load faster on ps3 then on x360 (like devil may cry 4 , wich install itself on the ps3 to load faster)  .
some bigtime exclusives like mgs4 and the final fantasies  .
etc  .
i'm happy with it  .
i am sorry , but cnet you guys got it wrong the rating cnet has is good but not good enough  .
for the other people who have already rated this are totally wrong  .
also this website is just not up to date so i am here to help with that for the people who would like to know the truth about the ps3  .
this system is backwards compatible , the menu is so easy to use and understand on first use  .
the playstation store allows you to download game demos and movie trailers and background themes for cool new ways to show off some style  .
the playstation store also allows you the opportunity to download classic ps1 games as well as psp games  .
beat that xbox 360  .
i just cant stop there are so many more things to say about the ps3 it is incredible , some people just dont understand  .
also when playing a ps2 game on the ps3 it automatically creates a replica of a memory card for the ps2 on the hard drive , i am still upset that other people have not realized this and still think the ps3 is a joke  .
oh and dont worry the games will come , for example gta4 , metal gear solid 4 , devil may cry 4 , shall i go on  .
ok how about final fantasy 13 .
if you dont care about ps2 capability like i dont , then this is the system for you  .
i am not a big gamer , i usually just play sport games so i do not need a huge hdd then buy this  .
i would also recommend you purchase the hdmi cable if you tv is capable for it since it makes the picture so much more clearer  .
outstanding system and definitely recommend this to anyone who is just a basic gamer  .
i would recommend this machine to everyone interested in playing games and movies in blue ray hd .
here a way to get one free  .
http  //www  .
yourps34free  .

php  .
ref  4544229 ok ths is no joke it relly works  .
so all you need to do is sign up and you just need referrals or points but the  .
only catch is i have a printer so i got  .
ink cartriges because you do have to complete one buy but even so $35 and 10  .
referrals later you get one ps3 (80gig) , two controls , one free game , free shipping to me  .
thats free as anyone will get  .
hope i can help  .
cnet can   about fine points if they want but if i had $400 and could choose any game console this would be the one  .
it packs the most value in for the price out of all the next gen consoles including the wii and every flavor of the xbox 360 and playstation 3 the whole machine cost less than just adding upgrades to the lowest price xbox 360  .
to upgrade the xbox 360 arcade to be like the 40 gb playstation 3 you would need a hard drive $99    $189 , wi    fi add on $99 , hd    dvd drive $180 , and online service $50 per year  .
their is no contest    this is a better value also cnet says that the bad is    .
compelling exclusive games are still few and far between ;    i have personally downloaded nearly 50 of the weekly free game demos that come from the playstation network  .
also ratchet clank , uncharted   drakes fortune , heavenly sword , warhawk , motorstorm and a ton of other games are available for the playstation 3  .
all the same games that are available for the xbox 360 are available for the playstation 3 (except of course for exclusives such as gears of war , bioshock , and mass effect) doesn't play ps2 games ;    well for $100 more you can get the 80 gb version that has can play ps2 games and includes motorstorm  .
also for $129 you can buy a ps2 slim or you can buy a used one for much less ($50    $75) at a gamestop or eb games playstation home and rumble controller not available until 2008 ;    cnet really is just nit    picking and being hypocritical with this one  .
they do not mention that the xbox 360 does not have motion sensing or a virtual player avatar yet as a con for the system a usb port on the back would've been nice ;  .
well bluetooth on the xbox 360 or a usb port on my behind would have been nice too but it aint there  .
no infrared port means non    bluetooth universal remotes are not compatible ;    are you kidding  .
how can you complain that you would rather have an infared remote supported rather than a bluetooth one  .
i found the bluetooth remote to be lighter and to have more range  .
it is like complaining that your dvd player does not support vhs tapes  .
really petty cnet  .
glossy black finish is a fingerprint magnet ;    well white finishes are a dirt and stain magnet  .
i guess they would rather look at dirt , scuffs , and stains than notice a fingerprint up close  .
still petty cnet  .
online gaming , media , and commerce options not nearly as developed as xbox live  .
considering the service just came out last year it is still on par with xbox live  .
in fact i am disappointed that microsoft is not doing more with the service considering the enormous head multi    year start xbox live had and that they charge each gold member $50 per year  .
with all that time and money they have the consumer should have received more or it should be free by now despite cnet's petty nit    picking i say that the 40 gb playstation 3 is by far and away the best value for the money that you are going to see in next generation gaming  .
all that and it comes with a free copy of the high definition version of the spider    man 3 movie    worth $35 on it own .
it really doesnt matter if it can or cannot play ps2 games that is not what the next gen is about if you have a ps2 just play your old games on there  .
people have to just stop complaing  .
just be glade that is costs 400 not 500  .
consider this , all the games on xbox 360 are already pushing the limits of the hardware  .
ps3 games , while there are not as much as 360 are better (for the most part) and are not even close to pushing the limits of the hardware  .
all the negative reviews on this site all refer to the lesser extent of exclusive titles  .
so what  .
who cares  .
how many games do you need anyway  .
i would rather have 10 really awsome games than 15 to 20 mediocre games .
what a deal , who cares about backwards compatibility with old ps2 games that look bad in hd anyway  .
the fact that this version is quieter and cooler is icing on the cake  .
no ring of deaths either as it's not a ms product .
i have the 60gb model  .
i do not own ps or ps2 games , so the backwards compatibility is not an issue  .
this unit is loaded for $400  .
blu    ray , wifi , bluetooth , and web surfing  .
the ps3s are a dominate force in the folding@home community  .
the new 65nm cell processor in this unit allows it to run cooler and quieter than previous ps3s great item for the price  .
with the upcoming lineup of all star games approaching , casual gamers are all going to get excited for the ps3 real quick .
ps3 is the best system i used  .
ever my roomate has a 360 , and i dont like it  .
dont ask why , i dont know maybe because it doesnt have wi    fi  .
maybe cause the hard drive is small so what its removable , but the new ones cost more than the whole xbox  .
or maybe it doesnt have hdmi , for us that can save money for a good tv .
my 2 best friends have an xbox 360 and a nintendo wii , and i decided on the ps3 for myself because i like more variety in my gaming experience and because of the built    in blu    ray player  .
movies really do look better in blu    ray , and the ps3 even upconverts my current dvds to look practically hd , which means i don't need to re    purchase movies that i already have  .
for me , this is a perfect system and just what i is waiting for  .
it is worth it just for the blu    ray player alone , or for the game system alone , but to have both in one package for under $400 is a sweet deal  .
even my wife has been having fun playing it , and she's not a gamer at all  .
plus 6 free blu    ray movies thrown in how could i refuse  .
i'm really loving it so far and cannot believe i worried so much about whether and when to buy one there are so many great ps3 games out and coming soon that the library / availability is not an issue at all for me i sat out the last console generation , and have 0 ps2 games  .
so for me , backwards compatibility was not an issue , and frankly i'd rather not pay for stuff i won't use anyway 2 usb ports is all i need , since the controllers can be powered in any usb port (computer , etc)  .
the 40gb hard drive is fine for me now since i don't use too many of the media features accept demo downloads  .
i can see needing to upgrade to a larger hd in the future , but then they'll be cheaper anyway all of the supposed cons of this cheaper system did not apply to me , so it is a great buy .
the ps3 is great this is my second ps3 i also have the 360 but i am on my 4th one thanks to the red ring of death , as far as both players goes they both are great and have great future proof hdmi 1  .
3 except the 360 but if you get a new it should have but only comes with version 1  .
i love the blue ray player inside the ps3 and i have to say it looks great on my 60 inch sxrd xbr2 i love having hd and all its glory  .
there are great games out for the ps3 to so dont let people tell you there is nothing to play there are are about 10 must have games on bd and on the down loadable side from the ps network so do some research and beleave me this will hold you till the end of the year .
it's the most powerful console gaming system you can buy  .
i'm not sure what the reviewer is saying because there are already platform exclusive selling games for the ps3 such as motorstorm , ratchet clank , and uncharted   drake's fortune these are just the tip of the proverbial ps3 iceberg of exclusive games available and coming shortly in 2008 that plus a high    end blu    ray player makes this system perfect the price is finally right perfect .
the ps3 is a solid , well built console that is well worth the money  .
i would recommend this sony product to anyone  .
why go out and spend a stack of money on a blu    ray player , when you get the same features and more with the wi    fi for automatic updates and free downloads as well  .
you win all the way around with this powerful multi    functional console .
fantastic interface for gaming  .
great upscaling of video  .
need to add more things to the online browsing capability like being able to watch apple trailers or play hd videos online (abc hd content for free       does not work  .
this is the perfect system for me  .
it has bluray , state of the art gaming system , internet browser , playstation network  .
(hd games , and hd movies for sale or rent , free demos , great on    line play , etc  .
) all the storage space you need for music or pics , that the average person would use or need  .
this system is by far hard to beat  .
oh , and the price  .
, stop crying  .
and look at everything that you can do and get .
i originally purchased this as a my first blu    ray player  .
since i decided to buy a stand alone unit so i went with a samsung bdp    1400  .
needless to say i should have read the reviews for this player as its not compatible with many 2008 releases  .
after contacting samsung and getting the usual run around i decided to go back and dust off the ps3  .
i really cant find a better players available , and sure as technology gets better so will the players but as of today no one puts out a better product for the money or features  .
i also mentioned that its easily upgradable , well if you have a high speed connection either wifi or hard wired it will tell you when updates are available unlike the other brands , so you wont get stuck trying to watch batman begins on blu    ray with no updates  .
bottom line is i will not buy another blu    ray player for a while untill one comes out that does at least what this does , and with $500 price tags of some players the $399 for a player/videogame/internet browser deal cant be beat , at least not for a while .
okay overall this i enjoy my ps3 much more than my xbox 360  .
the 360 offers great online play but the ps3 is just a better overall package  .
my main problem with the 360 has always been noise , and the ps3 completely eliminates that problem  .
it's a great media center and blu    ray dvds look amazing on my hd tv now this is why i'm telling you to buy the 40gb model  .
unless you need ps2 backwards compatibility and a media card slot in the front , this model is for you  .
why  .
for the $100 premium you pay for the $60gb model you can buy a 250 gb harddrive on newegg  .
com and install it yourself  .
sony offers a step by step instruction kit and this does not void your warranty  .
very easy to install , just pull out a tray and switch two wires from your old harddrive to your new one and pop the tray back in  .
great system  .
good buy .
i will start by saying i own both the 360 and ps3  .
that said , about 90% of all my electronics are sony brand  .
nevertheless , i am no fanboy  .
the 360 is still a great , yet obnoxiously loud piece of hardware  .
however , the ps3 wins my vote with blu ray built in , wireless , quiet operation and in my opinion a much sweeter look  .
moreover , the ps3 does not go without fault  .
i hate , i mean i hate that there is no ir control for universal remote controls  .
and what's more , the dvd remote you can buy is not even backlit  .
also , the built in browser is cheesy and unless you have a 65 inch tv good luck reading a webpage from your couch , chair or even bed  .
gameplay is dead on par with that of ps2 , which is simply awesome  .
added features like usb flash drives , wireless streaming capabilities from your computer and much more  .
therefore , the ps3 wins my vote over the 360  .
ms has the online gaming locked up with xbox live , but to watch a blu ray movie , upscale an old dvd to perfection and play great games all while not even knowing the ps3 is on (hint  noisy 360) priceless  .
it has become my little computer at my tv that plays great blu    ray movies and the games are finally out  .
looks very modern and yest the audio and video is spectacular .
i wanted to get into blu    ray but wanted something future proof that i could enjoy for a very long time  .
the ps3 is a no brainer for a br player  .
not only because of its price but also because it receives profile updates often , keeping the player updated to the new specs of br  .
it's a great upconverter and obviously , the plus is that i can also get games if i wish  .
my primary use for it is movies since i bought it last jan  .
and have yet to buy a single game  .
i have a dozen br movies though  .
it's really a great product and people should not be caught in the paradigm that a console is not as good as a stand    alone player on the contrary .
the ps3 has turned out to be a much better buy than i had anticipated  .
i was not impressed with the xbox 360 , and now that some incredible games are being released for the ps3 and bluray has won the hd war , i could not be happier  .
the bluray movie player is very good , although using the controller as the remote takes some getting used to  .
i find the menu interface is user    friendly and the graphics/sound are impressive  .
more content needs to be made available at the playstation store , especially free demos  .
when a dual    shock controller integrated with the sixaxis comes out , i will give it a 10 .
i love this system so far , i have all nintendos including a wii i waited in line for 2 hours to aquire  .
i am a die hard nontendo breed fan , and this is my first sony playstation  .
in the 80s i had an atari , then nintendo and so on , but these days it is wow  .
this sysytem offers a lot like the nintendo , but obviously more bluray  .
i have not tried the bluray yet since i only have a regular tv until i can decide on the best one for this sytem , most likely ill stay sony , i love their products , i own a high def digi cam that blows my mind with its picture quality and features more on that later  .
the ps3 has awesome features , you can buy and download older games tekken2 etc and if you do not have a mem card itll use your hdd to take its place , cool feature not on the wii  .
it has a replaceable hdd with 411 on how to replace it , neat since i own an unused 100gb one i bought for my now defunct laptop  .
the sixaxsis are very light and recharged via usb port on ps3 very awesome  .
it ha an off switch unlike the wii makes it easier to prevent accidental frying or lost games  .
more review later , but dont stop just buy one itll be worth it trust me  .
i have waited until sony released a cheaper version before purchasing  .
i would not waste $100  .
00 for 2 more usb ports , card readers , ps , ps2 gaming  .
ps and ps2 games do not look that great any way  .
i have been a playstation fan from day one and sony will get it right  .
the blu    ray player alone is worth every penny since hd dvd will be a thing of the past  .
i just bought a samsung 46 hd lcd 1080p 120hz lnt4671 and watched a blu    ray disc last night  .
it looked unreal and i'm so glad i purchased my ps3 .
this is a great system and since i have purchased have had the greatest experience using the ps3  .
since i purchased my ps3 i have uploaded tons of media using orbs media server to connect directly to my computer and upload data  .
i is able to upload all my pics , music , and movies on my ps3  .
works great with my netgear mimo router , only problem i had is my computer kept blocking the ps3 but once i allowed it , runs fast and smooth never kicks me off the only problem i hear people complain about is the ps2 backwards compatability , and for me i bought this knowing that and its not a big concern  .
i got rid of my ps2 , and simply will not play any ps2 games and as far as the hdd space thanks to cnet and other sites i have directions how to replace the hdd for a bigger hdd excellent system  .
while it doesn't yet have the games that xbox does or all the online features of the xbox live , it does seem to be catching up with each update  .
as for games , motorstorm ,  .
warhawk , unreal tournament 3 are great , though cod4 is my favorite as it's a little more strategic  .
the browser with keyboard support is helpful for looking up crap or watching youtube , checking email , or whatever  .
the cross media bar is intuitive and easy to adjust settings  .
folding@home makes you feel like your doing something good  .
i use it to watch a lot a blu    ray movies , and have it hooked up to my home theater receiver using the hdmi , flawless , well except logitech or anyone else has yet to create a bluetooth universal remote for it yet  .
i have been playing the ps3 almost exclusively since cod4 has been released  .
i have it on both the 360 and the ps3 , i bought it on the 360 just before xmas and i recieved a ps3 version from a relative  .
not much difference actually  .
do not get me wrong i love the 360 , but for the money if i is to just buy one , i'd buy the ps3 .
i have a ps3 , wii , and spent considerable time on my friends 360  .
unlike some other reviewers i will only review the consoles i have namely this one  .
anyway , this is a fantastic value for a blu    ray player , and a better value of a game system  .
i don't see the lack of backwards compatibility as a negative because it is a non    issue for me  .
i do not have a ps2 or a desire to play any ps2 games  .
there is a smaller game selection out right now and most are ports from other systems , but 08 will be where the ps3 shines (gta , mgs , gt5 , etc  .
) any issues with the ps3 not connecting to online is user error  .
the usb port issue can be resolved with a usb hub , so no big deal  .
built in wi    fi so there is no need to buy a $100 adaptor  .
it will only get better with firmware updates too .
i have no idea why xbox360 people feel the need to bash on ps3's  .
i mean do you feel threatened  .
nephew got a xbox 360 for xmas and besides it being doa (red ring of death still @ 12/2007  .
) , it's a fine system  .
i chose the sony for the blu    ray and the way it works as the center of my entertainment system easy to upgrade to a larger hard drive , wireless remote out of the box , integrated dvd player , connectivity to blue tooth devices , ability to play divx movies , a system can run linux , the list goes on i knew personally if i would have chosen a xbox 360 i would have had regrets , but i have no regrets with the ps3 yeah it cost more but i was not looking for the cheapest system out there but the best system to fit my needs .
got the system around march of last year and have been using it very frequently since then  .
sony clearly puts a lot of work into improving their platform and it shows as the system integrates new features with updates that ussually come every month or so  .
sony makes sure that every exclusive it has is top notch by working very closely with the developers  .
(lair is the exception) everything looks beautiful on an hd tv , from the music visualization to the high definition content in games , videos/pictures from the store and blu    ray movies  .
that being said , you will be missing out if you do not have a tv that supports at least 720p  .
every game i have purchased has been very good thus far , i have resistance , oblivion , motorstorm , rainbow six vegas , warhawk , skate , and call of duty 4  .
(along with other downloaded games from the playstation network  .
mortal kombat 2 rules  .
) from playing demos and checking out game reviews i have noticed that the ps3 has been getting poorly ported games from some third party developers/publishers  .
this means that some developer has created the game for the xbox or pc platform and then made a ps3 version without thouroughly adapting the game to run well on the ps3  .
before buying ea games in particular look for reviews of them on sites like ign  .
com or gamespot  .
com , or try the demos first  .
read reviews from credible sources , because right now there is a large bias against sony and the ps3  .
in closing , sony has done an amazing job on their next    generation console and has been improving with every great new exclusive game and feature .
for anybody who has purchased a big new hdtv and found they would like to get more from their investment , the ps3 40gb is all you need personally , i consider the ps3 as the very best way to view our family's digital photo collection    12 , 000+ loaded and growing  .
everything else it does is gravy , but the gravy is really good , too  .
as for photo viewing on a big screen , there is no better way of enjoying your digital photo collection  .
you can view from the ps3 hdd , memory cards , cd    rs , dvd    rs , or even connect a camera directly , then skip through them as quickly as you can click the controller button  .
copy your favories on to the hdd , or even to a usb    connected external hdd  .
select the photo you want , then zoom it to see details       with my 6 and 7 megapixel family photos , you can zoom in on faces and features instantly using the ps3 controller joysticks  .
for us , we had our photos locked up in a picassa database on our desktop , and rarely if ever saw them  .
now , we can access any of them and view them anytime note to sony    please figure out a way to share and print online similar to picassa btw    as a blu    ray and dvd player , the ps3 is great  .
new support for divx has proven that even downloaded movies look better on my big screen than on my pc monitor as for the other features of the ps3 , i find the great integration of local and online media content to be simply wonderful  .
my kids enjoy downloading free demo games and trailers from the ps store  .
we've loaded our favorite cd music and mp3s on to the hdd for listening through our 5  .
1 sound system i use the web browser on the ps3 , and enjoy viewing web content such as new sites and youtube  .
the zoom capability works well to easily view text and pictures  .
but have run into limitations , such as running out of memory or lack of flash support  .
still , it is good feature , but needs refinement , as well as more options for blutooth keyboards as for games , though it is an outstanding game platform , i would buy the ps3 even if i never intended to play one game  .
and i do not miss ps2 support  .
after seeing what standard resolution ps2 games look like on our hdtv , i will never miss the ps2 support on this ps3 unit  .
ps3 games , especially the ones optimized for free multiplayer support online , are amazing  .
granted , the xbox 360 has a better game selection today , but its lack of integrated wireless support on the console and fee    based online play stinks when compared to the ps3 in summary , the value of my hdtv purchase has been multiplied many times by the rich media capabilities provided by the ps3 .
anyone interested in getting a ps3 for free , all you have to do is refer 8 people to this site  .

i have already received 60 gig ipod by doing this , and now i want to get my ps3 before christmas  .
you can too free and easy .
i have the 360 , ps3 and wii , and when a game is developed to at least use some of the ps3's power , there is no equal  .
i have to admit that i avoid purchasing titles that are just pure crossovers from the 360 to the ps3 they just play better on the 360  .
they are getting better though ; i purchased call of duty 4 for both the ps3 and 360 , and the graphics and framerate are way better on the ps3  .
it seems that at least that title has pushed beyond the bounds of the 360  .
assassins creed and uncharted are both truly at a new level on the ps3 and are starting to show just what that machine can do  .
i do have to question where the reviewer is getting his information regarding ps2 games on the ps3 i've got dozens and have yet to run into a problem .
i is a hold out due to my loyalty to the 360 , which i loved until i had to return it for the 7th time due to the red    ring of death , and other ongoing issues  .
picked the ps3 up a few weeks ago and have not looked back since  .
the system is whisper quiet , very attractive in my stereo cabinet , games are limited for now , but that will change over time  .
some do not like the setup of the ps3 network , but it's pretty easy to navigate and free , what more could you ask for  .
coming from the xbox 360 , the controller is a bit awkward and small for my hands , but i suppose i will get use to it  .
they should also add rumble soon as possible  .
notwithstanding a few games i wish i had , the ps3 is a no    brainer over the xbox 360 with the new price .
very good value , and i'm surprised this was not released sooner    it's a smash hit  .
i bought it the day it came out and have never stopped playing it since  .
the spider man blu    ray movie is beautiful  .
i would really advice anyone fence sitting between a 360 and a wii , to just buy the ps3  .
it has changed my life forever because i no longer have one  .
i spend hours playing  .
there is one small problem with the cooling fans they are freakin loud compared to the wii , but the wii doens't even need cooling fans because there is nothing to cool the 400 dollars is kind of hard to lay down , but it is all worth it once i brought it home  .
if you're looking for the best system on the market look no further  .
the ps 3 has the best specs and is fun to play  .
if you are looking for that one really good game warhawk is the best  .
also it uses blu ray that beats hd dvd in every sense  .
it has more storage space and is about the same price  .
if game price is an issue for you as it is for me i reccomend going to half  .
com about a month after game release there price is about 39  .
99 to 29  .
the future of the ps 3 is ridiculously promising do research into home and gta 4 they look really good  .
i think if you buy a ps 3 you won't regret it take it from me i paid $599 for the 60 gb and i do not regret any of it .
i own the 60gb model and picked it up after the first price drop  .
we also own a wii for the kids and the ps3 is for me  .
the games aren't out there in abundance yet , so ps2 functionality is important to me  .
there are some great titles for the ps3 with more on the way soon  .
warhawk (exclusive) , rainbow 6 vegas , and ghost recon 2 just to name a few don't listen to the crap about limited titles  .
instead , focus on the quality of the system and what's to come  .
the 360 hardware issues are well documented and are so bad that microsoft had to extend the warranty to three years in order to keep selling them the ps3 is a completely new platform and different from anything developers have written code for before  .
there's a learning curve here , and besides , the 1st generation of games on a new console are never a true indication of the system is capable of  .
that said , sony really screwed up by removing backward compatibility with the ps2  .
the cost for that option is such a non    factor since it's an emulator on the 80gb version that i just do not see the logic i cannot forget to mention that blu    ray is clearly leading the hd format war , but even if by some ridiculous chance that pluto collides with venus and hd    dvd wins out , you still have a great gaming console and plenty of blu    ray movie titles to choose from .
i bought the 60 gb version but it overheated on day three  .
the blu    ray drive is very noisy and interfered with our movie watching experience when i returned it i got the 40 gb version and love it  .
super quiet  .
i used to be an xbox user so i do not have a library of ps2 games to worry about  .
the $100 price drop and the new lower priced edition is what convinced me to switch over platforms  .
way to go sony .
i am tired of everyone saying the ps3 has no games  .

the ps3 offers   excellent performance , quiet operation , cut price and nice design but doesn`t allow us to play ps2 games .
let me state a few facts    .
1) the whole ps3 has no games argument doesn't hold water any more  .
this console is about to hit its 1 year anniversary , and it has a ton of games out there for people to choose from , both multi    platform and exclusives  .
games like warhawk , rachet and clank , heavenly sword , resistance and the very soon to be released uncharted are awesome games to keep you busy for a while  .
notice how all of them are different types of games , branching out to many different gamers  .
multi platform games like call of duty 4 and pretty soon assassin's creed are also an option for gamers , along with many others 2) backwards compatibility is not as serious an issue as people think  .
you have to remember that the ps2 has an install base of 100 million +  .
chances are that someone who is buying a ps3 most likely has a ps2 in their household  .
if you are the kind of person that likes to have 1 system play all your playstation games , then go for the 80 gig version  .
sony is not forcing the 40 gig down your throat people  .
it's a different option  .
besides , this is a next gen console , made to play next gen games  .
refer to my previous point if you are trying to shut down the whole playstation3 has no games argument since this article is comparing the ps3 to the xbox 360 , i will do the same  .
the ps3 is going to start rolling early 2008  .
it is picking up steam as of now  .
there's no questioning it  .
when thinking about microsoft , xbox live has a great interface with very seamless compatibility with many microsoft games  .
they had plenty of time to mature , and they have done one hell of a job with it  .
this however , does not take away from the future of the ps3 online service , that of which is home  .
there's no knowing the potential and quality of the service until it is released , so judging it right now would be completely useless  .
as far as games go , metal gear solid 4 , gran turismo 5 , littlebigplanet , killzone 2 , and many other exclusive and multiplatform games are being released in 2008  .
look for gt5 and lbp to be one of the most netowork    friendly games out there across all system hopefully this does not come through as a fanboy post  .
i give credit and try to state facts where credit is due , and i will gladly back microsoft on their achievements also  .
it's just that the general perception of ps3 amongst the internet media is driving me nuts , especially the no games argument  .
it's gotta stop , and hopefully people come to a realization soon idiots are hopeless though .
this is a good system for those out there that want a ps3 at a lower cost of entry  .
yes , this model does not have backwards compatability but other models do have it  .
choice more choice for a consumer  .
that is what this is , and it is a good move ; d  .
to rate the ps3 purely as a gaming console is not fair  .
i bought it the day it is release onto the market here in australia  .
i am very happy with all it can do  .
i now spend just as much time on the ps3 as i do on my computer  .
everyday i seem to be able to discover new features  .
the upgrades to be launched in 2008 , will improve the ps3 even further  .
the lack of games is more than compensated by the wide availability of free demos available firm the sony store  .
overall very happy .
i explored both blu    ray and hd    dvd capabilities , and decided on blu    ray  .
the movie companies seem to be supporting the blu    ray format as well  .
i originally leaned towards hd    dvd , but the ps3 with a 40gb hd convinced me otherwise  .
if you do decide to go with hd    dvd buy a toshiba player ; the add on to the x    box is not up to par , and is an expensive option  .
thus if you want gaming and hd    dvd , you have to spend a million dollars  .
the ps3 has so much more to offer for the money than the x    box  .
with the ps3 you get an hd quality player that has on    line capabilities , and gaming possibilities all rolled into one  .
true the x    box has the lead in quality games , however you must remember that it has been on the market for a while  .
in addition , it seems like microsoft is always looking to the future and forgetting about its current systems ; i cannot wait to see when the x    box 3 will come out (same time as the new windows os i bet)  .
sony seems to be looking towards the future of its console while living in the present  .
the ps3 has room to grow and to become an established leader , while the x    box will have a million different versions and force their owners to purchase multiple systems  .
finally , the 40gb version of the ps3 brought the price down enough to where i can afford to make the leap to blu    ray and the next generation of gaming  .
so there you have it  .
the ps3 offers a reasonable priced system with loads of features  .
the only thing i do not like are the keyboard prices , and that the remote is not included with the system  .
but , when i brought it home and hooked it up to my samsung 40 inch 1080p lcd hd    tv , it looked awesome  .
i is surfing the web , and watching movies in no time  .
needless to say , i now have to save my pennies up to purchase a game hahahaha  .
good luck with the purchase of your new ps3 , because you will not regret it .
got it and like it  .
bought it coz needed a hd console for gaming , already owned a wii , thats good to too (big mario fan) , so picked it up to play mgs4 and cod 4 and got to watch some blu ray movies  .
waited till the format war is over and dedcided to get it after blu ray's victory  .
its bascially a blu ray player that plays games    excellent combo  .
the cheapest most versatile blue    ray player , and quickest most easiest way to get into gaming  .
but i don't like it as a blue    ray player because i'm use to using a standard tv    like controller which is not included with the 60gb system that i experienced  .
anyways , as far as gaming you wo not be disappointed .
this is insane  .
when this thing came out blu    ray players were around $1000 dollars and since blu    ray won the war , this should be well worth it for the player alone  .
next , the processor has 234million transistors  .
when this thing is released , this is the most powerful production processor , period  .
at the same time , intel released their dual    core pentium processor extreme edition , which just barely broke the 200    million    transistor mark  .
another worth it  .
it has the transformer built in , so it is stylish  .
this thing is the   , either people are cheap , or they did not know the value of this thing .
is the ps3 40gb compatible with the dual shock controller  .
somebody help me out , coz i just got my ps3 40gb today and read on the manual the dual shock controller  .
somebody help me out , coz i need ma dual shock controllers for ma ps3  .
this is a great system , although there is a lack of games for it right now  .
there is going to be a great line up for it coming up for it this coming year  .
i own 2 xbox 360's and a wii i end up using my core xbox 360 and my ps3 the most  .
but using the ps3 mostly for a blu    ray player  .
when i first got it my system crashed when first booting up but since the new 2  .
20 update i havent had a problem with it  .
overall great system , now just waiting for the games to go with it .
we have not bought any games for the machine yet , and probably wont until metal gear solid 4 comes out  .
my parents do not play video games , and i do not live with them anymore so it is pretty much just a bluray player  .
and a very good one http  //astore  .
amazon  .
com/nintendo    ds    games    products    20  .
the ps3 is a mighty fine piece of hardware  .
i purchased this after a recent trip to bestbuy in search of a sony bd player  .
the model i wanted is sold out , sigh , so i picked this up with the remote instead the ps3 performs very well as a bd player  .
the sold separately blue    tooth remote goes a long way toward making viewing movies on your ps3 a more enjoyable experience  .
i don't understand why the remote has not been included in any of the ps3 sku's so far , but do yourself a favor and pick that up too  .
only 25 bucks performance    .
the ps3 outputs 1080p movies at 24p , the same frame rate as the source material , right out of the box  .
there is little or no artifacting as a result  .
motion blur and contrast will all vary depending on what model tv you're using , but on my sony bravia everything looks beautiful  .
it's likely that on any 1080p lcd , dlp , or plasma hdtv images will be equally good  .
navigating menus is easy and responsive (when using the remote) as the ps3 reacts very quickly to any issued commands  .
the slot loader worries me a bit , i just wonder how the longevity of discs will be affected by that design gaming    .
gaming on the ps3 is still a big question mark for me , as i've yet to find any games that have that wow factor  .
this coming year promises to be a good one for sony , releases like gta  iv and devil may cry 4 give me something to look forward too , as well as all of the sony exclusives such as the new final fantasy bottom line  .
if you really want a blu ray player , and like video games , the ps3 is your best option  .
from a bd player standpoint this is one of the better units available right now  .
a growing library of games will help make this a better gaming system , but right a selection of diverse game offerings is sadly lacking .
to achieve its $400 dollar price tag , sony did away with many things , but coming from the owner of a 60gb ps3 , the main features that distinguish this product from the other consoles still remain on the 40gb ps3  .
sony threw out the vaunted cell processer , knocked of two usb ports and ps2 backwards compatibility , removed the built in memory card reader , and to top it off , downsized to a 40gb hdd  .
on the bright side , the 40gb ps3 still has blu    ray disc compatibility , free    online services (though those services are meager compared to xbox live) , wifi , web browser , intuitive interface , beautiful black finish and chrome trim (although a major fingerprint magnet , nothing a good cleaning product wo not take care of) , and psp connectivity  .
if you can live without two usb ports , no ps2 backwards compatibility , no built in memory card reader , and no cell proceseer , buy a 40gb ps3 , but know that for only $100 more , you can upgrade to a 80gb ps3 , which has four usb ports , ps2 backwards compatibility , a built in memory card reader , an 80gb hdd for all you media junkies out there , and of course the magical cell processer  .
a bonus is the spectacular game motorstorm , instead of the lousy spider man 3 ( no offense sony)  .
after all , you get what you pay for .
definitely will recommend this gadget  .
though i is planning to obtain both the x360 and the ps3 , i suffered extreme indecision on which one to purchase first  .
i wanted more than to play games , but watch movies in hd i recently purchased an hdtv , and the ps3 offered me the blue ray built in , rather than spending more for getting the x360 with the $180 add on  .
i also wanted to access the network , and unfortunately my router is not in the living room  .
with ps3's built in wi    fi , i didn't have to worry about buying another add on from the x360 which would cost even more $$$  .
i'm not listing the lack of backwards compatibility because i already own the ps2 why spend $100 more on something in which i already own  .
though ps3 lacks  good  exclusive titles (i mean lets face it , just because it's exclusive does not mean its good) the 3rd party titles is amazing in hd quality  .
i'm playing assassin's creed , and in spite of certain websites doing video comparisons of what it looks like on ps3/360 , i've learned to not solely take the word of a website author and to try it out on my own after all , watching a video screen captured is not going to give you the same quality as playing it on your own tv (and a hdtv at that)  .
i'm very pleased with my purchase .
for all its hype blu ray just does not look at clear/sharp as hd dvd does  .
sony played things right with the ps3  .
ok so sony doesn't have backward support for ps1 and ps2 games  .
i don't really see this as that big of a problem  .
i think it's actually kind of a good thing that they don't  .
i think people complaining about this point need to shutup and just buy a ps2 it's not like ps2's are really really expensive or anything  .
they continue to get updated and they are overall still a really good system  .
ps2's will play all the ps2 and ps1 games flawless and it means less wear and tear time on your new ps3  .
plus it means that you have two systems instead of one so like if you go on vacation and you don't really care to play ps3 games you can leave your expensive system at home and just take the ps2 with you another point by not supporting the other systems they take out problems they might have to fix  .
it lets them focus on improving the ps3 and making the games on it the best that they can be  .
the fact is that instead of listening to complainers complain about such and such game doesn't work on the ps3 blah blah blah they just don't offer the support saving them time and effort which is being used to improve the ps3  .
just buy a ps2 and you wo not have problems  .
jeez  .
one more point blu    ray discs  .
they hold like 40    50 gbs of data  .
so if you have digital satellite or cable and you have a digital dvr you can hook your dvr up to your computer and transfer that stuff to your computer and then blu    ray and it'll hold twice as much information as a hd    dvd that's enough for now .
a great option for those who do not have any ps2 games , or those of us that still have a functioning ps2 i love the way it upscales my existing dvd's , they looked really ugly through my old dvd player with my new lcd tv .
a lot of reviews mention that the ps3 is a great blu    ray player  .
even though today you can buy the sony bdp    s350 for less than $300 , the review of that player suggests that the ps3 is a better value  .
but those reviews are leaving out some critical information   the amount of noise that the player generates my ps3 is so noisy that it made it hard to hear movies  .
i have an awesome sound system , and of course i can easily crank the volume up to where i can hear the dialog over the ps3's fan noise       but if i do , then my neighbors can also hear every line of dialog  .
to try to get around the sound problem i first tried putting the ps3 in a more soundproof box  .
but with that approach it is hard to get enough airflow to keep the ps3 from overheating  .
(also , the the fan would more quickly kick into its loudest level 3 setting       which is still quite audible through the sound insulation  .
anyone who is seriously looking for a blu    ray player should take sound into account and buy a dedicated player like the dbp    s350 .
the games look absolutely amazing on my 1080p lcd  .
the blu    ray playback is not just some add    on to the system , it's integral to it's operation  .
it supports multiple surround sound formats and the picture quality beats anything out there  .
i is really really disappointed when i got it home and tried to play a ps2 game  .
the guy at the store said nothing about this when i asked the difference between the 40gb and 80gb version  .
one other big gripe i have is the loud cooling fan when i'm watching a blu    ray movie  .
i live in an apartment where i cannot crank the sound up really loud , and the fan noise is annoying during the quiet scenes  .
overall , it's an awesome system with multiple uses .
i kick myself , over and over  .
i usually do extensive research on things i buy for over $100  .
i hadn't heard much about the ps3 other than the blueray ability  .
i had also heard it was not selling well  .
i had been hoping toshiba would win the hd wars , but when blueray won , i waited a couple of months , compared prices , and settled on a ps3 as my blueray player for my hd tv i bought about 6 games , 20 blueray movies , an extra controller and the bluetooth remote control the blueray aspect of the ps3 is great  .
nice picture and sound  .
i have a problem with the 1080p  .
i have a 42 insignia lcd tv that supports 1080p  .
it is an early model for 1080p and i've waited til now before trying it in that mode  .
when i set the ps3 to 1080p , it doesn't work  .
1080i works fine  .
if i set the ps3 to use 1080p 24hz for movies , it works but i get strange artifacts in the picture during high speed motion  .
my tv works with a computer using 1920 x 1080 which is it's native resolution  .
so , either there is a problem with the ps3 , or with the tv , or there is a hdmi port version incompatibility or something  .
i've given up trying to figure out which it is graphics on the ps3 are great  .
no complaints  .
the games have been a big yawner though  .
the best one i've been so far is army of two  .
being a computer gamer , i expect more from a game than just button mashing  .
i want a mmorpg , and a good one at that  .
the button mashers are sweet to look at , but not much fun to play  .
zero replay value  .
some nice strategy games like c c , star craft or the like would be nice as well  .
the car racing games are nice if you can get used to that tiny little joystick  .
i still believe computer games are far superior  .
a large joystick or a mouse beat the crap out of those little tiny joysticks on console controllers easy setup , plug the network in and it just worked one thing i kick myself over though , since i didn't do any research before i bought one , i didn't realize that there were different versions  .
i bought the 40g version believing it would be ps2 compatible , which it is not  .
i did not find that out until i had owned the unit for a couple of months so it is too late to return it  .
this reduces the software library by about 95% (not counting ps1 games , which i'm sure no one wants anyway)  .
i would not have purchased this version if i had known that in advance  .
just a note about the bluetooth remote control beauty eh , works great .
ok , so it doesnt have the ability to play ps2 games  .
so what  .
i imagine that at a guess 80% of the people that bought a ps3 already own a ps2  .
and if your that desperate , go and buy a second hand one  .
they cost peanuts  .
now this console is the same as the 60/80gb versions except for the features that are missing  .
it still plays the same games to the same quality and movies  .
it still has wifi and looks exactly the same as the other to  .
im trying to figure out why so many people on here who loved the 60gb version when that came out are now scoring this version so low  .
i will say it again , as a games machine , its the same machine  .
my friend bought this version the other day , and since i have a 60gb version i decided to take a look  .
its a good working piece of kit  .
and i have noticed that alot of you appear to be having connectivity problems with your wifi  .
well ive setup five of these machines now in the uk , and i have had no problem with any of them  .
i simply read the manual of the router and that is that  .
sorry  .
my only real issue with the ps3 is the blu ray drive  .
for games it works a treat  .
but for movies , well i think unspectacular would best describe it  .
oh sure on a tv 55 or above that 1080p signal is a treat  .
but on standard 32 , 42 panels , it makes no dam difference  .
in truth it does give a better picture , but in reality my eyeball simply cannot see the difference  .
i have some very good standard dvd kit  .
and to be fair my upscaling dvd player is alittle bit better than the ps3  .
and its not down to poor cabling or a low quality tv either  .
thats one of the reason for poor sales  .
the thing can really do all the things the advertising says  .
and it really is 10 times better than dvd on paper  .
but its bit like this  .
if you wanted to buy say a whistle for refereeng a game of soccer or something  .
you would go to a shop and ask for the best and loudest whistle money could buy  .
and the shopkeeper would sell you a dog whistle  .
because it really is the loudest whistle there is  .
but the only problem is you cant hear it  .
its abit like the bluray player and your eyeball , it cant see the difference  .
i really think as time goes on , this system will only get better  .
at this point i cannot help but feeling that the product is not quite ready yet , but it looks like they are working to fix that quickly with divx support coming soon for the media features , the ability to now have your computer serve media content to your console , and the free multiplayer features and downloadable demo's  .
i'm a bit disappointed with the ps2 compatibility it's about a 50/50 chance the game will work 100% correctly , but in reality , anyone with a big ps2 game collection probably already has a ps2 console to play them on  .
the packaged game motorstorm is excellent , and lets you try out alot of the features of the system including online multiplayer races  .
the web browser is able to use a standard usb keyboard and mouse , as well has most external usb hard drives , usb flash drives , and other media if you get the 80 gb version i have not tried the blue ray capabilities of the system yet once you try this system , it makes the ps2 games look like ps1 games its hard to go back  .
hopefully as time goes on , more titles will become available for this system ratchet and clank is an excellent start , they just need to bring in some of the other popular games such as sly cooper , kingdom hearts , final fantasy or gta  .
the playstation 3 however , is much more than just a game system , and it is something to keep in mind when considering the price the ability to run ubuntu linux is also a plus , making the system a capable home computer .
but it had one flaw   the blu    ray malfunctioned after 1 year and one month  .
it should have been a drive in a socket to pull out and renew  .
or i should have bought it with extended warranty  .
this sucks big time  .
without the blu    ray    no dvd/bd play    no games play  .
i bought this system sold out on the reputed quality of the hardware    top notch processor and graphics    and on the blu    ray capabilities , but as i said this unit already broke down with very little use  .
i did some web research and it turns out this is a common problem  .
i'm sorry but i am dissapointed that these consoles (wii , ps3 and xbox360) are not being built very well  .
i still own a wii and it also broke down once , and the xbox360    which i played a lot worked fine but it is extremely noisy  .
i hated the distracting windstorm the fans would whip up every time i played or watched a movie  .
i ended up selling the xbox360 because of this something that bothered me right off the gate , and still bothers me is the glaring absence of an ir port  .
please sony , how much does it cost to add one  .
so although you can use the game controller , or have to whip an extra $25 for the bluetooth remote , it would be great to be able to use a universal remote to control your entire setup  .
this is particularly true when you are watching a movie i am sure some folks will have issues with my opinions , but this is my personal experience with the actual consoles  .
no fanboy plugs  .
i definitely would not buy another unit or upgrade this one  .
for the money , i find it a bit dissapointing .
wonder why user reviews are sometimes a lot lower than editor's reviews , now you know  .

the ps    3 still suffers from a lack of compelling titles  .
this is i think the major drawback  .
i have viewed identiclwe movie titles on both the x    box 360 with add on hd    dvd player and the ps    3 and is not impressed with a major difference that would sway the average user and with toshiba selling entry level hd players at wal    mart is this starting to go the way of vhs vs beta    max  .
too early to tell but i think i'm have seen this before  .
if sony can get some more good game titles this would be a great choice .
sure , the graphics are better and it has a lot of other features such as being a blu    ray player , but i would have been happy paying $450 for at least 2 more usb slots and an sd reader considering the 80gb system that includes all of these features will be the same price in about a month , i think they should have at least lowered the price or offer a trade    in discount for this crippled system at least my phone can hold my sd card and can be recognized as a usb device so i can still transfer files from my card i am satisfied with the graphics  .
only really got it for gt5 and some new sports games , so i cant really complain too much about the lack of features but even the $250 wii has backward compatibility , sd slot , 4 gamecube slots etc im sure sony could have managed to get a decent system for under $500 .
the sp3 blu    ray remote control   it cannot turn off the ps3  .
the worse   if the blu    ray movie is stopped for any reason (using the stop button on the remote) the movie will start over from the beginning when the play' button is used (it does not work like on any standard dvd player) .
i purchased this ps3 only for one purpose and thats to watch blue ray movies  .
i have no interest in the games  .
but i will be returning it asap  .
the picture on my ps3 is only a little better than on my old dvd player  .
but on the other hand movies that have animation and graphics the picture is fantastic  .
dont waste your time buying this if your only using it to watch movies  .
wait another year for a better quality blue ray player  .
im sure the ps3 is great for game playing .
after a solid year of being released , sony's playstation 3 still sucks  .
that phrase is harsh , but i just wanted to be dramatic for a second  .
if there is a black sheep of the gaming industry , sony has effortlessly adopted the role , and more willingly than you'd expect  .
the lackluster approach to next    generation gaming is a huge turnoff  .
the laughable stock of console exclusives make any price a joke on this console  .
spike    tv named their 2007 game of the year nominees recently , and sony didn't get a single one on the board out of the numerous categories (good job sony  .
) but besides performing poorly in the most important area of a console (being the games themselves) , the playstation 3 still sits too high above competitors for price  .
while the $400 price tag is a step in the right direction , it's still way too expensive  .
for $250 , you can pick up a wii or a core xbox 360 ($350 gets you the 20gb model and $450 gets you the 120gb model)  .
so as price vs  .
quantity , you're not fairing nearly as well as the other systems available  .
the free online portion of the gaming is appealing at first , but quickly falls short  .
what you pay for is what you get  .
performing sub    par in key areas is one thing , but failing online just drives yet another nail through sony's blique heart the one thing sony really has going for them here is blu    ray , which has pulled a little more support than hd    dvd has (but not significantly more) , so you'll be able to choose more titles with your hd movie format than with , say , the xbox 360 hd    dvd player  .
also , the player comes built in , and until microsoft decides to make the xbox 360 hd    dvd player a more affordable add    on , this remains the only major plus and makes the playstation actually worth something , even if you don't use it for gaming  .
the controller also is blocky and horribly designed  .
initially , the dual shock controllers were replaced by the boomerangs , which received more negative feedback than britney spears' personal life  .
of course , sony replaced them shortly before going to market with the dual thumb stick controllers , only without vibration  .
buyers were outraged and demanded there be vibration reinserted (sony claimed they couldn't make it work)  .
several months after release , sony got them out (making their previous statement a stupid jump    to    conclusion moment) bottom line is this   sony didn't do a good job with marketing , game exclusivity and price point this time around  .
clearly , the triumph of the playstation 2 did not carry into the playstation 3's campaign (thus far)  .
with lacking a    title games and with an angry mob of developers suggesting that sony redo the ps3 and try again , there's not a lot of room for positive here  .
although the glass    half    full approach of they have nowhere to go but up could bring solace to it's future  .
at some point , they'll have to do something truly beneficial to the console beyond new controllers or hardware changes  .
otherwise , you can find the phenominal titles of the xbox 360 like   gears of war , halo 3 , mass effect , skate , pgr4 , forza 2 , and the upcoming fable 2 and halo wars put more attention on the xbox 360 it'd be wiser to wait for sony to put out more good stuff or just leave this round to microsoft and hope sony does better next time .
i've the ps3 since day 1  .
the expensive one  .
it's a hell of a blu    ray and dvd player but it sucks at everything else  .
still i'd pay $399 for a blu    ray and i'm still hoping for some good games but this is supposed to be a game machine  .
i've only played 1 game since i bought it  .
buy an xbox 360 and let sony go maybe if they're desperate enough they'll lower the price even more  .
bottom line if you want a blu    ray player buy it  .
it's a bargain  .
if you want a hardcore game machine buy the xbox  .
if you have kids the wii is a lot of fun and cheaper  .
i even play my wii more than this thing  .
let's get some games sony  .
i bought this for my father as a bluray player and he did not even want to try and figure out how to get a movie going , he is just too intimidated there should be a plug and play mode if you want to use it exclusively for a bluray player  .
i got him a free standing pioneer in it's place and there is no problem for him if sony wants to sell this as a cheaper bluray alternative they must take care of this so not to scare off the older crowd  .
the cross media bar is bad on their tv's and it's just as bad on the ps3 .
i bought my ps3 in april 2007 , as i decided to wait out the initial hype after owning a ps2 and having a 360 i play constantly  .
since april i doubt i have 5 hrs of use with the ps3 besides all the time i have used it for to watch blu    ray's on  .
after comparing the hardware in the ps3 and the 360 (they really aren't dramatically different) individuals are much better off buying a 360  .
game selection is the main reason us gamers purchase systems , and there is only one sole sony specific game i am waiting (and have been since the ps3 went on sale) on to come out , and that is the continuation of the socom series  .
it has by far been sony's bread winner as far as game sales , and online player participation  .
with socom on the ps2 i can sadly say i spent over 2 , 000 hours yes 2 , 000 hrs playing those games  .
here it is just shy of a year later and sony does not even have a scheduled release date for the continuation of the socom series for the ps3  .
yes they are making a new one for the psp , but not for their $$ maker  .
additionally when sony does bring to the table a game that has tens of thousands of players online at a time , like they did with socom 1 , 2 , 3 they need to take as many pointers from microsoft as possible on making a seamless online playing experience  .
you get what you pay for and with sony's online being free , you'll see what i mean  .
as of now , on the few occasions when i have tried to play warhawk on my ps3 i have had nothing but problems connecting to games and when i do connect , chatting with other's is next to impossible , but i have never had one single issue with any 360 multiplayer game sony has alot to learn and hopefully with this latest price drop and the manufacturing of smaller machines (hardrive capacity wise) there will be more people purchasing and in turn maybe light a motivational fire under sony's butt and have them and their developers focus on pumping out some real games .
the pros and cons hold true for the ps3 as they did last year  .
if you want a blu    ray player , the ps3 is a great deal at any price  .
if you're looking for a polished gaming experience , you can probably find better elsewhere i personally prefer the xbox experience  .
i is hooked on it since co    op and 16 player halo1 over the lan  .
live  .
added another component that makes it very easy for me to play with friends around boston , down on the cape and across the country in seattle the wii is certainly kind goofy , but it's a positive experience that will put a smile on your face before you even get to the games just make sure you have someone else build your mii for you  .
that has resulted in quite a few laughs in the end , i find that the features you're paying for in the ps3 do not have value for me  .
that's not the case for everyone , but you have to understand that you're investing in a machine for movies first and games second  .
also , the gaming upside of the ps3 may not be a factor if the next generation of hardware arrives first also .
sony just keeps screwing up on this thing  .
despite it being a year already and there are no other great games , why eliminiate ps2 compatability    and allow orignal ps1 games to function  .
where's the logic in that  .
don't get me wrong    i admire all the technology that's in this thing (hdmi , bluetooth , bluray , etc  .
) , sony is not impressing me with a $400 unit with spiderman3 pack    in to generate sales removing ps2 hardware or software emulation compatability will just save only about $40 their lame reasoning is to force ps3 titles on you  .
do not you think that backwards compatability would entice consumers to take another look and buy the thing , knowing that they'll be on the lookout for ps3 upcoming titles  .
with sony , i guess not nintendo is on the ball  .
they kept gamecube compatability in the wii , and of course , the pricing and the controller scheme is why nintendo is #1  .
even when the great games hit , sony better learn from a year of screwing up and better get on the ball .
in the end , no matter how fun , if they system breaks shortly after buying for no reason , it's a waste of money  .
mine is adult owned , well taken care of , and it wo not play discs .
poor sony first your stuffing us with an overpriced product  .
then you take away backwards compatability not too mention your new game catalog is blah  .
but on top of that internet interface to play with others is   poor  .
i have the wii and the x    box 360 if i could get my money back and by the ps2 i would  .
what i cheap grift  .
what a major disappointment  .
i've had a 360 for about 7 months and got the red ring of death  .
if it was not such a total piece of junk , i would've liked the 360  .
so i decided to try a ps3  .
lame  .
it's noticibly slower than the 360 , although the lag in load times , etc  .
is not as bad as the ps2 (nor should it be)  .
the user menu sucks , which is well documented  .
it took about 2 hours to set up out of the box b/c the update downloads were so slow (i've got 1  .
5mb dsl)  .
and i kept getting one of the ubiquitous error codes when trying to get an update for fifa 08  .
tried ps3 support and they tried to fob me off to ea  .
what a joke  .
finally rebooted the router and that seemed to work , although you still get kicked off line constantly  .
no backwards compatability , which is really swell of sony for only $400  .
the controller is a 15 year old archaic joke  .
the 360 feels much more substantial , is ergonomcally superior , and is flat out a better gaming controller  .
all in all an outlandish disappointment for $400 .
when my dvd player started to play up a couple of months i brought a ps3 simply as a bluray player and it is not very good at that    video continually cuts out the playstation network is appalling and the games offer nothing above that of the x    box 360 major suckiness .
this is my second review of this piece of trash , bought one for my son and it is just sitting there , it is overrated , weak titles and all people talk about is blue ray , its for games not movies , internet capability i have a computer what is the point of that , sony didn't focuse on what is important and that is the games  .
i have an xbox 360 and it is worth every penny the person spent on it , great titles , and you will not be waiting for new ones , i've owned a ps and a ps2 which i still enjoy playing , i think the ps3 is released a year or 2 too early , sony knows in terms of competition there is none so the need to rush its launch really made no sense , with that being said they're product is poor and after a year still unable to compete with the competitors , the games i played did not impress me one bit  .
graphics were good but thats a given  .
until metal gear , god of war 3 , the real titles that will be exclusively on the ps3 come out  .
grab an xbox 360 or just save your money and wait for the next price drop , my xbox 360 is a gift if it was not i would just still be playing my ps2 with no problem  .
i'd give the ps2 a higher rating than i did the ps3  .
if your a constant gamer who plays daily this is not the system for you right now you will run through its entire catalog in a couple of months .
at this point the ps3 has past its year long birthday  .
but the catalog is still weak , they are still developing the software , so the point is they rushed it , we saw screen shots for meter gear a year ago still no release , it has blue ray , but why buy blue ray dvds unless u have one already that is pointless  .
with the 80gb being the only console offering ps2 compability the consumer is robbed with this decision , with no solid games available you will be on your ps2 very soon , they could have waited with the release until they really figure out what they wanted to do , the system is very powerful in terms of graphics , but i would suggest any consumer to check the catalog to make sure they are enough titles to they liking before purchasing at this point  .
with the xbox 360 running strong on all corners it is a better choice right now , and it does play former xbox games  .
ps3 is still in its infant stage .
well as i stated earlier the world of consumer electronics specifically video games is shady on its brightest day  .
after expieriencing the same problem with microsofts add on piece of garbage hd dvd i purchased a playstation 3  .
the xbox 360 hd drive likes to act like its a next gen player but has no hdmi support and does not output any next gen audio  .
however , when you look at the box the the hd dvd player comes in , its littered with these formats , leading you to believe its supported  .
you will not find anything contrasting unless your entrenched in the a/v world or have ripped out your hair trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with your reciever  .
come to find out , that both xbox 360 hd , and ps3 dont't output , that's right don't output in the next gen audio formats  .
ps3 has created a confusing little asteric in thier specs page about how the dolby true hd is converted to linear pcm multichanbel 7  .
thats great and all but it sounds bad , and thats not on the outside of the box  .
believe it or not the original dolby or dts is much better  .
i guess my main gripe is that these jerks not only tout the amazing capabilites of thier system but slap any pretty logo on the outside of thier box specifically next gen sound formats to give a false sense of security for and expensive purchase  .
many people will argue this point and say , well its aslo a gaming system  .
oh i have not noticed  .
really  .
every game shown at e3 in 05 , 06 is all cg , and we were suppossed to believe these were in game graphics  .
all that fell through the first time you played , um lets see ; lair ( huge flop) , motostorm (way short of movie quality graphics , as promised kaz  .
) , and any other game thats come out not in 1080p , and way short of the mark  .
all i can advise is that you do hours and hours of homework before you dive into any next    gen hardware purchases , becuase what you see is deffinately not what you get .
sony if you cant make a vcr wiith a dvd player in it without screwing up what surprise is this  .
it is clear sony is losing the console race by a large margin and sony is desperate  .
most customers did not want to pay $500    $600 for a console no more powerful than a $300    $400 console  .
sony thinks they can increase sales by reducing costs  .
however , something had to be dropped to decrease the cost of production  .
sony did not think the backwards compatibility is important even though many ps2 games are still being made and are still extremely popular  .
okami is voted the best game in 2006 by ign  .
it is compared to all other video games which included   wii , xbox 360 , pc and ps3 games  .
now that ps2 games are not compatible with the ps3 , the ps2 will compete with the ps3  .
since ps2 has a large library of games not compatible with this ps3 , i think customers are going to buy the ps2 instead of the ps3  .
customers can also purchase a premium xbox 360 and a ps2 for about the same cost as one 80 gb ps3  .
most of the good ps3 games are third party and made for both the xbox 360 and ps3 anyways  .
i think this is a poor attempt by sony to try and save the ps3 .
i got the unit 10 days ago along with the sony remote control  .
i opened the manual and went through the setup with several calls to customer support  .
some setup screens are hard to navigate and very poorly designed  .
had to update the system immediately the web browser is very hard to use i found that if i called playstation customer support with the same issue , i got completely different answers , but eventually found one that helped , until last night , after loading 80 audio cds , i turned on the unit and got a message that the hard disk's database will be rebuilt  .
3 calls to customer support all told me that i'd lost all my files and sony would do nothing to help me recover them  .
so i'm returning the unit i do not have time for bad products and bad service .
i bought a 60gb it is ok for a month tried to do a systems upgrade locked up at 65% called technical support had to ship it to laredo tx got it back after 14 to 20 days rehooked it up i then put in a bluray movie the player is so loud that it is hard to hear the movie called technical support placed the ear piece of the phone near the player so tech support could hear what i is talking about sent it back to laredo tx another 14 to 20 days got it back same same got fed up unhooked the player and put in the box sold it 150  .
very very disappointing maybe it is a lemon i did request for sony support to send me a 40gb to replace the 60gb well no dice  .
bought one for my son and after upgrading to 2  .
1 firmware we have a $600 paper weight  .
you are better off with xbox 360 and a nintendo wii for the price of this flop  .
face it , if you want a good hard drive , usb , hdmi , and access to ps2 games , then you have to buy the expensive model  .
for that money you can get xbox 360 and a nintendo wii and play all the popular games without being stuck with this dud  .
let's not forget the online experience too  .
sony just is not there yet  .
i took mine back after i had problems with the blue ray drive  .
i originally bought this for blue ray capability , but have since opted to go with hd dvd player  .
i will try again when ps 4 comes out .
how can you give this overpriced grill an 8  .
they cut out the one feature that is keeping it alive , namely backwards compatibility with the ps2  .
the only thing the ps3 has going for it is bluray , which is hardly a pro , more like an expensive ass add    on you are forced to buy to help sony win the next gen battle against hd dvd there are only a handful of exclusive titles , and personally i do not see anything interesting  .
the ps3 hardly qualifies as a gaming console as someone once said   video games sell consoles , not the other way around  .
i really do not like sony in fact i hate them everything they produce is so damn expensive  .
i will never , ever touch a blu    ray product , because sony is scr wing us big    time with their ridiculous high prices go to hell sony .
this is definitely not worth the money  .
it doesn't play ps2 games  .
it plays blu    ray movies , which is pretty good , for a format that may or may not win the format war  .
see , the thing here is this   the ps3 should not have had blu    ray built in , because if it loses the format war , then the ps3 is screwed  .
if the formats merge together as one , like an hd    dvblu format or something , (which is now doubtful seeing as the format and players that are made in this way are no longer being made)then the ps3's won't play the hd    dvd discs  .
if hd    dvd wins , then the ps3 is going to have a tough time , because the 360 has an hd    dvd drive add    on  .
which means if it loses , you only lose your hd movie format , not your game's format too  .
and we all know how bad it can get when your format doesn't get adopted  cough  umd  .
don't you guys see , this system is not good for an hd movie player next topic   games (or shall i say lack of them)  .
the games on the ps3 have some pretty good graphics , right  .
but when most of the 3rd party games that are also on 360 are compared to each other , you can tell the 360 looks better  .
some games however , it is not the case , like with fight night and oblivion , but , guess what  .
those games came out a year before they were released on the ps3 , so that means the developers had much more time to polish up the games  .
and the ps3 owners had to wait for their games , much like this holiday season  .
another thing is this   most of the ps3's exclusives are no longer exclusives , they are now for either 360 , wii or both (but usualy 360)  .
next topic    hardware  .
the hardware on the ps3 is pretty good , having the same amount of ram as the 360 (512 mb) , a it faster gpu and cpu , more usb ports , a much larger (and sometimes louder) case , built in wifi , etc  .
but , it's still too expensive  .
the reason why is the 40gb model is not backwards    compatible , thus is not worth it to most ps fans , so the $600 option is probably the one people are going to get  .
why does this matter  .
the ps3 is way too expensive , and they still rip you off , like the fact that the controllers initially had no rumble , until sony anounced the new ones with rumble , costing more , and making lots of people want to replace their controllers , which sux 4 people who already owned 4 controllers bottom line    not worth it  .
buy a 360 (or maybe a wii) i have both the wii and 360 , and honestly , i barely use my wii , but if you want to get it for small children , then it may be worth it , but if anyone age 12 and up wants to have some real fun , get the 360  .

This has so much value it was worth more in it's time; Lack of games. SDK costs a little too much.

At this point there are none, in the future plenty and if thats the case why buy now!; Only 80GB model has ps 2 capability, weak catalog at this point, waiting for good titles
blu-ray with all the features possible, at a low price! works well with my 50" samung 1080p, unlike my comcast hd's crappy olympics coverage! this alone is enough folks.; heck they are outnumbered in my eyes!
Constant profile updates, fast loading time, very versatile, great upconverter; Not a lot of outputs, need to pay extra to get a remote if you don't want to use PS3 controller
blu-ray, some exclusive games; No PS2 backwards compatibility, interface too complicated for the older generation (cross media bar)...... game selection not as extensive as the xbox 360, big weird bulky shape

Free access to network, great graphics, good selection of games, large focus on high definition, supports wireless networks, wide array of media capabilities, Blu-Ray support.; Some 3rd party games get ported poorly
Its plays Blue Ray movies that costs half the price of games! Waste; Price, Reason for it being made the Games, It isn't competing very we'll. not getting what you paid for at the point
Great Blue Ray Player,great all around media player for high def playback.; There are no cons for me as long as you dont want to play ps2 games but I bought it for Ps3 games
Hmmm, 10 characters of pros is hard to fill for a PS3; Buy an XBox 360 - its cheaper and you can still play most of your X-Box games
Blu-Ray is nice and retains most of the features of it's upscale cousin; Where are the great software titles. No back USB ports and no infrared remote.
lots of feature to navigate. very inetractive. bout it for my daughter and she likes it !!!!; it takes time to get used to playing some of the games. I hope Sony will work on making the games more easier to play especially for the youn ger ones
I like everything about it it is awesome. you can have Your video, pictures and music in it.; .No user-changeable optical drive! A big blunder from Sony! It could have been so easy as a drive in a laptop! But they missed it!. They made the harddrive exchangeable, but not the optical drive!
I love playing the games, and it's a really fun system to own.; In the end, no matter how fun, if they system breaks shortly after buying for no reason, it's a waste of money. Mine was adult owned, well taken care of, and it won't play discs.
Retains many features that makes the PS3 great, including Blu-ray playback, HDMI, free online services, web browser, bluetooth, superb graphics, included Spider Man 3 disc,also a $400 price tag.; No superhyped cell processer, no PS2 compatibility, only two USB ports, no built in memory card reader, and for $100 more, you can get the 80GB PS3, with PS2 compatibilty, and the game Motorstorm.
Integrated Blu-Ray DVD player, no power brick, reasonably quiet, amazing graphics; Have used it very little (adult use) and it already broke down - will not play games or DVD's. Turns out this happens a lot and to many people. Very annoying that it does not have an IR port to receive commands from a Universal Remote.
Hi-Def DVD player, no external power chord, slick interface that operates smoothly and pretty quickly, online play is free, 40GB is decent space...; Online is free...which leads to cheap support, a bit bulky due to internal power supply, controllers are last generation and unintuitive, still higher-than-needed price, poor selection of games
The PS3 is great game machine that also lets you watch Blu-Ray movies.; When I purchased mine in January '07 the PS3 was much less expensive than any other Blu-Ray player. But it draws a LOT of power when running, and consequently produces a lot of heat and generates a TON of fan noise. (not as bad as the Xbox though.)
The PS3 features IBM's "Cell" processor and a co-developed Nvidia graphics processor that makes the system able to perform two trillion calculations per second. That makes the PlayStation 3 40 times f; The machine is wonderful and *fast.* It has a little heat problem, after being on for the length of a movie it is very warm to the touch. Somewhat scared my mother, but since then she has kept it stan
I am really enjoying the PS3 as a console and blu-ray player. It has one of the fastest load times I have ever seen, and is flawless graphically and sounds superb as well with the built in hd format decoder. I went and got a second PS3 for my room.; The online is not as dependable as Xbox Live, but it is free.
Very slick look, professionally finished in all aspects, unbelievable graphics and flawless gaming and HD movies! Swappable hard drive, plays divx movies downloaded from the web, redkawa.com file server allows network transfer of files from PC. etc.; was expensive but worth it in the end, will be hard to top this in graphics though. no usb ports in the back of the machine to hide cables for devices like charge stands etc. games more expensive than competitors because they are on blueray disks.
I love that it a Blu Ray player and the games are just great and is a media player i have it hooked up to my Computer so now i play all my music and movies from it i give it a 1,000 000 out of a 1,000 000; The thing is that you cant log onto different web accounts unless you log out and sign into an different account so thats kinda bunk.
