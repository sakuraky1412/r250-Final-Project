Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .
Stunning food, amazing service .
Food Drink a little pricey in local establishments .
One local restaurant stood out for having excellent food,  Olives  located one block away .
Food was OK, service very haphazard .
Food in Pub is excellent value .
Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .
Food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered .
Food was expensive, but that is true all over London just now .
But it's great value for money, great location, pleasant staff, good food, and we'll be staying there again .
