over all i have to say this is one of samsung best phones they ever came out with .
mine had been shut in a trunk and still worked wonderfully -LRB- -LRB- .
get this if you can not afford an iphone .
i 've had several different phones and this one is my favorite so get this phone you wont be disappointed .
all the features of a smartphone for less $ $ and that 's pretty smart if you ask me .
that 's phone got everything you need today .
media net -LRB- with cv -RRB- .
mobile tv .
the next phone would be impression .
-LRB- but battery life seems weak on that phone compare to this one -RRB- .
great phone for those of us just entering the more than just making calls phone market .
had i wanted an iphone -LRB- with it 's ridiculous monthly charge -RRB- i would have purchased one .
i did not .
i wanted a nice looking phone with texting keyboard , internet capability and some extras that i could afford .
this phone offers that and much more .
i am very satisfied .
one complaint i have read said that this phone would not permit the use of the digital keyboard for inputting contacts .
mine must have an upgraded software package or something , because i am able to do so .
in fact , many of the cons i have read above i have discovered simply were not the case .
for my first touchscreen phone , it sure sets a really high standard .
there isnt much to say except that everything just works good .
i got mine on a sale at best buy for a bargain price of $ 50 .
when purchasing a new phone , i knew that i did n't want to spend the $ 20 more a month for 3g network/data plan or pay extra for the iphone minutes plan itself , i did not need the gps or other functions because the eternity can have any flash applications including google maps , youtube , games , ringtone creaters , pandora , shazam -LRB- the app that tells you what song is playing -RRB- etc .
you can turn it into a mini iphone so to say without paying the big dollars .
it 's a very smart phone for exactly what i need it for .
on top of it , the battery lasts me four days -LRB- with texting and browsing -RRB- .
i love this phone .
this phone is great for mulitimedia picture mailing .
i would highly recommend this phone .
have had this phone for 5 7 months no problems .
have dropped it multiple times .
i 've had the eternity for a few days now .
coming from the black jack , a smart phone , this phone is pretty good .
i is a hesitant about the virtual qwerty but i really enjoy it .
not very dificult to use at all .
of course there are things here and there that you need to get used to , but thats with every new phone .
i have not had any issues yet .
the camera is amazing .
takes phenonminal photos .
i dont have much use for the tv but the picture quality is , again , amazing .
overall very pleaseed with this phone .
i 'm a big fan of all samsung phones but this one is by far my favorite of all .
it is the best phone ever .
if the screen doesnt work for you , go to calibration and get a cotton swab -LRB- q tip -RRB- and press the thing .
it worked for my phone .
i hope you guys like it as much as me .
this is an excellant phone .
the next step from an iphone .
highly reccommended .
i got this online thru walmart .
com when i resigned my contract w/att .
i only paid $ 10 , which i think is a great deal .
i do n't use mobile internet , so not having to pay for that is a plus .
i do use the music player a lot , but access speed slows considerably the more you load onto it -LRB- i have an 8 gb card in it that is about half full -RRB- .
the camera takes great pictures , and the videos are pretty good too .
the call sound quality is very good i is disappointed that it did not come with the cable to transfer music , photos , etc .
, between the phone and the pc .
i ordered those from ebay , though , and they work great overall , this phone is well worth what i paid , and for my needs , it is fantastic .
it took me a few days to get used to the touch screen , and it can sometimes get a little frustrating when you think you are touching one letter and get another , but that is part of learning a new device .
is scared of touch screen idea , but i love it .
easy to manipulate .
traded impression in for this .
buy it .
looks cool , functions well .
easy to get used to .
handwriting feature is cool .
easy to care around .
slim .
loving it .
when i is looking to get a new phone i is between the eternity the vu and the iphone .
buying the eternity is one of the best decisions i could have made it is simply an awesome phone .
not exactly a smartphone out their for those business freaks but is a perfect phone for a teenager to young adult and even an older adult who wants a phone that if a blast to play with .
the phone has everything you could want and more from the camera as well as the customizable widgets and such .
i would n't be posting this review if i did not believe that this phone is truly amazing and i want anyone who is considering it to buy it .
thanks for looking at my review .
feel free to ask any questions .
i am 63 years old and never thought i would love a cell phone like a teenager , but i do .
i take it to bed with me and when i can not sleep , i plug in my earphones and watch a movie , the wheather channel , music videos , the news , or just listen to music .
i no longer take a book to read at the dr .
office , or the newspaper in the bathroom .
i take my samsung eternity .
i no longer feel like i am wasting my life standing in line or sitting in a waiting room , and it is a great phone .
put a zero in front of your key names in the address book and they pop up first and make for a good speed dial .
short and simple the samsung eternity is a better alternative to the iphone if anyone is looking towards purchasing the iphone , the eternity would be a much better choice .
i have had this phone for a few weeks now , and seem to have got the hang of pretty much all its features i think .
within a few hours of use most of its features felt like i had been using it for weeks interface and touchscreen seems to have been designed with me in mind .
great pictures for the most part with the camera -LRB- seems to auto adjust exposure when you take the pictures which is nice -RRB- .
i had been considering the iphone when i first saw the eternity , and a few key things won me over .
firstly , i use my cell phone as an mp3 player as well -LRB- why carry an additional piece of equipment if you do n't have to . -RRB-
, and i use stereo bluetooth headphones .
from what i have read the iphone does n't have a stereo bluetooth profile which surprised me .
this is confirmed by an at t associate , so unless i is getting bad information all around , that is a major strike against the iphone .
why have 16gb of storage if not in large part for music .
anyway , my sony walkman phone sounded reasonably good but the eternity blows it away in terms of sound quality for bluetooth mp3 listening .
not perfect , but very good imo .
secondly , i did n't want to commit to a huge data bill each month and to get the iphone you had to do just that .
granted , i pay $ 20 .
00 a month for unlimited data and gps , but that is a price i is happy with .
i thought i may have to forgo being able to check my work e mail as i use a pop3 connection with outlook .
my boss had the iphone and it took two weeks + as well as assistance from apple , at t , our isp at work , and two tech guys to get his iphone to sync with our mail server and outlook .
i just wanted to be able to see if i got an e mail to my work address that would require urgent attention .
i set my outlook to forward all incoming mail to my hotmail account and now i get a notification on the phone when i get a new e mail .
i can then read that e mail on the phone within a minute which is sufficient for me .
i can not open up excel , word , or other attachments , but i do n't need to when i am out and about .
so this actually works better than i had thought it would when i got the phone on the whole the phone works very well for my usage .
the call clarity is not quite as good as my old sony phone -LRB- which is by far the best of any i have had -RRB- , but it is interference free .
the 200mb of internal storage is reasonable , and although some people point to the lack of an included memory card i actually like the options of that being left up to the consumer .
some people do n't want to pay for a large amount of storage , some would toss a small storage card straight out of the box .
having removable micro sd storage is another plus to me over the iphone most of my music is on my ps3 so i is able to just plug in my card reader and transfer the songs straight to the card and put it into the phone .
i wish i did n't have to remove the battery to do so , but presumably they went this way to prevent data corruption .
battery life is pretty reasonable even with playing around with it a fair bit i do not need to necessarily plug it in every night .
video quality is pretty good , and length is only limited by storage capacity .
i threw most everything i wanted onto the phone -LRB- including a couple of full length movies , a few hundred songs , contact pics , some videos i recorded with the phone , some youtube clips , etc . -RRB-
and with a 4gb card i still have just under 1gb left on the card and 180mb on the phone .
putting the music player on shuffle even with this many files and it goes from track to track with no hesitation i have seen some people complain about the touch screen .
i have not had any touch screen devices before , but after a couple of hours playing with it i got the hang of it .
like most things there is a slight learning curve , and the fact that some screens scroll a little differently -LRB- some with allow you to quickly scroll by sliding your finger faster and they will keep scrolling which is great for longer menus , but some scroll based solely on the amount your finger is in contact with the screen -RRB- makes it a little tricky .
i still miss the odd key on the qwerty touch screen when sending a text , but even so i can send a text a lot quicker than i used to be able to .
my wife got the same phone and she seemed to have a little more trouble with the touch screen than myself at first , which mainly seemed to be because she is being a little too ` gentle ' with it when scrolling .
instead of ` dragging ' a menu she is more trying to ` flick ' the menu and as a result would end up opening up a file or sub menu it would have been nice to have included a usb data cable , but between bluetooth and the removable sd card i can live without it .
the widget interface is so so if they have some aftermarket widgets and increased customization then it would be better , but is not something critical for me .
if you want gps , web browsing , e mail -LRB- to a degree -RRB- , a solid mp3 and camers , then you could do a lot worse .
even without wi fi and applications , this phone is just a great phone to have .
i 've had it for 4 months and not once has it crashed or frozen up on me .
by far the coolest feature of the phone is one samsung did n't even know about when i talked to my rep .
this is only phone i have ever found that can play the audio for all media thru a regular bluetooth headset .
i discovered this by accident one night while using my navigation .
this is great because at work we can wear our bluetooth so i can listen to music .
also great when using navigation so i do n't have to turn the radio down to hear directions or tell my passengers to shut up .
all other bluetooth capable phones can only deliver voice calls thru an earpiece .
for mp3 and other audio you have to use stereo wired or bluetooth headphones .
i 've had an iphone and this beats it hands down .
i can insure it , i can picture message -LRB- take notes apple -RRB- , data plan is optional but half the price -LRB- $ 15 monthly -RRB- , and i can get third party music , games , ringtones , wallpaper , and the battery goes a full day for me -LRB- avg 300 text , 1 to 1 .
5 hours of internet , and some tv watching throughout the day -RRB- .
i do n't have to have two ac chargers anymore .
it 's the most accurate touch screen i 've used and i 've used em all -LRB- iphone , epix , tilt , fuze , incite -RRB- .
screen is not heat sensitive like iphone so women with nails need not worry .
camera features are plenty .
it has smile capture to sneak attack those that wo not smile , settings such as sepia , b w , water color , and negative .
i can even take a picture of mommy , print it out in black and white and let my daughter color which she loves to do .
apple take note , this is how you design a phone .
and let people insure the thing instead of sitting back raking in revenue from the unfortunate souls of those who 've broken , lost or had their iphone stolen .
make the warranty process easier .
and with all the iphone can do , who would have thought they would have forgotten something as simple as mms .
i 'm sure somewhere around the 4th generation we will see an iphone that can perform the simple task of mms .
bottom line , samsung got it right with this phone .
to all that get one , enjoy .
to those shopping , give it serious consideration before jumping on the iphone bandwagon diggin my eternity eternally , .

the phone is definitely a wonderful choiuce if you text a lot or would enjoy a phone/music player combo .
it is quite comparable to the iphone in many respects without the cost .
the cons are very minor , and i would suggest this phone to anyone .
it is absolutely wonderful .
this is my 3rd samsung phone .
i only upgrade after two years because of the discount att prices .
samsung phones seem to last a long time and are very durable .
i am a dropper and have even dropped my last samsung into a puddle .
i dries it out and it worked perfectly for another year and a half .
i have dropped this phone sveral times onto all types of flooring and concrete and it still works perfectly .
the battery is the same as my last model so i use it as a back up .
i did not even expect to get this phone .
i walked into the at t store to shop for a touchscreen phone that was not the iphone , i have the ipod touch and did n't like the qwerty keyboard that it uses .
i is looking for a phone with an actual physical qwerty keyboard because my wife texts me short questions that require long answers -RRB- .
i went in and tried out the htc models and did n't care too much for them .
they seemed so slow and the top row of qwerty keys were a little difficult for me to type on .
i tried a couple other ` cheapo ' qwerty phones , but alas , could not appreciate them .
i is about to leave the store empty handed when the salesperson showed me an samsung epix phone .
i loved it .
the only problem was , i did not like the screen 's real estate .
i loved the optical mouse and the haptic feedback screen .
i loved that you could use your finger or stylus for input .
i told the salesperson that i is interested then i got the lowdown on the pricing -LRB- it required an extra pda data package -LRB- which i expected -RRB- , and the cost is just a tad bit more than i is willing to pay .
that 's when the salesperson showed me this phone , the samsung eternity .
i played with it and i liked how quick it responded , i liked the little tool bar on the side , i loved the screens real estate , i could n't believe how good the music player sounded .
i tried texting with the full screen qwerty keyboard and is really wowed by it .
i typed two paragraphs with it and did not make one mistake .
i had made typos with the epix .
the phone did not require a pda data package -LRB- i already have the unlimited data package -RRB- which is music to my ears .
the cost is more in my range , especially after the rebate .
just simply a great multi media/messaging phone if you are a smart phone user -LRB- blackberry , palm , etc . -RRB-
, you will miss your pop/imap email .
if you can live without that , this phone is the best way to go .
it is veryt well suited for all my multi media and web browsing needs .
i can add contacts full screen with the qwerty keyboard so i 'm not sure what the reviewer means when they said , samsung eternity 's virtual keyboard is not available when entering message recipients .
if you use the names in your contacts , your good to go .
really .
i think they were reaching with that one this phone sounds absolutely great with my sony bluetooth headphones and if you want to go wired , it has the 3 .
5 mm headphone plug in the bottom line of my bottom line is .
this phone is an awesome alternative to the iphone -LRB- texting is way better with the haptic feedback -RRB- updated .
on dec 19 , 2008 .
if you are looking for a phone that has some fun extra features , but you do not need or want all extra features then this is the phone for you .
i thought the price is fair and have been so pleased with this phone from the moment i purchased it .
i probably appreciate it even more after suffering with a lg shine for 3 weeks .
it is a fun phone but not too complicated and does just what i need .
i love it .
a great phone for someone who wants an iphone but can not afford one .
i owned the iphone and the voyager .
the eternity beats them both by far .
the responsiveness of the touchscreen is amazing , this feature along blows the voyager out of the pictuire .
although the phone does not have wifi , i still think it 's better then the iphone because the data plan for the eternity is only $ 15 compared to $ 30 .
this phone the eternity that is , is the best phone out there in my opinion .
i would recommend this phone to anyone .
it has a lot of tools and features that is easy to navigate through .
i love this phone .
this is by far the best phone i have ever had -LRB- i 've had quite a few -RRB- .
the device is really easy to use and the menu system is really intuitive .
the camera is not too bad , though it lags a bit when you take photos .
i found it took a few days to get used to a touch screen keyboard , but the haptics really help and now i 'm a pro .
i do not have a data plan so i can not give comments on the browser .
overall , i 've found this phone to be very reliable and excellent quality and would recommend it if you want a sleek , cool phone that makes calls , texts easily -LRB- eventually -RRB- , but also has a really good set of multimedia features and is intuitive and fun to use .
i recieved this phone after ordering my upgrade online with att .
i is a little disappointed that the local stores did not have the phone yet afetr it is on the market for over a week the touch screen works great after i figured out to use it with my fat fingers , but i plan on getting a stylis to help me out with this .
there is no way to adjust the sensitivity on it and on some applications it seems that you need to apply more pressure to the screen than others the display is great .
nice and bright and the colors are excellent .
i have not had the oppertunity to really try out the camera yet but what i ' v tried , it seems to work pretty good i love the qwerty keyboard but there are times when i try to use it by turning the phone on its side it doesnt swithch over like it supposed to and i have to monkey with it to get it to work .
there is also a handwriting mode that is a cool feature that takes some getting use to i is dissapointed that i is not abel to set up the calendar for event that happened on the first wednesday of every month .
hopefully there will be a software change that will correct that as for the phone itself .
the sound quality is great and easy to use .
you can use the touchscreen to dial the number directly or use the contacts list .
i is dissapointed that there is no speed dialing .
you must navigate thru your contacts lists in order to get to the number you need the more i use the phone , the more i love it .
great phone , # 1 choice for iphone alternatives .
truly a step up from your standard phone at a nice price point .
everything about this phone is user friendly and surprisingly useful .
and please people stop comparing this to an i phone .
it 's like comparing apples and oranges .
this is a perfect phone for anyone like me who does n't need or want a true pda or the cost of an i phone and related plans , but still want something more than a standard phone .
this phone will not disappoint .
surfing the web is a snap with 3g i did n't buy this phone for the camera , but the 3mp pics so far are pretty decent .
there is no flash but with the nighttime setting , the pictures are n't too bad meaning you can at least see the people in the pic .
good in a pinch .
the music player has good sound and better sound than most phones .
i plan on putting a full 8gb minisd in to hold music and other files .
additionally , you can use any headset you want with the 3 .
5 mm jack .
i 've synced it with my mac 's bluetooth and no problems there at all .
in addition , my old plantronics bluetooth synced perfectly in case some are wondering , i 've loaded some .
doc and pdf files on this phone and can read them with no problems .
granted you can not edit them but then who usually does on their phone .
the user interface i find to be fast and easy .
even my non techie friend found it easy to navigate and can not wait to get one .
the battery is pretty good .
i played a lot with the phone for a full day phone calls and surfing to train the battery .
at the end of the first full day , i still had 2 out of 5 lines left on the battery the dialing pad is large and easy to read .
no more squinting .
qwerty keyboard is very easy to use and very accurate .
even using the keypad for letter entries is easy on this phone as stated in the cons above , it would be nice if the widgets and menu could be customizable although not a deal breaker the $ 15 dollar a month media net plan is a pretty good deal for surfing but i believe at t must be out of their minds to expect people to pay upwards of $ 100 extra per month for extras that really are n't necessary .
-LRB- personally , i 'll never understand the tv on a phone thing but i 'm sure there are buyers out there -RRB- .
for instance , the measly 25 channels on xm mobile is definitely not worth the $ 8 .
99 considering that a regular xm subscription is only $ 12 .
95 for hundreds of channels .
in addition , why would i pay for the cv video thing when you only get clips at a time and have to pay another 20 bucks a month to watch the office in snippets when you can download them in full length online at home and load them onto a personal media player that plays video on a larger screen .
in summary , buy this phone if you are one of those who enjoys a high quality handset with some nice options and are not in the market for a full blown pda/blackberry device .
i believe it 's everything i thought it would be .
to be honest this is the best phone i have purchased .
been with at t for a long time is this is the most advanced phone in a touch screen that is available .
my daughter has the iphone but that phone does not even come close to the features that the eternity has .
if someone sends you a text msg with a phone number attached , it comes as a link and all you do is click on it and the phone dials the number , how cool is that and easy to boot .
no more trying to remember what the number was .
phone has so many features it is hard to tell you about them all in here .
very fast internet , large screen , you can configure this phone to just about any way you desire .
in 3 days i had the blackberry bold , att quickfire -LRB- dont waste your time -RRB- and now the instinct .
get the instinct , its a amazing phone and really not that exspensive .
you wont be disappointed , believe me updated .
on nov 16 , 2008 .
this phone is too cool .
everyone just refers to it as an immitation iphone and makes me feel like i should just have the iphone , but it is cheaper and the data plan is half the price monthly .
i love the look of this phone , i find it easy to use and it does everything that i need it to .
why do i need an iphone .
i def recommend it .
if you do not want to spend the money for the iphone and its mandatory features expense then the eternity phone is the way to go you chose your features you want its a great all around phone .
have had the phone for 6 months .
love this phone , my first samsung .
is looking for an iphone alternative , since i work from home and could not justify the $ 60/month apple surcharge .
samsung eternity 's dataplan is the standard multimedia plan , $ 30 for unlimited data .
3 mp camera is good , but no anti shake or flash , so limited use by this 50ish grandma -LRB- makes me sad , because the grandkids are so cute but so fast . -RRB-
would buy it all over again .
greeeeat phone .
definitely get it .
definitely .
the thing that i have found dissatisfying about looking for a phone is all of the catches .
after going on cnet i thought that the samsung impression is the right phone for me .
but my dad already ordered me this phone .
and i couldnt be happier that he didnt spend almost a hundred dollars more for the impression even though i liked the editor 's review , i found his cons a bit decieving .
he strongly criticized its business options -LRB- even though the phone isnt supposed to be a like blackberry . -RRB-
but yet he didnt do that for the impression .
i found out that the impression has the same exact functions as the eternity , and not only that , i found out that the impression is missing one .
-LRB- i would like to thank the att employee who is truthfull with me .
lol -RRB- .
just like the blackberry is a great business phone , i found that this phone is actually the media counterpart .
-LRB- dont be alarmed when i say its just media phone , because its not like you are going to die or nothing if you get this phone and you own a busniess , or frequently do business work .
it does have apps for calendar , and memory etc .
, just not as much as the blackberry on the business side of things -RRB- i love music , and i am very particular with the type of media devices that i use for it .
the iphone has great multimedia functions , but the fact that you can only use some of the media -LRB- that you store , buy , etc -RRB- only for mac products only is a huge letdown .
not to mention it not being game system compatible .
the impression also seemed great at first too , but the propietary headphone jack is a big letdown .
i wan na use something else than just the impression headphones and if i lose the headphones , i want getting new ones to be at least cost effiicient without spending a lot of money for other devices to convert the headphones every time .
and many headphones dont sell an adapter converter this is my decision in getting a multi media phone .
it must have a great responsive touch screen with a decent call signal 2 .
the media interface must vary 3 .
and dont let it cost like 500 dollars .
-LRB- sorry upscale blackberrys , your apps arent that big enough for that type of cash , and the screen is a little small too .
its funny , because i thought that the virtual keyboard might be small , but the virtual keyboard isnt a problem at all .
i can type just as fast on it as if it were a real phone keyboard , and i have really big hands in conclusion , you might find it hard to believe that the best all around media cell phone only cost 29 dollars via upgrade , but believe it or not , it probably is .
i got luv for the iphone , but i couldnt prefer it more than this due to its limited compatibility with products outside of the mac franchise and also since you know , the main function of a phone -LRB- which is calling . -RRB-
is bad due to the known reception problems the iphone has .
so do yourself a favor , if you like an all around great multimedia cell phone , your best bet is to get an eternity .
without a laptop and newly busted cell , i needed to purchase something spectacular that would fulfill all my needs .
the samsung eternity fits that bill with only a little bit of tweaking .
i added the 4 .
2 version of opera mini as the browser .
without that , surfing the internet would be much more difficult .
the tv is only available in larger cities .
it did come in handy while i is waiting in philadelphia one day though .
crystal sharp and clear .
music videos come in clear , music is clear , but the choice may not be what you desire .
there are plenty of games to choose from if you are a gamer .
the camera is a wonder tho .
even without a flash , the imaging program can fix any darkness easily .
it 's a decent imaging program complete with frames , add ons , contrasts , warps , etc .
, very much like you would find in a program on line .
i 've used it for some shots quite successfully .
be sure to delete unwanted messages or they will back up and not allow others to come in .
the eternity can hold an 8 mg card , it 's better to use the largest you can afford .
all in all , i can not sing enough praises for it .
i own it and i still like it since it 's easy for me to text in school .
great cell phone that can easily second as a media player or pda as for at t navigation download google maps which will work same as gps should but in an instant .
this phone is easily my favorite and those opposed to buying an iphone , this is perfect .
the phone is perfectly design as it is .
some would like a qwerty keyboard , but that is coming soon as the samsung impression .
the review complains that there is no wifi on this model , but i dont feel as if its needed because the phone has 3g .
sharp phone , great music player , awesome call reception , good battery life , it 's not a pda , but as mentioned with at t everything is ala cart so by the time you 've set it up with , tv , data , gps etcetcetc it 's priced right out of the park , compared to sprint nextel , you would think that at t would get wise with features but i guess that these two companies are in very different situations thus sprint has to give away the farm while at t sits back on it 's existing base so this phone considering all of that at the price point it occupies is probably the best bang for the buck also as mentioned , the lowest radiation of any device on the market right now i do not care what anyone thinks , that 's worth the price of admission right there .
there is currently no accelerometer based games for this phone other than the dice rolling application .
fun for about 30 seconds . -RRB-
no wi fi but most people have too many access points anyway .
iphone has wi fi but does not stand alone .
you have to use it with the data plan .
misleading for apple .
this phone has a very responsive touchscreen .
not to be confused with the iphone electrical resistance sensing technology .
this is a resistive pressure sensing touchscreen that is just right when it comes to reacting to you touch .
it has the haptic feedback that makes it feel like you are pushing real buttons .
cool phone .
great phone great price .
very responsive phone that has great features .
we need to see some accelerometer based games and applications out there soon .
you will not be disappointed if you get this phone .
fyi the guy in the video is right about not being able to enter message recipients by using the full keyboard .
but he did not mention that you can handwrite it , which is a very cool feature haha i is originally looking to buy an iphone or a blackberry .
i wanted the touch screen feature , with the power of a blackberry .
since i am with at t , the blackberry storm is not available -LRB- i hate phone exclusivity -RRB- .
i had to pay retail for either one at best buy .
the iphone is way too expensive , as were the blackberry 's .
i is just about to leave the store when the samsung eternity caught my eye .
it is $ 349 , which is definitely in my price range .
i asked to play with it a little , and with 2 minutes of messing around , i bought it .
i believe this phone is better than the iphone , but just under the blackberry storm .
barely .
the video it records is outstanding in quality , and the pictures are awesome .
my house is a dead zone , yet at t still gets service , and sometimes 3g .
-LRB- verizon and t mobile failed to accomplish either one .
yes , verizon , i am calling you out .
with your no dead zones commercials .
and i never saw a large group of people following me around .
all in all , a great phone .
i love it .
if you want the awe of an iphone , or the bang of a blackberry , but do not want that extra monthly fee , choose this phone .
having this phone topped off my loyalty to samsung mobile .
having used lg -LRB- terrible -RRB- , nokia -LRB- close second -RRB- , and samsung phones before , samsung takes the cake with overall performance and quality .
for the past year i have had the blackberry pearl and i loved it and i is a little bit leary about getting a touch screen however this phone is very easy to get adjusted to and not hard to figure out .
like most reviews say , the internet or email isnt the greatest for someone is the business world , however for someone who is looking for a phone to use it for mainly texting pictures and phone i think its fantastic .
i would recommend this phone to anyone .
i would not say this is an iphone killer but it comes pretty close .
it has very few apps for download but it will run java apps so the gmail app 2 .
0 will work with this phone for those of you who use gmail .
this phone does on the other hand have light sensor that changes the screen 's brightness and contrast to make the phone easier to read and a proximity sensor that detects when the phone is close to your head during a phone call and turns off the screen and touch so that you do not accidentally press a button .
this phone is great .
the touch screen is very different than regular phones and takes some getting use to but after you 're adjusted to it , it 's awesome .
it 's an eye catching phone , everyone notices it .
camera is great .
no flash but still takes good pics in low light .
the light at the bottom is fun , and gives the phone an extra personal touch .
overall this is a great phone .
i love it .
if you get this phone and do not like it , give it a few days , because the first day or two i had it , i was not sure because it is so different than regular phones , but trust me , after you 're use to it , it 's a near perfect phone .
i love samsung at t .

overall this phone is very good .
i just upgraded from a blackjack ii with wm 6 .
although this is not a smartphone it has everything i need from a phone .
a fun and easy to use device .
the qwerty keyboard is great and very easy to use .
it is much easier to text with than the iphone .
i only have small problems with the phone .
one is the lack of applications .
while the phone does come with a good selection , many of them require a subscription .
although you can get google maps in place of att navigator .
also , the camera does not take the best of pictures , but this is a phone not a camera .
though it does have a few scene adjustments for better shots and a quite a few editing options , at least for a phone .
great phone though would take it over an iphone any day updated .
on jan 3 , 2009 .
my eternity has just arrived today in the mail .
i could only play with it for a minimal amount of time because it 's supposed to be my christmas present -RRB- .
look for my update soon when i 've been able to fully experience the device .
i like this phone because of it 's ease of use and it 's customizable home screen .
i also enjoy texting because it is very easy and there 's a t9 option on the keyboard which is helpful sometimes .
the music player is great , i like the fact that it has a headphone jack .
yeah this phone is just overall great updated .
on dec 17 , 2008 .
very sleek and attractive design .
with amazing features and great call quality .
battery is amazing .
and the features were very cool .
the eternity is a beautiful touch screen phone that stands apart due to it 's unique samsung touchwiz interface that is fast and better than the the iphone .
while not as expandable as the iphone in terms of applications , it 's built in apps plus the additions of any java app -LRB- like gmail , google maps , eventually firefox mobile in 2009 -RRB- offer almost the same flexibility .
it 's phenomenal qwerty touch keyboard is far superior to that of the iphone ; mp3 player is not quite as good , of course , but works and is the best on phone player i 've seen .
bottom line , if you like txt ing , portable e mail , and great media capability -LRB- microsd +3 .
5 mm headphone jack -RRB- , this phone will be awesome for you .
for anyone else , it is a solid talk and battery life phone , with a lot of extras you may not use , but still a solid choice .
very pleased with this phone .
i had a lg vu for two weeks before trading for this phone .
ten times better than the vu .
i just bought this phone 3 days ago and i love it .
i had a samsung sync a707 before and i really enjoyed it but i wanted to upgrade my phone .
i wanted either a blackberry or an iphone .
i thought i needed a smartphone .
i checked the reviews on the eternity the only draw back is paying for the apps and no os .
i bought it with a 30 day guarantee and thought i 'd try it out .
i am extremely to find out this phone does most things that smart phones can do .
i is able to download the gmail application -LRB- also opens attachments like word docs and pdfs -RRB- , also have mobile banking and i downloaded google maps .
the internet on this phone is only $ 15 which is a huge plus and you 're not locked in to having it .
for $ 5 more you can bundle it with the gps which is a nice added bonus because unlike google map app the at t gps gives you turn by turn directions .
this phone feels great , works way better than i could 've expected .
once you calibrate the phone to your touch , the touch screen works great too .
my main goal in switching to att from sprint is to find a phone and plan that is affordable , yet modern in technology .
after looking at nearly every phone for att and spending an insane amount of time on cnet listening to bonnie and nicole , i decided on the eternity the smoothness of the operating system reminds me of the iphone as does the user interface .
i like the taskbar on the side of the wallpaper , but it does take some getting used to .
i did like being able to take widgets off , but there is no way to customize widgets a particular app you want to use the user interface is not as smooth as the iphone , but blows windows mobile and other phones like the lg vu out of the water in spite of what ken said in his review , you can input e mail addresses and recipients in the qwerty mode .
it is not just up to the dial pad there is a very small learning curve for this phone .
basic users should be able to pick the phone up and immediately start using it without a problem .
if you are switching from a non touch screen phone you will have to get used to touching a screen instead of buttons the phone book holds a ton of information but samsung left out speed dial .
instead i have to assign people as favorites and go in two menus to find a number .
that part is not really convenient .
if there is a way around this to get speed dial , somebody please let me know many of the apps you have to pay monthly service fees for .
however , with att you do not have to have a data package on this phone .
in my opinion , this is where the eternity beats the iphone .
if you are wanting the iphone but do not want the data package , then this is a great alternative for you battery life so far is good ; i have only had it one day , but i will follow up with more information the phone feels very solid in hand and call quality and speakerphone quality has been great .
add to that the ability to reject the calls automatically from those people in your life you can not stand and you got yourself a great phone .
i would recommend it to anyone .

i have had the phone for about a week and i really think this phone beats the iphone the number 1 reason for that is the lower cost to use data but at the same time it has just about all the same features as an iphone .
i is using a lg vu but that phone lacked a proper address -LRB- could not put addresses in it -RRB- and the touch screen on the vu felt cheap and way to soft .
this phone has a more solid screen -LRB- but not glass -RRB- .
the scroll feature is very good and the keyboard make little to no mistakes .
the phone feels great in my hand and the call quality is very good internet speed is great .
i hope that there is continued support for the os with added new features .
contrary to what mr .
kent german states in his video review of the eternity , you certainly can use the virtual qwerty keyboard when entering contact information .
it works on my unit .
this is one his biggest issues with the phone and it appears to be a mistake on his part .
either his phone is defective or for some reason there is a lag in the accelerometer anyway , it is an excellent cell phone for the non smartphone crowd .
i found it fast , friendly and easy to use .
while you may not use all of its features , if this cell phone falls within the category phone you are looking for , i would recommend that you give it serious consideration .
great phone for att , its samsungs best attempt to replace the omnia on att 's line up , just wished samsung would 've included basic features such as speed and voice dial , threaded messages would 've also been great .
hope update comes soon .
this is like the samsung behold for t mobile but if you want the best touch screen phone for at t get the eternity .
the phone is great for texting , but not for internet use .
if you want a decent nothing special touch phone this is the one .
its not cool and exciting like the iphone and its not a piece of garbage like the lg vu , i love this phone because im really not on the phone that much and this phone just gets the job done .
plus the internet is blazing fast and very smooth with no glitches that ive noticed .
i like the phone , because texting on it is easy , and i like how my phone takes good pictures on it , and when you touch the phone you feel it vibrate when you touch it .
this is not as nice as an iphone but if your needs do not require an iphone and you have realistic expectations of what you are getting , this is a good phone to get .
i bought a refurbished phone 4 + months ago with no complaints so far , plus i like the original purchase price and the cost of the data plan compared to the iphone if you get this phone , i highly recommend this site .

php .
to learn how to use it and to find what apps are available for the phone and where to get them .
i think this phone is great and the 3 mega pixel camera is great and just as good as on the newer behold with a 5 mega pixel camera .
coming from a guy that has had over 100 phones this phone is great for ages 12 and up .
this is my first touch screen phone and i love it .
i 've also tested the iphone which is also a great phone but for the price , i 'll take samsung any day .
i really love this phone .
its my first touchscreen phone and im having a wonderful time with it .
i love that i can pick up this phone and figure out all of the features without having to look it up in a book .
it is so easy to navigate that you can just figure it out .
i love all of the shortcut features .
there are so many ways to get to where you want to go with just a few clicks .
sometimes the touchscreen is a bit to responsive when i am scrolling and it will click on something when i want to keep scrolling .
i have also found that the touchscreen scratches very easily .
ive had my phone for 2 weeks and it is already scratched .
i decided not to use the screen protectors as after a few days they seem cloudy and usually have lint or fingerprints on them when you try to put them on but wish i had as i have discovered several scratches on my screen .
little ones but one kinda deep in the middle of my screen .
i is bummed and went back to the screen protector even though i dont like them to much .
i also wish the qwarty keyboard is a bit bigger .
i is having trouble typing on it and is making lots of mistakes but since i have recalibrated my phone it seems to be much better .
also i is having trouble with the touchscreen not being responsive but the recalibration also took care of that issue as well .
i recommend recalibrating your phone when you get it .
i love the size of the phone and the lightness of it .
it easily fits into your pocket if you need to put it there .
i am new to widgets and the sidebar is really nice with all my things easily accessible .
i do wish you could add some other things to it that are not listed but maybe on the next model .
i dont have internet or email and such on here so i dont know how well all that stuff works .
the camera and music player are very nice .
i have taken several pictures and they all come out very nice .
the music player is also better than any ive had in the past .
its awsome .
the sound quality is very good on this phone and i have very few dropped calls .
all in all i love this phone and would buy another one updated .
on sep 27 , 2009 .
i still love this phone because it is entertainment central .
i can do everything on it -LRB- i .
music , t .
, internet -RRB- without having to switch devices .
being a teenager these things are important to have around in the hectic world .
i can take my phone with me and be able to be watching march madness without missing an important cal from my mom or financial advisor .
overall i have to say , for an entertainment junkie like myself , it 's perfect .
overall i am pleased with this phone .
my main reasons for choosing this phone are the same as the pros i listed above .
so in that regard its definitely met my expectations the cons i listed are minor , but some have been frustrating .
i thought speed dialing is more or less standard on all new cell phones .
so when looking at this phone i did n't even think to check if it is an option .
what 's extra confusing about that is that the 1 button is automatically set up as a speed dial to voicemail , but there does n't seem to be a way to set up the additional numbers as speed dial .
so the phone has the ability to do it but was not allowed for it to be used for any other numbers for some reason the call and end buttons lighting up would have been a nice future if for nothing else to be able to which is the top and which is the bottom of the phone more easily .
the phone is symmetrical all around so i sometimes accidentally pick the phone up upside down the limited ring tones is a very minor issue .
but for what you pay for the phone i simply expected more .
same deal with the not having a flash for the camera .
the 3 mega pixels are nice .
but again , for what you pay for the phone , i think a flash should have been a standard feature one problem that i am having , that may be just be limited to me , is my connectivity with my current bluetooth headset .
i currently have a motorola h700 .
i had no problems with using it with my previous phone .
but i would guess that 50 % of the calls i make using it now , the caller tells me that i am going in and out .
i 'm not completely sure if that is the fault of the phone or my headset though , so i can not list it as a major issue when you make a call , the screen stays on your contacts listing , instead of being on the dial pad .
so it can be a pain if you are calling a number where you have to enter a password , pin , etc .
you can get to the dial pad while on a call , but it 's just a pain to have to scroll to get there for those who are saying the scrolling does n't work , that 's not true .
the scrolling works fine .
they either have a defective phone or just do n't know how to do a basic scroll on the phone i also have a slight beef with cnet in regards to their battery life setting .
while the battery life does seem to be fairly good , i do n't believe it lives up the test rating cnet got for the phone .
cnet got almost 15 hours of talk time .
i do not think i 've been any where close to that rating .
so for instance they only gave the epix 4 hours of talk time .
if the eternity got 15 hours of talk time , then presumably it should go 3 to 4 times as long as the epix before having to be chrged .
anybody else noticing this too .
finally , i believe that when a reviewer is comparing it to other phones , they should make a realistic comparison to another phone in the same category .
the iphone really is not in the same category as the eternity .
so the comparisons to the iphone is kind of useless updated .
on apr 2 , 2009 .
overall i would very much reccomend the phone , i did a lot of research before buying this phone and i just moved from and htc tilt -LRB- pocket pc / smartphone sluggish interface irritated me -RRB- and from this move i is worried if a normal phone could match up to the pocket pc line , but this phone took it home .
its also got a very cool light on the bottom of the phone that illuminates when a call or message comes up fyi this phone is much better than the vu .
i just bought this phone today its realy nice and light .
the touch screen is very large i had the lg shine before and the qwerty keypad is nice to have on the phone .
what i dont like is the interface it 's not so colorful like the iphone slightly grainy besides that i really like it so far for the 4 hours i have had it lol buy it if you want the iphone but cant get it but want a touch sreen .
i walked out with this phone with in the first 10 minutes i saw it .
i love it .
it is a little pricy but in high school its all bout whats cute and cool .
i love this phone and will have it for a while .
i am amazed by everything this phone is capeable of .
no disapointmen so far .
this is the second day .
but looks like it will stay fast .
i really like the phone but am not sure if this product has a problem with battery power or if it 's me .
is anyone else experiencing battery draining with little or no use .
i have dropped this phone so many times to where the battery flies out and it still runs as smoothly as when i first purchased it .
i used to wear a protective cover but the cover tore before the phone got any damage .
i have had my phone for a little over a year and i just have a small scratch but that 's saying a lot considering i have no protective screen cover or case for it .
i have dropped this phone in small puddles of water and it has shown no damage .
the only part i do not like is how the text messages are not a continuous list , you have to constantly move from one to another and read what you wrote in the sent folder .
it takes fairly good pictures if you stand really still or if you are in very good light -LRB- best outside -RRB- .
the photo editor on the phone is nice too , it 's a very mini photoshop in the palm of your hand .
i downloaded the goolemaps app on this phone and it has been very useful , i would recommend it to anyone .
i traveled to spain this summer and it is still able to show me street views and give me directions .
i have found this to be the best phone of the 4 i have had .
i would highly recommend it for an inexpensive , chic , reliable phone .
great phone ive had it for a few months now and if the music would just work like a sony ericsson it would be perfect .
basiclly if you do n't have experience/small fingers , -LRB- and you like to text alot -RRB- do not reccomend this phone .
it can definetly be annoying , however it is pretty nice for the money .
it 's really all about the person and thier needs .
the samsung eternity has much to offer , but the iffy touch screen makes the device fall short on performance .
its multimedia abilities are plenty , and general performance is snappy .
vibrating feedback is nice , with the option to adjust the intensity or turn it off completely .
the 3mp takes nice photos , and videos are good enough for the web , though the lack of flash and auto focus kill such a high end feature .
the smile shutter works well , and the panoramic feature is great .
samsung also scored high with the 3 .
5 mm headset jack , gps , functional web browser , decent call quality , and sleek design .
it excels in battery life and display quality too a great device for all around functions , but some users may not like the touch screen performance .
this phone is good but not really for business .
good for any student .
i switched to this phone from a blackberry pearl deciding i wanted a touchscreen that was not the trendy iphone .
all in all , i debated returning the phone after being spoiled by blackberry .
in the end , i decided for a touchscreen it 's the next best phone in functionality and design to the iphone .
i like the fact there is no required data package -LRB- i .
e iphone -RRB- , and in all both monthly cost and out of pocket expense for this is much less than the iphone .
as you can tell , the iphone is my next choice , but i did n't want to be all trendy and spend a monthly fortune at the same time .
for comparison , these are some features offered that the iphone lacks .
expandable memory .
this is a major selling point as i 'd rather spend $ 40 for 8gb than $ 100 for internal memory only removable battery .
i like being able to have a backup battery since i work 12 hours shifts and can often drain a full battery web surfing , plus i 'm not then limited to an outlet during a recharge since i often have to be on the go on a moment 's notice mms .
i know this is going to be addressed with the 3 .
0 software , but it 's nice to not have to wait for it great battery life .
this is a major complaint for the iphone as it 's screen / os drain battery life .
without extensive internet use or calling , just texting , i can go through a day with only losing one or two bars of battery .
also , i noticed very little drain after 20 30 minutes calls dedicated end/send/back buttons .
i like having the option of simply going back a page or exiting entirely based on which button i use .
also , being able to access the recent call list with the send button 3mp camera .
this phone has great picture quality , with exception of low light conditions .
a flash and self portrait mirror would have been very nice to have .
i also like the wide view of the camera with simply changing from portrait to landscape layout .
panoramic is a great feature as well overall there were enough features and price points to keep me from going to the iphone , and i like the fact that everyone and their mom does n't know what phone mine is .
of course , there are cons to this as well .
many at t installed apps are locked , meaning you can not delete or hide them .
also , most of the apps will make you pay a monthly subscription to use , and become an eye sore on the menus limited gps only works with navigator -LRB- also a monthly cost -RRB- .
i became a huge fan of google maps , and found out that on the eternity it 's unable to access the gps , giving you only the cell tower triangulation to figure out where you are .
i tried navigator and found it to be very visually unpleasing , and the business search is very inaccurate or useless at times email is limited to a few providers .
i 've been using gmail and love their mobile widget , which becomes almost useless on the eternity thanks to a warning that pops up on any unauthorized application asking permission to use data -LRB- happens every time it downloads any data -RRB- .
also , the preinstalled email program has no option for a gmail account , which means i have to log on the the browser every time to check if i have email 3rd party software is practically non existent .
most programs which claims to work with j2me wo n't download , prompting unsupported content .
also , i have found next to nothing for apps that use the accelerometer or touchscreen lack of customizing .
the main menu widgets are limited to only a few preloaded apps , anything downloaded has to be accessed through the my stuff folder .
the preloaded wallpapers can not be deleted , and the screen saver image can not be changed , as well as themes do not exist for the os the browser is locked to the preset homepage , and the preloaded bookmarks can not be deleted .
while the 3g makes websites very quick to load , drop down menus are a royal pain to select on particularly when more than a few option are present for users who simply want a phone for texting and calling , there is not a better touchscreen than this .
the lack of 3rd party software and apps is frustrating , as well as the inability to delete anything preloaded that clutters up the menus .
the transitions between menus is very appealing , as well as the responsiveness the touch and the haptic feedback to let you know when you press a button .
i also like the light bar on the bottom -LRB- which can be color changed -RRB- for incoming calls / texts .
also , the adaptive brightness is useful for not having to adjust brightness constantly , although it would be nice if it dimmed a bit more in very dark locations .
overall , i like the phone as a touchscreen , and am more frustrated with the aftermarket availability and locked apps and features on the phone .
it is not nearly as user friendly as blackberry , but does very well for a touchscreen in terms of overall performance and calling / texting .
if i would have written this review , with in two weeks of owning this phone it would have been a better review .
i love the touch screen functions , texting is great , internet good , coming from the many years of the razor series , i expected better calling service and at least voice dialing , and yes you do have to pay for gps , pandora , and xm it all adds up .
the i phone gives you all of these items for free .
so for my first phone of this type not bad , for the money .
although this phone is beautiful and is a lot of fun , i ended up returning it because it failed as being a usable phone .
i think this phone would be completely unusable when driving in traffic -LRB- especially if you are in a area that requires you to be hands free -RRB- , because the only way to use the address book is to scroll through all of your contacts by hand .
some people recommend grouping your addresses so that you have several shorter lists or using a tool in the address book that lets you drag down by the first letter of the address , but both of those options require you to look at the display in order to find your exact entry .
the other options are subscribing to at t 's voice dial feature or dialing your simcard 's entry number and pressing # , but those both have issues -LRB- costing extra money or having to remember your sim card entries -RRB- i saw online that samsung has said they are working on a fix to this problem , but until one is announced i think this device is not usable as an actual phone -LRB- which for me is a deal breaker -RRB- .
i have a bluetooth radio/cd player in my honda and this phone works better than my old moto k1 updated .
on may 1 , 2009 .
i got rid of the buggy verizon wireless storm for this phone .
i looked high and low for the perfect phone , but quickly realized there is none .
i do n't really need the blackberry for business use .
i want video and at least 3 .
0 camera so iphone was not an option .
i also did not want to pay for a seperate package -LRB- i .
blackberry , iphone -RRB- .
i just wanted unlimited data and texting and a fast functional phone .
eternity is it .
its lightweight and easy to use .
well it sounds like i do not like this phone based on all the cons , but i do like it , i just think it is better for you all to see whats wrong with it , not just hear about all the good , thats samsungs job .
for a phone that advertises the ability to multitask as a .
main feature .
, not beign able to access the calendar and other tools is very disapointing .
the samsung customer support center actually told me that i had a defective phone the first time i called .
however they do not have software updates available at this time there is a multitask button on the right side of the phone .
this button will allow you to switch between tasks without exiting the current task .
the problem is that if you are on a call , the .
main menu .
icon is missing , thus there is no way to access vital tools such as the calendar while on a call .
this would not be so terrible if you could program shortcut keys .
but you can .
t do that either .
i really love the phone otherwise and hope they will have a fix soon .
if you have this phone ; please contact samsung and register a complaint i do not like the web browser and the monthly fees for apps but i really only need the phone to be a phone and a day planner .
great phone except for one problem .
updated .
on nov 24 , 2008 .
i really , really liked this phone for the first 24 hours .
it 's looks and interface are awesome .
however , during the second day of use , problems started showing up which turned into deal breakers for me the main problem is the price of the apps .
the phone is $ 199 and came with tons of apps that made it comparable to the iphone .
i liked the form factor much better and wanted to avoid the pricier data plan of the iphone .
however , since literally 90 % of the apps on the eternity charge monthly subscription fees -LRB- yeah the phone has gps and mobile tv , but gps runs $ 10/month and you pay per channel for the mobile tv -RRB- , and the exact same apps -LRB- with better interface -RRB- are free on the iphone or a small one time fee , i 'm actually going to save money with it .
it comes pre loaded with tons of apps and you get home excited to use them all , then find out they are just demos and that you have to subscribe to them all .
a huge downer the browser is also very , very hit or miss .
some pages look great , some pages are crammed into a weird column format and do not really give you a great browsing experience .
being able to surf in portrait or landscape is nice , but in the few days i 've had the phone , the accelerometer is already having trouble recognizing when i have the phone turned .
i called at t and they recommended trying the operamini browser , which is somewhat better , but does not navigate on this phone as well , and it appears that the phone refuses to go into landscape with it the touchwiz interface is cool , with haptic feedback and the drag and drop rail on the homescreen .
however , the widgets on the rail are preset to fairly useless things .
birthday reminders , a world clock , a regular clock , an alarm , a calculator how about a browser link .
a messaging link .
an apps link .
the text messaging on the phone is a definite strong point , but threaded texting would have been a great touch .
the virtual keyboard seems to be more reliable to me with more options -LRB- t9 , multitap , landscape , handwriting -RRB- than others that i have seen overall it 's a really , really cool phone that i wanted to love , but the deeper i got into the phone the more it feel short of expectations for the price point .
we all know what you can get for $ 199 on the cell phone market these days .
if you want a really $ 199 phone to check email , look cool , and make calls this is the phone for you .
if you want $ 199 phone to do more than that , i think there are better options .
it would be a better phone if the software would work properly and if the touch screen would respond better .
with a few simple changes , this would be a camera/phone i would give an unqualified endorsement .
as it is , i will stick to my iphone .
the biggest downfall is the speed dial feature .
samsung really should have a fix for this phone by now , it 's been out more than four years it looks like .
updated .
on sep 11 , 2009 .
overall , i really like the phone .
i have recommended it to several people .
it has many great features and the battery life is very impressive .
the touch screen is very responsive and that helps with texting .
i own this phone since 01/04/09 and i am very happy with what i got for the money i spend .
i got this phone as an all in one replacement for my last phone .
i use it for business and personal use , so i wanted a phone with everything .
at first glance , this phone seemed to be it it has a camera , mms capabilities , g3 internet , a calendar , alarm , and so on .
however , after a month of use , my frustrations with the function of the phone were too great the main issue is that of call quality i got many complaints from people i spoke with .
my last phone , a sony ericsson 810i is great , and once i switched , i had people saying they could n't hear me , and a few times i 'd make a call , and all i 'd hear is a person saying hello .
hello .
while i 'd be yelling to be heard on my end .
it is totally unprofessional and i can not have a phone that does n't make clear calls , period part of my job involves taking photos and sending them via mms .
with this camera , all of my shots were blurry , unless i sat the camera on a stable surface like a table , and then took the shot .
however , that wo not work for me since i 'm outdoors most of the time , and i need to take photos on the fly .
i am not an apple user and wanted to stay loyal to samsung .
however , i have been dissappointed since upgrading from my slider .
the eternity does not let me know i have a new text/voicemail message until i unlock it , which has me unlock it everytime i leave my phone and return , to make sure i have n't missed a call .
i work in a loud industrial environment and require a distinct ringer in order for me to hear it .
unfortunately , i do n't care to have people hear my taste in music when my phone rings and the basic ringer is nearly inaudible with other noise present .
if i did n't mind people hearing my taste , at t wo not allow vh do be installed on the eternity .
finally , the apps at t has for business and productivity are not compatible for the eternity , only online banking , which again , my bank is not listed -LRB- bof a .
i have returned the phone to the at t store and will hopefully be more happy after trying the epix instead .
a good texting and browsing phone that wo n't cost you additional smart phone data fees .
most of the added on features are just trying to show off sponsored software and do not let you get to the parts of the phone you actually want to use .
slim and sleek , .
but if you r a email person .
this is not the phone for you .
texting and calling , camera these are the only functional features in this phone .
i bought this phone 3 days back and i am not happy with it updated .
on dec 23 , 2008 .
i would recommend this phone to someonewho wanted a little more than a basic phone but not wanting to pay the price for the iphone .
the $ 15 monthly charge for the media net is worth it , but do n't overly excited about the surfing capabilities , this is not a blackberry .
the tv apps are nice but $ $ $ $ $ $ and the xm radio is very limited in the channels you get .
if these are the types of apps you are looking for then phone is not for you .
you would be paying over $ 100/month just in subscription costs .
if you could afford that , then i would , without a doubt , recommend the iphone if you are a huge techie person like me , i think you may be a little disappointed .
my wife on the other hand , who is not a techie person , simply loves it .
overall i would recommend this phone if you do not mind paying the price .
i would think though they could at least provide an ear bud for the price you pay .
all the phone comes with is a home charger and cd it took me less than an hour to set up all my bookmarks , edit my contacts , set up the gps and sync my bluetooth , without ever having to refer to the documentation , so it is very easy to use .
battery life seems pretty good as well .
i 've ony charged mine once in 3 days in summary if you are looking for good call quality , battery life , ease of setup , texting , basic email support and basic surfing via media net then you will be happy .
man i really wanted to like this phone after comming from a pda .
this has to be the 1st phone i have seen that does not have a listing for mobile or cell phone under contacts just a listing of home , fax or ect .
hard to remember sometimes the cell number when your sending a text on wich is the cell # .
i can not figure out how to remove a photo from contacts except to delete contact and start over no light on call or end button .
when you put an event in the calender it will not show up under the event widget in the widget bar .
somtimes i have to hit the contact call button several times for it to work .
this phone is good for someone who is rough on their phone , but still wants a cool touch screen phone .
i have dropped it on pavement , into water , and even down the stairs , and it still works fine .
however , the touch screen can be very frustrating , especially when typing updated .
on nov 1 , 2010 .
i received my samsung eternity as a birthday gift in july , an is totally pleased with it , after the 30 day period is up the phone restarted on me twice , but i thought nothing of it until 4 months later when the phone stop vibrating , an the screen became hard to press an unresponsive .
i than proceeded to calling at t to be sent a refurbished eternity , within less than a month the eternity refuses to call out an deleted all my contacts , i thought it is just a problem with my sim card , in all my old cell phones the sim card works perfectly .
i 'm about to call at t to ask for a different phone because this will be my third eternity i will receive .
i 'm highly disappointed in this product as i really did enjoy it until it started these 's problems .
i also noticed that other reviews make it seem like its the best phone you can get .
i am really happy that they discontinued this phone so no one else will have to be put through such problems .
this is a good texting and internet/multimedia phone .
it has a decent mp3 player and is good as long as it isnt defective .
one of the better touch screen phones out there when it comes down to how the phones features function , however , i have experienced problems with the phone on numerous occations about recieving text messages on time the phone goes through spells where it will send multiple texts to everyone and it will not recieve the texts until hours later .
the overall i can say it is good for the phone and camera .
the text message is good .
no wifi option , the internet lags and blocky at times .
no help from samsung for the updates on the phone there is a malware on the pc suite for the phone it has a porn site linked to the drivers and the pc suite crashes when opened .
the touch screen has problems with touch and sensitivity issues , the calibrate function not useful .
has a good battery .
the phone is good overall but for what i paid for it i 'm considering taking it back .
the phone has constant volume issues i can not hear it ring most of the time even on high .
and i 'm constantly having people say they can not hear me .
i am definatly considering getting another one and i 've had this one for less then a month .
this phone does not permit the personalization that i am used to .
the razr may be passe but it had better options in terms of making a cell phone your own .
great having emoticons easily accessible and swapping between keyboards is easy .
cant imagine anyone liking the widgets or the logistics necessary to get where you want to go in this phone .
i is totally taken with it in the store and my cousin loves hers but after several days ' use i am pretty frustrated .
a frozen screen really stinks and the muffled sound reported by all my call recipients is a total deal killer .
if the sound can not be adjusted to be more clear , i am returning the phone and starting over .
i love this thing .
i 'm just a little hesitant to call it a phone .
thank god 911 is so easy to dial because in an emergency otherwise you 're sol .
if there 's a trick to scrolling through contacts , i 'd love it if someone would share it updated .
on apr 16 , 2009 .
not hands free compatible .
no voice dialing .
the battery goes fast when playing music or browsing the net .
address book lacks a quick go to option to get to a specific contact .
use the volume buttons , scroll the touch screen , or use the power search tab , which goes to the beginning of each letter in the alphabet .
the talk/send , back , power/end buttons are smooth and do n't light up in the dark no ability to copy , cut , paste text in the address book or anywhere else on the phone .
no option to set the default folder for photos , ringtones , and answer tones or the photo widget .
when assigning a photo to a contact , a copy is stored in the general default folder with the wallpaper photos .
the same goes for ringtones and answer tones .
if you move the photo/tone to another folder the connection is broken in the contact and the path does not update automatically .
there is also no option to assign a single keypad number to dial for a contact , but # 1 is assigned to voicemail .
the address book does n't have a state field , only address , zip , and city ; city appears after the zip .
only one illumination color for all calls , messages , or alarms at a time .
can .
t assign a different color for contacts .
when pressing the call button , a list of recent calls opens allowing a call to the last number .
however , you can not access the contact list or assigned groups from there when viewing a list in the contacts/address book , the volume buttons will jump to the next page but not to the next item in the list ; must touch the screen .
after placing or ending the call , the address book screen does n't return to the .
main .
screen automatically .
fields in the address book are limited when saving to the sim card/phone , but there are numerous options when saving to the memory card when the keypad is locked , the wallpaper that appears is not the same that appears when it is unlocked .
there is no option to change that and it rotates on its own every so often .
while on a call , you can not view the main menu .
however , you can access the address book .
the call button does not work from the main menu yet you can connect to the internet and send text messages the cover and battery must be removed to access the memory card .
you can not delete individual calendar of events when they are recurring .
doing so will delete all the events associated with it .
the events widget is misleading ; it does not show the days ' events , it shows missed calls and messages .
when creating an event or task , the title and detail fields are limited on space and there is no option to include a note .
the amount of text is also limited in a note .
when setting the start/end time and date for an event or task , you have to scroll through the numbers for the time and date .
there is no calendar view w/days when setting up a recurring event .
the year defaults to 2030 .
there is no option for setting a number of times or specific days to repeat , unlike what the alarm can do the multitask key opens the multitask menu but it does n't close it .
there is no option to customize the widget bar outside of what the carrier and manufacturer provided the medianet settings are not accessible and there is no way of locking internet access on a temporary basis .
there is also no option to get a prompt to access the internet to avoid connecting automatically .
while online , the ability to turn the volume up or down or switch to speakerphone is disabled .
while on a call , there is no option to switch from the phone to the earpiece ; only from the speaker to the earpiece .
however , there is no option to transfer the call from the earpiece to the phone unless it goes to the speaker the music player is disappointing and very basic ; there is no true equalizer when minimized , just presets when maximized viewing a song .
there are volume buttons on the side of the phone but no buttons for pause/play , stop , or forward/back .
they are only available from the touch screen .
the music player does not highlight the currently playing song in the playlist during play mode .
when skipping around songs in a playlist , the music player won .
t remember the last song played before it , it will play the song that appears before it in the list .
the music player does not have an option to assign the folder to play from so answer tones appear in all music , unless you open a playlists .
playlists must be created from within the music player , but once it is created , multiple songs can .
t be added later , only one at a time when viewing/playing each song .
the phone itself is good , however i have a bad taste about it because , i drop calls every day in my home and work location , and while driving to and from work .
the phone does not accept calls at my house or work due to the horrible at t service in my location .
when i am 40 miles north or south of home the phone works great , again not a phone problem but an att problem .
i really like this phone and would like to keep it but it has a fade problem that bugs the hell out of me .
the ring tone fades in no matter how you set it .
when i call someone the connection tone , fades in on every ring .
when someone answers , the voice fades in and out .
i 've tried and tested this in multiple situations and it just keeps fading .
my wife has the same phone .
it 's a fader too .
oh , we had to replace her phone within an hour caused it had an incurable crash the headphone jack comes out the side which is kind of a pain if you want it to sit comfortably in your pocket .
you can get phones with a 90 degree plug , but that 's a hassle so , as much as i dig this phone , i think i 'm going to return it before my thirty days run out .
unless someone knows how to fix the problem .
great phone but wireless tv coverage is very limited and does not work as advertised .
im working on my 6th day with customer support to get it functioning .
internet s l o w as can be .
poor signal strenght compared to i phone .
currently no way to connect to your pc for downloads .
samsung is working on it and i and several others are working with a top tier engineer at samsung to find a work around .
bottom line .
if you have a snooze type job -LRB- like i do -RRB- and you want to wat5ch tv discreetly this is the one for you -LRB- maybe , due to poor coverage area -RRB- if you want a phone with internet access , videos , and a real way to download videos / music to it , get an i phone .
bottom lines is this , since i 've taken this phone back to the store and gotten an iphone , the eternity does not come close to the iphone .
if your new to touch and want a beginner phone with a few advanced features then this is the phone for you updated .
on dec 5 , 2008 .
if you do not text a lot it 's a great phone but bottom line the texting is not very good .
the calibration sucks you have to press the + exactly where it shows up at or it cant be calibrated so if the touch is off send it in for replacement .
the t9 is about the worst piece of crap i 've ever seen in my life .
if you type home and want good wants you change it and put a period or question mark your good turns to home .
its the worst programming ive ever seen .
if you turn off the ascending ringtone the ringtone continues to ascend .
and no support or updates from samsung .
the microphone is too low during calls and you have to hack it to be heard on the phone your calling to bottom line the phone would have been great if they would have programmed it correctly .
does n't sync with mac computers i have not been able to find a fix .
it 's totally unclear to me as a developer why this should be the case .
the proprietary window 's sync software is unstable and clunky it crashes , freezes , and slows down without warning , sometimes taking phone data with it .
error messages are barely in english and totally unhelpful .
already on a new phone after 4 months of using this one .
the touch screen stopped reacting at all .
it just was not all it is made out to be in the end .
very frustrating to waist an upgrade on this phone .
i loved this phone and all of it 's features at first , but i 've had to replace it twice now under warranty and am still having the same problems .
very frustrating .
the phone freezes up at least twice a day on me and restarts itself , usually when accessing mobile email and/or when using the camera i am in the process of looking for a new phone to replace this one .
i 'm tired of the issues .
bottom line do n't buy it i 've been really unhappy with my eternity , which i 've had for about two months .
i bought this phone after doing quite a bit of research .
the eternity seemed to have good reviews from both critics and users , and it had the functionality i is looking for .
i wanted a phone with either a qwerty keyboard or a touch screen , because i hate texting with a numeric keypad i like the eternity .
s contacts application .
it provides a lot of different fields so you can store quite a bit of information about each contact .
it also allows you to create groups and a favorites list , which is helpful if you have a large number of contacts stored in your phone in theory , the eternity has everything i could possibly want touch screen qwerty , 3 megapixel camera , good call quality , online access , mobile email , music player , and tv access -LRB- though i can .
t use it where i live i have been able to use it in bigger cities -RRB- .
in practice , the touch screen is so inaccurate that nothing works very well .
the calibration function does not work , and neither does the vibration feedback to make matters worse , the samsung website has dead links all over the place , and when i emailed customer service , i got a generic response that did n't answer my questions i would not buy a samsung product again .
my personal opinion is that this i must have a touch screen cell phone day in age needs to either produce a good touch screen phone other than the iphone , or it needs to stop being a necessity in today 's phones .
i can say i will compare the eternity to an iphone as really i think most people that buy it are doing it because it is one of the iphone alternatives .
i 've personally played with the iphone and i think it is really awesome , but the overpriced att data plan and the poor vertical text messaging feature just really detracts from everything else about that phone .
this samsung has too many problems though first the screen is finicky .
you go to your contacts and it is hard just to get the darn thing to scroll without instead clicking on a contact and going to their information .
you see this similar problem while browsing the web with the samsung .
for some reason i think the iphone nailed the touch screen usability , but the touch screen just does n't work well with the samsung , at all .
text messaging is not tough on the keyboard but it 's a pain in the rear to turn it sideways then back vertical , see you made a mistake , turn it sideways again , etc .
you will definitely need both hands to write on this thing , so be ready to put that drink down or do n't even think about using it while you are driving unless you are going to text the old fashioned non qwerty way .
i feel confident this is why apple never made the iphone capable of sideways texting , although i find the iphone 's qwerty far too cramped .
so , pick your poison call quality is not excellent by any means , and call volume is atrocious .
if you are ever in a bar or any loud place and need to make a call , seriously , do n't expect to hear the person on the other end at all .
it is really that bad or i am deaf .
altogether i can say that the iphone is superior as a touch screen phone .
imo , go with a regular non touch screen phone if you do n't need one , otherwise the iphone is going to be your best bet if you can get over the fact that you will pay double for a data package that would be cheaper with any other phone you could purchase through att .
i went back to my original blackjack 1 -LRB- also a samsung -RRB- and i can not say enough how inferior the new eternity is to the blackjack .
if you are buying for a touch screen only , just be ready some disappointment in usability .
and do not make the mistake i did and purchase and then go back in to att to return and get charged a $ 20 restock fee they failed to mention to you when you first picked the phone up for purchase .
my old $ 30 nokia flip phone worked great for 2 years and is still working when i decided to upgrade .
i chose the samsung eternity based on its published very low emissions rating .
i am not sure about the emissions , but i am sure about it 's poor quality , as this phone turned out to be a downgrade .
after about 8 months , the touch screen stopped working properly .
i would touch one letter or number and the screen would highlight a different character repeatedly .
it got so bad that for numbers that i do not already have saved in memory , sometimes , but not always , it takes 10 15 attempts and up to half an hour to dial the entire number successfully .
not to mention cases when several numbers must be dialed sequentially , such as when accessing a bank account where you need to enter account number , then ss , then password , this may take over an hour to dial all numbers without error , because after each error you must restart the whole sequence all over again .
this is not an issue of having large fingers that cover more than one character .
even using a pencil tip to dial i get the same result , as if the phone got crazy .
sometimes the screen highlights another character two or more spaces away from the one being pressed .
and worst of all , this behavior is all erratic .
it may work fine for a few days and then starts this crazy behavior for another few days .
absolutely frustrating .
luckily , i only use the phone to make calls , but i can imagine the frustration of trying to use this for email or internet .
good phone , as long as you do not mind the glitches .
i 've had 3 of these phones -LRB- each time i return it , they give me another eternity -RRB- and encountered the same problems .
calls drop constantly and have have to activate bluetooth again several times on it 's own .
then att will not send out new phone or give credit towards a new one .
they will send out a refurburshed phone that has the same issues .
i had to return this phone 5 times to at t and i ended up having to get a new phone .
it would freeze , turn itself off , crack screen very easily , and wo not have a good connection to internet .
i is very diappointed with the price for what i got .
this phone is no good date september 21 , 2009 .
it does not have a speed dail .
the meuns are way out of order .
it is very hard to get the hang of answering the phone .
i acciedntlly hang up on people 75 % of the time .
the key pad is locked will drive you crazy .
please let samsung know that this kind of phone will not cut it .
if you need a phone to hold your breath here make phone calls or write text messages this is not the phone for you .
no speed dial or short cuts means you have to go through the entire menu to make a phone call .
i found myself having to press like 85 buttons just to make a simple call .
texting is no better .
it sucks when you receive a text message and the phone does not unlock -LRB- like it does when you receive a call -RRB- ; and there are no options to change the lenght of time it takes for the phone to lock which is annoying .
while there are several options for differing vibrations for calls/texts , none of them are the normal vibration that most of us are accustomed to .
overall , making phone calls or sending/receiving texts become too troublesome and annoying so i returned the phone .
in addition to a lack of , what i would call , basic features -LRB- no speed dial . -RRB-
, the phone had its own issues .
itwould constantly freeze , when a text is received , i had to press view like 10 times to actually view the message , and several times , when i would want to place a call , the call would immediately end before it would even ring .
this phone sucks .
i is very disappointed with this phone in the long run , i use my phone all day long and many times am outside of the city and have no service .
the touch screen breaking under normal use is also a big disappointment , normal everyday use caused the screen to cease function -LRB- which is not covered under warranty -RRB- .
i tried for 3 weeks to get used to this phone .
it 's a wan na be .
when i 'm ready for and need a blackberry or i phone , then i will get one but i 'd rather just have a phone than hasle with the eternity wan na be .
my first major issue is that i could not speed dial to reach my family members .
i went from a phone where it took two pushes of a button , which could be done by touch without looking at the screen , to the eternity which took an eternity to get to my family members 7 pushes of a touch screen , which requires actually looking at the screen to find and push the right button .
unacceptable to me .
also , while i is paying for connectivity , the websites that i would have liked to use -LRB- facebook , mapquest or other map site , pandora -RRB- were not available through this phone .
so , why am i paying for connectivity .
this experience is a good lesson touch screens are not for me at this stage of my life .
i went to a slider phone with a qwerty keyboard and am so much happier .
buy an iphone .
anyone that reviews a phone should have to have it for a while before making a review .
this phone is cool at first but after using it for a while i am tired of the dropped calls , the low signal strength and the poor call quality .
i feel like i am back in my analog days .
my previous phone is a motorola and is a much better phone in regards to call quality and signal strength .
i think this phone has all the makings of a great phone but i regret buying it .
i need to get my calls .
you can see you missed a call and clear it only to get another call later and the phone remind you that you missed the previous call .
it will do this all day long .
get off my screen alreay .
with all the widgets on the main screen you can not add a message button .
you have to go to menu and press another button to text message , all the while bluetoothing is on the main screen , this is foolish .
how oftern do you turn on and off bluetooth compared to texting .
i loved the phone at first but the worst thing is the bars , way fewer bars in way more places .
i do take some of the blame ; i is foolish not to carry insurance i thought 5 bucks a mo pays for a new phone after two years .
my bad .
who knew i `` d need it in six months , however is it a coincidence phone completely died in two years and one week on a two year contract .
btw , att did not honor its rebate offer blamed 3rd party contractor .
my negativity towards att must sound like sour grapes .
i 'm sitting here without a phone , shopping for a new one .
it 's all minutia in the scheme of things .
caveat emptor .
the touch screen is really hard to use , particularly if you want to scroll the screen using touch screen .
the sliding always leads you to an unintended screen .
also , if you press number 1 key on screen you may actually dial the key 8 .
even worse , if you want to call someone using the saved contact list , the phone can automatically jump to someone else in the list and you actually end up calling someone i do not intend to call do not buy it .
when texting you must have a stylus or a small stick to text , if not the phone picks up every letter around the letter you wanted .
the predictive text is like trying to have a drunk person picking words you want to use .
i bought this phone in sept .
'09 .
it is now , november , a mere 2 months later , and i am on the fourth phone .
i keep sending them back because they keep resetting themselves in the middle of my phone conversations .
it is impossible to conduct business on this phone because of this problem .
at t claims they know nothing of this problem with samsung eternity 's , but i beg to differ .
four completely different phones doing the same thing poor construction in the brand .
i am thoroughly disappointed .
this is the worst electronics instrument i have ever owned .
all of my friends bought iphones , and i decided to try something different .
now i 'm going to go get an iphone first , it sucks as a phone .
the sound quality on both ends is best summed up by the most often uttered word .
what .
you can not decipher what people are saying .
it goes completely silent between words , like a bad voip connection .
people think i have hung up on them .
my last conversation ended with the person on the other end saying are you still there .
hello .
click so what else does it manage to screw up .
well , lets take something simple like the alarm clock .
i travel a lot for work and use my phone as an alarm clock .
this does n't work out so well now , because this phone has a unique function that i 'll call the optional snooze .
see , sometimes when you hit snooze , the alarm comes back on in 10 minutes like it 's supposed to .
other times , it just turns off .
sometimes it looks like it does n't turn off -LRB- i can still see the alarm icon -RRB- , but then it turns off by itself 5 minutes later while i 'm asleep .
then i wake up in a panic and rush to the airport to probably miss my plane .
i hate this phone and not only do i hate this phone , all of my friends hate this phone .
because they can not understand what the hell i 'm saying anymore when i talk to them .
i 'd blame this on at t , but my last phone with them worked great .
and it is a cheap nokia it is able to connect to the internet , but the touch screen is set -LRB- by whatever mood the phone is in -RRB- to either ` too sensitive ' or ` not sensitive enough ' , so that you either accidentally follow links to god knows what , or almost have to punch the phone with your fist to activate a link hmm what else it looks so much like an iphone that i guess i 'm automatically a poser just for owning it .
that sucks , too .
but not as much as this phone sucks i give up .
i could spend the time i 'd spend complaining about this thing better while in line at the apple store avoid this phone .
unless you do not actually need a phone and just want to look cool .
i got this phone for my girlfriend , and when ever i talk to her on the phone , she 's really softer than usual .
my other friend with the same type of phone seems fine though , just once he sounded really soft .
features are great for the price , but call quality needs improvement .
this product has a serious defect .
please spread the word around .
caveat emperor .
it is seemingly dubious in the way they handle this problem .
the pain of spending two ours of our time .
is it too much kindness , that att and samsung should admit that the phone , model # sgh a867 is having problems .
this is not a slam on any of their other products .
i will not suggest this phone to any one .
how can an unusable phone get a rating like this one .
i have had at t/cingular for over 8 years .
this is the worst phone i have ever encountered through them .
i would never recommend this to anyone for any reason .
i generally think everything everything has its merits for some user .
i honestly can not say this about this phone .
i do not just think it is the one i got either .
my wife has one too and hates it just as much .
i do n't understand why this thing is compared to the iphone in its review .
they are in no way , shape or form comparable ; especially screen wise .
the resistive screen is resistive .
i have to pretty much stab it to get anything done .
even worse , it is not at all accurate and refuses to calibrate .
even worse , it is inaccurate to different degrees in varying areas of the screen .
when people ask to use my phone , i have to say no but i can dial for them because it 's that bad .
also , the resistive layer scratches from normal use .
i have never dropped this phone on the screen or scratched it with my fingernails , the layer just wears out on its own over time creating 2 fuzzy spots where i usually scroll another thing i do n't understand is how this thing can be considered a good media player .
it lags , it does n't properly read metadata , it has very limited features and is just overall abysmal .
i will say that the built in eqs are rather nice though .
i would however prefer to make my own the keyboard terrible .
the iphone 's is a breakthrough in touchscreen typing .
this is an abortion of software due in no small part to the terrible touch tracking i 'm not sure how you qualify touchwiz as an interface all it is are some largely useless widgets on a tiny homescreen .
it would be cool if i could link browser favorites to it but i can not email is not pushed and therefore useless .
not to mention the app does not support most email domains medianet is a terrible piece of software but i downloaded opera mini which is adequate it feels cheaply made the camera lags and has some sort of noise reduction that completely robs pictures of any detail .
the white balance settings are surprisingly functional though and the panorama mode is a nice touch -LRB- however the pictures taken are very small -RRB- i could go on for days but the bottom line is this phone is terrible , as are most samsung touchscreen phones .
avoid them at all costs .
the only good thing about this phone is it 's size .
well , i submitted my review of this phone .
somehow it got erased by the website .
this phone shuts off on me , puts people on speaker phone and hold on it 's own , can barely hear people when you first start talking to them .
can barely hear phone when it rings and i have my volume up to the max .
hard to text , it always wants to add characters you did not choose .
if you want to type words , then jump to type in a character or number , you have to first click on emoticons first then choose number or character , then click on emoticons again before going back to letters .
it alerts me when i have no email sometimes , and doesnt alert me when i do .
it always tells me i have missed calls when i deleted them already .
nobody can tell me why .
i 'm on my 3rd eternity already , and all the same .
most of the time it gives me errors when i try to check my email .
or errors when i try to delete email .
phone gets real hot and it 's not from being on it a long time like they say .
vibrate isnt very strong .
overall its a phone with major design flaws .
it is good the first 2 months or so , then it is falling apart .
more cons then pros , i wouldnt recommend it at all .
the only good things about it are the camera -LRB- 3 mp , which they have better now -RRB- , the widget sidebar and the tv .
not a smartphone , it is very plain .
not good for texters , or talkers .
-LRB- people can barley hear me when im on the phone with them -RRB- and not good for someone who drops there phones alot , i never dropped my phone and i always have problems , and the back slides off way too easily .
do not buy this phone , i hate it .

Got this phone instead of iphone because of cheaper data plan ; since i got this phone yesterday i am having problems everyonce in awhile dialing and receiving calls .
Phone loses connection and wont dial or receive untill i power off and on again .
Hopefully there will be a software flash for this .
Two keyboards-traditional and Qwerty give you a choice ; camera shoots excellent pics ; imaging program for pics ; variety of settings ; variety of choices to make the Eternity your own. ; To keep the face safe , it 's wise to purchase the plastic casing-another $ 35 or so ; calibration needs to be re-done several times ; needs another browser program ; dislike address book .

; you cant use all of the features if you dont have unlimited internet , the interface is not the best ... Liked the homescreen widgets and the functionality of moving across the sceen easily . .
The touch screen was ok . .
seen better. ; The lag time is slow . .
The virtual keyboard is horrible . .
The Address Book is so elementry and identifing the phone type sucks . .
The two ` Call '' and `` End ' buttons should have a display back light . .
It 's very slim and lightweight ; half of the time it does n't ring when someone calls , soon after making a call it disconnects , not very durable , screen is easily scrathed , toughscreen is terrible , memory space is low , camera quality is bad , not very loud ringer , bad speaker quality .
price , easy access to menus , widget bar , weight , overall simple to use. ; Takes a little getting use to with the touch screen for texting .
Once you get the hang of it , you can fly with ease on the keyboard .
Nice bright screen , lots of bells and whistles .
Easy to use. ; No speed dial feature .
Makes driving and talking a bummer .
Can `` t customize the desktop to get rid of icons that are unneccessary .
You can turn off some widgets , but not others .
Needs tweaking !!
I love the touchscreen and full QWERTY interface !
I have never had a phone with a touch screen , or a full QWERTY keyboard !
5 stars !
I do n't like when CNET acts like snobs though .
They Complain about the littlest things !
; The only two problems I had were : 1 .
It only comes in Black !
2 .
The contacts adder does n't have a full QWERTY keyboard !
Just a Multi-Touch Numerical one !
phone gets and sends well .
camera is excellent ; the touch screen is awful , often does n't respond , scrolling is near impossible , especially in contacts setting .
phone can not get email that is n't from a major provider , including corporate accounts The Samsung Eternity succeeds as a multimedia device ; 1 .
After accepting incoming call poor audio .
2 .
if u add 2 entries in address book like mike mcmahon cell and mike mcmahon home , it will not show full name on screen so u will get confusion like which is cell and home # to make call .
3 .
poor audio quality Intuitive OS , great reception , great speaker for MP3 , great battery life , expandable up to 8 GB micro SD , removable back for battery or memory swap , 3MP camera , full navi , all media playback thru bluetooth earpiece , accurate qwerty , html browser. ; MAYBE lack of Wi-Fi but with data plan , internet works where phone does , No outlook or enterprise support , Some flash problems , Touch Tone can be tricky but fixed with adjustments to auto lock and backlight timeout , should include data cable .
Screen - easy to see except in brightest light .
Love being able to tilt keyboard or camera and have screen adapt .
`` Back `` button is handy .
Pictures - gorgeous and true to view finder .
Emoticons easy. ; Ca n't program or put shortcuts on the screen ?
Ring tones yucky - none that rocked .
Camera zoom - not great .
People complain about `` muffled '' sound .
Widgets useless - hard to remove -LRB- maybe due to screensaver -RRB- .
Screen frozen several times .
I love all of the features the eternity has to offer , but if I had to pick something it would be the camera it 's wonderful and it has a ton of memory for storing those pics and videos !
; I 've racked my brain for something I did n't like about the eternity and honestly , I ca n't think of a thing !
i love the graphics .
i had a pantech duo and this phone is total luxury .
it goes fast and i love the texting .

Photo auto turning is nice . .
Video is nice and good sound . .
SAR rating is the best. ; Call quality is terrible .
Bad service in areas where other phones are clear and have multiple bars . .
No Message button on main screen . .
Gadgets on first screen are really useless . .
Very few ringtones . .
No real valuable apps .
all the new tech .
from att , on screen shortcuts , camera , nice looking , good battery life !
; touchy screen , has mind of it 's own sometimes -LRB- when I hit the menu button it sometimes goes sraight to messaging then automaticly to create message -RRB- , will not support many ringtones , can not change messaging tones from the ones that came with it , etc Great set up , easy for regular phone users , advance features for those that want a minor upgrade. ; No OS so you ca n't save some files .
Have to pay for some features , but internet is $ 15 compared to iPhone 's $ 30 and you can bundle w / GPS for an extra $ 5 !
Screen also auto locks after about 20 seconds , but renews back to where it ended .
Size and form-factor are great .
The phone looks awesome .
Haptic feedback and TouchWiz drag and drop are cool features .
Text messaging is probably the best I 've seen on a touch screen .
Lot 's of apps and and features. ; 1 .
Almost all the apps are monthly fees .
$ 10/month for GPS , Pandora , MobiVj , Weather , WikiMobile , XM Radio all between 3 and 8 dollars a month .
Do the math . .
2 .
Browser is VERY hit or miss . .
3 .
The TouchWiz widgets are useless and pre-determined .
sleek , easy to handle , good size , easy texting , headphone jack , pretty lights that glow all around , change to cool font , good camera , video , unlock button is in good place -LRB- unlike the impression -RRB- ; may be fragile -LRB- buying a rubber case and screen protector -RRB- no built in fm radio like my old sony ericson w80i .
Touch screen , accelerometer , fast web browsing , excellent mobile TV streaming quality , great picture and video quality -LRB- w / cool features and effects -RRB- , PDF viewing , widget sidebar , very good battery life ; Does n't have a wide selection of apps like iPhone , but its not really a con because the apps it does have are awesome It looks nice and takes nice pictures ; No speed dial , no shortcuts , phone does n't unlock when a text message is received , no option to change the length of time for the phone to lock , lack of a `` normal '' vibration option It has a great touch screen and the touch qwerty keypad on it is easy to use it moves along pretty fasy. ; It did n't really want to work with my memory card .
Sound quality is great .
I liked the way it fit in your hand .
It had a great camera .
Nice picture to it but nothing to special .
Cool light at the bottom !
; Scratches easy and thats all i can complain about .
Well lacks flash too .
Packed with features , I would love to be able to use this phone. ; Dragging you finger across the screen to scroll to a particular contact or feature is impossible .
An intermediate item would activate 9 out of 10 times .
And that was sitting in the kitchen using both hands .
It does n't have a speed dail. ; `` It does n't have a speed dail .
the meuns are way out of order .
it is very hard to get the hang of answering the phone .
The key pad is locked will drive you crazy .
Please let samsung know that this kind of phone will not cut it . ''
I like the touch screen and quality of the camera. ; The phone shuts off every few days .
I will be in the middle of transfering music and it will shut off without warning then i have to start all over .
I love to text and had tried out the LG Shine and hated it for texting .
I returned it and got the Eternity .
Call quality has been great -LRB- LG shine kept dropping calls -RRB- .
Love the TV feature .
Good lightweight phone that takes descent pictures. ; Email capabilities may not be the best , but I was not really looking for a phone that had that .
The call quality was very strong .
When adjusted properly , the speaker phone , ringer and overall audio volume was good .
Excellent display and feels good in your hand .
Compared to some of the competition you can include expanded contact information. ; Lack of Wi-Fi and No Voice Dialing is a drawback ... 1 .
Slim and sleek . .
2 .
Touch screen is very responsive . .
3 .
Key Board experience is awsome . .
4 .

The browser is very bad .2 .
No gtalk in-built.2 .
Not able to have attachments in emails .3 .
Ca n't do a search in contacts .4 .
Event list app is not working .5 .
Lot of uncustomizable things -LRB- like the background for the Main menu -RRB- 5 .
No wifi it has a really clean and quck interface , very quick and smooth .
The phone surprisingly had a very nice touch screen , not as good as the iphone but as close as any other phone has gotten .
the widgets are also a nice touch ; Very low volume on earpeice during calls -LRB- Very frustrating -RRB- , ringtones are a real pain with this phone too , it has VERY limited capabilitties when using ringtones and very strict limits -LRB- 300kb or less -RRB- .
I like the virtual keyboard and the size of the screen. ; Screen scratches easy .
Every time there is a time change -LRB- daylight savings -RRB- all of my appointments in the calendar are messed up .
Touch screen does n't respond well - have to use fingernails .
Excellent user interface .

Highly recommend this phone for reception , messaging , and multimedia !!!
; There is nothing that I can find that doesnt suit me .
This is my first multimedia type of phone and I am surprised how I really didnt care that it didnt have WIFI .
Accurate and responsive touch keypad .
Big screen for the web , and shows web pages correctly. ; The widget bar is full of useless apps , and you can not add your own .
Same for the main menu .
No ability to add your preferred apps to the widget bar or the main menu makes these ` features ' more of a hassle .
Texting is great , internet is better than expected .
Memory is also pretty good .
Battery last one day of pretty heavy use , not bad I guess. ; No wi-fi , no voice dialing , that is pretty sad .
Antenna strength is not the greatest , and I can not hear calls very well , if you get this phone get a good ear piece .
like this phone for the long battery life , neat and easy to use software , touch screen keyboard for texting and good applications. ; internet but i did not buy it for a business phone Stylish phone , love the colors at the bottom , very durable , easy to use - basic. ; The phone freezes and glitches .
It turns itself off and back on without pushing a button !
It is very frustrating to try and talk on it and realize the call is dropped or the phone has rebooted itself !
It freezes if you type too fast while texting I love the touch screen and texting is so easy . .
Great video and TV shows are totally coolfeature to have ... .
Good call quality and sending videos and just pictures is fast and simple . .
; I think that the camera needs a flash . .
Battery life is not real great . .
need to charge if I use the apps every day The camera 's pretty good and the phone is a good size. ; I use my phone everyday for texting and I hate it .
It is really hard to text quickly and a lot .
I have had the phone for almost a year and I still have n't gotten the hang of texting quickly on it .
Smoothness of operating system , ease of navigation , sound profiles , both a qwerty keypad and a dialing pad to use in texting and dialing .
Media Net is fast , integrated music player and traditional headphone jack. ; No way to customize screensaver -LRB- you can customize wallpaper -RRB- , no customization of items on the menu .
No speed dial .
Many monthly costs for app service .
Great looking display .
Responsive touch-screen .
Decent camera .
Better music player quality than my previous Sony Walkman phone .
Intuitive menus -LRB- for the most part -RRB- .
E-mail support .
Nice contacts system .
Sleek looking styling. ; Very few cons .
Lack of speed or voice dial seems to be an issue for some - not an issue for me .
The call quality is not the best - can be a little hard to hear -LRB- no interference , more of a drop in the sound itself between words -RRB- .
Lack of USB cable .
easy to use , lots of extras , great storage for numbers and texting .
Excellent camnera and video capabilites. ; Games that have been downloaded freeze on a regular basis , and freeze the phone .
The battery does not last long , however with everything the phone does I can see why .
I bought the phone because it is rated as having very low electromagnetic emission ; Poor quality - after 9 months of very moderate use , touch screen started to give errors : press one digit or letter and the on-screen keyboard highlights a different number or letter , sometimes not even next to the one I pressed .
touch screen is pretty , bright , and easy to understand .
some cool extra features and apps .
very light -LRB- almost feels like a plastic toy instead an expensive piece of technology -RRB- .
pretty small altogether ; touch screen is very finicky .
call volume is VERY low .
font is way too big .
text messaging is more effort than it should be .
just not a full-out business phone at all .
internet browser is pretty complicated , almost not worth using The design is amazing .
The keyboard phenomonal .
I absolutely love the bluetooth capabalities and ease of using it .
The phone is mostly a great investment. ; The sound is terrible in anything less then great service .
The volume on the phone at it 's max is hard to hear so I miss calls all the time .
The keyboard is a little touchie &#38; takes a minute to go from one keyboard to the other .
I like almost everything on this phone , especially the texting .
It is so much easier and I never make mistakes .
I love the touch screen and the easy access to get to everything. ; The only things that are missing is the wi-fi and the flash on the camera ... Other than that , the phone is great and would recommend it to anyone considering buying it .
I would take this phone over the iPhone anyday ... :-RRB- I dig it .
Smooth , easy to use .
Looks classy .
If you want a cool phone but do n't want to run with the iphone dorks , this is for you. ; I am a mac dork .
I want a phone that wants to make friends with my mac .
They 're not to friendly .
The disk that comes with it only runs in windows , useless .
The handbook that comes with it , useless .
Comes with very limited ring tones .
TV does n't work haptic feedback , great camera , lots of camera options , very personalizable , touchwiz ui , good keyboard , huge screen , greaty quality screen , quality video recording , texting is fast and easy , bluetooth , i could go on and on. ; screensaver is n't customizable -LRB- but wallpaper is -RRB- , can be hard to find a contact in a huge list , hard to use t9 on full keyboard layout , ca n't set your own music as a ringtone , only four choices for a msg alert tone -LRB- no way to add more to choose from -RRB- Very good OS , many functions , very good antenna signal , great sound quality , full qwerty keyboard , good quality camera , great Wi-Fi , great battery , good TV quality , nice Bluetooth signal range , has the mini stereo jack for a headset ; Not a lot of zoom for the camera , no camera is not covered so its very easy to scratch the glass , no flash , no FM radio , memory expandable to 8 GB only , little options in the image editing , does n't come with a USB cable Easy learning curve , works logically , I no longer take the newspaper into the bathroom , read old magazines in Dr. Office etc. .
Internet is fast , Videos are amazing .
Bought an 8 gig card and have 4 movies and more music than I can listen to on it. ; Difficult to switch to a numbered keypad in time for automated responses : .
`` For English press 1 '' etc. .
Anyone who complains about the battery life either has a defetive battery or NO LIFE .
No Speed Dial or voice dialing .
I like the ease of use of the texting feature .
Easy to maneuver through the icons .
Voice quality is good. ; Have problems with battery losing power , even with very little use .
Worked fine for two weeks then phone did not hold charge .
Had to recharge 3 tiimes in 24 hours and no use.Store exchanged phone for new one .
Noticing possible problem again .
Touch screen , very fast , responsive to touch .
Phone does just about everything you could ask for and more. ; No capability for AT &#38; T Mobile Backup as of yet so if you have alot of contacts in your address book and the SIM only will keep 250 its rather labor intensive to put them all in .
I am sure the Mobile Backup will support this phone at some time .
Touch screen , screen size , display/colors , plays music &#38; through Bluetooth earpiece .
Music pauses when receiving a call , the earphone jack , the orientation detector that allows typing and viewing in landscape .
Assign default phone number for contact. ; This phone lacks several standard features you would fine on most phones .
I did n't realize I missed them until I could n't use them on this phone .
IMO , Samsung programmers left out little things to make the phone easier to use .
Like all the available features , TV , GPS etc. .
Great touch screen , and very easy to use . .
Looks good , great reception and nice size -LRB- not too big not too small -RRB- ; No WIFI , NO VOICE DIALING ! .
Also no icon for contacts cell number , they have home , work , FAX -LRB- why ? -RRB-
and ETC. .
Which I never heard of before on a phone .
I love this phone because it is so much like the iphone but its not !
It does pretty much everything just like the iphone .
The keyboard rotates and its touch screen and is an awesome phone. ; What I dont like is that when you type something the screen isnt as sensitive as I would hope it to be .
You really have to tap the key that you want where as compared to the iphone its really sensitive and u barely have to touch the screen .
Live TV , flashing light strip on outside of the phone , very small , awesome camera features , long qwerty keyboard , handwriting detection , nice contact display , great display picture .
really really fast internet !
; My TV icon doesnt work , I have to get to it by going into my apps which is really weird , no TBS or MTV on the live TV , def need to charge it every night even though I 've been playing with it ALOT , not a smartphone , u need to pay for EVERYthing on it .
Great basic features .
The touchscreen is wonderfully responsive .
Great texting phone .
Easy to use to surf the net , etc Top notch music player .
Overall great phone for those not wanting to pay for a full-featured smart phone. ; The digital keyboard took just a bit to get used to , but once I did , it is great .
I do wish it was possible to download more apps and widgets .
It could be more customizable .
Voice dialing would be nice .
Everything about the phone from the camera to the widgets and especially the text and acceloromater !
; The only flaw that I have seen in this phone is that you can not change the screensaver but that is not even a big deal because you only see it for 4 seconds total time when unlocking and locking the phone .
Great , responsive touch screen -LRB- not capacitive like iPhone -RRB- , the haptic feedback enhances texting experience , great sounding music player -LRB- yes , I have the iPod touch and this sounds better -RRB- .
Works great with Opera Mini 4.2 , thus easy browsing. ; Ringtones are a bummer in that you ca n't just ` choose a song and go ' , you have to edit the song to a 300k sized mp3 or other supported format for it to work .
If you set the screen 's brightness to maximum , it sucks up the battery 's life big time .
I love how it has an easy to use touch screen keyboard .
The music speakers are loud too , and the messages send VERY fast. ; I have A LOT of music so when I have to search for them it takes me a long time .
It does n't have a search bar so I have to scroll for a LONG time .
And I would really love it if it had WIFI .
Lots of handy apps , feedback feeling when you touch the screen .
Not too sensitive .
Easy to use .
I can access anything on the internet with my $ 10 unlimited media package because it is not a `` smartphone '' .
You can change light-up color. ; Ca n't change the picture that shows up when the phone is locked .
I would like to be able to put shortcuts in the widget bar .
-LRB- i.e. mlb.mobile , FB -RRB- Touchscreen , battery life , full qwerty keyboard , good options for setting up display and ringer , camera , speaker phone , bluetooth , tv ; No speed dialing , Call and End buttons do not light up , limited ring tones , not getting great clarity with my bluetooth headset , while in a call I wish the screen would default to the touch pad screen , no flash Web browsing is awesome because you can use the volume buttons to zoom in and out quickly . .
I text pretty fast and this phone keeps up . .
scrolling with the fingernail is very sensitive and responsive .
multi tasking between web and messaging !
; I really didnt like the camera or the music interface . .
the camera is 3 megapixel which basically just means that its big but blurry . .
the music is sluggish between songs and it also does let you search for artists , songs , or albums .
I love that the touch screen is easy to use and texting is great .
This phone has a lot of freedom compared to the other phones i had in the past .
It 's also very fast at most thing and everything is amazing !
; No Wifi .
That 's it .
I really like all the features that it packs .
like mobile TV -LRB- you need a TV plan with it -RRB- and GPS .
It has many more .
It also has a Micro SD card slot which is nice. ; The phone touch screen is going bad after less than a year of use .
using the phone has become difficult .
Also , I think that the phone thinks it has headphones plugged in because music and sound files wont play outloud but it will ring and alarm works Camera is awesome , great quality ! .
Customized color for light that comes on when you get a text or call . .
Screen turns with you when you turn the phone . .
During phone call , when you take the phone away from your ear the screen lights up on it 's own. ; Texting on touch screen takes time to get use to . .
Call , clear , and end call buttons at bottom of phone do n't light up .
The quality of the phone calls are good .
I like the texting capabilities and it was very easy to sync to a bluetooth device .
Overall it is very easy to use and quality is good .
The email functionality was very easy to set up and use. ; G3 connections are slow and hit and miss .
No WiFi support or infrared sync capabilities .
The GPS app works very good , , I was impressed however the volume could not be set high enough on the phone to really hear what was going on .
No camera flash .
I 'm in total agreement with others that this is the best phone I 've ever used .
The UI and touch screen are excellent .
Useful apps .
Brilliant screen resolution !
Thankfully not an iphone !
Touch screen calibration/vibrating feedback .
SO MUCH MORE !
; AT &#38; T demands too much money for silly media applications -LRB- not a fault of the phone ! -RRB- .
Ca n't delete unusable/undesirable icons from menu .
Ca n't customize widgets , although it 's still easy to access your favorite apps .
The phone has wonderful graphics and good volume .
I love the touch screen and keyboard .
Plus , the music player is wonderful .
The widgets have to be one of my favorite aspects of the phone .
Plus there is plenty of room for pictures and ringtones , etc. ; I am neurotic , and the fingerprints really bother me .
I also do n't like how you ca n't change the screen saver .
The battery life is n't spectacular especially if you use the music player as often as I do .
I have to charge it every night .
The touch screen buttons for dialing make this phone very easy to use when dialing numbers , especially for someone like me who has large fingers and has trouble with the micro keyboards on most phones these days .
Very good connectivity inside cities ; If the phone is used a lot the touch screen ceases functioning -LRB- More than 10 calls per day -RRB- .
Outside of major cities -LRB- 20-30 miles -RRB- cell service is very weak .
Phone will occasionally shut down at random .
In 5 months phone deleted all contacts twice This phone has a very colorful screen .
The touch screen is very responsive coming very close to the iphones screen .
The widgets are also very unique .
The battery life is decent , i can get about 3 days of moderate use before i have to charge it again. ; Some minor thing are that you can not add any more widgets for now , hopefully they will add that in a firmware upgrade .
Also there is no media net or message shortcut for the widget bar but they can be reached with 1-2 clicks .
