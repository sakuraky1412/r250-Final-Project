I use the water for my coffee, tea, home made soda [Sodastream], and drinking water.
It supplies great tasting water and removes many toxins, according to the literature that accompanies them.
It removes contaminants and lead according to the literature, and it does improve the taste.
These water filters are designed for my Samsung refrigerator, and operate leak free.
No leaks and the water tastes great.
This is the OEM filter.
I also make a habit of replacing these whenever the "replace light" comes on.
Fit perfectly in my fridge.
Very satisfied with the taste.
Fits my Samsung fridge.
This OEM filter works perfectly as expected.
Easy to replace.
