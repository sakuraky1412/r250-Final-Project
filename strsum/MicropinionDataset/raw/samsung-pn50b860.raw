Pros:. Easy setup, great picture, updates are easy to download.. 
Cons:. It's a personal heating device. it puts out a lot of heat while operating.. 
Summary:. This TV is very easy to set up and has a huge number of settings you can work from to get the perfect picture. The TV has a nice heavy base to anchor it on your tv stand. The widgets are nice to use and turn off very easily if you don't want to use them all the time. The picture, once you have it set up, is stunning. It's 1080p performance with blu-ray discs and hd tv is terrific.. I've seen a lot of reviews on here where they've encountered buzzing with the tv. Mine has not had any of this since I've had it. I use my receiver for the most part for my sound, but I do have a few things that I run through my tv and there has not been any problem with buzzing at all. My only problem that I've had with the set is that the video board on it died and had to be replaced. This happened after about 9 months, I've had the same problem with both of my plasma tv's, so it seems to be a problem with plasma tv's in general. Samsung's customer service was terrific and quickly arranged for a tech to come out and replace the boards in the set(all were replaced) at no charge to me. I've downloaded several updates to the firmware and they were very easy to install using a wi-fi connection.. I get a lot of comments arout how thin the set is and that is one of the reasons that I bought it. The picture, though, was the main reason I bought it. I saw it in a local store and it just said "Buy me" as I walked by the display. Very shortly after that I did.. I would highly recommend this set to anyone looking for a plasma..

Pros:. very deep blacks. super thin!. Tons of color and video controls. true colors right out of the box. on and on.... 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. Forget what you read about the BUZZING. Before buying I read every review there was. I figured about 15% of the buyers were getting the buzzers. I was actually going to get the 650 to save money, get there ever so slightly deeper black and not get the ultra coolness factor of a 1.2" TV. I couldn't actually get the 650 locally and I just don't like to buy this kind of stuff online in case anything goes wrong. I made a calculated risk and went for the 860 and man is this thing impressive. Solid. NO BUZZING or any weaknesses what-so-ever. Buy this TV before it is gone. Check out Cnet's review. They rate it the very highest - best of all TV 50"-53". Noooo Buzzzzz!!!. The other complaint is the sound. I'd say it is adequate, but who really buys a TV like this and doesn't add separate speakers?! You can use the TVs speakers as a perfect faux center channel fill....

Pros:. Picture quality, menu gui interfaces, thin, appearance. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. I purchased this tv in the 50" version, PN50B860, and I've only had it a few days but wanted to write a review after all the research I did before making my purchase.. I was sold on the very thin form factor from the start, so I was looking at the Samsung LEDs initially before I found these plasmas. I wanted 1080p, thin, great picture, etc...I didnt want the edge-lit LED, so that was limiting me to waiting for the Samsung 8500 back lit series to come out. When those came out I waited for the CNET review as well as some customer feedback. As I expected, the tv performed great. I wasnt too shy about the 4k price tag, but not enthused about it either; I do like a deal if I can find it :) It was around this time I found the 850/860 series plasma that's also the very thin form factor. The price was $2200 when I first saw it, and I thought this was much more reasonable than the 8500 series, so I started doing research on the 850/860 series. The CNET and other reviews I found looked favorable, with great picture quality, and in fact one of their few gripes was that it was a bit expensive due to the thin form factor! At basically half the price of the 8500 series LED it seemed like a bargain :) I was most certainly leery about the reviews noting a buzzing issue with the tvs, but after much more research on a variety of sites and message forums, it looked like that yes, the buzzing was real, but that it was a minority of sets that had the problem, maybe 1 in 10. So I decided it was worth the risk and decided to go with the 860 series in lieu of the 8500 LED. With the holidays approaching I of course waited for a sale, and ended up getting my PN50B860 for $1579.. I took delivery a few days ago, and have been impressed since firing it up the first time. I put it on the wall on a multi-angle articulated mount for viewing from just about anywhere. I immediately set the picture settings to what CNET determined was optimal in the review, and played around a bit with it for myself to adjust to my viewing conditions. I was instantly impressed by how much clearer and brighter just my normal cable HD channels were. Football looks great :) I then proceeded to go through everything else, SD tv, DVD, Blu-Ray, and video games. SD tv is fine of course, nothing spectacular compared to anything HD. DVD was fantastic, just a tiny bit grainy up close, but that could also be a side effect of my receiver upconverting to 1080i. I need to play with the settings and let it come through in the native format and see if there's a difference. Blu-Ray is absolutely glorious; seamless, brilliant, crystal-clear, and a whole bunch of other adjectives. All games I've tried on PS3 and Wii have been far crisper and much clearer than the old tv.. I have no buzzing issue at all. I will wait and see but I dont hear anything at all, even up close.. To be fair, I was coming from an almost 5 year old Panasonic projection LCD tv, PT-50LC14, 1080i.. I cant comment on others that have said the speakers arent very good, I have never turned them up and never will. Sound and everything runs through the home theater. If you're buying this tv you really shouldnt be using the tv speakers anyway, c'mon.... The bottom line is that I'm very happy with this TV and my decision to purchase it, and that's all you can really ask for :). All my test components (except the wii, which is component video) are wired with HDMI to my receiver, which is then wired with HDMI to the tv. Receiver is a Yamaha RX-V2700.. 

$$;
Pros:. Color accuracy with deep black levels.. 
Cons:. Took me a while to figure out DNLA and tech support was non-existent. However, once figured out, works great.. 
Summary:. At a current price well below it's stiffest competitor (Panasonic V10), this purchase was a no-brainer. Seeing the 2 side-by-side, the 860 blew the V10 away, much more true-to-life colors in my opinion. And this is far and away the coolest looking set on the planet but that is just a bonus because picture quality is the real star. As for a buzz, haven't heard it except for what is standard on plasma sets if you stand right next to it with the volume way down. Great set.. 

$$;
Pros:. Style how thin it is. NO Glare that was one of my biggest issues due to a very bright living room. The Color is crazy good. if you are debating like me you must buy it.. 
Cons:. Due to it being a plasma I am kind of taking extra precautions of breaking the tv in, but I know it will be well worth the wait. dont rush it. 
Summary:. When i was looking for a perfect tv a few months ago I looked at all makes of tv. when I starting looking at cnet for guidance knew I wanted a Plasma. BUT the lcd and led look great also. I kind of looked past the lcd knowing I wanted something richer in color and deeper blacks. Not to kick lcd to the curb there are some sweet looking ones out there but none that caught my eye. The Samsung LEDs looked cool especially how thin they were. BUT there off viewing angle sucks. My buddy has a LED and if you are looking dead on it looks good but that is where his chair is. All the other seats in the living room are off center and the picture looks washed out. I want a tv that every seat in my living room has the best seat in the house. Also this is fist generation of the super thin led tvs, you never want to buy a fist generation there are always bugs that they dont find until second generation. I wanted something that has a good solid track record with great looking pictures. PLASMA.. There are alot of bashers out there saying they run too hot, drink to much energy, and bun every image into the screen. Come on that was 10 years ago they have come a long way. And if you are worried about the Plasma taking in to much energy well then ride a bike to work. lol. I have been debating on the Samsung 860 vs the Panasonic v10 for months now. I have read almost every review possible on almost every website. I have talked to guys at American tv and Best Buy. Have gone countless # of times to both retailers to view the tvs. I feel its my duty to write a good review for all the other guys like me who want the best of the best tv out there. This is a big purchase.. I will break down some issues I wanted to clear up when I was looking at both tvs.. Glare, its hard to look at the tvs at retail stores to get a good sense of how the tv will look in your house. a good way to judge glair is to get close to the tv, turn the set off ,get out your cell phone or if you have a small light (key chain light) and shine it at the screen. I did that to both the v10 and 860. For this review I was only able to get my hands on the 58in tv. The v10 has a single pain of glass witch looks clean, I took out the light and bam I saw a double reflection of the light. the reflection was soo bright that I could see the # on my key pad on the cell phone. On the 860 I could kind of see a reflection on the screen but it was very dull and diluted. point to the 860. style its up to you, you are the one looking at it but you can only be amazed at how thin the 860 is.. Picture quality, its a draw both looked really really good. I felt that the samsung looked richer in color but that was my opinion. both have cinema smooth, but the v10 has THX which is just cool to have. I will say that the v10 does have deeper blacks but that is not saying that the 860 is weak in that department. the 860 look great also.. Not to many people talk about this on there review but I did listen to both sets with the volume on, not external speakers but the speakers built into the set. I liked the v10 a little deeper but the 860 was a little louder. both sets are very easy to max out due to how little power they push. Its also hard to get a true sense when you are in a huge store. But I do have the 860 at home and the speakers are not bad I can watch tv at a reasonable volume and not feel short changed.. Finally the buzz noise, lol a few day before I got it delivered I was freaking out it I was going to get the buzzing tv but when I received it, I hooked it up and I was so engulfed into the tv I didn't hear a buzz but when I said to myself do i hear a buzz, I did. Honestly its not a problem its soooo minimal. is there a buzzz yes, is it louder that the speakers on the tv on normal to low viewing NO. during break in the tv I have the tv running and the volume all the way down. When I walk past the living room I kind of hear it, the buzz gets louder and softer during different scenes on the set. but overall nothing to worry about it. also if you dont like the buzz then return it, well that is if you got it at a local retail store like I did.. last big talk was heat coming off the tv. at the retail store they are in full out burn mode to suck you in to but the tv. the sets there were warm, not hot. I have run My 860 for well over 12 hours straight on normal settings and it barley gets warm. I dont know about the v10 I can only imagine its the same.. Overall I am very please with the 860 its a great tv, its thin, no buzz, and very low glare which I am happy with, and the PICTURE IS AWESOME. Both the v10 and 860 are great but the big selling point for me was how thin the set was. I am going to be putting the tv on the wall in kind of a heavy traffic area so I needed something close to the wall.. Good luck with your search for the perfect tv for you. Dont always listen to what the guys say at the store they want to make the sale do your own homework..

Pros:. Great picture, lots of adjustments, great feature set. No buzzing sound, no problems. Terrific picture during daytime viewing with lots of sunlight in the room.. 
Cons:. The sound quality from the speakers doesn't match the greatness of the picture. The remote doesn't control my Sony home theater system.. 
Summary:. From the research I did, and the in-store comparisons, I think this TV provides a terrific combination of quality, performance and feature set vs price. The picture quality is stunning, the design/thiness of the TV makes my friends drool with envy. Viewing sports and fast action scenes produces no distortion - as I used to see on my 52" Sony DLP..

Pros:. Get picture - deep blacks - thin look is nice - lots of features. 
Cons:. Speaker in TV are so so - connected to our sony media system takes care of this issue.. 
Summary:. Great set - was looking at the LED model - for the $$$ cannot bet the picture of this plasma. I do not have the buzzing problem. I did make sure that I routed all cables per the installation manual. Samsung seems very specific about proper cable install.. Light weight made for an easy wall install..

Pros:. It's really good for me with Ultra Slim Touch of Color Design, Crystal full HD etc. I think this is quite perfect for me in this cost. Look http://astore.amazon.com/samsung.pn50b650.cheapest.price-20/detail/B0024NL4E2 and you will love it same me.. 
Cons:. It quite big and many weighted but in my addition it's ok.. 
Summary:. I like this HDTV.. Updated. on Mar 15, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Picture Quality. 2. Complete control of picture attributes.. 3. Thickness, or should I say thinness? It's a bit more than 1" for a 50" TV.. 4. 24p mode with 96Hz refresh rate. 5. Internet connectivity with support for YouTube, Netflix, Yahoo etc. 
Cons:. 1. There is a slight buzz that one can hear when the screen is bright (or mostly white) in a very quiet environment with the TV itself not producing any sound.. 2. A bug, probably in firmware, that reduces the contrast when 24p mode is engaged.. 
Summary:. Picture quality is a combination of several parameters and for me the major ones are: brightness / contrast / color reproduction and handling of motion. Plasmas always trump LCDs (and even most LEDs) in contrast; and motion blur is still an issue for many high-end 240Hz LEDs. Coming from an LCD I can say the motion blur is almost non-existent in this plasma and the contrast is way better. This black now looks more like black than dark gray on my LCD.. The LCDs and LEDs trump plasmas in brightness normally. But this TV is quite viewable in a bright living room. As long as there is no direct sunlight on the TV screen itself, you can watch it comfortably in Dynamic mode. Sure the dynamic mode doesn't display the best picture quality this TV is capable of, but in such a bright ambient, you are hardly capable judging the picture quality. This TV has 2 expert modes for storing calibrated attributes for day time and night time viewing. Once you set them up for your family/living/media room, you don?t have to change modes due to the ambience regularly.. The color reproduction is excellent on this TV compared to a standard LCD and I believe this is due to the fact that plasmas are capable of producing deeper black level. The color just pops out and if taken the time to adjust the TV using a DVD setup guide like AVIA, the picture quality will rival the more expensive TV sets with professional calibration. If you can get this TV calibrated by an experienced professional (not Best Buy Geek squad), it can (almost) rival a calibrated Pioneer Kuro.. To me the picture quality is the most important feature and apart from that, the other major factors that decided in favor of this model are the 24p support with 96Hz refresh rate, my wife?s strong liking for its super-thin ~1 inch frame and internet/media capability (not major since I use HTPC).. 24p support was very important for me because most DVDs and Blu-Ray movies are recorded with 24 frames per second (fps). Panasonic G15 plasma also has this 24p support but it plays at 48Hz refresh rate that causes flickers if one is (I am) sensitive to that. 96Hz refresh rate is as good as a pro CRT and eliminates that issue.. I don?t have the need as drive the TV with my HTPC (Windows 7 media center and Boxee) but the internet capability is quite good and quite usable if you connect the TV to your router through Ethernet port. It?s a little slow to start but has quite good support for YouTube, Netflix, Blockbuster, Yahoo weather, Yahoo news, stock and many more. The Yahoo widgets like weather, news, stocks etc can be displayed as an overlay without blocking the TV channel you are watching and is a nice touch. If these widgets satisfy your internet need on TV, you can totally skip the HTPC.. The built-in media player is also quite capable and can play almost any media files (mp3, mp4, mkv, avi, mpg, divx etc) from a USB drive as well as shared computer drive using DLNA protocol. The TV also has built-in memory where you can download contents like recipe, cartoons, pictures etc from Samsung site as well as create your own.. Like everything, there are few issues with this TV as well but they are not significant in my opinion and probably a firmware will fix the low black level in 24p mode quickly. There is a work-around though ? in 24p, change the mode to dynamic and then back to cal-day or cal-night.. The buzzing issue probably has no cure. Some owners said a Samsung technician can install a few rubber cubes to dampen the vibration if I want; but for me it?s not really a problem as I don?t watch TV on mute and also my living room is not that quiet.. The biggest issue for me is the feature called ?dynamic brightness? which this TV uses to improve the contrast ratio. While this might be a very welcome feature for many, and I don?t really notice it always; I still don?t like a feature that I can?t turn off. Also, I drive the TV with a high-end graphics card and can control color/brightness etc from there if there is a need. Other dynamic or auto features can be turned off so I don?t have an issue.. The feature-list is so exhaustive that it is unlikely that an average person will even be able to use all the bells and whistles this model offers. Apart from the trivial issues, it has truly satisfied the geek in me and I believe until larger OLED TVs are available &#38; affordable (at least 5 years from now), I don?t have to upgrade.. Sorry about the long review, I actually skipped a lot to keep it short :^). Updated. on Mar 4, 2010.

Pros:. Great picture, deep blacks, vivid colors, easy setup, stylishly thin, relatively inexpenisve. 
Cons:. Poor audio performance (not an issue with a HTS), runs warm. 
Summary:. In direct showroom floor comparisons to the Panasonic TC-PV10 series the Samsung won hands down. I must admit the news that the PV10's were losing their black levels after a certain number of hours was not comforting. I did see evidence of this on the showroom. I did a direct comparison of the Samsung PN58B860 vs. Panasonic TC-P58V10 where the salesman told me the PV10 had "almost certainly" been out on the floor for at least 1000hrs and the black levels were poor compared to the 860. I visited another showroom where the PV10 was claimed to be newer than 500hrs and although the black levels were better, they still did not match up to the Samsung IMHO. The colors seemed to be more realistic and vivid at the same time on the 860. The price difference in the 58" models was the clincher for me. The PV10 was $800 more in most places, which just could not be justified, especially with the risk of it losing black levels after 1000hrs or so. When I picked up the PN58B860 I ran into the local Samsung rep and asked about the buzzing issue. He told me it was a known issue, since resolved on the production line, and would be taken care of by calling 1800samsung if I had the issue. It is a mechanical issue with the power supply than can be easily fixed by installing a washer. This is understandable given the small amount of real estate in a 1.5" thin unit. I have not had an issue with buzzing although it does tend to run warm. Overall I am very pleased with the Samsung and would highly recommend it to family &#38; friends.. 

$$;
Pros:. picture quality in SD &#38; HD outstanding, slim and looks great, menus, 4 hdmi. 
Cons:. some buzzing, not many rca inputs. 
Summary:. I originally bought this TV as a store demo and do not recommend doing this. Stores set their demos on "store mode" which immediately puts out the brightest, most vibrant picture that can burn the phosphors prematurely which can cause burn-in. Also, the store model buzzed...loudly (will explain below). So I returned it for a Samsung LCD LN52B610 and a Panasonic Plasma TCP50S1 - both of these TV's could not even come CLOSE to the picture quality of the 850. So I went and got a brand new 850 for the same price as the original store demo I bought, by chance it happened to be on sale.. The picture quality and looks on the 850 are second to none at this price point. SD and HD content are unbelievable, no pixelization on SD like on an LCD. Hockey/Sports is flawless, BluRay even better. I do not understand how stores push the LCD/LED over Plasma. They may run cheaper and cooler, but IMO plasma (this one anyway) has unmatched PQ.. The menus are easy to use and seem to have endless picture options, 4 hdmi mount sideways to keep the ultra-thin profile. Not many rca inputs, my Wii takes up all 5 but with a TV this thin you have to sacrifice something =) Speakers are weak but I have it hooked up to a Bose Cinemate for my main floor setup. You will need an external speaker system and I would recommend a Harmony remote for one-button on/off. Glare is not too bad in a bright room, but I'm sure LCD is a bit better on this front. I'm not home during the day to watch TV anyway so it's not a concern for me.. I have noticed some buzz but it is not as bad as the original store demo I had. Work your plasma in properly, run it at 50% contrast / brightness, lower the colour and put the picture mode to standard or eco (not dynamic), put the picture size at screen fit (so there are no bars on the side on SD channels). Set your pixel shift at 4 horiz / 2 vert every 1-2 mins. This will work the phosphors in properly and not burn them out prematurely. This will also reduce the buzzing substantially, and you may get used to the picture this way, I already have and I still think it looks amazing. Glad I bought a new set so I could work it in on my own. I highly recommend this TV if you can deal with some buzz that plasmas inherently have, you will not be disappointed with the picture quality, that I can GUARANTEE!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Stunning design, beautiful picture, solid stand, nice wire management clips included. Many tweaking options for getting the picture exactly the way you want it. Internet connectivity. Anti-burn in features gives some comfort.. 
Cons:. Premium price for the form-factor, however a good alternative to the LED-backlit models, which haven't rated that well. I do hear a slight buzzing only if I put my ear up to it. I have burn-in anxiety. Sound is a little weak.. 
Summary:. I just received this and was blown away by it's good looks and picture quality. I was amused and at the same time, relieved by the weight of the stand, which is good for this thin, large TV. It is also sharp-looking, being brushed metal.. The picture quality is wonderful, but I do have burn-in anxiety coming from a Sony SXRD 50" WEGA projection HDTV, where I didn't have to worry about it. I'm sure I'll get over it, as I don't run static images or do a lot of gaming where this may otherwise be a problem. We'll see how the anti-burn in protection performs.. As far as the sound goes, if you're going to spend this kind of money for a TV, you really need to budget some money for a home theatre system to compliment the picture. There is just no way to get good sound from a TV that's an inch-thin. It's just not possible (yet). The sound is good enough for general use, but if you're going to watch a Blu-Ray action movie, you need to match the sound to the picture. I'm getting the Polk SurroundBar, which is reported to sound great with very little clutter.. I'll update my review later when I've had more quality-time with my TV, but so far I am very happy with my purchase!.

Pros:. Read below. 
Cons:. Read below. 
Summary:. Pros:This television is one of the best plasmas I've seen on the market. With its super slim design it makes for a incredibly space saving tv. Its loaded with tons of feature ranging from it's intenet tv options to its home networking functions. It has superb anti burn in features which seem to get rid of what ever image retention you encounter .This tv also offer tons a ways to adjust the picture to your liking as well as 3 settings for power consumption so that you can control the picture and the energy used to power it.. Cons:Speaker that come in the tv don't really immerse you in the experience but do complement well if combined with other speaker systems . Tv doesn suffer from some minor image retention if contrast is high but as long as contrast is maintained to a reasonable level most image retention can be handled by the anti burn in features such as pixel shift and scrolling .There is a slight buzzing sound when volume is low and picture contrast is high but nothing to deter you from the full experience of this tv . This tv i must say does have pretty poor standard definition display at least with cable but as for high def it will go unmatched!. overall: over all i believe this is a great chocie of plama over the competing models and technologies (Lcd,"LED" and, OLED) with its many extensive features that other hi-def televisions may lack the samsung pn50b860 is one of the best plasmas and hi-def tv's on the market .. 

$$;
Pros:. picture quality, internet access, content, thinness, remote, pretty, perfect size. 
Cons:. buzz is audible 7-12 feet away. Get a 5.1 system and you won't hear it :) That's my only complaint.. 
Summary:. I narrowed down my TV decision to either Sony or Samsung. I went with this. Samsung plasma for the colors and aesthetics. The blacks are pure and colors. are vibrant. The TV is beautiful compared to a lot of the lower end models.. Installation was easy, it was a little disconcerting trying not to break the TV,. but with help and the foam inserts in the box. It is totally doable with 2. people. If you are uneasy, get the $99 in-home delivery.. I knocked the star scale to a 4 simply because of the buzzing sound that others. have complained about. Sitting in the chair 7 feet away I can totally hear the. annoying buzz. From the normal sitting areas they are 12 - 15 feet away, the. buzz is hardly noticeable if the AV receiver is on. If the volume is low, it can. be still heard.. The first week, I was watching a basketball game on ESPN, and noticed a little. image retention where the ESPN logo appeared. This scared me and I immediately. thought it was burn in. But watching other shows and using the scrolling. feature, it completely went away. Nothing to worry about.. I use the TV for watching HD cable, PS3 gaming, 4:3 TV, DVD letterbox and. blu-ray viewing. You will get a little image retention if you have bright white. logos or black bars for 2+ hours. It will go away.. Crutchfield shopping experience is TREMENDOUS, they are the best totally worth. the extra money. I got my TV on sale for $1680 with FREE shipping.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slightly larger screen than the largest LCD/LED TVs.. Much cheaper than Sony XBR8 and Pioneer Elite.. Slick menus and graphics.. Thin profile is awesome and ideal for wall mounting.. 
Cons:. Yahoo Widgets and online content are slow and a bit awkward without a keyboard.. DLNA Media playback has limited file format compatibility and clunky interface compared to some set top boxes.. No built in WiFi.. 
Summary:. The PN58B860 is an excellent choice for consumers who want a high end, network ready HDTV without spending $5,000. My Samsung is connected to my wired home network (with network attached storage). This makes it very easy to access music, pictures, and video without a computer.. With a HDMI equipped PC or laptop you can also play computer or internet based media with excellent quality (e.g. TV on Hulu.com).. The remote has ample functionality allowing single button access to audio, video, and screen resolution settings. It's very easy to use.. With many manufacturers exiting the plasma TV market, I was hard pressed to find a better plasma HDTV for the money. Also, Samsung customer support has been very responsove to my questions. You can manage just about any question or issue from Samsung.com. And I received a generous 6 month extension on my warranty for registering online.. If you don't want or don't need an internet based or home network HDTV for streaming media, then you may be better off with a less expensive plasma or LCD. But if you have high speed internet and $100 for a Samsung wirless adapter, then you're missing out on some great features.. 

$$;
Pros:. Once calibrated it has an incredible picture! HD content is as clear as I've ever seen. Color accuracy seems spot-on. Thinness of unit is a cool bragging point.. 
Cons:. Constant buzzing when TV is on. Loudest when your head is in line with the screen. Internal speakers do not sound good.. 
Summary:. I just got this TV last Saturday (4/17/10). I had it on for about an hour when I noticed the buzzing. Now, I can't help but hear it every time I turn the TV on. I'm not going to go into detail describing because it's the same sound that many others are experiencing. See other posts and threads in this forum and AVS forum. This is extremely disappointing to me. If it wasn't for the buzzing I would have given this TV 5 stars. The picture quality on HD content is as good as I've ever seen. The colors are so vibrant, but yet accurate. With CinemaSmooth on while watching a blu-ray I see no hint of blurring or judder. For optimal picture quality I highly recommend calibrating the TV to the settings in David's review (can't spell his last name). The only 2 settings I have tweaked is the color temp and black level enhancer (I think it's called that). I prefer the color temp of warm1 over warm2. I have the black level enhancer set to the 'darker' setting. This helps the display to achieve the "inky" blacks that it was missing. Cosmetically, the unit is very attractive. It's not flashy or busy. I want the image on the screen to stand-out over the actual unit. The slimness of the panel is not very important to me, but since this one is very thin it's a cool bragging point to my friends. Aside from the buzzing, which is a huge issue, the sound quality sounds strange to me. However I tweak the EQ, voices do not sound natural. The quality of the TV's internal speakers are also not very important to me. 90-95% of the time I'm watching TV I have my surround sound on. Overall I would highly recommend this TV if not for the buzzing. It sounds like many of the units within this model have a buzzing, but if you can find one that doesn't buzz, go for it!.

Pros:. Beautiful picture, elegant product design. Great sound quality. Menus are easy to use.. 
Cons:. TV does emit a noticeable buzzing sound, similar to some fluorescent lights. The buzzing sound varies in intensity depending on the tonality of what's onscreen. Not extremely loud, but can be annoying.. 
Summary:. I'm on my second unit, which buzzes as the original unit did. Not extremely loud, but loud enough to annoy at times, which is disappointing for a TV of this caliber. Original unit had a bad pixel, so I had to replace it. Good opportunity to see if all of these units buzz. Based on my experience, I'd say that it's likely they all buzz to some degree. I may keep the TV, as the picture quality and design are both excellent, and I've invested time and money. My advice to those want a 50" plasma, but haven't made the purchase yet, do not buy the Samsung PN50B860 if you are sensitive to noise..

Pros:. Profile and design are jaw-droppers, superb color saturation, deep and accurate blacks, contrasting is fabulous. 
Cons:. Buzzing sound.

The links above (thanks to the prior posting) are to sites/strings/forum boards discussing the screen buzz. On my non-wall mounted TV-stand set, as is noted by the other reviewers, the sound is heard mostly when sitting directly in front of the screen, up to approximately 15-feet away. With off-angle viewing, the sound diminishes, but is still present. The sound also changes with color/shade: some report a louder buzz with white/lighter images, while my set is with darker images. Adjusting the wires in the back has done nothing.. The GeekSquad commented that the problem has been isolated to a particular "batch" of televisions, and is due to a faulty fan in the set. Samsung was going to come and officially diagnose the problem, but I decided to replace the set (it's only 3-days old now).. Best Buy is VERY graciously replacing the set with another PN50B860, but if the forums' reports are proven, then I'm wearily expecting the replacement to buzz. If this second set buzzes, I will simply replace the set with a Panasonic Viera TCP50V10, which I feel is the best competition out there for the price.. All things considered, Best Buy has been very helpful, but CNET and other official reviewers have not addressed this issue or the host of strings detailing this very issue: for $2-2,500, I on't understand why such is the case.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture and looks awesome. 
Cons:. Buzzing sound is a big disappointment from a top of the line TV like the 860.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture...probably the best I've seen in a TV under $2500. Single panal glass design is great at reducing reflections and double reflection images.. 
Cons:. Terrible loud buzzing sound from the TV.. 
Summary:. I bought the PN50B860 TV and called Samsung to complain about the loud buzzing. It could be heard 20-30 feet from the TV, even with the sound on at normal listening levels. I don't have sensitive ears. I'm a middle aged guy, so my hearing isn't as good as it used to be. Samsung sent out a repair man to try to fix the loud buzzing. He replaced one of the circuit boards in the set, but that didn't help. Best Buy then replaced the TV with another one, but it also had the same loud buzzing sound from the circuit board. I ended up sending that one back to Best Buy. The Best Buy guys that picked up the set mentioned that they have had a lot of these TVs returned due to the loud buzzing. One of the Best Buy sales people also said they have had quite a few of these sets returned due to the loud buzzing sound. Interestingly, a couple of Samsung company reps said that they haven't had any problems with complaints about buzzing from this set. I guess that goes to show you can't believe Samsung company reps. I live in Minnesota, so altitude is not the issue. Other plasma sets I've seen don't have this buzzing problem, like the Samsung 550 series...or at least not buzzing that can be heard more than a couple feet from the TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1) Lack of firmware updates. 2) Lack of Netflix. 3) Firmware purposely disables previous firmware versions. 
Cons:. Nice hardware and competitive price. 
Summary:. I can't justify the price of the product given the lack of support for upgrading function and firmware which was marketed by Samsung. Very disappointing!. 

$$;
Pros:. This TV had an excellent visual appeal, amazing picture, and a great picture.. 
Cons:. The BUZZ is horrendous, and kills the user experience.. 
Summary:. I spent a lot of time deciding between this and the Panasonic TC-58V10. I went with the Samsung because the picture quality was comparable enough not to make a difference to me. I also thought the built-in widgets in the Samsung were better than Panasonic's, and I LOVED the 1.2 inch slim design. Then I plugged it in. I immediately noticed a loud buzzing that varied with the intensity of the image. This buzz is not coming from the speakers. It exists even while muted. I tried different outlets, and even turned off every other device on the same circuit. Same problem. I tried this to rule out line noise, even though my house was built in 2006 and is certainly up to code. The noise is coming from the panel. If you start reading the boards, you'll see that others have pulled their hair out with service techs trying to resolve this issue. This is not a matter of a faulty power supply. This is a DESIGN ISSUE! Not a single user reported a fix for this problem. (and surrounding it with foam or cranking up the volume is not a fix).. This TV is a good choice if you're DEAF. If you're like me, you expect that you should get what you pay for. $2400 for a TV should not give you a buzz. Buyer Beware..

Pros:. These plasmas are all show and no go. While the aesthetics, picture and feature set are excellent they are unermined by a loud and annoying buzzing sound emitted constantly even with the sounds turned off.. 
Cons:. These TVs buzz constantly! Totally unacceptable for a $2,000 TV. Check out the thread at avsforum. http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1144869. The Yahoo widgets are slow as molasses too!. 
Summary:. I can't believe David Katzmaier neglected to include the buzzing defect in his review. Escpecially since there are multiple threads about the buzz problem on CNET.com including the following:. http://forums.cnet.com/5208-13973_102-0.html?threadID=349119. http://forums.cnet.com/5208-13973_102-0.html?threadID=344409. Buyer beware!!!.

Pros:. The TV itself is beautiful, the picture is great. I also love the low profile design.. 
Cons:. This TV buzzes so loudly you will think a bumble bee is stuck in your ear. I called customer service - they sent a technician that told me I had purchased the wrong TV, and that I probably should have gone with either the 50" or a different model.. 
Summary:. Sheena B. #35 at customer service in Greenville SC was as rude as any person I have spoken with on the phone. I love Samsung, but I could not be more disappointed with how the treated me after purchasing this 58" TV. All I want is to be able to watch TV with my family and be able to hear what is going on. We have had to use subtitles and nothing is being done about it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful color. 
Cons:. Poor customer service; short life. 
Summary:. Before you buy any Samsung TV do an internet search for "samsung tv power supply problems." You'll find many complaints about a capacitor issue. If nothing else, buy an extended warranty.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful set, stunning picture, all the features you could want for a good price. This TV had everything I wanted and the picture was the best of any TV in the store.. 
Cons:. The horrible buzzing can be heard over the TV on volumne level 30.. 
Summary:. I had read the reviews noting a buzzing sound, so I checked out the TV in 4 different stores and did not hear any buzzing, so I broke down and took it home.. The second night I had the TV I fell asleep in with it on, and was awakened by an awful buzzing sound. I tried every adjustment on the TV to try and stop the buzzing to no avail. I have tried to contact Samsung regarding the problem, but the service rep they assigned to my problem only works 9-5, so I cannot get a hold of him. I cannot live with the buzzing it is giving me terrible headaches.. I am tempted to try a replacement set because the picture is so good, it has every feature I wanted, and the set itself looks great in my living room, but the buzzing noise is unbearable. If this problem were to occur outside of the stores return date I would be screwed, because I do not think this is covered by the manufacturers warranty.. Please do not make the same mistake I did and disregard the User Reviews of this TV. The buzzing is a serious defect and the manufactuer and the editors are ignoring this problem.. Buyer Beware the Buzzing noise is real..
