Upon very close inspection to the element (after it cooled off), I notice one of the ceramic pieces that hold a coil was broken off and the coil was touching the casing.
When I went back in the laundry room about 30 minutes later, it was incredibly hot in there, so I felt the dryer and it was very hot to the touch.
I got a warehouse deal "LIKE NEW" and when I installed it, the coil got hot with the timer switch "on" but the dryer wasn't running.
This unit is going back, and I guess I know why it was in the "used" bin.
It worked! Well, I'm not taking any chances with this thing getting hot like it did the coil slips off the broken holder and grounds out again.
I found a youtube video where the guy says the heater element is grounded out and will stay on.
I shut it off, unplugged and proceeded to see what the problem was.
I flipped the coil back on the ceramic holder and plugged it back in.
I don't blame the manufacturer, it's just a broken unit that got re-sold.
So in other words, I turned on the dryer to time dry 30 mins, but didn't start the tumbler yet.
