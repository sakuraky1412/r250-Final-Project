i would recommend this camera to everyone  .
i have read many reviews about this camera before i bought it  .
now i feel i took right decision buying this  .
there could be other cameras with more mp and features , but this one for sure takes pictures with excellent quality .
had this camera for over 6 months now , like i said up top , i love this camera more every time i use it , the advantages weigh over the disadvantages big time  .
first digital camera i've ever owned and it's awesome  .
a would recommend this to a friend and i will .
i bought this camera after getting a brand    new casio that took very blurry pictures right out of the box  .
the sony dsc    h20 is by far the finest camera i've ever owned when taking into consideration the features and price  .
the carl zeiss lens is of course one of the best selling points of this camera , as it offers optical image stabilization in addition to digital image stabilization rather than relying wholly on the internal processor to handle the stabilization the pictures are very sharp , with great color definition no noticeable blur , and pristine detail  .
th internal red    eye reduction feature also works very well , and does not overwrite the original , but rather saves as a new file  .
i didn't find the zoom to be overly noisy , but as a point of information , the lens does not take very wide shots at 1x  .
this is not a negative for me , just something that might displease some people movie mode impressed me greatly  .
i have a nice panasonic minidv camcorder , and the video quality with the dsc    h20 blows it out of the water  .
i couldn't believe the audio quality , and the video quality is very good for the price of this camera  .
many cameras that cost twice the dsc    h20 didn't offer hd video recording , which again puts this camera up at the top for its class  .
the zoom is fully    functioning in movie mode , though it operates much slower than when taking photos  .
some complain that the audio is only mono , when the video is 720p  .
i would understand this as a valid concern if this is a $2000 video camera , but it's not  .
i paid twice the cost of this camera for my camcorder , and now that camcorder is going up on ebay , along with the flip video camera as a few final notes , there is no hdmi output on this camera  .
this may be a drawback , but as a hd component cable is available , no big deal  .
it would be nice to have that option for the convenience of playback when visiting relatives or friends , but personally i like to edit and burn my videos , so for me , no points lost in that department  .
some complain about the high cost of batteries  .
why this is , i don't know  .
if you can write a review , you can search ebay  .
i found 2 high    quality generic brand batteries for $10 each  .
the batteries use japanese cells and have an internal microchip , and offer a longer life than the sony brand battery  .
memory stick pro duo cards were also very cheap on ebay  .
i picked up 2 sony brand 16gb cards for a whopping $45 , including shipping  .
cannot beat that  .
so to all those who were dissatisfied with this camera , beats me what you're complaining about  .
this camera rocks , and i'd highly recommend it to anyone trying to find a high    quality camera that wo not break the bank .
my wife and i have owned three sony cyber    shot cameras and have enjoyed them all  .
they are easy to use and take very good pictures  .
this model is a bit bigger , and that should be considered , because the beauty of a point and shoot is the ability to easily carry it around  .
but the great pictures and the hd video (with use of the zoom) override any concerns about the size and weight of the camera .
so i am a very picky individual so picky that this is the 4th digital camera i have bought in the last two weeks  .
i have gone with other brands and other recommendations from friends and sales representatives , all of which by the way kept pointing me to the panasonic lumix dmc    25 , which i did buy as well , it however it went back along with the others (the pictures were either dark , or not in focus) after much research and reading many reviews i went with this sony and very glad i have  .
guess what , it's not going back to the store , right out of the box it took spectacular pictures i am a novice photographer , and a bit intemadated buy the price and features of the big dlsr's  .
this camera is a comfortable medium from the standard point and shot to the big slr's all in all i am very happy with it and would suggest giving it a try .
simply put , it does everything i need , and then some  .
my original idea is to buy a camcorder , but this accomplishes great pictures and hd video into one affordable product  .
with a spare battery , you really have to work at draining the battery  .
as much as people want to wine about memory stick cards , they are affordable if you look around  .
the camera requires memory stick pro duo because of the high transfer rate i went a step further and bought a pro duo mark 2  .
8gb sony for $24  .
99 on amazon all in all , great product  .
very pleased and worth the 5 stars , even with a few minute negatives .
i went out and bought a cannon powershot just to try a different company and is very unhappy with the indoor pictures it took i is not impressed with the camera at all so i took it back and bought this sony gald i did i love the pictures it takes very clear and i really love the auto focus  .
my family and i have owned sony digital cameras for as long as i can remember and have never been unhappy will stick with sony from now on  .
i is looking for a point shoot cam since i bought a dslr sony a300 (which i really like) so i can carry it on my pocket for those occasions that i cannot have a big cam on my neck without sacrificing great pix i checked and compared and fell in love with the h20 i decided to purchase and it is a great decision  .
impressed on how small and compact for a zoom cam and the pix it took are awesome  .
the video it took is great  .
720p cannot complain about that  .
this is one of my factors buying this cam cuz of it's hd recording taking pix was fffasssttt  .
(although sometimes focusing is sluggish but depends on the settings) all in all i highly recommend it if your looking for an easy portable cam that takes dslr like pix  .
i say cnet should review this and if they say it's not a great camera they are wrong .
i am by far a professional photographer  .
i just received my camera today and i am loving it  .
i am still trying to figure out a lot of the functions and how to achieve my desired pictures  .
it is really pretty easy to figure out how to use it  .
the pics are very sharp and the color is great  .
you can edit your photos on the camera  .
i would recommend this camera to someone who is wanting more than an easy point and shoot  .
i researched a lot of different cameras for a couple of weeks and this one stood out for my price range  .
this site helped a lot  .
best digital camera i own  .
i would recommend this camera to anyone  .
i used it on a 2 wk trip to europe and it is great for landscapes , buildings , museums , and people .
i love this camera  .
it's not the prettiest camera i've seen , but the photo quality is excellent in my opinion , and there are a lot of functions to play around with  .
you an change aperture and other manual settings  .
for an amateur photographer who sometimes needs more zoom than 3 or 4x , this camera is awesome , and at a very low price (i got it for $250 at best buy    there may be lower prices) highly recommended .
very good camera , nice options , recommend it for anyone .
overall a high end package which has got something for every kind of user should find a place in between the basic digital cameras and the slrs  .
the picture quality is great even at maximum without much of spots  .
this thing alone should convince a lot of the buyers as most of the pics we all shoot are not in the best of the light conditions go for it if you have been having a basic digi cam for long and if you wish to up the kind of pics you would like to take  .
great value for the price you pay $stars (4  .
5 stars)  .
i wanted to get a mega zoom camera that is still relatively small  .
i researched quite a few and just felt the most comfortable with the sony  .
i am very happy with my choice so far  .
i had a panasonic camera previously and is not happy at all with the battery life or photo quality  .
it came down to this camera or the casio ex    h10  .
i had a casio in the past and the battery life is amazing , but the reviews all pointed to the sony  .
sony products are usually the best and i am happy with my choice  .
the picture quality is top notch and the video is amazing , with the optical zoom a huge bonus in the video  .
the placement of the cord on the bottom of the camera is very strange  .
when you plug in the camera to upload to a computer or to view on a tv , you have to rest the camera either on the lens side or screen side , neither of which are good options  .
i is slightly disappointed that i had to shell out an extra $39  .
99 to get a cable to hook up to my hdtv  .
all in all , the camera is great and i love it so far .
this camera really takes nice pictures , and it is super fast  .
i bought my wife a canon and she is always complaining that it is too slow and made her miss shots  .
this thing is ultra    fast 90% of the time  .
and the picture quality is a bit better and more consistent than the canon that preceded it the feel of the camera is alos worth mentioning  .
it just feels like a very well built piece of machinery  .
a quality electronic device for sure the lens is a great quality karl ziess lens that is a better lens , imo , than the nikkor lens of the cannon  .
it is a very , very nice lens .
while i despise the sony memory stick  .
the cameras overall features are great for this price range  .
i am very satisfied with my decision to purchase this camera .
i'm not a photographer , besides my iphone this is the first camera i've ever owned , so keep that in mind while reading my review  .
i can say that since i've gotten this camera , i've been reading as much as i can about improving the quality of my pictures , and i've learned quite a bit , but i'm certainly still a beginner in every since of the word from my untrained eye , this camera produces great image quality  .
the pictures are crisp and the colors look outstanding  .
i generally use the camera in it's auto mode , giving up control to a computer which undoubtably does a better job at picking the settings than i currently can in just about every situation  .
however there is the option to manual pick many of your settings , which i hope to get better with as i learn more about photography and this camera  .
overall picture quality has been great  .
i did notice that when i is trying to take a picture of a spider spinning a web that the camera kept focusing on the background and not the spider  .
i couldn't figure out how to do a manual focus , so i lost the shot  .
i'm pretty sure there is some kind of limited manual focus option , i just haven't figured it out yet the zoom is probably one of the bigger selling points to this camera , and i can tell you that it didn't disappoint  .
it's got a nice x10 optical zoom , and then you can zoom in further due to the high megapixal count (i think it's something around x8)  .
apparently you can also buy an after market lens that fits this camera that increases the optical zoom by another x1  .
7 , bringing your total optical zoom to x17  .
currently i have no need for that kind of zoom , but it's satisfying to know that i can upgrade this feature if necessary later on  .
i also believe the additional lens can be fitted with filters , which at this point i'm not really sure how one would even use them another big selling point of this camera is the video capabilities  .
it takes hd video clips for up to 30 minutes at a time  .
you can take as many videos as you can fit on your memory card  .
personally this is not a big thing to me and i've only done a short test video , it looked fine on the lcd screen  .
apparently you can use the cord they provide to hook it up to your hdtv as well and watch the video , but i haven't done this yet  .
you can also zoom in while filming , this is something that i heard is missing from the previous model i guess i haven't mentioned it yet , but the 3 lcd screen is great  .
it's very bright and you can easily see it in direct sunlight pretty much all point and shoot cameras have some lag between pushing the button and the camera actually taking the picture , but i haven't really noticed this with this camera  .
if you just push the button down without focusing first , there is some lag ; but if you hold it half way down for autofocus , it seems like it takes pictures the instant you push the rest of the way down the camera comes with a rechargable battery , which more than lasts me an entire day of walking around taking pictures  .
i do turn off the camera when i'm not expecting to take a picture , and i've probably only taken about 200 photos in a single day  .
so if you leave your camera on , or take over 300 pictures a day , i'm not sure how the battery will hold up  .
for most users i think they'll find it does fine when i bought this camera , the one thing that really made me love it is the way it felt in my hands  .
it's something i guess i don't really know how to write about , but it just felt good  .
while the materials feel similar to the same as the thoughs used on all other cameras in this price range , it just felt better made and comfortable  .
it kind of reminded me of my fathers old camera from when i is a kid  .
i do not think this camera is retro , but it's got a retro feel to it that some may appreciate in conclusion , this thing takes great pictures and offers a nice feature set that most people will be happy with  .
there are auto settings that work great , some advanced auto settings , and some limited manual settings  .
i'd recommend this camera to just about everyone looking for a better than average , dang near great point and shoot camera  .
it's no dslr , but that's fine with me for right now , and if you're looking into point and shoots , it's probably fine with you too .
would recommend this device to friends  .
i took the opportunity to put a mini review myself  .
this can be found at http  //rayazsden  .
blogspot  .
com/2009/09/camera    review    sony    cyber    shot    dsc    h20b  .
html some photos taken from the camera can also be found here  .
hope it helps you in making your purchase decision .
once you've tried it you will love it  .
i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good camera  .
honestly i bought this camera because i had a ton of best buy gift certificates and sony as the only new mega zoom compact camera that is available  .
however i am very happy with it  .
yes it's a little bulky and probably wont fit into jean pockets (shorts and khakis it will) but the 10x zoom is amazing , which also works when filming video (not all cameras do)  .
picture quality is great , a lot of settings on camera , but if you just want to point and shoot the auto settings work great my biggest irk is the dumb lense cap , it is so annoying and has showed up in my videos somethins because it swings around  .
almost every camera out there has auto closing lens cover , for the price range of the sony it should of had it too  .
also memory stick's are expensive and the editing software that came with it is way too confusing for me so i just stick with google's picassa overall great camera , great hd video , great pics , easy to use just a little bulky and lens cap is a small annoyance .
i would have loved to keep this camera , but i could not afford $50 every 290 shots  .
it take great photo  .
this camera is a perfect for those looking for a handy , user friendly camera .
i compared few pictures taken with sony dsc    h20 with pictures taken with 5 years old olympus c    740 ultrazoom  .
the same objects , the same time  .
olympus won the competition every time in regards to everything   sharpnes , colors , focus etc .
see cons  .
reading the cnet review , there is a line buried somehwere in the middle , colors , while not entirely accurate , were nonetheless pleasing and natural  .
excuse me , cnet reviewer  .
i have owned 5 digital cameras over the years , mostly kodaks , and i have never had the color so innnacurate as this sony camera  .
how the cnet reviewer considers this only an afterthought and not important to the camera rating is beyond me  .
to elaborate , any pictures taken with the flash on came out way too light , with the flash off they came out a little better  .
any indoor picture the automatic settings say the camera needs a flash  .
i am going to get rid of this camera and get another kodak , i asm not interested in a camera where the color is off on all the pictures while i'm sure you can probably start fiddling with iso settings and other modes , that defeats the whole point of a digital camera  .
with the kodak cameras that i have owned over the years , i is ablr to take gorgeous pictures without having to change a single setting  .
this is clearly not the case with the sony dsc    h20 .
to all of you that claim to take good photos  .
how on earth do you do and what setup do you use  .
fully manual mode and a millions setups changed  .
please tell me how get good photos or i will send it back to where i bought it updated  .

EASY TO USE AND UNDERSTAND LAYOUT ON CAMERA,TAKES GREAT PICS ,IT HAS OPTIONAL TELE &#38;WIDE ANGLE ,LENSES YOU CAN GET ON SONYS WEBSITE,NEED TO GET ADAPTOR RING ALSO.; LENS CAP- REMEMBERING TO TAKE OFF AND PUTTING BACK ON EVERY TIME YOU SHOOT!
Great quality pictures. 10X Optical Zoom is nice and smooth. Shutter speed is quick. Face Detection and Smile mode are very cool.; Sony's Memory Stick is too proprietary.
Nice size for the megazoom. Well designed layout.; Below average picture quality. Excessive use of the flash. Disputable focusing.
Sleek design,HD video,10x optical zoom while recording video,manual controls.; terribly noisy during zooming, poor image quality,blurry images,no use of the DRO, poor battery life,night shots are not perfect,cannot take wide pictures.
Takes great pictures, easy to use; Not much I didn't like about this camera, until I went to get a new battery. SONY (G) batteries are $50 at Walmart (cheapest)
The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H20 is an all-around excellent camera. But!; Hate the whole remove the battery to charge.
Very easy to use, and it takes EXCELLENT pictures!; Just not a huge fan of Sony's proprietary memory card and USB cables
Excellent picture quality, high zoom, great movie quality, overall great bang for the buck; No HDMI output, manual lens cap
Price. I bought it at $250.00. Nothing meets this camera's price and functionality.. 10x zoom.. Separate battery recharger.. Spare batteries are dirt cheap. Full, bright 3" viewscreen.. 720p 30fps video with zoom. WOW!. --Compact, sleek casing.; -Zooming emits soft noise during video. Not noticeable if drowned out by other noises (traffic on streets, concerts, etc).. -Not wide angle.. -Pop up flash (prefer built in). -Flimsy battery/memory stick door.
Ehhh ? Takes fast pictures .; Photo quality. SO Much Noise and blur , Worst camera i have ever had . How on earth do you get good pictures that doesn`t look 50 years old ? Bulky , Low battery life , expensive , Zoom control jams sometimes , takes very poor long zoom photos .
ease of use, size, video quality and capabilities, can use as point and shoot or use more advanced features; manual lens cap is a pain
It takes good pics and video. i like the EZ menu/setup.; Bulky... battery seems to last 10 minutes! The battery compartment cover is 'flimsy' and easily broken (as with most). The cover is a pain.
Great pictures, easy to use, great HD video with optical zoom, very good battery life, lots of options; Manual lens cap, poor placement of cable to connect to computer/TV, no HD cable included to hook up to TV (needs to be purchased separately)
Love how you can edit photos on the camera.. Clear and sharp pictures.. Great zoom.; Have to remove lens cap to turn on.. Have to remove battery to charge.
Great pics, easy to use, automatic adjustment. Sony has kept me as for another sony purchase 2nd camera. For the size best camera out there!; Lens cap and opening the door for charging the battery.
10x Zoom, HD Video, Easy to use, but has advance settings if you want them; A little bulky compared to the new Mega Zoom Compact Cameras out there. Hate the Lens Cap (very old fashioned). Not a fan of expensive Sony Memory Sticks.
Takes great pictures, has a terrific zoom, offers a good level of control for a beginner, and feels great in the hand.; Like most point and shoots, auto adjustments don't know exactly what you're looking for. Has only been an issue for a couple of shots though.
Takes awsome pix. Easy to use. Miniaturized DSLR like feel (you can operate with just your thumb movin)! ZOOM's superb for a very slim cam! HD 720p videos nice! Battery life excellent!; No automatic cover for the lens. "Thumbprint magnet" on the lcd screen. Cover can be easily broken but bearable. Noisy when focusing on video recording. Mono sound on video recording.
Great picture quality. Well built. Super fast. Compact. Great zoom. Everything you could ask for in a mega zoom camera.; Sony and their memory stick. Although it is a fast stick, I still had to invest in another memory stick. Of course, the way prices have come down, it really doesn't matter.
HD Video and Video Zoom, 10X optical and 20X digital zoom, Settings for every photo preference. TV Cord hookup. Awesome pictures, Can put Telephoto lens on (Separate) to extend zoom. Just like a mini SLR, I can't say how much I love it.; Lens cap a pain, no manual viewfinder, Not very pocket friendly but it will fit some pants. LCD screen isn't scratch proof
- Powerful flash for makes good indoor close ups. - Good image stabilization. - Good Macro photos. - HD video is great outdoors with super auto focusing. - The build quality of the camera is very good. - Decent battery life (200-280 shots); - Short lag when taking photos indoors (Burst mode resolves this). - Not true wide angle (38mm). - Lens cover implementation clumsy. - Only two aperture sizes in manual mode. - Low light videos grainy
A great camera to have, whether for outdoor or indoor purpose. Picture quality is excellent. Use of 10x optical zoom in both still imaging and video mode is amazing. HD video quality is superb. Auto Smile detection is a plus. Finally, you pay less :); 1.Auto Lens Cap should have given.. 2. PC connector/USB cable port for camera is not in a good place, you have to keep LCD screen/Lens facing down while copying to PC.
It has got amazing clarity and good detail at maximum zoom. For a person who wants to just keep clicking without working on finer details, the easy mode matched very well to the best pics a pro would take. The battery life is also good.; The LCD screen on the back should help u lot with finger print matching. Get a screen cover for that. Definitely needed.
great pictures....indoors and out, rechargeable batteries, very easy to use even before reading the user guide.; None really some people find that having to cover and uncover the lens with the cap a pain not a big deal for me.
photo quality, double-shot for flash and no-flash, image steadying, takes video and audio with zoom!, 10x zoom, big lcd screen, 10.1 megapixels is more than enough (I don't blow up pictures to print posters etc.); location of the USB connector (on bottom of camera), size of the connector cable (very bulky), lens cap, shape of camera makes it difficult to find a good case (only have about 2 choices that I can find...), camera itself isn't super "pretty"
