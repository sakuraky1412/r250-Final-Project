as i was making my reservation online , i was excited looking over the pictures of the property that surrounds the grand hyatt tampa bay .
there 's a cool nature walk the leads out into the wetlands and several very good restaurants on property .
the property itself is quite pretty , staff are friendly and helpful , but i experienced lots of little annoyances during my stay that seemed out-of-character for a hyatt property with a `` grand '' name .
when i first arrived , i noticed that my room ( with a lovely view of the bay ) was quite warm despite the a/c being on .
a call to maintenance , which was promptly addressed , uncovered that the filter had not been changed for quite some time and was visibly clogged with dust ( one of several indicators that hyatt is not investing in maintenance and upkeep as it should ) .
even with a new filter , the a/c struggled to keep the room below 75 degrees during the day .
the wireless internet , while free , would slow down so badly in the evening that it was practically unusable .
two calls to tech support on two separate days confirmed that the system was operational but the utilization/network traffic was so high it was the cause of the slowness .
yes , the bed was comfortable , rooms and bathrooms were modern and up-to-date , but that just did n't make up for all the little things -- that added up -- to make for a mediocre stay in a pretty hotel . . .
