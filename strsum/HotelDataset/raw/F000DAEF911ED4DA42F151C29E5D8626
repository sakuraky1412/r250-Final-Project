this has to be one of the best modern hotels we have ever stayed in .
we were greeted by gadika who gave us a glass of wine and lemonade .
we then went to our room via the disco elevator to look at the fantastic views .
the room was retro and funky with great decor , tea and top quality coffee , a record player where you can get more lp 's from the lobby and play them in your room .
the bathroom had heated floors with a spacious shower and all of the shampoos , soaps were great .
the view from the room was stunning and you can access the roof top free with even better views of amsterdam .
the staff were extremely friendly and helpful for example at breakfast we were asked by raymond if we wanted an umbrella to borrow to go out as it was raining .
we ate in the butchers restaurant and the food was excellent .
the breakfast was very very good with a buffet of continental food , juices and then you order your cooked breakfast from the menu .
the place is spotlessly clean and even though it is not currently advertised it does have a gym see the pictures i have added .
the location is excellent just over the river from the central train station with a free water ferry to and from the hotel .
if you want a really good experience in a modern fantastic hotel with brilliant staff . . .
