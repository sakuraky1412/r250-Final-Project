Pros:. I highly recommend this camera fits perfectly in your hand not to small or to big the buttons you use the most when your recording are placed right where their suppose to be right at your finger tips. Picture quality is very very bright beautifull colors. 
Cons:. none. 

$$;
Pros:. It is small.. 
Cons:. I takes about a min. to changa DVD's. In my line of work that can be 59 sec. too long!!!!. 
Summary:. I am a P.I. and I use it for work. It has served me well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small &#38; Lightweight, Easy to Shoot Video. 
Cons:. Small Toggle "Stick" is a Pain to Control for Menu Items. 
Summary:. Going from Analog to Digital with this DVD Camera was initally difficult from an editing standpoint using -RW disks. Write Once (-R) disks were fine, but I preferred to be able to keep using the disks over to save $$$$. Of course, the Digital images shot were 100 times better than the analog I was use to. (I never tried Digital Tape). Re: Editing Software, even Sony Technicians instructed me to get different software from what they provided. PowerDirector-4 solved all my problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great camera. Additionally, with this cam I was able to convert all my old VHS-C movies to DVD with excellent quality.. 
Cons:. Loading or unloading a DVD from this cam can be a little tricky.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy, Easy ,Easy! I wanted to be able to video my kids at sporting events, ballet Etc. This is perfect for me. It's very light to carry around and the little disks are easy to store. Perfect for me.. 
Cons:. Not good for someone who likes to play around with video. You can't edit on these, but I never did that with my old one.. 

$$;
Pros:. I posted a review "Michael Killingsworth on 03-Oct-2004 12:00:45 AM" where I said not to purchase mainly because of the lack of software for editing. Well...I found software...and it works good. I found that Ulead VideoStudio with the Dolby (AC3 pack add. 
Cons:. It has taken some time to get used to holding the camera still while shooting. Otherwise all is now great since I found editing software.. 

$$;
Pros:. I am a techy guy, but lazy. Just load your DVD shoot, finalise and watch it. If you want to edit you can (but I hardly do it, unless it's a special occassion). Qulity is great not as good as mini DVs, but works fine for me.. 
Cons:. Wish soon there will be media to record more than 30 mins. Wish it had a better still picture resolution. 

$$;
Pros:. Small easy to use! Point shoot, finalize and play in the DVD player. If you're into serious editing, look else where. Good battery life. If you want an easy to use and share video camera, this is it... I borrowed a friend's DCR101 and took video with no i. 
Cons:. The zoom is a bit "touchy", but with some experience, it tolerable. View find takes a bit of getting used to - kind of small, but with the LCD screen, why bother.... 

$$;
Pros:. Small and easily carried. Very easy to record to mini DVD, finalize it and view it on any DVD player. Good zoom (takes a little learning to use it well) Doubles as both a digital camera and a Camcorder. Nice fade in, fade out feature. Plan to use the RW d. 
Cons:. PC Software is terrible (not just the included Sony software). Several commercial software titles tried but none knew how to read directly from the disk (they want to read from the USB cable - slow download to your PC). Sony Tech support is extremely poo. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, well designed and can go from recording to playing in a DVD player instanatly. 
Cons:. Disc on lasts 30 mins. 

$$;
Pros:. This is a nice camcorder it stacks up well against the competition regardless of recording medium. Feels solid, lcd doesn't wash out in the sunlight, small form factor and great image quality. The main reason I bought this because I wanted I wanted to g. 
Cons:. Editing not worth the trouble. DVD only holds 25 minutes at standard quality vs about an hour on Mini DV tape (I find that to be plenty). 

$$;
Pros:. Fun Camcorder, I enjoy the ease of operation and playback.. 
Cons:. What it's missing is Power Director 3 software. After much research, I found gocyberLink.com. The same company that makes the very popular PowerDVD playback for PC's; also has the only editing software that I could find that includes the Dolby Digital/A. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, video quality, and features make this a very attractive camcorder. DVD media is really cool, but pitfalls of editing your movies may not be worth price. I read all the on-line reviews and still made the mistake of purchasing DCR-DVD201. I own thr. 
Cons:. This is where the camera fails and the only reason I recommend that you not purchase it. If you do not edit your video and have no intention of doing so (and can live with 1 mega-pixel stills)&then buy it you will love it; However, if you want to or thin. 

$$;
Pros:. Produces great images. Compact and lightweight - fits right in my purse.. 
Cons:. Unable to find an editing program which is compatible with this camcordor. The ImageMixer Program I can do without. Tried Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5 and Sony Movie Studio - able to import video directly from pc but was not receiving any sound - also unable. 

$$;
Pros:. dvd feature is very convenient for playback. an affordable dvd handycam. cool design and great features, specially night shot. good video quality and overall features.. 
Cons:. difficult to edit in pc other than with the bundled pixela software. video quality is same as sony dcr-ch40, which is cheaper by $300. still images still 1 MP. i would prefer a built-in lens cover like that of the sony minidvs.. 

$$;
Pros:. High quality video.. 
Cons:. Camera records to mini-dvd's with 30 minutes of recording time. You'll want to be able to copy your movies to a large, 2 hour dvd but won't be able to; at least no one at Sony can tell me how.. 

$$;
Pros:. Since the audio is AC3 you will need to download AC3 codec. Which is free and availalble on line. Or you can buy PowerDirector 3 for Cyberlink which support AC3 and Streaming MPEG2 VOB files. I am looking to by this product and I would think that this s. 

$$;
Pros:. Great design. The ability to moved directly from the camera to the DVD player is great.. 
Cons:. The resolution isn't as good as my DVR Handycam. On top of the image problems, the video editing software provided with this product is worthless. It will output to MPG format, but the process is very difficult as well as EXTREMELY time consuming. I am. 

$$;
Pros:. The movies that I shoot are very good, it's compact easy to use. I like it a lot for movies. 
Cons:. It's one of the worst cameras I've ever bought for still pictures. I bought the external video flash and it still takes just average pictures. The ImageMixer software is the most unfriendly software I've ever used, it stinks. 

$$;
Pros:. SMALL AND DVD FORMAT. 
Cons:. I DONT KNOW ABOUT THESE OTHER PEOPLE BUT I EDIT ALL MY HOME VIDEOS..THIS CAMERA HAS TERRIBLE EDITING SOFTWARE AND THERE IS NO OTHER SOFTWARE COMPATIBLE FOR THIS CAMERA..THE OTHER PERSON THAT WROTE "YOU JUST HAVE TO GET A MPEG2 SOFTWARE" IS WRONG!!MPEG2 SO. 

$$;
Pros:. IT IS NICE TO BE ABLE TO POP THE DVD I JUST RECORDED RIGHT INTO MY DVD PLAYER..VERY COMPACT..GOOD PICTURE QUALITY ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS AS GOOD AS CAMERAS THAT USE TAPE... 
Cons:. FIRST WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT...I WAITED AND DID NOT BUY LAST YEARS MODEL , THINKING THEY WOULD WORK OUT THE BUGS..SO I BOUGHT A SONY DCR-DVD201 IN MAY OF 2004 AND WAS EXICITED AFTER READING ALL THE GREAT REVEIWS ON THE PRODUCT.... 

$$;
Pros:. Good Outdoor picture quality and no spinning sound as previously noted by other reviers in the previous models. That's about the most postitive features.. 
Cons:. I waited for this 2nd generation model to hit the market but I was nothing but disappointed. I purchased the DVD 201 through a retail chain 2 week ago and I see many yellow dots on the screen and it actually records to the DVD. It does not seem to happen. 

$$;
Pros:. Sony quality hardware. 
Cons:. 250 characters are not enough to write the cons. Pixela software required to download the vids to computer =&gt; NOT Vista or Mac compatible. Unreliable video format and duration. Expensive dvds. Sony/PIxela will charge (about 80 $) if you ever loose the CD. 
Summary:. I remember paying 1200 for this piece of work... now...it's 400...BUYERS beware...for 400 $ you can buy a HD 40Gb JVC camcorder and save yourself money and headaches... I will give this camera away to my kids to play with.... 

$$;
Pros:. none. Don't bother buying. 
Cons:. everything - dials too small, can't use/manage/edit video at all. 
Summary:. Nothing in the box tells you that you can't actually make a DVD from the movie you shoot. You can't play back the MPEGs that are created from the software, Image Mixer that is included because the format using some uncompatible sound format. You can't rip the IFO file off because it's encrypted. I have spend days and days and this camera is a complete waste of time and money. Don't bother.. 

$$;
Pros:. You can record three disc or more on one battery charge.. 
Cons:. See novel bellow, too many to list.. 
Summary:. I shall never, ever, i repeat, ever purchase another sony product for the remainded of my life. Besides further aggrevating me with runaournd brainles emails form tech support, Sony knows they screwed up releasing this camera. It's obviouse by looking at the newest models that quickly replace this family. But hey, let's hit the bad points.... 1. HORRIBLE INDOORS - My 1996 RCA VHS-C Does 100X Better and I bought it for 200 bucks, not 800.. 2. Does not capture fast action without pixel-jizzle. (Cant really explain the term, but blurry blocks while in fast motion.. 3. Screwy software, no suprise, and screwy audio/video codec that does not work with hardly any app except the pixela, which what in the world does this program REALLY DO besides convert the screwy format to MPEG-2 with even worse quality?. 4. 20mins in high qaulity, false advertisment on the 60 min. DVD-RWs, they are double-sided for god sakes! You have to flip them over to use the other 30min. GIVE ME A BREAK!!!. 5. Blantanly lies about "Superior Video Qaulity" stated in the advertisments. like mentioned earlier my 1995 cam has better color reproduction anywhere anyplace and antyime.. 6. Sony basically told me to go sit on a pole because their products are "Perfect".. Oh yeah one good thing is that it takes barely acceptable video outdoors in noon sunlight.. This camera is WAY to leaning on the infrared light sources even after disabling all infrared features, color reproduction is horible, example pinks are peach, purples are grey, sony should be sued for ripping off america.. Bottom line.. BAD SONY!!! BAD... Go to you room. I'm willing to trade for the panasonic dvd that is 200 bucks cheaper than my sony. Or even one of the older sony digi 8s, back when sony made a good product. I hate my camera, and i'm stuck with it. This camera sucks so bad, even the dealers on ebay have difficulty finding suckers.. And if you reading this sony, i tried for 4 months for you to resolve this issue, and all i have it the pole you told me to go sit on.. 

$$;
Pros:. DVD recording media. 
Cons:. Very over priced Low Optical Zoom Low Digital Zoom Very limited recording time per each DVD.
