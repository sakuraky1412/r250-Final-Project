Great Hotel with Great Rooms .
Rooms in similar hotels would usually be about $250, 300 .
Rooms were nicely furnished .
Rooms in this hotel are noisy though .
Rooms are dated, our corner room's bathroom was shabby .
Great Location Nice Rooms Loved the Swissotel !
Rooms at the hotel are getting somewhat tired .
Strange, we thought, since we had booked conceirge level rooms .
Got to hotel, rooms weren't ready yet .
Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .
Expensive Parking but great rooms .
Rooms very spacious and clean .
Very pretty rooms with an European flair .
Great location but rooms need some work .
We   and, unfortunately, got to stay in three different rooms .
But we really did spend very little time in our rooms .
But I guess they have to make money somehow since they practically give their rooms away .
Our rooms   were still not ready by 8pm .
from other rooms but not nearly bad enough for us not to stay there again .
Rooms were clean, good sized and great views of Navy Pier .
