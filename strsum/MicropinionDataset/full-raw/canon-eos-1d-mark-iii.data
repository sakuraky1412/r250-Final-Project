i've used this for nature and sports photography for 18 mths and its been superb  .
i've fortunately never had any major af problems though canon's recalibration of the outer af points in early 2009 has resulted in even better ai servo performance  .
now easily the best af i've used (better than 1diin) .
i rented a 1d mark iiifor a weekend as i plan on buying a new professional body soon  .
i have read many of the criticisms of the autofocus and i purposely waited to see what canon would do about them  .
the updated model i got performed flawlessly  .
i had no problems with the autofocus in bright sunlight or lowlight conditions  .
as for the flawed cameras , i never got a chance to see the problems other than those that were shown on the websites  .
ordinarily and after such a test i would buy this camera and still may do so , however , there will soon be an announcement of its replacement (within 60 days) don't ask how i know  .
let's just say the rumors are close to the truth  .
even still this is a formitable machine and worthy of its ratings by cnet  .
(and no , i do not work for them or canon  .
the focus issue (which is minor) is now fixed , so ignore all those reviews from people who've never even seen one of these cameras sorry nikon , but canon still has a lead in the pro dslr segment  .
specs do not show how truly superior the 1d    mk3 (and the 1ds    mk3) are to the nikon d3 , but experienced shooters who've used both will see that the canon's image quality is higher , despite a slightly lower pixel count  .
the 1dmk3 performs at top speed with all features active , the nikon d3 cheats to achieve full speed the most visible difference is seen in the quality of the final image  .
the 1dmk3 is sharper at every iso , with noise just as well controlled  .
highlight tone priority gives the 1dmk3 a 1    stop advantage in dynamic range that's a big deal most pros are bound by their collection of lenses  .
the 1dmk3 from canon gives canon shooters reason to be happy , they continue to have the world's best dslr series to go with the world's larges and best collection of lenses .
anyone who wants to shoot with one of the best cameras , and get the best resulted , will be happy with this camera .
blindingly fast , clean shots , same of better keeper rates that my 1diin (lots better than 20d or 5d for sports) love the live view for helping focus manual focus lenses , along with the 10x zoom make the zeiss lenses easy to use ability to 'fine tune' focus on individual lenses for focus saves $250 a body and $130 a lens paying canon to match them  .
using exposure bracketing +    2ev , high speed drive (10fps) and setting drive limit to 3 consecutive shots makes taking bracketted shots to be converted to hdr (either photoshop or photomatix) a breeeze .
i put about 700 images on it every 3    4 days and this camera rocks  .
i looked into this camera a lot before i got and is up and down on it  .
i then i got and love it  .
i am sure there are people out there that have had problems with it but for me so far so great  .
i have had eos 1 cameras before but not like this one  .
the af is super fast  .
the iq is sweet and the hole thing is built like a tank .
we purchased this camera for an in    house digital photo studio  .
we used to use a simple rebel xt  .
for catalog quality printing across 300 manufacturers and hundreds of thousands of parts , this camera turned our mediocre studio into a powerhouse  .
the other reviewer who gave a 3 out of 10 for the autofocus failed to evaluate the camera in its' entirety  .
the autofocus can be as useful and automatic as you want or as manual as one would prefer  .
if i would be forced to provide a con or maybe an item i would see improvement , i would have to say that this camera is not your average point    n    shoot product  .
this is a professional camera with more customizations and settings than any competitor camera  .
with that , once the learning curve is transversed , the camera is the ultimate machine if you have the means , buy it  .
i am sure it will not disapoint we use it to snap the photo in a studio and wirelessly write the image to a server share , as the photos are taken , marketing production staff is grabbing the images , clipping and saving within our dam for further production this camera is the ultimate photo machine enjoy  .
the image quality is simply superb  .
don  .
t let the pixel count fool you  .
i printed 13x19  .
s that rival and even surpass the printouts from higher pixel count pro slr  .
dynamic range and colors are also excellent  .
i am not experiencing any of the auto focus problems that were apparently an issue with this model  .
in my experience , my 1d out performs even my nikon d3 in terms of auto    focus tracking especially in low light situations  .
i happen to shoot both the nikon and canon systems  .
i purchased the canon 85l f1/2 and recently completed a portrait session with this combination  .
the results were nothing short of amazing  .
incredibly sharp where needed with beautiful colors  .
i highly recommend this model but it is not a camera for the novice photographer  .
unfortunately , all the talk about the auto    focus issues has over    shadowed this truly amazing camera  .
once you mastered the technical aspects of the 1d mark 3 and combining your photography skills , providing that you have some , i guarantee that you will not be disappointed with the final printouts .
after owning the canon 1d mark2 , i decided to give the nikon d3 a try  .
it is a nice camera except for one huge problem it couldn't focus well in low/medium light so , i took back the d3 and got the 1d mark iii  .
best move i ever made  .
this camera focuses better in low light than the d3 and mark2 combined  .
the noise at high iso's is almost as good as the d3 (but what good is clean iso from the d3 if it cannot focus in low light)  .
additionally rob galbraith reviews this camera and states that the 1d mark iii produces the best images of any camaera at iso100    1600 , that includes the d3 and 1ds mark iii by far , the best indoor sports camera you can buy is the 1d mark iii  .
most of the people on here giving it low scores either do not own one , or had the old pre    blue dot cameras .
if you are thinking about this camera the old bodies did have an issue (i had one of them) i bought new another body a few weeks ago and bottom line it works  .
i did have to micro adjust some of my lens , but i had canon do for free since i spent so much money on body and lens .
the initial mirror problems are fixed  .
this is a superb camera if one takes the time to learn to set the af features to match the specific photography needs  .
i use ai servo , so i had to go through the af menu and set it up to my needs after customizing the af and always working in manual mode , the camera captures fantastic shots this is not a beginners' point and shoot camera  .
it is a pro camera that has to be fine tuned  .
if you fine tune it , you will be rewarded .
afer reading some of the negative reviews on this site , i'm wondering how many people have really used this camera extensively and really understand the auto    focus complexities  .
i have owned this camera since july 2007 , and have made over 6000 images with it since then , including over 3000 in warm weather in kenya in august , and well over 1000 recently in cold weather in bosque del apache in new mexico  .
the performance has been superb , all in all , considering the high demands i placed on it for photographing high speed chases (cheetahs) and high speed flight (birds flyng directly toward the camera for landing at close range)  .
canon released a service advisory for an auto focus problem due to a sub    mirror assembly problem in some (but not all) mark iii's , and my serial number is among those listed as probably having the problem  .
i is too busy to send it in for repair until after i returned from bosque , but i is very pleased with all the great images i brought back from africa as well as bosque  .
i recently purchased a canon 40d as well , and flight shots at bosque with both cameras showed a higher percentage of perfect focus with the mark iii than with the 40d  .
by the way , i finally sent the mark iii off for repair two weeks ago on a friday , and had it back in my hands the following friday , with an extended warranty of a year from the repair date (on the whole camera , not just the repair) there are custom functions that affect auto    focus performance on this camera that simply do not exist on other cameras , including the 40d , so that adds to complexity and the possiblity that the camera may not be set up optimally for the kind of shooting you are doing  .
however , once you have it set up properly , i believe you will be struck by some of the awesome images you can make  .
i know a number of professional photographers who are shooting with this camera almost exclusively , and i'll always choose it over the 40d for the most difficult shooting situations by the way , i have a leopard image from kenya made after sunset at iso 3200 , 1/60 second , that is virtually noiseless  .
my 40d at the same shooting conditions in bosque could not come close , with a fair amount of shadow noise present .
autofocus needs further adjustment by canon , it's predecessor , a 5d , produced much sharper images .
given the demonstrated issues with the 1d mark iii's autofocus , cnet should seriously reconsider its editors choice award and its 9  .
3 spectacular rating  .
such a rating is not merited for a camera that fails to accomplish its primary task competently (a sports camera that cannot focus in broad daylight  .
additionally , more and more people are moving up from compact digital cameras to digital slr's  .
given that technology from the 1 series will trickle down to the lower end canon slr's expected to be announced in near future , it is incumbent upon a review site such as cnet to put the camera through its paces to see if it lives up the manufacturer's promises  .
if the autofocus issue continues to occur in the expected 40d and 5d ii , many cnet users will be ripped off by canon  .

this camera is a top digital contender , even though its feel in the hands is quite amateurish  .
that said , the nikon d2xs will outshoot it every time  .
why  .
unacceptable banding in continuous tone gradations  .
i shot with this canon , and had to rely on the old prepress trick of adding noise to correct banding in smooth gradations to fix an ugly problem found in shots with a continuous color which grades from light to darker tones over a large portion of the image  .
the image is of a human , not some odd object which might mess with the sensor  .
the banding is prominent enough to make me yearn for kodachrome and a good drum scan the same sort of image shot on the competitive nikon d2xs does not display this issue  .
that's why i opted to buy the nikon  .
i'm waiting to test the d3x with its 25+ megapixels and full frame sensor like the canon , as i'm curious to know if the banding issue is a function of sensor size and overal pixel density .
updated  .
on oct 21 , 2008  .
the fact that canon has produced 10+ versions of firmware for their camera says something of the autofocus problem .
this has been a bitter disappointment for me , having left nikon 6 years ago ive been thrilled with the canon products , particularly the 1d series , it showed how a camera should work , nikon had nothing like it until the d3 coming from a long line of 1d , 1d firmware update , 2x 1d mkii and those firmware updates a to 2x mkiin i is not going to be so easily impressed but is looking forward to the better low light af , bringing it on par with nikon for the first time ever and the increasing the sensitivity to �2  .
8 again matching nikon and increasing low light sensitive to    1 to where nikon had been all along , this along with the improved servo af is finally a machine that truly had everything but if it cant focus , its sadly not worth the ink on the box  .
canon are recalling the camera from the dealers , but i as someone who paid top dollar will have to send it in , at my own expense , i cant even return it to my dealer , im so mad  .
this camera had great potential but auto focus issues make it hard to pay the bills with shots that are out of focus .
well as you know this camera has an awful auto focusing problem skip this , head for the excellent full fram nikon d3 enough said  .
probably canon's biggest blunder the past decade  .
great pro camera with a design flaw that misfocuses in warm weather    not good for a sports camera  .
on the up side you should be able to find one cheap on the used market if you live in cool climate  .
cnet should revise their rating .
given the demonstrated issues with the 1d mark iiis autofocus , cnet should seriously reconsider its editors choice award and its 9  .
3 spectacular rating  .
such a rating is not merited for a camera that fails to accomplish its primary task competently (a sports camera that cant focus in broad daylight  .

this camera is terrible  .
my worst one has been to canon factory repair 5 times  .
the thing just does not focus  .
i would not recommend purchasing a canon mkiii camera  .
i am actually surprised canon is not sued for making such a sub    par product  .
i shoot sports and news and need my equipment to operate properly , always .
firmware after firmware the autofocus does not work acurately  .
ask any canon professional photographer and they will tell you to stay away from this model  .
wake up cnet , what an embarrassment  .
the highest rated product of 2007 and it does not focus properly  .
cnet lacks integrity , reliability , and knowledge  .
i dont know why i bother with cnet .
if you are thinking about purchasing a 1d mark iii , 1ds mark iii , 40d , xti or the presumably soon to be announced 5d mark ii , you should think carefully about your decision  .
canon is having serious quality control issues with its newest camera  .
even worse , canon wont discuss the issue , cant fix it and appears to have been aware of it before releasing the product including tax , i paid close to $5 , 000 for the 1d mark iii  .
it soon became clear that i had made a huge mistake assuming canon would not sell a flagship camera with a crippled autofocus  .
if you research this issue you will learn about a photographer named rob galbraith who tested a pre production camera and described the autofocus as a mess  .
canon told him that the pre production autofocus had limitations and that the issues would be addressed before production  .
his extensive tests of production cameras , however , determined that canon had not improved the autofocus  .
here is his description of the auto focus    .
it cannot hold focus on static subjects very well and it cannot track moving subjects very well over the months , rob rigorously tested a total of 9 cameras and all 9 cameras were defective  .
after publicly ignoring the issue for 7 months , canon finally admitted that there is a hardware issue that needed to be repaired  .
canon , however , claimed that only a minority of cameras needed the repair , a claim that strongly contrasted with robs 9 out of 9 bad cameras with a wide range of serial numbers acquired over several months after the fix acknowledgement , canon began marking post fix cameras with a blue dot on the box of new cameras  .
rob tested the new cameras too  .
after rigorously testing 2 newly designed post fix cameras selected by canon japan and one additional camera with the fix , rob determined that the cameras were still broken  .
his tests where supervised by canon tokyo and canon usa and his lenses were calibrated by canon to rule out lens calibration issues  .
believe what you like , but it seems that if canon cant even find 2 good cameras , its unlikely you will find one i feel that canon has dealt with the issue dishonestly and although i previously loved its products , i am very open to switching brands  .
nikon has released several compelling bodies and lenses  .
if i switch , it will cost me dearly because i own lenses that cost me a several multiples of the cost of the mark iii , but i am seriously looking  .
good luck on your decision , youll need it if you choose canon by the way , you will find that people who use either brand are fiercely loyal and will criticize anyone who says anything negative  .
i could care less  .
i paid a premium for premium performance and i got a dud  .
it appears that they are all duds  .
i would be just as hard on an expensive flat screen , computer or car that could not perform its primary function competently  .
canon should be embarrassed by its abject failure to produce a quality product at this price point but it hasnt deigned to address the issue in any meaningful way see the latest tests by rob galbraith below  .
the latest installment includes 650 full resolution pictures and is 8 , 500 words    .
