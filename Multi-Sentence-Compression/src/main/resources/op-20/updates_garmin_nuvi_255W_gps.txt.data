_________________________ UPDATE__________________________
> Links up flawlessly to my Mac using Garmin RoadTrip, WebUpdates, etc .
The maps seem to be fairly updated .
,  Speed of map updates is awesome .
easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .
More often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .
The map update was about 2GB in size .
it's a curiousity for most of us, traffic and content updates   .
This clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .
update and reroute much _more_ quickly than my other GPS   .
,  No traffic update but don't really need it
Use the  Webupdater  so that the unit is running at its peak .
Otherwise you can't update the maps !
Getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .
Loading a map update is another experience I won't go into .
Then it said I needed to update some software I said OK .
We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .
I ran the updater and there was an upgrade for the software and text for Jack TTS and Samantha TTS .
MapSource also makes it easy to update your unit's map annually .
Glad I updated the map and software .
