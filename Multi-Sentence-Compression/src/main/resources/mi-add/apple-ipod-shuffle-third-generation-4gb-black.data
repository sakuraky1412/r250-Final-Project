all    in    all , this version of ipod shuffle rocks , for me , it's better than the newest one  .
simplicity at its best , they say i have this version of ipod , a 2gb green shuffle , and what really dislike the most is the clip  .
it's clip is much prone to scratches and i have to wipe it a billion times everyday just to remove the fingerprints  .
i made a solution to it and made it look like brushed    metal clip by rubbing or scrubbing the shiny side with scotchbrite it really is fashionable , it looked more techie than previous ones , and provides a better quality of audio over all , , i give a five    star rating to apple and the device itself .
if all you sports people thought that the older ipod shuffle is the cat�s whiskers then this will knock your socks off  .
so feather light and unobtrusive that you forget you are wearing it  .
and with enough storage to make using apple�s lossless music compression a reality at this size at $79 it�s a no brainer .
this is the coolest small mp3 player  .
period  .
i absolutely love the playlist feature  .
i've saved each individual album as a playlist and so i can scan through all my albums and choose which i want to listen to  .
this is my only complaint of the previous shuffles  .
i'm completely satisfied with this shuffle  .
i have an iphone so when i want more , that's what i'll use  .
otherwise , this little guy is my new best pal brett  .
do not knock it till you try it  .
voice recognition is fantastic and amazingly clear  .
cannot think of anything else other than the position of the clip that i would want to change i think this is a very good ipod for $79  .
apple got it right i have had ipods since the beginning from classic , nanos shuffles , and next to the current nano this little gem is my favorite .
great price , great design , great product  .
i do not regret buying it at all .
i ordered my new shuffle the day it came out and didn't even realize how much more convenient it is going to be until walking home last night  .
i always had to clip my 2 gen shuffle in a spot where i could reach the buttons , oriented in a manner where i knew which end is up and which control is volume versus forward/reverse  .
also , since i always clipped it on my pants pocket (that is the most user    freindly location for me in most situations) , if i wore a coat , it is always hard to get to the controls well not anymore  .
i just love that now i can clip (or not clip) my shuffle wherever i want and not need to worry about which way it's clipped (facing in , facing out) , what direction the controls are facing , and whether i can get to them  .
they're on the headphones  .
easy breezy i've had an iphone since day 1 and always loved the inline controls (just always wished they controlled volume)  .
so having all that in my ipod is great  .
honestly , i don't care about the voice feature  .
i do not have playlists and know the title and artist of every song i've downloaded    um , because i downloaded them now i'm just waiting for the scosche replacement earbuds to come out , just like i waited for the v    modas to come out i use on my iphone  .
i is never a fan of apple's earbuds updated  .
on mar 13 , 2009  .
i went for a swim in the sea with my shuffle  .
obviously it stopped working , but after i soaked it in fresh water (  .
) for an hour or two to desalt , it started functioning again perfectly  .
i have an 80 gig ipod that i would take to the gym and have strapped to my arm  .
i wore out the arm band and when going to get a new one i checked out the shuffle  .
i liked the size and the price is not bad for an apple product so i picked that up instead of getting a new arm band  .
it is money well spent  .
the 80 gig is large and bulky on my arm and i is always afraid of doing damage to it in the gym  .
the head phones were also always in the way when lifting weights  .
i had pulled the head phones out on some exercises  .
now with the shuffle i can clip it to my waist band on my shorts and run the cord under my shirt  .
the controls are easy to use once i got use to them  .
i just loaded it up with my work out play list and a few others for walking around  .
it is an entry level ipod but it does more than the previous generation  .
it tells you the song artist and title when you hold the center button and you can change between play lists  .
i am very happy with my purchase  .
i am not sure i would recommend for the first time ipod buyer  .
i use my 80 gig almost every day , but the shuffle is perfect for me to take to the gym updated  .
on jul 21 , 2009  .
the bottom line is that this is a great little mp3 player for people who want music while working out , running errands , or going to class/work  .
the only flaw is that you must use the apple headphones but to be honest for most people this wont be a issue  .
this is not targeted towards audiophiles who insist on top of the line headphones anyway  .
if you are looking for a small user friendly mp3 player then this is the one for you to address a few common complaints no screen   if you are in the market for an mp3 player to use while working out or running around town you wont be utilizing a screen anyway  .
besides , neither one of the original shuffles have had screens either so this is not anything new pricing   it is about $20 more then its competitors in the 4gb market style   its the sleekest player in its category battery life   if a 10 hour battery life is too short for a player of this type then you have very unrealistic expectations .
when i initially removed it from the case i could not believe how tiny it is  .
it is so tiny it can be lost in seconds but after syncing and listening i is really impressed with the sound because it is very tiny it may seem impractical to put the controls on the ear phones but i find it very convenient  .
with the prior generation shuffles i always had to remove the unit to see the controls and then reposition it  .
sometimes i would change accidentally change songs if i moved the wrong way  .
now i do not have to worry about any of this  .
now i can access the controls without relocating the shuffle there is a lot of griping and complaining about this model but i find its simplicity refreshing  .
everything is so complicated these days it's nice to be able to click and choose updated  .
on mar 17 , 2009  .
i gotta say i love how people review something they've never used  .
i used the headphone remote for the iphone for months , very intuitive and did everything this one does , but this one added volume controls  .
truth is , for all the complaints , none of these folks whining have actually tried the thing  .
i have , and i love it key points    .
you rarely skip backwards when using an mp3 player (be honest) so the most likely thing you'll do is double click anyway    beyond that you probably just play and pause which is one click away    ten dollar adapter cables are coming out to let you use your old phones , but really , this is an entry level pod , so those with it will probably be just fine with the included set    the controls are closer to your face , and easier to find in a run    less seams to collect dirt and grime , sweat and other garbage    support for multiple playlists is very nice , now that we have 4gb to play with .
nice mp3 player for under $100 , even including the control adapter  .
i mainly bought this to listen to music and audiobooks , so i would not have to use my ipod touch , which is heavy , takes up a lot of room , and (after two years of use) is a little short in the battery department  .
it fulfills the job with distinction  .
i'm afraid nothing can beat the touch for sheer ease of use , but the voice    over system works well enough for me  .
4gbs of storage is enough for all my music , plus a couple of audiobooks  .
the battery will run for several days without needing a recharge  .
the sound quality produced sounds great to me  .
anyway , great product if you want a music only device  .
highly recommend .
i like this product because you can clip it on your clothes and it ; s very cool  .
i dont like that the buttons are on the cable .
i did a lot of research before finally picking this little fella for my workout player  .
i is worried about some of the reviews , but took the plunge anyway  .
i is looking forward to my first high intensity workout and is not dissappointed  .
the headphones did not cut out , nor did the volume jack up , or down  .
the player didn't stop , or advance to the next track  .
granted it is only my first workout , but after a 5 mile run , and buckets of sweat , my music continued on , uninterrupted i clipped the player to the back of my ball cap , and as the cnet review mentions , this is the closest thing to an invisible player as it comes  .
the cord is out of my way , and didn't tangle up here in the northland , lots of times my player is buried under layers of clothes , many times inaccessible while riding on a crowded bus  .
making it virtually impossible to advance to the next track , or adjust volume levels  .
the controls on the headphone cable seem to be on the right track , but i do not like the apple headphones  .
i'm looking forward to getting the headphone adapter to use my more comfortable headphones with this little rascal  .
yep , it's a bit more of an expense but , heck , we spend 30 bucks for cases , headphones , accessories for our main ipods  .
this is a non    issue the only con is it's extreme smallness  .
when not in use , i'll stash it in a sunglasses case to be sure it's in a safe place flame away  .

if you add in the belkin headphone adapter i bought , i give this new shuffle 5 stars  .
i've never been able to use any of apple's ear bud headphones  .
when i first bought this shuffle , i loved it , but had to return it because i couldn't wear the headphones except with my budfits clips  .
but using those moved the shuffle controls up to 1 inch from my ear  .
which i just hated  .
so i returned the shuffle i considered replacing it with a different non    ipod player , but i want to own players that will work well with itunes  .
so i ended up with a 2nd gen shuffle  .
but i hated the controls  .
after a little practice , i could use the controls by touch only  .
but while sitting or running , i always had to unclip the 2nd gen to actually use the controls  .
it was not a huge , huge deal to do this , and maybe i'm just an uncoordinated neanderthal  .
but i just is never very happy with the 2nd gen  .
no playlists it just is disappointing back to the new shuffle   i don't know why i never noticed the belkin headphone adapter before , but once i did , i is so thrilled because i knew now i could use the shuffle with my own headphones  .
and i like that with the adapter , my controls are now down the headphone wire closer to the player itself , but not on the actual player  .
nor is the control way up near my face , which maybe i'm weird for hating so much  .
i don't have any problems with sweat messing up the belkin's controls maybe i'm really weird for liking this part       while exercising , i can clip it to my sports support top (i'm female) and control the music without having to feel myself up  .
i'm sorry if it sounds crazy , but to me this is really , really cool  .
(i guess it might take a while to see if that makes the metal clip eventually rust  .
i think the new controls are really cool  .
maybe i'll tire of them , but i don't have any problems skipping back and forth or fastforwarding and rewinding  .
it works great  .
i admit i think i'll try to cut down on the number of playlists i sync , because it is kind of annoying to skip through a list of 20 playlists to get to the one i want the sound quality sounds to me just like any other mp3 player i've owned  .
(but i've never had high expectations for quality from an mp3 player and portable headphones , so i don't even bother trying  .
you have to use isolating headphones to get good quality from headphones , and that's just completely dangerous if you're doing anything except sitting still alone in a room , in my opinion  .
if i'm listening to something that requires precise sound , i personally listen to completely uncompressed files with surround sound speakers or studio headphones  .
in summary , this player (like every single other player on the market) is great for some people and won't work at all for some others  .
lots of people will be really happy using it  .
if you want something uber    portable , and the lack of a screen does not scare you away , i recommend trying out this player .
i love this player , my parents told me i is nuts for buying a third ipod , i did not care and bought it anyway  .
best 84 dollars spent of my life (i bought it at apple and with tax it comes down to 84 something) i have the black one and i must say just like the macbook it's a fashion icon  .
all i can say nis get this thing todaybeacause if you already like apple products theres basically no reason not to get it .
the bottom line with this ipod is if you only want to listen to music and have something small and light then this is for you  .
i bought this because i is looking for exactly that and my expectations where met and more some  .
the voice over is really cool and tells you the name of the artist and song you are listening you  .
plus having the 4gb is a great thing to have as well .
needed an mp3 player to be ultra    small so the i could place it anywhere during vigorous exercise  .
this shuffle is splendid for that but if the ultra    smaill profile is not necessary for you there are many easier    to    use mp3 players out there at better price points .
its small easy to use  .
interface on headphones is ok but want the adapter  .
good for students and young kids .
this is a great little mp3 player  .
the design is so sleek and i find myself looking at it and saying , wow  .
the size is very nice , and it makes it feel like your headphones are hanging in the air , playing music from nothing  .
i definitely wouldn't recommend this as a first mp3 player , or even a main one  .
it's great as a secondary , like to take to school , running , or somewhere you want music but don't want to put your more important mp3 player in danger  .
the apple headphones aren't as bad as i thought they would be  .
i have a pair of skullcandy , and i figured the difference would be night and day  .
the apple pair just sound like they need bass and they're a little quiet  .
so if you want a secondary mp3 player and do not mind the apple earbuds , go pick this up .
i love this shuffle i think it looks way better than the last gen , i use for running and going to the gym , thats the only reason i got this  .
i got tired of looking like a   with my touch strapped to my arm .
this product is great for what it is    a small , user    friendly , elegant ipod that you can clip to your shirt and exercise with and not even know its there  .
is it a full    time replacement for an ipod touch or classic ipod  .
of course not  .
is it a great device to use while on the go    yes .
not sure where the editors were thinking when they reviewed this little beauty  .
it's the low end price point in the ipod line , great for the gym , running , biking , hiking , etc  .
if 8 to 10 hours of battery life is not enough out of a unit this size then someone has unreasonable expectations  .
control functions are straightforward and easy to use  .
it's not a $300 unit it's $79 holds about 1 , 000 songs and is great for on the go , active lifestyles that they can use with minimal weight and interference .
this is for the black 2gb version , there doesn't seem to be a listing for it  .
but other than capacity , they should be identical in all other areas , right  .
i was not ever going to get the 3rd gen  .
shuffle due to the fact that i don't like the fact that you have to buy an additional adapter to use decent earphones  .
but i needed a small mp3 player to tide me over since my nice big one with a screen needs to be sent in for repair i tried the sansa clip+ , very good as the reviews say but it just didn't appeal to me like it should have  .
tried a sony player , one of the new cheaper s line  .
also good , except screen is scratch prone and loud beep interference with my cell phone occured  .
i usually carry my players in my purse , you see i finally took a look at the shuffle and since i is able to get a discount at best buy , i figured why not , cannot hurt  .
it's a keeper over the other 2 let me say that the other 2 players do indeed win on sound quality , but with a good pair of earphones , the shuffle is fine for walking down the street or on the bus  .
i don't always need concert quality outside because i also have to keep alert to what's around me  .
unlike others , i didn't try this for working out because the sweat problems are well documented  .
but you can still use the player to add a couple playlists for your errands or commute  .
since it's small , it easily clips onto a pocket inside my purse with little interference with other items in my purse  .
the voice over is a cool feature that comes in handy when switching playlists or finding tracks  .
i'm happier than i thought i'd be with the 3rd gen  .
shuffle and that shocked me , lol  .
but needing to get an extra adapter just to use your own earphones  .
that's still my biggest pet peeve  .
why couldn't they just include one at the prices they charge  .
or better yet , just add buttons back on the next shuffle (although they'd likely have to increase the size again) price is another pet peeve  .
i didn't get the 4gb although i probably should have , but the price plus the extra adapter rubbed me the wrong way  .
i settled for the 2gb because of the extra cost of the adapter  .
honestly the other 2 players were much better deals for the money  .
they just didn't click with me  .
but if you're looking for a good value , the shuffle honestly is not it  .
it is just the only player that i actually liked right away and did not consider returning , but that may not be the same for you  .
even with the discount i got , the 2gb is at least $10 too much imo  .
and when you have 8gb players , or players with more features for the same price range as the 4gb shuffle , you really have to ask yourself if you want to pay for less another problem , the voice over really needs to be retweaked to pronounce the names of popular artists properly at the very least  .
many are mispronounced and it just sounds weird  .
also it's a bit too robotic sounding  .
but other than that , it's pretty cool for navigation this is just my review , do what's best for you  .
i know many are unhappy about the adapter and rank it very low due to that  .
i did too before i tried it , but once you deal with that , it's not too bad afterall  .
yes it bites paying even more , but using your own headphones is a must  .
i'm not sure it would have received the mark i gave it if i used the included earphones because the last time i used ipod buds , they were lacking  .
and since i didn't use them for working out , that may also factor into the higher number , but i really do not need shorted out buds  .
so just consider this a review for street use only , lol  .
i got this as a secondary ipod for my son to use on the train to and from school while at lunch  .
the reason that i wanted one easy to hide is that there is a relatively high risk of ipods being snatched from students while on the crowded buses trains this one is less expensive than his touch and easy to slip into his jacket pocket without leaving a bulge  .
i just wish the headphone cord was not white since that's a dead give away that you're listening to an ipod  .
for what is it it does what we want it to do , syncs all of his music and keeps the play lists straight  .
i have only 2 major complaints  .
1) the enclosed usb power cord is too short  .
since his computer is not on most of the time he wants to charge it on his bedside table as he does with his touch and , while the usb cable can be used with the wall adapter it's too short unless you put the adapter on an extension cord  .
apple will sell you a longer cord but i feel that they should have supplied both or just the longer one with the original unit  .
i'm guessing that griffin technology or some other company will make a dock adapter for this new shuffle similar to the ones for the 2nd gen shuffle but we'll have to wait for that 2) the proprietary headset , my son does not like the regular apple ear buds but now will have to use them with this unit until adapters are available which will let him use his regular headphones updated  .
on mar 24 , 2009  .
i have owned the previous 2 generations of the shuffle , which i listen to in a noisy work environment by substituting etymotic canal phones  .
if i understand the review correctly , the new shuffle will limit you to the provided ear buds  .
definitely a no go for me .
so good , yet so bad because it's so inexpensive ($59 in most retail outlets) i'd recommend getting the $29  .
95 adapter  .
(hopefully some generic equivalent will soon be on the market for less)  .
it's a shame it has to be this way , but what can you say  .
i'm not one to make impulse buys , but i did with this one , not having read any reviews for it before purchasing this thing  .
i did not know they had changed the design like this  .
when i got it home and opened it up , i noticed no buttons on the shuffle itself  .
then , i noticed a plus/minus thingy on the headphones  .
were those the controls  .
yeah , they were  .
weird i thought , but ok  .
i took it to the gym to try it out  .
first time i went everything worked fine  .
i was not happy about the earbud controls , but hey they worked  .
then i went to the gym a second time  .
fail about midway through the workout , the right earbud stopped working after i began to sweat  .
i dried it off and it began to work again , only to short out once i started sweating conclusion   buy this only if you plan on not working up a sweat  .
i think many people will wind up having to buy third    party buds to get any real functionality out of it .
the ipod came in a very appealing box , but looked very simple  .
it is considerably smaller than i thought it would be after adding music and making my playlists , i decided to try it out to see how the controls work ; and it is more complicated than i thought  .
double and triple    clicking , holding for one or three seconds it all took some time to get used to when i noticed a problem , however , i is at the gym  .
even though we know that the ipod is not waterproof , it should be assumed that people sweat while exercising  .
i had never had a problem using previous ipods or earphones while exercising but , with the controls on the earphones on this one , it is a different story   the ipod started repeating the song title , and listing all of my playlists and even adjusting the volume on its own  .
this is all caused by sweat getting into the control unit  .
after allowing it to dry out , i tried it again and the ipod worked perfectly  .
when i took it out for a jog later , the ipod malfunctioned once again i looked up this problem on the internet and found that many others have had the same issues with the ipod's waterproof    ness  .
other than that , the ipod works great and can be clipped pretty much anywhere  .
because of this , please be careful to not let it go in the wash by accident in conclusion   though the ipod is likely designed for exercise enthusiasts , the humidity issue turned out to be a problem that could be quite frustrating  .
if you are looking for a media player to listen to through your car or home stereo , please select one of the other models with more intuitive controls (and also because you cannot control what you're listening to if you do not have the earphones provided , or other third    party earphones with the control unit)  .
however , if you like the previous generation shuffles , you will find the features on this one very enjoyable for leisure listening .
this is a glimpse of the future  .
it represents a step towards something even better , so can only be seen a part of the transition towards the future , not the final outcome .
i bought one for $55 and i tried to put music on it like 7 differant times and every time it said sync complete ok to disconnect ye when i disconnected it and unplugged it every time it said please , use itunes to sync the ipoop in the sync  .
apple is trying too hard with this shuffle re    release , having the controls all on the head phones is absurd  .
the voice thing is very inginuitive but i would rather get that on the previous shuffle  .
i listed size as a con because the shuffle is already as small as it could possibly be before the benefits start decreasing , becomming pointlessly small  .
just like in economics their is a point of maximum efficiency , nothing less , nothing more i am not an apple hate , as i just went out and got a 16 gig nano 4 hours ago  .
i got it for jogging instead of the new shuffle because of the absurdity in design people do not need to own this product , its an i pod .
no , i have not used it , but there is no other place to make comments to the review most specifically , the reviewer states at one point , the ipod shuffle's slim design and all    metal construction make the sandisk sansa clip (left) look like a beast , but the ipod's elegance comes with some sacrifice  .
come now  .
yep , the sandisk sansa clip certainly is a beast , only slightly larger than last week's shuffle and in a cute    appearing form factor , offering a small oled screen providing all the info  .
you need , an fm radio , a recorder , an equalizer , a sleep timer , ogg vorbis and flac capability , multiple bookmark capability , 15    hour battery life , etc  .
, etc  .
, that in the end is a full    featured audio player shrunk down to matchbook size oh , and currently on sale at u  .
wal    mart b m's at $49 for 8 gb's of storage       in other words , twice as much storage as the new shuffle for just a bit over half the cost yep , the clip is a beast all right (by the way , humorous that cnet rates the clip at 3    1/2 stars , and then somehow finds a way to give the new shuffle 3 )  .
i am a pretty serious runner and find music motivating , particularly for speed workouts  .
i often want to flip through my music to find a song that is the right tempo for my pace at a given moment  .
i find it almost impossible to double and triple click when i'm running faster than a 7    minute mile  .
the control also stops working with any moisture       a light rain or heavy sweat will at least temporarily fry it  .
the battery doesn't last as long as the last version , and the clip is not as secure       it wo not stay on the waistband of my shorts  .
the clip is also sharp       it digs into my skin and has drawn blood on long runs  .
i wish apple would bring back the last version , which i loved .
would not advise purchasing unless the headset design is improved  .
the qa for this product is obviously limited and did not include ppl who actually sweat when they workout  .
apple should be ashamed for not testing more thoroughly .
i work at target and i only recommend this product for people who have there life on the itunes store  .
i would more consider this product for me or the guests that come to the target if they did not have to purchase an additional adapter so they can use their headphones  .
the mane compeditors of this product are about $25    30 cheaper , have a screen , fm radio , majority with a voice recorder , some with color screens , some with expansible memory  .
all you are paying for is the apple brand the ability to use the songs off the itunes store that cant be used with anything ells  .
all that is not including the ones that are in the same price range .
i do not like the fact that i have to create a playlist with the exact or less than 3  .
77 gb to sync ipod  .
generation 1 and 2 would update songs and sync from any size playlist  .
this is one of the features that set the ipod shuffle above other mp3 players  .
now you have to replace each song manually more like a primitive mp3 player .
i still have the 1st generation ipod suffle (512 mb) and i love it  .
i is thinking of buying this one but decided otherwise when i realized the cotrols were on the earphones' cord what  .
if you lose your earphones , you are screwed until you get a new pair from apple  .
way to go apple  .
the device is practically unusable if you want to plug it in your music system or car stereo  .
a good design is not to make the device smaller and smaller but to make it usable  .
you can remove all the control you want from the unit and make it even smaller .
gen 1 2 shuffle far better ; they keep making the shuffle smaller but worse with each iteration  .
were consumers demaining an even smaller shuffle  .
i must have missed that one  .
becuase the result is a shuffle with the controls in the earphones       not good for the running community  .
ok , so i is new to the apple mp3 player scene  .
but not knowing that , using itunes for the first time , i moved music onto my shuffle like you do with all other mp3 players  .
now that i need to replace it because it didn't last over 2 months , i have to re    select all the individual songs that it took me more than half a day to do  .
this is because i moved songs straight to the ipod rather than create a playlist first ; a simple mistake with serious consequences and no recommendation in any manual that you should do that first  .
seems like an easy programming trick for the guys at apple to allow a playlist to be copied from an ipod to itunes  .
guess that's a little too difficult for them (i called them and asked an expert ) you may be wondering why it didn't last more than 2 months  .
well , first mistake , i ran with the shuffle  .
it apparently is not designed for this  .
the first run i is on , sweat got into the controller on the earphone wire , rendering it useless  .
they gave me a new one at the apple store since it is only 1 day from date of purchase  .
then it crapped out 2 runs later  .
i decided to try out one of the 3rd party controllers that you can use with any headphone  .
everything went well for several runs  .
enough to get me through about 2 months , then it started crapping out again  .
i thought it is the earphones again , so i bought another controller , but it didn't solve the problem  .
as it turns out , sweat got into the ipod and rendered it useless  .
now , since it is water damage it doesn't fall under the warranty and as a result , i have to pay $49  .
99 as the trade in price for a new one  .
i decided to cut my losses now before having to take out a second mortgage on my house to keep me in tunes during a run i am switching back to a pc based mp3 player since it is much easier to use (you don't have to have your music library converted to itunes format) , does not have the controller susceptibility and can be used during a run .
it is very disappointing that you cannot plug in other earphones , since that would prevent track change/skipping and volume adjustment  .
the earphones that come with ipod are of medium quality  .
i always use higher quality earphones and i cannot do so with this device  .
i regret i bought it  .
i am staying with my old mp3 players  .
bottom line    it's a great idea , but i is really surpised at how poorly designed the volume feature was  .
in my experience , it worked for 1 week  .
after a week , about 10 minutes into every run the volume would increase to max and then the device would turn off  .
it would start working again 1    2 hours later , once i is done with my run and the controls had dried off  .
given the placement of the volume control at the neckline , it's really unavoidable to have it hit any moisture if you're doing any sort of physical activity (and not wearing a turtleneck)  .
i returned it within 3 weeks and went back to the faithful ipod shuffle 2g .
this is a cool design concept from apple but it should have stayed a design  .
it is not an intelligent product  .
physically it is easily lost and it skimps out on the size to appeal to its size  .
the fact that apple has attempted to justify this design with their headphones is laughable  .
in one foul    swoop they have tried to force you to buy their accessories while justifying this absurd idea all in all if invisibility gets you excited than this may be for you , but the sansa clip sells for much less and actually gives you controls and a screen as well .
see cons  .
the previous shuffle is great  .
much more user friendly  .
take the controls off the head phones  .
fix issues with battery and controls sticking  .
hate it .
this is a terribly designed device with a series design flaw (headphones)  .
no other headphones will work with this ipod  .
these headphones will cease working from between 48hr to 2 weeks making your ipod useless  .
if you do any form of exercise/movement with the headphones they will quickly cease working and you wil have to fork our $$ to buy another set of equally defective headphones  .
i've returned one ipod and 3 sets of head phones in 1 month and give up  .
this is a terrible product .
the size of the shuffle is great for anyone who works out or wants a non    intrusive mp3 player  .
further , the shuffle doesn't try to do too many things    it is just a very compact mp3 player with a basic set of functionality  .
however , i've had nothing but problems with the latest version of the shuffle  .
i am on now on my 3rd third generation shuffle in less than 6 months (my 1st generation crapped out after less than 2 years)  .
quality control seems to be a problem at apple    i know of several friends with similar experiences  .
additionally , i hate the need for proprietary headphones  .
this might not be bad if apple gave you a decent set of headphones with the product , but they do not  .
i have a great set of shure headphones that i cannot use with the new shuffle  .
while the smaller size is great , i would rather have the previous version (which is more than small enough)  .
sure wish sansa or someone would develop a tiny player to compete wtih the shuffle because i'd be first in line .
the basic purpose of something like the shuffle 3rd gen is for people who want music while they do something active  .
most people doing something active sweat  .
clearly apple did not field test the headphone functionality as this is a very common problem (read the apple support forums)  .
this thing has cost me 3x what i paid for it in time    time on the phone with apple , time waiting for fed ex to deliver replacement headphones (apple makes you sign for everything  .
it's really a nightmare  .
and just so you know , i'm a big fan of apple    mbp , iphone 2g , iphone3gs , magic mouse , time capsule 500gb , ipod nano 8gb    so i'm not a basher , this is just a terrible product  .
i hope this helps  .
the new model is longer and thinner than the old one but i cannot honestly say this has resulted in any ergonomic or cosmetic improvements  .
it's just different the only significant technical difference is that the controls for play/pause/skip are mounted inline on the cable near the right earphone  .
there are two obvious and major drawbacks to this    .
you need to use special apple earphones  .
you cannot use your own which might provide better quality sound and might be cheaper to replace when they break    you cannot connect the device to a stereo or docking station using a simple audio cable avoid this product  .
a huge step backwards  .
i usually love apple products (own 8 macs , 9 ipods and love the software    with the exception of the new dumbed down imovie , which is garbage) , but this new shuffle design is awful and the worst product since the cube    very user unfriendly and i stopped using it since the lousy earbud design that comes with the shuffle will not stay in the ear (true of all of apple's cheap earbuds that come with ipods    i buy better ones that will stay in the ear)  .
an upgraded earbud with cord control is available    for the same price as the shuffle itself (a way to increase sales , by giving junk earbuds that force an upgrade  .
) , but i refuse to do this  .
apple really stubbed their toe on this one  .
like the newer versions of imovie , someone is allowing the once high quality control to slip  .
this is very unsettling , but the new macs i own seem the best ever made .
if i had known there is no rewind or ff i would have waited to buy a gen2 version  .
seems silly not to include it  .
some podcasts i listen to are four hours long  .
that means i have to listen to everything including commercials  .
also there is no way to ff to your former spot if you mess up  .
i really do not like this ipod .
i would not recommend the 3rd generation shuffle until apple fixes the moisture problem  .
you can see from their support discussion forum this is a fairly widespread issue .
i am on my second shuffle in less than a month  .
the headphones on the first shuffle did not work correctly all of the time  .
i took it back and got a second shuffle thinking that the problem is an isolated event  .
boy  .
is i wrong  .
the second shuffle is just as independable as the first  .
the headphone controls do not work consistently  .
i will never purchase another ipod shuffle again  .
it is been very disappointing  .
i also subscribed to itunes and purchased 150 songs that i cannot enjoy on my new ipod 3rd generation shuflle .
excellent device for the 'around town' user but not for those wanting to exercise , which sadly is one of the target user groups  .
customer care seems very uninformed about how to handle this situation ; replacement buds are continually sent out to customers with statements like 'that issue has been corrected' or 'it is a bad batch of ear buds' but from apple's own forum you can hunders (if not thousands) of buyers of this product still complaining of this issue .
bought one , ear bud controls malfunctioned while i is running , couldnt skip songs or adjust volume  .
i've read that they have problems when you prespire  .
exchanged unit , same problem  .
then it just stopped working  .
returning unit    going back to 2nd generation shuffle .
it starts out as great    but i'm having a problem    is it perpiration  .
is it just movement  .
i do not know    but i got this to wear at the gym as sometimes my iphone is too much to carry and loved the size convenience  .
so i brought it and added my playlist    it is great for the first 2 days and then as i is wokring out    the volume spiked on its own and i was not able to control it on the headphones  .
the controls just died  .
so    i took it back and apple retunred it no problem and just gave me a new one  .
so i have this new one and again    on the 2nd day    it does the same thing  .
this must be malfunction of the product itself  .
does it not take body heat well  .
perpsiration  .
that's all i can think of does anyone else know  .
if you are purchasing this for exercise and you sweat at all , beware  .
the control seems to be very sensitive to moisture and i would not recommend for this purpose .
apple should create a control connector that allows ipod users to replace the headphones and submit any type of software to increase the sound a bit  .
if your sat on a bus or train then this just might be a good unit , its compact size is great for travel , if how ever you use it for any form of sporting activity look else were .
i would not buy this again until it comes with better headphones  .
i am very disappointed .
product is cool looking no doubt    but i feel it will not do well .
apple has really screwed up the shuffle design  .
instead of improving a winner with more memory and a tiny display , they choose to introduce a poorly conceived new design  .
frankly , i's stunned at how quickly apple has lost it way now that steve job's is no longer running the show .
if you buy this you have no brain  .
its over priced and cannot do squat voice and playlist feature is useless  .
cannot fast forward or rewind  .
$40 for 4 gigs is a rip off    you can get a sandisk sansa clip for $60 and 4 gigs has a screen to easily find your music files  .
if you are honestly considering buying this p  .
then instead you should buy a case of beer  .
at least that makes women hotter and can make you life funner ,  .
not to mention cheaper  .
ok im done never buy a ipod shuffle  .
there a big waste of money  .
i wish cnet had the balls to give this mp3 player a one or two star rating , cause thats all it deserves and they know it  .
one of their other articles call it terrible but they still give it a good rating  .
you can get a sansa clip 4gb for $50 thst blows this thing away in every way possible .
totally uninspiring design looks like a chicklet  .
apple is a leader in coolness and this is just a plain disappointment .
what really upsets me is that apple stopped making the 2nd generation model (have you seen how much it costs now in amazon  .
com  .
this is a very , very dumb decision by apple  .
do not buy the 3rd generation ipod shuffle  .
just wait for the next ipod shuffle generation (i do hope it will be based on the second generation design    the good one   hey steve , fire the dumbs who design this shuffle) or buy a fake chinese 2nd generation one (it is better than the original new shuffle  .
i really hate this product  .
i'm an avid runner and bought this only because my trusted rio cali is no longer compatible with itunes  .
the headphone cord is too short for my 6'2 frame so i have to run it inside the front of my shirt rather than drape it over my shoulder as i prefer  .
god help you if you lose/damage the headphones because all controls are built inline  .
all you can do on the body of this device is turn it off and on  .
song selection is an annoying , cumbersome voice prompt  .
i is hoping to swap out the headphones for some with ear loops or a band but that's not an option  .
the earbuds start slipping out as soon as the sweat hits them  .
i spend more time reinserting them than i do focusing on the task at hand    exercising  .
i am giving this piece of garbage to my 7 year old daughter and immediately shopping for a more practical mp3 player for my active lifestyle  .
highly , highly recommend against this product if you intend to use it for anything other than laying in a hammock watching the clouds pass by  .
like many other reviewers , i owned a 2nd generation shuffle , which i wore running  .
i never worried about it getting wet in the rain , and it never disappointed me  .
eventually i lost the shuffle , and bought the 3rd generation replacement  .
after about 4 months it stopped working  .
i followed the troubleshooting steps on the ipod web site , and eventually called tech support during the first call the agent had difficulty with his computer while trying to arrange for service  .
he had to call me back , and continued to have trouble and told me to call back in about 3 hours when i called back and explained this to the second agent he told me he would have to put a $75 hold on my credit card  .
i is unhappy about this since i only paid $55 for the ipod  .
then the agent asked me to look inside the 3  .
5mm jack with a flashlight and tell him what color i saw  .
when i told him it looked half white and half orange , he told me there is water damage which would not be covered by the warranty  .
he said i could take the ipod to a retail location to confirm this it did rain on my last run with the ipod , but i'm disappointed that a little rain would damage a device that appears to be designed for athletic use .
recently purchased the 3rd generation ipod shuffle (not a serial number included in the replacement program)  .
i have not been able to get through one workout with this product without it failing due to moisture  .
i bought this shuffle to replace a nano that never failed during a workout but required the use of an armband  .
there is clearly something wrong with this product as this is the first ipod , walkman , rio , portable cd player i've ever had that failed during a workout  .
i is drawn to the small size and i assume most others also purchased this product for exercising  .
i have also tried both the belkin adaptor ($20) and the iluv adaptor ($10) and both failed during the first workout as well usually about 30 minutes before it flakes out  .
do not buy this product if you intend to use it exercise with  .
this is a lemon and should be avoided .
i dislike the new , generation 3 shuffle  .
the buttons are on the headphone wire  .
i can not use the headphones that come with the ipod as they fall out and hurt my ears  .
therefore , i am now forced to buy headphones that are more expensive than the shuffle is just to use the device  .
the 2nd generation shuffle is more convenient , however , mine is stolen .
initially the headphones volume/song changer constantly skip songs or changes volumes whenever you are moving with it on  .
eventually , after about a week , the headphones die with the slightest humidity  .
then you learn the good news that the price of the headphones are 2/3 the price of the entire unit when you first purchased it  .
what a horrible product and apple should be ashamed .
worst product ever produced by apple  .
will break if used at the gym or near moisture  .
stay away .
why apple designs an ipod like this is beyond me  .
so i recently ran a half    marathon and saw a 2g shuffle and talked to the gal who had it and she had it for years and said it is a great exercise companion  .
i have a ipod classic and it is too bulky to run with    so i figured i would get a shuffle  .
wow    what a horrible user experience  .
the fact that all of my controls are on my earbuds and each time i reach for them they fall out of my ears is enough to make you crazy  .
then every 45 seconds or so i have to push the right earbud back in my ear    constantly  .
running should be relaxing    this makes it very stressful  .
not to mention all of the reviews i have read about the controls malfunctioning due to perspiration seriously who let this out of the basement at apple  .
back to the store you go ipod  .
do they still sell 2g shuffle's  .
major step back    cannot use it in car or boat  .
bad design  .
i asked best buy salesperson if i is correct , that it is unusable in my car and boats as the controls are on the earbud wire  .
best buys said i is correct  .
the old design had the controls on the unit and i am still using it in my car and on my boats .
the worst ipod yet  .
having to use the apple earbuds is awful  .
they do not fit my ears well (never have) and you cannot switch mid    song these are not flaws , they're deal    breakers  .
what good is the high storage when you cannot switch songs  .
reverting to the apple of 'old' , you can only use apple stuff with this ipod and if you want something aftermarket for something as simple as headphones you have to buy something completely separate  .
forget the fact that the controls are so close to the ear that if you want to change the volume or pause the song (that's all you can control aside from the shuffle or repeat setting) that the crappy earbuds fall out of your ears forget working out with this shuffle , it's not going to happen i'm going to try and sell this x    mas gift for whatever i can get and this experience has me wanting to buy something non    apple to replace my dead ipod nano (due to its 10    minute non    replacable battery life now) updated  .
on jan 7 , 2010  .
i bought the ipod for the primary purpose of being my running companion  .
its compact design and clip on the back made it seem like the perfect choice  .
but the navigation buttons placed on headphones turned out to be a pain  .
the stock apple headphones that came with the device continuously fell out of my ears throughout my run  .
because you need the apple remote to control the ipod , i cannot simply replace the stock head phones with a pair that is designed to stay in your ear during a run without buying an adapter with a remote on it , or buying an expensive pair of headphones  .
it seems that while designing this , apple sacrificed user friendlyness for improved technology  .
i'm am usually a big apple fanboy , owning almost every product off their line , but i am highly unsatisfied with this ipod and wish that apple would go back to the old modle  .
apple really dropped the ball with this one .
malfunctions right in the middle of my workout which is the only reason i bought an ipod  .
i wasnt sure if it is just a short in the earphone or sweat running down the wire however , after some of the other reviews sweat seems to make alot of sense  .
volume will mute out , it will continue to ask which playlist to use even after i made my selection and a played a few songs  .
how annoying apple  .
i is really disappointed after using this shuffle  .
i assumed it would be better than the last one which is why bought it  .
instead it has been a headache ever since  .
i have never written a review about anything before but felt compelled because i hate this shuffle so much  .
for starters the skinny length pinches your skin while you move  .
the earphones are not comfortable , nor do they stay in  .
i am a big runner and have issues with finding the change button along my neck while running  .
i also have experienced volume control issues  .
i am so disappointed in this shuffle  .
i am going back to the older and much better one  .
the latter one i can choose my own ear phones and do not need to hear the next song  .
i can control that while i download my playlist before my runs .
if they would just come out and admit the phones are defective and come out with an improved version , i would say that the 3g sfuffle is a home run  .
but they continue to be stubborn on the headphone issue that 30 , 000 users have posted online about  .
the belkin adapter fixes the problem by letting you use other headphones , but its frustrating to have to pay $19  .
99 for a third party adapter just to use the shuffle updated  .
on oct 11 , 2009  .
i had this product (3rd gen shuffle) for one week  .
i went on a run and it stopped working in the middle of it  .
i took it to the apple store and they exchanged it  .
so when i got the new one it did the same exact thing , except this time they said i cannot get a replacement even though it is still under warranty  .
they advertised this product to be a work out aid  .
if it cannot handle that i would like to know it is meant to be used while sitting on your butt .
either get the 1mb or the nano skip this model .
run as fast as you can to get an old ipod shuffle this 3rd generation ipod is poorly thought out for active users .
third ipod failure in less than a year  .
nano , shuffle 2nd gen and now shuffle 3rd gen  .
and pathetic customer support  .
i will never own another apple product  .
buys zune , creative labs or anything else you'll pay less and be happier .
do not buy wait do buy mine , so i get some value back  .
anyways this is the weakes ipod so far .
this is designed for people who do not perspire or who live in a zero gravity environment  .
if you happen to perspire , even a little , you will find the perspiration , pulled by gravity flows into the little , non    waterproof , volume control and surprisingly , the perspiration mixing with the copper in the control , causes the control to cease functioning this is utter rubbish , poorly thought out , and simply a way of causing consumers to part with their money with little or no thought given to the quality f the product  .
steve jobs is clearly ill and no longer assessing the quality of the products  .
this is shameless profiteering  .
this is a memory stick with a control  .
the quality is very poor  .
the sound is fine but do not attempt to rely on that control    it has a lifespan of about one week  .
do not use whilst exercising    it will die very quickly  .
utter rubbish and a great disappointment  .
its a great that the shuffle is really tiny , but cannot use 3rd party headphones really got me disappointed .
i lust after the iphone and think the nano is an excellent product and value  .
however , cnet should get some cajones and really rate it like they see it  .
overpriced , more difficult to use , and very proprietary  .
a step backwards by apple at best .
this is the worst ipod design i have ever seen  .
i think that the coby mp    c7092 is better than this  .
(i do not recommend buying either of them)  .
you cannot connect it to a car because there is not a way to control the music  .
for $20 more you can get a 4gb zune with a screen , wifi , radio , games , touch pad , buttons , better sound quality , etc  .
if you want the small form factor there are plenty of other choices that are cheaper and less confusing .
The most wearable ipod ever. it's very tiny. very good design.. good build quality. trendy; buttons missing
Compact and Lightweight; Controls located on headphones, Over priced
Size - Stainless Steel Clip; Cannot run with it, controls on earbuds are terrible
small, lightweight, easy to use, apple quality, sturdy clip.; earbuds may start to hurt, battery life, very looseable.
Smal/sleekl design, same great quality you expect from Apple, and voiceover option.; None so far.
none, this product is worthless if it cannot work; breaks easier than anything I have ever owned...enough said
Slick design, very portable, good audio quality; Not able to use other earphones
I like the smaller size with more capacity.; Sync function.
small. made for exersizing. has a clip. durable. talks to you; no screen. no buttons(on player). 9-10 hour battery(average)
Small and lightweight; Does not work if you are exercising!
Size and simplicity of function; Reliability and need for special headphones.
It's small. That's it.; All controls on headphone cord - none on body of player. Cord too short. Earbuds impractical for exercise. Annoying voice navigation.
Small nice for running or biking.; Not operating correctly. Controls lock up after about 5mins and neither store or apple will do anything about it. LOUSEY CUSTOMER SERVICE
Attractive design, small size, noticeably better sound quality than previous iPod models, useful VoiceOver feature, ability to play different playlists; Earphone replacement can be a hassle, confusing controls, stops working while exercising
Small, simple, light, great for running; no dock connector, could have made a sturdier metal usb to headphone adapter rather than a flimsy cable
Small. Basic Design that camouflages itself easily when clipped to clothing.; Small Capacity. Pricing is non-competitive. Easily Lost. No Screen. Must buy $30 adapter to use non-apple headphones
I like the size of the shuffle.; It is not dependable!
Capacity; slot for hanging from a lanyard; only works with provided earphones; tiny size makes it easier to lose.
Great when it works. Enjoy the 48hrs to 2 weeks whilst it lasts.; Horrendously defective proprietary headphones, which last between 48 hrs to 2 weeks, make this a total ripoff. Don't waste your money.
Small, light, and inconspicuous.. Simple and easy controls.. 4GB (1000 songs).. Voice over is nice for picking playlists.; Must use apple headphones.
Easy to conceal, (I'll explain that later), syncs with iTunes; Small size makes it easy to lose, enclosed power cable is too short. Proprietary headset
Size, sleek design, intuitive interface; Sometimes I can't tell what's going on if I click it a few times, and it could be a little louder
Great price point, good design, great battery life. Control operations are straightfoward and simple.; There aren't any for the price.
size and headphone controls easy to reach; always breaking! can't control the thing in mid-play
Tough, simple, great sound, and personally i love the design.; having to control it with the apple headphones.
Inline controls.. Size.. Ease of use.; Not being able to use my H20 waterproof case that was designed specifically for my 2d-Gen Shuffle. (Guess I'll just have to keep the old Shuffle too)
size &#38; sound qualtity; horrible clickable controls; tiny and easy to mis-click; takes more error prone clicks to skip, reverse, fast forward or rewind. Past shuffles took a single and easy to place click to control the iPod.
Great size, intuitive controls, perfect fo running, can clip to shirt and not even know its there!; None - obviously would not use as only i-pod but perfect for working out
size, capacity, looks; Headphones fall out when walking quickly and pop out as soon as you jog.. The inline remote is so flimsy mine broke after the 1st week. If you ride a bike you will fall off before selecting the next track.. poor sound from ear phones
Small size is about all I can say positive about this Ipod.; Terribly designed..the Apple engineers defintely do not exercise who designed this new version of the Ipod Shuffle. Controls on the manufactor headphones which I do not use.
small, i cant think of anything else.; expensive for what if offers, weak battery life, no screen, have to use special headphones for controls...the list goes on and on.
sounds clear; headphone controls die within a week and new headphones cost almost as much as the entire unit. battery doesn't stay charged long at all. you'll feel ripped off soon after you buy it and the crappy headphones die on you.
It's small. It plays music. It looks pretty.; Double and triple clicking to change the song? Whoever designed these controls is not a runner.
Naturally, the small, light, and compact size would be great for running. Enough storage space.; First shuffle broke after 5 uses (while running). Apple replaced right away but the second broke almost immediately; voiceover starts to malfunction and then quickly the controls become totally unusable.
Tiny; certainly plays music fine; voice announcements (if you need/want that); innovative controls on its headphone cord; Limited features; plain industrial-like design; computer voice; need the proprietary headphones or to further buy third-party replacements (or an adapter cable), not yet out; for features, much better options exist, such as the SanDisk Sansa Clip
Small, minimalist. Easy to carry. Seems sturdy and well made. Voice Over is useful.; Expensive for the capacities. Needing to buy earphone adapter. Voice Over not always accurate with even popular artists.
Size, easy to use and stays out of the way.; Controls take a little to get use to.
light weight, high storage, sleek design; you can't switch mid-song, you need to use the apple earbuds to operate, and the controls on the earbuds are too close to the earpiece
Apple brand and small size; Will last you 10 minutes into your workout and then quit. Hint of sweat causes a malfunction - all controls stop working, sound is turned up all the way up or all the way down
None really - can play apple protected material and the drive does not fall apart like those of the bigger ipods with a mini (i fall apart at the slightest provocation) disk drive; The control has a life span of about one week.
It is very small, and can use Itunes, has a clip.; Have to purchase adapter for different headphones. Overpriced when compared to others in its category. No screen. Very difficult to select music.
Small and out of the way design; - earbuds fall out constantly. - can't use any other earbuds due to remote control issues. - not exercise friendly
Can attach it to almost any part of your clothing and you'll never feel it's there.. The control scheme is actually quite convenient for exercise.; Difficult to find particular tracks, especially considering it is 4 GB.. can't hook up to playback devices easily.. Can't use other earphones.
Light. Apple software.; Headphone wire as control - not great for runners. Battery is weak. Volume and song advancement freeze up. Sticks - does not allow for song selection and does not allow the volume to adjust when battery level is getting low. Almost too small.
Small, Compact and 4GB for $80 Good deal.; All the control are on the earphone. I spent over $100 for a bose earphone not long ago and now I can't use it.
Size, price for 4gb ipod, looks; Earphones are just terrible. They feel like cheap elastic - don't stay in the ear and since the controls are in them, you can not use other headphones. Very limited use item
This has got to be the easiest and best shuffle yet. Working out, working in the yard, etc. is the perfect place for this. Now when someone wants to talk to you, no more fumbling to find the wheel to pause.; Clip should open from opposite end to keep cord out of way.
Small and 4GB; Too Small, new button system is terrable, and the head phones a weak so I'll have to spend more money to get any value out of it,
Cheap,simple, great sound quality, voice over that tell you the song and artist, size of a paper clip, and clips on to pretty much anything; No display, and can be "boring".
nothing at all; Shuffle's shape is not conducive to exercising with. The ear phones are awkward and difficult to use while running. The battery does not last that long and the ear buds do not stay in your ears well. I'm going back to the much better older shuffle.
The multiple play list selection ability, the small size; I dont like not being able to replace the headphones, to use my Itunes car accessessory that I got for my previous IPOD Shuffle, and the very low headphones sound
It can talk which can be a good thing.; Easier to lose, more expensive, you have to use combinations of button presses to skip forward or backward (which probably means you can't fast forward or rewind. If you lose the headphones you have to buy poor sounding ones from Apple for $30.
Size of device is nice and compact/lightweight. Price is good, but you get what you pay for...; My headset stopped working after 2 weeks! I believe due to perspiration running down cord and into the control piece. Headset cord is too short. Battery life is on the weak side.
Solid feature pack. Relatively easy to navigate controls on ear buds, excellent capacity and adding playlists are a big bonus.; False advertising: this product can NOT be used to exercise. With 15 minutes of every work the controls on the ear buds start to random cycle operations (volume up/down, listing playlists, etc) and quickly quits working completely.
small, light weight and sleek; Ear bud controls not optimal for exercizing, short out leaving no functionality.. Shape is uncomfortable to clip to neck of shirt while exercizing.. Summary: I wouldn't buy this again until it comes with better headphones. I am very disappointed.
Miniscule. You can tape it to your Bose Quiet 3 �phones . So no dangling cables !. The supplied headphones actually fit quite well in my ears, whereas brands such as Etymotic don't without discomfort and unwanted pressure. Excellent quality.; So far nothing at all. Just make sure you don't have any songs in there that you don't really want to listen to over and over. On larger iPods we all have lots of stuff we never bother with. The idea here is to go minimal in a big way.
NONE!!!!. fits down the drain. can choke on it. can get stuck up nose. can flush it. can mistake for trash that it is!; -no buttons. -loose your ear buds or thow them away because they sound like a dead rat. and your screwed , no buttons to control your music
Absolutely none. Small size? There are plenty of tiny mp3 players out there that don't sacrifice usability.; Why anyone would buy the Shuffle is beyond me. It is not a perfect exercise companion like the fanboys suggest. Just thinking about trying control the Shuffle while on the treadmill makes me want to curse Apple.
Tiny; doesn't weigh a thing. Easy to use controls. Excellent battery life. Elegant and simple appearance. 4GBs of storage.; Almost too small; I'm afraid I'll lose it! Kind of sucks that I had to pay $20 extra so I could use 3rd party headphones. Such an adapter should come with the device. Wish they hadn't made it so scratchable.
Metal and tough to destroy.; Just about everything else. Controls on the ear buds are terrible. Just too small for a normal sized person. I had trouble controlling the shuffle with the controls on the ear buds (fingers are too big I guess.) Sound quality is sub-par.
None. Slightly smaller than 2nd generation, but really--do you need it any smaller?; 1. As a runner, I have to use the crappy apple earphones that fall out of my ears. 2. I now have to reach up to shoulder level to change songs or adjust volume--again, not good if running
The small size makes it easy to clip onto your clothes.; There is no navigation on the actual ipod. The navigation is also akward and hard to figure out. This was the first time I had to open the instruction manual to use any of apple's normally user friendly devices
The size and simplicity mkes it suitable for a lot of users.; It has nowhere near the capability of an iPod touch or Nano at a price that is close to half their cost. It could be sold at half the price and still be profitable. But it is new technology and the early adopters always seem to pay more.
Small size; 1. Sound malfunctions when you perspire.. 2. Controls are hard to use while in motion, like running or riding a bike.. 3. Sometimes the selection of playlists is less that easy with the in-line control.. 4. Earbuds come out of my ears while exercising.
The shuffle 3G is a sexy little device, the smallest MP3 player on the market and really convenient. I loved having access to different playlists to change routines day to day or be able the access the song name if I was listening to a new CD.; Biggest negative: volume control. The control itself is a little clunky and hard to manuever on a run. My main complaint was that it wasn't moisture resistant. If the volume control gets sweaty (as it touches your neck / shirt) it stops working.
While cycling or running you have no time to look at a screen, you can control this iPod blindfolded!; The headphone wire is too long; I clip the ipod on my shirt or bag, and I need only half the length
simple design, sold product, but comes with shoddy headphones. such a great idea, and the ipod itself if great.; one drop of sweat equals malfunctioning headphones. they are nice about replacing them multiple times (because they are aware of the flaw), but you shouldnt have to go back to the store for new headphones every time you go running
Well,, the most interesting part of this product is its simplicity.. I'm really sure Apple didn't made any mistakes in designing this shuffle.. Also, the VoiceOver+Playlists+Audiobooks+Podcasts features really adds the fun of having a screenless iPod.; The idea of moving the controls to the buds was great, but what I don't like is that if you destroy the buds, the shuffle itself is a bit useless.. well, we all know that there are companies making compatible to the Pod, but it's really that pricey.
Small size, clean design.; TERRIBLE earbuds that do not stay in ears, and especially fall out whenever trying to use cord adjustment controls- terrible design. Controls are difficult to access and there is a lot of fumbling trying to use the controls.
Teeny, tiny. Innovative controls. Weighs nothing. Strong metal clip. VoiceOver. Highly portable. Love using it with my own headphones+adapter. I can even clip this sucker to my BRA!; I can hardly use the included headphones. Wish it had a radio tuner. Probably would be hard to learn the theory behind using controls if this is your first mp3 player. It's kind of annoying to use when I have to skip through a long list of playlists.
Great size, built-in clip makes it great for exercising; The earbuds are worthless. Like everyone else, I am seeing issues with the shuffle not working after moisture gets near it. The selection control is placed in a bad location, making it likely to get sweat on it. This is a bad design by Apple.
It's hard not to be impressed with this much memory packed into a player so small. Especially helpful when you use it while running or working out. Maybe the next innovation: wireless earbuds?; Battery capacity is allegedly 12 hours, but in reality closer to four or five. Earbud controls work only intermittently. Apple sells an adapter (of course)with separate controls which also allows you to use different headphones.
i just bought it and i like it... i have the 16gb itouch and didnt like bringing it to school because things are getting stolen alot. and its easy to use and it has a big enough to hold all the music i want.; i dont like the fact that im stuck with apple head phones right now but i am looking forward for the adapter and so i can use my skull candies.
Paperclip size makes it highly portable; improved sound quality; 4 gigs for $80 not a bad price. It would be a great product and merit a better review if not for the cons listed below...; The headphones. Bad move Apple. Placing the controls on the ear buds themselves and making the headphones so cheap that they quit working if any amount of sweat gets on them. BAD APPLE, BAD!!!
Ok, so the unit is small and clips on to your shirt, shorts, anything. In my opinion that's the only pro of this unit.; 3 pair of replacement headphones and still same issue. I wasted $70.00 on this. If you plan to work out with this (run, etc), be advised if you get sweat on the headphone controls they will stop working. Save your Money get the 2nd gen shuffle.
It's small indeed, and if you just turn it on and leave it alone it's fine.; The control thing on the wire of the earbuds is the worst design I've ever seen. I'm a die-hard Apple guy but they flunked bigtime on this one little aspect, but it's a huge oversight. I went back to my 1MB Shuffle.
Small &#38; light, the clip is great! Plays music.; The buttons are on the headphone wire. I can not use the headphones that come with the IPOD as they fall out and hurt my ears. Therefore, I am now forced to buy headphones that are more expensive than the shuffle was just to use the device.
Small. better USB cable then generation 2. The earbud cord is longer then generation 2 as well. Voice over is a very cool feature.; My main gripe about this ipod is the complete lack of fast forward and rewind. I listen to alot of podcasts so when I accidently restart a podcast I have to restart the whole podcast over. I also find it awkward to use controls on the headphones wire
Compared to 2nd generation shuffle: there is absolutly nothing I like in this third generation iPod Shuffle. It is a real design mistake.; Poor design, earphones and controls are very bad, if earphones get wet the shuffle stops working (don't do gym or jog with it), you can't use your older earphones, and the battery does not last long (compared to 2nd generation),
