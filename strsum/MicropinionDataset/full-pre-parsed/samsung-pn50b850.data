the best tv i have ever seen  .

the sytling is incredible , not much on glare , and just overall phenominal picture quality  .

since all samsung ultra    thin displays have terrible speakers i didn't expect much and is impressed or dissapointed with the sound  .

it was meh  .

same as the led's but for nearly half the price i respected cnet a lot but they have lost considerable respect in my eyes since labeling led's having the best picture ever  .

standing in front of led's playing hdtv and blu    rays for the better part of 8hrs i have to say , as well as the general customer opinion , the plasma's cannot be beat i have had many a customer come in looking specifically for the led's , previously the un55b8000/7000 and having the be surprised by how much better a picture the b850 has  .

yes the led's are great and make me more money but majority of people prefer the plasma's  .

and do not think , oh it's the price  .

i work near blackhawk , ca an incredibly rich area and it's not uncommon for a resident to come in and drop a few grand on a handful of tv's right after buying all new appliances for their home  .

people just seem to outright prefer the performance and look of the plasmas , specifically the b850  .

i'm contemplating purchasing the b850 or waiting to buy the 2010 pn50c8000 with a new three processor setup and the tru black cone as well as it being 3d capable and supposedly retailing for the same price as the b850's normal price , $2099 i'm not trying to discourage people for buying an led because it's all about what you think looks best since it is your money right  .

but whatever your heart desires , but believe me when i say the b850 has a phenomenal picture  .

watch the imax sequence of the dark knight when the police are transporting harvey dent under the roadway and are attacked by the joker in an 18 wheeler  .

just incredible the buzzing issue has been solved as of august 2009 fyi  .

all b850's manufactured after august 2009 do not have the buzzing issue updated  .

great t  .

spent months trying to decide between samsung 850 and the panny g    10  .

so glad i went with the samsung  .

sears had it on sale for $1489 but did not have any instock  .

went to best buy and they do not advertise that they had the 850 ( they push the 860) i saw the 850 for $1899  .

i told them about sears having the same t  .

v for $1489  .

so the did a price match even after they found out that not one sears store in san diego had the t  .

v in stock  .

setting up t  .

v is a breese  .

and when i turned it on , no buzz ( thank god  .

) picture looks great and looking at the picture is like being right there with them , real life like , sound it good but i did buy a samsung sound bar to get a little deeper base  .

but sound is fine without the soundbar  .

if u are thinking of buying another t  .

v , think real hard because u cant go wrong with this t  .

cannot wait for charger season to start , i even cacelled my charger season tickets so i can buy the nfl ticket from direct t  .

v and stay home and watch my chargers kick butt on this great t  .

hope this review helps u in knowing that u cant go wrong by buying this t  .

v go bolts  .

overall , i am extremely satisfied with this purchase  .

cutting edge everything  .

best tv ever  .

it's so beautiful , dynamic , vibrant and colorful    totallly natural    not overblown or artificial  .

it's like watching a film in a theatre (with hd input that is)  .

it looks elegant too  .

love the internet connectivity with streaming video from netflix , amazon , etc  .

with an internet blu    ray player  .

have noticed no buzz whatsoever  .

sound is decent    i'm hesitating to hook up a stereo to it since it does pretty well on its own  .

i'm sure audio could be improved but i have not been motivated to go through the hassle  .

it does have a mixer    style level adjustment in the menu to tailor the sound , so of course i boosted the bass response this bears no resemblance to what i remember as tv , even though i came off a crt hdtv (albeit without a blu ray)  .

i watched 3 movies in a row yesterday , all streamed  .

not sure if that's a good thing  .

my wife and i went to the store with almost preconceived ideas about what kind of tv we wanted to bring home  .

we wanted to see them side by side and decide for ourselves which one looked the best to us  .

after much deliberation in the store , we narrowed the field to two and ultimately selected the samsung over the other model  .

they did not have any in stock , so we had to wait a few days for the next shipment to arrive  .

we were initially very happy with our selection when we got home , we started reading the user reviews of the tv that we had committed to and panic began to set in  .

a bunch of user reviews claimied that there is a distracting buzz that plagues this model  .

some even suggested that the design is defective it is sad that others have had this experience , but i'm pleased to report that there is no audible buzz coming from our samsung pn50b    850  .

some of the reviews stated that the buzz began after a month or so of use , but ours has been quiet for at least that long  .

i'm an experienced audio technician who has worked in live and studio sound environments and a buzz like the one described would probably send me over the edge  .

fortunately our tv is stone quiet    even when there is a bright picture being displayed .

no buzzing at all  .

wanted a panasonic but the lihgt shade of green yellow turns me off  .

have had for 30 day now went with c    net settings and am ver pleased with it  .

i am one not onboard with the lcd craze updated  .

on sep 25 , 2009  .

for those buffoons that note the buzz and hot issue , you are wrong  .

the buzz and heat are only amplified when running in dynamic viewing mode  .

who watches in that mode  .

it's for the best buy showroom  .

geesh amazing plasma tv , great price despite what cnet thinks compared to similar led models from samsung go for it  .

i'm an electronics sales associate and i truly love this tv  .

i'm eagerly waiting for cnet's review because i give this tv a 9  .

wow  .

that's what i say every time i turn this thing on , or just look at it as i walk by  .

it's also what my friends say when they have a look too the picture quality is stunning  .

i had mine callibrated and it blows anything i've ever seen right out of the water  .

(except for the $5 , 000 pioneer plasmas) as cnet states , the picture quality is superb  .

i know that people always talk about how good lcds are getting , and how great the new leds are , but i just love the colors you get with plasmas  .

i think they look the best out of the three categories , and this tv especially i use this set mainly for movies , and it looks spectacular  .

i use mostly in very low lit conditions , but i imagine that it would perform great even in brighter lit rooms too one thing i have fallen in love with is how easy it is to customize your picture and how many options you have for adjusting it perfect to your likings  .

i also use it for infrequent gaming , and it's very nice to be able to have the picture control settings completely independant of eachother the menus are really great and easy to use  .

i am never stuck searching around for something that i found once , and now cannot remember how to get back to it  .

the remote control is also nice , although , i never use it because of the use of a harmony universal now to the buzz  .

if i just turn on the tv with no sound and it is quiet in the room , i can faintly hear the buzz that everyone is talking so much about  .

but as soon as i start watching anything with sound , no matter how low the volume , i cannot hear the buzz anymore  .

maybe that's just from me going deaf though blasting my klipsch ht too much   ) either way , the buzz doesn't bother me a bit , because i cannot hear it the only real drawback on this set i would say is the price  .

as cnet says , it has the same great picture quality of the other series , which do cost a pretty penny less  .

obviously with this set , you are paying for the incredible design , which in my book is totally worth it  .

and if you want a tv to wall mount , this is it overall i would say it is an excellent purchase and i have not regretted it once .

this tv has one issue and one issue only  .

slow widgets  .

dont let that one small issue change your mind about this tv because your not gonna be using that as much as you may think  .

the picture quality is worth $2500+ and you can get it for $1500  .

if your looking for a good tv to watch your sports and blu rays on with a picture that will suck you in and are willing to spend the money than get this tv  .

outstanding plasma screen at only 1  .

2 inches  .

plug    in ports very nice to access with swivel base  .

menu settings allow for setup of multiple hues , tones , and colors  .

ability to increase or decrease blacks  .

truly an excellent picture  .

this is an excellent system  .

blacks are near that of the newer led's (although those are not true led sets)  .

sleek style make this an outstanding buy ($1 , 580 on 10/5/09)  .

samsung should include a home theater soundbar speaker system and that would bring this to a five star rating .

this is an amazing tv that i would recommend to anyone  .

great buy  .

(aside from the plastic piece that attaches the tv to the base    see cons )  .

i still love panasonic but this really raises the bar  .

i have no buzzing issues , maybe its because my tv is manufactured in january 2010  .

not sure  .

whatever the case may be , great tv , great sound and display no buzzing  .

i called samsung and the call center person said to return it or a tech would come to check it out  .

i love the tv but would really like the buzz gone  .

trying to decide on trying another one , let the tech  .

try , or go to a panasonic updated  .

on feb 3 , 2010  .

i own this tv  .

it buzzes more than a plasma should  .

late at night when the kids are in bed and the volume is down you can really hear it  .

annoyingly so  .

during the day with all of the ambient noise it is not that noticeable but i know it's still there  .

the lighter the scene the louder the buzz (ie   watching a hockey game  .

the buzz is really loud) and commercials/anything with graphics on    screen seem to set it off  .

a samsung tech is coming in to fix this  .

if you read online threads the problem has been fixed since late summer but i bought mine prior to this for that negative i must say that i do not think i've seen such a clear , perfect picture  .

colours are vibrant and perfect , the menu is easy to navigate and seems endless on picture adjustments  .

watching hockey/sports on this is flawless , no motion blur compared to lcd  .

sd and hd is outstanding not many inputs other than the 4 hdmi  .

my wii uses up all 5 rca inputs but with the panel being so thin you have to sacrifice something i do not regret buying this tv , just pray that the tech can fix the buzzing so i can really enjoy the experience that much more .

great set and on par with my 42 panny buzzing  .

the reveiwers that hear buzzing need to back off their alcohol intake as it's probably more mental then actual  .

nothing of the sort in my set .

if you want a great picture this is the tv for you but do not expect the extra features to work  .

if you want stylish design over picture quality what is wrong with an led  .

you can easily get a better picture and save $800 buying a g10 or a b650  .

i look forward to samsung making thinner and thinner plasma panels but not at the sacrifice of picture quality , overall functionality and cost effectiveness  .

i loved this tv but unfortunately the loud buzzing is very annoying  .

i wo not trust cnet again for not mentioning this , because it is all over the internet too  .

or go listen for yourself , it starts after a few hours of use .

nice looking picture and good style  .

but the heat issue worries me  .

i'd stay away from this years model and wait for them to address the issue in the 2010 release  .

if you are desperate for an ultrathin in 09 i'd go with the ln55b6000/8000  .

colors look better to me and it'll run more efficiently with no heat .

purchased 8/31/09    my only complaint is with the buzzing other issues related to picture performance i can live with samsung should really have rectified this issue prior to production if i cannot resolve the issue by 9/5/09 the set will be returned .

the buzzing is very real  .

it varies in severity based on the image and input  .

i would not mind a constant buzz so much but it goes from relatively high pitched to low pitched  .

it can really ruin a quiet moment in a movie or show  .

i'm going to return this tv after having it for a week  .

this tv costs so much    basic quality should be a given .

i cannot believe david katzmaier neglected to include the buzzing defect in his review  .

escpecially since there are multiple threads about the buzz problem on cnet  .
