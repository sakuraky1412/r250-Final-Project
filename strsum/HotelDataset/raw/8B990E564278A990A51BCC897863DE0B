the buffet does not always deliver what is advertised , however there is always plenty of choice and it is of very good quality overall .
watch out for the `` zilwa attitude '' taxi rates which are comfortably more expensive than the next door calodyne sur mer - walking outside the gate drops the price by 300 rps . . .

finally , namrata and gawtam were excellent staff members , but it is almost a little unfair to pick out individuals as there were a lot of very good service moments over the 10 days .
