Pros:. Outstanding picture, great sound. Right out of the box it doesn't need any tweaking... 
Cons:. Not the brightest picture I've seen in a brightly illuminated room. But at night it spectaclar. 
Summary:. Great value for the price.....Got mine as an old model closeout for $943.01 at Sam's Club.... For TV that won't be used other than for DVD or Blue Ray watching it is an incredible value....... 

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous Picture, Absolutely no noticeable Onscreen Glare, Easy to understand step by step Set-Up, 120HZ is oh so smooth, Good Sound with TV Speakers alone, Excellent Viewing from all angles, multiple Picture Modes Settings, etc, etc, etc.. 
Cons:. Flimsy Remote, Only ?Wide? and ?Zoom? Screen size options available with HDMI input feed. Not at all ?Deal Breakers?.. 
Summary:. Over the past six months I have looked at countless LCD, and Plasma tvs, both online and in stores. Bottom Line I love this TV! I am a 48 year old who can hardly be called ?Tech Savvy? by any stretch; this is my first ?HDTV?. It is also the first time I have ever spent over $350.00 for a Television. After several months researching any and all information on HDTVs the deciding factors in my purchasing this TV we?re 1) David Katzmaiers review on CNETs ?Best HDTVs overall?/?Best Cheap HDTVs? and 2) Found the #1 choice, the Vizio SV470XVT on sale at Sam?s Club for $998.00 back this past January 09.. What a great buy! My main concern, after overall quality of course, was ?glare? as my great room has a full Bay Window, French Doors, and another large Window, all facing the TV. At high noon the only glare visible is on the black ?Piano Finish? outer frame. The screen itself is virtually free of glare, and the picture is beautiful!. The one thing I must disagree with David on is the ?Black Levels?. To me the black definitely looks, well, black.. To sum up let me just say this, in hind-sight, I would definitely pay more than the sale price I gave for this TV, and it?s absolutely fantastic! Thanks again David, great call!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. I can't believe the lack of respect VIZIO gets. I have 2, one I bought when they first started out - it is fantastic, now I have this as well and want to know how anyone can compare the actual bang for buck against these TV's.. 
Cons:. Absolutely nothing, I wish I felt this good about everything I buy, not like VISTA! And, I have no idea what is "pedestrian" about the TV? The picture and feature match almost any TV out there.. 
Summary:. It is not possible to beat the value of this TV right now.. 

$$;
Pros:. very nice picture quality, price, ease of setup. 
Cons:. bit hard to access I/O jacks on the bottom back; would b nice to have power and basic control buttons on TV too. 
Summary:. We have been very happy with this one! We first bought a 47 inch 60Hz Vizio from Costco and then got a coupon in the mail next week that had a $300 off on the 47 inch 120Hz Vizio. So, within 10 days, returned the first buy and picked this one up. With the coupon, a price tag of $999 was sweet! We could immediately feel a big difference in picture quality between the old and new TV. Quality improvement was noticed on digital cable, standard DVD and HD channels. We love this one! The package was very easy to open up and assembly was done in 10 mins. The only two items we would've like to see better on the TV are (a) better positioning of the I/O ports on the bottom back and (b) power and basic channel/volume buttons to be present on the TV unit itself. Need to locate the remote everytime we have to turn on the TV :).. Overall, great value for money. I haven't really compared picture quality with other high priced, big brand names but why bother when we're happy with this one?. 

$$;
Pros:. 120Hz refresh rate, 1080p Plasma, Full High Definition LCD, settings controls. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. What's really great about this tv is the new 120Hz, while most tv's have the 60Hz (60 cycles per second). It really makes a difference in the picture. It truly is a High-def experience for me, especially watching my sports. I did a lot of research and read tons of reviews, and my other options were Sony and LG, but I feel Vizio offers the same tv, but for a cheaper price. I mean, the closest price I found was the 40? Sony Bravia and it was going for $2,200! I've always been a fan of Vizio and their line and now they're new XVT series really adds the icing on the cake.. 

$$;
Pros:. compared to other lcds it has best picture and value. why pay more. 
Cons:. not enough plug in the rear of unit for people with a lot of devises and video games. 
Summary:. have had the tv for a year now for our family room and has been running all the time without any problem. Great picture and value compared to other lcd tvs' for the price. Only this that is that is problem is that there are not enough plugs behind the tv for people that have a lot of component and video game units. there are extra plug on the side but not very clean when you have a lot to plug in and have to use the side of tv also. Should have more plugs in the rear also!!!! other than this it is a great tv and have just now upgrade it to another vizio but 55". 

$$;
Pros:. crisp picture, attractive cabinet, 4 hdmi inputs, and very reasonable price. 
Cons:. remote range is a little short. 
Summary:. this is my first venture into the lcd market as my other tv's were plasma. really enjoying the crisp colors and the overall picture that the vizio is giving me. the one thing i've found so far that could be better is the remote radius. you almost have to be dead on for it to work and the function keys make a "clicking" noise that gets kinda old.. bought it at compusa for $819 and added the $179 2yr onsite warranty. so far the price it seems to be a great value.. Updated. on Aug 22, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Great price for a 120hz T.V. . Great picture, good sound. Easy-to-use remote features.. 
Cons:. Slight graying of picture if viewed from below and to the side. A tilting mount takes care of this. Really a non-issue.. Remote feels a bit flimsy but works fine.. 
Summary:. Excellent value in this size of a T.V. . No need to pay more.. 

$$;
Pros:. tv looks great, black outline, better remote, easy hook-ups. 
Cons:. slight blurs on sports. 

$$;
Pros:. 1080p, 120 Hz, 4 HDMI ports, great picture and sound.. 
Cons:. Not all 4 ports are in the back. I found the menu structure a little awkward till I got use to it.. 
Summary:. Before purchasing this set from Costco, I compared it to other sets at the local Sears store. Putting this set against the higher price Sony's and Samsung's I was hard pressed to notice a difference in the picture quality. I viewed the set watching movies, sports, games, I tossed everything at it. After watching football in HD on this set I was sold. Great TV for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredible value.. 
Cons:. It's not the best LCD TV I've seen, but it is at this price range.. 
Summary:. I had originally bought the 42" for $997 at Sam's Club about a month ago. Now Sam's Club has the 47" for $998. Needless to say I returned the 42" and purchased the 47" for $1 more and they transferred the extended warranty I purchased for the first TV. It's definitely a great deal at this newer lower price!. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, features, picture. 
Cons:. so so remote, 120 hz needs work. 
Summary:. I researched flat panel tvs for months and kept waiting for prices to drop. I was in the 1000.00 to 1400.00 price range and really wanted the samsung 650 but the price would not come down to my range. I always passed this tv by when I was at costco because of the poor picture and the fact that it was an "off" brand. Even with the reviews saying it was a good product I was still unsure. But Costco came out with a coupon that made it less than a thousand so I decided to give it a try. I really like this tv! I have comcast HD and a panasonic blue ray player and both look great. I do have an issue with the comcast signal though, there is a vertical line about 3/4 of an inch from the left side. I assume that is an issue with comcast not the tv since there is no line when playing dvd's. Bottom line is, this is a really nice tv, it is easy to mess with the settings and the picture is very good. I am watching the Giants/Eagles game right now and it looks great!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great color, have yet to see motion blur of any kind, stylish new design.. 
Cons:. Black is only 95% black.. 
Summary:. I thought I was determined to purchase the Samsung 120hz LCD until I saw the reviews, and spoke to the sales associates about the Vizio. Its hard to debate with a company whos shown 75% growth rate the past 5 or so years. They are quickly becoming the next big thing. Love the new TV!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of inputs sid eand back. i do agree that the 2 HDMI inputs on the side can be a bit unsightly, but I found that I can wrap the cables around the back and they are pretty much invisible.. 
Cons:. The set developed a problem 4 months after I purchased it. Anywhere there was a dark or magenta area, it would have bright lime-green pixels. These pixels would move with the picture so they were not dead.. 
Summary:. Vizio support ended up having several boards and cables replaced in the set which fixed the problem. Unfortunately, the problem came back two months later and Vizio came out and replaced the set entirely. Overall, I would give Vizio support a "B" for performance and the set a "B" due to its maintenance problems, although I have not seen any other incidence of this in other reviews on the Web.. 

$$;
Pros:. The TV is great for the price.. 
Cons:. Warranty is non-existant as far as cosmetics go. Scratches etc. are ok with them.. 
Summary:. The above about sums it up. Great for the price, BUT. It was shipped with a broken plastic cable holder. When I contacted support I was told it wasn't covered under warranty because it was cosmetic, this could mean scratches, gouges etc. are ok with vizio. I purchased it from Dell, they were fantastic, even offered to send me a new TV. Vizio couldn't supply them with the $2.00 plastic holder.. Picture is bright and clear. I can't find any major cons with the TV itself.. Updated. on Jan 24, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Very reasonablly priced LCD HDTV. I got 32" at $399. Compare this price to $499 at Sam's Club or higher at somewhere else. The trick is to get a refurbished unit. A refurbished unit has only 3 month warranty. Add one more year $39 at www.vizio.com.. 
Cons:. If this is your first HDTV, or you don't think you are going to watch much 1080 resolution on this unit, or color accuracy doesn't matter much, or your have a tight budget, it is satisfactory. But there is no comparison to a LED HDTV.. 
Summary:. If you have sharp eyes and/or are particular regarding colors and resolution and have tight budget, go get a LG LH90 series, which is a LED HDTV at 240Hz. I bought one prior to this unit and use it in my family room as my main entertainment TV. There is just no comparison either in color, sharpness, resolution, ease of adjustment, or the workmanship. When I set up the Vizio, not only I felt immediately the material, quality and workmanship was so much cheaper, the color and resolution is just not there. LG has a video Wizard that mad everything easy and accurate. I have to run back and forth between my two rooms (or you can set the Vizio next to the LG LH90) in order to get correct color adjustment.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap, large screen, decent picture quality (although the contrast wasn't as good as other TV's). 
Cons:. The remote control is a bit annoying and doesn't respond very well. You have to aim it at precisely the right angle. Also, for some reason, it wouldn't turn on after only 5 months. Customer support could have been better.. 
Summary:. It's a good tv for the price, and my past experience with Vizio sets have been positive. I'm sure that the problems I've had with this set breaking represent a fairly isolated incident. However, their customer support isn't exactly helpful and they take forever to get things done.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture is very crisp and sharp. Nice easy to see graphics.. 
Cons:. The sound! Speak through a tube - that's what it sounds like. The EQ does little to affect this. Turn the center speaker on and bring back AM radio days. No USB port. Cool remote, but difficult to use with one hand.. 
Summary:. I'd keep it except the sound is so poor. So, I'l be returning it tonight.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice picture for the price. 
Cons:. Year and a half into ownership the tv made a popping sound and no longer works.. Vizio will not support the product even though it is a known fault of Vizio.. Search for POP OF Death and get a million results.. 
Summary:. Good if the tv doesn't die.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is great, sound quality is great, and the amount of connections available is perfect.. 
Cons:. I had this tv for 5 months and Vizio's horrible customer service would only offer me a recertified tv or spend $250 for the upgrade model. The upgrade model now costs $50.00 more than I paid for mine. Made a loud popping sound twice and now no power.. 
Summary:. Bottom line the tv when it worked had great picture quality and sound. Problem doesn't last long and Vizio's support is horrible. You alway's get what you pay for. I would highly suggest spending the extra money and getting a better tv.... 

$$;
Pros:. Looks great when working, sounds great with blu-ray.. 
Cons:. They come broken from the factory, remote does not work unless directly aimed at sensor.. 
Summary:. I bought mine at the end of february. By the May thescreen had turned completly green and would not show any othe colors. The repairman vizio sent over told me his also came from the factory with a similar defect. Vizio decided that the way to fix this problem was to send me a refurbished model. So much for spending 1300 dollars for a new TV. Next time I'll shop sony.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great value while when it works properly, 2 year warranty, great picture, comes with an HDMI cable - you can't find another 47" 1080p with 120hz at this price and if there was another one out there, I wouldn't trust Phillips, Olevia, etc.. 
Cons:. CRITICAL FAILURE - Vertical red lines appeared in all black areas of picture after 2 months of use, Vizio customer service is horrible, the rear a/v inputs plug in vertically,. 
Summary:. You are taking a risk when buying this TV- I used mine for 2 months when red vertical lines appeared in all the black areas in the picture. Thankfully, I still have another month to return to Costco. I've called Vizio customer service - they are terrible. I sent pics of the problem and called back in 2 days, they said to give them another 3-5 days when "someone" will call me and set up a time to come and look at it (that's where I'm at right now). So I have to wait until this "someone" calls me, I have set up another appointment with them (1-2 weeks), then if it can be fixed I have to wait for parts and a second visit (probably another 1-2 weeks), if it can't be fixed then I'll get a replacement refurbished TV (who knows how long that would take). I think I'm just going to play along until the 90 day mark (90 days from purchase date) and I'll just return it for a new one at Costco. The real value of Vizio is that if you buy from Costco-you are covered-just return it if something goes wrong.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheaper than more popular brands. 
Cons:. Screen just went black after one year from purchase date...asked Vizio to repair it and they said because it was over a year old they would not and we would ahve to pay 400 for repairs..cost 1000 initially, and for that you can get a better tv.. 
Summary:. Screen went black after just one year..when we spoke to customer service (5 times that we called) they continuously told us that because it had been a year the warranty was up and we had to pay the $400 for repairs out of pocket. Isn't a tv supposed to last for more than just one year??? Check out consumeraffairs.com for 13 pages worth of complaints from other customers...that is 130 people. This company is awful, their customer reps are RUDE (hung up on us twice) and the product is terrible. Please do yourself a favor and buy a Sony!!. 

$$;
Pros:. At 47", it was relatively less expensive than the rest of the 46" TVs.. 
Cons:. At any price, any electronics that lasts less than two weeks is a waste of money and time. Red vertical lines appear on the screen &#38; TV menu. According to Costco tech support, the problem is due to bad video card in the TV itself.. 
Summary:. Don't bother with it. I was lucky the problem appeared before the warranty expired.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price. Fantastic picture.. No artifacts when watching high speed action.. 
Cons:. Worked for a little over 2 months, then started displaying red vertical lines in many of the the black areas.. 
Summary:. After multiple calls to Vizio Tech support I was told that it was no longer covered by the warranty. Apparently, while I had only had it for about 70 days, the 3 weeks to took to be delivered ate up 1/4 of the warranty.. Don't buy a refurbished TV.. Vizio's TVs are cheep for a reason. They don't last.. 

$$;
Pros:. Worked great out of the box for about a week. 
Cons:. Frustrating experience with Vizio support ... returned to Sams Club. 
Summary:. Vizio needs to work on making the after sale experience ... Contacted Vizio about two weeks after purchase (red in black areas of screen) ... took them about a week to get someone onsite to repair ... the guy replaced most of the internal boards ... it worked for less then 24 hours and then had green image ... contacted vizio again ... they requested I fax Proof of Purchase so they could schedule an on-site replacement ... Had to fax them PoP several times over the next week ... then they screwed up and scheduled another on-site repair which their system kicked out ... I learned after I called them an umteenth time ... then told it would be 8-10 business days before I would be contacted to schedule an on-site replacement ... guess what the tv worked 10 days out of the box ... so I returned it and am trying out a 42in Phillips 120hz for about the same price. 

$$;
Pros:. Price &#38; original picture. 
Cons:. Warranty, company &#38; service. 
Summary:. TV good for 1 month then vertical line appeared. Manufactor warranty lousy Service lousy. Offered to replace with reconditioned TV saying out of 90 day warranty. Called within warranty period with problem. Lousy 90 day warranty period. Service very hard to get..
