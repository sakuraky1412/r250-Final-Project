i researched all options to watch movies in a darkened room  .

excellent picture is my most important criteria , within the budget my wife would allow  .

found recommended settings for the picture from several sources , tried them all and found what i liked best and it is awesome  .

i is expecting the increased black levels , and when it happened , i tweeked the settings and still love the picture  .

while i now wish i would have waited for the g20 or g25 , buyer remorse maybe , but in our house , only i noticed the increase black level , so maybe typical viewers wo not notice the tv does have a 24p playback mode , but for me it is not usable with the flicker  .

this is the only feature i wish i could make work for me , but i am not willing to pay the premium for a set that has this feature .

i think this tv is excellent because it has 1080p , 600hz  .

this tv can select sd cards on your tv for you to see pictures  .

it can download movies on the internet , so that way you don  .

t watch the movie without walking a mile to get your rented movie in the mail  .

this tv shows high crystal clear definition without any blur  .

cause with 1080p , you can see every object perfectly , and with 600hz , it can draw more details , and it  .

s drawn faster  .

this tv is something you can ask for your birthday , or for christmas for your family  .

it is one of the best tvs in the world , and it will be the best tv i ever got andre  .

austin texas  .

one of the best choices .

researched for months and kept coming back to the g10  .

compared it to lg and samsung side by side by side with the same movie showing and it won easily  .

walked into our local store and there it is for $400 less than future shop we walked home with the panasonic bd60 blu    ray player and waited for the set to arrive  .

wonderful combo  .

this is the perfect television and i have done my research  .

this is what i wanted from a home theater viewing experience and it is an experience  .

i previously had the samsung pn50b650 and panasonic s1 in my house , and there is no comparison  .

in my opinion , the debate between panasonic vs  .

samsung is over  .

there is a clear winner in picture quality , and that winner is panasonic  .

simply superior technology same could be said about plasma vs  .

lcd (including led based lcd tv's)  .

plasma is the superior technology  .

it (unfortunately) got a bad rap in it's infancy due to burn    in issues and short life span  .

but these problems are completely gone  .

it is up to people like me and other plasma owners to let the world in on what we are experiencing  .

led refresh rate , response time , black level , side angle viewing and color accuracy cannot compete with plasmas  .

period  .

they are making great strides , but are still trying to catch up and mirror the picture quality of a plasma in conclusion , i have waited for 8 years to get a hdtv  .

this is the purchase of my adult life  .

i is not biased or swayed any way toward any specific brand or type of tv except for looking at it myself  .

if you are looking to get a new , incredible , image    popping , blu    ray playing , video gaming , life changing , living room hub get a panasonic plasma  .

specifically , the panasonic tc    p50g10    j lyndon hughes  .

tv is a much different experience with hd and 50 inches of plasma  .

i am so happy i gave away the old sony xbr (worked perfectly) and made this purchase  .

if your on the fence , get off and go buy this tv  .

it is awesome  .

great out of the box picture  .

bluray , ps3 xbox 360 all look phenomenal  .

sexy bezel easy to figure out  .

3 years ago i is a staunch lcd guy  .

my 42 sharp aquos had a great picture , but after reading the reviews going to the store to see one in person i is sold  .

i have french doors about 5 feet away from this tv glare is not an issue with this set also my lcd had horrible picture wash out from slightly off angle , this set perfect  .

i highly recommend this set to anyone looking for a new tv .

after a month or so of research i settled on this tv and i couldn't be happier with my decision  .

i went back and forth between this tv , the v10 , and the samsung pn50b850  .

after reading a bunch of negative reviews about the samsung having a buzzing problem i had to choose between the g10 and the v10  .

i got the people at bestbuy to setup the two tv sets side by side to do some comparison  .

i brought the recommended settings from this site and tweaked each tv  .

in all honesty , the picture quality is nearly identical  .

the v10 has a very nice single sheet of glass coving the tv and looks sleeker than the g10  .

the 24p @90 is a great feature to the v10 , but i could not decide if it ultimately is worth spending an extra $500 to get  .

i decided to do a little more research before buying the tv and discovered sears is selling the g10 for $1299 , $300 less than bb  .

bestbuy priced matched 110% of the difference and that made my decision simple  .

$1269 for the g10 vs $2099 for the v10 is a no brainer for me  .

i have had the tv for two months now and have not regretted my decision even slightly  .

after breaking it in for 150 hours i tweaked all the settings and the picture is fantastic  .

deep blacks , rich colors , and overall great performance make this one the best tvs i have ever owned  .

i would highly , highly recommend this set to anybody .

this panny easily surpassed any lcd so far in my opinion only v10 better than this  .

i am 100 percent new to hdtv , never had an lcd , and this is the first large screen tv i owned  .

i really cannot say this tv has any flaws  .

thx appears to provide exact real life colors , which can be altered some to your liking  .

sd is soft and theater like  .

many sd channels appear sharp , but did notice a little soft edges  .

hdtv looks better (at home) than any lcd i saw in store  .

actually , i do not believe an lcd tv can proform as well as this plasma  .

viewing angles are great 170 degree in not impossible  .

motion is perfect fast and exact  .

thx is not too green , and cause enough to buy and why i did , not disapointed (yet)  .

i did not adjust vivid mode , but not good setting as is  .

when at a store i would be attracted to the bright lcds and would not like the appearent darker plasmas , at home i tell you i would not want it brighter there is no real darkness or green tint phenomena , people are just picking  .

i have it on warm 2 , but i read here that cool or other setting may even look better  .

okay , yes i imagined i saw a somewhat greenish tint in a couple faces's skin color , but i know that is because the natural real skin color is/was suppose to have that tint look to make the person look a little rough white and washed out  .

so i can say even the dark or green tint reviewed statements is ignorance , or subjective  .

another cause it when first turned on the thx appears to darken the screen  .

i did not test the brightness with a meter , and therefore , i must conclude that it is an illusion and in real case situations it does not exist  .

every one sees color differently , and only an objective set of measurements can tell the difference anyway  .

i have this tv in a full light room with the sun shining on the screen , and it reflects much less than a normal glass tube tv wow  .

i even had to look for the light reflection  .

again , i had it in thx brighness not set high  .

wow , and i thought the bright loud unfocused lcds would be better  .

glad i is not fooled  .

i must agree with one review i read ,   just turn on thx and get the best of the best  .

i do not know how thx is calibrated or configered in the hardware , i read one review that stated it is just a preset mode , and nothing worth paying any more for , all i can say is ; it is exact  .

i never had an lcd (and know it could not match this) i never had a plasma before  .

i have yet to watch a dvd or blu    ray  .

i can imagine that more controls would be nice , but then it would be more possible to screw    up the picture and chips , so it may be best as is  .

thx and mild adjusted brightness , and warmness etc  .

this is a real life review , from a person that never even owned a large screen tv before  .

for such a person , i think this is the tv  .

why would i want to buy a large item and find basic short comings like poor motion , focus , brightenss , and color  .

i could not risk it , so i got the g10  .

i doubt the v10 would add much real people value  .

therefore , upgrade s1 to g10 appears valid , but not g10 to v10  .

however , what makes this tv certainly will be placed in lower cost tvs soon .

i did my research before buying this tv and i could not be happier  .

it has an amazing picture , looks beautiful , and the price is right .

buy this tv if you want an amazing movie expeince without spending $3000  .

panasonic makes very solid tv sets that do not break like others do .

i am thoroughly satisfied .

a must buy for people who dont want to spend a lot on a tv  .

best tv in the world  .

still miss the ambilight from my phillips though .

panasonic continues to prove that its plasmas are the very best in the market  .

price and quality go hand in hand .

thx mode is great , it's more dim than the other modes but i prefer it that way  .

the other ones seem too bright my favorite feature is that i can run all of my audio sources into the tv (hdmi , component and composite) and run one optical and one av out to my receiver so i do not have to change the input on my receiver anymore , i can just leave the receiver on the tv input and when the signal is digital i get dolby digital and when it's not i get prologic i am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this tv to anyone .

for blu ray movies , ps3 , xbox 360 , this is an awesome panel  .

no motion blur , deep blacks , and suprisingly very bright picture  .

i have owned 2 plasmas prior to the g10 , also a sony sxrd tv , and this plasma blows the others away in picture quality .

comming from a 4 year old rear projection lcd i gotta say that tv tech has come a long way  .

even though i thought my old sony had a nice picture and worked well with my peripherals this panasonic blows it out of the water in every way imaginable  .

i've had the tv for a couple of months now and could not be happier .

i looked at and researched several tv's including the new samsung b series and a pioneer and 2 sony lcd's and frankly even without the price advantage (i paid $1511 at amazon) i know i made the right choice with the panny  .

i am so satisfied that i am in danger of becoming a couchpotato  .

lcd screens may be brighter but plasma is a much more natural picture  .

also motion is displayed much smoother than on even much more expensive 120hz tv's  .

until oled technology becomes wide spread this tv is the bomb baby  .

if you set picture mode @ vivid and contrast @ 100 then you can see one of the brightest hdtv ever with realy natural color .

this plasma is just quite spectacular  .

i am blown away with every bluray i watch .

as an electronics sales i think lcds have more advantages to the plasma  .

i give it a five star for trying hard to improve from the previous models .

anyone looking to purchase a new tv should really stop and take a look at this set  .

stunning picture quality , excellent feature's and a great price  .

and if you need another expert review check out hd guru's review of this set , they scored it higher in nearly every catagory than pioneer's 141 except solid black's and it came close but they did say the panasonic had better dark shadow detail .

like many , i researched ad nauseam before purchasing this set  .

lcd  .

s aren  .

t as natural , giving off a fake brightness which causes viewer fatigue after prolonged viewing , so the latest plasma offering is the best viewing experience available in my opinion i had a budget of up to $2500 , and toyed with the samsung a550 58  .

panel for $2100 , the pioneer 5020 50  .

for $2000 , or this one for $1700 street ($1999 retail)  .

best buy had just received two of the g10s , and is kind enough to set up one while i waited  .

they had it set up next to the pioneer 5020 and i is stunned  .

heck , even the sales rep is surprised  .

after all , the pioneer is it when it comes to plasmas not this time  .

the g10 is even more natural , showing that the pioneer 5020 is over saturated , almost giving the impression that the picture is computer generated at first , the pioneer appeared brighter and the colors more rich , but upon further examination , it is not natural at all , but an exaggerated representation of the real scene  .

as a result , the panasonic appeared more soft , but without any hint of a cloud layer over the top  .

it is a truer representation of the actual scene , which also gave it a greater 3d look  .

objects appeared where they should in space , making the experience more involving panasonic has done a great job with this new lineup , and for the money it  .

s just sick  .

d have preferred the 54  .

of this model , but it  .

s not going to be out for another 3 months (june) and i couldn  .

t wait updated  .

on apr 10 , 2009  .

after 10 months of ownership , it's time to review months of research looking for the perfect gaming and blu    ray watching set led me to this panasonic plasma  .

it's incredible  .

i'm sure you've read again and again how good the picture is so i won't spend ages telling you what you already know  .

in summation , the black levels are impeccable , the colors and contrast are excellent , and response time is great picture and performance [4  .

5/5]  .

as mentioned , the picture is incredible  .

the set claims to handle 24p signals but the flicker is awful when the screen is bright , which renders this function pointless  .

i find the thx mode too dark but the custom settings posted by cnet do the trick for watching blu    ray movies  .

when the screen displays areas of (near) white , small dancing pixels are noticeable  .

a good example of this is in the dark knight when christian bale and morgan freeman are descending/ascending the cargo lift/elevator into the large white    tiled room  .

this may be film noise or something else but it kind of bothers me at times  .

greyscale banding is noticeable when displaying b/w photos on    screen  .

for gaming , the set really shines  .

ps3 @ 1080p looks fantastic  .

xbox 360 @ 720p look nice (i'm stuck with a pre    hdmi model)  .

the wii @ 480p looks mediocre but bearable  .

if you're worried about burn    in , do not be  .

90% of the time my set is on i'm playing a game and i've never had image retention last longer than a few minutes  .

additionally , the set handles 480i signals well construction [5/5]  .

sleek and stylish  .

it's a very attractive set that screams quality  .

the set makes a little noise (electrical hum) while it's on but it's only noticeable during silent scenes  .

some will argue that glare is a concern but i consider it a non    issue as the set does an excellent job of preventing glare compared to my old crt  .

connectivity is average and adequate       no complaints there vieralink features[3  .

5/5]  .

it's nice to watch youtube videos and view picasa pics but overall the interface is a bit ugly  .

moreover , the controls are sluggish and typing on the remote is downright painful  .

it seems yahoo  .

widgets enabled tvs out stride vieralink  .

no wifi and occasionally connectivity is fickle though that may be my local connection  .

viewing pictures on the set is slow but a nice feature other things to think about  .

it heats up the room a little bit (not great from warmer climates)  .

it consumes more power than a comparable lcd  .

burn    in is possible but difficult (be careful not to pause and forget)  .

it's delicate  .

the large pane of glass can easily crack if you tilt the set to far from vertical it has an incredible viewing angle more inches and quality for the money compared to lcd the picture is wonderful  .

updated  .

on jul 4 , 2010  .

i had a similar experience with several earlier reviewers  .

after researching all these tvs ad nauseum , i saw one live in the big box store is completely underwhelmed  .

however , i held my breath bought one from an on line retailer anyway  .

could not be happier now  .

looks nothing like what i saw in the store  .

it's plenty bright for any situation despite the lack of color adjustments it has a spectacular , accurate display i'd recommend this tv to anyone based on price/value/performance  .

spending $500+ more for only marginal improvements is not worth it to me .

i bought this tv primary for movies watching , and i couldnï¿½t make a better choise , i also play vide games once in a while and it handles great if your concern is any of this two that this tv is the right choise for you , although i would recommend a lcd if your primary objective is vide games .

allow me to address the following first    .

and as with last year's sets , selecting 48hz on the g10 causes flicker       more intense in brighter areas , but visible pretty much constantly       that basically renders the image unwatchable  .

this is outrageous  .

i watched the blade runner blu    ray last night with a ps3 at 48hz on this set and i could not find this flicker even when i tried hard to see it  .

the only flicker i could see is on the still images of the menu elements but that's is perfectly normal because it's not film  .

the film itself looks amazing  .

pans didn't stutter at all and overall it beautifully recreated the feel of film as opposed to the electronic , clinical look of high frame rates  .

it's just absurd to me that cnet is encouraging users to ignore one of the best features of this set  .

of course 48hz has a noticeable flicker    it's a lower frame rate dummy  .

but you're still getting double the frame rate of when you go to a theater  .

did you get that  .

you get the benefit of reproducing accurate film cadence while getting twice the frame rate resolution of a film you'd see in the theater i just cannot express how stupid this criticism is  .

perhaps if cnet doesn't like the look of low frame rates they should not go to the movies anymore  .

the way they describe it you would think the picture is freaking out or something  .

it's pretty much the opposite of unwatchable    it's the best i've ever seen film look on a tv next up , we have the thx is too dim and green stuff again this is not a deal    breaker like some paint it to be  .

first of all thx , mode looks fantastic  .

the colors make films look perfect  .

do not use this setting for anything else besides film content  .

it's not meant for tv , video or games  .

it's meant to be used for 24p film sources  .

and let me make it clear that thx is as adjustable as the other modes  .

it can be brightened and the color can be modified  .

i recommend using the warm 1 setting instead of the one cnet says  .

warm2 is too green  .

lastly thx is not meant to be used in lit rooms  .

it's intended for movie watching in the dark room if you want a a picture comparable to thx mode but with more light output , i recommend using the custom mode and applying the settings cnet uses for that mode   http  //forums  .

i noticed some on youtube are posting videos of so    called phosphorous lag with this set  .

i noticed this too but it's extremely subtle and is difficult to recreate unless you make a point to try to  .

the only time i can see it is when i quickly look away from the tv    but who the hell watches tv like that  .

in every way this is the ultimate tv for this price range  .

ignore the noise and go for it .

paid $1299 from best buy and the picture makes hdtv and games as crisp and vibrant as i've seen on any tv to date  .

my friend has a kuro and honestly between the two i could not pick a winner for best picture so i'd have to go for best price , panasonic ftw  .

i bought this television besause i watch a lot of movies and play games , i also pefer plasmas over lcds  .

but i am disappionted that you cannot adjust the 600hz subfield drive so you can see the difference with it on or off like you can with lcds .

i bought this tv in december 2009 (and i am amazed the price has yet to drop  .

) after discovering lcd's really hurt my eyes  .

i now have to fight from becoming a couch potato with all the tv programs in hdtv and the blu ray movie releases  .

i have not seen a drop in black levels as claimed by some and i do like to watch movies in thx (i find the picture more like a movie theatre)  .

as i stated in the cons , the whites vibrate at times and sometimes the motion blur when watching blu ray discs makes me nauseous (i noticed motion blur in movie theaters too , but perhaps it's just intensified on a small screen)  .

yes i would buy this hdtv again  .

i almost purchased this plasma , but hesitated  .

however , i'm glad i did  .

within my 3 day wait , the less expensive on    line retailers went out of stock of this tv  .

it appears that it is being discontinued , and replaced with the tc    p50g15  .

the g15 is about 2 thinner and has an extra anti    glare coating  .

other than that , identical i found the g15 for a slightly less price than the best g10 price i ever found on    line , at a local video only store  .

the lg bd390 is also cheaper there as well .

this is a great tv  .

now that pioneer is not making hdtvs any longer , this makes panasonic the flat    panel hdtv company to beat  .

and for good reason .

bottom line in thx mode to get rid of green tint , use cnets custom settings and enable c  .

looks the same as thx exept without the tint , also i dropped the color down to 38 instead of 40 looks perfect  .

more than enough picture light in a low lit room , it does not have to be pitch black , i still scwint at bright scenes  .

this is a great t  .

i looked hard at samsung , lg , visio , if u need cinamatic quality this is the t  .

for standard dvds u can go with a great upscaler like oppo and blow away all aspects of any other brand plasma .

i see this tv everyday when i go to work and all i can say about it is that it has amazing blacks , great motion this is a mid range model people don't be expecting gold , the color is not as good as lcd but great price for what you get by the way thx is garbage unless you have it in a low light setting (turns all the whites to tan) kind of nasty looking in normal light (like cnets lab)  .

all in all jack of all trades but really its a master of none  .

if you want a great tv and you do not bother too much with cash i would wait for the v10 or the z1 if your big balln , heck the led sammys look rather nice  .

but if your like most and want to try and pay some bills too then this mid level pana certainly has a great well rounded package oh and if your in chattanooga come buy it from me matt at sears hamilton place  .

updated  .

on aug 30 , 2009  .

i is thinking about buying this set , then i walked into best buy and they had this up with higher priced lcd's (samsung and sony) , as well as the other plasma i is looking at (samsung pn50b550) and this set looked every bit as good as those higher priced lcd's ($2400+)and totally beat the samsung  .

plus it has features they do not have  .

as far as the green tint you may have read about , it is very slight , and as stated above , you have to try to look for it  .

thx mode needs a dark room to shine as it is not intended for a bright room , but turn the lights out and be amazed some reviewers knock the panasonics for not having a ton of picture settings , well this set has as many as i need , as i am not going to fret and fuss over getting the picture right for every different thing i may watch , i have a life  .

it doesnt have a lot of settings because it does not need a lot of settings , and the remote is not one you have to spend a day to learn how to use , it does what you need it to do , simply bottom line , if you are like me , and moneys tight  .

but you want great value for a great price , look at this set  .

my wife did not want to get this set , but after she saw what it could do , we went out and bought a blu    ray player two days later .

my review , or blog , is about a panasonic g10 plasma but it starts with a vizio  .

i purchased my 50 inch vizio vp505xvt after reading a lot of outstanding reviews from every respectable hdtv critic (cnet , hdguru , pcmag , ultimateavmag  .

com)  .

one of my favorite review quotes comes from cnet ,  .

simply put , the vizio vp505xvt is one of the better    performing plasma tvs we've tested this year from any manufacturer  .

that said it all , i is sold , and i  .

m getting a 505xvt  .

the set retailed for $1599  .

99 at the time but costco is selling it for $1199  .

i ran over to my local costco at pentagon city in arlington va and purchased it  .

for the next 85 days i loved the set  .

my one complaint is the image retention (ir) , i followed the 100 hour break    in rule but found that even after the 100 hours , i still had constant ir  .

nothing permanent , the ir would typically fade after 20 minutes to an hour of full screen programming  .

but it is a chore , constantly having to combat the ir and always trying to prevent it  .

i wanted a plasma though , lcd shortcoming were not acceptable to me i decided to replace my visio with a brand new 2009 g10 , i figured i would lose nothing  .

costco has a no questions asked 90 day return policy , so i exercised it  .

vizio  .

s flagship , top    of    the    line plasma should be equal to panny  .

s middle    of    the    road plasma , right  .

and for the most part they are similar  .

black levels , to my eye , are no different , both produce incredibly inky blacks but small things existed on the visio that didn  .

t on the panny  .

what might those be you ask  .

1080p    over    component  .

to my dismay , i plugged up my x    box 360 to my new g10 and no picture  .

after fumbling around with the component cables , i learned of the g10  .

s shortcoming  .

i remembered setting my x    box to 1080p as a test on the vizio and it worked to my surprise  .

i assumed 1080p    over    component is only a feature on the most high end hdtv so i is quite happy to find it available on my vizio plasma for $1199  .

i purchased the g10 for $1499  .

99 but at the time its msrp is $1999  .

surely a tv as expensive at that would include a feature found on a cheaper , budget brand television  .

nope , i learned that vizio and samsung include 1080p    over    component on all there 1080p sets now  .

i guess i am just stuck with 1080i for my x    box my other gripe with the panasonic g10 is it  .

s ability to scale an interlaced image to the native progressive display  .

for most channels i receive over my directv satellite service it works okay , but a few channels , namely discovery hd theater , the very top of the screen is not filled with the picture  .

kind of like a 2cm letterbox , but it doesn  .

t exist on the bottom of the picture , only the top  .

i know for a fact the vizio didn  .

t do this  .

i used discovery hd theater for my plasma breaking period , because of the channels lack of a permanent channel logo and the 100% full screen hd programming  .

to combat this issue i used the overscan picture setting while breaking in my g10 but this is a nuisance to me  .

why doesn  .

t it scale correctly , and why does tnthd scale perfectly  .

i know the vizio vp505xvt has a higher end video processor than the panny  .

the benefit is   better scaling and de    interlacing of all non    1080p content  .

the sd picture quality of the 505xvt is noticeably better than on the g10 my last complaint for the g10 is the menu and remote  .

there is no quick way to change picture presets  .

i use a brighter picture present (custom) for daytime viewing and sporting events and thx mode for nighttime viewing and movies  .

this switch requires me to go multiple clicks into the menu , while the visio had a dedicated button  .

also no universal remote for the panny , it only controls the tv (unless you have special panasonic brand accessories and use vieralink)  .

this is easily looked past if you have a logitech harmony remote , which it do , but the omission puzzles me now this is not a blog to trump the panasonic g10  .

i do enjoy the hd picture  .

i have directv so i watch 95% hd content  .

the g10 design so pretty  .

i love the television but if i can do it again , i wouldn  .

t have traded returned my vizio  .

to me , the 505xvt performs equal to the high standards set by the g10 , and even surpasses it in features (hqv video processing , 1080p    over    component , srs surround sound w/ dts decoding , better menu and immensely more robust picture control)  .

the only thing i find the panasonic offers that the visio doesn  .

t is   better anti    image retention and vieracast internet services  .

sure thx mode is there but it isn  .

t all that it is cracked up to be  .

the casual tv watcher would probably prefer a non    thx preset due to the dim contrast presented in thx mode  .

most people would be 100% happy with the beautiful panasonic g10 , as i mostly am , but believe it is a slight downgrade from the vizio vp505xvt  .

now if i never purchased the vizio first , i would give the g10 five stars  .

it just sucks when you pay more money and lose features updated  .

on may 10 , 2009  .

i got interested in this new model as its time for me to get rid of my bulky projection and i want a nicely designed flat display (after all it is part of the room overall look) that does not compormise on the picture quality  .

started to look still last year and is thinking about pioneer or panasonic pz800 or 850  .

liked more pioneer simple design and is a little concerned about some issues (like with 24p) on panasonic but pioneer is significantly costier  .

then pioneer closed the doors and who wants to own product that vendor does not produce anymore  .

now here is new g10  .

cnet review looks great , model seems upgraded compare to very good pz800 and 850  .

went to the store to take a look  .

and spend some time watching (and even playing with some settings) g10 , two other panasonic cheaper models , one samsung and pioneer 2050pdp all hanging side by side on the wall  .

i can not say i is greatly impressed by superior quality of g10  .

actually , they all were pretty close but the best (to my certain disappointment) is still pioneer  .

not just the blacks were a little blacker , thats not a big deal , but the picture is somewhat smoother and more pleasant to eye  .

g10 in normal mode is slighly more harsh to me  .

and switching to thx mode showed that it is noticably dimmer  .

i guess you can get used to it but really should you  .

what about more bright room than a store  .

and color accuracy and gamma , etc , all important but what about just general 'watchability  .

it looked to me just too dim  .

i guess if you reduce brightness and contrast as much as possible then some cheap daewoo also can display accurate colors  .

i need both , that is acceptable brightness and contrast too  .

but another thing i noticed is a certain graininess in some images , particular on broadcasts  .

i would think its my imagination or some miscalibration if not remembering some others comments on it here on cnet from some people  .

i spent good deal of time trying to figure out if it is really there  .

i dont want to make statments , its hard to tell for sure on quickly changing images but i had a feeling that in some cases (like moving camera over green football field) i had an impression that g10 showed more grains than other displays (including other panasonics)  .

looking closely it appeared like sort of pixellation on highly contrasted moving fields (again , green grass , tree leaves , etc  .

cartoons were just fine , cant say for sure about film material , but broadcasts gave me this feeling  .

not so other displays  .

i dont know what else to say about it  .

cnet review does not mention anything like that  .

did they miss it  .

or still my imagination  .

and i dont accept this talk about how much better g10 resolves images to the grain show better than on worse resolving displays    i do not care why i have a problem , i just want not to have it  .

so watch carefully with this model if you decide to buy    test it yourself  .

as to myself i think either wait till june for v10 model or just buy pioneer while i can and the heck with it    from what i see its still the best performer  .

hopefully it will not break for couple of years and then there will even better technology .

i have this tv for 4 months  .

first the blacks were black now it's turning more like a dark gray than a deep black  .

will panasonic take care of this  .

does anybody knows  .

i do think this is the best plasma screen on the market unless you want to step up to the elite series  .

bummer that pioneer discontinued kuro .

this is my first flat screen , so no previous  .

flat  .

experience to compare to  .

i confess to a predilection for the sony product  .

my previous tv is a sony v    class tube tv which had a great picture many one    click features such as on    screen tvguide , sleep timer and well    placed buttons (grouped by frequency of use)  .

it could also control other devices but i couldn't afford the xbr6 series so i had to hunt for the best bang    for    my    budget  .

knowing that i would be stuck with my choice for many years (if my choice is reliable) and being an analytical type , i spent many an hour scanning the web looking at specifications , learning hdtv principles , reading reviews and standing in front of a lot of lcd and plasma tvs including the pioneer kuro (not that i could afford it)  .

cnet reviews helped me narrow the field to this panasonic g10 series , but i could not afford the 50 inch model until best buy put it on sale during july 4th weekend ($1300  .

) unfortunately , the on    screen user interface leaves is less than fun  .

it gets the job done , but not elegantly  .

except for vieracast , everything is displayed in numbers and letters , when it could show channel icons  .

the screen is large enough to present all 30 favorites at one time , but only 10 are presented at a time , but no icons  .

then you have to scroll down (first move your finger to a different part of the remote) until you get to the channel of choice , or punch an oversized digit key  .

most commonly    used buttons should be adjacent but are not too many clicks to get to specific favorite channel , sleep timer and other features  .

wish it had on screen tvguide (like rovi liquid  .

) wish it had a variable audio output (to control)  .

i do not have a blu    ray player so i can  .

t tell how 1080p looks but 1080i channels from my cable provider are great for the $$ this is a great deal  .

i just wish the user interface were more efficient and fun .

opted not to buy this set in favor of a samsung 55 inch lcd  .

i is all set to buy this tv after doing extensive reviews  .

i went to the store with checkbook in hand ready to buy  .

i was not even considering anything else until i saw it next to several other sets  .

this set appeared very dim compared to sony and samsung lcd sets  .

i cranked the brightness up to 10 , tried thx mode , tried game mode , etc  .

nothing seemed to help  .

i went to both sears and best buy , both sets had the same issues  .

i just could not bring myself to plunk down all that money for what i thought is a dim picture  .

i am sure the set must have many pros to be rated so highly , but the color , clarity and vibrancy of other sets , the 55 inch samsung lcd in particular , blew this set away  .

best advice , go into several stores and look at the picture before settling on one  .

the reviews of this set are awesome , but to me , the picture is very dark and dim .

took a lot of tweeking to produce an aceptable image  .

i is very disapointed with the color acuracy  .

thx on this set is useless  .

i is able to get a much better picture on the standard setting with a good deal of tweeking over several days  .

sending the set back and hoping for a better result with the v10 series  .

wish i had a kuro updated  .

on apr 20 , 2009  .

wait until you see a review of the 50  .

i'm sorry , but i've seen the pioneer 5020 and this tv side    by    side , and this one does not cut it  .

to start , thx mode is too dim and washed    out  .

second , the set presents an unpleasant green cast to skin    tones .

great solid tv , i would consider owning one however all panasonic that i have seen , s1/2 , c1/2 , x1/2 and g10 are all ungodly grainy  .

grainy to the nth degree  .

let me paint a picture  .

i is watching iron man on an s1 with a samsung blu    ray player  .

i is roughly 5    6 ft away and noticed how grainy the picture was  .

i stepped back to about 12 ft and still could see it  .

thinking it is just that particular tv i switched it to the g10 my store has and same thing  .

thinking it had to be the disk since panasonics are so highly regarded i switched it to a pos lg lh90 and low and behold no more grainy  .

then i switched to the pn50b850 and holy    .

greatest picture ever we have since moved the iron man blu    ray to a un55c6500 and still no more grainy  .

out of curiosity we put it on the new s2 and c2 and still grainy  .

i do like the panasonics , do not get me wrong , but i'm at a loss as to why people think so highly of the panasonics  .

for the size and money the samsung 8 series plasma's are leaps and bounds better in my opinion .

disappointment after 400 hours black looks grey 01/19/2010  .

by magdielito from lorain ohio  .

picture quality3  .

sound quality3  .

features3  .

what's great about it   is a nice tv but after 400 hours of use the blacks look like a old lcd  .

what's not so great   black after 400 hours  .

panasonic is good company however this tv is suffering a black level changes after 400 hours making the tv look like a old lcd tv a tech replace the a    board but still with the problem lest hope a firmware fix this issue  .

not an out of the box product for an hdtv newbie  .

i will admit , this is the first tv of it's kind that i have owned and i have only owned it for 6 days  .

although y review may be pre    mature it is my opinion based on my $1 , 300 i spent based on online reviews only  .

i figured if the world likes it this much , it must be good  .

well i just warn everyone to read all the pros and all the cons on all websites (google is your friend) i must say i made my purchase prematurely and got a tad excited over my wife's approval to let me get rid of my sony 53 rear projection  .

i bought eagerly based on internet reviews but to be honest , i guess i only looked at the number of star ratings and looked at some of the main cons (dim and green thx mode and 'weak' internal speakers) these are definately items to consider  .

however , there are other reviews and recommended picture settings for various (thx , custom) modes on other websites that do offer some valuable information to help the visuals a bit once again , i admit to being an hdtv and plasma newbie but i do know that when i walk into my local bestbuy or even walmart for that matter and i see and hear a store display that blows my system out of the water during the first 6 days of ownership , it is a little disappointing they're typical store setups with just your in    store array of electronics , usually attached to a samsung $300 home theater system setup whereas i'm running with an nad t744 receiver , paradigm center channel , sub and surrounds , samsung bd    p1590 bluray player , all monster cable hdmi , the works to watch any media from my input device of choice , i tend to be most happy in the preset game mode in order to get the brightness and clarity i desire from comparible store displays (and this is considering the amount of ambient and natural lighting in most stores)  .

bottom line    i truly beleive that perhaps an earlier firmware version may have justified the earlier reviews  .

i updated my firmware upon initial setup and i tell ya    thx mode and out of box do not go hand in hand  .

as others say , it is terribly dim with an extremely green tint and the internal speakers , even at a really low volume level are nothing less than totally worthless admittedly , once again a plasma newbie , but it is still $1 , 300 i parted with i just expected more  .

having an audiophile friend and at least somewhat of an eye and ear for good sound and quality products i feel my opinion should be at least be valuable to some    the common consumer looking for a good buy call me a jerk (no pun intended) and excuse my bad analogy , but like steve martin once said    .

you would think that in a fancy restaurant at these prices you could keep the snails off the food  .

there are so many snails there you cannot even see the food  .

now take those away and bring us those melted cheese sandwich appetizers you talked me out of  .

i want my toasted cheese appetizers back updated  .

on jul 28 , 2009  .

i called panasonic and scheduled a house call  .

when the day came , the technician said there is a bad circuit board , and he had just used up his only spare on another job the day before he said the new one would take about a week to come in at which time he would call  .

a couple of days later we received a 42    inch lcd loaner while ours is awaiting parts    we found out why a loaner is needed  .

oh , by the way , the plasma's picture really does look better  .

three weeks later , still no part so i checked the status of my repair online  .

my case number search turned up nothing  .

no record of that repair  .

so i called panasonic and spent the usual amount of time on hold that people always seem to encounter from the reviews i've read  .

i finally got one of the lower tier reps  .

he said that my part is showing as back    ordered , but had no estimated delivery date or any other information  .

he put me back on hold after apologizing for doing that  .

when he came back on he said that he is going to transfer me to their viera concierge service as they would have more information  .

oh    oh i've been handed off like this before and it usually means someone screwed up  .

this concierge person comes on the phone and tells me that i don't have the part because the technician reported the repair complete  .

excuse me  .

didn't the first rep just tell me their computer showed the part still back    ordered (strike 1)  .

she also said that she had called me on the 26th of august (this is the 1st of september) to inquire about my satisfaction with the repair  .

i told her that no one had called from panasonic or left a message on my answering machine  .

she assured me she had  .

my caller id says she didn't (strike 2 for careless fibbing)  .

after all this she told me the computer showed my circuit board as still being on back order with no expected arrival date  .

didn't she just tell me the computer showed my repair as being complete , now which story is she going to run with (strike    3)  .

i mentioned that panasonic might consider deepening their pool of spare parts and she told me that they don't carry spare parts ; they just order them as they fail  .

see sentence number 2  .

either she is mistaken or the repair technician is mistaken when he said he carried spare boards  .

i think everyone at panasonic ought to huddle together and get their stories straightened out  .

service and support are an integral part of any product  .

their service just does not make me want to buy panasonic in the future .

i have no idea why this product is rated so highly  .

i read extensively so many glowing reviews on this tv  .

if you are fan of artificial looking colors and crazy deep black levels that make everything you view look dim this is the tv for you  .

look around your room how many areas in the room are so dark it looks like you are looking into a black hole  .

none right  .

well this tv is so black in most of the darker areas that it is just annoying  .

there is usually nuance in black levels you won't find that with this tv  .

and the colors are just freaky out of this world colors you cannot make anything you watch on this tv look normal  .

i like natural looking video call me crazy  .

you wo not get it with this tv  .

no matter how you try to adjust it .

i spent a lot of time looking at reviews for this unit  .

nearly everyone stated just how good the picture is  .

so , i bought one based on those reviews and i am here to tell you my samsung 780p set blows this thing away  .

the thx mode is dark with little contrast and just not what i expected  .

contrast is pegged at 100 in all modes so there is nothing more than can be tweaked the vivid mode is not bad but color gets too bright on some stations  .

screen formatting is a pain in the beehind since not every station on comcast seems to have a different format remote is ok and backlit overal , i am disappointed with the plasma .

blows all panasonic tv's out the water even the weak g10 , this tv color accuracy is so amazing , with its deep blacks and whites it produces  .

i had a panasonic and is disappointed in its inaccurate flesh tone and washed out deep blacks , that i sold it to get this samsung b650  .

panasonic is still a good company for mediocre people but my vizio tv i had looked ten times better than that panasonic model  .

samsung has the best plasma out this year , sorry panasonic  .

is a good tv , heard it make a sound like the screen cracked in half 3 times during a 3 month period , soon after tv went out .

this t  .

is great for 6 months only  .

they have the worst customer service  .

so unless you have money to burn on a new t  .

v after 6 months don't but it  .

our t  .

v has been down for 7 weeks almost every part replaced still more parts on back order for another 4 weeks  .

we told them we want out give us a refund so they told us to fax a copy of receipt surprise it did not work we had to call 4 days before we could get anyone to verify # they have 5 fax #s and they all have been down for the past week  .

we had to give all our info to they 4 times they kept mixing up with other customers  .

we finely had the repair shop (very helpful) to call the panasonic rep  .

all they will give us is the sales price so we are out more than $130 in sales tax and out $300 for the calibration  .

we will never buy anything panasonic .
