3 quot  widescreen display was a bonus .
Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .
The bad ,  My unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .
It also can display and speak many languages .
The Garmin has a nice 3d display .
The 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the arrow .
Well when I saw that the 255W had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner I jumped at it .
The 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit .
Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .
But is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .
I have checked the display in three areas I am familiar with :
Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .
So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays .
The display is great, and is very clear .
Even setting the display to maximum detail is far from adequate .
The unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .
One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .
The 255W has a really clear display that's easy to see in any light .
UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .
For me, the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .
