we have always found the staff on the front desk , at breakfast and in the bar to be very friendly and helpful and this visit was no exception .
free tea , coffee and biscuits along with a couple of computers and newspapers are available in the comfortable lounge area on the ground floor .
room had a queen sized bed with bedside tables , a wardrobe with reasonably sized safe , a desk with chair , tv and bar fridge with free soft drinks and two good alcoves under the windows to store bags .
on this occasion we had a reasonably sized room on the third floor looking out onto other buildings but this was ok as we were hardly in the room .
parking is provided in a garage opposite the hotel and staff always valet park your car .
package , booked on the hotel 's website , included parking - always a bonus in large cities .
they also have a very good aperitivi in the bar in the evenings .
some additional hot dishes or a change in variety would definitely enhance , what is already a very good , breakfast experience .
one of the features that attracts us to the berna is its closeness to the metro , with the entrance to the metro about 150 metres away at the end of the street .
room and bathroom were very clean and the free wifi was excellent .
