It's loaded with useful features .
Smooth OS with great little features .
It does have some nice features .
They're features I don't use .
,  Many features are copied from Mac OS X
,  New features with better window and file managment
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features .
Runs well, but no stand out new features for my usage .
Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .
And I love all the new Aero Shake Peek Snap windows features, but I still prefer Mac OS X's Expose .
