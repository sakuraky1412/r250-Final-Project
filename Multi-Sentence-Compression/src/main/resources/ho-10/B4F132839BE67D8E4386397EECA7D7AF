only flaws ( versus other kimptons ) : ( 1 ) the keurig coffee maker was not 'restocked ' by housekeeping ( other kimptons do restock , and will use liquid coffeemate singles not the cheap powdered creamer , some kimptons also give free bottled water with the coffee maker - the muse does not of this ) .
( if you find this review helpful , please click 'thanks ' below - it helps me know people read these and its worth taking the time to write them ) .
located just steps from the madness and touristy kitschy capital that is times square , this hotel provides that boutique , personal feel that kimpton has become so good at .
these are minor issues - ultimately you chose a hotel you a ) can get a good night 's sleep in , and b ) feel like you get your moneys worth - usual through a perception of value and a service orientated staff .
sleep comfort was very good , and the noise and lights of ts could not be heard in our room .
i 'll leave you the surprise - but its these sorts of things that really help this hotel separate itself from the crowd .
the adjoining bar / restaurant to the lobby was used by use for breakfast one day ( excellent ) and drinks in the evening .
( 2 ) the a/c unit could not be put on 'low ' fan - it would keep resetting to auto , so it would turn off / on during the night ( room 714 ) .
easy walking distance to much that midtown has to offer - only a few blocks from ts , rockerfeller centre , bryant park , the ny public library , multiple subway stations and lines , and a 10 block walk to central park .
the staff was excellent - the female manager even called me by name on a regular basis - very impressive and a classy touch .
