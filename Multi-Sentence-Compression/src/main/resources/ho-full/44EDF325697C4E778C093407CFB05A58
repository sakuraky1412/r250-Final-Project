we stayed for several nights in mid-april .
the hotel was not yet fully operational for the season and maintenance was going on - for example , there was no air conditioning in the room we stayed in , which was troublesome for two nights as it was quite hot and stuffy .
we were not informed of this prior to arriving .
we had a room overlooking the sea and the view was lovely .
but , the room was rather dated , the furniture had seen better days , bed mattress was extremely hard and the linens were rough and old .
having stayed in the raffles in istanbul prior to the kempinski the difference in '5 star ' quality was alarming .
the kempinski really needs to overhaul the hotel infrastructure comprehensively to realistically call this a '5 star hotel ' .
good points - the swimming pool area is great , the beach was clean and the hotel staff were courteous and efficient - and do try their best to give a 5 star service .
the breakfast and dinner staff were particularly good .
but beware , the wine list was one of the most overpriced i have ever seen - taxes on wine in turkey are high , obviously to dissuade drinking , however this does no favors to the emerging turkish wine producers - there are some good wines but i doubt many will drink them .
would we return , for the staff yes , for the hotel no .
it no longer reflects the 5 . . .
