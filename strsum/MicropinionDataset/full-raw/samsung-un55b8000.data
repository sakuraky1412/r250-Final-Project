excellent tv , everyone who comes over to my house is asking me how did i get picture like that  .
its expansive but hey~  .
you get what you pay for  .
i love the tv , i am very happy with it , not sure if i bought it too soon while 3d is coming now but really dont want to sit at home wearing glasses either  .
price is fairly low , bought it in jan at amazon  .
i have not had any problems with it  .
i am so impressed with the samsung after 2 weeks of use  .
even standard non    hd cable looks good  .
it looks better in my house than the store feed  .
the embeded content (scenery , art , games , recipies , relaxing image sounds) is cool for a demo , but not expected to be used too much  .
i have not hooked it to the internet yet as i need either a 50' lan cable or the $79 wireless adapter  .
i will order the cable today  .
no bluray yet , but i watched hd    on    demand last night and it is sooo impresive  .
no buyer remorse here  .
go get yours  .
i ended up finding the best price here   http  //shop  .
rose    press  .
com/samsung    un55b8000    55    inch    1080p    240    hz    led    hdtv  .
ok , my husband reads the manuals etc  .
then he breaks them down in english for me  .
we have only had our led for 3 days , so he is still working everything out  .
he has managed to hook the led to the internet wirelessly  .
he is like a little kid in the candy shop  .
he is loving all of the features that come with the tv  .
i will give it a week or so before i start to learn everything that there is  .
we are also planning on watching the super bowl on the led  .
i cant wait , we will be able to see every little thing on there  .
when we bought our led , we also got a free blue    ray player with it  .
great deal at best buy for the super bowl  .
we also cant wait til we buy the second one within the next month  .
same size and series it also sucks that the cable company cannot handle the power that this tv offers  .
the led is so advanced compared to cable etc picture    beautiful  .
quality    beautiful  .
functions    awesome  .
issues that i have    i can not get the led to myself  .
my husband keeps playing with it  .
i keep telling myself , it will be over soon , let him have his fun the best tv we have ever owned  .
it is like a piece of art  .
i would recommend this product to anyone .
if your out of the us  .
i suggest acquiring this set with no regrets  .
i have owned sony televisions exclusively for the past 30 years  .
i is in the market for a new tv to replace my older sony 50 grand wega lcd projection set  .
i always keep up with new technologies in consumer electronics and knew that led backlighting is the way to go  .
one day , i visited best buy to see the new sony models  .
i is particularly interested in the sony bravia xbr8 led tv  .
it has an awesome display , but i couldn't bring myself to part with $5k for a tv  .
the price factor is a big disappointment  .
i knew samsung made led models so i decided to check them out too  .
i is immediately floored  .
they looked far better than sony's more expensive led model and for $2k less  .
but , is i really willing to purchase something other than a sony tv  .
i would have to be convinced  .
i did a lot of research on these samsung sets  .
i demoed them in several stores and read as many reviews as possible  .
imo , the samsung led tvs are by far the best technology currently available  .
their display must be seen to be believed  .
most impressive of all , is the fact that samsung accomplished this in a set that is only 1  .
2 thick well , i is finally convinced and decided to purchase the samsung un55b8000  .
i have owned it for almost a month now and i am in awe every time i watch it  .
this set is beautiful even when it's turned off  .
but , you won't want to turn it off because the clarity , detail , brightness , contrast and color are absolutely exceptional  .
for the first time i have owned a tv , i did not have to make any adjustments to the factory settings    it looked perfect right out of the box  .
in fact , i had purchased a calibration dvd and is surprised to find that i didn't have to make any adjustment to any controls of course , the most amazing thing about his set and what intially lured me to it is its picture quality  .
it's difficult to explain the level of detail it produces  .
i have hd cable programming (1080i) , which looks fantastic  .
games on the xbox 360 pops out at you  .
but the images produced from a blu    ray source is absolutely breath    taking  .
i is also pleasantly surprised at how bright the display looks in my sunlit family room  .
i thought i would have to adjust the brightness to view the set in daylight and again when watching at night as i did with our old sony tv  .
although the screen on the un55b8000 has a gloss finish , it does a great job of reducing glare and reflections i do want to respond to the negative comments that others have reported here regarding uneven backlighting or vignetting effect caused by the edge    lit leds when the tv displays dark images  .
the only time i noticed this is when the set displays a totally black background such as in movie credits  .
at best , it appears as a very faint illumination from the corner  .
but even then , i really had to look for it  .
i do not think this is an issue at all ; at least not one that should deter anyone from purchasing this incredible tv  .
i have to assume that those that have experienced this anomaly are probably looking at an uncalibrated set that has its brightness level turned way too high i took advantage of the slim design of this set and purchased the ultra slim wall mount  .
the tv hangs like a picture frame and looks like a masterpiece , which it is  .
the slim case houses adequate speakers , producing fairly good sound quality for normal tv viewing  .
of course , you would want to watch movies through a surround sound system as for the other features of this set ; the internet widgets are pretty cool  .
i especially like the youtube widget  .
the dlna network feature is also a nice addition , but the interface is somewhat slow and not very functional  .
i'm hoping that a future firmware upgrade would improve this feature  .
the content library feature is my favorite  .
it allows you to display a slideshow of artwork or other pics with soft background music    great for parties  .
you can download additional content for free from samsung i am extremely pleased with this television and would recommend it to anyone .
1/7/2010  .
just bought this product before start of new year at fry's  .
i've been wanting to get the samsung 55 8000 series but it is way too expensive when it came out  .
before new year 2010 fry's put it on sale reducing the original price by $900 and i immediately bought it  .
this is my very first hdtv  .
the previous tv i had is a 32 sony crt and i had that tv for 16 years and it's still good       )  .
but the samsung un55b8000 is just amazing  .
the picture quality is oustanding  .
the picture is just so bright and flesh tones are so realistic (and this with standard settings)  .
i have the tv paired to my hdtv    dvr cable receiver and the hdtv programs come out looking very good  .
for playing movies i use my ps3       ) which i also use for gaming  .
gaming is really improved because i can now see details that i couldn't see from y 32 sony crt tv  .
all connections are via hdmi cables i've read the cnet reviews and do not really understand the tech stuff  .
all i can say is that this tv is amazing and i am so glad i bought this samsung tv  .
i heard the series 9000 will be out august 2010 so you just have to draw the line somewhere and buy  .
with 5 , 000 , 000    1 contrast ratio , 240hz auto motion and thin form factor , and 55 screen size , what more would you want  .
this hdtv is the best and i'm really satisifed with the purchase  .
also i'm glad i purchased the 55 screen size and not the 46 screen size  .
it really does make a lot of difference       )  .
i had a really expensive $2000 sony 3lcd rear projection tv  .
its about 4 years old now (@ $2000 dollars that is a really good price too during this time)  .
it is 720p/1080i  .
i thought it is a pretty good unit  .
pictures looked pretty good  .
nice 50 inch tv  .
then i bought this 55inch samsung  .
and i have to say that i am stunned at the how big a difference it is from this tv to my old tv  .
my old tv compares favorably to some of the cheaper lcds on the market  .
but pales in comparison to the beautiful picture the un55b8000 puts out  .
i is also considering the un55b8500 , but i dont think the diffence between the two justifies the $1000 price difference  .
i is floored by the picture quality , disappointed by the lack of built in wifi , but overall very happy with this great tv .
worth the big money  .
i did a lot or research in purchasing a lcd/ led , or plasma and for this to be the best purchase for me  .
the picture is incredible  .
i find my self watching some shows i would not normally watch but i keep looking at the intimite detail which is generated by this tv  .
on a full black screen you may notice the edge lighting but to me it is minimal and that is the only time i have noticed this complaint by the other reviewers i purchsed the hd essentials blue ray disc for proper set of the color/ contrast/ etc  .
and i highly recommend this disc  .
the easy to follow steps make it possible to change the tv settings to true color , picture etc  .
from the factory settings and get a true representation of the natural colors  .
i believe best buy charges $300 for this service but save yourself the money i have had no issues with the quality of the picture in any way  .
i have not tried all the yahoo widgets yet but i will attest the process does appear slow  .
the set is only 1  .
2 thick so if space is an issue this set fits the bill  .
it is so thin it has the appearance of being a picture minus the cords the only real negative comments i read were about nonfunctioning sets or the results of power surgers  .
i personally purchased the in store extended warranty on the set and i would recommend anyone else doing the same  .
it cost me $400 for the service but the set costing me $2300 , i though is was a good idea  .
i don't always purchase these extended warranties but to remove the stress of a potential problem , i did i channel the audio through my reciever and use a number of components with my set and i do not really find a need for the little remote which comes with the set  .
the other remote is back lite and seems to light up just sitting there overall i highly recommend this led for purchase  .
the picture is amazing , the set is artfully designed , and the setups are easy .
sears delivered this tv this morning and it's nothing short of outstanding in almost every respect  .
i is seriously considering this tv and the panasonic tc    p58v10  .
i spent many hours of research on each model  .
both had strong suits and great reviews , but i chose the samsung un55b8000  .
my final decision is made based on the fact that the samsung led lcd had a superior contrast ratio  .
and i'm now convinced it is the right decision  .
the only distraction is a slight glare reflection from the screen but other than that , it delivers the best picture available  .
the wireless widget access is also more convenient than an ethernet connection  .
in conclusion , there's no buyers remorse here  .
this tv rocks  .
more expensive than than same size but 120 hz peers but it is worth to additional money  .
compare to its sony counter part , this is a bargain .
i just got the tv this last weekend and only had a few hours to play with it before i had to head out of town again  .
the picture quality blew away any other tv i have ever looked at before  .
i am still learning all the tricks this tv has to offer and will do more exploring once i get back home  .
do some research and i'm confident you will lead yourself back to this tv .
outstanding picture  .
i have the un55b8000xf model  .
this model upgrades the picture from the directv  .
everyone who has seen the picture freaks out  .
outastanding tv .
in the showroom we spotted out the samsung led tvs compared to all of the other plasmas and lcds there  .
they seems to have greater color dynamics than most other sets .
really is the best led tv on the market for its price as of now .
i absolutely love this tv even with its flaws  .
let me tell you as for styling it is the best for the money  .
i got my tv for 1800 at bestbuy with 299 insurance open box purchase  .
the picture is amazing    and when i hook up to my mac via hdmi there is no blooming the black is black all the way through  .
watching hd movies through itunes quantum is amazing in movie mode  .
mac works great get the hdmi converter and 3  .
5 plug put it into hdmi 1 and the audio it works all together perfect 1080p at either 24hz , 30hz or 60hz internet is slow but fine  .
i also stream my own music , photo , and videos through this tv a little slow but works great speakers are tinny so what i did is hook via optical out to my stereo which makes it amazing remote sucks but get a univeral logitech remote to control everything but having trouble as i change sources to remove that sidebar after overall amazed at the color clarity of this tv love the picture like hanging option and wireless option for internet  .
this tv has it all style and performance  .
i did my research looked at panasonic 55v10 and lg 60ps80 and sharp and sony xbr    but for the money and style this is the best and it weighs less than 60 lbs i can pick it up myself you cant do that with the rest of the tv unless it cost more than $4000 open box item is almost perfect missing manual and two rubber feet which i easily replaced by home depot felt  .
no scratches anywhere and stand is solid and no scratches  .
nice that you can move it around , but really thinking of mounting on wall but at angles you need to move tv content internet is amazing on this tv you can play bowling , learn to cook , origami for the kids , picture showing it is freaking amazing i do not work for samsung  .
i love technology never written for any product until now  .
i am 42 and live life large and in nyc  .
very successful and live in trump  .
i ran a large it dept and always follow technology for the last 10 years .
purchased this tv 2 weeks ago from best buy  .
i can honestly say that i have never seen a clearer more defined picture  .
correct that in hd  .
in standard definition that picture is just ok  .
but hd and blu ray pictures are stunning and have a lifelike 3    d effect  .
i find myself watching movies i do not even like just because the picture is so clear  .
my wife is sick and tired of me commenting on how beautiful this picture is  .
the blacks are as deep as any plasma i have seen and the picture is brighter now for the bad as others have reported there are small dark patches in each corner  .
it is minor but they can be distracting once you know they are there  .
also i think it is a waste to include artwork , childrens songs , and slow playing games built into the tv  .
maybe that's my opinion but i bought this beauty to watch tv samsung also missed the boat with the 2 remote controls  .
they only operate the tv and i use a reciever for sound and a dvr to change chanels so to me they pretty useless  .
it would have been nice if they were programable now that i'm done complaining i would just like to say that i would choose this tv again in a heartbeat  .
the picture just cannot be beat  .
coming from a 60 inch mitsubishi rear projection monstrosity so pleased with space saving and pic quality  .
all in one remote sold by best buy is outstanding and simple to use  .
it literally tells you what to do .
all in all i likethis tv for wat is worh there are picture draw back but if you can look past those [wich are minor btw] youl be satisfied easly  .
awesome tv but the $250 wall mount they sell , when used they way they designed it , where you prop it out from the wall to connect the cables , the mounting disks tear up the back of the tv , and as far as the outer frame case scratches  .
i can see the swirls and hairline scratches (spots where i wiped finger prints off with wet blue satin cleaning cloth they provided) from the sofa 18 feet away  .
it's distressing  .
i have an open case with samsung executive customer service to do something about it  .
there's something seriously wrong in the plastic they use or something cuz i've never had a computer or anything (sunglasses , etc  .
) scratch that easily and that badly  .
it's scary  .
watching sport channels is almost better than being there  .
the detail is beautiful and clear  .
the only complaint you are going to have here is from the wives of the fellows who come over  .
they won't want to go home i compared this television to the almighty kuro , and my eye loves this television more , whether it is in bright or dark lighting  .
good hdmi cables and a good signal make this tv outstanding  .
there is no perfect tv out there , and we can always find fault in anything   but finding fault in this tv is like trying to spot fly droppings in pepper admittedly , i was not impressed at first , because i is tuned in to a standard low resolution channel  .
the characters were pixelating and there is some motion blur  .
then i plugged in my thumb drive with some high resolution pictures and i is totally blown away  .
then i grabbed my hd video recorder which has avchd format , and i is knocked out again  .
i started up my blu    ray and the picture is practically 3    d  .
i went back to my receiver and tuned in some hd channels and soon you couldn't get the smile off my face  .
it is beautiful later that evening , i grabbed the remote control , and it lights up instantly , displaying all the buttons i started playing with some of the features , which i had thought to be gimmicky at first  .
i tried the gallery and it had choices of pictures to view like , wildlife , landscape and popular paintings  .
this made the tv transform into a large picture frame with brightly lit up works of art  .
it couples those works of art with music or you can play your own tunes  .
beautiful if you have company over the gallery has loads of other features that are interesting as well the internet options were not quite what i thought they would be , and again , at first they didn't give me any more info than the nintendo wii , but i can easily see that with this feature ; the game has just begun there is some blooming , but again , it certainly depended on what you are watching  .
for the most part , i didn't see it  .
i also heard that off center viewing is not as good as head on  .
well i am afraid i just don't see that either  .
if you have to look that hard to find a problem with this set , just buy the kuro  .
it is a beautiful set but doesn't have half the features and is just as expensive the samsung 8000 is expensive but that is the price you pay for the leading edge in technology  .
i did not give this tv a five star rating simply because this is new technology and we are in a state of evolution .
overall a really cool step in the direction of a sleek style with the thickness of the tv , but a step backwards in picture quality  .
still an lcd tv it just uses led for a backlight which seams to be very misleading as they say nothing about lcd even in the manual uneven backlight , really noticable on anamorphic widescreen movies  .
poor viewing angles compared to previous samsung lcd tvs  .
contrast is poor especially when taken out of vivid mode or after the tv has been calibrated  .
out of the box everything is cranked up on high to make contrast look ok which looks nice in the store but not in a low light area like your home in my opinion the only reason to buy this tv is if you need something really thin for a certain application  .
you can spend less and get a better picture in the standard samsung or sony line .
after owning the tv for the last six month i got a big white bar right in the middle of the tv  .
samsung will not replace the tv ; the only thing is that they will fix it  .
the repair center will make you jump through so many hoops in order to get to what you want first , they call me ask again for the , serial number , model number , version number , and the receipt  .
well i went home gave them the information but then they said if your tv on the wall you need to take down , they will not touch it is on the wall  .
how am i gonna get the tv off the wall  .
so much work just to fix it  .
be aware of bad customer service from samsung i paid a lot of money for a crap tv and service ; i am stupid for trusting samsung  .
will never happen again .
i have kitchen and family room connect  .
while cooking and visiting off to the side you see bleached colors on screen  .
so much for led  .
i returned this tv for the plasma panasonic tc    p54vt25    same price range and features .
good looking tv  .
but i think this tv is make for lots of light and open space only  .
if u think of put this tv in a darker room  .
like basement or not lots of light then this tv is not for you  .
else u will regret it for $3000 .
had this set for less than 3 weeks when it started intermittently turning off then back on again , first 2 service companies that samsung gave the call to , completely blew me off after i sat home from work , losing money , waiting for them , onlyh to have them blame it on samsung  .
finally a decent repair company came out , a small television store , with 1 repair guy , he is awesome  .
set worked for a few more weeks , then started intermittently switching inputs and volume settings , again , samsung is horrible  .
lots of explaining away problems , told me set is very fragile and i should expect problems  .
this is the second level , what they call ecr executive customer rep  .
oh boy , i feel special , i is informed they would absolutely not consider replacing set until i had at least 3 major repairs , how many of you can afford to take off 3 days from work , after spending $3000 on their tv in the first place  .
samsung again is the worst at customer service  .
i should have learned my lesson after the bdp1200 blu ray fiasco i went through  .
what a shame , such a nice picture  .
i really enjoyed the set for the frirst couple of weeks while it worked .
poor usability    i have all of my hdmi inputs routed through my av receiver  .
the problem with this display is that it automatically configures the optimum display settings for a given hdmi input based upon the selected name of the input  .
since i have a blu    ray player and 2 pcs connected to my av receiver , the optimum settings for the blu    ray player are not the same settings required for optimum viewing of the pcs  .
for best viewing quality for the pc , i must change the selected hdmi input name to dvi/pc and when i decide to watch a blu    ray movie , i must change the name of the input to blu    ray  .
i find this feature to be absolutely ridiculous loss of detail in blacks    i've noticed that although this unit has very deep blacks , but there appears to be a loss of detail  .
its as though the unit has been calibrated to emphasize deep black levels in favor of all other colors motion blur    even with the 240hz enabled , this unit still suffers from motion blur  .
one example of where this can be seen easily is while watching pirates of the caribbean on blu    ray , when jack and barbosa are in the cave with the gold , motion blur is very noticeable when barbosa moves around quickly with his big black hat grainy picture    although this tv has an incredible contrast ratio , i've noticed that this unit suffers , like many samsung lcds , from a very grainy picture while watching blu    ray movies  .
the picture looks a lot like a high    iso photograph in summary , this tv has a beautiful form    factor , only 1 inch thick  .
i love the rotating base and initially , the incredible contrast ratio does appear stunning  .
unfortunately , i find the motion blur , image noise and loss of detail in blacks a deal breaker  .
i have returned this unit to replace it with a kuro elite plasma display  .
while the kuro does not drop my jaw , i can now watch a movie without being distracted by motion blur or image noise .
let me begin this review by stating that amazon  .
com has been very good about helping me with my problem  .
their return policy and customer service are among the best in the industry now   samsung is a different story i bought this television based on the specs , the online reviews and samsung's own website  .
the screen size and the price point seemed great for us  .
when it arrived , it is even more beautiful in person  .
sadly , the picture quality is awful  .
i know that electronic devices can be perfect out of the box or doa out of the box , so i is a bit disappointed when i installed the tv and found out that it was not working properly  .
the backlight is horribly uneven (more than just the typical edge lit led screens are uneven stuff this is very noticeable on all inputs)  .
any all    black screen is marred by clouds of white light  .
worse , there were digital artifacts around all edges and contrasty spots  .
it looked like a b w checkerboard surrounded everything , and it is also visible on all hdmi inputs (dish dvr and xbox) and on our samsung bluray player  .
the sound occasionally dropped out , and there were weird all    magenta screen flashes randomly happening  .
you get the point  .
this is a defective tv unaware of amazon's customer    friendly return policy , i called samsung to take advantage of their in    home warranty service  .
i'm not going to spend pages and pages ranting about how awful the experience was  .
i'll just say it is awful  .
they came out three times (very late , two out of three of them) and could not fix the problems  .
i thought it would be a no    brainer to have samsung step up and replace the tv with a working model  .
nope  .
they've given me the run    around for almost two months  .
they finally said that the service tech had not specifically written deemed unrepairable , so they could not replace it unless he did  .
hours of back    and    forth calls later , they finally deemed it unrepairable , and said they'd replace the tv except that they apparently do not have any of that model available in any of their warehouses  .
they told me i should just wait for them to contact me  .
they do not know when that will happen i checked amazon's site , and they said they'd take back the tv right now and replace it with a brand new one  .
i've owned other samsung products in the past , so i'm not overly worried about getting another lemon  .
i'm just very , very disappointed in samsung's terrible customer service  .
it's rare to find a company who is adamant about not caring a bit about customer (dis)satisfaction  .
google samsung customer service sucks for many more stories just like mine and again , i have to say that amazon is a stellar company  .
thanks to them for rescuing me from further dealings with samsung's corporate flunkies  .
i is initially responding to previous user of the same line of led tvs , but figured i should write a review as i had a similar experience  .
the 46 version of the same set never worked correctly from day 1  .
filled out online service request from samsung as i really thought it would be quick and easy because i loved the looks and the thinness of the set , that is where i realized i better do whatever it takes to get rid of this tv  .
customer service is a nightmare , every company they gave the call to backed out at the last minute , and i is left sitting home waiting , and never a call from samsung to explain why  .
happily , i is able to convince the store to exchange the set with a sony , although not as slim , much more reliable company , as i have had past experience with them  .
i is lucky , but i really had fantasies of framing the samsung tv , oh well , i guess the other user hit it when they said samsung told them this is a very fragile set  .
too bad .
just google samsung lcd won't turn on and you will see thousands of users have issues with samsung lcd tvs just after a year  .
samsung wo not stand by their product or make a tv that lasts more than a year ripoffreport  .
com has a lot of reviews charting the terrible customer service and poor product quality of samsung .
not sure the technology is ready yet  .
