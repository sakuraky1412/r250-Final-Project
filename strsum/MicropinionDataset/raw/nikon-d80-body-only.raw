Pros:. Better control when Cropping, light weight and perfect for anything to do with family photos and travel/ vacation. 
Cons:. I've never had an issue with this camera. 
Summary:. With its 10mp I can make large prints and yes this is perfect for me when Im shooting a sunset. and want the photo in my Living room-. I dont get tired carrying this in Parades, Birthday Parties, Family Reunions and Wine Festivals -. I get more control over color and depth of field, my photos come out more artistic rather than. plain snap shots.. My precious Daughter has gold speckles in her eyes I never noticed before -. the software that came with my D80 to edit photos let me really get close in my photos and. honestly I like the way it shoots so I rarely do touch ups unless something needs a tiny warmth filter.. I recommend this to anyone starting out, its kit lenses might not be the best - but- can easily be replaced. with better ones-. I fully suggest FX lenses- they fit my D80, D300 and I even hear they fit the D3X (my next camera on my wish list). I do love the versatility of adding grips and taking extra SB600's with me to family re-unions -. the Pocket Wizards can really make this a good cam if you know what you're doing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Sturdy, Pic quality excellent. features not found on some of the more expensive Nikons. Reasonable price. . The mgps count is larger, as is the LCD screen. It works with older NikonNFDSLR film cameras. . advanced amatuer or the Proffesional.. 
Cons:. The Nikon Software &#38; no free remote. For the price I think a Remote should be includedand the Nikon software could be better. The Shutter lag is slightly slower than the earlier D70/ 70S DSLR. 
Summary:. I am bias to Nikon because I got my first Nikon when they were made less bulky than the 1rst Canon Film Cameras ( which didn't feel right in my hands.) Way to bulky and I have large hands.. The Nikon D80DSLR is feels very comfortable in my hands, The controls are similar to the Nikon film cameras, so learning curve was very easy.Lots of features..Some not available on more expensive DigitalSLR's at a reasonable price. Plenty of menus submenus, focus modes..lots of options to personalize to your own type of shooting.. If you are an advanced amateur or a Proffessional this is the camera for all types of shoooting ..plus blow-ups with no noise or pixelation problems at 11" X 14" enlargements.. As to my comment about the 1rst Canons. They have made great progress in reducing the bulkiness of their DigitalDSLR's and All Dgital as has Nikon.Unless you want to spend a small fortune on a Camera that becomes obsolete within months. Buy this Nikon. Don't go spending $2000.00-$3000.00 on a 21 megapixel camera. They too will become obsolete a short time after their release if you aren't Shooting Fashion Models or Travel the Globe to Photograph Wildlife in exotic places. Just my opinion.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright and clear pictures.. 
Cons:. Pixels could have been more. 
Summary:. I love my Nikon D80. It's easy to handle almost like a "aim and shoot" camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. all the controll u need, great amount of accesories, custom menus etc. 
Cons:. price whent down a lot in one year..maybe should have waited a year. 
Summary:. This by far and away the best camera i have ever shot on. All the control i need for any situation, fast, nice menu layout, most importantly great pictures and a ton of accessories available.. I have used the canon equivalent both at work and at home quite extensively before making this purchase and i must say the Nikon out performs it in every way every time.. best camera i have ever had. 

$$;
Pros:. The thing was designed to fit my hands &#38; fingers, Function button &#38; focus lock I'm always using. Single shot is sooo quick and the lens rocks the house.. 
Cons:. Nothing in this range, if I wanted more features I'd buy the D300,. etc. 
Summary:. For the prosumer you cannot go wrong.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing picture quality. 
Cons:. I can't remember how to do all the functions. 
Summary:. It's been years since I had my film SLR. I finally broke down and purchase the D80. I love this camera. I've gotten pictures that my friends say look like a pro took them. They only think I'm having problems with is remembering how to implement all the options that are available or let's say "user error". You can't go wrong with this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Above film quality. 
Cons:. I haven't found any.. 
Summary:. I have been an avid shutterbug since the age of 9 when I bought an old box camera at a local sale that makes 43 years of photo taking. I even collect collect camera's. I started buying Nikons about 5 yrs. ago the N80 I have a large amount of accessories for this camera so the D80 was a logical joice, all lenses fit the D80. So if you don't have previous lenses you may concider the d40x which is the same megapixels. The photo quality is amazingly sharp even when you zoom in on a jpg on the computer. I also use photoshop 7 so I do recommend a good photo computer program to enhance photos you like. Don't take this like you need a photo work program to get good photo's just better pictures colors and I also change pictures around like you see in the magazines. I have shot professionally (film camera's) weddings, books, brochures and so on. Trust what I say the film camera has it's place in photography the only problem is, it is in my camera case now and most likely will stay there. If you are concidering buying the D80 please allow me to help you make up your mine. Contact me at N8YGN@aol.com with any questions you may have. Good luck and keep taking pictures.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, size, balance.. 
Cons:. Not as "convenient" as a small point and shoot camera.. 
Summary:. I have owned this camera (with the 18-135mm lens) since March '07 and have several thousand great photos to show for my investment. As a "Gadget Guy", this camera does everything I ask of it (which isn't much at this time) and more. I am just beginning to scratch the surface of the camera's true potential. The more time I spend with it, the better I am understanding how all of the settings work with or against each other. I have 2 batteries and 2 high speed 2 gig SD cards, and very rarely run out of battery or memory! (that's +/-900 shots total!). My wife thinks the camera is too hard to use, so she plinks around on our old point-&#38;-shoot digital camera. But, when she wants "keeper" photos, she calls on me to be her "Personal Photographer". I have become the Designated Photographer for our Families, Brownie Group, Church, Work, Buddies, Sports teams, School functions, etc.. The only thing I can think of that would make the camera easier to use is a hand-strap from the base to the right strap mount that would make carrying the camera for extended periods (Disneyland, Parades, Races, etc.) easier.. My next investment for the D80 camera is a faster mid-range zoom lens to capture indoor sporting events, concerts, museum type shots easier and with higher quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's a NIKON. It has tons of lenses available. It's reasonably priced. It uses SDHC cards. It has a built in flash.. 
Cons:. Don't know of any yet.. 
Summary:. I have had this camera for six months. I have rented higher end D200s and D2Xs for special events. I am very impressed by the ease of use of my Nikon D80. I create some very impressive images with this precious piece of technology and LOVE doing it.. 

$$;
Pros:. perfect images, clear and color. 
Cons:. none at all. 
Summary:. For about 4 to 6 months I have been reading anything I could get my hands on about DSLR's. I was set to purchase the Canon XTI when an acquaintance I know said to her it didnt give the image quality she thought it should. That sent me back to reading posts, buying every camera magazine I could find. To get to the point, I purchased the D80. I loaded the images on the computer I printed them, and its by far more impressive then I had hoped it would be. The pictures are just so clear I cant get over it. I've had some good 35mm SLRs and only point and shoot digital cameras, one expensive point and shoot. I truly thought it wasnt possible to get a clear, good color, picture from a digital camera, right from the camera and not having to retouch it with ms image pro 9. Printed they look as good as any 35mm I have shot. If youre doing what I was doing, looking reading and wondering, take it from me you will be just as surprised as I was when that first image comes up on the monitor. I know a perfect score shouldnt be given for most things but I gave it one because the D80 is what I thought couldnt be had in digital pictures.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pro camera at a fair price. 
Cons:. Wish it had VR in the camera. 
Summary:. This camera is packed with goodies, I am very happy with the Nikon D80. I got the 18-135mm lens and it is great. I looked at the Canon rebel XTI but it felt really cheap in my hand while the D80 really feels solid.... and it is!!! I have dropped mine. from a desk and it did not scratch a thing. This is simply the best out ... period!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. A little more expensive than canon (well lenses are). 
Summary:. This camera is just brilliant. The menu system is intuitive and easy. Photos are just superb. Supports large capacity SD cards (ie SD-HC). Auto mode does everything, but if you want to start playing, there is a 149 page manual (yes just one language!) which allows you to adjust so many parameters and settings so appeals to enthusiasts aswell as novices. I use with the nikkon 18-200mm lense and I am just blown away with quality, colour, resolution, clarity etc.... Takdees Sheikh. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Pics, Intuituve, Easy To Use, A Lot of Features!. 
Cons:. Expensive Lenses. 
Summary:. A jump from film to my first DSLR. I tested a number of other brands but fell in love with Nikon. The D80 camera is light, well built and easy to use. A great number of features give you the ability to really creat inovative shots. I carry it with me all the time. The long battery life is a blessing. I love the 18-200DX VR lense. Such versatility with this particular lense. Photography is my hobby and I enjoy it immensely...Hope you dicover the same!. 

$$;
Pros:. very easy to use, perfect image quality, full of features. 
Cons:. flash casts shadow on some lenses, no self cleaning sensor. 
Summary:. I bought this camera with the 18-200 VR lens.. The first couple of pics I took with the camera were of the moon which I thought would be really hard because not only is this my first DSLR but it is also my first digital camera. The pics turned out really great. I couldn't believe how much details I got. I didn't even use a tripod, the lens is awesome and the VR works great. I can't tell you how easy it was to change the settings and get the picture exactly the way I wanted. The camera performs perfectly in low light. It is so much fun to use. The command dials are perfect. You can change almost everything you need (ISO, Image Quality, Size, Shutter speed, Aperture) which is great because you don't have to go into menus every time you need to take a picture.. I was comparing this camera to the Canon XTi (aka 400D) and the Sony Alpha (as, I'm guessing, everyone is) and I'm glad I chose this one. The Sony Alpha felt so cheap when I tried it, and the Canon XTi as well. This is of course not the reason why I chose the D80, but I've done A LOT of research during the last 3 months and everyone seemed to agree about the fact that the D80 is the best among the 3. Probably the Sony offers the best price at the range of features it is offering but my suggestion is add the extra money and you will not regret it. At least you know you are buying a camera from a well established name in the world of (D)SLRs AND, most importantly, lenses. For the Canon, a lot of people seem to agree that it has exposure problems for back-lit objects. You wouldn't want to pay this amount of money in a camera and have a problem like that.. The lens is great. It is an "All in one" lens. It is all I need from wide angle to a decent zoom range. There is a problem however with the flash, it casts shadow if you are shooting at 18mm (the widest angle of the lens).. 

$$;
Pros:. image quality, shooting speed, controls........... 
Cons:. Nothing........... 
Summary:. If just want take a point a shot picture the camara do it for you or if i want take a more complex profesional picture the camara just do it too, work excelent to every one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive point and shoot, but with lots of controls. 
Cons:. Need a second battery, supplying a training video would be a great asset.. 
Summary:. It was great to open the box, intuitive to assemble, and point and shoot some sharp shots, even in the worst light conditions.. There are a host of controls that will allow greater control for experts.. 

$$;
Pros:. Robust body, great quality, awesome battery life.. 
Cons:. Haven't found any!. 
Summary:. My story is that I bought a D80 with the 18 - 55mm kit lens... I heard great things about the Canon Xti... So I decided to give it a try as well... I was disappointed, I shot some photos of my girlfriend with both cameras, compared the quality, D80 beat the XTI by far on MY opinion... I returned the XTI and the 18 - 55mm lens, I got 2 different Nikkor lenses: 28 - 80mm and 70 - 300mm. The camera is beautiful, the body is just awesome, I thought I was going to like the xti being a little smaller, but it felt like a cheap toy, I didn't feel right with it, the D80's got to be the best purchase I've in a while.. 

$$;
Pros:. All of the features you want, feels very good in your hands, well made and solid. 
Cons:. Have not found one yet. 
Summary:. I am more than a beginner, but not close to being professional. If you cannot take good pictures with this camera, give it up. I researched and researched and looked at Canons, Olympus, and Sony. The Canon Rebel XTI was a close second, but when you hold and shoot these two cameras --- side by side, the quality and solid feel of the Nikon is obvious. It is like the difference between a chevy and a Lexus. The LCD is big and bright. If you are looking for a digital SLR, and you look at the D80, you will buy it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super color rendition, relative ease of operation, light weight with great ergonometrics, handles almost all nikkors at a great price point.. 
Cons:. slow frames per second, not a begginers or a pros cam but intermediate enthusiast will love learning on this beauty.. 
Summary:. This is an exceptional intermediate skill level cam if you are learning and earning your way up the Nikon camera chain. it is not a pro level camera but it gets close.. D80 prices for this discontinued camera are very afordable betweem $600-700 for this $999 beauty. If you don't have the skills and or bucks for an FX D700 or D3 get a D80. You'll love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Damn good camera. Full with need to have and nice to have functions.. 
Cons:. Of course, its lack of new functions. :D. 
Summary:. Never feel sorry to brought this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. functionality, design, great interface, image quality. 
Cons:. iso 800 +, built-in flash. 
Summary:. today it's one of the best cameras i've ever owned.i've made about 60.000 photos and i could say it works really like a clock even when the temperature is extremely low.. splendid choice. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use you can use your other lens with this Camera, easy to change out your lens light weight very good pictures great quality photos.. 
Cons:. The only thing I didn`t like is that the speed could be a bit faster. 
Summary:. as I said before I like that fact that you can use your lens from your other camera the photo Quality is great easy to use light in weight i like the fact it has a 10.2mp the speed could be better maybe 4 frames per second other than that is a great Camera I would recomend this to anyone who loves Cameras I rate this Camera @ ****and 1|2 stars. 

$$;
Pros:. Comparatively lightweight for the rich feature set. Beautiful images. Plenty to keep the experienced armature and more advanced engaged. Good feel. Easy to control without peeking once you get to know the camera. Takes great photographs.. 
Cons:. I've experienced some grain issues at ISO 400 and above while using a circular polarizer but I'm probably underexposing by a stop or more.. 
Summary:. I bought mine with the 18-135 mm kit lens and added the 70-200 f/2.8 soon after. What a dream. Not too heavy on the neck or wallet. Very functional. Easy to use and setup. Fun, fun, fun. I almost always shoot in manual but the few times I've used Auto haven't let me down one bit. Focuses quickly. The view finder is easy to read even with 50+ year old eyes. Had mine for 18 months and love it. Price is even better now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great pictures and love the zoom lense. 
Cons:. A little complex with all of the features and buttons to learn. 

$$;
Pros:. All around functions, picture quality. 
Cons:. Need some time to get used to for new users. 
Summary:. Absolutely fabolous camera once used with decent lens. 

$$;
Pros:. Great camera feel and awesome photos in any situation, day or night. 
Cons:. If any, it has to be a lot of menus. 

$$;
Pros:. Build , Performance , Quality , Software. 
Cons:. Not titanium body any way. 
Summary:. This camera has the right amount of pixels for the sensor size , the right design for a photographer and the right price for this changing industry. Felipe Henao. www.felipehenao.com. 

$$;
Pros:. Great pictures in any shooting mode. 
Cons:. Manual is too technical. 
Summary:. I'm an amateur photographer and love this camera for its picture quality and flexibility in use. I can shoot in any of the auto modes and get great pictures. White balance is very accurate in auto, though sometimes auto mode overexposes the image.. Now that I've had the camera for a year, I rarely use auto mode. I like how easy it is to change settings without toggling through the menus. There are many short-cut keys on board to quickly tweak white balance, ISO, aperture, shutter speed, metering, exposure, focus area, etc. It's just easy to use. Shooting in RAW mode is a huge plus for computer editing. There are minor editing capabilities on the camera, but I prefer to do all editing in Photoshop Elements 6.. I also like the wide range of accessories available, especially since I didn't know what I wanted when I first bought it. I did skip the standard lens and splurged for the AF-S Nikkor 17-55mm 1:f2.8G lens without regret. The images I can get from just this lens are phenomenal. I'm an art quilter and when I travel to shows. I take pictures of quilts from 6+ feet away in bad light (flash use is typically prohibited). I have to capture white thread on white fabric. Not only do I see the thread in the images, but I see the individual fibers of the fabric when I zoom in. I also have a Nikkor 100-300mm zoom, a Sigma 10-20mm wide-angle, and the SB800 flash with a Light Sphere from Gary Fong.. I considered the Nikon D40 because I'm an amateur and I new the D200 was way too much for me. I'm glad I chose the D80 because I probably would have replaced the D40 with a D80 within the first year. I can't imagine replacing this camera any time soon. It will suit my needs for 10 years or more.. If this is your first digital SLR, I highly recommend an after market book or DVD to understand all the functions of the camera--the manual is way too technical.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp, precise pictures under tough conditions. 
Cons:. Not a single one. 
Summary:. After a year of frustration with a near-SLR from Panasonic, I debated the merits of this upgrade. But, the speed and accuracy of this Nikon makes it well worth it...Particularly when trying to catch the fast motion and fleeting expressions of small children. This camera satisfies the photographer but is simple enough for a point-and-shoot user to love. Nikon is just plain brilliant.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fixes many probems of old D70. 
Cons:. Non yet! Only using it about 4 months. 
Summary:. Awesome, I bought it with the 18-135 as a kit. Lens good for the cost, but not great. Upgraded recently to 18-200 VR.... WOW. I am a semi-pro who does mostly industrial/commercial photography. 90% of my 1st shots of a subject are great, and I seldom have to revisit a shoot.. 

$$;
Pros:. great photos and easily customized. 
Cons:. I have found one yet. 
Summary:. I just received my camera on Friday just in time for my trip to Verona, Italy. Took over 200 pictures with just a half of a battery, all amazing photos. Most photos were taken on auto, can't wait to get my own personal touches to the photos. Don't believe all the bad reviews. Great camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Over 100 user controled features. Rugged feel. Fast continuous pics. 
Cons:. Built-in flash is fair. 
Summary:. The best, I bought the SP-600 flash, 10-24mm and 70-135mm. Nothing works better! Add a Canon Pixma 9500 and you'll rival the best money can buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. great camera.. 
Cons:. extend your camrea battery life, invest in the multi battery pack.. 
Summary:. My first digital slr was the d70, which I loved. I upgraded to the d80, which has been a wonderful choice. I have not been dissappointed at all. Now that the prices is a little lower; it is a good investment, for those who didn't have questions about spending d300 money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Having been out of the photo buisness for over 20 years. I was impressed by the advancements in 35mm photography. What I used to do with 5 cameras I now do on one.. 
Cons:. A Pricey beginer's camera but one to jump into with both feet if you are into photography.. 
Summary:. Fantastic reuslts in every shooting circumstance. The high ISO parameters allow great available light photography, Virtually taking a photo in the dark.I am still learning to set it up but so far, with the use of a photo tweaking program, the results are great! I recomend you purchase the Md-80b power grip. I've left it on over night and the batteries have yet to run down and I've taken over 1000 pictures. Equiped with the 18 to 135 MM lens and the 70-300mm lens there isn't much you can miss. The camera is quick and responsive. Although it makes for a "Big Brick" hanging around you neck it is a great piece of quality equipment.. 

$$;
Pros:. flawless shots in all auto modes. easy to use manual modes. 
Cons:. LED screen can be a bit difficult to read. 
Summary:. LOVE this camera. I used a friends Rebel Xti for a week to try it out and was ready to buy Canon. Read the reviews about the D80 and decided to try another friends D40. Loved the D40 and decided to go with the upgraded D80. D80 is absolutely the best DSLR under $1000...period. Everything from image quality to quality of the actual camera is head and shoulders above the Canon sub $1500 category. Can't believe Nikon has the D80 priced where it is when it is very comparable to the D200.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent features , Crystal Clear Pictures. 
Cons:. None encountered. 
Summary:. Many quality cameras are currenly available in this category of SLR's. I am very pleased with my decision to purchase this particular camera ,Nikon D 80, with the kit lens 18-135 mm. If you take the time to read the manual, learn all of its features,(Practice, Practice , Practice), you will be amazed by the versatility of this particular model. An absolute pleasure to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great photo quality. 
Cons:. Price could be more reasonable. 
Summary:. Brilliant. I work for a Online Printing Store and this camera gives great results both from my camera and my friends. I would reccommend this camera to others. Expressphoto Australia. http://www.expressphoto.com.au. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, Take great auto pictures plenty of manual features. Battery life is great.. 
Cons:. Menu could be easier to use. Small view finder. 
Summary:. This is my first digital SLR (Nikon F4s)and I really love it. It is fast and easy to use in Auto mode for my wife who is a point and shoot person. And works great in manual modes. It shoots a little over exposed in P mode so have to set to -.7 in full sun light, but if it's cloudy set it back to .00. Read Ken Rockwell's directions, big help with getting started. I have the 18-135mm lens that came as a kit and am very happy with this lens. The 18-200 is a better lens but 3 times the price and after taking over 2,000 pictures on my Alaska adventure and Washington's Olympic Nat. Park I'm very pleased with the results in all kinds of conditions. I purchased the 70-300 nice lens but not sure I would do it again. I got used to the menu on my trip but towards the end things got really busy and I switched over to auto and I'm still very happy with the results. I wish they had not gone to the SD chip as I had to buy all new ones and the filter size is different also, but if you don't have other camera stuff this won't matter. The SDhc chip I purchased with fast and didn't have any noticable lag even when shooting is RAW. I was surprised how long the batteries lasted. I took 3 and only used 2. Battery life lasted more than 1 full day of shooting even using the camera flash for fill light. Oh one big gripe the lens hood has to come off when using the flash otherwise you get a shadow in your picture. Would I buy again? OH YEA!. 

$$;
Pros:. Big and bright veiwfinder, Buttons are in the place you want them to be, Excellent image quality, Pop-up flash, SD and SDHC compatible, Nice hand grip, and status LCD. 
Cons:. Nikon D80 has 1/4000 of a second shutter speed compared to the Nikon D70s (1/8000 of a second).. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast startup time, great resolution when shooting in RAW, very customizable. 
Cons:. My 18-135 lens did stop working after a few months, but after sending it to the nikon people, they got it fixed and sent it back, all for free.. 
Summary:. The Nikon D80 is a great camera to have. It is very fast, can easily be customized, and with 10.2 effective megapixels, its the way to go.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful images, lots of custom features, start up time of about 0.18 seconds, very long battery life, low noise at high ISO's.. 
Cons:. top shutter speed of 1/4000. 
Summary:. Basically a D200 w/out 5 frames per second, 1/8000 shutter speed, and weather proof body. Outstanding performance. Great for someone who wants to move up from a point and shoot, but wants more than what an entry level DSLR can offer. Large and bright LCD. Viewfinder is the same one as the D200. Like the viewfinder, the Nikon D80 has the same sensor as the D200. Why should you choose this camera over a Canon? For one thing it a fast start up time of about 0.18 seconds. For another reason the noise at high ISO settings of this camera is less than the Canon 400D. It also shoots faster that the 400d (I've been comparing this camera to the 400d, but it really was designed to match up to the Canon EOS 30D). This camera also has a status LCD on top of the camera which I prefer over a combined LCD. The accessories available for this camera are great. You have most Nikon lenses and flashes. By the way, Nikon is at the top of the line in flashes. This camera is also built a lot more solidly than the canon EOS 400D. It's not weather proof, but it has a metal chassis and an outer shell of plastic. There are several rubber seals and grips. These seals protect the camera better than just plain plastic. This is an outstanding camera that will take anyone far. You could be a hobbyist or a newspaper photographer, this camera can do it all. I highly recommend it!

$$;
Pros:. Gorgeous pictures. real easy to use if you are new to dSLR cameras or SLR. Can give you full control over your pictures.. 
Cons:. Have not found one yet. might take some time to learn all the things it can do.. 
Summary:. I've owned many different Nikon SLR and Cannon SLR cameras. This is my first digital-SLR and I love it. I can set the top dial to manual and do everything myself or use one of the other settings and get just a great of pictures. (actually better, I've still got some room to improve my skills). I'm the local Amateur photographer. My pictures and services have become more requested since I bought the D80. I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. it has a really fast shutter speed and it is all around great. 
Cons:. the flash sync can only go up to 1/200 of a second which can be annoying. 
Summary:. it is a great step-up from a slow point and shoot. i have really enjoyed owning this camera. 

$$;
Pros:. Features, color rendition, resolution, image quality. 
Cons:. Flash doesn't seem to lift high enough, but I use a Speelight and don't care. 
Summary:. I love this camera. I upgraded from the D50 and I'm so happy I did. I use this camera with the 85mm f/1.4 and the 18-200 VR lenses and couldn't be happier. I love the ease of use, user interface, responsiveness, speed and color rendition. I'll keep this camera and be happy with it for a long time to come.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, great pictures, intuitive interface. 
Cons:. Limited software. 
Summary:. Right out of the box, charge the battery and take some nice shots with the 18-135 zoom. I'm an old school film shooter from the days of the great Nikon F and digital is a brave new world for me. But with this camera, I feel very well equipped for exploring it. Some of my stuff is published and it's already looking better. 

$$;
Pros:. Improved sensor from the D50, several focusing options, image quality is superb, great construction quality, crazy battery life.. 
Cons:. Flash needs more power. 
Summary:. Overall I rated this camera as a 9. Previously owning a D50 and using a D200 for a month (my Dad's) the D80 is closer to the D200 as far as functionality and overall picture quality, even though it's almost $400 less than the D200.. I've found the "Auto" setting to be a LOT more consistent in shooting compared to the lower models - the exposure and F-stop settings in Auto tend to be very close in a single setting.. Manual modes are very easy to customize without having to delve into the menu. Provided buttons around the display and thumb wheels make settings a breeze to adjust.. Image quality with a decent lens is exceptional. Focus speed is very fast and allows multiple shots to be taken without much buffer time between shots. A faster memory card is highly recommended when shooting in NEF (RAW) format, as the file sizes can exceed 12MB per shot depending on the situation.. The battery life is consistent with all of the Nikon DLSR models - it lasts forever.. Using the iTTL with Nikon's SB flash series produces clear and correctly exposed pictures.. I highly recommend this camera versus the D80 or the D200, unless the D200 offers capabilities you MUST have as a professional..

Pros:. 2.5 lcd, 18-70 mm lens, and so much more.... 
Cons:. nothing yet, having to search for focus ring.... 
Summary:. I love this camera! I recently took a very huge leap and purchased the nikon d80 about 2 weeks ago. I went from my canon s3is to this and wow! I am glad I did. I've been researching my next slr camera for about 6 months and was pretty convinced that I would go to another Canon, as I've always liked canon, that is until I got my hands on this beauty. I was hooked from the minute I picked it up and started to play. I'm new to the world of slr's and this is a very user friendly camera. Everything from the 2.5 lcd to the in-camera editing,the 18-70mm lens that came with it (it has the metal mount). I also purchased the 70-300mm zoom. I took it to the beach and took over 200 pics. With the polarizer the colours were rich and vibrant(right out of the camera)@ so much better than any other digital camera I've owned. The images are crisp and razor sharp. The camera is incredibly fast with virtually no start-up time, it's ready to shoot when you. are . I'm still learning how to use it so I haven't come across anything negative about it yet(although I seriously doubt that I will). The only thing I have had an issue with is trying to fing the manual focus ring, I suspect this will be easier to find once I become more familiar with using it and is in no way the fault of the camera.. All in all, I have no regrets about buying this camera and will never own another point and shoot. It feels good in your hand, it feels solid, it's very simple to use for the beginner and advanced enough for the semi-pro. It was a fantastic purchase!. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, quality of photos, design, weight.. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. I just upgraded from the D50, the model that is no longer available, and have been very impressed with this camera. I have always had Nikon cameras, even back in the film camera days, and this particular model is not at all a disappointment. It's fun to use, the larger media view area is fantastic, the colors are striking, and all in all, well worth the cost.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, ease in usage for a DSLR beginner (including reversable control wheels), incredible images, multiple remotes, fast multiple exposures, scores of accessories, extra display protection standard. 
Cons:. The top control buttons are way too small for my fingers. No macro without a special lens.. 
Summary:. This camera was the one I was directed to by a professional mentor, every pro seller, and numerous reviews both on and offline (including this site). I spent almost 6 months researching DSLR cameras and that culminated in two hours of side-by-side and 'in hand' comparisons, taking many shots in Ritz Cameras, the place I final made the purchase. The D80 easily outperformed everything under $2000. In the comparisons here, it was stacked against cameras well OVER $2000 and rated well.. My first con comment isn't really a reflection of the camera as much as it's a consideration for larger hands. The second tho, is a major loss for me, as I prefer macro photography to all other types.. I brought D80 home and was taking good shots in 15 minutes, without reading a single word of the manual. In 15 days, I was taking shots that were so good that one of them won an award in a citywide weekly contest. This camera is easier to use than my first two 'point and shoots' yet fully controllable now that I've moved to SLR equipment.. If you're a first time SLR buyer, this camera will hook you in seconds and it seems many, many people agree that it is one of the best options possible.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightning fast, excellant controls, crystal clearimages. 
Cons:. have to buy full RAW software. 
Summary:. I am a semi pro photographer, this is my 4th Nikon and this camera ROCKS!!!!ease of use, full of options, slave flash capable, and fast startup...if you are in the market for a rockin digital camera, the D80 is for you, you can't go wrong with this camera. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Great photos. Interchangeable lens.. 
Cons:. Lengthy owner manual.. 
Summary:. Canon who? This works well with all Nikon lens. Great feel. Superb programs. The pictures are truly professional quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. 10.2MP, 11 AF zones, big LCD, control panel has backlight, dual dial setup. 
Cons:. The D80 tends to overexpose highlights. It underexposes when built-in flash is used. 
Summary:. This is by far a fantastic camera. I was pretty much satisfied with using my D50 and D70s simultaneously for assignments, but I just couldn't resist on getting a 10.2MP camera. If you do a lot of cropping, those extra megapixels DO actually come in handy. However, as with any digital camera, there will be a few quirks. My D50 overexposed shots while my D70s underexposed. The D80 has its quirks too. It overexposes highlights which can easily be corrected by setting the EV to -0.3 or more. Also, when the built-in flash is used, even with the ISO bumped up, the D80 tends to underexpose (I use an SB-600 anyway, I just find the built-in flash to be rather weak). Other than that, the D80 makes the most of my lenses and then some. I was not disappointed at all. Don't get me wrong, the D200 with its 5fps and almost weatherproof body is a plus, but I tend to shell out more money on lenses than on bodies. The D80 is superb.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features,fast, and wonderful photos. 
Cons:. Got two that didn't work before this one. 
Summary:. I gave the D-80 a bad review, after taking two home that had major problems. Went looking for another brand and couldn't find one that had the features and felt as good. The sales person said give it one more try and it is the best thing I've ever done. All photos have turned out great. Low light isn't a problem either. I'm giving Nikon D-80 thumbs up.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great handling, excellent images, as many features as an amateur could want.. 
Cons:. None that I can think of.. 
Summary:. Great camera for the amateur who wants excellent images and a useful feature set in a camera that is a pleasure to use. Although great images are the most important aspect of advanced photography, the ease of use and versatility of the machine itself are not far behind. This camera fills the bill in all categories.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wonderful picture quality. 
Cons:. I haven't found it yet. 
Summary:. I am an advanced beginner and I am just delighted with the D80 SLR that I've had for about a month, my wife's early Christmas present to me (I had to have it!)I am hoping to soar to new photographic hights with this wonderful addition.. 

$$;
Pros:. Does all that we as amatures will probably ever need.. 
Cons:. How to learn all of the features that it has , and "remember" them.. 
Summary:. If you are looking for a Digital SLR, don't pass this one up for at least a look see, it is quite the Digital slr. We love it so far, but learning what it's capabilities are will require some of your time for sure. What we really like is that at turn on it is ready to shoot in a nano second, and you wont miss anything unless you blink. Prior to this we were using a NIKON Coolpix 8800, and at the time of this review it is in the shop for the "THIRD" time for the same problem, (Lens Error) that has yet to be fixed, we would "Strongly Suggest" going with a DSLR like this and save yourself the $1000.00 mistake that we made. Great DSLR. Ken.. 

$$;
Pros:. rugged design; intuitive interface; display easy to interpret; quick charging battery. 
Cons:. shooting mode not available in viewfinder; 3 f/s too slow for seriuos action; current ISO setting (other than "auto ISO") not displayed in view finder. 
Summary:. This is my first digital SLR after years of prosumer and pro film Canon SLRs. After a weekend of putting it through its paces, I am really impressed. Did I want to get the shot and no time to think about it? Shoot in full auto. Got time and want to play? Full manual gave me all the creative control I wanted. Program, Aperture and Shutter preferred modes all dead easy to use as were the preset image type modes. Macro shooting in mixed light industrial setting to outdoor winter seascapes didn't even have it breathing hard. Terrific colour saturation, sharpness and speed out of the 15mm-135mm zoom optics. My only big gripe is how it selects ISO settings. I had it set to fine, small images so that may have had something to do with it.. Bottom line, this is a Canon killer. It's not a 30D but it feels like a more serious robust camera than the Rebel XT and XTi and, at CDN$500 less than the 30D, it's a lot of camera for the dough. Nice job Nikon...over to you Canon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, well built, ability to produce excelent photos, Fast, great LCD display, Great view finder, a lot of manual control, baby D200, compact design , &#38; LCD cover. Did I miss something?. 
Cons:. No physical dust cleaning system!!! Why doesn't come with Capture NX?. 
Summary:. I had been planning to buy a DSLR for a long time. I planned to buy a XTI but after seeing D80 I know I really want the D80. So I bought D80 with 50mm f1.4. Gee, what an excelent combo!! I can take very very sharp and beautiful photos. I love the camera so much and it makes me want to take photos all the time. It is a such joy to use the camera. It feels really nice in my hand. I am glad that it uses SD card. It is a lot smaller to carry around. The battery last very long. It starts up so fast that I don't need to put it in stanby to take photos. The lens is really good for low light and it focus really realy fast. LOVE IT!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to work. 
Cons:. need more infor on certain procedures. 

$$;
Pros:. Big viewfinder and LCD. 
Cons:. None really. 
Summary:. This is one fabulous Digital SLR. I've always been a Canon fan but once I saw the lovely big viewfinder, the perfect-sized LCD, the great 18-135 lens, and its perfect size, I just had to switch brands. Canon's on-board flashes have never had the same metering as the add-on external flashes, whereas with the D80, the built-in flash gave absolutely perfect exposures.. I recommend this camera very highly!. Note: I bought a Sandisk 2 GB Ultra II card, and it does take about half to one second for the picture to show on the LCD. I think this is no fault of the camera; its just that for such a huge card, the card's memory size is too large I think. With a normal JPEG and large file size, which is the ideal setting, the camera can take 500 photos on the 2 GB card. I'm glad I got that size.. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid body full of semi pro features and a good 10 MP image.. 
Cons:. Extra cost for the software that should be supplied free in the box.. 
Summary:. It is Affordable when you consider the level and features of this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. 10.2MP CCD, gorgeous LCD, incorporates a lot of D200 features for $700 less. 
Cons:. Honestly haven't found any yet. 
Summary:. Since this camera just hit the streets less than 2 weeks ago, I obviously haven't had this for a super long time, but I moved to the D80 as an upgrade from the terrific D50, and the D80 takes care of every single minor nitpick I had with the D50, and then takes it even beyond that. Moreover, since I moved from the D50 and not a D70-series, I was thrilled that the D80 uses Secure Digital (SD) flash cards.. As with the D50, the D80 just feels terrific in my hand. I was concerned initially because the ergonomics of the grip have been ever so slightly modified (more like that of the D70s than the D50), and I really liked the feel of the D50. However, once I got the D80 and actually started using it and shooting with it, the concern evaporated quickly. The D80 is a complete success ergonomically.. This camera is blindingly fast. It's senseless to really even try to quantify it because the numbers (less than 0.1 second to start up) just don't convey how instantaneous shooting with this camera is. There's no discernible shutter lag, and shot-to-shot time is as fast as you need it to be. The D80 can fire up to 3 frames per second, up to 100 JPEGs deep. Amazing for a sub-$1,000 camera.. The things missing from the D50 that the D80 addresses? Backlit LCD, superimposable gridlines in the finder, depth of field preview, one-button bracketing, bright and large viewfinder, one-touch zooming on picture playback, and a snap-on clear plastic cover for the monitor.. As a bonus, some of the in-camera retouching options are fantastic. You can take a color shot, then convert it to B&#38;W with a red filter (still preserving your original image). You can utilize red-eye reduction (in the uncommon instances when it occurs at all), and Nikon's D-lighting is the digital equivalent of dodging and burning, and I love it.. The autofocusing on the camera is staggeringly fast when coupled with the right lens. Like other Nikon dSLRs, the D80 has an independent AF-assist light (some other cameras rely on the flash unit for this). For AF lenses utilizing the screw-driven focusing mechanism, there is a noticeable increase in focusing speed over the D50. You can also employ an 11-segment dynamic AF grid and select which segment will be used for the point of focus.. A word about the pop-up flash: It's brilliant. Rarely does a camera with a built-in flash get it right so often. I took numerous flash photos in sometimes varying and difficult lighting situations, and the D80 nailed it every single time.. The LCD is the best I've seen to date on any camera. Plenty of cameras have 2.5" monitors now, but this one has 230,000 pixels and is so sharp and detailed. You can view it from any angle in a 170-degree arc. Similarly, the viewfinder is a major improvement over both the D50 and the D70 series. Rather than utilizing a cheaper pentamirror like some of the competition, Nikon elects to use a genuine pentaprism which allows the finder to be nice and bright. Additionally, the diopter control knob with detents for each setting is a welcome change from the slider on the D50.. Image quality is suberb, as one would expect from a 10.2 MP dSLR. I like sharp, vivid pictures, and the D80 delivers. I haven't had any of my photos from the D80 printed out yet; only viewed them on a 19" monitor, but they look terrific.. The D80 is highly recommended as the perfect camera for the advanced amateur or enthusiast photographer. It bridges the gap between the D50 and the D200 perfectly. Pair this camera up with a high-quality lens, and a good photographer will have a tool with which stunning images can be made.. 

$$;
Pros:. 10mp Clarity of photos, EASE of USE, flexible, SDHC. 
Cons:. no built in VR, dust removal. 
Summary:. The D80 is an incredible camera with one of the easiest Digital menus in an SLR today. In addition, the built in editing function is unique and very useful. I just recently moved from an Nikon F100 to a D80 and this is not a step down. I have taken several photos with the camera and I can't believe the clarity-near film/better. Built in help menu is a HUGE plus, no more seeking out the manual. In addition, the D80 has many customizable menus that allow such things as on demand grid lines via FUNC (custom button). Sure Canon has the same MP, but you may miss the shot thumbing through cumbersome menus. Entrants like Sony/Pentax are good, but lenses? If you add an 18-200 VR Nikkor, you don't have to worry much about dust vibration. Nikon is definately putting out good product these days.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple enough for point and shoot. However, you can turn the dial and get 100% creative with no limits! The HDSD is NOT a Con...why? I've bent pins using CF cards, you won't with this.. 
Cons:. I wish it was more weatherized for rain. Nikon software is poor. Nikon should give us the free remote that's $10 or so.. 
Summary:. Well, 1st things 1st. How does she feel holding her. GREAT! The D80 has a real solid feel to her. It's not like the D200, which I think is heavy, so I prefer the lightness it offers. I hate boat anchors! The responsiveness is impressive from the second you turn it on and start playing. The camera is quick. Pictures? Great! They really look good, balanced and well saturated. Also, keep in mind that you can change these settings in the custom menu. The screen is a dream and the flash works well. I have an SB-800, and the camera can control it as a slave, no need to use an 800 as a master as the D80 does it! Ohh...flash sync. Well, if you use the right Nikon speedlight the camera/flash combo lets you sync at the full shutter range...so up to 1/4000th. Don't buy an aftermaket flash...the nikon works that much better. An SB600 is reasonable and a great flash unit. What else...I like the SD card slot. I had an issue where I bent the pins inside a camera with a CF card. No prob. here. Also, the SD slot supports the 'new' SDHD standard...basically, up to 32 gigs on a card. However, the largest I've seen is 8GB. I guess you can tell by now I really like the camera...I've used the Canon 10D and 20D. All great cameras, but I like this one more...it just moves. The camera can also edit pictures and remove 'red eye' and do other things automatically. Nice features.. What I don't like is the simple stuff...the Nikon software is poor and I have to spend $150 or so for 'better' software. I'm trying to shoot RAW but Nikon makes that difficult as the support is not yet avalable in Adobe or Bibble labs...however, that's soon to come. I wish the camera had some environmental seals...for rain. That's really it. It's a great camera that should last for years. It's a winner.. 

$$;
Pros:. awesome photos. 
Cons:. none found yet. 
Summary:. First step to a digital SLR from compact digital cameras and I must say I am very impressed. I researched for while and decided to wait for the d80 and I am not dissapointed.. I coupled the camera to the "Magic" Nikon 18-200mmVr lens and the images so far have been outstanding. This lens is worth every dollar and well worth the wait, as a matter of fact I recieved the lens before the camera.. The camera is extremley easy to use and very intuitive.. I have only had the camera a week or so but I can tell already that as I become more familar with it the pictures will only get better. 

$$;
Pros:. Resolution, rear panel, size, weight. 
Cons:. Slow shutter speed, only 1/4000, and slow flash sync. 
Summary:. My first digital camera was the D70s, I bought it a year ago and have a few thousand shots on it, but I was a little dissapointed by the 6.1 megapixel. But then comes the D80 with almost everything I loved about the D70s and at 10.2 megapixel how could I say no. I have had it for 2 days and am extatic to see that it simulates iso 100 whereas my D70s only did iso 200. It's extremely powerful and with that new func. button and all those D200 features I am in love with this thing. My D70s has just become a backup.. 

$$;
Pros:. size, speed, kit lens, feel, battery life. 
Cons:. SD card might be a negative for some, has some heft. 
Summary:. I have been waiting for several years to buy my first dSLR, and this is the camera that I was waiting for. Having had 2 35mm SLRs, I knew what I was looking for, but no dSLR to date had it all. The D80 does. Combining the size and quality with the kit lens and then the price is what led me to make my decision. That, and the fact that it takes about 4x the number of shots per charge than the Canon 400D, made it a dealbreaker.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nikon optics - Nikon quality to match. 
Cons:. Bigger than a point and shoot. 
Summary:. Taking photos as part of my profession (medical) for over twenty five years I can assure this is one of the best cameras I have ever owned. Nikon optics are without question among the worlds best and Nikon has a SLR digital camera to match at a reasonable price. The only draw back is the size when taking family photos, but on the other hand it is lightning fast--No more missed shots..

Pros:. La camara es gran versatilidad. 
Cons:. Al poco uso genera err y los talleres autorizados en Venezuela no estan al nivel profesional para repaparla, por ejemplo Casa Helmond.

$$;
Pros:. split view, bing on the turns, pretty loud voice. 
Cons:. buggy, slow. 
Summary:. This is my second Magellan. First one (4040) has been stolen so I bought this one from Costco.. For me it has some advantages over Garmin:. 1. Much louder voice. I used to have Garmin and on speed over 60 I couldn't hear it (my car is pretty noise one( Pilot ). 2. Split view. It very helpfull when you take exit on freeway. Garmin told me south or north for example, when it was too late to change line..with split view you see exactly where you need to go.. 3. Bing when you need to make turn. Very helpfull feature.. Cons: It slow to recalculate; if for some reason you didn't follow it directions it takes 20-30 sec to recalculate.. Also pretty buggy software...However, in case with my late 4040, Magellan has released 2 updates and it fixed a lot of bugs. 4250 already has update to fix some bugs, hopefully they release more... In worst case I bought it from Costco...GPS don't have 90 return policy. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture clarity, Good shutter speed and focus, gives good results especially in nature photography, average results for portraits. 
Cons:. Performance not up to the mark during the night while using the sync flash,. 
Summary:. I have bought this camera as a first buy in the world of digital SLRs. Of course I have not been able to get the same performance as compared to film cameras but that is not practical as well. Shooting in sunlight is fun but things are bad when it comes to shooting in low light. Also the 3 frames per second claim is not convincing. Overall I would like to say that it is a good buy for novices and professionals would find it average as per the investment is concerned.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, body construction and configuration, completeness of menus. 
Cons:. 200 speed flash, matrix metering over-exposure. 
Summary:. I have used Nikon cameras since 1994 (N90, N70, F-100, Coolpix 990). I have had the D80 body (I use a 24-120 Nikon lens) a week and a half and took over 100 pix outdoors and indoors. I am very pleased. But I have to follow Ken Rockwell's advice and use -0.7 exposure compensation, or more, for daylight outdoor photos due to metering problems (Nikon needs to fix this!). As an advanced amateur I have almost all the controls and options I would ever need with the D80. I'm sure that the D40 and D40X would have been cheaper and great too, but the D80 is fully compatible with my Nikon lenses and the others are not.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pictures are amazing. 
Cons:. I haven't reached that point yet. 
Summary:. I got this camera from Costco few days ago.. It came with 18-55MM and 55-200 Lenses.. I had been taking pictures with the camera that is in my Sony camcorder and always wanted to own a DSLR and finally got it.. I am not an expert but very much interested in learning about photography using these camera.. Here are some questions I have:. 1. What else do I need to buy apart from the 2 lenses. I will be using this camera mostly for family, friends etc... I see there are filters, wide angle lenses and so many other accessories.. 2. How to decide of when to use the 18-55mm or 55-200mm lenses.. 3. Also when I am taking pictures under night potrait mode I am getting the images blur/shaky. I even tried to take using table for support. Do I need a tripod in this case or do I use the manual mode setup.. Thanks for you help.. If possible please send answers to my email id: Kandadi@yahoo.com. 

$$;
Pros:. easy automatic features, and lots of advanced features. 
Cons:. can't default the flash to OFF. 
Summary:. Great camera with nice automatic and advanced features.. 

$$;
Pros:. very simple to get good pictures with pre program modes. 
Cons:. not so good software to retouch pictures. 
Summary:. takes good pictures, easy to adjust levels and settings, easy to correct picture on the camera, but if you need more elaborate work on picture the software does not give you a good tool to work with pictures.. overall good camera for the price i was expecting canon will give us a good software to go along with the quality if the camera. 

$$;
Pros:. IT has a new 10.2- megapixel &#38; CCD ImagingSensor.. 
Cons:. They say that the buttons on the D70 are the same on the D 80.. 
Summary:. I have always shot with cannon's my oldest son who has a degree in in photo journalism he shoot's with a Nikon. He has done some great work,he works with the D70 I've been waiting to see what Nikon would bring out next I like that the LCD screen is gone from 2" to 2.5" I wish they could have kept the speed that the 70 had but sometimes you have to give a little to get alot.. 

$$;
Pros:. Improvements on D70. 
Cons:. Flash issues. 
Summary:. I will add the d80 body to my present set of lens for the d70.. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid Body, Great Chip, Possible Bargain. 
Cons:. Lacking Custom Profiles of D90, Not A Good Value at Full Price. 
Summary:. If you can't get this for $200 less than the D90, then just go for the D90. If you can get this for $100 less than the D90 and the $100 is really important to you, like really important, then just get this camera. Good camera, great pictures, you'll love it. Are there advantages to the D90? Yes...but those advantages are valued user-by-user. Definitely would NOT trash this camera...really great build by Nikon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful Pictures. 
Cons:. Surprisingly Large and Heavy. 
Summary:. This camera was great 1 year ago...but it sits in an odd space today. If you want a quick and convenient traveling SLR...Look at the D40/D40x if you want a more professional camera...go to the next models up the line....

Pros:. Everything while it was working. 
Cons:. Lasted 20 months then it stopped taking pictures while at my daughters first soccer game.. 
Summary:. Functionality is great durability is poor.

Pros:. Picture quality, lens options, less sensitive to light than D40. 
Cons:. Over exposes, D40 is just as good and much less $$$$. 
Summary:. I have been involved is DSLR photography for many years and shoot part time. Here is my take on why you shouldn't buy a D80:. I would assume that most people who are looking at the D80 are probably entry level shooters. I own a D80, but I recently used the bought the excellent D40 and would completely recommend the D40 over the D80.. Why would I recommend Nikons entry level DSLR over the D80?; a camera that would appear more advanced? Read on..... Firstly, the D40 uses exactly the same sensor as the D80. Same technology for almost half the price.. The D40 is much more sensitive to light because it defaults to ISO 200 unlike the D80 &#38; D40x which default to ISO 100. This makes for sharper images. Even the overpriced D40x can't compete with the D40 because of it's sensitivity to light (the most important part of photography).. The D40 flash sync speed (ask any pro photographer how important this is) is 1/500 second whereas the D80 is 1/250 second (may not sound like much, but it makes huge difference when shooting with a flash). Worried about 6 Megapixels versus higher? Don't be sold on the camera manufacturers claims that bigger is better when it comes to MP's. Large Megapixel sizes don't mean a thing. Megapixel size is targeted towards the average uninformed consumer and is a way for corporations to get people to upgrade to newer cameras. Unless you are shooting large poster size prints you don't need anything bigger than 6MP's. At 6 MP's you can makes great prints up to 12 x 18 inches. Personally I have never printed anything bigger than that.. The flash on the D40 is the same as the D80. If you want to create great indoor photo's, I recommend buying the SB400 speedlight for the bounce feature. Bounce flash is the holy grail of indoor flash photography because direct flash ruins photo's and washes out the colors.. The lens on the D40 (18 - 55mm) is a jewell of a lens. It is one of the best Nikon lenses I have used (I have some expensive lenses). It also weighs next to nothing so along with the camera, it makes for a very comfortable carrying experience. My D40 + lense weighs the same as my D80 body with no lens! Other DSLR's I have owned become tiresome because they are so big and heavy. The D40 is really a joy to use; hard to explain but one in your hands and you will understand. It just feels so comfortable in your hands!. The LCD on the D40 is so sharp and clear (same LCD as D80), only the D300 is better.. Some of the more technical aspects the D40 offers are full RGB histogram (through the well hidden Color Balance option), full auto ISO (it really works, you can even shoot at 3200!), 3 point Auto Focus (3 is enough, don't buy into the hype of needing more), battery life is excellent (I have gotten over 1,000 shots off one charge).. Most importantly, you can get fantastic colors using the saturation feature in the menu options. Colors are vibrant using this along with the Color III mode.. Bottom line, the D40 will take as good if not better quality photo's than the D80. I don't even use my D80 anymore since the D40 takes great photo's and is so light to carry around.. I would purchase a D40 vs a D80 (next step up is really the pro D300) any day of the week. The extra money you save can be spent on the excellent SB400 Speedlight flash and the excellent Nikor 18-200mm VR II zoom lens!. At the end of the day, remember having a more expensive camera will not make any better shots than a cheap camera (google photo's people have taken on camera phones if you don't believe it).. You can pick up the D40's now for about $479, lens included with shipping. Just make sure you visit www.resellerratings.com and research the company you are purchasing from. There are a lot of scam sites out there. I buy most of my camera equipment from buydig.com and beachcamera.com (no I don't work for them).. Hope that helps..

Pros:. Large viewing screen. 
Cons:. to light in weight. 
Summary:. Does not have the feel that a professional camera should posses. Cannot synchronize flash at speeds higher than 200, that is not good for fill flash when shooting outside in sunlight.. Also flash card dosen't hold enough memory.. I believe the Nikon D70's is a much better buy for the money.. I would not recommend this camera to the professional shooter..

Pros:. more megapixels, larger LCD. 
Cons:. Not as good as the D70s or even the D50. 
Summary:. I have been disappointed in the performance of my new D80. First the L.E.D. viewfinder is not bright enough to be visible in bright sunlight and it is not adjustable. Secondly it is slower to focus no matter the setting or lens used. Most annoying is its slow rate of actually taking pictures. It is nowhere near the advertised rate of 3fps. The manual actually says that you can get up to 3fps if you do not use the autofocus feature. Why would I spend $1000 for an auto focus camera that I cannot use in the autofocus mode if I need to snap off picture quickly which I do as I phtograph fast moving trains? Also the 18-135 lens it came with is mediocre at best but I can live with that as I have many of the older AF Nikkor lenses. What I am very displeased with is the dim L.E.D., the slow autofocus and the slow frames per second. I do not have these problems with the D70s or the D50. Thery are excellent cameras and a good buy.Is it possible that my individual camera has problems or are these problems with other D80'? I would very much appreciate it if others who have this camera might report their experience with the three glitches I mentioned..

Pros:. Good quality photos. 
Cons:. Defective camera. 
Summary:. I love Nikon products, don't get me wrong but personally I think that the D80 sucks. I have a constant issue of the f-stop flashing "F--" and I can not take pictures until I make the problem go away, which usually requires me to remove the lens from the body and then reattach it. The problem seems to resurface again and again every several uses and the problem seems to worsen the longer I have the camera. I have had two D80's since June of '08 due to this issue and the second one had this problem the minute I pulled it out of the box. I attended a local Nikon school this weekend I made a point to ask about this issue and even a Nikon technician told me he did not know what was wrong and that I would have to exchange it. Immediately upon me asking, many fellow photographers that overheard my conversation joined in saying that their D80's did the same exact thing. Bottom line? Do not buy the D80. I myself am going tomorrow to exchange mine for a much better and less defective D90..

Pros:. looks nice/ nice view finder/ works good for action photos. 
Cons:. too complicated/ does not adjust to lighting/blurry pictures in lighting. 
Summary:. I purchased this camera for action photos but works terrible indoors. Very difficult to adjust to indoor lighting or dark settings. If you want to take good pictures carry a spot light all the time or a tripod. I hate it.... I missed out on good kid photos. I could have bought a cheaper camera and get better photos..

Pros:. Good hardware. 
Cons:. Disappointing customer service. 
Summary:. In an effort to maximize its profits, Nikon sells the same product at different prices around the world. Low priced versions of the product are plentiful in the US and when unbeknownst to me I purchased an international product, Nikon told me that they wouldn't even stand behind their own product. No warranty. No firmware updates. No software updates. No support. And they blamed me.. But wait, there's more. I called Nikon prior to purchasing. I visited their website and no where did it say, nor did anyone tell me to beware of international product. To this day the website doesn't even notify customers that you must buy from an authorized reseller.. I've always thought of a Nikon as a top notch brand, but despite the fact that the problem is their own making, they choose to blame the company. Take my advice and buy from a customer friendly company like Canon..
