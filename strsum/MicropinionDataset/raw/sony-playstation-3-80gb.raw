Pros:. Bluray, Gaming, Bravia Sync, Wifi Networking, Media Center, Motion Sensing. 
Cons:. Games on Bluray are Expensive. 
Summary:. Decision to buy a PS3 or Xbox has been daunting a lot of people around the world. I guess a lot of reading and research led me to. buying the PS3 finally. And I strongly believe that I made the right choice. I would also agree that a lot of people will disagree with me and say otherwise. I don?t blame those people since it?s just a matter of choice in the end. So let me list down the features and rationalize my decision hoping it would help some aspirants out there.. Now for my findings:. - In terms of she. View next photo | Delete Photoer graphics processing power, the multi core processing power of the PS3 take the cake over Xbox any given day. I have played Halo-3, Gears of War etc on the Xbox and I found them very exciting however once I was playing games such as Uncharted 2, God of War etc on the PS3, I realized what I was missing out on.. - Bluray: HD content required a lot of space. Bluray disc can hold upto 50 GB. Why soo much space? To start with, 2010 will see games such as Final Fantasy XIII which will be need about 28-30 GB of space. So on an Xbox, it would be offered on multiple DVDs while on PS3, it will be neatly available on once single Bluray disc.. - The PS3 controller is a 6-Axis motion sensing game pad. The ones on the Xbox do not have motion sensing. Games such Little Big Planet on PS3 showcase motion sensing.. - I am using a Sony Bravia 32? Full HD model so the PS3 just works it seamlessly. The TV remote can control basic functions of the PS3 when I am watching movies etc. Also the Bravia Sync Feature is a boon. Switching off the PS3 will power down the TV and vice versa.. Some points I noticed between PS3 &#38; Xbox:. - Internal Hard Disc: for a change sony did something really commercially viable. The HDD inside the PS3 is a standard 2.5? SATA and you can easily swap it with a higher 500GB without voiding the warranty. The PS3 is offered in 120 &#38; 250 GB models. I am using a 120 GB Slim. Xbox comes with a proprietary HDD casing which is way more expensive.. - Controller: one of the smartest things I noticed was that the 6-Axis controller comes with an inbuilt rechargeable battery pack. Unlike the Xbox which needs standard AA size batteries to power it up. And since the force feedback motors tend to consume a lot of power ? the Xbox controllers get drained soon. While the PS3 controller recharge using standard USB port and last a longer time.. -The power adaptor of the PS3 is in-built while the one on the Xbox is a huge power brick which sits outside emitting heat.. Conclusion:. For me the choice was made. After reading tons of reviews and doing a lot of ground work, I put my money on the PS3 Slim and so far I have been very happy with my decision. Most of the games now a days are Multi Platform. Same game available on both machines. I would say graphics wise I did not notice any difference between the Ps3 and Xbox. However I did feel somewhere that Uncharted 2 had some fab graphics somewhat better than Xbox. As a complete media center - PS3 completes my setup @ home. I have a Logitech z2300 hooked up with my PS3 and it churns out some amazing sound effects. But then its ur preference ultimately. I cannot tell you to go for a PS3 just coz I like it. I would suggest you try playing on both for sometime and then make ur choice. I am an avid movie watcher - and I have my Ps3 on Wifi so I can stream videos, photos &#38; music off my laptop directly and seamlessly.. Games like Uncharted 2, God of War 3, Little Big Planet etc look great on the PS3. I think the PS3 is more future proof when compared to the Xbox.. PS3 is available in 2 Models in India:. PS3 Slim 120 GB: 19990/- (possible discount upto 1000rs). PS3 Slim 250 GB: 22990/- (You can get a Game free such as God Of War 3). Features:. - The PlayStation 3 uses the Sony, Toshiba, IBM-designed Cell microprocessor as its CPU, which is made up of one 3.2 GHz PowerPC-based "Power Processing Element" (PPE) and eight Synergistic Processing Elements (SPEs).. - Graphics processing is handled by the NVIDIA RSX ?Reality Synthesizer?, up to 1080p HD.. - 256 MB of XDR DRAM main memory and 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory for the RSX.. - Bluetooth 2.0, Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0 and HDMI 1.3a. Wi-Fi networking.. - Up to 7 controllers connected via Bluetooth 2.0. - Media: Bluray, DVD, CD, USB Pen Drive, Portable HDD (FAT32). - Audio: HDMI (5.1 Dolby), Fiber Optic (7.1 Dolby), AV (Stereo). - Video: HDMI upto 1080p Full HD, AV (Standard HD).

Pros:. Sleek, Upconverts my DVDs, Plays all my Blu-ray discs, and can stream photo, video and music from my Vista Ultimate PC. It has a cool photo gallery feature when displaying photos from my SD card.. 
Cons:. Does not support Wireless-N.. 
Summary:. I've always bought SONY products for all my videos, starting from my BetaMax to my camcorders. And it was either a set-top SONY Blu-ray player or PS3. After some research, it was clear that PS3 was my choice. Not only you get a superior Blu-ray player with Bluetooth remote (where I don't have to aim my remote), you get a high-end console for slightly more than what you pay for the dedicated set-top system. Between watching Blu-ray movies and upconverted DVD, I get to play some cool games. My favorite is still the Burnout Paradise. It's graphics and physics are unvelievable.. Yes, it cannon compete with XBox for sheer number of game availability, but my friends had to replace their XBox 360s several times. They're also noisy and gets hot unlike my PS3. The noise issue is very important when you're also using it for your home theater, and I don't have that problem with mine. PS3 is silent. I have mine hooked to 46" Samsung HDTV and Bose acoustimass surround system. I have no regrets with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-ray, Blue Tooth support, Built in WiFi, Comes with a rechargeable controlller, Free playstation network accounts, HDMI &#38; 1080p Support.. 
Cons:. PSN isn't quite up to xbox lives community. Playstation Home is the dumbest thing they could have made.. 
Summary:. PS3 is the best console available hand down!. 

$$;
Pros:. -Blu-Ray. -Free Online-Gaming. -Wi-FI. -Chargeable controller. -Motion controller. -Playstation Home. -Design. 
Cons:. -Game library not as great as competition. -Dust, finger-print magnet. -Can't connect iPod Touch to it.... 
Summary:. People may have noted I didn't put price as a con. I think that when you have 20 GB more memory then the 360, and free online play, built-in WI-FI and you don't have to pay for batteries. You really SAVE money with the PS3. I really like the online play... don't understand how Xbox Live is better. Design is nice but is a fingerprint magnet. Controller is nice, motion control is nice added feature... but not even close to the Wii. Yes the game library is better on 360, but there is a lot of exclusives for PS3. Infamous, Resistance 1 &#38; 2, LittleBigPlanet, and Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. Multi-media is great... music, pictures, movies. But lets remember its a game console. I think its alot better then 360.. 

$$;
Pros:. EVERYTHING. 
Cons:. PRICE OF CONSAL. 

$$;
Pros:. Great console and blu-ray player, graphics is impressive, free multiplayer gaming, surfing the web is rather easy also. If you open the front cover, I believe there's a couple of memory slots there.. 
Cons:. Not really any exclusive must-have games available (yet?). DS3 has to be purchased separately and not HDMI ready.. 
Summary:. This product is definitely worth the cost if you're a multimedia and gaming person, a gaming console and blu-ray player altogether.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great exclusive games lineup, hardware reliability, easy to upgrade hard drive, excellent Blu-ray playback, tons of media features, nice design, plays PS1 and PS2 games (some models), nice DVD upconversion, free and robust online service.. 
Cons:. A little more expensive than the other consoles.. 
Summary:. I own both a PS3 and an Xbox 360 and I find the PS3 to be a better console all around. First of all, the PS3 is a reliable console and the value of that cannot be underestimated. I have had my 360 die on me 3 times and I am tired of worrying about it giving out on me at any time. I just want to play games and not have to worry too much about the console dying --the PS3 gives me that peace of mind.. The PS3 also has the best selection of exclusives for my taste. Games like Uncharted, MGS4, Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, Resistance 2, Heavenly Sword, Flower, Warhawk and many others, are simply unrivaled in my opinion.. I also love the fact that the online service is free. PSN gives me everything I really care about and the games run smooth and lag-free. It honestly makes me a little tired of paying for Xbox LIVE when both are providing essentially the same service.. It also happens to be a top-rated Blu-ray player and BD movies look beautiful on my HDTV.. I honestly love almost everything about this console. The price is a little bit higher than the other consoles, but it is worth every penny.. 

$$;
Pros:. A dream come true, Computer-Gaming all in one. :). 
Cons:. Great Product but missing out some details. :(. 
Summary:. Dosent have the US type style (Crad readers, USB E.T.C). 

$$;
Pros:. If you want to have all the bells and whistles for the smallest price this is the perfect console, plus it's a cheap blu-ray player.. -Easy to Use. -Amazing Graphics. -Sleak and Sexy Design. -Some Games Use Sixaxis controller. 
Cons:. -Most Expensive Base Price. -Amount of Games are Growing Fast but still more limited than Xbox 360. -Online Network is great and free but not as good as Xbox 360. 
Summary:. It was a tough decision on whether to buy a Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 but after much research and reading reviews I decided to buy a PS3 and after buying the PS3 and playing both the Wii and Xbox 360 much since then I still believe I made the absolute best decision. 

$$;
Pros:. Games out there are amazing. As good a selection as the 360.. Visually stunning.. I got mine for free.. 
Cons:. The only con I have is the price, but that wasn't a problem for me (see my pros; it really works; honestly).. 

$$;
Pros:. It has a very nice design, the XMB is very convinent, and it has very good performance. The wifi is also nice. 
Cons:. There needs to be an easier way to turn it off, rather than using the remote to go through a couple different screens to find the "turn off" option.. 
Summary:. Very good graphics, loads blu-ray's fast. Wifi is convinent, very nice design.. 

$$;
Pros:. PS3 plays every game in full high definition. I highly recommend this console for gaming and Blu-ray movie watching. I recommend you to check out http://www.squidoo.com/best-blu-ray-player for information on what is the best Blu-ray player this year.. 
Cons:. I can't think of one.. 
Summary:. I recommend it for gaming and Blu-ray movie watching at full high definition.. 

$$;
Pros:. Firmware upgradeable Blu-Ray player. Works with streaming Nextflix. Easily hacked to run Linux and that is a supported hack (aka doesn't void your warranty) as well as installing new hard drives.. 
Cons:. None.. I only paid $199 for mine via the Sony Style card.. $200 of any purchase over $349 with no interest and no payments for 12 months.... 
Summary:. Very happy with my purchase. Didn't get it as a gaming system even though I went to Amazon and purchased 3 of last years top games for $19.99 each instead of the $55+ new games go for now.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like this console and give it a perfect 10. I recommend you to go check out http://www.squidoo.com/playstation3shopping for the best price on playstation 3 console and games.. 
Cons:. I can't think of one.. 
Summary:. I am an electronic sales and I highly recommend this console to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays all blurays and DVDs with ease, spectacular HD graphics for video games. 
Cons:. None so far, other than it was rather pricey.... 
Summary:. I am looking to buy a secondary bluray player, but after reading reviews on CNET and other websites, it seems like the only one that does it right, every time, is the PS3. Apparently Samsung hasn't solved bluray yet, every new iteration (1400, 1500, now 1600) is plagued with software issues. Why is the PS3 still the only player (and yes, I realize that playing movies was not the intended primary function) to get it right? I've had mine for about 8 months and it has never spit out or refused to play any bluray (i've probably spun about 50 different blurays in it by now) or DVD (I have about 350-400, and I've played old discs and new ones without experiencing anything). It loads quickly, runs quiet, and produces an excellent picture. In short, it does what it's supposed to do.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best quality in graphics best picture quality in all movies never been online with xbox but so far online is ok on ps3 but could be faster. the wireless controllors are better than the controllors for other game consoles.. 
Cons:. online could be faster. other than the online, nothing else seems to be a problem for me. I only had my ps3 for about 4 months.. 
Summary:. ok, I'm not the type to say which game console is better that the other, but I like the ps3 because it does what most of the other game cosoles do, play games and it can play dvd's. I'm not much of playing games but the games have good graphics.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wireless internet, Ethernet Jack, Full HD capability, Blu-Ray reader, Internet browser, big Hard Drive, great game selection, better priced then the XBOX 360 with the same accessories.. 
Cons:. ________NONE_______. 
Summary:. The overall BEST gaming console available, and, even when other consoles have the same specs, they are more then $70 overpriced then the PS3.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the expansive cross console and PS3 only titles that are availible, the online is free, it has a web browser, and its got amazing graphics, and its better then the 360.. 
Cons:. Some of the games leave something besides nice graphics to be desired, and it pretty big.. 
Summary:. Its a system that has many great games like The Metal Gear series, and uncharted drakes fortune just to name 2. The number of online players and games is good. And the 80GB is larger then that of any current system. 

$$;
Pros:. Blue-ray players, awesome exclusives, wireless connection, high quality games, and big hard drive with a low price. 
Cons:. i love it.. 
Summary:. PS3 is a amazing multimedia product with everything included. The best Blue-ray player in the market and high C/P value. it has lots of amazing games like Killzone 2, Metal gear solid 4, Uncharted, Little big planet and more. If you want to pay the least money and get all the features, go get a PS3 !. 

$$;
Pros:. Best gaming experience I've seen on ANY CONSOLE!!!!!. It's got all of the hardware you could want.. 
Cons:. Price could be a little lower.. 
Summary:. It just works. The games rock, and it has Blu-ray!!!.

Cons:. See below.. 
Summary:. PS3 &gt; WII &gt; 360.

$$;
Pros:. Blu-ray. Best looking games available on a console. WiFi. Controller design. 
Cons:. None that I see. 
Summary:. If you want the best quality gaming experience, and to spend your money wisely in this hurtful economy, then go with the PS3 you'll be happy you did :). 

$$;
Pros:. I like that you can go online for free!!!!!!!. 
Cons:. I like every thing, theres nothing to dislike!!!. 
Summary:. BUY THE PS3!. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray. superior visuals to any system out there. Great selection of games. good wireless controllers. PS3 Home. DOESN'T FREAKING FAIL EVERY MONTH... (cough cough xbox cough cough). Never makes noise while I play. 
Cons:. Some very minor issues with the online gameplay, but otherwise perfect.. 
Summary:. The PS3 is the most powerful system on the market, and by far the most reliable. Its selection of games is superior to the XBOX's, and FAR superior to the WIi's. My sister got a Wii for christmas, and I can tell you from experiance that after one month of Wii sports, brawl, and some twighlight princess, you will beome INCREDIBLY BORED WITH THE SYSTEM. I found that after a certain point I stopped having fin playing on it. The PS3 has never given me that feeling. It also is nice because I don't use it on a HD TV, but it still looks comparable to the 360 on and HD TV. It is considered one of, if not the, best blu-ray player on the market (according to CNET). It has PS3 Home which is really cool, and unlike the XBOX's cheap avatars that look suspiciously similar to mii's. I have heard from gameinformer, and others that they are ashamed by their avatar because everyone looks like a complete loser, even if they aren't. The PS3 is very quiet while I play, and I have played with a friend for 5 hours during a sleepover, and when we turned it off, it was as cool as when we turned it on. So, that was what I really had to say, I consider the PS3 the best system on the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. blu-ray, ps3 exclusive games, everything so simple. 
Cons:. needs a re-look of the emb-menu like the 360. 
Summary:. great console love it. 

$$;
Pros:. First of all, 1080p, blu-ray, slick design, great games, bluetooth (rechargeable) controller and an extremely quiet fan... well en comparason with other gaming console.... cough... cough... xbox 360... cough.... 
Cons:. For the new system, non-PS2 compatibility which is extremely sacrificing since there are so many excellent PS2 games out there, and i suppose no flash card slot but i don't find this to be too much of an annoyance, at all.. 
Summary:. Bottom line this: This by far the best system for HD movie viewing and, most importantly, gaming console you could possibly get in the world, thats right, in the world. Hell, some of their exclusives are an excellent reason for even getting the console (Metal Gear Solid 4,Little Big Planet, Resistance 1 and 2, God of War III, Final Fantasy Versus XIII, Killzone 2, Gran Turismo 5, Uncharted and Heavy Rain). Now, MGS4 is, no matter what people say, the BEST GAME EVER MADE... no, literally, ever. If anybody knows the true meaning of "Gran Finale", this is it. Fallout 3 doesn't deserve it, Grand theft Auto IV should also get game of the year, but it was unlucky enough to get caught up against MGS4 and therefore, loses. The only people who say that MGS4 doesn't deserve game of the year, clearly haven't played it, and if you have a PS3 you absolutely MUST have this game, trust me you won't regret it. Anyways the only down-side to this console is the fact that it won't play PS2 titles, which to me was a big mistake. Give it 2 more years or maybe just one and you'll see the PS3 deserve to be in first place in the console race, just give it some time, and you'll see.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek design, Blu-Ray, Integrated Wireless, Price.. 
Cons:. None I can think of... Price?. 
Summary:. I put price as both a pro and con. Why? $399 is alot of money, however, for a quality BluRay player/Media Center/Internet Browser/Game Console that I can upgrade with relative ease, it was well worth the money. I've owned my system for about a year now and have been loving it since. Even more now. Make this your first BluRay player.. 

$$;
Pros:. i love the ps3 cause it is an all in one media center from gameing to full internet controll,BluRay,flash,sd &#38; pro memory card reader memory card thing is kool cause u can put anything on it an upload it to your ps3 you name it the ps3 can do it. 
Cons:. on cons ps3 is awsome. 
Summary:. THIS EDITOR Jeff Bakalar IS A LIAR R STUIP...For starters I have a ps3 and love it for all it can do he said that the ps3 is not backwards compatible at less with my ps2 games lol. And it does not have just 2 usb ports IT HAS 4 all in front for a key bored ,Mouse, wired controllers , flash drive so u can upload anything u want no your ps3 ,and it comes w/ a game moto storm to me that a bundle , and it has ports for your Memory Stick , SD Memory Card , CompactFlash Card AND FULL ONLINE FROM AOL TO UTUBE GOOGLE WATCH MOVIES ONLINE JUST LIKE A COMP AND HAVE FULL SUSPORT LIKE EVERY 2MONTHS U GET AN UPDATE AND TO PLAY ONLINE GAMES AND TO GO ONLINE IS TOTAL FREE !!!!!?.

$$;
Pros:. Blu-ray. Games. DVDs. Playstation Store. Bluetooth. All-in-one media device. Upgradable HDD. 
Cons:. No HD audio in bitstream. Small Hard drive. Two USB Slots. No Card slots. No backwards capability. 
Summary:. Well, I have the 40GB one, the Spidey Version. While the Cons I have seemed to apply to the new 80GB version they are still the cons of the 40GB Version. I did upgrade my HDD to 320GB, which is great. I love the PS3 and the ability to upgrade the HDD and download HD movies, SD movies, games, trailers and all from the PS Store, which has gotten a lot better. The game titles are getting better as well.. The no HD audio in bitstream is not subject to the PS3 alone, I think that most, if not all, Blu ray dvd players do internal coding.. This is one of the best game consoles to have ever come come out, I am really excited to see what happens next.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cell Broadband Engine, beautiful graphics especially in high-definition, interchangeable hard disk drive, free online gaming and chatting, Home(some have not received an invite but I have), good games of almost every genre, and reliability, and more.. 
Cons:. Expensive, PlayStation Network is not at par with Xbox Live, 2 USB ports, no flash card readers, no PS2 backwards compatibility, you need a hard disk drive to play all games, raises up the power bill.. 
Summary:. I have owned a PS3 before(60GB model) and I love it very much. I like the Cell Broadband Engine because it gives you a smarter A.I to play against. I also like the Blu-ray format because of the media storage and the quality of the hue and picture. The games are great and there are good or great games in almost every genre. I can watch DVDs in HD thanks to its support of HDMI and a firmware update. PlayStation Network offers free online gaming with up sixty players, chatting with other users, and PlayStation Home(as I said, I have tried the beta and it is great). The graphics and physics are very appealing to me. The system has great reliability and excellent hardware. The system is quiet and it does not generate a lot of heat. I like how it has an internal power supply because we would not want to have a bulky external power supply. Let us not forget the built-in Wi-Fi which reduces wires after wires. The 80 GB hard disk is great and it is interchangeable to any size.. There are several problems that this console has. It takes a lot of energy to power it and that leads to a higher power bill. PlayStation Network has a long way to go before it can be at par with Xbox Live. Frame rate for some games tend to have problems. Two USB ports may not be enough for you if you have a lot of USB devices. No flash card reader means you will only have a USB storage device to save content.. I like this product because of the hardware, games, online service, reliability, and media it has to offer. If you like video games or other media or both, then this system is for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu Ray Player, Built in Wifi connector, Hi Definition, Wireless long lasting controlers, &#38; internet connection. 
Cons:. There are no cons excepept for the Xbox 360 which have so many cons i would run out of room!!!!!!. 
Summary:. great machine!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Interface , Fantastic Media center , great exclusive games that give a read HD Performance. Amazing game space with BR-Discs. Plays PS1 and PS2 games without any hangups ( tested on 170 games ) . Just a fantastic machine.. 
Cons:. Small game Library. That will change soon though.. 
Summary:. If your looking for a real HD gaming experience , the Playstation 3 is the only one to cross into that market so far. Best bang for your buck , and this is coming from a hardcore gamer.. 

$$;
Pros:. superior design and interface and still a reasonably priced blu ray player. 
Cons:. although in my opinion the ps3 has a far higher calibur of games than the xbox 360 theirs just not enough of them yet but this should change with little big planet , zillzone 2 and resistance 2. 
Summary:. although slow out of the gate the ps3 is definitely making ground over the competition and the best of all is that we are are still not seeing what the ps3 can really do. In my experience the console has been stable and fast something to consider if reliability is important to you . If your looking for a futureproofed HD console and your wallet will stretch then the ps3 is investment for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great gameplay, great DVD/Bluray player!. 
Cons:. None so far!. 
Summary:. Bioshock, MGS4, Oblivion, Drakes Fortune, all look great on the PS3. INMHO, It is the best DVD/Bluray player available. I'm an early adopter so a card reader and backwards compatibility with PS2 games are not an issue for me. 60 gig has both as well as 4 controller ports. The hard drive can be upgraded easily by the consumer. Great machine!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. 60gb hdd built in, with the ability to play all your ps1 and ps2 games. wireless controllers, 7 of them to be exact. not to mention u can plug all your add-ons into it including ur digicam. Free online play too isnt something to cry over. 
Cons:. from what ive discovered in the 12+ months ive owned 1 the only trouble is internet connectivity..other than that no problems whatsoever.

Pros:. upgradeabilty, HDMI, wireless controler and its sexy. 
Cons:. havnt encountered any.... 
Summary:. I bought and 80 gig ps3 2007 Christmas for myself and a month later gave my xbox360 to good will... ive already upgraded it to 320GB hard drive and all my movies are on it.... my hd tv has never looked so good... but the best thing is after a month of playing my xbox360 the red lights of death appeared and i waited 3 months to get to a new one back then had to buy a intercooler and my second xbox360 crashed all the time now my ps3 hasnt had a single problem and thats why i gave it a ten... plus blu-ray is upgradeable to new profiles... i have always liked sony products and they have never failed me.... also Home. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything I wanted. 
Cons:. NONE to say. 
Summary:. Free online, great games, easy-to-use interface, remote-controller (no more getting situated then having to get up to turn it on!), charging controller is fast, wireless internet available, upgradeable hard drive, hdmi compatible, plus more!. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray, HD Capacity, and WI-FI. 
Cons:. No good games.. 
Summary:. This is one of my highlights for 2007. It is one of the best things that have come out in a long time. It is not only a really good console but a really good Blu-Ray player. If your not a gamer you should still get this considering the fact it is the cheapest Blu-Ray player out. Also if you want to get it get this one or the 60 gb not the 40 or 20 because they either do not have bluetooth, PS@ playback or memory card slots. if you have the money get this. Comparing to XBOX 360 i would get the 360 because it is cheaper, better games, and optional HD DVD.. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in blue ray player, blue tooth, free online, HDMI port, it has ports for reading memory sticks, SD cards and compact flash cards. Built in wireless connectivity. 
Cons:. Controler has no rumble and in need of more killer games.. 
Summary:. Best one out of the rest of consoles out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. full HD, Blu ray and kick ass games. 
Cons:. nothing i can think of. 
Summary:. PS3 is an amzing machine i never have a problem like i did with my previous xbox360. 

$$;
Pros:. cool controllers, touch sensitive power and eject buttons, disc "feeder" not a tray, graphics, framerate, games,. 
Cons:. motorstorm loading time (possibly because it came with the system), pricy games. 
Summary:. I received this as a Christmas gift to replace my 1st Gen Xbox. I was very pleased with the graphics Motor Storm offered, even with my non-HD TV. I never had Xbox live, because I thought it was a waste of money however, the PS3's online marketplace is pretty nifty. You are able to download demos (and still keep playing you're game while you are downloading), as well as obtain videos. Obviously, Motor Storm was the first game I played. The loading times are slow, and online is so-so, BUT a few days later I bought "Resistance: Fall of Man", which has awesome online capabilities, as well as speedy loading and super-high multiplayer frame rate. There is so many good games out and coming out for the PS3&Warhawk, TimeShift, Orange Box, Burnout: Paradise, I wish I could buy all of them right now, but they cost 60 bucks each, so Ill have to wait. This system has impressed me a lot, and I cant wait to see what the future holds for the Playstation 3 system!. 

$$;
Pros:. All the features you could ever want.. 
Cons:. Dust issue, but very minor.. 
Summary:. This machine is THE one to have. It beats its competition by a mile. INCLUDED Blu-ray and DVD upconverting puts stand-alone DVD players to shame. Gaming capability and graphics look amazing, what more could you possibly want?. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture. Wireless controllers are great.. 
Cons:. Online. Dust/fingerprint magnet. 
Summary:. This is a must have for any person who enjoys video games. The graphics look outstanding especially on a HDTV. The wireless controller work excellent. The battery will last for a very long time without needing recharged. Doesn't need a memory card which is real nice. I have all my songs, videos and pictures on it from my iPod. You are able to use a photo as your wallpaper which is a cool feature. I see some complain about no USB port in the back but why do you need one in the back when you have 4 in the front. It was wireless ready which is more than Xbox can say and it works good too. The only issue that I found is that when you go onto the Playstation portal page to play demo's and download games it does not work. Sony says they are working on that. I have played friends and other people online in Motorstorm, NCAA 08 football, and fightnight and the online play is great. I do not see any issues with it. If your a clean freak you will be dusting this almost everyday but thats really the only downfall of this system. That and they need more games to come out but they are getting that going. Once again a must have.. 

$$;
Pros:. It bacicly does all the X-box con do + more. 
Cons:. Not as many games.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blue Ray, PS3 Eye, Web Browser. 
Cons:. Lack of games. 
Summary:. This machine is incredible. I recommend getting the Logitech keyboard (Bluetooh or USB) to take advantage of the browser. PS3 Eye also has incredible features as low res camera and good film/picture editing software. Eye also has amazing game called Eye of Judgment. Free gaming online. I consider myself a responsible adult (35+) but I can see myself getting hooked on this thing. I recommend the 80GB b/c the downloads are coming fast and furious. I also recommend that it become your media center, plenty of room for music and movies. SONY got it right for once!. 

$$;
Pros:. Powerful, durable, dosent get too hot, great exclusive titles, wifi built in, free online play. Blu Ray.. 
Cons:. PSN still lags behind Xbox live, but hey, its free.. 
Summary:. To start this off, let me preface this review by stating that I had owned an XBOX 360 since Early 2007, and it is now August 2009. I loved my 360, it was a great machine, but in comparison to my new PS3, it leaves some to be desired.. My 360 RROD once, and it had to be sent in for a 2 week repair at the cost of 100$ to me. The new PS3 does not get anywhere near as hot as my 360 did, and I feel very good about its construction. The controller is very similar to what xbox offers, but comes standard with an internal rechargeable battery. HDMI output allows true 1080p HD, and PS3 actually has games coming out native in 1080p such as GOW3,while XBox only upconverts to 1080p. Interface is not as good as 360, but does the job, and the PSN, although not yet up to live, is very good for a free service.. Overall, I prefer my PS3 do to its construction, exclusive titles, free wifi and Blu ray, which really does look amazing. Its just more bang for your buck imo at 299.. 

$$;
Pros:. graphics are great.. 
Cons:. sorry sorry sorry internet connection problems. i played four games that i lost connection on and it's not my internet because i have 100% signal. and the fact that sony wants 150 dollars just to look at it is bulls**t. after u spend $500 for it.. 
Summary:. good system but needs some corrections. i don't like the fact that you cannot have your friends over to play on one system they have to be at seperate places or bring their systems over for the majority of the games.. Updated. on Aug 18, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. It's so silent, no ring of Fire, the graphics are absolutely amazing, lovely Blu-Ray Playback, Wireless Controllers. 
Cons:. Ships with only 1 Dual shock 3 controller, Doesn't come with HDMI cable, the games are a bit pricy. 
Summary:. The PS3 is the most powerful gaming console out there and it comes with better graphics or reliability then the Wii or the XBOX 360. 

$$;
Pros:. Built-in Blu-Ray player, awesome exclusive games and other great titles, stunning 1080p graphics, easy-to-use user interface, Playstation Home is very cool, the Playstation Store is loaded with downloads, online service is free, TONS of multimedia.. 
Cons:. Online service has it's issues here and there, but I guess you get what you pay for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing graphics, Blu-Ray player, great exclusive games and other great titles, controllers have built in rechargeable batteries, easy to use interface, tons of multimedia features, free online gaming service, loaded download store, sleek and stylish. 
Cons:. Online service is shaky (you get what you pay for), cannot play music during game, internet browser seems half-done, motion controls are slightly awkward feeling, downloads take a while to complete.. 
Summary:. Even with the above cons, the Playstation 3 is an amazing piece of art. This little fella can do almost every multimedia function on Earth, and it brings a Blu-Ray player along for the ride. The exclusive titles are amazing (God Of War, Killzone, Reistance, Metal Gear Solid, inFAMOUS, Socom, LittleBigPlanet, Uncharted, MotorStorm, Heavenly Sword, and many more). The games are flat out awesome. Along with these great games comes the best graphics ever seen on a game console. The PS3 has built-in HDMI capabilities for FULL HD gaming. The games look so clear and crisp on this system, no joke. You can use any bluetooth headset as a microphone/earpiece for online chat, but it is pretty lousy.. I mean, it works, but there is always static and the voice is muffled. The only major flaw with the PS3 is that since SOny doesn't charge for online service, they don't pu much funding into it... it is unorganized, slow, and downright buggy. It is functional, nothing is broken, but it just isn't as premier as Xbox Live (like I said previously, you get what you pay for, Xbox Live is $50 a year, but it is extremely well-made). Anywyas, that's all I got to say about the Playstation 3. I recommend this system to anyone about 12 &#38; Up. There are some decent family games, but it is more for the teen-adult audience. Honestly, if you're wondering if you should get an Xbox 360 or a PS3, I say just go with your gut feeling, because they are both amazing consoles. Check out my review of the Xbox 360!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great games; Great graphics; Built in Wi-fi; built in blu-ray; 80GB HDD; free online; easy-to-use interface; Nice design; Quiet performance; No overheating problems; Awesome network; no need to pay for additional services (Unlike the 360 and Wii!). 
Cons:. You can't have voice chat while playing a game (You can have text chat during a game, however.) Flash card readers have been removed; Only 2 usb ports now; No PS2 backwords compatibility. 
Summary:. The PS3 is the best console on the market. The PS3 is the best in both gaming and multimedia. It has a superior network. Unlike the 360 and Wii, there's no need to pay for additional services, making it the cheaper console than the 360. Unfortunately, PS2 BC, 2 usb ports, and flash card readers were removed.. 

$$;
Pros:. blu-ray, awesome games, online play (free, unlike xbox), playstation network, high-def, bluetooth, sixaxis controller. 
Cons:. big, must frequently download system updates, pricey. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray built in, massive amount of storage, decent marketplace, lots of great games, online is free, controllers have built in batteries and tilt sensors, good looking exterior, internal fans are very quiet, system is HDMI ready.. 
Cons:. Online can be very laggy sometimes.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought this mainly as a Blu-ray player because I already have a Xbox 360. I can honestly say that this is my favorite out of the two. The PS3 is a much more elegant system, more for adults and gamers.. 
Cons:. Xbox 360 has more gaming choices.. 
Summary:. I am a big gamer playing mostly shooters. I do a lot of research before purchasing and I can say that the PS3 was worth every penny. It is such a great system; great blu-ray player and gaming platform. This system is a steal if you are looking for a blu-ray player. I bought one game for this and it is Killzone 2. WOW! What an amazing game. It has such great graphics, and online play. By far my favorite game I have ever played. The PS3 is a great machine and would highly recommend it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays Blu-ray Disc media, very good graphics with HDMI cables. Upscales DVDs from 480i to 1080p. Large HDD and it can surf the web and stream Youtube video. Very good games. Nice design. Speedy internet. Has bluetooth conectivety.. 
Cons:. No media card readers and Software emulator so it can't play PS2 games and it's only got two USB 2.0 ports. Firmware updates can mess up the console if not careful.. 
Summary:. I got the PS3 as a birthday gift from my dad. I 've had my PS3 for four months and it has been running smoothly. My friend who HATES the PS3 says that it gets so hot you can cook saussages on it. I play Ratchet &#38; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction for up to five hours and the outside does get warm, but not hot. sometimes it even feels cold. The only problem I've had so far is getting The Pink Panther BD to play after I updated my firmware to v. 2.60. But I got it to play. I don't really need the media card readers because I already have a PS2. PS: DON"T HOOK THE PS2 UP TO AN HDTV, IT"S MENT BE PLAYED ON A CRT TV!!!! Anyways I think the PS3 makes a great birthday gift because it supports 1080p unlike the Wii and dosen't get the Red Ring of Death like the Xbox 360!. 

$$;
Pros:. The best part is the standardized parts such as the hard drive and USB ports for adding accessories. The controller feels good and solid. Blu-ray player to play movies.. 
Cons:. Graphics are slightly worse than other systems and PCs is a mystery because of the power of this machine; downloading system updates hijack the system; no HDMI cable included; no game demo disk included.. 
Summary:. The first night out of the box was very disappointing. I couldn't play without first doing an update to both the system and my game (GTA IV). The worst part is that SONY for some reason was unable to make the system download the update in the bcakground -- you cannot do anything while downloading an update??? Isn't this one of the most powerful processors on the planet?. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredible graphics, bluray player.. 
Cons:. Nothing that I can think of. 

$$;
Pros:. Upgradeable hard drive, Blue Ray, Free Online, Cellular Procs, and games, can be used as a linux box too.. 
Cons:. Some install times are a bit long, but no big deal. Depending on wher you attatch to the PSN, your download time will vary.. 
Summary:. For those that are crying over 2 USB ports, add a $5 hub. An HDMI cable would have been nice, you you can find those realativley cheap if you shop around.. Otherwise I have had a very nice experience with this system. Since Little Big Planet came out, my daughter and I have been on it constantly. I have no real complaints, unlike some of the Xbox fanboys thet have logged in. Every system is what you make of it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stream music, movies, and pics wirelessly from PC, Stunning Blu-Ray player, amazing graphics for gaming, expanable hard drive, online software updates, everything....... 
Cons:. Online play....for the gamers. 
Summary:. Ok, early adopter, i have had this product for almost 2 years now, i originally had the 60gb version but then expanded my hard drive space and now have 250gb. Very easy to do, but anyways, the PS3. Depending on what reason you purchase this system, it will deliver. The games are spectacular, when created correctly by developers.....blu-ray movies are crisp, and simply using this as a game console, you will not be disappointed. The price tag may turn people away, but once you do purchase it you will see why you definately get what you pay for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays Profile 2.0 Blu-ray discs, can dual boot into Linux with relative ease, up-converts DVDs and other media, easy networking, easy to buy or rent HD movies from Sony online. Frequent and useful OS updates. User replaceable internal hard disk.. 
Cons:. DLNA / PS3 can only open a few video, music and picture file formats. Only 2 USB ports.. 
Summary:. I have been an occasional PC / Mac gamer in the past, so not having PS2 backward compatibility is not a big deal. I bought the PS3 to play Blu-ray movies, primarily -- and play a few games. I was surprised and impressed with the ability to download movies directly from the PS3. Very happy with this purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. great quality, 1080p hd, slot-loading drive, media card support, nice glassy black finish, light bluetooth controller, blu-ray player, internet browser. 
Cons:. online isnt as good as xbox live, a bit too heavy. 
Summary:. awesome system. perfect for people who need something to store/listen/watch all their videos, songs, pictures, and games. internet browser is good. 

$$;
Pros:. - Best graphics (compared to the Wii and Xbox 360). - Blu-Ray movie. - Backward compatible with PSone and PS2 games. - Comes with the new Dualshock 3 controllers. - 80GB is a lot of storage, for a PS3. - No red ring of death issues like the Xbox 360. 
Cons:. - TOO EXPENSIVE! It's so damn pricy!. - Did I mention it was an expensive console?. - The 80GB+Metal Gear Solid 4 package is over $500. - Expensive. - Very pricy console. - Did I mention this was an expensive piece of hardware?. - The price! THE PRICE!!. 
Summary:. Let's face it, this is the best console out of the bunch! The Wii has terrible 480p graphics that look like an old Playstation 2 or Gamecube from the early 2000 years. The whole motion sensing controls is a GIMMICK!!! Only 3 or 4 Nintendo made games use the motion sensing well, but every single other game use it horribly and this is why it's a GIMMICK! The Xbox 360 is not reliable, it will break down and you will have to send it to Microsoft to have it repaired and you have to take extended waranties! Not to mention if you love movies, well... HD-DVD is dead, so that's out of the question! No Blu-Ray adapter for the Xbox 360 makes it feel worthless!. I own a Dell XPS gaming PC and a Wii... I wanted a new console, and I chose the PS3 because of what it can do over any other console out there... even over my PC!. There's games you can only find on consoles because game developers are afraid of game piracy! So they release games exclusive to Xbox 360 and PS3 only! Because of stuff like that, owning a gaming PC isn't enough! Unless you don't mind missing out on great titles like Soul Calibur 4, Halo 3, Metal Gear Solid 4, Rachet and Clank, Uncharted, Grand Theft Auto 4 and others... then fine... don't buy a console!. But if you do love those kinda games, and you can't get'em on the PC, then there's only 1 solution... buy a console!!!. The Playstation 3 is pricy and it was the only thing that kept me from ever buying one. But seeing as the Xbox 360 has so many hardware flaws (Dead HD-DVD format and Red Ring of Death)... unless the Xbox 360 drops to $199.99 or less, it's not worth buying... EVER!!! Why buy a disposable console when you can pay double the price for a console you could probably keep FOREVER!!!!. I own a Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 and they both still work fine!!! My PS2 is dying a little because I overplayed it, but it still runs!!!! I own an original Xbox and it's DEAD!!! After owning it for 4 years, it died on it's 4th year... 1 year after it's waranty expired, and now I have a paper weight black box that does NOTHING! It sucks! When I heard the Xbox 360 has Red Ring of Death issues, I was ready to avoid Microsoft hardware from now on!. If you're thinking of buying a Wii, Playstation 3 or Xbox 360... here's what I say:. - If you want a pure gaming system, BUY A WII !! There's a good dozen great titles on the Wii, making this console worth buying for games alone!. - If you want a media system, for movies AND games, buy a Playstation 3! It's pricy, but it's a worthy investment!. - If you want a cheap 2-3 year pure console game, buy a Xbox 360! If you think you will not touch your Xbox 360 in 3 to 4 years from now, then buy this "disposable" console!.

Pros:. quiet, sleek, blue ray, cell broadbrand, mgs4, sim card reader. 
Cons:. smudge magnet, no usb in back,. 
Summary:. i currently just bought the mgs4 package bundle, whatever... mgs4 is already a current contender in the game of the year and is a strong contender to win. now whats better than getting a free game thats supposed to be and is in my oppinion the best game made so far for ps3. i love the system and crystal clear graphics. i also decided to buy the game systyem for the games soon to come out.........killzone 2.....heard great things......resistance 2....and fallout 3......not to mention the already out mlb 08 which has the most realistic gmaeplay ever made.....these are just a couple of the new exciting things happening that led me to buy the ps3 not to mention that the ps3 online center is improving.....( but the xbox is to far ahead especially with microsoft). all in all its the uprising game system that is the future of gaming due to the cell broadband processor. its gona be a good competition this holiday to see who sells more the xbox or ps3.... the wii isnt for serious gamers....its a family system.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy ti use.. 
Cons:. Playstation store could be layout much better. 
Summary:. Overall. the PS3 is great!. 

$$;
Pros:. The visuals and sounds are awesome. 
Cons:. ot compatible with universal remotes. 
Summary:. Only flaw with this sytem is that it is not compatible with universal remotes. Sony needs to step up regarding this. The PS3 has earned its place among high-end components in the Home Teater World. To seal its place,it needs to be subject to the control of universal remotes like every other component. Another option is for the makers of these remotes to make one that runs on both IR technology (old but universal) and bluetooth (new and upcoming).. Right now i guess i'll stick to juggling three remotes, cos it doesn't make sense to drop $200 for a remote that is not thruly universal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Powerful, handful of features, Blu-Ray 2.0. 
Cons:. No legacy ports, Backwards compatibility not perfect. 
Summary:. I have the 80GB MGS Bundle and I love it. Its quiet, even when playing games, fast, has Free online, but not as sophisticated as Xbox Live, and has an integrated Blu-Ray profile 2.0 player, which are pretty expencive as standalones. A couple things I can complain about. Backwards compatibility has glitches occasionally since its software emulation but, Sony gives you a site to check compatibility first. There are no PS2 ports on it meaning you need adapters. In my opinion, the perfect PS3 system would have atleast 1 legacy memory card port and atleast 1 legacy controller port to be able to use your classic controllers and transfer over your old gamesaves without having to buy a hard to find $15 adapter which you'll only use once.. I also have to complain that the system on a D-Link WBR-2310 router comes up with random "You have been signed out of the PlayStation network" errors (Router is basically 20 feet away from the system, 80% signal) I think this is just the router but the wireless card in the PS3 could also play a part. I have tried 2 of the same routers and have a couple friends with the same router.. One advantage is that you can use older PC game controllers on it. While not all may work, its still nice to be able to use them.. Overall I think that the system is a great one for gaming and multemedia. You should get this if:. Online play is not top priority (Free PSN vs. Pay XBL). You like platformer games (PS3 has many of those). You want a Blu-Ray 2.0 player (currently one of the cheapest). You don't care about B/C (Though the 360 is worse). You want a computer (can run Linux). One last thing, I call this a pro but could be a con. It is pretty hard to find. Its a pro to me because it means it's selling well..

Pros:. Great Graphics; Blu-ray; PS2 capability. 
Cons:. None..specially when free. 
Summary:. Seriously...a guy I worked with did this and got a PS3 (which also has a blue-ray disc player in it). So, I went ahead and signed up. All you need to do is take about 5-10 minutes. I selected the Stamps.com free 4 week offer. You do need to give your credit card number but only need to keep your account active for 21 days (3 weeks). Therefore, my buddy at work cancelled his around the 23rd day and there were no charges (in fact, they do give you $5 free worth of stamps to print if you want). He actually got 13 other friends to do it and received the 80 GB PS3 with extra controller and one game (you can get just the 80 gb PS3 for 8 referrals)...shipping is free too. They also have $375 or $425 cash you can receive instead of the PS3 (although I'm not sure on this as my buddy only confirmed the PS3).. GET one for FREE!!!

Pros:. blu-ray profile 2.0 compliant, hdmi 1.3, now has dts-master decoding capabilities,. 
Cons:. fan its loud, sometimes it freezes, it's a nice heater for my room, i did not know when i bought it they decreased backwards compatibility.. 
Summary:. It does play blu-ray, some ps2 games, also ps1 games... Small lineup of ps3 games, nice reset feature(press and hold power for 5 seconds). And everything i mentioned above... I was there to buy a console and i told myself when i play games in 2009 what console would be capable of paying games with the best graphics, some neat innovations (six-axis), maybe even watch movies. The PS3 was the only console that can watch blu-ray movies, has true 1080p capabilities(but have not seen any game use it). I was thinking an x-box 360 for halo 3 but then i thought of my friend that went through 4 of them within about 6 months and he is not a hardcore gamer like me... so i said that was immediately out of the picture. The wii is well good and all with the wii remote, but game selection is missing something other than like mario, donkey kong...etc Then i thought well the wii uses 480p i believe which is last gen. Also graphics does look as good as my psp. But does not even come close to ps3.... Final Verdict buy a ps3, anyways I am an rpg gamer and can't wait for FF13, and Kingdom Hearts 3... 

$$;
Pros:. Remote power on! With wireless controlers. 
Cons:. I do not have enough time to play everything out there!. 

$$;
Pros:. BD Player, Awesome Graphics &#38; Audio, Media Server, Internet, Free On-line, etc... 
Cons:. Updates, take awhile and lack of family friendly games. 
Summary:. I reaesrched both X-Box 360 and PS3 and it came down to best bang for the buck. It cost me $569 to get a PS3 w/ 2 controller, game and 5 BD Movies.. With the X-Box, $499 for system w/ 1 controller. I would have had to buy a wireless card to connect via wifi $99, HD-DVD player is $200 (which I found to be inferior), A second controller would be $50 and a game would have been $60, on line play is pay to play $50 a year. And X-Box was having lots of problems, external powersupply, etc... (I just did not like it). So in the end it would have cost me over $1000 to get what I got w/ a PS3 and had to pay to play on-line and prey it did not break.. So I bought a PS3 instead and find in more amazing every time I play it.. Thanks Sony.

Pros:. Blu Ray DVD looks great.. 
Cons:. Price a little high.. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in WiFi, Bluetooth, easy setup, incredible graphics make it an awesome product. 
Cons:. The browser is not easy to use yet and the OS software ability is has not been easy to set up.. 
Summary:. The ability to take this 80GB unit and change out the hard drive for a 120GB, 200GB or 350GB makes it hard to beat. I store movies and music currently and know I will be able to use it for much more. The BluRay DVD drive is great and makes it worth the purchase alone.I dont play many games on the PS3 but my son does and loves it... Awesome product. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-ray player. 
Cons:. short list of new games. 

$$;
Pros:. Powerful, Fast, Quiet, Sleek, Ease of use. 
Cons:. price, Not many games yet, bulky, fingerprint and dust magnet. 
Summary:. i originally got the PS3 to play Blu Ray movies, after getting the system, i realized how nice it was for ALL my media, it's nice to watch and see all my files from my computer through my PS3 to my HDTV. 

$$;
Pros:. When it comes down to everything it does and how it does it......What more can you really ask for?. 
Cons:. We'll wait for the games to match the machine. It's like a super fast race car that you can only drive on a few tracks.. 
Summary:. Look, it's really quite simple. There are those that are content with average and "OK". And so they created the xbox 360 just for you. Now on the other hand there are those of us who prefer the finer things in life and so they built this shiny black machine with so much under the hood that the gaming companies are still trying to catch up to it. That is just fine with me because when they do figure it out microsoft will be back at the drawing board. The xbox "180" might be a nice badge. Let's also not forget that Blu-ray has won the war and that will only make this purchase that much more of a no brainer.. 

$$;
Pros:. exactly like a computer you can add a printer keyboard mouse and even an av or hdmi monitor. 
Cons:. not many good games you will find yourself constantly playing ps2 games. 
Summary:. this thing is great but I feel as if it should have been released as a computer or an entertainment hub... or even a ps4 it's just to advanced it takes alot of power to replace my hp, and it did it is better than most pc's out their and i have mine working on the Linux yellow dog platform made exclusively for the ps3. I even have programs such as lime wire, a windows emulator and even a word processor of which i have used already to turn in an assignment. Now I also own a wii which has a more advanced web browser and better games but does not come close to the ps3's power. The ps3 even has the ability to burn cd's, rip off of memory cards in its media bay and than even import videos photos and music to another memory stick.. curaintly i am using orb on my pc and it can even stream from that automatically which is kind of creepy if you don't know about that when you first sign into your wifi network it kind of just hacks your computer... without me pressing a button it had my pics music and videos ready to view... which i must say is slightly dangerous.. I would have given it a ten if it didn't have all of these computer like features i gave it a 9 cause it tries to hard it does everything except cook and tuck you in at night. It is just not the awesome game system my brawling wii and bioshock360 are.. now i don't want to say that its terrible but it is good because of its graphics but without the graphics it is just another game system which it kind of isn't. If your looking for innovation get a freaking wii along with galaxy and brawl if your looking for shooters with good graphics look for 360 if your looking for an entertainment hub that is sure to replace almost every thing but your surround sound system and hdtv get a ps3.. It's pros are it's cons it is too advanced to be a game system and the fact that you can connect a keyboard, mouse, printer, internal and external hard drive, Linux yellow dog, windows emulators, blue tooth technology and the promise of keeping up to date via firmware upgrades aka service packs. The ps3 should have been sold as a mac and pc killer not a game system.. p.s if you plan to use it as your new pc here are some tips on what you might need a hard drive isn't really needed if you have the 80gig.. ps3 logitech bluetooth media board $80. (this thing is in all in one mouse and keyboard it's wireless so it's great for travel and having a laptop pad mouse in place of the number pad usually found on normal keyboards is genius and works excellent). 120gig hard drive $100. (this is very optional if you have an 80gig ps3 but once you connect to psn and start downloading videos photos and music online you are going to start taking up all that space). sony bluray dvd remote $25.00. (only sony brand and because of the controllers odd control of video playback this is super useful). Play station eye $70.00. (If you are a mac user this will serve as your new photo booth with much more advanced features way better quality than the mac photbooth and even makes games more intuitive while it isn't a wii it is pretty cool and the camera effects will keep you entertained for a bit). bluetooth headset. (super optional at this point because at the moment only a handful of games use headsets to communicate but as of later this year a little known thing called home is coming out were it is exactly like real life in the way of communication although you can use voice emotes and a keyboard you can use your headset to speak also.). and last but definetly not least it's the cheapest most monitor like 1080p screen you will ever lay your eyes on it's gotten wonderful reviews and almost no major complaints. The scepter x20wg-1080p black 20.1 $190.00. (this thing is awesome it has better quality than alot of tv's i have seen it is low priced and not only does it look like a monitor but it is one with the functionality of being used as a normal computer monitor also and man when i tell you windows in 1080p it is impossible not to have a geekgasm their have been some complaints of led bleeding when the screen is all black like in a movie transition or blackout but I have not seen anything as of now another con is the monitor is only available from newegg.com and takes 3 days to arrive but it is worth the wait). i hope this review is helpful in your purchase.. innovation and fun: wii. shooters good graphics:360. Media hub and pc replacement. s3.

Pros:. No red ring of death; Doesn't increase my room temperature 10 degrees; Everything is in a sleek package; I don't have to buy any extras...it's all built in; downloading Demos.. 
Cons:. Should hook up with Apple Quicktime for movie trailers; needs more downloadable video content.. 
Summary:. Nuff' said.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of Hardware for the Money. 
Cons:. Missing Some Basic Necessities. 
Summary:. Never been much of a gamer. My last system was a Sega Genesis 16 that was bought to play EA's NHL games.. What drove me to this purchase? My wife. She got hooked on Guitar Hero at a party. Now, I know that Guitar Hero is available on cheaper systems, but I didn't want to invest in yesterday's technology. Still, it took some research before I finally settled on the PS3. I'm glad that I did.. Out of the box, the system was fairly easy to setup. What puzzled me though was the lack of connectors for HD. Whether you want to connect using HDMI or Component cables, you are going to have to purchase these separately. The component cables will be proprietary for the PS3 while the HDMI cable it uses is standard. Everything about this console is high-end graphics and Blu-ray, yet the supplied connectors won't get you any better than 480p. HDMI cables aren't expensive. Contrary to what sales people at big-box stores will tell you, a $5 HDMI cable will perform just as well as a $100 one. The problem is that you'll have to go online to find the $5 cable.. Once I got my system connected properly, setting it up was fairly straight forward. We purchased the 80GB model because we felt that it was worth $100 to get twice the disk space, WiFi, the card readers, and compatibility with most PS2 games. The WiFi was as easy to get connected as any laptop. Once connected, the system downloaded an update, and within a few moments we were in business.. The system came with MotorStorm (an off-road racing game) and it blew me away. It's amazing the power you get for $500. A $500 PC would never be able to run a game like this. I can't wait to check out other titles.. From what I've seen, an Xbox 360 has similar games that look equally as stunning. So, why get the PS3? The Blu-ray player is what got me. I've been waiting for the HD video disk format war to end before investing in a player. Now my investment is somewhat protected because if Blu-ray loses the format war, I still have a terrific game console. If you own an HD television and have been limited to the HD experience via cable and satellite, you need to take a look at a Blu-ray demo. It's night and day better than the compressed HD you'll get from broadcasters. And the Blu-ray player can upconvert your standard DVD's to make them look pretty close to HD. I've seen other upconverting DVD players, and they don't perform as well as this one. You'll need to shell out $25 for a remote for playing Blu-ray movies. There is no infrared port on the unit, so the remote must be Bluetooth. You can use the Sixaxis controller, but you'll tire of it's limitations quickly.. Another cool thing is the media reader. We had the family over for Christmas. Everyone was taking pictures with their digital cameras. We used the PS3 to view pictures as a group. I saved the good ones that I wanted to have right to my PS3's hard drive.. I can't tell you that a PS3 is superior to an Xbox or a Wii. There are too many variables. As a full featured entertainment system, the PS3 gets the nod in my book.. 

$$;
Pros:. What's not to Love. 
Cons:. Still Pricy and Wating for more games. 
Summary:. I mean what's not to love about the PS3, HD Gaming, Blueray Player (1080p) by the way, 80gig HD, Web Browsing, PSP like OP System.. I mean you don't only play HD games, you could watch HD Movies (Blueray) at the full 1080p and store your files in the 80gig HD for later browsing, go online, play old PS2 Games.. The only thing is still very expensive for a lot of people, I got mine at Walmart for 500 with 10 Blueray movies and a free Game, that's why I have to say what not to love..

Pros:. Media capabilities make it great even for people who don't play games, killer tech specs, standardized rather than proprietary components, sturdy and reliable track record. 
Cons:. Contributions to global warming are felt within minutes of use, would have been nice to have included an HDMI cable. 
Summary:. I have really great friends; one of them gave me this console on the day after Thanksgiving. Not even Christmas, mind you, but Black Friday. Just gave me one... Wow.. The first thing I noticed upon unboxing it was familiar desktop and laptop computer parts; the SIXAXIS controller had not some weird Sony proprietary parts, but an ordinary USB cord, with a standard small end and big end. My research beforehand also showed that even the hard drive is a standard laptop SATA drive; if I wanted to, I could swap it out for a 250 Gig Western Digital drive, just like the one I put in the laptop I'm using to write this review. Sony did a complete 180 degree on this, as their historic use of proprietary parts instead of interchangable components is legendary. (The PS3's sibling PSP's reliance on UMD and Memory Stick instead of regular SD cards, as well as limited support for common video formats, was a deal breaker.) I'm really glad to see Sony changing its ways here. The USB ports have great plug-and-play capabilities, too; I plugged in a standard USB keyboard and without any additional buttons to push could type entries on registration forms and name blanks.. My console came with the game "Motorstorm," which is a fun racing game, but I got a better taste of the true capabilities of this console when my already nice friend also threw in "Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction." Playing the first level showed off both the rendering capabilities of the cell processor itself and some of the fun gadgetry capabilities of the console, such as the motion-sensing controller. I know, it's not the same as the Wii's tennis and bowling prowess, but it's still cool to control a character through motion wirelessly with a handheld controller.. The menu-driven interface is convenient and simple, making this device, as powerful as it is, accessible to novices as well as experts. However, the former might have a hard time getting used to PlayStation controller conventions. Since I'm not myself a heavy gamer, aside from the visual shock of going into a seventh generation console, I did have to get used to using a game controller to navigate system settings such as wireless networking or to browse an online store.. But, even people who never play a video game may want this console for its remarkable media capabilities. Aside from being one of the cheaper and yet one of the better Blu-Ray consoles, a firmware update recently also made it one of the best 1080p upscaling DVD players. Coupled with a user-replacable hard drive and USB expansion ports, one could use it as a digital media hub. (Granted, the remote control is sold seperately and is bluetooth-based, meaning adapting a universal remote means going with third party infrared work-arounds). User replacability of the hard drive aside, I still recommend this console over the 40 Gig for media purposes because of both the extra two USB ports and the memory card readers--both Memory Stick and SD, and even CF are included. (For gamers, I would absolutely insist on this in lieu of the 40 Gig model because of the lack of PS2 reverse compatability in the latter. My wanting to play "Okami" was a reason for rejecting the 40 Gig Spidy 3 version in my research even before my friend got wind of my interest in this console.). Another selling point for the PlayStation 3 is that its hardware is durable and sturdy. Early models of the XBox 360 are having enough problems with permanant failure that they have their own special name for it. (Not a good thing for Microsoft, which is still recovering from a reputation created by the legacy of Windows 98.) The internal power rather than an extra transformer brick is nice. That said, one should note that the console tends to warm up the room pretty quickly when it's on. The high end inards also tend to need more wattage, making this the most power-hungry of the new gaming consoles, or for that matter any gaming console short of a Falcon Northwest Mach V with rediculously unneccessary extra GeForce 8850 graphics cards stuffed in for bragging rights. But, you have the console itself to remind you to plant a tree to offset its carbon footprint, by raising the temperature of your own environment a few degrees.. All in all, its a superb piece of hardware. It's a killer game console that, while lacking very many of its own titles, can play a lot of PS2 titles (if you make sure to get the right one; for you die-hards, you might want to backtrack and look for the 60 Gig model that achieves PS2 backwards compatibility by having rather than hardware emulation a tiny, shrunken down little PS2 physically stuffed inside) until the gaming industry catches up. It doubles as a Blu-Ray player, and its Cell processor's multithreaded nature makes it one of the best 1080p DVD upscaling systems out there. It triples as a hard drive media player that, with minimal work and a trip to Best Buy, could hold over 200 Gigs worth of mp3s, videos, and pictures. And, appearantly soon it will quadruple as an online social networking tool that, unlike the XBox 360, doesn't require a monthly fee. (I'll have to see whether or not that works out.) If you're building a bleeding edge home theater system, it's almost a must--if you're going to spend $500 on a Blu-Ray player, why not get the one that also has a built-in hard drive and just happens to play games like there's no tomorrow?. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice design, Synaxis feature is awesome, Very user friendly. 
Cons:. Kinda big and heavy, No vibration in controllers, Short USB cables for controllers. 
Summary:. Just got this unit... havent hooked it up to the internet or a network yet, but... Setup was very user friendly.... Controllers are alot lighter the PS/PS2 controllers. The included usb cable for the controller is very short, so if the battery dies, playing wired kinda sucks, but its not often that that will happen.... The Synaxis feature is really awesome, and makes up for the loss of the vibration sensor in the controllers..... On the other hand, it only works for some games (ie: racing games) however, most games it doesnt work with, you probably wouldnt want it on anyways (ie: first person shooter games). On the down side of things, it is a very large heavy console, but because it looks pretty sweet, you dont mind having it sticking out in the middle of your entertainment system. First time I hooked it up, it was to an older CRT 27" tv... Even on that it was sweet... Its now permanently hooked up to my Sony 46" which is much better, but still need to get the HDMI cable for even better quality. Another (slight) down side is that it wont (at least not that I've found as of yet) take older PS/PS2 memory cards... Cool side to that is that if you use PS/PS2 games, it will create a "virtual memory card" on the hard drive for saving data... Also, you can use smaller (ie: Compact Flash/ Secure digital) memory cards... Over all, its a pretty sweet system. I'd reccomend it for sure!!.

Pros:. Free Ps3 what more can you ask for?. 
Cons:. nothing, just give it a try.

Pros:. save yourself $600. 
Cons:. may take a few weeks, but it is free.

$$;
Pros:. Superior Graphics, Fee Online Service, Growing Game Library. 
Cons:. Game Library Still Catching Up. 
Summary:. With the inclusion of a Blu Ray player, free online service and ever expanding list of features, the PS3 is hands down the best console. Exclusive titles are still cacthing up to the 360, but given that the system has only been out for 1 year, I am willing to wait. Playstation HOME is also coming out soon which will revolutionize the online gaming experience. And best of all, it's free! Once game developers harness the power of the PS3, it will blow away the competition.. 

$$;
Pros:. stellar graphics, elegant design, great functionality, great interphase. 
Cons:. games, games, games. 
Summary:. The only thing preventing me from giving this a perfect 10 is the lack of games and functionality that's oh-so-close. I tried and loved the xbox 360, but for the $$$ you have to go with the PS3. I love the Blu-ray disks and the games that are out look spectacular.. Updates are timely and the online content will only get better. I could envision downloadable movies in the near future. Great experience so far.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its gotten better than the ones that went before it and it has a lot of nice features available in a compact and more sleeker design.. 
Cons:. Its memory isn't much but hopefully can be available with more space next time.. 
Summary:. I'm pretty sure people have thought the new slim playstaion 3 is better and more stylish...well you guys thought right. Prior to its new look, its menu options have varied since the old playstation 3. Its quite ironic that everyone was falling head-over-heels for the old playstation systems. I'm not going to exaggerate the truth. I trust Sony and i'm pretty sure they'll come out with better ones. but don't hold your breath. it won't be here for a while. Its a good system overall and it is something worth bragging about. But its memory space isn't as large as the previous playstation 3 so that part will be marked as a con. Its definitely cheaper so those who couldn't enjoy some ogf its features such as blu-ray and internet can do all that now. And technically, we should thank sony for this because its virtually more than just one component. Its features, such as blu-ray, internet, music player, chat, gameplay, e.t.c can individually be gotten from many stores, and will cost you over $1000. And you guys get it just for $299. Most parents tell their kids that they have it better from their chuildhood, but it is the parents with this system in fact, that have it great. And entirely, if iI gave this system a grade, It would be an (A-). 

$$;
Pros:. Its a great system for gaming, but you might want to keep a PS2 for backup when trying to play old games. 
Cons:. The fact that new models don't have backwards compatability, the ability to play PS2 games.. 
Summary:. A PS3 is an expensive video gaming console that has many pros and cons. Before someone could even think of buying it they should know its capabilities. This information will help you decide if you would be interested in a PS3 or if XBOX 360 would be a better choice for you.. A PS3 has a lot of good features to it. A PS3 can read DVDs that don?t seem to work on old DVD players. It can play games for hours on end, without burning the ring into the disk, an issue that the Xbox 360 has. There is only a fee for the internet itself, no add-ons for playing on the PS3.. The PS3 also has its issues. The internet lags unless you have really fast internet. Only the older ones have backwards compatibility, and remotes for the old ones are scarce. The games cost more.. 

$$;
Pros:. there's to much to count. 
Cons:. it's a watered down version of the original. 
Summary:. this is a great gaming console/blu-ray player. However they're 5 things missing on it that the original ps3 had.. 1. it is no longer backwards compatible(still plays ps1 games). 2. there's no flash card readers. 3. there's no sacd support(which you really don't need). 4. there' only 2 usb ports. 5. there's no chrome accents. don't get me wrong the new ps3s are amazing and I would recommend them in a heart beat. I'm just saying that if you need the features listed above it's not the best configuration for you. however if the missing features aren't a big deal to you go out and buy it, there are a ton of game, the graphics are awesome, and in my opinion it's better than the xbox 360.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's a powerhouse with loads of functionality and entertainment. A great purchase even if you just want the blu-ray player.. 
Cons:. For hard core gamers, such as myself, the PS3 would recieve more props if it had a better gaming library with more exclusive, kick butt, must have, rockin game titles. With the competition, the PS3 would be more praised if it had a price cut, again!. 
Summary:. If you're a electronic wizard, the PS3 is right up your ally, hands down. If you are a gaming lord, they PS3 doesn't totally dissapoint, but would serve better rank with more kick-butt exclusive games. I would also like to see an improvement on the gaming graphics in upcoming titles. Eventhough, the technology is still fairly new and hasn't been completely master, I would defianately like to see some great improvements on game quality, and when those issues somewhat resolve, 360 will start to submerge.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the looks and operating system, absolutely beautiful! The wireless controllers work like a charm. Killer graphics, WiFi, great on-line play (I'm loving Street Fighter IV). 
Cons:. I just wish there was a larger selection of games for the PS3.. 
Summary:. PS3 has everything over XBOX360, in my opinion... looks are a big deal to me, so PS3 has it hands down... however, I feel that PS3 also has greater potential for growth with it's BluRay disk format (larger disk space for game developers to work with) and custom designed graphics processor. If I'm going to blow &gt;$300 on a console, might as well go with one that won't be old in the future, and the XBOX360 is going to get old faster than the PS3.... 

$$;
Pros:. HD Gaming, Blu-Ray player included.. 
Cons:. Only one controller, no remote included for Blu-Ray player? No backwards compatability with PS1 and/or PS2 games? Only 2 USB Ports?. 
Summary:. So, why did Sony discontinue the PS3 console that played both PS1 and PS2 games? Seriously - I can't even buy a new PS3 that will play any of the old games? For 400 or 500 bucks, why only one controller? How about including at least 2? Blu-Ray player, but you have to purchase a remote control because Universal Remotes will NOT control this console? Seriously, you need to spend another $100 just to walk out the door without a single game. The real cost is 500-600 bucks, and having to purchase all new games.. 

$$;
Pros:. many things. 
Cons:. many things. 
Summary:. Just a few things i wanted to point out about the Cnet review of the ps3, just some technical details that were incorrect.. particularly the "cell inside" section.. "The 360 uses more off-the-shelf PC components, while the PlayStation 3's 3.2GHz Cell processor was built from the ground up just for the console.". incorrect here, the 360's processor was also built from the ground up by IBM, as was the PS3's.. "As with the graphics chip, the PS3's Blu-ray drive--which allows for games of 25GB to 50GB in size--has yet to show a big advantage over the 8.5GB limit of the Xbox 360's DVD media.". i assume they meant Cell processor instead of graphics chip here, as the two consoles graphics chips are nearly even, with the 360 having a slight advantage due to unified shaders. so since their nearly even, how would the PS3's graphics chip be an advantage?. "It consists of a single PowerPC-based core with seven synergistic processing units and is the result of a joint effort between IBM, Sony, and Toshiba, which was ironic, considering that Sony and Toshiba were in a deathmatch over Blu-ray and HD DVD.". not a big deal but they probably should have mentioned that only 6 of those SPU's are available to developers, as one is reserved for the OS at all times.. Another thing is that the PS3's GPU has only half the memory bandwidth of a geforce 7800 which it is similar to.. i hope im not coming off as a fanboy here since i do think the PS3 is a great console, i just wanted to point out some errors in the review, apart from which the review is very well written.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the fact that everything is wiresless. The graphics are so realistic compared to any gaming system out to this point. When I purchased my PS3 I recieved five free Blu-Ray Dvds. I love the blue Ray.. 
Cons:. The 80 GB is very expensive and it can't play the PS2 games one it. The online gaming is weak compared to the XBox.. 
Summary:. When it comes down to buying a new gaming system I would recomend the PS3. It can do almost everything out there like playing games, surfing the internet, and playing Blu-Ray discs. It was everything I wanted it to be othere than the fact it can't play PS2 games.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice toy, reminds me a lot of the PS2 when it came out (since DVD was still fairly young). My favorite (only) blu-ray player!. 
Cons:. The store doesn't yet compare to the xbox live store :(. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Graphics, Easy to Connect. 
Cons:. No USB in back, Navigation of Options can be difficult. 
Summary:. I did all the research and was planning on buying a XBox 360 but ended up with a Playstation 3 due to my decision that Blu - Ray will win. I am now glad that I did that. It upconverts well and even my home copied DVD's look better. The games are catching on, but I now dedicate less time to gaming due to graduating from college. The only thing that bothers my very OCD self is that I hate to stick a memory stick in the front and leave the top sticking up. Looks tacky and just bothers me. Other than that, No problems whatsoever and have been pleasantly surprised.. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in Blu-Ray player, absolutely amazing graphics, online service is free, decent game collection, controllers are rechargeable right out of the box, tons of multimedia options, internet browser built-in, easy-to-navigate digital store.. 
Cons:. Very few 'blockbuster' titles, online service can be shaky at times, have to purchase a bluetooth headset to chat online, most features can't be used in game, downloads take several hours to complete, generally terrible friend system.. 
Summary:. The Playstation 3 seems to be more of a powerhouse of multimedianess than a game system, but it does still deliver a few ground-breaking games along with the cheapest format of Blu-Ray. A lot of good features make the PS3 a good buy. Check out my reviews of the Xbox 360 and the Wii to get a better idea of which to buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gaming system and a blu-ray player in one unit.. Cost-effective. 
Cons:. No infrared control port for system integration. High power consumption. Awkward size and shape. Power on only through PS3 controller or switch. 
Summary:. Client asked that I integrate the PS3 into a home theater system. Looks great on the Samsung 63" plasma. However, there is not I/R control port for use with other remote control systems. Had to as the Schmartz USB adaptor for control with the UR remote system. The system is in a cabinet and generates a fair amount of heat when on. As a blu-ray player it is inefficient. It consumes 170 watts versus the average blu-ray player at 25-30 watts. With a Scientific Atalanta DVR and the PS3 in the same cabinet a ventilation fan must run 24/7 to keep down the heat buildup adding to the inefficiencies of the system. The PS3 menu system is creative but awkward and programming the UR remote required many steps to achieve simple commands. An alternate set of direct control commands would be very helpful for integrators..

Pros:. games engine, controller, resolution. 
Cons:. LOUD FAN, bluetooth only. 
Summary:. PS3 is an awesome gaming machine. The graphics are stunning with quick load times and great controllers. the other features such as the media server and the web browser are cool too.. But the MAJOR flaw in the system is the loud loud fan. it's ok when you just start the machine, but it has a 2nd gear that it kicks into about 10 minutes into a game or movie.. Doesn't bother me at all for gaming, but when i'm watching a movie with the stunning blu ray picture and that fan revs up it's really annoying. you literally have to turn up the volume to drown it out.. i can't believe all of the hype about this being a great blu-ray player! The picture is awesome, but believe me, the loud fan REALLY detracts from the experience.. Also, it's a pain not to be able to use your universal remote with it (since it's bluetooth only). 

$$;
Pros:. Its ok...Graphics are good. 
Cons:. Its ok...Graphics are good. 
Summary:. I personally think that Sony did a good job on this, but the price is outrageous. The graphics are outstanding. Yet, i give it a seven, why? Because all you can do with it is sit on the couch, eat chips, and hold the controller. I like the new wireless tech, but i hate the price. I would give it a 9 if the price for the 80GB was $399. But really people, you are only buying another computer with a single OS that plays what its programmed to play.. 

$$;
Pros:. some of the games are great. graphics are good.. 
Cons:. not many good games, online play is not impressive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray. Easily upgradeable HDD. Nice looking machine. 
Cons:. Multi-player interface is a joke.. Online store is improving, but poor when compared to competitors (xbox360). Controller has cheap feel to it and non user replaceable battery. 

$$;
Pros:. everything. 
Cons:. pros are cons. 
Summary:. i expected to be more impressed. i barely use it. 

$$;
Pros:. Great dvd viewing. 
Cons:. Xbox still the better gaming Console. 
Summary:. I have both and xbox360 and ps3 on a high def tv.the ps3 is used more as a movie player than anything else. most games you buy for xbox u can get on ps3 but the xbox i find playes the games better and more of your friends are likely to have a xbox over a ps3. i did notice the picture quality for upconverting picture was beter for the ps3 when watching movies rather than on the xbox , which is also noiser, however the xbox wins hands down because the controller the gameplay and the onine experiance is much better you get what you pay for when it comes to online play.if you want nice cheep blue ray player id buy the ps3... other than that its basically garbage cause its not that apealing either.... 

$$;
Pros:. it already has a lot of games, great picture quality and its easy to play online.. 
Cons:. Its overprices for what you get, it still gets hot.. 
Summary:. I think they should drop the price another 100 and sweaten up the deal by adding a new and cool gmae at on extra price. Otherwise they are going to loose a lot of money and have to pull it off of the shelves every where.. 

$$;
Pros:. Exclusive games like Little Big Planet, Fat Princess and Uncharted.. 
Cons:. Operating system leaves a lot to be desired. Online communication left to game developers which means you'll need a phone to arrange games with your friends for most games.. 
Summary:. If you play by yourself this system is fine. If you like playing online and talking to your friends...get an xbox 360.. 

$$;
Pros:. blue ray, wifi.. 
Cons:. it was fixed 3 times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
Summary:. was fixed 3 times for diferentes reasons and less that 2 years!!! i 'm average game player 2 hours a day sometimes 3 times a week. and the most scary thing is my 2 friends have the same problems with theirs. sony supost to be a respectable bussines but i belive with the ps3 something wrong happed!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Its is great , MGS4 and all the other ones that u can find on 360, BLU RAY LOOKS AWSOME ....however. 
Cons:. ONLY LASTED 2 MONTHS ....... 
Summary:. TO THE REVIEWER OF CNET AND ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT THAT SAID THAT THIS CONSOLE DOES NOT HAVE A RELIABILITY PROBLEM I INVITE THEM TO PUT THIS SEARCH IN YAHOO OR GOOGLE ... PS3 YELLOW LIGHT OF DEATH, THIS IS THE EQUAL TO THE RED RING OF DEATH , I KNOW BECAUSE IT HAPPENEDE TO ME WHEN I TRYED TO PLAY GTA4 , I DOWNLOADED THE UPDATES AND 20 MINUTES LATER IT CRASHED , THE PS3 HAS BEEN IN THE SONY REPAIR CENTER FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS NOW AND MY XBOX 360 ELITE THAT I BOUGHT BEFORE THE PS3 IS STILL UP AND WORKING AND I AM STILL ENJOYING HALO 3 AND GEARS OF WAR , WHILE MY COPIES OF DRAKE GTA4 AND RESISTANCE FOR PS3 ARE BEING USED AS DECORATIVE PIECES OF MY ROOM. 

$$;
Pros:. Streams movies/music from my PC, blu-ray movies look awesome, MGS4 is cool (the only game I have).. 
Cons:. only had it 1 month (+ 1 week so I can't return it) and it's fried. Won't play games or blue-ray discs.. 
Summary:. Great product, when it works.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wireless Everything, Blu-ray. 
Cons:. Bad Network (PSN), Slow, Account System, A Lot More. 
Summary:. I was so excited to get it, but I returned it after only 3 days after coming across so many things I didn't like. First, the PSN (Playstation Network) was terrible. I hated how you make a user name and then it is permenant and you CANNOT change it. They should have at least emphasized more that you need to pick one that you like, and not just make one quick to try out the online play. Second, the account system was no good. I hated how each account could only use THAT accounts save games, music, etc. This became an issue when I wanted to make a new PSN user name and I had to delete my account and make a new one, which also ended up erasing my save games and everything else. Another issue was simply the speed of the system. Hours of updates (5 hours for MGS4), game installations, and just the speed of everything else. When trying to select music or simply navigate through the music, it would freeze up and load and **** me off. Also, I hated that it was limited to only mp3 format songs. I tried to put my iTunes library on it, and ended up only getting half the songs because all the .aac format songs and all other formats were skipped. Plus, it was VERY complicated even finding the mp3's on my portable hard drive and it took FOREVER to copy them to the system. OH OH OH AND DON'T FORGET the ps3 is not yet capable of playing your music during gameplay. This was the last straw in my ownership of the system, and I took it back the day I realized this on top of all the other issues I had.. If I had any suggestions to make, I would say wait on getting the system. Let Sony at least try to work out all the issues that currently exist on the ps3. It had the potential to be a good system, but they released it with way too many problems at a much too high price. The decision is yours, but all I know is I used to be a die-hard fan of the Sony Playstation over all other consoles, and now I am seriously considering an Xbox.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good single player and for hobbyists. 
Cons:. Voice delay, Bluetooth. 
Summary:. First, PS3 is great for games and players who don't care about online play. The interface for this is great and very smooth. Styling of interface is very impressive. The systems flexibility to becoming a computer is pretty cool for hobbyists or even serious programming.. Here are a few suggestions to developers that could help complete PS3 for me as an online gamer.. - Fix Bluetooth headset delay or manufacture an accessory that user another connection type. Hard to play games when playing as a team. Hope this works better later as it is a great idea.. - Needs IR...there are some many remotes out there that are universal and having multiple remotes is just cumbersome. Although, the game pad is quit smooth in surfing around the menus.. - Needs vibration in controller. At least, I've seen it as an option for game play. (I have PS3, 80gb). - My hands hurt because these controllers are so tiny. Make some for American hands. We are a big people...some of use are 6' 4" and do not have child like digits.. - In game music. People might like other music....I don't know, evangelical gospel while capping aliens.. - Need access to main menu while in game. Sony...we could be buying something while waiting for a next game round...... - Ability to chat with friends and not need to sign out to play a game.. - Would like to see what other games people have on my friends list. Be cool if players could see other players stats and reputations.. Anyhow, hope the developers get suggestions in their in boxes.. 

$$;
Pros:. Customer Service telephone wait times only 11 min.. 
Cons:. Their "No Refund Policy" is very rigid. No exceptions.. 
Summary:. Just hope you don't have to call customer service for any reason after you make a purchase. Sony requires you as a customer to be perfect, no room for simple human error.. We purchased a game from their online store to download into the console, but it didn't seem to work. So we switched cards and tried a second time, which was succussful. Turnes out the first transaction went through, but we thought no big deal, we'll just call customer service to refund the mistake. They replied "no refunds". Talked to a superviser, "no refunds". I asked if anyone at Sony had the power to refund a transaction and she said "no". Wow, not even the president of Sony has the power or athority to make a $20 refund.. Playstations no refund policy is so rigid they said they are willing to lose my family as a cutomer than rufund a simple mistake. No joke, I really asked the supervier if she was willing to lose us.. So be it.. 

$$;
Pros:. While it worked, it was great--excellent image quality, good loading time.. 
Cons:. It stopped reading discs. The system cost $500 when we bought it, not to mention the hundreds of dollars we spent on games. Now it's a paperweight, and Sony wants us to pay $150 for them just to look at it.. 
Summary:. The system has no poor durability and Sony has terrible customer service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good image quality when it was working.. 
Cons:. After 11months my PS3 bought in Dec.2007 at Future shop in Montreal stopped working.Could not play any DVD's at all. $400.00 down the drain.. 
Summary:. I will never buy a SONY product again!. I called customer service for my PS3 problem and they told me that I would have to pay $169.00 plus tax to have it fixed or replaced by a refurbished unit.. I told them that it was only 13 months old but Sony just don't Care. Hey I'm glad my LCD TV is a SHARP!.. You would think that one month pass the warranty period that Sony would help but they just don't care. Maybe that's why they now have financial problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slick looking. 
Cons:. To little games, Bad Frame rates.. 
Summary:. This is not worth anyones time it has bad hardware issues and so little games, no gamer can have fun.. 

$$;
Pros:. None unless you want to throw your money away.. 
Cons:. Purchsed 11/2008 broke (Blu-Ray Drive) 07/2009.Waste of money, don't waste your time. I will not buy any Sony products in the future since they are not reliable.. 
Summary:. System broke, Sony does not stand behind it's product....Worst purchase I've ever made.0 stars..... 

$$;
Pros:. For the blu-ray.. 
Cons:. I thought I would get a great multimedia reader but I cannot read my European DVD (and there's no way to remove the protection). Netflix is missing. The Sony store is really slow and expensive. Today, I would buy a Xbox360 without any doubt.. 
Summary:. If you don't play and just want to use your PS3 as a Blu-Ray reader, buy something else.. 

$$;
Pros:. None, I wish I bought a different product from a quality company. 
Cons:. Poor reliability. 
Summary:. Bluray player stopped working after 3 months of light use. I started the warranty claim 4 weeks ago and I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with Sony and they still cannot tell me when the PS3 will be returned to me. I regret buying a Sony product. I have had similar problems in the past with Sony portable electronics and Sony home audio.. 

$$;
Pros:. I really dont know of any pros. 
Cons:. 2 of the ones i got broke right out of the box. 
Summary:. never by this system unless you like to waste money. 

$$;
Pros:. GREAT SYSTEM ALL AROUNG WHEN IT?S WORKING.. 
Cons:. -VERY VERY VERY UNRELIABLE SYSTEM.. -ONLY 1 YEAR WARRENTY.. -VERY POOR CUSTOMER SEVICE.. 
Summary:. -PLEASE DON?T THINK I?M JUST BEING NASTY BECAUSE I DIDN?T GET WHAT I WANTED READ THIS REVIEW AND THEN GO TO OTHER FOURMS AND READ WHAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND OF OTHER PS3 OWNERS HAVE TO SAY.. -TO START YES THIS SYSTEM WAS GREAT IN ALL ASPECTS OF WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO AND WE LOVED IT AS WE LOVED THE VERY FIRST ONE TO COME OUT AND ALL INBETWEEN. UNFORTUNATELY UNLIKE THE OTHERS THE PS3 HAS VERY SERIUOS FLAWS. WE HAVE THE 2007 60GB MODEL OF THE PS3 AND TREAT IT LIKE GOLD KEPT IT DUSTED CLEANED THE LASERS WITH PS3 APPROVED DISK CLEANER AND FOLLOWED THEIR INSTRUCTIONS TO THE T AND EVEN BOUGHT THE EXTURNAL FAN FOR ADDED PROTECTION , PAID JUST UNDER $600.00 FOR IT SO WHY WOULDN?T WE. AFTER ONLY 1 YEAR AND 1 MONTH THE PS3 STOPPED READING ALL DISKS IT WON?T EVEN RUN THE DISK CLEANER. THIS WHEN I STARTED SEARCHING THE NET TO FIND A SOLUTION AND SO FAR I HAVEN?T FOUND ONE AND I HAVE BEEN READING AND SEARCHING FOR DAYS. I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS AN EXTREAMLY COMMON PROBLEM AND THAT THE ONLY THING SONY WILL DO IF YOU ARE PAST THE WARRENTY OR IF YOU HAVE LOST YOUR RECEIPT IS SEND YOU A BOX TO RETURN THE SYSTEM TO THEM AND THEY WILL BE HAPPY TO FIX YOURS OR SEND YOU A REFURBISHED ONE AND IN EITHER CASE A BILL OF $177.45 FOR THEIR TROUBLE. I ASKED THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGENT IF THIS SEEMED RIGHT THAT I SHOULD PAY ABOUT $600.00 FOR THE SYSTEM AND AFTER ONLY 1 + YEAR I SHOULD THEN HAVE TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL $177.45 TO CONTINUE USING MY SYSTEM AND WHATS STOPPING THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN SOON OR LATER. SHE REPLIED ?WELL SIR WE DO OFFER A ONE YEAR WARRENTY AND THAT THESE TYPE OF THING WILL HAPPEN WITH ALL ELECTRONICS AND THAT YOU CAN EXPECT THEM TO KEEP WORKING FOR EVER, BUT IF YOU DO WANT US TO FIX YOUR SYSTEM WE HAVE A 90 DAY WARRENTY THAT COMES WITH THE FIXED OT REFURBISHED SYSTEM?. I THEN SAID WELL THEN I SHOULD BE SAY FOR ANOTHER 3 MONTHS THEN BUT WHATS STOPPING ME FROM HAVING TO DO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN IN 4 OR HOPEFULLY MORE MONTHS AND THAT IF YOU CHECK OUT THE FOURMS OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO YOU WOULD SEE THAT THIS IS A REOCCURING PROBLEM AND IT WILL MOST LIKELY HAPPEN AGAIN WITH IN 1 OR 2 YEARS AT BEST. SHE THEN REPLIED ?WELL SIR WE CAN?T GARUANTEE IT WON?T BUT I WOULD DOUBT THAT IT WILL?.. -SO I?M SORRY TO RIGHT A NOVEL BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT I THINK IS CRIMINAL AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT WILL PROBABLY BE IN THEIR FUTURE IF THEY BUY A PS3. I TURLY WISH I WOULD HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS SYSTEM. XBOX HAS SOME SIMULAR PROBLEMS BUT GIVE MUCH BETTER SERVICE AND IN MOST CASES REPALCE SYSTEM FOR FREE. I WON?T BE FIXING THIS SYSTEM AND MY MANY YEARS ON DEADICATION TO SONY PRODUCTS ESPECIALY THE PLAY STATIONS IS NOW OVER AND WITH THE RECENT BAD ECONOMY AND SONY LAYING 5000+ EMPLOYEES OFF I WOULD SAY EVERY LOST CUSTOMER COUNTS.. I HOPE THIS HAS HELPED AND PLEASE DON?T JUST TAKE MY WORDS FOR IT DO SOME RESEARCH FOR YOUR SELF.. 

$$;
Pros:. There are non Pros to the PS3 80GB. 
Cons:. Too many to cover using 250 characters. See bottom-line summary below.. 
Summary:. Sony is incredibly cheap with this one. I purchased a bundled package (available in japan), with two controllers and my planet. To my surprise, only one cord was provided for a single controller; rendering the second bonus controller... worthless. Further, no cord for HDMI output which you figure would be included standard considering you are still paying more than 400 bucks for the 'so called' discounted system , not to mention the games are designed for high def play. Analog output is miserable. Load time is long considering the system's core power. Only two usb ports (for the freaking controllers! ). I have been faithful to Sony for years, but the disappointment of the PS3 has really put me over the top. I think many Japanese consumers share my sentiments, as well, as there has been a recent shift to the Xbox 360. The Xbox failed miserably in Japan, but the 360 sure is doing very well as of late. With Japanese consumers turning their back on the PS3, it is certainly doomed for imminent failure. For your own sake, please,please stay away from the PS3..
