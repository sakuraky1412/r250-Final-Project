Pros:. Amazing TV! Color, Contrast, Picture, future proof - HDMI 1.4a, 3D, widgets, Picture control, and most importantly Design. 
Cons:. Slight blur when object moving too fast, not as energy efficient as LCD. 
Summary:. I used to own a UN55B8000 LED TV - I like the picture more on this TV. The TV I got is really the PN58C7000 or the 58" version for under $1800. You cannot beat that price for the quality and the TV is only 1.5" thick!!!! 3D is great my buddy has the UN55C7000 and it is not as good. It is currently hooked up to my new Pioneer VSX-33 Elite so it sounds amazing. I would also recommond if you go this route that you get the Blueray player BDP6900.. Just saw Prince of Persia and the color was amazing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is exceeds my expectations. Internet and Wi-Fi capability. Samsung Apps are good and free at this point. Very low price for a 3d TV. 
Cons:. Like all plasma's, must be careful of burn in during 1st 100 hours. It is heavy to move around, my 50" requires 2 people. 
Summary:. I am not a tech guy, but I do like to have the latest technology. This TV offered me great picture quality, 3D, and Samsung apps at a far lower price than other TVs. Also, this TV is very thin! I get compliments on it, every-time someone comes over to my place.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent HD picture, remote, excellent 2D to 3 D conversion, excellent 2D picture, good online services including Netflix, ability to change it to a C8000 in service menu to add Dejudder control and more custom settings, thin, ghosting rare in 3D. 
Cons:. notice occasional flicker in 2d to 3d conversion, but have not seen anyone else complain about it, so it is probably my 3D glasses. 
Summary:. Consumer reports and CNET rate it as a close equal to the Panasonic. I really enjoy the occasional movie or tv show converted from 2D to 3D, especially if there are outdoor scenes. I have not used it to watch 3D content yet, because there is so little.. I had the Samsung 2009 plasma B650 and it is better than that in every way. All those issues that other reviewers notice, I haven't noticed. I have seen Blue Ray Hurt Locker and didn't notice any issues like one reviewer said. another reviewer mentioned 4:3 pulldown issues and I have not seen any problem with that either. I use it with Direct TV dvr, Apple TV and the Samsung BD-P3600 blue ray player.. I usually watch it in Movie mode or Relax mode and it looks great.. 

$$;
Pros:. See summary below.. 
Cons:. None!!!!!!. 
Summary:. I've used this TV for almost three months. There are no cons that I can honestly mention. Picture quality in all dimensions is superb - with plenty calibration choices. It's silent , it's fast (using menu options and accessing the internet apps) and the display only gets warm but not hot (as other plasmas). it's a beautiful TV - elegantly slim - on and off. It handles glare very well. With all its features - which get frequently updated through its internet connection - and fantastic picture quality, it can hardly be better. Ok, maybe adding a skype app in the near future. My guests are repeatedly impressed, every time they come over. A great value. Simply Wow!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great anti glare coating. Really sharp picture. Many picture modes.. 
Cons:. You MUST turn off the dejudder (read below for how to). The sound is barely adequate. No buzzing or ghosting as others have reported. 
Summary:. Great value, I bought mine online, although the first two in a row arrived with cracked screens so be cautious on accepting any delivery without actually opening the box prior to signing. Third TV came just fine. It was probably the shipping company.. The picture sharpness is like no other plasma. I have a very high end Pioneer and the Samsung definitely has better image processing from the same source. With that being said, the colors are not as strong as the Pioneer, however, I believe with proper image adjustment I should be able to get it close.. As I mentioned the "soap opera effect", which I would more accurately describe as it looks like your at the filming of the show (you would think that is good, but its not), the acting is painfully less dramatic. This you can turn off, however it is not obvious how (You MUST turn off the dejudder (done by turning game mode off, on, then off again....or by doing the hack ). The "soap opera effect" actually works really good when watching football, so I would recommend updatding the C8000 software so you can turn the effect back on. In doing the game mode on/off/on technique there is no way to turn dejudder back on for sports. Video games look really cool with dejudder turned on however it adds the slight delay in processing time that makes in impractical for live gaming (you'll be shot dead before you even see the guy on your screen). Football and Planet Earth type shows look great with dejudder on, but not TV shows or movies with any acting.. The netflix app is sub par to the xbox version of the netflix app, however if I didn't already have xbox, it could be watchable. The problem occurs when your internet changes speed and the picture stops to re-adjust resolution. This happens where I live probably every 10 minutes, the xbox handles it almost seamlessly, while the Samsung takes about three times as long.. All in all a great TV, I recently changed over to the C8000 software so I am still figuring out the image processing and CALDAY/CALNIGHT settings. Once I have the colors set up properly this will be great (with the exception of the sound). 

$$;
Pros:. Video processing, very good color, excellent for viewing sporting events. 
Cons:. TV stand seems a bit wobbly at times. 
Summary:. Ok, so like most of you, I spent a good deal of time doing research for my TV purchase. Ultimately, it came down to two TV's: the Panasonic TC-PVT20 and the Samsung PN50C7000. After much debate and based on everything I had read and seen in-store, I initially decided to go with the Panasonic TC-PVT20 from Best Buy. The TV looked beautiful in-store, got great recommendations from both CNET and Consumer Reports, and seemed like an all-around no-brainer to buy.. However, once I got it home and hooked up to my DIRECTV box, I was pretty surprised at how disappointed I was. I was SHOCKED at how poor the motion-handling capability was on the Panasonic. As I jumped between MLB HD, NHL HD, NFL Network HD, NBA HD, and ESPN HD, I couldn't believe how much trouble I was having viewing the various sporting events. Anytime there was a panning motion from side-to-side (and let's face it, that's pretty much all that happens during a game) it seemed like someone was shaking the camera. It was very jarring and really difficult to ignore. In fact, it was even difficult to watch normal TV shows when an image moved horizontally across the screen, let alone sporting events.. In addition, the picture in STANDARD mode was nothing special (not even as good as my parents' Panasonic G10 from last year), though switching to THX mode did result in a significant improvement. And, to be fair, still images looked excellent on the Panasonic.. However, it was impossible to ignore the motion blurring issue, so I returned the Panasonic and got the Samsung PN50C7000 - and I couldn't be happier. Once you perform either the firmware update or the "switch to Game Mode and back" maneuver, any hint of a video processing issue (a.k.a. "soap opera affect") is gone. The Samsung correctly handles panning motion while viewing sporting events and, quite honestly, has delivered the best Blu-Ray movie picture I've ever seen (a few friends stopped by to watch Iron Man 2 and commented that they couldn't believe how crisp the picture looked).. So, all-in-all, while the Panasonic TV was not bad, it didn't deliever the viewing experience I believed I was going to receive. The Samsung has far exceeded my expectations and didn't cost nearly as much as the Panasonic. It's a close battle between the two but, if you like watching sports, I'd definitely recommend the Samsung PN50C7000 (PN50C8000, for that matter).. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen and image quality is amazing. Out of all the TVs i looked at in the 46-52 inch range, this was by far the best for the price. For a plasma, the screen is very thin, which is nice because a lot of people are fooled when they see it.. 
Cons:. The screen at first can be a little dark, but with some (THX) calibration, this is easily fixed. It'd be nice if the internet apps would allow you to watch the TV while using the apps, like a PIP. The one component input also is a negative in my book. 
Summary:. Overall, this is very nice screen. The Blu ray images are stunning to look at, and even eerie sometimes how they just pop out of the screen (without the 3D). The internet content (having used previous Samsung TVs with InfoLink internet content) is a major improvement from previous versions offering a wide variety of free and paid apps for all tastes.. The size and weight of the screen are very nice. Having mounted the TV on a wall and it being so thin were a nice welcome from my previous TV. Plugging and unplugging the inputs were very accessible given the thinness of the screen. A lot of people that have looked at the screen without knowing that it's a plasma offer comments like "oh, you went with an LCD....NICE!" only to find out that in fact it's a plasma, which is an easy way of figuring out who knows about TVs, and who claim to know about TVs.. A very (very) minor negative is that the PIP while viewing the internet apps is only available at the app selection menu, after you select an app, the tv images and sound go away, which in my opinion, would be better served if the apps (or the TV itself) could incorporate the option of viewing and hearing tv images.. The single component input is a downer, but i (and many other people i suspect) can live with it. HDMI at this point is pretty ubiquitous, and quite frankly if you're short on component inputs having purchased (or looked at) a TV like this, it probably means your devices are in need of an update.. All in all, if you're in the market for a thin, light, content rich plasma tv out of the box, this one will require a 'once over' review.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Picture quality is absolutely stunning. Unmatched black levels. 2. 3D technology, including 2D to 3D conversion(AMAZING). 3. Screen burn protection. 4. Ability to completely customize picture options.. 
Cons:. 1. Take this with a grain of salt. Soap opera effect is annoying but EASILY FIXABLE. Dont let this be a deal breaker for you(explained below). 2. Cannot handle 1080/24fps sources, despite some advertising gimmics.. 3. Does not include 3D glasses. 
Summary:. I recently purchased this TV to upgrade my 46 in Samsung LED TV and it honestly has the best picture quality I have ever seen on an HDTV. This will be my fourth HDTV in the last 6 years so I am no stranger to the topic. My 46in LED was purchased last year, but after several months I was left unimpressed and decided to jump into the market for a new one. My first HDTV was a 42in Dynex plasma TV(which I still think has a better picture than the Samsung LED!!) and after briefly switching to the LCD/LED market I decided to go back to plasma. Best decision I ever made.. First off I would like to address the "Soap opera effect" found on this TV. When you buy the TV is comes set with the motion judder technology normally found on LED/LCD tvs. This can be a massive annoyance to people as it causes some sources to look "fake" with ghosting effects. Several people have returned their sets because of this, so I wanted to clarify that this is an easily fixed issue and certainly not a deal breaker for anyone considering this tv. You can turn off this effect by accessing general settings under Plug N Play, then selecting game mode. Turn game mode on then off and viola! your TV functions normally. Samsung has also offered a firmware update to fix the issue, but I found it unnecessary as switching the game mode permanently fixes the issue. Still, its good to know more options are available.. As far as performance goes, this TV is certainly among the elite. It has a stunning color contrast with immensely deep blacks. Watching star trek on BD was quite an experience, delivering stunning blacks, especially is the space scenes. The 3D is also amazing, and with the option to convert 2D sources to 3D the fun literally never ends. I didnt buy this TV for the 3D, but its certainly an awesome feature to have. Lastly, for all you skeptics out there that bash plasma for its pixel burn in effect, worry no more. Samsung included an amazing prevention system on this set that prevents burn in, but also erases it using an on screen moving display. Burn in is now an issue of the past.. In terms of cons, there aren't many issues I have but definitely a few worth addressing. First off, this TV cannot handle 1080/24fps sources despite some sites indicating that it can. This is a minor issue to me as i've never really been able to tell the difference, but to some it may be a problem. Either way, for a TV of this price I would have thought Samsung would have included this feature. Unfortunately not. Also, for those looking for an out of box 3D experience, this set does not include the glasses. I would have liked Samsung to include these, but oh well.. Overall, this is an excellent TV with a very reasonable price tag. It gives you state of the art technology and amazing picture quality for much less than its LED/LCD counterparts. I've always been a bigger fan of plasma, and this TV certainly solidifies that notion. Good job Samsung.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture is totally customizable which makes me feel like i have total control of Picture Calibration, etc. I thought i would be annoyed by this but after playing with some of the options, i like it a lot.. 
Cons:. I am extremely disappointed with Samsung for selling a product that wasn't completely ready for consumers and not letting their customers who have purhased this TV know about the fix. It's seems like it's all about the money nowadays.. 
Summary:. I almost took this TV back because the "Ghosting/Motion Blur" and 'Soap Opera' issues were driving me crazy. I said to myself, "Self, surely this can't be the same TV that David from CNET gave good reviews to. NO WAY" I read several forums that suggested i toggle on and off the Game Mode and this helped on all HDMI inputs but guess what, there is no game mode for the TV Coax Source Input which is what i primarily would be using for watching TV. I was so annoyed that i literally started getting the box prepped to take it back to Conns. I did one last search on CNET and found that David had sent an email to Samsung concerning this issue and learned of an upgrade that was only available on the samsung support site for this TV. You basically have to download the upgrade and install it on your TV via usb. Thank You David for doing the legwork. I went from having a tv that i regretted purchasing to getting exactly what i expected and paid for. Since the upgrade, i've had no further issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent black-level performance; accurate color overall; solid 3D picture quality; Glare is not an issue which helps bring you into the picture, not just like you're watching TV or looking through a window.. 
Cons:. hot and does not save that much energy low audio. 
Summary:. awesome device great standard video and great 3d movie effects and great solid design lacks better audio and well it does not make save on your light bill and its hot. 

$$;
Pros:. Setup was a snap, features great, picture even better, and the price was awesome.. 
Cons:. Not thrilled with the audio but I can use what I saved to buy an audio system.. 
Summary:. Buy it. Got mine at BB with a 3D starter kit, bluray bundle, and wireless dongle for under $1,600. 

$$;
Pros:. GREAT PICTURE QUALITY , CHEAP. 
Cons:. NONE AFTER DOING UPDATE. 
Summary:. OK , IF YOU WERE WONDERING ABOUT THOSE NASTY REVIEWS FROM OTHER CONSUMERS, I MUST TELL YOU THAT THEY WERE RIGHT , TILL NOW. NO MORE GHOSTING ISSUE OR SOAP OPERA PROBLEMS ANYMORE. SAMSUNG RELEASED ON 09/02/2010 A FIRMWARE UPDATE THAT WILL GET RID OF THAT PROBLEM AND DISABLE THE SOAP OPERA EFFECT THE TV WAS HAVING .. NOW I ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE THAT MEGA SMOOTH OPTION AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO TURN IT BACK ON UNTIL NOW. AFTER HOURS SEARCHING I WAS ABLE TO UPDATE MY SERVICE MENU TO THE NEW 8000 SERIES WHICH GIVES YOU THE OPTION OF DOING THIS CALIBRATION. IF YOU WANT TO SPENT AN ADDITIONAL $400 FOR THIS MENU OPTION BE MY GUEST OR YOU CAN BUY THIS TV FOR MUCH LESS AND APPLY THE 8000 SERIES CALIBRATION OPTION BY FOLLOWING THIS SIMPLE STEPS.. Instructions:. - Turn off tv. - Press Mute-1-8-2-Power in sequence. - Once the tv is on, the service menu should appear at the top left corner.. - Go to options. - Change the model to c8000. - Press reset to factory default to exit out of the menu.. - Tv will turn off and back on, once is back on, a massage should appear saying, board has been change, don't worry, just click ok and everything should be fine.. - To get rid of the message, just go back into the service menu and change the front color to T-C-Black. You will notice that now under picture options- film mode- you will have a cinema smooth option. Also you will have a motion judder canceler option.. And last you will have two new presets, cal-day and cal-night. HOPE THIS HELPS YOU OUT . I WAS AMAZED WITH THIS NEW MENU OPTION AND I CANT REALLY COMPLAIN ABOUT MY PURCHASE .. 

$$;
Pros:. After some struggles the picture and 3D are what I expected when purchased.. 
Cons:. Apparently EVERY unit is coming out of the factory in game mode even though the on screen guide says it is OFF.. 
Summary:. None of these TV's should be sold without a warning of this serious bug, but there is a very easy work around. I was at my wits end and nearly ready to take it back... then I came across a few other reports of this game mode issue. Since I am not a "gamer" I would have never stumbled upon the fix.. Using the menu button--&gt;Plug&#38;Play--&gt;general--&gt;game mode you must turn this mode ON, then OFF and wallllaaa you can finally use the TV . This process must be repeated for each and every source (at least the HDMI anyway). I did this with the sources on but that may not be necessary. 

$$;
Pros:. Great deep color. Amazing picture detail.. 
Cons:. When I first got this TV the ghosting WAS TERRIBLE. I think this is a TV defect (see Summary). As far as I can tell TV only puts out 2 channel stereo (even using a digital optical cable). Makes you not even want to use the streaming movie feature.. 
Summary:. If there's a way to output 5.1 stereo directly from the TV, I can't figure it out.. The TV had MAJOR ghosting issues. I went through Samsung customer service to try to fix it and nothing worked. 2 days prior to my service appointment, the ghosting stopped completely (I hope it doesn't come back). The only thing I did to the TV prior to the ghosting stopping was turning on then off the game mode. I don't know if this was the fix, but I haven't had an issue since. Hopefully Samsung figures it out soon and offers a fix.. I think the ghosting image is a problem this model TV; not just mine. I read of many people having the same issue. If it couldn't be fixed, I'd still be having the problem. Ironic that CNET did not have the same issue during the testing.. Updated. on Jul 15, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture from what I've seen at stores, much thinner than the current Panny 3D plasmas - and hopefully no rising black levels!. 
Cons:. Whats up with the lack of 1080p/24 abilities?. 
Summary:. Hey Dave, Any idea when you guys are going to get your hands on the higher end PNC8000 plasma series for a full review?? Can't wait.. 

$$;
Pros:. Mostly gorgeous BluRay images. 3D compatible. Plenty bright. Solid colors with good accuracy. A lot of picture adjustments available. Ability to set picture settings specific to inputs. Easy to navigate menus.. 
Cons:. Dynamic contrast makes dark scenes flicker, Source select function not compatible with macros, 4:3 stretch not automatic, grey levels in darkest scenes difficult to impact via picture settings. Cost a tad high. Menu didn't explain anything.. 
Summary:. Buzz ? This unit does have a buzz but it took me a long time before I noticed. Honestly, my DVR cable box?s hard drive and fan are louder even when in a cabinet. I can not hear the buzz from my normal seating distance of 10? even with all sound mutedUnless you watch a lot of TV with the sound completely off, I?d be surprised you would notice. Front panel button ? These are all but impossible to see in low light and generally don?t work well when you can see them,. Source select ? You?re forced to scroll sequentially through your options or use multiple direction and enter keys to select something. I?d like to set macros on my remotes but this arrangement makes it impossible.. Picture mode - The unit will not automatically switch between 4:3 stretched to full 16:9 pictures. If stretch mode is on, the 4:3 is set correct but 16:9 is also stretched; HD no good. If stretch is off, you get black bars for 4:3 and now 16:9 looks correct; burn in no good. I switch between SD and HD when watching cable (all output via HMDI). Luckily the remote has a picture size key to make changing the setting easier but I really feel this is a day to day nuisance that will never go away. So much for smart electronics.. 3D ? This didn?t function did not work until I hit ?Picture Correction? in the 3D menus. For me, the feature is largely a gimmick. The picture size needs to be about 3 times as large to really get the effect I see at IMAX. Maybe that?s an unfair comparison but I can honestly say I have no desire to watch 3D on this 50? set. It feels like you?re looking out of a window on the other side of the room. When I look out of a window, I want to be right in front of it but doing this on the TV would be bad on the eyes. For still images, the effect is very realistic and well received by my eyes. Moving pictures seems to have trouble. I see multiple images all at once and it?s distracting like motion judder on fast panning film material. Bottom line, I wouldn?t pay for this feature unless it were at least on a 100? screen.. Dynamic contrast ? This function seems amazingly flawed when viewed with very low light scenes. I watched 2 movies and noticed in each that with very low light levels, the dynamic contrast would shift the background black levels in unit steps to different levels. Almost like a loose wire in a bad analog connection, the contrast level just jumps and flickers. To see, get a BluRay copy of ?The Hurt Locker? and start watching at 1:43:00 (scene 15). The picture goes almost completely black for 3 seconds during which the screen flickers between different black levels. If you have either BDLive or Standard mode on, no other adjustments will make this go away. They apparently override the dynamic contrast and set it to high. If I set the TV to Movie mode and turn dynamic contrast to lo or off, the affect went away. This makes both of these setting useless which is unfortunate because they were the two that I felt looked the best.. Black levels - Black levels with good source materials (BluRay) and a bright image produce a spectacular picture with plenty of ?pop?. However, I believe most sets excel at this type of material. In the darkest scenes such at the one in ?The Hurt Locker? I could find no way to affect the low level grey I was seeing. This did not seem to impact the ?pop? of normal images and really didn?t detract too much from the viewing experience. If I could verify another TV can handle this a bit better, I will probably return the unit since this is one of the more important features to me. Admittedly I?m a bit picky here. I?m guessing 90% or more of the population would find the image to be exceptional and for all but the darkest scenes, I would have to agree. Even with dark scenes, the image is pretty good. SD material doesn?t look very good on the set but again, I doubt many fixed pixel displays can really excel here due to their very nature and large screen sizes. Magnify anything enough and it will look bad.. Color ? I though color accuracy was no issue and generally looked excellent. There?s a tremendous amount of controls here including 10 point white balance adjustments. However, I have been struggling with the amount of color but it?s likely no fault of the TV. Some cable channels look way too saturated and others much too grey. I think this is a case of garbage in ? garbage out. What I don?t see are the grey color issues stated by the other user; not to say they don?t exist.. Sounds like a lot of negatives but honestly I think most people will find this set very enjoyable and be highly satisfied. I?m disappointed with the dynamic contrast function, source selection method, and inability to affect grey in the darkest scenes. Due to these reasons, I?ve left 3 stars. I may actually return the unit but I don?t have a clear better option to go with other than last year?s Samsungs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture but not everything comes out like it should.. 
Cons:. Blacks is blacker and means better? Sorry editor, but I stopped believing this spec alone is what makes a tv picture look more real.. 
Summary:. I tried to compare the LG model to this and was hard pressed to come out with any real differences after many adjustments made. Not even the salesman could tell in the end. There was also the Panasonic costing nearly the same and on most viewings, we could not tell any differences. Overall, I would take the most pleasant looking tv and cheapest if possible because the screen on many tv's today are build oem in Korea and exported.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very nice looking set. Picture quality for slow moving stuff is nice.. 
Cons:. Features do not live up to billing.. Ghosting on fast moving HD images.. 
Summary:. The Samsung q and a site used to say this TV was skype capable. I even chatted with tech support and they confirmed that it was indeed skype capable. Turns out, it is only the LED tvs that are. Now I'm stuck with a useless $150 camera. Also, I have found that the codecs that are supposedly supported in the Media Play feature do not work properly. If you just want a TV, this is a good option, but please be very careful if you are buying it for features. I've found Samsung is very deceptive about the feature set.. I am hoping that they provide a firmware update, rather than alienate a customer base. If they do, I will update my review.. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally a 3D Plasma. Looks...good? Price.. 
Cons:. gray, gray, gray. Everything looks gray even after fiddling with the settings for over an hour. Contrast, brightness, color, etc etc etc.. 
Summary:. This is one of the few times I will say a LED looks better than a Plasma. It's a good TV bot price and styling, but for some reason the color has super strong gray overtones. I have messed with the setting for over an hour watching Bolt as a demo for customers (I work at a retail store) and I just can't really get it to look good. We have it next to the PN50B850 and the B850 is leaps and bounds better. So far having see the UN55B8000 &#38; UN55C7000 for the top offerings in the LED department (top of the line LED's we currently have at the time of this review) the B850 is still the best. If you are looking for a 3D TV in the Samsung 7000 series I would recommend the LED C7000. However if the gray overtones don't bother you I don't think the $1K price difference is worth it to get the LED.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's best picture is awesome. Great depth and color to the picture. Glare is not an issue which helps bring you into the picture, not just like you're watching TV or looking through a window.. 
Cons:. The dot crawl (or motion blur) is significant, especially on older film. Worked with Samsung tech support, which was good, but provided no help. Returned it for Panasonic plasma, which didn't have any issues with dot crawl.. 
Summary:. Was extremely excited when I brought this TV home as its best picture is phenomenal. But after several hours of watching, I started to notice this motion blur around the some of the edges of slower moving objects. The blur would typically show up on either the edge of a darker object with lighter background or on lighter object in darker background. Also, this blur was very noticeable on older films where the video wasn't recorded with as high of resolution as today's films. But was still noticible even on new blu-ray DVD's. Also, problem existed for both DVD and Directv. Bought a high end Monster HDMI cable per Samsung's recommendation, but that didn't fix it at all either.. First worked with Samsung online tech support. Had me adjust a few settings but nothing improved it. They referred me to their Tier 2 techs who hooked me up with a local service tech. They provided no help at all.. Next I took the same DVD into the retail store, had a few of the sales staff watch the DVD with me to see if I could duplicate the problem. I could. We then moved to the Samsung Series 8000 plasma, again same problem. We then moved to the Samsung LED Series 8000. Again, same problem. By now I'm convinced that all new TV's are going to pose this problem.. We then went to another recommended plasma TV, Panasonic and by now was nervous that every TV was going to produce this motion blur (explained to me as called dot crawl). However, the Panasonic plasma didn't do it at all. So have since brought home the Panasonic plasma and have yet to notice any of this dot crawl.. All in all, quite disappointing in the TV. The picture quality when not blurring is unbelievable, but that motion blur is not good and is persistent once you notice it. And because we could reproduce this at the store with all of their top end Samsung's, I'm convinced that it's a manufacturer's technology that is root of the problem. If Samsung could get this fixed, they would have one spectacular TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality (for the first 4 hours). 
Cons:. Never have I had such a horrible experience with a brand-new, +$1,000 product. My TV broke within 4 hours of being taken out of box.. 
Summary:. Has been over 3 weeks and I still have a broken tv sitting in my living room. Apparently replacement parts are hard to come by. Would have been waiting on the part forever had I not taken the initiative to contact Samsung customer service (after having already spoken to them and had a repair guy come to my house only to not have the right par) to inquire about the availability of the part. I was told the part was on "permanent backorder" with no deliverable timeframe. The only positive to the whole situation is that Samsung offered to replace the TV with a brand new unit. Yet again, however, I am left frustrated and disappointed with Samsung as I have since been informed that this model is not "in stock in [their] warehouse", to which I was told that I would allowed to choose from a selection of TV's of greater value. Currently awaiting a call from the "warehouse" to confirm which models they will be offering. All things considered, I am very dissappointed with Samsung as despite their customer service department's best efforts to rectify the situation, they just cant seem to overcome their supply chain issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. Thin. Nice web interface. 
Cons:. Soap opera effect. Adjusting does not help. Judder on DVD and blue ray. A blur around people is common in moving scenes. I expect a call from Samsung to replace with a quality product. I bet the call never comes..... 
Summary:. Avoid. Big mistake on my part to purchase..
