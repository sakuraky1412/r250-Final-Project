i 've wanted to stay at the mayflower for years , and i was a bit disappointed by its execution .
to begin , the room was nice enough , a bit on the smaller side and no bathtub ( although the shower is spacious , i must say ) .
the window was small , which meant very little natural light .
the bed was comfortable enough , and there was a small couch which was directly in front of the tv , so it was n't all that convenient to sit there and chill out while watching tv .
i was particularly disappointed by the fact that the business center did n't have free computer and printer access .
it 's run by ups ( which was helpful , because i had a package to send out !
) , but i just stayed at a 3 star hotel down the road with free computer and printer access , so that was a bit weird .
they also do n't have tea/coffee in the room , they give you a voucher to go to the restaurant to use , but that 's not very handy when you want a drink without having to get dressed and go downstairs .
i did n't eat in the restaurant , so i ca n't speak for it .
i found myself having to struggle to get my luggage out , even though there are doormen , which was disappointing as well .
the location is killer though , dead center downtown .
the glory of this hotel seems to be behind it , i 'm coming back to dc in september and . . .
