the hotel is right next to the antarctic centre , which although a little pricey is worth the visit as long as you have 2-3 hours to get your monies worth ( do n't go after 4pm , see trip advisor reviews ) and even better if you go at 9am and then use the free antarctic centre bus at 11:30 or 12:30 to go in to the city for the afternoon.
the hotel is right next to a shopping complex with large countdown supermarket ( woolworths in australia ) and there are a number of fast food , cafe and small restaurant options so you do n't need to eat in the hotel if you do n't feel like paying hotel restaurant food prices .

the positive for those with a car or hire car at end of trip is that parking is free and it is pretty easy to use the car around christchurch and then drop off your hire car and walk back to hotel .

it is what you expect of a brand hotel and you get what you expect for the price and nothing much more , and the location attracts a commensurate fee .

at 4am the efficient and free short shuttle ride direct to the airport makes one a bit happier about the room rate and very appreciative of not having to catch a taxi at 3:30am . . . .

we paid a bit more to get the executive room which was worth it for the free wifi , second floor location , slightly larger room etc .
