Yes, it'll make your computer run a bit slower but
Now my PC is really extremelly fast .
All the applications that I checked worked OK, although Photoshop opened slowly .
I had not experience any weird chokes or slowness that I had experienced in Vista .
,  opening applications is very slow .
It may be that Win7 is faster, sounder, prettier, etc .
