have been using this phone almost 2 years and love it  .

surprised i had the good fortune that it is viable and dependable  .

excellent choice  .

i rarely text but travel to canada often  .

this phone works flawless from the big city to the deep canadian woods with the right service  .

an excellent choice for any one , virtually anywhere .

fine  .

this phone is fantastic  .

i originally had the verizon blitz , which performed well , but did not meet my standards  .

i got the env touch yesterday , and i am thoroughly pleased with it  .

first of all , the phone is just gorgeous to look at  .

its very sleek and modern looking  .

second , it has amazing graphics  .

you can tell by just turning it on  .

it has incredible high definition  .

it also has a picture/video camera , that shoots in high definition , along with a touch screen , a flip    open keyboard , and music , email , vz navigator , and very cool games  .

the layout of the actual touch screen and keyboard is fabulous , and i had no trouble finding my way around  .

my favorite part of the phone probably has to be the notifications page , which you can access from the home touch screen  .

it tells you the volume of the phone , new messages , new voicemail , missed calls , calendar events , and alarm clock times  .

plus , you can get this whole phone for 149  .

99 , plus a 70  .

00 rebate  .

to me , this is a very good price for what you're getting in conclusion , this phone is , overall , fantastic  .

i would definently recommend this to a friend , because of the great features , incredible layout , and fabulous graphics  .

its definately competetion for any phone once you have the software upgraded from the factory version  .

i do recomend this phone to anyone .

i have had this phone for a few months now and love it i think it is the best phone i have ever had  .

i would totally say this phone is worth the money every penny of it  .

thanks to the engineers at lg for using their brains unlike many companies these days that just produce things that do not work and end up in landfills  .

lg's are known for longevity in life  .

key board is a nice size .

one amazing feature that is left out is its , im not sure the term  .

it has a sensor to know when it is next to your head , like durring a call , and when its not  .

unlike its predecessor where when you needed to press a key (say durring voicemail) where you would have to press the screen to get it to light up , and maybe press a wrong key  .

this phone knows when you pull it away from your head and automatically lights up the screen and gives options , dial pad , contacts , messageing , and even swap calls , for when you have a call waiting  .

it is amazing to not accidently hang up anymore , just because i have a touch screen phone  .

and thats just the tip of the iceburg  .

amazing phone .

i do like this phone very well  .

my experiance with this phone is good  .

i think the secerity is not very well like you could llock your messages or something  .

but i have mad tons of calls and texts  .

and it has worked fine , good service  .

but still the touch screen is veryyy bad sometimes  .

it makes me mad  .

if i click this message it will click the first message in my inbox which is an 1 hour old or so  .

i got a charger with my phone dont like it  .

it is a short cord , for the outlet  .

and than it come with a usb one  .

which is reallly annoying  .

because i am constenly on my comptuer which i dont like  .

my battery doesn ; t last threw my school dayy it does  .

but it is at 2/4 byyy when i get home ususally  .

which i love to text and if i text i loose more battery  .

but others over all i really love this phone  .

i encourge people to get it  .

i've looked for a phone for quite some time that had all the features that the lg env touch has , but being a guy it is really hard to find one that felt comfortable in my big hands  .

i have big hands and needed a qwerty key board that worked well enough and did not cause me to fight to find the keys or finding myself backspacing because i continued to hit the wrong keys i have yet to have that problem with this phone  .

everything about this phone screams easy to use and it is i would really recommend this phone to anyone  .

updated  .

on dec 4 , 2009  .

really loved this phone  .

great for texting  .

i really like the sound quality on it too  .

use it as my mp3 player  .

i recomend it to anyone  .

if you're thinking about getting this phone or another phone , go with this one  .

the battery life is fine  .

the touch screen is really nice , the internal qwerty is very nice , you never really use the touch screen to text  .

it's overall a greaat phone i've had it for about a month or two , no problems at all .

i love this phone because its really easy to use and rarly freezes its fast and has a great keyboard  .

i have been a verizon customer for over 10 years and between myself , friends and family , this is the best phone i have ever laid my hands on  .

my husband has a blackberry storm and i wouldn't trade him phones if you paid me  .

i have no major complaints about this phone and really cannot stop raving about it  .

two friends have bought the same phone after listening to me go on and on about how much i love this phone my only advice is to buy screen protectors right away  .

pretty common sense but absolutely a must  .

i do not have a protective case or covering on any other part of the phone and those areas have all held up well if you're on the fence about this phone , just buy it  .

you will love it  .

it's a great phone , i especially love all the features  .

i'm young , and i'm not very responsive  .

i do not take very good care of it  .

i've even dropped it in a pool , it still works perfect  .

this is a great upgrade from my motorola hint (which is nicknamed the beast for the hell i went through) i was not too keen on touch screen phones , since everyone had them , but the 3'in screen seduced me  .

it takes some getting used to with the sensitive touch screen , yet i have it down  .

videos from youtube are clear and well heard , the video games are amazing  .

i'm not used to fancy phones , so rotating the screen and scrolling through pictures fascinated me  .

i had an lg that had a flash yrs ago , and the env touch having a flash makes night pics awesome , so when i forget my dslr , i have a good alternative for photo ideas , or snapping a good moment drawing pad is fun , and i love to doodle  .

my fiance makes fun of me since i play on this phone most of the time  .

battery life is not great , yet it has alot going on so of course the battery life will be bad , yet car charges are great , and my hint's charger cable fits , so if i travel , i can leave one home design is nice , i really like the way it feels and i do not loose it as much since it's bigger than my hint  .

most of these reviews gave me the push to go buy it  .

so i hope this helps for others that were like me  .

i've had this phone for 3 days now , still learning , but enjoying  .

lgs are great , never gave me problems compared to pantechs and motorolas .

i highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a cell phone  .

it has tons of features and you can really personalize it with fonts , wallpapers , and more  .

i read some reviews that stated the phone cannot save photos and such to an external memory card  .

this is not true at all  .

all of my music , videos , and pictures are saved to my memory card i took from my old phone also , for all that the phone does it has a satisfactory battery life  .

the only time it dies super fast is when it is going in and out of a place where there is not a signal  .

and even then it lasts 24 hrs  .

the internet is clear and really fast  .

plus , it cheap  .

i currently have a ten dollar a month plan that allows me to get on the internet a lot  )  .

i also like how the touch can be calibrated to me specifically  .

at first i is hesitant to get a touchscreen phone but i am so glad i took the plunge  .

texting on the touch is much faster than texting on regular buttons  .

oh , and there are a bunch of ways to text and the screen is so big that it's super easy to read texts and web pages also , the phone is a good size  .

it weighs about the same as my evy2 but it is just a little taller  .

it still fits in my pocket which is convenient  .

it is sturdy but not bulky i am very pleased with my choice to purchase this phone  .

it is much better than my envy2 and has all of the features one could want in a phone  .

the envy touch is a fun phone that is reliable and easy to use  .

if you're in the market for a phone , by this one  .

you wo not be disappointed .

this phone is definetely amazing  .

i recommend it to anyone  .

the keyboard and the touchscreen are the best part  .

it is way better than the voyager .

its easy to use and for all of the people that complaine about it , just read the book or use what brain you have to understand it  .

i love this phone  .

i didn't think i would , but i is sorely mistaken  .

the touch interface is easy to use  .

the available functions are relatively easy to get to  .

the web browser is much better than the web broswer on my lg vx9400  .

i love that i can use the front for web navigation then switch to the keyboard for text entry without losing anything on the browser  .

the qwerty keyboard is easy for people with larger hands , like me  .

for web browsing using the touch screen you probably should have a stylus handy , though  .

fortunately my phone case has a slot specifically for a spare stylus the camera on this phone is wonderful  .

the quality is better than almost any other phone that's out there  .

cnet is wrong about video resolution , though  .

my env touch supports video at 640x480 and in a well    lit area easily gets at least 24 frames per second  .

the ability to place photos and videos directly to the microsd card without having to copy it manually is great if you're not used to the average two    day life of an lg battery , you'll be in for a bit of a shock , but lg has  finally  moved to using a usb cable for charging and data connectivity  .

there is no need to buy a separate cable any more i haven't used it as a media player ; however , by default it will try to sync up with your music if you've installed the vcast music (media manager) software  .

my sd card is from my old lg , so it is already configured  .

if you're using a new sd card , let the software build the media directories for you  .

(i think they're my_pix , my_music , etc  .

) you can then drag    and    drop your music files into the right directory if you insert the sd card into an appropriate card reader  .

it's much faster and easier than using media manager the accelerometer works well  .

my phone came with a demo of need for speed , in which you steer your car by tilting the phone and i love the panoramic function of the camera  .

you take a series of five photos by aligning a large yellow dot with a target circle on the screen  .

the dot is apparently generated by identifying a pattern in the picture that you just took  .

it then uses the accelerometer and that identified pattern to determine when the next part is correctly aligned and automatically takes the next photo  .

it really works incredibly well my only real gripes are that the phone has a tendency to reset itself maybe once a week and that the web browser and flash players are in desperate need of an update  .

some of the issues that i have with it is that the browser does not always detect the correct page width , especially when html frames are involved , and it appears that the flash player cannot play beyond flash v6 you should consider getting the phone through verizon wireless' web site  .

no rebates and it's significantly cheaper than the store  .

when i bought the phone , it had dropped to $50 after my qualifying new after two upgrade  .

i would have paid almost $170 in the store , and then would have had to wait for a d4mned $70 rebate  .

a bit pricy and over    featured for my needs , but the performance makes it worthwhile  .

battery life is very good , and the phone connects everywere , better than other phones i have used  .

would really love it if they found a way to make it a bit slimmer and lighter weight    but that's quibbling  .

get a screen protector    the front screen just seems too exposed .

before purchasing this phone i had the lg dare , and although it is an awesome phone , texting is challenging  .

i am a big texter , and this phone is excellent for that  .

it has the same features as the dare plus tons more  .

the design is a little bulky , but the full keyboard makes up for that  .

the option to choose either touch screen or not is great when you need to text or just prefer the buttons  .

the camera is awesome , with cool features the thing that is a little disappointing is the battery life  .

if you use the phone a lot , it wo not last you longer than a full day  .

this can sometimes get annoying , especially when it dies on you  .

but the extended battery can fix this problem easily the phone is easy and simple to use it's the dare plus tons more  .

it's perfect for a texter , or just anybody wanting a touch screen and a non touch screen .

i love this phone  .

i researched it for a full week    lots of reviews , website , youtube videos , and decided this is the phone for me  .

i'm super happy    it's got a really great touchscreen , and a roomy and easy to use qwerty keyboard  .

the camera takes excellent photos  .

i've had no problems with battery life    i charged it two days ago and still have 2 bars left , even with taking photos , web surfing , sending lots of messages  .

got the pink hard case from verizon and like that alot too  .

i love that you can plug it right into your computer to drag music and pictures onto the phone  .

having owned the voyager , dare , the original v , env , env 2 , env 3 , both chocolates and now the env touch , i can say that this is the single best cell phone i've ever had  .

the quality overall is superb  .

nothing feels cheap , the qwerty keys are slightly (perfectly) raised and spaced to make texting easier than ever  .

lg managed to make the touch smaller than the voyager and yet give it larger screens and more keypad space  .

amazing  .

lg took the advanced really cool features in the dare and put them into the touch       dockable icons , a proximity sensor that automatically turns off the front lcd while in a call , an accelerometer that rotates the display 90 degrees for viewing photos (which you can zip through quickly with a flick of a finger , or use the outer qwerty virtual keyboard , or use it for scrolling through music titles i've read so    called pro reviews on websites and most strike me as a bit snobbish  .

meaning nit    picking  .

there is , in actual daily use , almost nothing to complain about with this phone i mean just how many goodies can one expect  .

it is first and foremost a great cell phone  .

but having an incredible 3  .

2 macro auto    focus hi rez camera with a quality german lens and a hi rez (640x800) camcorder    the best in any cell phone to date and a music player that with good earphones (it uses a 3  .

5mm headphone jack) that easily rivals an ipod , a photo editor and the ability to set pretty much any photo as  .

the outer screen wallpaper with just your finger to move and resize it , plus many other little but significant features , there really is no room for reviewers to imply the touch is ho    hum , just another lg  .

not hardly there were , to be sure , issues (when it is released a couple months ago) with battery life  .

the newest firmware version 4 did correct the problems  .

overall , i recommend this phone as highly as possible the bottom line is   lg and verizon knocked the ball outa the park with the env touch  .

if it had the volume levels for ringers that the env 3 has , this phone would rate over 100% as it is , it gets 10 stars and 100% .

this is amazing  .

i love this phone  .

its agreat phone , it charges fast and i havent found a thing like it  .

go and get your self one ,  .

ve had the lg touch for 5 days and i am really happy with my decision to go with this phone over the omnia  .

i believe that the omina will be a great smart phone when they get the new omnia ii (or whatever they are calling the next version) and running under windows mobile 6  .

5 with native touch screen capability  .

right now for surfing and accessing my emails (hotmail and earthlink) this is the right phone at the right price ($15/mo vcast data plan is all that is needed for unlimited data/surfing) there are a number of  .

cons  .

about the touch that have been reported and which caused me to think twice about this phone  .

based on my experience , don  .

t bother to worry first is the battery life  .

in general i see 3 bars of battery after a day of talking , texting and some surfing  .

i am not a big time multi    hour on the phone person , but i don  .

t expect not to charge the phone at night or have a charger in my car  .

so far , from my pov , it is not an issue warm battery  .

my lg chocolate would also get very warm if i is on the phone for an hour  .

no different with the lg touch  .

battery discharge will create heat ; nothing excessive or beyond what i expected resets  .

ve had one reset occur during a web surfing episode  .

however , i did get an error message asking  .

if i wanted to continue running the script  .

as it would slow the web page refresh  .

i normally selected  .

yes ,  .

but this time i went with  .

soon thereafter , the phone rebooted  .

not sure what the  .

script  .

issue was , but i have not had any reboots with either texting or with voice i  .

ve been able to connect to my hotmail and earthlink accounts simply by providing the email address and password  .

one downside is that only text will be displayed so if there are some embedded graphics ; expect to see html code rather than text  .

web pages show graphics , so don  .

t worry that did you know you can sent picture/video from the text message side to an email by just typing recipient  .

s email address in the  .

cell where you would put a cell phone number  .

it arrives with your cell phone number and the extension  .

@vzwpix  .

com  .

i have large hands , but find the tapping the keys not an issue even using one hand and thumb  .

touch screen sensitivity is set at default and i have not adjusted it  .

surfing can be a bit tedious moving the cursor , but there are 10 nav buttons that can be popped up to help navigate move  .

there is a  .

manage windows  .

button on the menu which is great to get rid of any unwanted pop    up window  .

i need to work on the  .

touch and slide  .

to move pages up and down , but that is just practice not an issue manual is heavy on how , but provides little background such as technique for moving the pages via the touch and slide  .

support says to look at the forums and faqs but is very clear if i had a question to just call ; kudos for good customer support  .

look this is a great phone that will do most of what smartphones do at a fraction of the cost  .

if you are on the fence , don  .

t be , just get one  .

ease of use  .

having the option of the touch screen and being able to flip it open at times is great  .

the full key board is a great feature .

great phone that is good for anyone .

i is looking to get a new phone since i had joined twitter and i am not a fan of t9 typing  .

after playing with a few at the verizon store , i decided to go with this one due to its large touch screen and full keyboard  .

the last 3 phones i've owned were flip/clamshells and i is getting tired of that form factor  .

this one has become a pleasant change , especially with its touch screen and the keyboard  .

both external and internal screens are bright and colorful  .

they keyboard has enough space for my big paws to type on with ease in regards to battery life , i have not had the problems that most people have mentioned in their reviews  .

since my acquisition of the phone earlier this week , i have only needed to charge it twice  .

one thing i did is to shut off the vibrating feedback for the touch screen  .

if anything is going to drain the battery , this will be it .

this is probably one of the best phones you can get on verizon unless you are a business user who needs a smartphone  .

the camera has been very improved and they assed a flash but it still lacks a self portrait mirror  .

they improved the screen resolution and colors and pictures really pop on the screen  .

it has evdo rev a which is one of the fastest 3g speeds around  .

the camera is amazing  .

it has flash , autofocus , smile and face detection , panorama mode , and much much more  .

it is probably one of my favorite phones on verizon and i strongly recommend it .

best phone verizon has to offer  .

i admit i have spent a lot of time reading , studying , reviewinf the verizon web site , and in a couple of cases visiting my verizon store (they have all the answers   ) to gain knowledge of this excellent product since i purchased it and i know i made the right choice  .

this is the best roi out there  .

sorry blackberry bye bye ipod lg has trumped you both  .

(jimiznhb)  .

it's a solid phone  .

try it yourself , but do not let the verizon guy try to up    sell you a blackberry , they make more commission off the blackberry  .

they will try to sell you the blackberry even though the envy is the better phone  .

try it for yourself .

the keyboard is soo easy to use  .

i used to have the at t tilt and it is very difficult to type  .

i is constantly deleting keys that i pressed on accident , quite annoying , but on the env touch they are nicely spread out and easy to feel  .

the internet is very fast , the service is great , the camera takes great pics , and i love all the phone has to offer  .

overall , i love the phone  .

switched to verizon after 10 years+ of lackluster at t service phones and shoddy support  .

the phone always has a great connection , connects right away to the navigation service (which doesn't leave me lost and wandering like at t) and is easy to use (i have not opened the instruction booklet yet) .

i will be honest   i is very hesitant to buy this phone  .

i looked at all the reviews and read all the articles on various websites and is very interested  .

i is afraid , however , of the battery life  .

i heard horror stories from owners who had their battery die only a few hours after charging  .

i is standing in the verizon store trying to decide between this or the env3  .

the salesman is very good and told me if i was not happy with the touch , i could bring it back and they would wave the restocking fee  .

i figured it is worth a shot  .

i took it home two weeks ago and i have not been happier cnet has a pretty good review  .

i would only add a couple of things  .

the document viewer is a little disappointing  .

i have no problem opening any  .

doc or  .

pdf files  .

it is a little slow with  .

pdfs , however  .

the screen seems just a tad small for doc  .

viewer  .

but , if you're not reading  .

war and peace ,  .

i think you will be okay the other things i will comment on is the battery issue  .

i have had no troubles whatsoever  .

i bought the phone on a monday afternoon and did not have to charge it until thursday night  .

(i had it off for about 3 hours while on a plane  .

i turned on airplane mode and played tetris for a while ) during that time , i made about a dozen 15 min phone calls and sent about 50 text messages  .

give it a good first charge and you should have no problems  .

bottom line   this phone is great  .

(and it's fun to play with the touch screen  .

i normally do not write reviews about products i just read them to help me make a better decision but this phone just blew me away  .

i had a blackberry storm before this and well the env touch blows it out of the water  .

yes i know its not a smartphone and all but when it comes to everything else  .

the camera is a 3  .

2mp just like the blackberry but it has so many more options and editing features  .

it also has an actual keyboard ( this may not matter to some people , but having all touch screen all the time can get a little annoying) it has great features the internet renders just like it does on the blackberry browser and it has tabbed browsing allowing you to open more than one webpage at a time while on the web  .

(something the blackberry could not do) overall it is a great phone tho and pretty nice to look at and a lot smaller than my storm was  .

i hope this helps people decide if you were debating between this and the storm anyway .

i like the touch because of the media attributes that it offers  .

the mega pixels on the envy touch are 3  .

1 over just 2  .

0 with most other camera phones  .

with the touch you get the ease of a touch screen interface plus the benefits of a conventional when you open it  .

further , with the touch , the qwerty key pad is better designed than many other phones  .

key pads with the touch you can use the exterior screen as well as the interior and let your internet venture be a tactile 'touch screen' experience  .

the touch screen is very good and does not need for you to press your whole finger on it  .

you can just tap it with your finger nail  .

on a side note , there is a pleasure in knowing that you are not 'stuck' having to use a touch screen  .

with the touch , you have the option of using either the internal physical key pad or the external touch screen for any of the phone options for your phone's desktop , you can use animated gif images , video clips as well as static photos  .

if you do use just a photo , you are not constricted by size or dimension  .

you have the ability to adjust it to fit the screen or adjust it and zoom at a particular portion of the photo additionally , with the touch you have a slew of software capabilities that permit you to edit both photos and videos  .

more so , ring tones can easily be 'created' by just having them assigned from any of the sounds in your 'sound folder' , regardless of the length  .

just as long as they are in the appropriate formats ; mp3 , aac , wma  .

further , it has the potential for expansion to either 8 gb or 16 gb removable memory now on to specifics  .

the menu interface has two options  .

both are easy to use and navigate  .

i personally prefer the default over the more modern  .

the external key pad can be used either in qwerty format or conventional  .

it does not come with a stylus as it does not need one  .

again , the key pad is responsive , consistent and can be calibrated to suit your touch the touch does have a drawing pad  .

i liked it but found that here is a function that could have used a stylus  .

it is kind of a cheesy little thing to play with , but it can be used as a successful distraction to while away some time  .

as for the battery life , it is good  .

the only thing i found that really drained the battery is the web access  .

other than that , even video viewing did not pose a significant drain on the battery  .

pretty much i find that i have more than just a day's use of the phone , and i stress 'use'  .

after all , why have what you're not going to use the camera on the touch is a 3  .

1 mp over most other phones  .

0 mp  .

the clarity of the pics of the touch are beyond just 'good' for a camera phone , they are great  .

the only draw back of the camera feature is the time delay from start/pointing to actually clicking/ saving the pic to your phone (about 7    8 seconds)  .

but the quality makes it so worth the wait there are several editing tools that the may be of use  .

some of the things you can do with photos are   crop ; adjust color/brightness/contrast/etc ; rotate ; create or adjust facial expressions ; write a message or notation ; add a fun frame ; and add fun props over the pics  .

with videos , you can edit for length  .

you can either shorten it for video message sending or just simply remove a portion of it that you want taken out  .

overall , i would suggest the touch over most other phones .

i love this phone  .

it is very stylish and sleek  .

yes it dose have a short battery life but the more you use and charge it the better it gets  .

i love the features and design  .

this is my second flip (to the side) phone  .

and it love it  .

i have had 3 qwerty keyboard phones and this is the best so far  .

and even though it has a few things missing it is still an amazing phone  .

i love it and i think any one would  .

it is a fantastic phone .

i upgraded from the original env (vx9900) and i've had this phone for a little over 3 weeks now , and i can say without a doubt this is the best dumbphone verizon has to offer  .

it is superior in almost every single feature by itself , and as an overall phone it is unmatched  .

and i'm not saying this as a biased fanboy , i thoroughly researched the phone before and after i purchased it but enough of that , on to the pros and cons  .

i think most of what i wrote is pretty self explanatory , so i'll just emphasize a few things    .

touch screen   this is the first touch screen phone i've owned , and to me , it is great  .

i find it very responsive and to work quite well , the learning curve is perhaps an hour or two at most  .

is the screen comparable to the iphone  .

definitely not  .

the iphone is capacitive and the touch is resistive , just yesterday i used my sister's ipod touch and found much more responsive than the touch (likewise , my sister had trouble getting using the touch because she is used to her ipod touch)  .

so for people used to an iphone    like responsiveness for touchscreens , this may be a disappoint  .

but for people like me who have never really used a touch screen before , this is perfect    battery   yes , i'm sure you've all heard it , the battery sucks  .

a lot  .

now i dont even have internet/data or any add on applications (including texting) , i use my phone solely for making calls  .

i also leave the bluetooth off unless im actually using it , i usually keep my phone off at night and at work , and never charge overnight  .

despite all this , i cant even make it a week without having to charge again (usually around 4 days)  .

playing the game demos will eat up a full bar , as will listening to music for about 2 hours  .

good news is , i've heard the extended battery works wonders  .

bad news is , verizon is all sold out but when they're back in stock , i'll update this (i also hear using bat30 as a coupon will chop $15 off the price tag)    if you're like me and dont have a camera or music player , i think you'll like the touch  .

sure , its no ipod or standalone camera , but its the best in its class as far as phones go (the casio exilim and samsung omnia are the only verizon phones that rival the camera) , and its one of the few that actually have a 3  .

5 mm jack  .

i especially like the panorama option on the camera and the equalizer controls on the music player  .

oh and the flash is amazing compared to what i had on the original env , this one actually works , haha  .

my only gripe with camera is that you cant use the external display when you open the phone (using it a portrait mirror like you could in the first env)  .

as for the music player , i like how you can now shuffle through your playlists , however , when the phone is open and music is playing , you cannot browse songs , you can only skip/change songs  .

in the original env , you can use the up/down nav keys to browse songs , in the touch , the up/down adjusts the volume  .

i find this a huge setback because it you would only ever listen to music with the phone open , so why cant you search through your library while you're playing music  .

video playback   playing videos is as beautiful as it will get on a phone with the 16 , 777 , 216 color/480x800 pixel screen (compare that with the dare , while having the same size screen it is only 262 , 144 color/240x400 pixel , a huge difference  .

and with 16gb micro sd card , you'll have plenty of room for movies  .

i had a little trouble formatting movies at first , but i found this method and it works great    .

net/lg    env/t250088    convert    put    videos    your    env    lg    vx9900  .

html  .

well thats enough out of me , bottom line   you want a multimedia phone that can do it  .

the touch is yours   full html browsing , spacious and comfortable qwerty keyboard for texting , excellent screen for vcast and games (not to mention you use the rotational sensor for games  .

) , and being able to use it as a modem to tether to your laptop (though apparantly there are issues with this , theoretically it should work) this phone is for you  .

stop reading and go get it if you're a cheap scrooge like me who wont pay a dime more than he has to , and wants his phone to be a camera/music player , this phone is still for you  .

this is as far as i know the only verizon phone that offers game demos (need4speed , tetris , resident evil) , it has one of the best cameras out there , an excellent music player , great qwerty for typing notes or entering in contacts , microsoft office/pdf viewer , best screen resolution available , and did i mention its cheap  .

$50 ladies and gentlemen , i have to think lg is losing money on this  .

even at $100 (without the new every two rebate) , its still a bargain the only reason you should not buy this phone is if you want a phone with 1) strong battery life 2) physical t9 keypad or 3) a really tiny phone 4) no price tag whatsoever (aka , you're such a scrooge you wont even pay for a phone) so  .

you got questions  .

ask away  .

updated  .

on jul 10 , 2009  .

its all so nice its really cool  .

this phone is gona rock you out  .

lg , awsome job  .

best phone if you choose to go with verizon  .

i really like this phone verizon wisely this time allowed to let this phone be seen as a mass storage device , so you simple hook up to the usb cable and you can download/upload music , phone camera pictures , upload photos for wall paper , ringtones , mp4 movies or video clips , etc with zero issues nice  .

honestly before this phone i think in the last ten years i've sent less than 100 text messages because all my phones 10 key and im sorry every phone i had the t9 is crap , flip the phone open big beautiful qwerty keyboard and even with a my big hands texting and emailing is breeze i think i sent close to a hundred in the last week  .

i upgrade my plan i went with the premium 450 to take advantage of all the great media , v cast has some very decent time killing entrainment value with full tv episodes , sports and stuff  .

and honestly i think the verizon navgator is going to take over for my garmin gps  .

also i havent had any issues with receiption with this phone is as good or even better in most areas were my old phone motorola z6tv which had excellent receiption i have yet to find a place here in so cal were i could not get service , and unlike the ipoo 3g if i cant get decent evdo rev a it always rolls back to 1x network so i can always send and receive voice calls or texts where as the ipoo 3g does not have a decent 2g radio so you usual sol if you cant get decent 3g , not the case with the touch  .

yes i agree it doesnt even have 2% of the apps the iphone has but really 95% of the iphone apps are crap , fart sounds and baby shakers , etc sorry and the iphone a very wonkie as a cell phone to boot  .

for how i use a phone the lg touch is almost perfect phone , first and formost it a great cell phone and texting /emailing machine , it got a decent camera (dont throw out the dslr but also does video) , easily excessiable sd card slot (got a 16gb) and its loaded with cool features the touch with its evdo rev a you have smooth access fun smooth steaming vcast and the extremely useful verizon navigator , web and mobile email , if your looking for a solid mulitmeda photo this is a very hard phone to beat  .

and if the size is too big for you give the lg env 3 a long look it has most of the great features of the lg touch but it a more compact size so far i really love this phone and if you have a ne 2 you can get for a steal like i did getting for basically sales tax .

the bottom line is that for what you are getting at the price you are getting this at , this phone is the bomb  .

i love using it  .

it's simple to use  .

great interface  .

the touch screen is not the best , but i'm sure they'll address that in the software update (which you can do from your phone instead of going to the verizon store)  .

all the great reviews are on point  .

if you look anywhere else , you won't see a phone for verizon better rated than this phone  .

if you live in the city and never leave , go get an iphone  .

if you live anywhere other than the city , you wo not find coverage and a phone combo better than verizon wireless and the env touch .

i purchased this phone june 9th without doing much research  .

my prior phone is a 3    4 yr  .

old basic lg flip  .

i truly lucked out as this phone is a marvel  .

i wanted something that would combine a cell with the features i liked about my old palm for contacts and calendaring  .

because i couldn't afford the data/subscription charges associated with a blackberry and not open to switching to at t for an iphone , i have found the env touch with the vpak pricing a good alternative i appreciate the cnet review and the submitted reviews by readers because i've learned much about the phone    even after reading the owner's manual  .

so thank you all  .

after reading about the price drop that occured just two days after purchasing the phone , i called verizon as suggested and got $50 credited to my account i have been an existing rhapsody customer for 5 years , but did not use it to sync to an external device  .

i called them up to negoiate a better price than the $15/month that verizon is offering for vcast music , which is the same thing  .

i is already paying rhapsody 9  .

95/month (i pay 1 year in advance , all at once , to get that price) and is able to get the rhapsody to go (right to transfer to several external devices) for just two more dollars a month negatives   as stated , the browsing is tricky and kind of slow to respond , but enlarging the screen via zoom helps  .

i'd love to try the vz navigator , but cannot justify the additional cost at this time  .

i hope they drop the prices on the games , and create apps games that are similar to the iphone's  .

many of the menus are too complicated    you have to click and click and search and search  .

notes are a good example    this is an app i use a lot and would love for it to be more readily available and better written  .

calendar is ok    again a lot of clicking to set up just one entry  .

contacts , which is important to me (remember i'm replacing my palm) should have the ability to add a second line to the name for a business , like dr  .

john doe , meadowood clinic and a line that accepts miscellaneous text postives   i'm a newby when it comes to using a cell phone for retrieving email and web browsing  .

so despite what i said above re   browsing , it is still pretty cool and generally works  .

i have three email accounts set up and the access speed is excellent , the emails very readable  .

i have tried the mobile version of my internet banking and it works well  .

i have tried the mobile version of facebook a few times and that has not been quite as successfull , but okay in a pinch  .

camera is very good quality  .

i text a lot , using the internal and external screens  .

keyboard is wonderful  .

it has nice interface with fun options like font styles and colors i'm extremely pleased with the music player  .

i own bose ear buds and the sound quality is just as good as my ipod  .

transferring songs from my rhapsody client on my pc to the phone works very smoothly and quickly  .

the music player is probably my favorite feature i've had the phone for 2 1/2 weeks now and it's getting easier to use as i learn my way around  .

thanks again for all the reviews as i've learned much from each of you  .

i appreciate the cnet review and  .

i love lg and this is my favorite phone i've had of theirs so far  .

the touch screen is awesome and it's great to be able to browse the web or get updates for email or social sites like facebook or myspace  .

i had the lg env before and loved it but this one is even better and i love the layout of the keypad  .

great phone  .

it iz the bomb  .

{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}_________________________     .

whether your a big time texter or just want the coolest phone on the market , you will be very happy with this phone .

i upgraded from the lg dare  .

do not get me wrong the dare is a great phone over all  .

i loved it but this phone is much better for texting  .

i loved the virtual keyboard on the dare but i have to say the full qwerty keyboard on the inside is a lot better but you can also use the outside virtual qwerty keyboard as well which i sometimes use overall i recommend this phone  .

i wanted to make sure i actually got used to this phone so that i could write an educated , experienced review  .

i've had this phone for about a week , and i have never been so pleased with a cellphone so where do i even begin  .

bare in mind that my previous phone is an env  .

fancy little gadgets and knick    knacks were just things that other people had on their phones  .

not me  .

so i'm probably impressed with things that most people are already used to    forgive me  .

i honestly shunned touch screens before this phone  .

the actual reason i wanted this phone in the first place is for the animated wallpaper    the night sky one equipped with twinkling , and shooting stars , trees that sway in the wind , and fireflies  .

the exterior is nice    the chrome is attractive  .

i've read complaints about the texture at the bottom of the phone on the front where the buttons are , and that it holds fingerprints    honestly , i don't notice it  .

besides , with a case , you do not have to worry about it  .

i do wish they had made this phone in a couple more colors  .

i liked the blue buttons on the env3  .

anyway , let's get to the juicy details  .

the touch screen is great  .

i find myself constantly playing with the little curtain which unveils the screen  .

it's very entertaining for those easily amused  .

i like that you can keep this little curtain down and still view the date and time  .

the transparency and glow when this curtain is down is nice  .

the curtain unveils a beautiful touch screen  .

the shortcuts at the bottom of the screen are nice  .

one of the best things about this screen is that (aside from the locked shortcuts at the bottom) you can move any widgets anywhere on the screen  .

the memo widget is great  .

you can make a little note , and then place it right on your screen so you see it every time you unveil your front screen  .

it's just like a little sticky note  .

very convenient  .

you can also move the time and date icon to wherever you want on the screen  .

the drawing tool is fantastic  .

extremely similar to the iphone's  .

i also like how the notepad tool displays your note on a lined paper background  .

it's just very fancy  .

the functionality of the touch screen is excellent  .

it's adequately accurate and responsive , and the vibration as you touch is nice  .

it's nice that you can adjust how strong , and how long that vibration is i'm a huge texter , so that is one of my priorities with this phone  .

i love being able to open the phone to use the keyboard , but to be honest , i probably use the front screen almost as much  .

i like to use the regular keypad and use t9  .

it's also nice to be able to use a keyboard on the front if wanted , just by flipping the phone on it's side  .

i love the layout of the messages  .

it's nice to display messages by contact , it's like looking at an instant message conversation  .

the photo id that accompanies each message is just awesome  .

the internal keyboard itself is very nicely spaced out , and the keys have a nice give i do wish there were more display themes other than the 2 offered  .

neither are all that great what is great is the starry sky animated wallpaper  .

i said to myself that this phone is made for me as soon as i saw it the games are epic  .

tilting your phone to steer the car in need for speed rules anyway , moving on  .

the camera on this phone is superior  .

it takes very crisp photos  .

looking at photos on the external touch screen is a blast  .

you can scroll through them in the same manner as the iphone  .

the slide show option is great  .

the options to edit the photos are also wonderful  .

looking at photos internally is also nicely done  .

i love the ability to adjust an image before setting it as your wallpaper  .

video quality is also good the actual call quality on this phone is great  .

loud , and clear i do have a few complaints  .

when trying to use the beautify photo editing tool , the phone restarts  .

i've googled , and discovered it is not just my phone  .

not a big deal  .

the phone is a little heavy for my preference  .

again , not a show stopper  .

the battery life is meh , not the best  .

sometimes there's a lag when i text internally (could just be i text too dang fast)  .

occasionally the internal screen is black for a moment , and i have to hit a bunch of keys before it re    appears one complaint i've always had with phones is the inability to clear entry field of a text  .

it is annoying to have to start a whole new message when sending multiple page texts to non    verizon people i will say this    i had to return my first phone because the right side of the screen ended up completely malfunctioning , but verizon quickly replaced it  .

honestly , i have no qualms about it  .

this phone is new  .

there are going to be glitches that are going to happen , and it will take time before software upgrades come out  .

it's normal i wish i had more room , but , in conclusion , i continue to discover things with this phone that assure me it is the right choice for my upgrade , and that i'll certainly be happy with it for the next 2 years .

easy to use index screen at a touch , easy to use text message , and with a great browser  .

i am replying to a text message before the old style is even out of the pocket  .

i am now the fastest in the west  .

period  .

for all the newbs out there , here's the score ~  .

this is not a smartphone  .

don't expect too much out of it if you previously had a blackberry , palm , etc  .

although it doesn't have a windows based os , you can view documents in  .

pdf , ppt , excel word (not alter , just read)  .

despite some comments i've read on other sites , you can easily use this phone as a usb mass storage device  .

put the micro sd card in phone  .

the first step is format the sd card , do that under settings tools , scroll down to memory , select card , click format on the bottom  .

this will create separate folders for your music , pix , flix , documents , etc  .

now plug usb cord into both phone pc  .

go into the phone's settings tools  .

click tools , scroll down , click usb mass storage  .

your pc will then recognize a new external storage device  .

too simple , huh  .

now open the folder on your pc and start clicking dragging to your heart's content  .

even your drm    free itunes note   prior to putting videos on your phone , you might consider compressing them , depending on the gb size of your sd card  .

it does not play flash (flv) , but wmv , 3gp , 3g2 videos are fine i've had this thing a week it continues to impress  .

i like to stay current with the newest phones that comes out , because of that i have had the voyager , the dare , and most recently the bb storm  .

i have to say that this is the best phone of the bunch hands down  .

it is a perfect mix of dare's touch screen , and the voyagers keyboard  .

the ui is fantastic and everything is incredibly snappy  .

i is very hesitant about switching from a smartphone to a dumbphone like this  .

however i can tell you i havent been happier  .

i pay for vcast so i have internet access just like i did on my bb , and i have certain pages favorited (facebook , espn etc etc) and it is just like having the app on my bb , but half the price per month  .

you can also have mobile im which is nice , just make sure you have an unlimited texting plan with that or you will burn through your texts pretty fast i think one of the coolest little extras in the env touch is the ability to change your font color  .

i know its very minor , but it is a nice addition and something that is often overlooked  .

i love the speed of the phone as a whole  .

the the accelerometer is very snappy , taking the camera zooms , focuses , and takes high quality pictures very fast  .

the video camera is also pretty good from the little bit i have used it thus far  .

the touch screen is much more responsive then the voyagers is also , which makes texting in t9 very easy all in all i say that this is bar none one of the best cell phones vzw has put out in the last year or 2  .

its a featured filled phone for a reasonable price  .

if you are up to renew your contract pick it up for sure , or if you dont mind shelling out $410 bucks for it , pick it up anyway , you wont be disappointed .

my last phone is a lg chocolate 2 , i is looking for a more text friendly phone , and i found it  .

i love the touch screen front , but then the full qwerty keyboard makes texting so much easier than just the touchscreen keyboard the camera does take great pictures when the flash does not white me out completely this phone is larger than my last phone , but not too large to fit inside of my pockets easily , and compared to other touchscreen phones i saw it's quite slim i definitely recommend this phone to any texter  .

i think this phone is a great phone , and is a nice combination of the top three phones from verizon (lg dare , lg env2 , lg voyager)  .

i think that the blackberry curve is vzw's top device , but i put that more as a pda phone rather than a regular phone with extra features (which is what the lg phones i listed above)  .

i've had many phones from verizon for about 10 years now , i have three lines in my account and i upgrade my phone every year and the two other lines every other year  .

i will have to say that this is the best phone to come out of verizon  .

the keyboard options are nice , though i find myself using the virtual more (i am used to the lg dare)  .

i like the animated scroll (though not as nice as the htc touch diamond or pro , but again , these two are more pda phones than regular phones) the camera is quite impressive (3  .

2 mp) and the large screen size makes taking pictures a lot easier i tested the data speed (via dslreports) and the reported speed is 812 kbit/sec , which is slower than my lg dare (i got 1185 kbit/sec)  .

i placed the phones on the same spot on my desk when i is running the tests , and ran one test per phone (one after the other) for 5 tests , and these are the average speeds of the 5 tests  .

i'm not sure why the touch is slightly slower , given that both are evdo rev  .

i will next test the mobile broadband speed of both (results pending) the only negative feature i found is the disappointing battery life  .

i charge it overnight , take it off the charger at 7am , go to work , and by 2pm it has half the battery  .

this is consistent over the last 5 days i've had the phone  .

i've even performed a hard reset (took the battery off while the phone is still on , waited over 30 sec , replaced the battery , turned the unit on , and charged overnight)  .

no change in the battery life  .

i remember this is an issue with the lg dare when it first came out a year ago , but the issue with the lg env touch is worse  .

i hope lg comes out with a fix for this (like they did with the dare , and the battery life became significantly better) altogether , i have been very happy and impressed with this phone  .

having tested this unit thoroughly and extensively , i will highly recommend this phone  .

i am still running some more tests (bluetooth , mobile broadband tethering , mobile web browsing , apps like vz navigator , etc  .

) , and i will update this review in about a week .

i love this phone because it has everything that i need  .

it gets the job done and the price is awsome for all that i got and use my phone for .

bottom line is i've had my motorola razr since the day it is available over 3  .

5 years ago  .

since then i've been watching the phones that verizon has released hoping for a real iphone competitor  .

dont make any mistake , this isnt an iphone  .

but this is the best phone that doesnt quite make it to iphone standards  .

plus you're not tied to atts expensive and required iphone plans  .

aside from lack of as many apps as the iphone has and the larger screen of the iphone , this rivals and beats it on many points also this has a surprisingly nice music player for a cell phone  .

also the camera on this gets surprisingly close to what a cell phone camera should act like (a real camera)  .

i waited 3  .

5 years with a razr on verizon  .

this phone is more than worth it to cash in the 2 year service contract on updated  .

on jun 11 , 2009  .

i previously owned the original env and is really wanting something new  .

the env2 just felt very cheap and i is not impressed  .

so the decision is between the new env3 and the evtouch and i went with the touch  .

this is a great phone  .

love that you have phone vertical and landscape modes when the phone is turned  .

the full html browser is better but still has its kinks  .

really looked for more games to come out for this phone  .

worth every penny .

i have had a ton of verizon phones  .

my friends constantly tease me for switching every month  .

i have had everything from the motorola q to the alias to every blackberry known to man  .

i is bored of them all and is looking for a phone that would not only work well but have some fun built into it  .

i is about to get my third dare , not because it broke but because i is switching back again  .

then i signed on to cnet and read about the env touch  .

it seemed to have everything i wanted from the dare and everything i liked about the alias i went to the store right away , played with it and walked out with it paying full retail  .

i can say that this is the best verizon phone i have owned thus far  .

if i want my e    mail (like the blackberry) i just jump onto the web and read it , after adding my inbox to my favorites it is quite easy , if i want to respond with the touch qwerty keyboard i can do that without flipping the device open , if i do however want to reply with a tactile keyboard i can do that as well just by flipping it open  .

i use twitter and facebook a lot and after saving both my accounts to my favorites on the browser it is very easy to update i read on here , before i went to the store , that the device does not have an accelermoter for the touch keyboard , i is thankful to see that is not the case , it does have one and it is very good  .

there are also all sort of neat little things that not only work well but make sense and are very intuitive user    friendly i do not think i will be switching for a long time as i like this phone a lot  .

i have never written on here but wanted to because these user reviews as well as the cnet review helped me make this decision and i wanted to add my two cents in case it helps someone else .

i absolutely love this phone  .

last summer i got a dare when it came out  .

i realy wanted the voyager but it's screen is smaller , the camera didn't even have a flash , the touch screen was not as responsive , i didn't like it's ui as much (even though they were very similar) , the keyboard is good overall but had a few quirks , it didn't support as many bluetooth profiles  .

i could go on and on  .

it is the phone you realy wanted to love but just couldn't  .

the dare had mostly everything i wanted except for the physical qwerty  .

i fell in love with the dare and i still think it's a realy good phone  .

but lg has seemingly built my dream phone and voila the lg env touch  .

gone is mobile tv , but i never planned on using that anyway (the dare doesn't have it either)  .

this , of course is probably to make way for all the other wonderful things about it  .

it's thinner , has a camera with the same specs as the dare , yet offers even more features software    wise (the dare is already one of the best verizon camera phones out there) , it has a screen even more responsive than the dare , an updated interface and some cool new features up it's sleeve  .

one that i didn't have room for in the pros section is threaded text messaging  .

yes , this phone does threaded text messaging  .

i've hardly seen this talked about anywhere i've wanted it forever and now i got it  .

sweetness  .

there's just so much good stuff to say about this phone  .

lg clearly spent a lot of time working on the details  .

everything seems to be in a certain place for a reason , every angle of the phone has a clearly defined shape  .

closing the phone gives a nice gentle yet solid snap effect' which makes it feel high    end and the phone specificaly has little notches in just the right places so that even if you snapped it shut realy hard , it wouldn't hurt the screen  .

there are lots of little details like this that just make me enjoy owning this phone i don't know how else to describe it  .

as you can tell , i love the phone but what about the bad things  .

well , first off the battery life is not spectactular  .

there is a reason for this though  .

this phone is quite thin for having two 3  .

0 inch screens , a qwerty keyboard , and a camera plus all the other electronics (bluetooth , cell radio , microprocessor , etc  .

as a result it comes with a 950 mah battery , which is fairly low    capacity  .

that is the reason for the poor battery life  .

the phone is actualy quite efficient and uses the battery capacity quite well  .

plus , i'm sure you can get an extended    life battery if you realy need one  .

when the dare came out , it had good battery life then lg released a software update and it's battery life increased dramaticaly and became amazing  .

i wouldn't be surprised if something similar happens this time around too  .

from what i understand , lg has a history of this and did the same thing with the voyager  .

but again , just to stress this , the battery life is not bad just not amazing  .

so what else  .

okay , well here's my biggest gripe personaly (wimply because of it's shear stupidity) the tetris game  .

everyone knows what tetris is  .

you have a vertical box in which shapes drop down and you have to position them and rotate them in such a way that they fit together to complete a row  .

the game is simple , fun , and addictive  .

i love tetris on my dare , it worked beautifuly  .

not so on the env touch  .

so what exactly is wrong with it  .

well , the game is oriented in the stupidest way possible horizontaly and it does not listen to the accelerometer  .

basicaly , it wastes a lot of screen real estate and becomes a small box because the box itself is vertical , yet is displayed horizontaly  .

the closest thing i can think of to describe this is watching 4  3 content on a widescreen with no enlargement , so that there are black bars on either side  .

but in the game , it's just blue from the surrounding tetris background  .

yes , this is how the game is and no , believe me , it does not listen to the accelerometer  .

i have complained about this to verizon and hopefuly their technical guys will fix it soon  .

but it realy sucks because i love tetris and it's a perfect game for a cell phone  .

the third thing that bothers me is the i/m client specificaly the fact that the thing looks like it is designed for windows 95  .

alas , this i can not realy blame on lg it's not their doing , it's verizon's  .

still , i wish it was not so  .

not the phones fault , but still disappointing so yeah that's about it  .

i realy love the phone , definitely recommnd it  .

i got it for $120 not a bad deal at all  .

feel free to ask any questions ~seth  .

i agree with the cnet reviewer , this is one of the best phones verizon offers  .

it is packed with as many features as your going to find on a non    smartphone  .

there are really only two issues  .

the touch screen gets greasy fast (common among touch screen phones , even the iphone)  .

and the e    mail program is crap    its the same program found on many other (older) verizon phones and is slugish , lack html support , and is very much outdated  .

it is not even worth the $5 they charge for it  .

however i had a fine time accessing my e    mail via the browser  .

as for the lack of mobile tv , you won't miss it  .

mobile tv never worked well and it looks like verizon has abondoned it overall you wo not be disapointed with this phone  .

i had to pay full retail because i waisted my new every two on a craptastic phone  .

i still think it is worth the money and am thrilled with the performance also something i found is that this phone support ota updates  .

so its possible for features to be aded in the future and bugs to be worked out  .

there is already an update out , though i'm not sure what it fixes updated  .

on jun 6 , 2009  .

this phone is great i really love it  .

anyone who kind of liked the voyager will love this phone  .

best phone for the price on verizon  .

get it .

i cannot even tell you how awesome this phone is  .

it is even better in person  .

the review video only gives a glimpse of its sweetness  .

do not hesitate to get this phone  .

you will not regret it .

if this phone did not have the internal qwerty keyboard with all of its features , it would still be the best phone available from verizon at the moment  .

exceptionally fast , and easy to use after some exploration  .

this phone will probably replace my ipod as my main music player thanks to the 3  .

5mm headphone jack  .

when taking pictures , it feels like you are using an actual camera  .

this phone essentially has everything anyone would ever want in a phone except for maybe wifi and apps  .

like the ones built for the iphone  .

my opinion , this is the best phone available in the us  .

period .

the lg env touch , voyager 2 , is a great follow up to the orginal lg vx10000 voyager  .

the touch is the closest to a smart phone as you can get  .

i absolutely love this phone  .

the price is affordable at $149  .

99 after mail    in rebate for a 2 year contract  .

this phone is pretty close to the iphone .

i just got my lg env touch in the mail 5    29    2009  .

i is elegible for my upgrade , and i wanted this phone , but i knew the release date was not until june 5th  .

when i called customer service i asked if they had inventory on this phone and if it could be ordered  .

and of course the answer is yes  .

the phone is awesome  .

i really like the music player  .

the ui is pretty fun  .

i had the lg voyager before this , and the env touch seems like it's made out of more sturdier materials  .

the pricing is $409  .

99 retail and $219  .

99    a $70 mail in rebate with a new 2 year contract which brings the price down to $149  .

i still need to play around with the phone a little more , but i must say this is an awesome phone  .

i got lucky and is able to get this phone a week ago    two weeks before its official release date of june 5th  .

my curiousity is peaked by searching for new verizon phones on the internet , and once i heard word of people being able to order this phone early , i jumped on the train  .

i is and still am 100% confident in purchasing this phone    it's amazing  .

for the past week i have been in absolute awe of this phone over its predecessor the lg voyager  .

the touch screen is much more improved , the size of the phone is more compact , and every little nook and cranny that is a downfall on the lg voyager has been eliminated from this phone  .

i am in love with this device as it meets my needs of text messages , mobile im , having a good sound    quality when talking on the phone , and having a long battery life  .

my one and only thing that i wish verizon would fix in future software updates is to pleeeeease raise the limit for how many text messages can be in the inbox and outbox  .

it seems silly to have a phone built for text messaging that does not have a big enough inbox/outbox storage  .

all in all though i am very pleased with this phone , and this is the best in the verizon lg line thus far  .

and for a killer price of $149  .

99 after rebate (only $20 more than the price of the lg env3) why not take the plunge and go for a touchscreen phone with a qwerty  .

it's definitely worth it  .

hey guys i got this phone about 2 weeks ago and so far its one of the best phones i've ever had  .

this is my first touchscreen phone so it took awhile to get used to  .

so far i've had no problems like other ppl have talked about like random shuting off , or the screen freezing  .

the only complaint i have is the battery life  .

i had a motorola razr b4 this and that razr basically went thru hell ( my mom accidentally ran over it in the end) but the battery life is better than this  .

i have to charge my phone like evryday or twice a day sometimes depending how much i text on it  .

like ill use it for like an hour or half an hour and the battery will go down like 2 bars other than that its really awesome phone , i would suggest getting a case or something for it  .

the camera rlly fun to use and i love how you can edit it and the smile detector thing the keyboard is soo awesome compared to what i had b4 which is a t9 keypad (soo annoying to use)  .

the screen is rlly responsive and vibrates when u touch it u can set it to long , short , or doubble i took mines off bc it wastes battery life  .

uhmm this phone is a great buy if u want a touchscrreen phone with a physical keyboard and if ur a heavy texter  .

this is great for texters and light data surfers disappointing no wi    fi and sometimes glitches but overall very good .

the qwerty keyboard is nicely spaced and i love the screen size and definition  .

like i said i totaly love the camera because the definition is amazing and u can take pics in b and w , negative , sepia , aqua and mch mch more  .

i also love the video camera and trust me its fun  .

i wish there is more battery life , i also find myself wishing the build is a bit bulkier , but then again thats jest me  .

i wish there is more display themes options but i dare say the menu fonts are pretty sweet .

overall this is a great phone i highly recommend it for its price  .

and i dnt really mind when i calls people when in my pocket (all phones do that) .

the env touch is a great all around phone for verizon wireless customers  .

it has a large 3 inch touch screen and a four row qwerty keyboard  .

its great for people who are into messaging and using verizon's vcast services  .

the phone may be a little bit blocky but considering how fast and smoothly it performs , this is easy to overlook  .

the touch screen is resistive so it won't be as resposive as an iphone but it works pretty well  .

if you do not want to pay for a smartphone data plan or just want to get a great phone than the lg env touch is an outstanding choice for verizon customers  .

i highly recommend this phone  .

have owned phone for three months , and it's surpassed my expectations  .

if you're looking for a smart phone , this is not it , but if you're not , this one has a lot to offer  .

i moved up from a vx8300 , and the only feature i miss from that phone is the option to resend a message with one command  .

you can do this with the touch , but it takes a few more steps (forward , contacts , select , send)  .

i particularly like the option of three keyboards when texting    a virtual phone keyboard on the touch screen when holding phone vertically , a touch qwerty when turning phone horizontally , and the physical qwerty when opening up the phone  .

you can switch back and forth between physical keyboard and touch screens in the middle of texting or other activities without having to start over , if one or the other option is easier for you .

after having a bad ordeal with the lg dare , i switched to this device i am highly satisfied with it , and i've been using it for about four months the only con about it is that the battery does not last very long if you frequently use the phone  .

if you like env's or want a touch screen phone , i suggest getting this phone .

an excellent phone for most any need and a great choice for those that can afford it  .

semi    sluggish controls at time keep it from a perfect score .

i just upgraded from the lg dare and i have to say i never have been so happy with a verizon phone got this phone from a friend for 160 about 2 weeks ago and fell in love lets start with messageing there are three ways to message 1 the full qwerty keyborad 2 the touch screen full qwerty or the standard 1    9 pad voice quilty is great battery life could b alot better but i guess it the two 3 in screens that take up most of it (in avg i get about 1 hour web , 3 hour talk and 60 texts )  .

youtube is great to look at one both screens  .

over all this is a great phone lg put lots of time and effort in this phone so if your thinking about a touch screen but still love the keypads this is the phone for u .

i have had this phone for about half a year now and i still love it  .

i is a teeny bit concerned about the battery life when i first bought it , from reviews here , but after owning it awhile the battery life is just fine    it only uses up battery badly when i leave the bluetooth on all day  .

the flip , the buttons , the touch screen are all really great  .

the accelerometer is really responsive which i love , because i've discovered that typing on the touch    screen qwerty keyboard is actually quite fast and easy , for short messages that don't need the tactile keyboard inside (which is also really nice) the buttons feel really high quality and the phone itself is always sleek , and doesn't attract fingerprints badly like some finishes do  .

the camera works really great which i love , because i can put an awesome picture of my dog on the home screen  .

the favorites for web pages and tools and programs works great and i use it all the time  .

i upgraded from an old    style flip phone with very limited capability , and i do not regret not getting an iphone  .

this one is just as good at what i use it for without the hefty hefty cost , so i consider it a win  .

in summary , this phone makes great use of all of the modern features found on cell phones today  .

not only did it exceed my expectations in all but one way , but it managed to make me forget that i is disappointed that verizon never got the iphone  .

the screens are fantastic , and the touchscreen is fun and easy to use  .

at last verizon has a serious competitor for the iphone .

super phone  .

when rumors and specs of the env touch began floating around , i didn't think it is much of an update from the voyager  .

however , after spending a considerable amount of time reading consistently good reviews , i decided to bequeath my titanium voyager to my little brother and upgrade to the env touch  .

i'm glad i did , because lg took an already good phone and made it great with improved features in a more refined package i believe that a phone , no matter how great the bells and whistles , should function well as a phone first and foremost  .

the touch has good call quality with very minimal background interference  .

i've yet to drop any calls  .

the speakerphone is loud and clear , though for the life of me i cannot understand why lg/verizon won't allow the speakerphone to be used with the flip closed  .

the internal speakers emit a clear , solid sound at just about any volume level as opposed to the voyager's tinny , crackly noise  .

ringer volume is acceptable , but it could stand to be a bit louder  .

vibrate is ok  .

ringtones and wallpaper are ok too , but i wound up sending myself ringers/wallpaper through myxer's online service texting on the internal keyboard is , as expected , wonderful  .

the layout of the keypad is more compact than the voyager's and the buttons are a tad smaller  .

this works well for me since my fingers are pretty small  .

the location of the centralized 'space bar' is not bad , but i still catch myself mistyping the 'b' and 'n' letters  .

more annoying however , is the lower placement of the 'sym' key , i'm constantly pressing the 'shift' key because that is where the 'sym' used to be on the voyager  .

no biggie though , it'll get easier as my fingers memorize the placement of the keys i use my phone for mostly calls and texting , so i cannot say anything about the quality of the mp3 player or verizon's vcast services  .

the touch has done away with mobile tv , but i doubt most of you used that anyway so no deal breaker there  .

web browsing is easy to use and the evdo rev    a speeds are fast enough  .

it could stand to use an updated browser but it's not a smartphone either so i won't complain  .

i've yet to use the document reader , but it will be very convenient should i need it in the future the 3  .

2 megapixel camera , with its schneider    kreuznach lens , is awesome  .

i don't feel like i'm losing out as much when i forget my camera at home  .

with enough light , even night photos (without flash) are great  .

i recently took some photos of the night show at the polynesian cultural center from up in the bleachers and they turned out really good  .

the flash can wash out your entire face if taken within 2 feet though  .

daytime indoor and outdoor photos are crisp and clear  .

video recordings are good too , though i haven't watched them on anything but the phone's screen the ui is a fancier version of verizon's standard interface  .

i would not mind learning an entirely new interface , but hey , that's verizon's fault not lg's  .

there's a tannish postage stamp theme and a blue , more icon    based theme  .

i prefer the blue theme , though i think both themes need to go  .

i mean , how is it that my old env2 had more themes  .

the touchscreen is great  .

scrolling has improved tremendously compared to the voyager  .

the phone does have an accelerometer , and it works well for viewing pictures and using the virtual qwerty  .

the drawing pad is a fun little addition in all , the env touch is an excellent replacement for the voyager  .

it's a worthy upgrade for voyager fans and for all you text    a    holics who cannot live without a full qwerty   ) the $99 pricepoint is great too  .

i docked half a star for its inability to use the speakerphone with the flip closed and for the lack of more/better themes  .

other than that , if you're looking for a great combination of the dare , env2/3 and voyager wrapped into one package this is it , go get one  .

awesome touch screen phone without the service issues of other networks  .

cough at t cough  touch screen is a must for me when navigating internet  .

i quickly adapted to the zoom in/out navigation of the online browsing which some other reviews had an issue with  .

if you plan on using the phone for more than a test run in the store , you should quickly adapt the touch screen and touch qwerty keyboard are actually so effective and well spaced on the large display (esp as compared to the new t    mobile google phone) i do not find myself using the physical qwerty keyboard as much as i thought i would all in all a great phone with an above average service provider  .

ultimately the only phone i might have bought over this one is the palm pre because of its innovative platform and multi tasking capabilities  .

however it is only available on sprint , the display is smaller , it is $100 more and the qwerty keyboard is cramped and rubbery  .

however , if you can wait , it is coming to verizon early next year bottom line   in the world of non    smart phones , this is my number one choice , hands down  .

other phones may do individual things better (camera , navigation , apps , etc) , but none pull them all together quite as well as the lg env touch .

overall , i'm extremely pleased with this phone  .

while not as fancy as an iphone (or costly)    and as a mac guy i would love to sync everything up , but for loathing at t    the env touch does everything i need and more  .

it's an excellent , well    crafted unit that should satisfy most people looking for a really good phone with most every feature one could want .

the lg env touch is one of the best verizon cell phones i've used  .

it's as close to a smart phone as you can get , and in some cases , much better read my pros and cons above for more info .

i have a tendency to buy tough , durable phones  .

my review might be a bit biased in that regard , but i hope that i'll provide information that should be useful for anyone who is considering this phone this phone has a mountain of potential and with the right applications and smart planning you can do much with it  .

the lg env touch has a large keyboard , two display screens that are gigantic for a phone of its size , and excellent reception  .

the external display is amazingly beautiful , and it can display can support 1  .

6 million colors  .

and that is absolutely insane , if you stop to think about it you can impress your friends by customizing the display with the wallpaper of your choice , which is not possible with the iphone  .

it may not possible to load this thing with the hundreds of applications that are available for the iphone , but i personally think that the smaller number of applications that are available for this phone are superior speaking of which , the document viewer for this phone is pretty good  .

i think that it's more convenient to use when it comes to reading documents from work than anything you'll find on the iphone  .

it is fast and it has a sharp resolution for that matter , the texting capabilities on this phone are pretty good  .

i'm able to log    in to just about anything that i would with a normal computer , and i can use the version of internet explorer that's included on this phone to do anything that i could with a smartphone or a normal computer  .

in that regard , it actually seems to be a lot faster than my friend's blackberry storm  .

i know that the youtube videos are definately a lot faster really , the only thing that's wrong with this phone is that the screen has a tendency to scratch and the battery life is absolutely horrible  .

it's understandable why the battery life is so bad , but it's still rather annoying to deal with .

the bottom line is this is a very good phone but i dont reccomend it for anyone over like 35 maby becuase most people 35 and over really dont use most of the features  .

also although the touch screen can be a little frustrating at first , once you get used to it , you find yourself just wanting to play on it cuase its fun to txt or take pics or even draw .

so advanced and yet no wi    fi  .

i mean , srsly verizon must be really desperate to go and monopolize its internet services and other apps but overall , its a very useful phone , the only thing it does not have is the slow    mo cam that the dare has , but oh well its still outweighs all other lg phones had a dare before , and it would keep getting an error with the cam , so after the 4th time this happened , a sales rep offered me the lg env touch as a replacement , i would only pay the difference if any [dare  $250 ; env touch $220]  .

this is an excellent upgrade for those of us that need to access email or the web while on the go but that don't need all of the features (nor the monthly cost) of a full    smartphone  .

the phone is a perfect compromise for those of us that need a large screen to read email or browse the web but want to keep it comfortably sized for voice calls what i like most   touch screen , qwerty keyboard , ability to hold a signal in a weak signal area (like where i live) , audio quality as good as any phone i had , ability to use as an mp3 player , and overall ease of operation what i like least   battery does not last more than a day with moderate use  .

it would be nice if verizon kept an extended battery in stock  .

the web browser is awkward to navigate  .

surely , both of these issues can be resolved with a software update .

the qwerty keyboard , the wonderful features , and the touch screen all make the env touch one of the best phones verizon's made in a long time  .

a wonderful sequel to the voyager .

the env touch is probably the best phone i've owned , and the best one i may own for a while  .

for one the screens are bigger and very clear  .

pictures taken on the 3  .

2 megapixel camera look crystal clear on either screen  .

videos are crisp and the sound is in sync with the video  .

the music player is much like an ipod , and lg has its own version of cover flow  .

you can listen to music and do just about everything else at the same time , including text  .

the touch screen is very good and responsive , and it vibrates every time you touch it , to verify that you've done something  .

the home screen on the front is very customizable , because you can add icons and move them around to anywhere on the screen , which is pretty cool  .

everything on this phone is near perfect , except for a couple flaws  .

the first major one is the battery life of the included battery  .

if you're a heavy texter (especially on the touch screen) , use the music player or use mobile web a lot , the battery will drain quickly  .

i highly recommend upgrading to the $50 extended battery  .

also , there are only 2 changeable themes on the env touch , which can be boring for some people  .

but other than these two flaws , this phone hits the spot .

overall , the phone is great  .

it's probably the best verizon phone out on the market , which basically means it's the best phone out on the american market  .

the touch screen is responsive , and it's quite beautiful , simply put  .

both external and internal screens have high resolutions that will make you gawk at the background on the internal screen for at least the first 5 minutes of having the phone  .

the camera is good , and is one of the best on verizon  .

the internet speed with verizon's ev    do 3g is very fast for a phone , and consistent  .

i have yet to see a place where i don't have enough reception go onto the internet  .

the browser is able to handle the more simple flash sites , and can at least show every website i have been on  .

both the on    screen and physical qwerty keyboards are very easy and comfortable to use , though you'll probably stick with the on    screen for the convenience and expedience (all the common used symbols ( ,  .

) are conveniently placed) in the end , the only problems with this phone are the mediocre battery life if you use the internet and such constantly (if you do not overuse the phone , it can last with a full battery for the whole day) , and the web browser's inconvenient browsing (at times you have to click links numerous times , etc)  .

overall , very nice phone , i'd recommend it to anyone , especially people who like phones and technology updated  .

on jul 12 , 2009  .

i switched from the krzr k1m fire (i know , i know) and i needed a phone that is good for texting  .

this phone answered my prayers  .

it is inexpensive and offered a lot of features that really impressed me  .

i'm just worried that i'm going to break it  .

haven't had this phone for very long , but coming from a treo 755 , the technology and ui is way better  .

love that it has an accelerometer and two super clear , high resoultion displays  .

only wish the inside screen is touch sensitive  .

the qwerty keyboard is great (hate phones without them) and the touchscreen is good too , with vibration feedback and like the iphone , the letters pop up when typing  .

overall , this phone is has a solid build and looks great  .

the ui is pretty good (huge upgrade from other verizon phones) although i wish there were more options for themes  .

have not dived into the apps yet that are available for this phone , so cannot comment on that , but the apps that come pre    installed are nice  .

i would highly recommend this phone and would say that it is possibly the best phone verizon has at the time of this review .

some great design choices in the interface make this phone fun to play with and functionally great  .

calls are clear and reception is good  .

love the favorites menu for accessing your most frequent contacts  .

love the full keyboard (it's my first keyboard phone and i make very few mistakes on the keys , they seem large enough) the only thing i don't like about the design choices for the phone is that you need to press essentially 3 keys to dial a speed dial number  .

you need to unlock the phone (if it's been in your pocket say) , then bring up the keypad , then you can dial away  .

i don't know how that might be changed but it can be a pain it took a little experimenting with video formats to find one that played  .

mp4 is supported by the phone using h  .

264 encoding but only the baseline profile  .

anything other than that wo not display though you may still get sound  .

i find about 512kbps video bitrate gives a good picture to file size ratio  .

i've put trailers on the phone as well as full movies and they all play great battery life is not good but that's mainly because i've played with it a lot since i've had it (video , audio , texting , etc  .

so , in conclusion , i love this phone despite it's little quirks  .

as the title says , they are definitely overlookable  .

the only upgrade to this phone would be to go with a full smartphone of some kind but then you need to pony up another $30 a month for a data plan and that's not worth it for me .

i'm the proud new owner of an lg env touch for 2 weeks  .

it's a great phone for personal and business use (ms outlook sync) , but i'm looking for practical apps (preferably free)  .

i'm not a tech geek , but once i get my hands on a gadget (pda , cellphone , digital watch , laptop , etc  .

) it does not take long for me to figure it out the env touch is easy  .

i still love the phone , but i'm bored  .

maybe i should have bought the samsung omnia  .

does anyone have any upgrade ideas  .

any practical apps  .

wallpapers  .

ringtones  .

http  //www  .

env    touch  .

com has a lot of information ryk007  .

i have been using this phone for about a month  .

i love it  .

yes , the touch screen and menu scrolling take some getting used to  .

i accidentally called my brother about seven times in a row until i figured out what i is doing wrong  .

it connects to my motorola bluetooth faster than my old motorola phone  .

the touchscreen number pad is great  .

the one touch dialing works well  .

i just love this phone  .

once again , there are some things that need to be figured out , but it was not very hard .

the phone is excellent , keyboard easy to lock and unlock (this is important) , calls are easy to answer , camera is excellent too       but why does it go from taking a photo directly to assuming that i want to send the photo in an email  .

i have to figure that out and change it , because that default is annoying  .

i appreciate the email and full browser access for $10/month (email only is $5) because data packages on blackberry's are much more  .

this is exactly what i wanted       not a continuous stream of emails but it's there when i need it  .

i honestly would prefer a flip phone , but this phone seems to offer more than the samsung alias , so think i'll keep it and be happy .

over all i love this phone but it has its little quarks , but what phone dosnt  .

this phone is one of the best but there should be another speaker on the back of the phone for the ringer and when the phone is closed for music  .

of all the phones listed in my summary the env touch stands just a little taller than even the offered smart phones and is vastly superior to the dumb phones in verizon's current lineup this phone is a great mix of the dare and the older voyager  .

it is not as thin as the dare and lacks the voyager's ability to view verizon television but the gains far outweigh the losses if you are on the fence with your next upgrade or purchase , take the advice of a certifiable phone junkie and go with the env touch  .

unless you need the smartphone capabilities you will not be disappointed small touches like the proximity sensor , threaded text messaging , great camera and having a physical keyboard may seem like fluff but try going without them in any of verizon's other phones and you'll be glad you purchased this phone , i know i am .

i like having a dual screen and having two 3 inch bright screens  .

i also like the idea of being able to use either the virtual or physical keyboard  .

this is my very first env and never realized that it has two speakers  .

that is outstanding  .

lol call and sound quality is superb  .

the design of the phone is very attractive (unlike the g1 lol) and felt like the phone is well built  .

i can continue on with this but i need to stop it here before i ran out of characters  .

overall , lg almost perfected a phone but still need improvements with it (missing features like wifi  .

) phone has an excellent signal  .

i work in the hospital and usually i do not get any services with t    mobile but with verizon wow they do have the largest network .

yes , overall i love this phone , and highly recommend it  .

the camera is amazing and feature    packed , texting on this phone is fantastic , and call quality is excellent  .

everything else on this phone is gravy , and you'll have fun playing with it all  .

caution   playing with the env touch will suck the battery life down like a hoover , however  .

do not play while you're out and about as you'll likely be without a phone in a couple of hours , unless you get the extended battery .

bottom line is that this is a great phone for people out there who would like a classy phone without paying the smartphone price  .

if you need decent web browsing and amazing txt messaging functionality this phone is better than the iphone but it lacks the iphone apps  .

the os is super fast and the network is super fast in wa area  .

at first i is disappointed with the web browser because i is unable to use google maps and gmail  .

i had a hell of a time getting those items to work but after 45min of playing around i got it to work  .

all other features on the phone work great and im amazed with the games this device supports  .

its like psp quality games  .

i felt the touch screen is sub par at first but i went into the browser settings and changed scroll speed to fast amazing differents note if you own this phone change the browser scroll to fast in the browser settings and you will be overjoyed with the performance it cooks not as accurate as the iphone thou  .

its hard to find fault with this phone hell its got a touch screen and it has a full keytxtpad and it offers the same functions if you dont wanna use the touch screen  .

there is a time and place for touch screen and a time for non touch screen and im loving the convenience of both  .

i love the touch screen background it gives you the option to create your favorite icons and place them where ever you want i cannot wait for themes to come out for this phone  .

they should add a feature to allow you to pivot the main screen to another  .

sorry for my rant injoy of the phone  .

this is an excellent phone  .

large responsive touch screen , browser , great calls , pictures , and music , and a lot more  .

the apps are awesome , and it's only $150 , that's a barging .

unfortunately , i have to mention the negative things first  .

on a hike in zion national park , the phone is destroyed  .

unbeknownst to me , the flip opened on my belt and got forced backwards totally destroying the lower pivot  .

do not keep this phone on your belt in a case that does not completely encase the phone in protection  .

it can be easily broken here  .

also get insurance on it , just in case  .

i now understand why most other phones use a slide out keyboard instead of one that flips open like a little laptop  .

the openwave browser is put simply , terrible  .

it will not open links with the touchscreen no matter how carefully you play with touchscreen settings  .

be advised that web surfing is only possible on websites that maintain a wap server , it is not a full internet access phone  .

the browser works erratically doing things you absolutely do not expect it to do frustrating  .

i experienced problems with vznavigator because in certain areas it cannot acquire a stable link to gps satellites orbiting in low earth orbit  .

this resulted in missing important turns several times  .

the voice command seems to have a problem understanding the word yes even after training curious  .

this having been said , there are some really good features that the phone has  .

the touchscreen has a lock you must slide up to access and thus doesn't pocket dial like so many other touchscreen phones seem to do  .

the side buttons are inset so they aren't activated by placing it in a fully surrounded case  .

the internal keyboard has the best layout i have ever seen and addresses some of the issues i had with my env2 phone in the past  .

it is big and very nice for those of us with fat fingertips  .

the text message button is indeed ingenious  .

bluetooth support is magnificent  .

you can get caller id announced to the headset if it has that capability , thus allowing you to not even look at the phone to know who is calling very nice  .

in addition , it has stereo bluetooth support and you can play music on it without wires hanging everywhere  .

you can also share files between other phones having the capability entirely over bluetooth  .

i tried this and it works excellently  .

of course you cannot have other bluetooth devices connected while you do this  .

both of the screens , the touchscreen on the outside and the internal screen are nice and large , very readable and bright well done  .

the internal flip has two speakers on the speakerphone part and plays music in stereo through these  .

the camera is a 3  .

2 megapixel and takes pretty good photographs and shoots good video too , although make sure you check settings on this first as these are low resolution by default  .

video files traded between other phones cannot be over a certain size or they will not transfer however  .

the phone has up to 16gb of microsd flash support , so you'll get a lot of music and pictures on this device  .

except for the delicacy of the flip pivots which appear to be strong but aren't , this phone has a lot to offer for those who do not want or need to pay extra for full internet access but i would recommend fussing over what case to carry it in to avoid problems with this relatively large flip phone  .

make sure you have insurance on it , that saved me from disaster  .

i wanted a cool smart phone but think the 30 dollar a month data charge is a complete scam  .

although the 9  .

95 data plan is a scam as well it is something i decided i could afford  .

i really like the layout of the phone and overall it should satisfy any text savvy person who desires a little something extra in their phone experience .

i just made the move from a plain cell phone  .

i wanted something for texting , a few other features  .

as someone who has resisted the mass movement to phones that do everything but make phone calls , i is hesitant to upgrade to new technology  .

(i don't like talking on the phone , so having a phone that does a bunch of other stuff has limited appeal to me  .

) this phone is so easy to use  .

the call quality is great , i really have not had to use the owner's manual (which is quite detailed) , and i'm very pleased with the physical unit itself  .

also , for my needs , the $9  .

99 data plan is plenty  .

having heard that verizon wireless is going to get the iphone , i'll probably make the leap  .

if your'e looking for something more that a cell phone , but less than a complete smart phone , i highly recommend the lg env touch  .

i would have rated this phone 5 stars if it was not for the battery/software glitch that happens every so often  .

i will be bringing mine in to verizon to have it looked over  .

hopefully the warranty will cover the phone if it is defective  .

oh , and it gets pretty hot with extended use , and i found letting it cool off and removing the battery before powering up again helps with this glitch .

i would def buy another one .

have had and enjoyed this phone for over 2 months now  .

after the first few weeks it started shutting down and back on again  .

i took it to the verizon store where i got it and she 'hard booted' it by taking the battery out while it is on and putting it back in  .

no more problems since then , except for a very occasional glitch or freeze but nothing major at all  .

when you use it alot for internet the battery does run down fairly quickly and i find myself charging it every night  .

but then , how hard is that  .

oh , and the durability amazing  .

it has been dropped about 5 times , with one of the drops being it fell out of a shallow pocket and fell down a full flight of stairs , hitting and bouncing off each one on the way down  .

i figured it is finished after that but no problem at all and speaking of pockets i have had no problems at all with it pocket dialing  .

you just have to make sure it is locked before you put it in your pocket overall , i recommend this phone to anyone  .

my brother    in law has the same one and he loves his too no problems updated  .

on may 24 , 2010  .

excellent design but internal issues  .

i have had issues with my phone glitching much like a tv would when the satellite signal is interrupted  .

screen would repeat or chop image , or lines would run vertical on screen  .

i'm on my third one in two weeks (my replacements were only refurbished of course)  .

and still the screen is sometimes a blank white , but i'm sick of switching phones and this minor issue is tolerable can be fixed by pushing any button  .

before on original phone i'd have to remove battery to reset  .

i love everything about this phone i just wish it would work properly  .

other than that , the touch is enjoyable to use  .

i really do love it .

i like the phone but my fiance lives out of town so we send daily pics and the camera doesnt take good pics so thats a bummer  .

and cant view pic as i am taking it bummer i have to charge th phone a couple of times a day thinking of buying a second battery  .

the phone is great for those who would like to surf the web fast and listen to music without having to pay for the extravagant cost of a smartphone  .

the camera could replace my digital camera , but indoor quality could be better  .

a great all    rounder  .

if you are buying this phone just because it has a touch screen , do not  .

the touch screen is not the best , and is just lame to buy the phone for that reason anyway .

i'm busy these days  .

the glory days of 1998 are over  .

you have to attack 24x7  .

i bought a droid cause my pam 755p is no longer supported and my new ever 2 thing is now  .

the droid has issues  .

i do not have time to work with a 1  .

0 product       sorry google  .

i love your stock , though  .

motorola , what's up  .

i thought ed would take care of that lame attempt at moto becoming a player in the telco market  .

now he's gone , so is sun , windows is believe it or not winning , and even my old love tandem is bought by a toy company       i mean compaq they took the science out of cs  .

should have gone into plumbing  .

yo , ya cannot out source a toilet  .

can ya  .

love ya'all and merry christmas ,  .

this is a great phone if you are a major texter , love music , and like to take pictures on your phone  .

i'm in love with it       i is pleasantly surprised , because it seemed like it is just going to be a fad phone  .

but this phone is incredible  .

the only problems are that the battery life could be better since it runs out fairly quickly , and whenever i open my phone to text using qwerty keyboard , it sometimes feel like plastic and could break if i barely press on it with all that sad , i would definitely recommend this phone to anyone  .

it's more a recreational phone than one for a buisnessman , but it has excellent features .

overall       this is a nice phone  .

this is a great phone for heavy texter but not for checking emails , surf the internet  .

i have one pet peeve about this phone the keypad  .

it does not always work for example if you happen to get a automatic teller that requires you to punch in number in order to direct your call else where it does not work  .

i even unlock the key on the side of the phone still does not work the voyager phone worked but not this one  .

next phone i will upgrade for either a blackberry or htc  .

had this phone since june and it is very hit and miss  .

there were several software issues that included   resetting itself to default settings when turned off , when set to word it still typed as if abc , some network issues (couldn't make calls when still showed service one one occasion) , touch screen is possessed (many mishits and shortcuts that would move around rather than activate function)  .

2 weeks ago i got firmware version 5 and it appears that these issues have been addressed and i am much happier camera takes great pics and it is fast and responsive  .

as a messager i do not think there is a better phone  .

verizon network and call quality are great  .

internet is ok with the touch screen , but i think it is even better inside the phone where there is an arrow that is moved with the d    pad , makes activating small links much easier  .

videos are good  .

very customizable as far as setting shortcuts to the touch screen and having tow internal pages for other shortcuts and media links  .

the small screen makes the internet difficult unless you have great eyes   fixed width makes the fonts very small , but normal view makes you scroll a lot  .

screen is not great for scrolling as it i sometimes get double hits or activate links overall i am happy enough to keep this until some of the kinks get ironed out of the driod or verizon gets and iphone  .

updated  .

on jul 6 , 2010  .

this is a good phone i do enjoy it  .

i is looking for a touch screen qwerty keyboard that wouldn't awaken if i accidentally touched the screen , draining the battery  .

this phone is great and others have written about the good stuff , so i wo not repeat i spoke with an lg tech rep today about the camera color issue  .

i've tweaked the settings some more and will take some pics outside tomorrow , but inside tonight the colors seem to be normal now  .

it is very annoying i'm a little hard of hearing , so all my sounds are set on high  .

the sounds come from the back when the phone is closed , so speaker phone is almost useless for me unless it's dead quiet .

previously i have had the env2  .

it kept breaking and not working (after you send a text , it did not show up in sent messages , half the screeen on the front went black , the ok and 987 buttons stopped working etc) and i have had it replaced three , that's right i said three , stinking times and i had had enough  .

i went into my verizon retailer and told them that i is tired of the phone breaking and asked when they sent the replacement , if i had to get the same phone or if there is another phone that is compatible with the charger cable  .

they said that the env touch would work with the cable , and that i could even use that same card  .

the very next day , fed    ex arrived with it and i had loved it ever since  .

like i said , there are only two cons to this amazing phone  .

much better than i ever imagined  .

it should really be a smartphone  .

very good device despite less than stellar touchscreen  .

i love the phone i had the blackberry storm and i hated it within the first week of owning it so i swapped it for the env touch and im happy about my decision although i wich it had a better browser and more than two themes  .

but the cons are trivial and barely take away from the overall great experience that comes from the env touch  .

i bought this primarily as a cell phone and would do it again  .

the voice quality is very good  .

here's where i confess that i am 67 , but do enjoy technology  .

however i will probably never text message and that's one good feature of the phone  .

i do email and it's easy to do on the touch  .

it's easy to navigate and have used the contacts list , calendar and tip calculator which are all available on cheaper phones  .

but i also have used the camera and video features and they are quite good for a cell phone  .

i have a 13 macbook , so there are interface problems but then i knew that going in and don't care  .

i have signed up for the email service and vcast stuff to try it for a month  .

but will probably discontinue that service and only get it for travel  .

i can still use the services , but would elect to be charged individually for the infrequent times i would use them  .

i do almost all my computer stuff on my laptop  .

(lucky me , i'm retired  .

i tried surfing the internet but bing , their search engine is very slow on the phone  .

there really was not any point to it  .

also once you get out of the vcast site for news , etc  .

the screen is hard to navigate in any readable way  .

once you increase the size of the print you cannot even get a full sentence to be contained on the screen  .

i thought i might use it to compare prices between a store and amazon or check user reviews  .

but navigating amazon on the phone is really slow and easy to end up somewhere else with the touch screen  .

i'll stick to my computer for web searches since i don't have a pc , i won't be using it for music either as i don't want to download songs for $2 apiece  .

if i had a pc , i could tansfer music to my phone  .

but then i do have an ipod the vcast news site etc  .

is pretty good  .

there they will fit the text to the screen so you can enlarge it enough to actually read  .

that's why i'd subscribe for a month if i'm traveling  .

although i haven't had much luck with vnavigator they've fixed the charger and now i have a cord adapter that's easy to use to charge my battery  .

so far battery life has been good  .

but then i do not use it all the time  .

if i'm not using it for a long time i just turn it completely off basically i bought the phone for its voice quality , keyboard , easy navigation , picture and video quality and the ability to hook up to vcast when i want to  .

and yes , i like the cool factor too  .

so far it's delivered on these very , very well .

definite need to increase the volume of the rintones , my lg env touch , though i love it has one major flaw , the speaker is on the inside and even with the phone volume turned as high as it allows , with phone in my pocket or purse it is barely audible , coupled with any exterior noise i cannot hear it at all  .

i have contacted verizon and they suggested i look for louder ringtones .

i have had this phone since july 12 and this is my first phone with a touch screen  .

i got to say , it's quite an amazing phone with amazing features  .

i heard that a lot of people have had problems with the battery life  .

i haven't had that problem yet  .

it's fun to play need for speed on it as all you need to do is tilt the phone all over the place  .

i also love the fact that it has a 3  .

5mm jack , meaning that i can listen to music through those headphones  .

i can even hear people talking through the headphones if i have an incoming call  .

even the sound quality on the phone is amazing now here comes the bad  .

on the first day i got it , the screen went blank  .

a week later , the whole phone wouldn't work  .

two weeks later , the screen would not touch and three days ago , the screen went blank when i tried to text  .

other than those minute    long average problems , i still love the phone and hope that it lasts me for a few years updated  .

on sep 26 , 2009  .

summary , battery life gets better , sound volume very bad  .

everything else i love  .

this phone is attractive and easy to use right out of the box .

i have been waiting patiently for my upgrade to this phone  .

i have had it for a week now and i have to say , it is truly an awesome phone  .

it is by far the best phone that is not a pda that verizon has on their line    up of phones i am very pleased with this phone  .

calibrating is very easy  .

camera takes great photos  .

i have a digitel camera too but this phone is equally as good as for features i wish it had the slide show like i had on my env2 as an internal wallpaper  .

also more display themes  .

i do like the various fonts you can select from the touch screen is very easy to use  .

i also like how you can have a qwerty keyboard if you don't want to use the touch form  .

both are great and i don't have problems with using the touch screen at all  .

i did not like the dare and is going to get the voyager , but then lg designed the touch and that is my choice  .

i am glad it is on the verizon network  .

i love this phone  .

you cannot go wrong with getting it updated  .

on sep 15 , 2009  .

i am never a cell phone fan but i am now .

overall very happy with the phone , would recommend it to anybody  .

this is a great phone and a worthy upgrade to anyone who has ever either had an voyager , or any other phone with a front touch screen  .

i like that this phone offers users either their choice of using the touchscreen or you can flip it open and  .

for blklacker how did you get google maps to work  .

i'd like to be able to find a location either on mapquest or goggle maps  .

also do you know if yahoo email is free on the env touch  .

i love the phone and its features  .

it is deservedly one of the highest rated handsets out there  .

however , it is astounding that certain free 3rd party web applications like google maps for mobile does not work  .

if a browser is advertised as full html it is fair to assume that you can access most everything the web has to offer  .

i believe access to these apps are unavailable so that verizon can continue to charge 9  .

99/month for apps like vznavigator  .

on sprint's palm pre on the other hand , there is even a shortcut for easy (free) access to google maps  .

these differences in carriers' policies toward free access are significant enough that they need to be mentioned in reviews of the phones themselves  .

it would have been nice to know before i got the env touch that i won't be able to access popular web tools like google maps and other google mobile products  .

who knows what else is out there that my full html browser cannot acces  .

in cnet's defence , i have not seen a single web review that mentions this significant limitation on verizon phones as opposed to those offered by other carries  .

which means    people do not know about it , which means there is no pressure on verizon to correct this and compete with the other carriers .

i previously owned the original v , then switched to the voyager  .

i am very diasppointed in the sound quality of this new env  .

i have the phone set to high and it is no comparison to the sound of the voyager with the exact same settings  .

i am missing calls because i cannot hear this phone ringing  .

lg couldn't tell me if there are different speakers being used on the env  .

verizon cannot give me an answer either so i may be switching back to my old voyager  .

cannot get the newer voyager because they tell me that it's being discontinued and replaced by the env touch and there none in stock  .

i'm very unhappy with the sound but the rest of the phone is great so if you have a little trouble hearing like me do not buy the env , if you have a voyager keep it  .
