Pros:. "Does" almost everything! It's become my netbook replacement (since my netbook broke) and does all I need it to do on the road... and I travel a LOT! On-screen keyboard very easy to use (my last nightmare of a phone was the BB Storm). 
Cons:. Battery Life. No front Facing Camera. Short USB/Charging Cord. Included browser can't handle more than one pop-up window and occasionally force closes, other browsers (that are better anyway like SkyFire) are available. Not an international phone. 
Summary:. This phone "does" everything I need it to. Flash, reads PDFs, email, photo, sharing/social media. The "cons" listed above are really all I can come up with. Texting/emailing is a breeze especially with Swype, phone is very intuitive (search for a restaurant, find hours and menus, then there's a button for directions - even navigation - to it) So many great apps out there and they ALL work on the X!. There will be bigger and better but for now this is the best! Plus with VZW network, I actually can use it everywhere I go! Great service!. I didn't necessarily want a physical keyboard (not a power-business user) and the on-screen keyboard is very easy and intuitive (came from a BB storm which was horrid). I do wish the battery lasted longer but I know it's a problem with all Android devices. I've found many ways to help conserve battery life and with moderate use, it lasts the entire day.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large, vibrant screen, very fast browser speeds, very customizable, great apps, excellent memory.. 
Cons:. Bubble correction for editing texts is hit or miss. Try to go back and menu pops up for cut, copy all, etc. minor issue, especially when most texts I receive don't bother to correct errors, so maybe just on me.. 
Summary:. This is a great smart phone that does everything well you would expect a smart phone to do. Was waiting for iphone to come to Verizon, but now I could care less if it happens or not based off the performance of this phone.. After months of research, I had decided on an Incredible, but when I got to the store and was using both I didn't think there was much of a comparison. While I was running them through their paces, 3 different people came by and said the X was the best phone they had ever owned as well. And what I thought was a drawback, the size, turned out to be a big asset. Very good for web browsing, plenty of space for keyboard, or viewing video, etc.. Very happy with Droid apps as I have an itouch and was apprehensive of losing all that funcionality , but I have all the cool apps I need.. Call quality is very good, no issues whether speakerphone or to the ear call.. Bottom line is this is an excellent phone and I'm very happy with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android apps, Ease of linking e-mail accounts, browser speed, 24 gb of memory, fantastic call quality, huge screen size.. 
Cons:. Short battery life with standard battery.. 
Summary:. I Love This Phone!!! Just get the extended life battery.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed and Antenna. Of all my friends i'm the only one who gets signal in our house even my roommates Incrd gets spotty reception, while I'm browsing solid 3G. I even get 3G in classes that are huge concrete dead zones.. 
Cons:. the buttons feel kind of flimsy and it feels strange having to push in a button and not the screen.The calender doesn't allow you to scheduled something on different non-consecutive days i.e. 10-11 Mon, Weds, &#38; Fri without entering each individually.. 
Summary:. Great phone it is everything a smartphone is suppose to be, a laptop in your pocket . . . with flash.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen !! VERY fast processor for a phone! excellent digital keyboard.Runs anything you throw at it. Great camera and HD video is good. I switched from a Blackberry Tour,btw.. Picked up the docking station and car kit,btw, outstanding !!!. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. After living with the BlackBerry Tour for two years and (very disappointed) Having had the Droid X for 2 weeks now and I am completely impressed with the X on every level. Was debating between the HTC Incredible,Droid X and the iphone 4. The screen size and sheer performance was the deciding factor for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love everything about it. love that you can text without typing! (voice) love the screen size ect. 
Cons:. price! heehee. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, slim, great battery life, Motoblur, now using Android 2.2, Flash support, HD video, rugged, much more.. 
Cons:. Some people may not like the size but it easily fits in a pocket.. 
Summary:. Motorola has outdone themselves again! Unfortuantely I am sure that this will only be the case for a few months unfortunately. This is my second Motorola Android phone. Moved from a Cliq to the Droid X. Motorola still makes some of the most reliable and sturdy phones on the market. This is a beautiful phone worth every penny. Although I am getting technology whiplash with the changes in the OS and the phone capabilities. I hope that it will slow down at some point. While the phone is on the larger side it still easily fits in a pocket especially given how slim it is. I love the bigger display for reading articles and books via the Kindle app. I also like the fact that it is not a monopolistic Apple product that forces you to put money in Jobs pocket. I encourage everyone to support the open platform approach endorsed by Google.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's a really nice phone, it's fast. 
Cons:. too big for my hand sometimes, it's definitely a man's phone.. 
Summary:. Hello all, New user to the android OS and I love the speed with my DX. Much faster than my storm! I had a heck of a time getting my phone since i'm stationed in Alaska. You know the whole ship to family in the lower 48, activate then ship to me! It was well worth the wait, I love droid x in terms of apps, widgets, security, everything else you can imagine. I want to share http://www.droidxforum.com it's really useful.. 

$$;
Pros:. Giant Screen - for those of us over 40, it's a real help! Love the 7 screens (moved from 3 with the original Droid till the upgrade of 2.2 which moved me to 5 screens). 
Cons:. MotoBlur is a bit quirky, I find my picture widget resizing itself on a regular basis for no apparent reason. Same old boring music player. Wish it had those dots on the home screen at the bottom like the Motorola Droid after the 2.2 update.. 
Summary:. Bottom line is that this phone ROCKS and I am very glad I updated. I was coming off the original Motorola Droid with the full Querty and I found that I never used it due to the D pad making it very hard to type on with small hands. The keyboard on the Droid X is terrific and I appreciate the screen space when I want to access and read a book from an app. My 11 year old is forever asking to play a game on it has a bigger screen then her Nintendo DSi. Now Android just needs to get a better handle on the Marketplace App (better organization, Itunes has you beat I'm afraid on this issue) but overall, I love the Android experience and the Verizon, Motorola Droid X ROCKS. Oh.. Verizon is awesome as well. I came from 15 years of Nextell and by comparison, Verizon is a solid 10 in every single area. You will not be disappointed in this phone, I don't see how that's even possible. Screen clarity is awesome!. Updated. on Sep 29, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. + Screen size. + Browser speed. + Ability to customize screens and icons. + Phone quality. + Battery life. 
Cons:. Physical buttons at bottom of screen. 
Summary:. I have had the Droid X for about a month now and I AM DIGGING IT ! The Froyo (2.2) update made this the slickest thing since goose sh*t. Syncs flawlessly with Outlook Exchange, great battery life, etc., etc. I can be very critical of things but I have only one dislike - the physical buttons at bottom of screen. With hindsight I would prefer the buttons be on the touch screen, but the HUGE screen size makes it worthwhile! After using the Droid X for a few weeks, I whipped out my iPhone 3GS and the iPhone screen felt TINY ! I am sold on Android.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast and fun .. 
Cons:. looks of it .. 

$$;
Pros:. Available apps. (lots of good browsers, games, special interest stuff) Speed. Large screen. LOTS of settings options on everything. SWYPE !!!! Control of battery usage. GPS (even works inside most houses). Integration with Google accounts.. 
Cons:. Sometimes takes more steps to accomplish something than on my Blackberry. Sometimes difficult to figureout how to DO a specific thing.. 
Summary:. Absolutely fantastic phone. Does everythig that I need it to do and then some. The thing that I use it for the LEAST is as a cell phone. Bottom line: It's a GREAT hand-held computer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not sure how this phone isn't in the editor's choice top 5 list. This is the total package especially now. that it's been updated to Froyo. Excellent.. 
Cons:. Overall, video quality and loading speed are great but periodically videos on Youtube can take longer to load but this could be caused by many different things.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely customizable you can make it what you want.. Great display. verizon. been with them years and never dropped a call once. 
Cons:. speaker is quiet.. ringer is quiet.. if you dont know how to use it you will kill your battery in hours. 
Summary:. you can make this do whatever you want however you want it. I have some of my homescreens set with apps like an Iphone, and others loaded out with widgets. the social networking integration is automatic and easy. call functionality is perfect they really nailed this part. merging calls, using web or apps while calling, turning on bluetooth while in call. you can do it all without much trouble.. the sound for the ringer is actually very quiet and I dont see this in many reviews. if you use your phone for an alarm then keep it very near you. apparently this has been noted by Motorola as well. they released a list of the loudest ringtones available and this really solved the issue. if you do not have an app killer installed the phone is basically worthless and you will kill the battery quickly. with an app killer all is well though.. on a side note this phone gets noticed every time it is out in the open. people want to see it and love the screen size.. and if you use your camera often then this is the phone for you regardless of all other features. the camera is a breeze.. the phone also has the antenna set up in a way so there is no loss of signal no matter how you hold it. this is one of the only smartphones that can boast this. now that I have this phone I have perfect signal no matter where I am. even places that held very little signal with my previous phones. that paired with the fact that the verion network is second to none ( you get what you pay for) means that I am 100% confident that I will have good signal when I pull my phone out.. swype is one of the best things about the phone and is truly the icing on the cake.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightning speed, easy to use and easy to get it out of the box and start using it. Small learning curve with big benefits. Apps are great and there are plenty in the market place and most are free. Internet is blistering fast.. 
Cons:. Has to be charged nightly.. 
Summary:. Big screen with big performance puts the DroidX to the forefront. As soon as it's in your hands you'll love the feel and as soon as you boot it up you'll love the performance. Motorola hit a Grand Slam with this one. You'll also love the Droid OS. ****HIGHLY RECOMENDED****. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge and clear LCD. I can use it for phone as well as game machine, eBook reader.. 
Cons:. Touch response is sluggish sometimes. 
Summary:. Best droid phone in the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful 4.3" screen. Fast 1GHz processor. 8GB of on board memory and a 16GB SD. This phone is by far the best Android phone in the world. 720p recording is awesome. Call and reception quality on Verizon's network is rivaled by none.. 
Cons:. Camera software not up to par with other high end Android phones (ie. HTC Evo). Motoblur is more like MotoBlah. Motorola's integration of corporate email syncing is buggy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, processor, Android, can be rooted now. 
Cons:. Wi-Fi tethering is pricey on Verizon. 
Summary:. Overall, strongly recommended. 

$$;
Pros:. nice big screen you might actually want to watch a movie on, customization options everywhere, HD picture and video you can share to xbox/ps3/computer/tv over wifi or watch on you tv via HDMI. free navigation. wifi hotspot (not free). long bat life... 
Cons:. you have to take your case off if you want to use the media dock/car mount. the bump on the back of the phone i could do without ( but not a big deal ). no front facing camera for those of you that would use video phone ( not me ). minor details.. 
Summary:. This is the better than my old droid phone in every way if you can deal without the qwerty keyboard. i didn't want to put it down. there are cool features on this phone that i didn't even expect and weren't advertised. too many things to list. you'll spend hours playing with it. Oh, and the preloaded NEED FOR SPEED trial game looks great and was a nice touch.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big display. Fast CPU. Very nice interface. Tons of widgets and apps. Best sounding phone I have owned. Picks up signals about anywhere. Can be adjusted to suit anyway I use it. Really nice build quality. Thin. Better than expected battery life.. 
Cons:. Alas, its greatest feature is its greatest drawback; its size. Buggy with aftermarket data cords (stick with Verizon/Motorola). Camera is tricky at times to master. Battery life could be better, but I was pleasantly surprised it is as good as it is.. 
Summary:. I have never had a smart phone before. They were too pricey and the data charges were too much. Well, some friends owned Droids and I began to get Droid envy. I had a Droid Incredible on order and the Droid X was announced a few days later. Well, I canceled my order and switched right away. I like the bigger screen, I preferred no physical keyboard (my preference). It has become indispensable to me now. I have access to about everything I struggled to keep at hand before. This bridges the gap I had between my laptop and a portable phone (that lacked most useful apps). I cannot imagine doing without it now. It is that good.. 

$$;
Pros:. The moto blur ui, screen, camera, camecorter, hard navigation keys, network, operating system. 
Cons:. Nothing except nothing. 
Summary:. It does every thing and it is on Verizon. 

$$;
Pros:. The touch screen is amazing, fast processor and (atleast for me) the service is amazing. The camera is also great, along with the video camcorder.. 
Cons:. The touch screen, although i almost never have any trouble with it, it does crap out sometimes when i enter my lock-slide-password. Also, a keyboard would have been good and an easy thing to tack on to the phone.. 
Summary:. Great touch screen, lacks a keyboard though, the camera and camcorder capabilities are amazing, but for now, without FroYo, it is a bit behind a bunch of other Android phones.. 

$$;
Pros:. Google integration; fast processor; sharp screen.. 
Cons:. Doesn't toast bread properly.. 
Summary:. Used to use a BlackBerry. Glad I switched to Android.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feel of quality; huge display, quick response, hotspot, free Google GPS; Verizon network. 
Cons:. Motoblur is a pain.. 
Summary:. Had this phone been shipped with a clean version of Froyo 2.2 and without the anti-ROM bootloader, it would have obsoleted every other Android phone on the market. As it is, it is still an outstanding phone, but with some quirks. I gave it a five. The screen is astounding in a way the EVO wasn't to me. I guess the aspect ratio makes it feel bigger.. 

$$;
Pros:. everything!. decided to try droid x and it was the best move for me. the os is great and is going to be only better. i love how you can move icons and customize your 7 different screens sweet! and love typing texts on a large keyborad. 
Cons:. would like speaker to be louder for music or if you are on speaker phone and have got to do something with battery life. its got to be better because when you start exploring this phone you will be playing with it and the battery will go quick.. 
Summary:. i dont like it i love it. it works! there it is plain and simple the iphone was a great example of what a smartpone should be and how it should do whats its suppose to. the droid x just stepped it a notch but to the point that the iphone will always play catch up. my apps work quickly there is no lag browser with dolphin i put on my phone and wow fast! cant wait for froyo to see some real speed. bottom line you want the biggest baddest smartphone with a carrier that is very good buy the droid x you will not be sorry. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredibly fast, excellent reception, multimedia features work great, typing is a breeze on this beast.. 
Cons:. if you use it alot, or use the navi at all plan to be plugged in, or running out of juice soon after. The battery isnt horrible, but the phone begs to be played with which exasperates the problem.. 
Summary:. I came from a BB curve, to a short stint with the Tilt 2 (last windows mobile adventure im ever going on, until windows phone 7,,, maybe.) And this phone just annihilates both of them in almost every way (I did love the speakerphone on the tilt 2). If you are looking for a touchscreen only phone, but have issues typing on almost any other phone out there, try this sucker out, I pretty close to as fast as hw keyboard, and if you like swype it gets better.. 

$$;
Pros:. It does everything. Seriously. Instead of the 1 or 2 bars I used to get I now almost always get max. That + processor = amazing inet speed. I rarely have page-loading delays. Ability to customize layout, installations, &#38; files.. 
Cons:. The only drawbacks are camera has a delay and learning the android interface requires a small learning curve if you're coming from an iPhone/iTouch background (as I was). The phone is relatively big, but that fades into the background very quickly.. 
Summary:. Fantastic. The baby of Win and Awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. BIG SCREEN. Picture quality 8 mp camera , 720p camcorder. Youtube video quality. 3g mobile Hotspot. WI-fi connectivity. Multi-tasking made easy. Solid build much more solid than regular droid. call quality Great 5 microphones used for noise cancelation. 
Cons:. Battery life ( you need a task manager ). Some apps you dont need easily deleted tho. NO MODS EFUSE LOOK IT UP you will brick this bad boy. DO not root this phone it does not make a good paper weight. 
Summary:. If you want a android phone that works great looks awesome sounds awesome and just does everything get this phone you will not be disappointed. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Fast, Great features, Hugh Screen. 
Cons:. If you leave the automatic brightness(default setting) on will suck up you battery life.. 
Summary:. I am loving this phone its awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. Display size theres no limit to what you can do with the 4.3'' display. The battery life is incredible for a phone this size, and features are limitless! Of course, as well as all that it OUTSOLD THE IPHONE!. 
Cons:. I can't really think of any big ones, sometimes space on the screen gets a little cluttered, but as do all phones.. 
Summary:. Why would you not want to play with the 4.3'' display, which looks crisp, and smooth? Now I can agree, for some people the 4.3'' is too much to handle. That's fine. Just don't order/buy it before you try it! Go to a local Verizon store first and see if its right for you! I'm tired of people buying this phone and complaining it?s too big for them. For me 4.3'' is the perfect size, not a tight fit in my jeans, yes you pretty much have to use 2 hands, but that?s fine with me considering 65% of the time I'm using it is mobile gaming. Don't let this phone fool you; just because it has a 4.3'' display, 512MB of ram, and a 1 GHz processor, this phone has impressive battery life! This phone with moderate usage can last about a day, or more. My 2 best friends, one owns a Droid Eris, the other an iPhone 3GS. This phone's battery lasts longer than both of them. Back to the display though, with 4.3?? what can you not do? Watching videos is more impressive than any other phone, and viewing photos that are so clear you feel that you?re right there! There are 4 physical buttons below the display, which some people prefer over touch sensitive, including me. The reason being, Is I like the actual click of pushing the buttons. I could go on all day about the positive things about this phone one of which, android software is backed by a multi-billion dollar company (Google), vs. the less rich Apple. Also Google doesn?t deny apps, unlike Apple, so app possibilities are limitless! But I must go, overall this phone is the best phone I?ve ever had/seen. And do me a favor, don?t buy this (or any) phone before you look at it, and try it out. Because everyone?s taste?s are different, and one phone does not fit all!. 

$$;
Pros:. big screen, fast processor, nice call quality, feels nice and good on hand, nice picture and video. it'll surely get better after froyo is released. 
Cons:. a bit sluggish camera, battery life is not one of the best.. 
Summary:. the product is awesome, liked it better than any other smartphones i've seen and used. recommend to anybody who's looking for a new smartphone. 

$$;
Pros:. Big beautiful screen, faster processor than the iPhone 4 and MUCH clearer phone reception. 
Cons:. It is a 10 out of 10. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright, massive 4.3 inch screen.. Highly customizable.. Silky smooth interface and browser (LauncherPro + Dolphin HD). Great phone quality.. Reliable service.. Fast 3G speeds.. Great daylight lens.. Potential with Froyo and 3.0 are through the roof.. 
Cons:. 8 MP camera could be a better.. Video quality and picture quality in the dark is sub-par.. 
Summary:. When comparing this phone to its closest rivals (Evo 4G and iPhone 4,) the Droid X can easily handle its own. This phone offers the fastest processor out of any phone in the market currently, and it truly shows when customizing the phone with LauncherPro. Silky smooth surfing between screens, and the ability to tailor-make the phone to your likings makes it a very appealing phone for techies and people who love to customize their electronics. But make no mistake, the phone is excellent for everyday app/internet/phone use. Most people will be surprised at just how good this phone is. Once android 2.2 is out for this phone, I truly think this will be the phone to beat.. 

$$;
Pros:. FAST, large screen GREAT for e-mails, great music player, FM radio works well, SWYPE is incredible, synchronization with GMail makes editing contacts a snap, amazingly accurate GPS, easy to find and use features/apps.. 
Cons:. Not completely bug free (but what electronic product is). Camera is slow to load, photo quality in dark is mediocre.. 
Summary:. I have had a blackberry in the past, and toyed with my friends IPhones. The Droid X is head and shoulders above both. I have never more than glanced at an Android phone before I bought it on launch day, and within a week I have it mastered. I can find, use every feature I want (most of which I didn't know existed at first). I have set it up to receive my work e-mail and the large screen makes it a pleasure to use for the tons of e-mails I get a day. The Swype keyboard makes replying to e-mails easier than on any phone with a physical keyboard that I have used. Loading songs from the computer was as easy as moving a file to an external harddrive. Surfing to my songs via WiFi and DLNA was easy too, and worked well, but it was much faster doing it hooked up with a wire. The rep at the Verizon store was unable to transfer my contacts, and I had limited time, so I connected to my GMail account (I had already ensured all of my contacts were completely filled out there) and I had my full contact list in seconds with phone numbers, email addresses, and everything. The google maps navigation looks better and is far more accurate than my factory Ford system or my TomTom. Latitudes is great, because my brothers work in different states and now we can all see where the others are each day (this makes for a good time when I leave the shop and they ask my why I am out slacking). There are more Apps than I will ever browse, and the free ones are all I need (for now). The network is fast in most places (I sometimes enter steel containers and the network slows when I am inside of them). Phone is clear and the actual telephone performance is better than my past phones (static, dropped calls rare as they may be, etc). I have encountered a problem with my bluetooth device not pairing if I turn bluetooth off on the phone with the toggle. It required me to turn the phone off/on. This happened twice. Easy fix, I don't turn bluetooth off. If I leave GPS on and Latitude up it sucks the battery pretty fast. Easy fix, don't stare at Latitude all day. As for battery life, except for the day that I was so fascinated with Latitude, it gets down to about 30% by evening with normal use (well, it is new, so maybe a little more than normal). This is fine, because I charge my phone every night anyway. I understand that all machines have limitations, but this phone is as close to perfect as I have seen any machine get (heck, my toaster doesn't always do what I want and it is a LOT simpler). I am an Android convert, and I am glad I waited for the Droid X.. 

$$;
Pros:. The sound quality for calls is excellent. Portability terrific: I can pop the phone into a cradle in the car and it acts just like a GPS system. Great apps available. I love this phone!. 
Cons:. Occasional lock-ups with some voice applications. (I'm still trying to figure out which these are.). 
Summary:. An excellent phone for the price--feature-rich, easy-to-use, and works well with the carrier (Verizonwireless).. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice, stylish, and very fast.. 
Cons:. None at all. 
Summary:. Great Phone. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Battery life is really good still gotta charge every nite though. 2.Screen is so big and colors are so rich. 3.Call quality is superb. 4.The picture and music gallery wowed me. 
Cons:. 1. hd video could be better but other than that there are no other cons.. 
Summary:. This phone is pretty much everything i could ever want. i like checking my email a lot in the day and with this i can check it from wherever i want. its sorta like a computer but pocket sized. everyone says it bulges a little in the pocket and its true but its so unnoticeable. i love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Battery lasts all day+ for heavy users. blazing fast. 3G conectivity much faster then other 3g phones including the Evo when running on 3g. Hump makes it feel very secure in your hand along with ruberized plastic. Will have Android 2.2 in a few weeks. 
Cons:. No kickstand. No front facing camera (Video chat on phones is still novel at best, so not so much of a con). 
Summary:. This is my first Android phone. I was holding out to see what Microsoft was going to come out with, but after trying a iPhone and an EVO at Best Buy, I knew I wanted an Android phone. The Droid X was perfect. The screen looks amazing. It's not a retina display, but good luck tying to spot individual pixels on this thing. Even at 4.3 inches everything looks detailed and smooth. Even zoomed way out on websites with the fonts really tiny you can still read the site if your eyes are good enough to see text that small. The display can easily be seen in direct sunlight after it adjusts to in which takes about 1-2 seconds after exposure to sunlight. I cant believe how fast this thing is. I found the experiance to be faster and smoother then the iPhone 4 I tested, and when Android 2.2 comes in in a few weeks it is going to be 5 times faster which is actually hard to believe that it could be any faster. The notifications feature is very good. A quick swipe down from the top of the screen will show you notifications such as emails, text messages, app downloads, system updates, and many other things. It also has an indicator light that will flash green when you have new messages waiting and your phone is in sleep mode. It also makes a very good flashlight in a pinch with the dual leds on it. The market has plenty of offerings for people wanting to pick up additional games and applications, but make no mistake, the phone has a great array of applications built in and waiting upon turning it on for the first time. I find myself picking up this phone when I would have picked up my laptop in the past because it is so fast and easy to perform different functions on the 4.3 inch screen. If you want function over form in a package that still looks amazing, this is the phone for you. It is a work horse that can get the job done while still looking great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large, vibrant, responsive screen. Email set up simple, easy - Like falling off a bike. Keyboard is exceptional - big screen = big keys and roomy keyboard. Web browsing is quick - rendered the full cnet page in no time. Customization - 7 home screens. 
Cons:. Battery life. Hardware buttons on face a bit small. 
Summary:. This phone is absolutely exceptional. Motorola really hit a home run with this device. Droid X is such an improvement from the Droid.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast and costoimizible. 
Cons:. big on yoyr hand. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast. Big. Fits in my pockets well. (surprisingly). Android. 
Cons:. Some features alil buggy like Facebook and twitter, but i like the concept. When they fix it it will be fantastic.. 
Summary:. This is the best phone I have ever owned. Its not about iphone killing for me but just a great phone. I am more of an android guy but some may be more for apple or blackberry. If you want something great and stable... GET THIS PHONE.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, Screen, Size, Abilities. 
Cons:. I am having a hard time paying attention to anything else but my phone.. 
Summary:. This phone is awsome. Obviously I have only had it for a little over a day, but it blows every phone I have handled out of the water. The only phone that comes close is the iphone 4 because of the screen resolution, that said this screen is larger so you can see the pages better anyways. I also love swipe, it is very intuitive and easy to use. Another plus is that there are more free apps than are offered through itunes. I have not yet tried loading music on to it. Hope this helps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything!. 
Cons:. None that I can yet!. 
Summary:. If you are looking for a smart phone this is the one! I've had it since 8:00 .am. today and can't put it down!! I have great reception after trying phone after phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, Android 2.1, thin size and feels good in the hand. Excellent voice and call quality, easily customized, a joy to use and look at. This phone is a marvelous improvement over the original Droid.. 
Cons:. Not as intuitive as the iPhone. Voice call quality is slightly below that of iPhone.. 
Summary:. I like everything about this phone. From my own tests and experiments, I think the Droid Incredible has slight better call voice quality, but the X is very good, and much better than both the Incredible and the iPhone in terms of camera, video, and customization. I think the iPhone has, with this phone, really met its match.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing fast speed, great display, fits great in bigger hands. No problems with camera or video.. 
Cons:. No front facing camera.. 
Summary:. I would recomend to anyone. Haven't had time to figure out everything yet, but very impressed and glad I didn't get the iphone 4!. 

$$;
Pros:. swype keyboard and android. 
Cons:. none that i can think of. 

$$;
Pros:. Android OS, Verizon, 4.3" screen, great build quality, HDMI out, better processor then snapdragon, 720p recording, great call quality with 2 antennas, and 3 speakers!. 
Cons:. It doesn't have a front facing camera (not that I would use it) but some people may. I guess it is always better to have all features for bragging purposes.. 
Summary:. The bottom line is that this phone has all the top of the line hardware and software that you could want on a 3g phone plus Verizon so you can have reliable coverage..

Pros:. Verizon wireless.

$$;
Pros:. Everything.. this phone does absoultly everything i want/ need... and YES that means I DO NOT need a FRONT VIDEO CAMERA .. I mean seriously that is such a gimmick. I mean WHO wants to answer a video call when your on the crapper? lol .. NO Privacy!!. 
Cons:. that I can write a review for a phone that isn't even OUT yet. Only Con I can think of for this phone is that I won't get to buy those cool BUMPERS for my phone like the IPHONE 4 Users Have to for there faulty mechanics/design ROFL. 
Summary:. IPHONE is Dead.. ANDROID is here and let's be honest .. they SELL 100,000 android phones a day. YOU do the math. YEAH in a MONTH it comes out to a LOT more than the iphones .. it's a dying breed .. POLLS already taken.. MORE than 75% of the apple developers for the iphone have already stated they'll make softwere for android now. simply because it's a Much bigger market !!! can You blame them? Not to mention all the new developers going over to Android from Blackberry and windoes Mobile .. ANDROID RULES !!!. I mean seriously what kind of moron goes out and Stands in line to buy a phone that is FAULTY?? I mean WOW You gotta be either pretty dumb. or brainwashed to no end. What is wrong with people? have they totally lost there Minds? YOU KNOW something is faulty and crap 2 hours after it's released? YET YOU still stand there and have to have it? DROIDS are what you are. SO why didn't you just buy a DROID? ROFL . .. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features. Incredible screen. Video lives up to advertised. Fun phone...kicks Storm 2's tail. I really like the touch screen key entry.. 
Cons:. Need Otterbox to make "Commuter" series case for this quickly. It is NOT rugged. Battey life is not great but I am not yet proficient at managing all the "stuff" going on at once. I still love my IPOD Touch for music.. 
Summary:. As a combo package of fun while staying on an business exchange server, this is a a great product for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is huge!!!. The 8MP camera w/ 720p video. Froyo and move apps to SD. Internet is good. Call quality is very good even though it does sound a little muffled. Processor is very nice. Came from a 400mhz a month ago. 
Cons:. I'm not crazy about Motoblur. Much prefer HTC sense.. The size is great but may be too big for some.. Wish it didn't have the camera lip but it's ok. Screen isn't as beautiful as Galaxy S.. Apps on other carrier were free and some are paid on Verizion.. 
Summary:. The bottom line is that I have finally found a phone that I love and that I feels fits with me. It's big, powerful and looks great. I switched from T-mobile and paid $150.00 to get out of contract to get this phone and I do not regret it in the least bit. If you are looking for a phone that can do everything... as the commercial says, "Droid Does." Bravo Motorola.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast response to most commands, video and pix awesome. battery ok. 
Cons:. has frozen up 3 times in 3 months. My new insigna flat screen will not work with HDMI to droid. hard to save and edit email and attachments.. 
Summary:. If you have had a pda and were waiting for an all in one that dos it all, this is the one. It smokes past my HP 211 in ease of use. You won't look back!!. 

$$;
Pros:. I love everything about this. So much ill just list it; ANDROID, large screen, such a nice screen that doesn't smudge with your skin oil, thin, camera button on the side, 8mp camera.. 
Cons:. No front video chat cam, buttons on the bttm instead of touch sense, motorola sense UI is not that great. Battery life. (still lasts all day). 
Summary:. I love this phone! Comparing it only with the EVO, I have to give it to the EVO, but DroidX is not far behind WHATSOEVER (sorry iPhone.......) But it should get with the program and get that front facing cam. The camera is so awesome on this phone, no need for anything else. I love the camera button on the side, it makes my life so much easier. If your on VZW, get this phone. If your on Sprint- stay on sprint and get the EVO, if your on ATT and have an iPhone, well that sucks. If your thinking about getting any phone in VZW's current line up, then this is the phone for you!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great call quality, browse the net, lots of free productive apps.long battery life. It almost replaces my pc. 
Cons:. Would have liked a front facing camera for Skype. 
Summary:. I've had this phone for a few months now and am really pleased. Great apps. good functionality, large screen with great resolution and long battery life. My wife who is die hard Apple fan also wants to get a Droid when her contract renews in a few months. GPS, Internet radio, camera, video, voice to text, very nice call quality. Plays media with hd video. Lots of great apps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Now, for the Droid X: I love the large vibrant screen &#38; good sound quality. It is very lightweight compared to the iPhone. The touch screen is responsive, keyboard is easier to use because it has caps lock, which are not available on the iPhone.. 
Cons:. Fewer apps because of the cult of Apple, but there are more available free apps because Droid X allows freeware. It takes about a day to get over this fact, you realize that most of the apps on the iPhone were pretty useless time wasters anyways.. 
Summary:. The bottom line is that the Droid X is a better machine than the iPhone. It is faster, has a better screen, and more functionality. If you like a dumbed-down experience, get an iPhone. If you want more control, get a Droid. Yes, you too can switch! I am the only person I know who has done this, dare to be different.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android OS, 8MP phone, 16gb memory card (included), easy to use touch screen. 
Cons:. Standard battery - A phone of this caliber should automatically come with a better battery!. Came only with USB/wall charge combo..nothing else (Come on Moto/Verizon!). 
Summary:. This is my first Android phone and I love it. The apps are amazing. This phone is really good for those of use with large hands that struggle to use touch screens on those smaller phones. The camera is good. I was able to use the barcode scanner the other day ( on a bottle of wine) and saved $10 dollars by locating a better price! Speaker phone is very clear and conference calls are simple. Touch screen keyboard is very precise. Beware of the apps though. Too much of anything is not a good thing. I had the live background, nav and all the other bells and whistles and the battery ran down in less than 2 hours. My general complaint with all of these new phones (EVO, Iphone4, Droids, Incredible) is why bother with a standard battery? Just include the better battery!! Setting up contacts was a breeze and it was cool to see my Facebook and Gmail contacts recognized on my phone.. Bottom-line: A great phone and the apps make it even better. 

$$;
Pros:. no lagging after 2.2 and awesome camera and video capture. i was amazed by the the photos and videos and the camera isnt sluggish anymore after update. the screen size is perfect and it fits in my pocket. Battery life lasts all day and i use it ALOT. 
Cons:. motoblur is very nice but the widgets do look a bit too business-like, a bit ugly, but it works well so it's not really a big deal. and also, 3g mobile hotspot should be FREE!. 
Summary:. this smartphone is BEAST. i totally recommend it over the droid incredible, droid 2, iphone 4 and the Samsung fascinate. froyo made the pretty good phone AWESOME and i really like the swype texting feature. this phone also has really nice call quality and motorola is known for making durable cell phones. this phone fells expensive and it certainly doesnt have that cheap feeling. this is undoubtedly one of the best phones on the market of of right now. 

$$;
Pros:. Problem free use. I had the Motorola Droid that for me was terrible along with an iPhone (I liked the iPhone, but had problems with AT&#38;T). The X allows me the freedom on using a single cellphone.. 
Cons:. Nothing I can think of.. 
Summary:. I would highly recommend this product. I was not looking for an iPhone killer, just a Verizon phone that would allow me to check e-mail, utilize apps and not drop calls. The Droid X is all this and more! Size is not a problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size. Speed. Feel. Good battery life for a smartphone. It does everything you can expect out of a smartphone today and does it well.. 
Cons:. Most will be addressed when 2.2 is released, in particular Exchange support issues out there for non-standard installs (no SSL certificate) and certain WiFi security setting on routers/access-points can cause WiFi drops.. 
Summary:. Do not let anyone scare you off with the screen size. It is a personal preference that you have to try as it is actually its strongest asset. The Android market is improving weekly which is really its only shortcoming when comparing to a iphone, inferior selection currently. As far as the hardware if you like a easy to read (not talking for the blind, but just more enjoyable) allowing longer reading time with less eye strain (compared to the &lt;=3.7 inch options) and great video playback this is the Droid you are looking for. Having tasted Froyo (2.2) I will say the phone is a 4 star on 2.1 and a 4.5 star on 2.2 which is around the corner. Enjoy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen. Fast. Good reception. Good speaker phone. HD camera and mini-HD output? Whoa. Apps!. 
Cons:. Built in Motorola social networking is a bit "meh". Simple music player. Need to disable various features to save battery or it will be gone it a hurry. Camera is so-so. Hassle to set up email.. 
Summary:. As a newb to the smart phone scene, I'm loving this.. Cameras: HD camcorder feature is fun to play with, but the still camera is just so-so. You need to be very still when taking pictures and even then they can be a little grainy. Takes some getting used to, but I think my photos are acceptable for a built in camera phone.. Motorola has some built in social networking for FB, Twitter, etc. I thought it was just OK, and prefer the FB app.. I found the wi-fi and gps to work well. But you have to be really careful to turn them off when not in use or you will drain the battery in a hurry.. Love having it hooked up to my car for speaker phone, GPS directions, music, etc. Awesome all in one for autos IMO. I've had a couple people say that the clarity and volume of the speaker phone is good. I have it in a Motorola mount on the dash.. My biggest gripe was that it was a real pain to set up my work email. For whatever reason the outgoing server setting I normally use would not work, so I had to use the gmail outgoing server settings. At least it works, but it shouldn't have taken an hour, 10 trys and looking for online help. Might be a Verizon deficiency and not Motorola. I don't know how to tell who's to blame on this one.. But overall, I'm very pleased. Seems to do quite a lot for $200!. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge screen, very fast, great functionality, Love the Swype, lots of apps!. 
Cons:. Battery life, and it's a big phone...but still am very happy wtih the purchase!. 
Summary:. Totally recommend!! I switched from a BB Tour and it's like i've been asleep for ages and have just woken up!! This phone is amazing! SWYPE is fast and fun, easy to use, was a bit overwhelmed the first day or two, but got the hang of it quickly. FAST, GREAT email handling, excellent browsing...I LOVE THIS PHONE!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Some important things for me: bluetooth clarity through the head unit in my car is EXCELLENT so calls are clear (even in my convertible w top down) Also streams music great. Love the big buttons on CAR DOCK. Screen is beautiful.. 
Cons:. Not crazy about screen lock. Battery life...meh. Media player didn't pick up most of my music info other than artist and titles; no cover art even though it was there when I loaded it. 

$$;
Pros:. -beautiful screen. -android OS. -voice recognition. -GPS. -integration with Google. -just plain fun to play with. 
Cons:. -size of phone. -battery is somewhat poor but expected. -camera is a pain to click. -social networking synch. 
Summary:. I really like this phone having come from a Blackberry Curve. I was afraid i would miss the keyboard but that has not really been an issue. I am so glad to have a good browser (and yes I had Opera on the BB) and a useable and logical interface.. The phone synched well with my university, gmail and outlook account. My Outlook worked best using the web interface my company provides (corporate synch function) and after that it was perfect. My contacts and calendar stay up to date.. The social networking synch is a bit annoying as it melds the twitter and facebook info into your regular contact list. I preferred to remove the twitter info and use the twitter app instead so it did not place all the fools I am following on twitter in my contacts. That is a bit much. It does that with your facebook friends too, and while yes they are friends, they are 'Facebook Friends' and not necessarily folks you want to have to scroll through to call your wife or sister or buddy. Keep them separate.. While I appreciate the 7 customizable screens, it is a bit much. I could do with 5. And one of the most annoying things, somehitng that almost makes me want to send the phone back and cancel my contract, is the irremovable icons on the app listing. So, there is a blockbuster and some stupid racing game app icon that you can not delete or remove unless you mess with the settings like a hacker. Total bs!. All in all, I really like this phone, but may pay my $35 restocking fee and get the incredible because I find it a bit big for my pocket. Some may not, but I do. But darn I will miss the big screen... 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size, swype, video recorder, expandable memory, HDMI port. 
Cons:. A little heavy.. 
Summary:. I went into Verizon for the 2nd time to test the Droid X. The first time I really liked it. The second time I fell in love.. I'm 50 yrs. old and I have a difficult time reading text on my BB Curve. I like the curve but the browser is worthless. So is the camera. I watched 3 Youtube videos on the Droid X before testing it for the second time. I was very sceptical of the virtual keyboard (due to my bad experience with the BB Storm) and something called Swype.. With the Droid X, I can actually read the screen without glasses. The browser is awesome. I tried Swype and was very surprised how easy it is to use. Better than the physical keyboard on the Curve. I actually like the Blur(ish) home screens.. It was a big decion for me but I ordered one and there is a 2 week back order. Urrrgh!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, tons of cool apps, smooth interface, beautiful touch screen. 
Cons:. figuring out how to maximize battery life is a little annoying. 
Summary:. Ok, so I had a BB Storm for almost 2 years and it was a good and reliable phone. I wanted to get an android phone for a while because I use google based products all the time. It was a toss-up between the Incredible and the X but the X won out because of the larger screen. I just love all the apps on the phone and it seems like there's nothing it can't do. Internet browsing is a breeze and I love the voice commands. The OS is almost always smooth (just a few hiccups) and I generally like the motoblur UI. Adding widgets are great as well as the motion backgrounds. Typing on the phone is great because of the large screen. Writing long emails is no problem on this phone. Watching videos/movies on this thing is unequaled. I compared my phone with my friends iphone 4 and even with it's vaunted "retina display" the X kicked its butt. One of my favorite aspects of this phone is the gps/maps/navigation. It blows any experience I had with my BB Storm out of the water. The fact that this has a "car mode" makes it just as good as any standalone gps device. Of course, Verizon is an awesome network with great coverage and even better customer service. I've been with them for 10 years and have NEVER had any issues with them (I've lived in three different states during that time too).. My only real gripe about the phone is the battery. I'm sure it's as good as any other smartphone battery but it seems like it takes too much work in order to get the most out of it. The task killer is good but it doesn't drastically improve my phone's battery life. I wish moto made it easier to figure this out. I do have to say with all the apps, widgets, live backgrounds and ultimately the huge screen, it makes sense why the battery would be easy to drain. The iphone doesn't have these features and I know it's also a battery hog.. My advice to anyone looking for a great smartphone (especially android) is to go with this phone. When Froyo 2.2 comes out, this will be the definitive phone to have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speaking your text, Googles Navigation is amazing and free!! The apps for andriod market just keep coming in!!! Video playback is......WOW!!, DROPPED CALLS? 0, and the list goes on!!!!! The Google and Verizon / Motorola partnership..... Priceless!!!. 
Cons:. Battery Life.........., If you use the airplane mode or the Task Killer App when you are not using your phone or in sleep mode, this will help to improve the battery life!!! Also the switching between apps can be sometimes slow.. 

$$;
Pros:. + Big screen. + Fast sensitivity. + Nice keyboard. + Reception = nice. + Speedy internet. + USB charge/upload things.. + Good battery life. If you turn off a lot of the settings that connect to the internet and data, allows 1 charge/day.. + More. 
Cons:. - Wish FM Radio allows you to use speaker without having to plug in jack. (2.2 update?). - More like you have to be a bit careful, but if your cheek touches the screen in the middle of the call, the call ends since your cheek touched that button.. 
Summary:. Coming from an LG flip phone, this is my first smart phone and I'm pretty satisfied with it. I was prepared to charge a lot more than my flip phone, but was surprised how fast I adapated to being able to charge either once per day or frequently charge when I'm in contact with a computer. I love how I can quickly plug the phone into the computer and drag any files into the phone. I extremely love the MP3 player.. In terms of battery life, as I said above, turn off a lot of the programs that connect with the internet. I turn off my notifications and lower the screen settings to its minimum. Hence, it allows me to survive the entire day before having to charge the phone. I also turn the screen off right away if I'm not using it (along with the turn off screen within a few minutes automatic setting).. Youtube works most of the time. Sometimes, the network connection falls out but that's something I expect. It's no big deal to me. Only wish we can access the full site of Youtube rather than the mobile version. =___=. Looking forward to the Froyo 2.2 update in September. ^^;. Updated. on Aug 7, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, great camera with double LED flash, Sturdy feel. 
Cons:. Little big due to screen, no front camera.. 
Summary:. I traded in my iPhone because Apple offended me by brushing complaints aside. I went to my local Verizon store on the 14th to possibly get a droid incredible 3 minutes before they closed. I was impressed to find that the manager let us in and told me he would save a phone for me. When I finally got it i was so excited. Though it doesn't have all the abilities the iphone had it allows me to do what I want to do with it. I am enjoying the android os and all of the apps work well in portrait and in landscape. Unlike the iphone i can dock my droid landscape and everything feels right, music doesn't automatically go to that useless album view. Also, phone calls show the contact picture next to the call controls which is nice. i have yet to find anything the iPhone has that I miss on this phone, sure no front camera but for now I used it once just to say I did, novelty only for now. Also, contrary to apple's claim that the droid x also has antennae issues I only have one word "lies".. 

$$;
Pros:. Swype, beautiful, responsive screen, great processor speed, HDMI, solid camera / camcorder. 
Cons:. motoblur, bluetooth can be a bit sluggish, bloatware, no dedicated call button????. 
Summary:. I've never used the incredible, but regardless this phone has blown me away. Once the majority of the blur widgets are removed and you get past the loads of crap pre-installed on the device, the speed and capability of the phone are enough to sell almost anyone. The camera, though sometimes hit or miss, is capable of stunning photographs, and the screen rivals that of my laptop. 3G speeds are very impressive. With froyo this phone will be unstoppable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Voice Quality and Battery Life. 
Cons:. The Lock Bar. 
Summary:. RECEPTION:. First test; on an Inside Elevator, doors closed floor 8 (in a 20 story building). None of the phones were able to make a call. Calls initiated before entering the elevator were dropped (with both devices).. Second test; Underground Parking. Nokia dropped calls and was not able to initiate any calls. Droid X, calls not dropped but voice quality deteriorated.. Third test; a street downtown between tall buildings. While the Nokia was not able to initiate calls, the Droid X was able to do them even though the communication was interrupted.. Variables were minimized calling the same persons, representing the four main cell phone carriers; ATT, VZN, Sprint and T-Mobile. I am aware that this test is more of indicative of different Carrier coverage and signal strength than differences in the phones as such.. CALL QUALITY:. After each call (made or received) I told the person who I talked with that I have changed my phone and wanted his/her opinion if they heard me better, the same or worse than before. Half of them responded that voice quality was the same and half said that it was better. No one said that it was worst and the Nokia?s are well known for their good mike &#38; speakerphone. Worth mentioning that calls were made under multiple settings such as windy places, a noisy shopping center and also in the silence of my office. Perhaps, the key factor for the Droid?s performance it?s the multiple microphones it uses, one for cancelling environmental noise.. BATTERY LIFE:. Perhaps, the most important factor in my decision to keep or exchange the Droid X. Nokia phones have an excellent battery life and my E-71 was charged for an hour every other day or even every third day with regular use. Regular use for me is from five to ten short calls a day, checking e-mails and browsing the Internet a couple of times a day. Wi-Fi is always on receiving e-mails and Bluetooth always enabled with either headphones or even the car stereo.. The Droid X allows users many configurations regarding battery use and which applications features are on or off as well as how illuminated you want the screen. It becomes even more user customizable with third party applications but I decided to run the battery duration tests with the three settings that Moto offers. Worth reminding that on a device with such a big display, most of the battery will be used by it.. To conduct this test you just go into Settings/ Battery Manager/Battery Profile. There are three native options; Performance, Smart and Battery Saver Mode. The results with my ?regular use? were:. Performance: After overnight charging, using the Performance Setting (with the brightest display illumination) battery lasted an average of 28 hours.. Smart Mode: Same use after overnight charging, the battery lasted an average of 36 hours on three trials.. Battery Saver Mode: Similar use &#38; charge, battery is lasting over 40 hours with at least 50% of the charge left according to the device battery meter (with said setting). On this mode, the battery use by the Display shows only 29% compared with 34% use for the Cell Standby, 19% for Voice calls, 11% for Phone Idle and 9% for the Bluetooth. This mode allows you also to configure specific settings for Peak hours and Off-peak Hours as well as individual display brightness. I have not tried yet the phone over 40 hours without recharging, afraid that might have a dead phone at some time.. CONCLUSIONS:. I am aware that this initial review might be subjective, has variables outside my control but though of publishing it to help consumers that are not decided on what device to get in this revolutionary summer of new smartphones. It will be very useful if others can compare the Droid X with similar devices using the same carrier; VZN. As for my needs, the Droid X does fulfill the three main ones and seems that it is a keeper.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautifull large screen, very fast, easy to use, nice camera and video. 
Cons:. Poor battery life. 
Summary:. Excellent phone, well made, the phone quality is very good. Many people focus on features like camera, video, internet, etc. All of these features work very well but this is still a phone.. The phone quality of making and receiving calls is excellent. The only negative is battery life which is poor. In the near future Seidio Company will have a 3500mah extended battery available and this will solve the poor battery life with the motorola standard battery. I traded in my HTC Droid Incredible for the Droid X and i am very happy that i did that. In my opinion the Droid X is an excellent smartphone.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Sweet little Android that sets-up easy. -Big Clear Screen. -Plenty of apps with new ones daily.. -Excellent 3G and Wireless Speeds. -Good camera stills and movies. -Does it all. 
Cons:. -There is very little not to like- but preferences will make some people give negative reviews:. -it's too big (I waited for big). -it's too heavy (ditto). -t's not as good at ____ as... (user preference). -Verizon is moving to tiered Internet pricing. 
Summary:. Let iPhone fanatics call theirs a phone- this is a little computer that runs an operating system that isn't Windows or Mac. And it's the best non-Mac screen size and res for computing and video/photo functions. The first one that ever made phone web-surfing make any sense to me.. This phone &#38; it's Droid relatives mark the beginning of the rise of Android as THE portable open-source operating system and will be incorporated into and compatible with upcoming Chrome Operating System. Many Developers will write for Android from now on- not just for phones but for future personal computers too. This Droid and it relatives should make Microsoft wet its pants. Don't bet against Google on this one.. I LOVE this damned thing- I bought two more for my daughters and hope we all get grand-fathered in on unlimited Verizon Internet when they start metering your Internet access.. Not Perfect- but what is? It will take awhile for all of it's mysteries and glitches (and Andoid 2.2 in less than a month) reveal themselves. For now, the thing WORKS WELL as wireless computer, camera, and phone.. Highly recommended..

Pros:. Big enough for ole fella like me to see everything, easy to learn (but im a geek) great microphone, so so camera, once you setup emails and Facebook it automatically downloads your data, so its right there, FAST, FAST, FAST!!!. 
Cons:. camera must be braced to take a picture without it being blurred, but the camera isnt why i bought this phone anyway, camera quite working 2nd day, but Motorola pushed a fix so just update the system software if you are having this problem. 
Summary:. Finally a phone for old folks that need big letters/numbers etc 5* phone.

Pros:. data is fast... camera is awesome and while using internet radio u can still multi task.. 
Cons:. big... but so far i have no complain.... 
Summary:. been an iPhone 2G/3G/3Gs user 4 awhile then got d iPhone 4 but i sent it back cuz of d antenna issues... work in d military and d signal is great in d hospital. like i said cant complain 4 now.... 

$$;
Pros:. Speech to Text Emails, Navigation &#38; Websearches. Mini-HDMI to HDMI. Large, Colorful Sharp Display. Customizable. Highly Responsive Touch Screen. 720p HD video. 8 mp camera. Great on-screen keyboard/swype. Email account notifications. Wi-Fi Capable. 
Cons:. Some unattractive screens. 8 mp camera doesn?t take sharp pics. No voice recorder. 
Summary:. Right off - I do not have experience with any other smart phone with which to compare the Droid X. I have been waiting to make the switch from a basic LG cell phone to a smartphone, and the Droid X was the one to do it for me. I wanted the large, clean display, the higher mp camera and the HDMI capability, but I got so much more in the Droid X. I didn't even realize it had the voice to text for web searches, navigation and writing emails - saving time typing out website addresses, etc. And that feature has been incredibly accurate (and good for a chuckle when it?s not).. Before this I had never used an on-screen keyboard, but found both the traditional qwerty and the innovative Swype to be very easy to use with my large fingers, and there was hardly a learning curve involved.. I find it amazing that it seems to ?know? which hyperlink I want on a non-mobile webpage when many are right next to each other -- but it is very accurate.. Regarding the battery life, I haven't had it long enough to really make a judgement call. I do recommend that you keep it on the charger longer than you think may be required the first couple of times, after fully discharging the battery each time, as I believe it will help the battery's "memory" for holding a charge longer. Others may want to correct me if thistechnique is faulty. As others have posted, be sure to manually shut down apps you aren't readily using, as this can eat up your battery charge.. I'm not crazy about the computerized voice announcing my incoming calls - I would much prefer to tie my own recording of my contacts' names as I did with my old LG. Perhaps there is a way of doing this by recording an MP3 and transferring it. I just need to explore a little more. I do plan to create my own general ringtone in just this way.. It appears my camera is taking pics at 6 mps only, but none seem to be sharp enough. I installed a free P***shop app, and plan to use it to try and improve the results. Let's face it, you should carry a good camera with you if you want high quality shots -- this is just a cool feature - along with the video capability -- to have with you at all times.. Another tip - as you select different functions when you first get the Droid X, check out the menu screen for additional functions which can really expand the way you use it.. It's a dream to not have to consistently go to the internet to check for new mail in my various email accounts. The notification bar at the top is terrific - just a few seconds and I can access my new mail.. Some of the screens just look untechy/unattractive to me - such as the settings scroll page - but this is such a little gripe.. I'm not very tech savvy, but have found the UI of the Android OS quite intuitive and not frustrating to get the hang of.. My home page now has everything I want on it without using any of the other screens - though it's great that there's "room to grow" as I discover other uses/apps.. I carry a very, very small purse - and was afraid that the Droid X might be too heavy or bulky -- but it slid right in with no noticeable weight difference. I didn?t find the camera protrusion on the back to be any kind of a problem at all.. When using it as a phone, I do find the large, boxy shape to be somewhat uncomfortable, but it?s OK. I prefer to have the large graphic display for all of its many other uses.. I?m concerned about protecting the screen, and will be looking for tips on the best case for protection while still being able to use the device.. Like others - I just can't put it down. Love the Droid X.. 

$$;
Pros:. I really like the intuitiveness of the keyboard. I refer to it's ability to tell which number or letter I really am pressing under my fat fingers! The screen is absolutely amazing.. 
Cons:. For folks not willing to spend some time learning the phone it can be a little frustrating - but duh- you don't go buying a computer without expecting to spend some time learning features.. 
Summary:. Buy it. No issues. Also, buy the screen protectors and at least a shell for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen. Great Reception compared to my previous provider (AT&#38;T). Great selection of apps.. Great Multimedia functioning. Good Speed.... 
Cons:. The only thing that I've found annoying so far is the battery life.... Make sure to deactivate an tools or applications that you aren't using as they will quickly drain the battery. Put in sleep mode when not in use... Should increase battery life.... 
Summary:. Did alot of research on the internet prior to purchasing this phone, and the around 90% of all reviews I read came back with great things to say about this phone. Traded up this phone from a HTC hero. No major complaints found at this time, except as mentioned before: Battery Life.... 

$$;
Pros:. A powerhouse of everything mobile!. 
Cons:. - Battery can't keep up with your need to constantly fiddle with this thing.. - Choose the incredible or the iPhone if your hands are on the smaller side.. 
Summary:. I usually am the one reading the reviews to make my decisions and leave it at that, but I felt compelled to put it out there that this is without a doubt "the real deal," "the big boy," "the head honcho" of cell phones right now.. - Lightning Fast with the Ti processor. - Fantastic call quality. - Big beautiful screen. - Feels light, despite its size and fits nicely in your pocket (I suggest getting the glossy phone protector so you dont pull out a pocket sock everytime you answer your phone.). - Chalked full of endless app options. - Great touch sensitivity. - Roomy keyboard and perfect those with larger meat hooks.. - I was iffy about the Camera housing that bumps out of the bottom of the phone, but it actually makes the phone feel more comfortable to hold.. ::Bottom, Bottom Line::. It took the consumer reports denial of the iPhone and about 10 minutes of playing around with the DroidX to push me over the Iphone/droid fence that I've been walking along for the past year. I know that boasting one phone over the other is like discussing religion and politcs at the dinner table now a days, but if you are caught in the middle of the fire fight, do yourself a favor and nerd out with the droid for a while.. 

$$;
Pros:. Strong Signal. Large, vibrant screen. Snappy processor. Great Camera. High Level of customization. 
Cons:. Not the best looking phone i've seen. Software look can use some polishing. Lack of front facing camera. 
Summary:. I returned my lackluster iphone 4 and went to the droid x. Best decision i've ever made. There are plenty of great droid x reviews out there. So, i'll just give a straight up battle royal, showing all the benefits i've found in the droid x over the iphone 4 (because we know the comparison this summer will be inevetable). Droid X Iphone. -4.3 in. screen -3.5 in. screen. -8 MP Camera w/ dual flash -5 MP Camera w/ single flash. -3 microphones for noise cancellation -2 mics. and sound capture during video recording. -HDMI port for video and photo playback -No HDMI port. on your high def TV. -Removable Battery -Non Removable Battery. -Removable Memory- 8 GB internal with up - Non Removable Memory 16 or 32. to 32 GB Removable Memory.

$$;
Pros:. How do we even know, it hasn't come out yet.. 
Cons:. From what I have read, there are very few.. 
Summary:. This post is not meant to be a waste of time for you to read. I just felt it was necessary to reply to other's posts that are talking about the phone as if they have it and are already using it. It hasn't come out yet!. From the 4 or so different website reviews I've read, PC Mag, Cnet and others, there are positive's and negatives. I will be using it for internet, gmail, phone calls and maybe Facebook. For that, this phone should be perfect. Especially for the extras that come with it- 8MP camera, HD quality videos, etc.. One of the reviewers was right, it's a mini super computer that's also a cell phone. And with that in mind, it's an awesome little toy.. Thanks for everyone's reviews, good and bad. For those that will be pulling the trigger this Thursday, congratulations and best of luck. Keep in mind you will have to get in line in front of me, because there are no pre-orders.. I sincerely hope this turns out to be as good as I'm thinking it will.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful Display with a nice form factor that feels pretty thin. Many great features and a solid build from Motorola who we know can build a nice Android Device. The 8.0 MP camera with dual LED flash takes great pictures too! Index your life.. 
Cons:. Unfortunately there is no front facing camera. 
Summary:. The Basics: A beautiful high contrast 4.3? screen (854 x 480 resolution) that basically goes edge to edge with glass. A Mini USB and mini HDMI port so you can watch and play anything on your phone on your TV (provided it is DLNA ready). Definitely excited about this feature to quickly transfer and watch downloaded content without moving around my laptop. And of course we have Android 2.1 and soon enough 2.2. This phone will be quick, snappy, and nasty (yes we mean it in a good way) running on its modified Texas Instrument OMAP 1.0 GHz processor. It is about time an alternative to the Snapdragon was chosen.. Updated. on Jul 17, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. -great big screen. -speedy processor. -great camera. 
Cons:. -awkward lump on back where camera lives. 
Summary:. I've heard lots of complaints about the large size of this phone, but I had no issues with the pocketability and found the large screen to be more of a pro than a con.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen, great camera, fast processor.. 
Cons:. MUSIC PLAYER! Very slow once plugged in to a computer.. 
Summary:. Contrary to most reviewers I actually like motoblur. I love almost everything about this phone. My few gripes are that it gets a lot of slowdown once plugged in to a computer. So much so that I can not text or select anything with any accuracy. Not a big deal if you don't plug into your computer much. I don't, but still something worth noting. My biggest problem is the music player. It organizes songs by alphabetical order, not original album order. VERY annoying. Easy fix to this is just get a new media player from the market. I have also had more than enough frustrating experiences trying to sync my music with itunes and have tried various ways with no luck. The closest I have gotten is doubles of everything for some reason. I have decided to scrap the idea and just keep the ipod in my car for now.. Bottom line is that this is a great phone. I love the camera and with the editing software that can be found in the marketplace, you can create some very high quality pictures. I love the screen size and don't find it too bulky at all. The processor is fast and it handles multi-tasking well. If you're looking to replace the old ipod, you might have frustration in store for you, but everything else is great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great weight, fits perfect in , easy to operate and navigate through menu's love all the features except One!. 
Cons:. Zoomless in the Camcorder a Big Disapointment for $375.00 I paid at Verizon. Sprint Evo 3G Includes Zoom in the Still Picture and Camcorder they downgrade the Lence from 8 megiplex to 5.0 on still and camcorder. 
Summary:. Offer the Zoomless feature fixable in software Upgrade or Android on line apps to access it free to fix zoomless. and keep alot of happy Motorola users of DROID-X more pleased than zoomless camcorder disappointed. 

$$;
Pros:. what i like in droid x screen size and fast browser , android os ,lot of free app, specially i like flash player 10.1, lot more,,,,. 
Cons:. what i don,t in droid x camara ,. 

$$;
Pros:. I've found it to have good voice phone quality. Great screen, large, bright and responsive. Appears to have solid build quality. Fast processing speed and plenty of apps for operating system. Supplied SD card has ample capacity for me.. 
Cons:. Large size which can be a benefit, is a minor problem when you put it in your pocket.. 
Summary:. The device has several different home screens so I set up each one for a different purpose. It linked quickly and easily with my Verizon email account. I have connected the phone to several Bluetooth devices. Pairing was very easy, and the phone has worked flawlessly when connected. I highly recommend this phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, big screen, great camera. This is my first android phone as it is probably for everyone else writing these reviews. but the software is fantastic, android is the greatest phone software iv had every other sofware for phones and this is the best. 
Cons:. ive had to replace it once already and i need to do it again. they just keep giving me broken phones. 
Summary:. love it, works great. i dont really call it a phone i call it an everything machine when you download apps into it that let it do everything. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent build quality from Motorola substantial in the hand, very responsive, no confusion glitches when switching from apps, works well with uploads to social sites, HD video quality, excellent camera, excellent intergration for corporate life.. 
Cons:. Slightly confusing when first using it, there is a learning curve, getting updates for it is a little confusing, whole new world that must be explored.. 
Summary:. Lets face it, we would all have I-Phones if they worked with Verizon. AT&#38;T Bad, Verizon Excellent. BUT, If you want your phone to work well and upload and download fast anywhere in the USA and have unlimited data then get the Droid X. If you don't care about making calls, and want to play around with apps buy the I-POD. If this is their real first attempt at toppling the giant I-Phone it is good and it will only get better.. 

$$;
Pros:. Battery Life better than EVO 4G. Camera Button. Customer Service and Network. Swype. Skype. Weight. 16 GB Sim Card. Banner Info Always on top. 
Cons:. Verizon is expensive. No Front face camera. No comtabile with 4G or LTE. Bad Sound Quality. VZ Navigator Extra Charge. Not easy to find phone contacts. No AutoFind when Searching for Application at Market. 
Summary:. I've been with Verizon for so many years, and they have great customer service.. I've always heard about how Sprint Customer Service not so good.. I've tested heavily Verizon Droid X and Sprint EVO 4G to decide which one to choose for me and my wife.. They are VERY Identical. But for me, Sprint EVO 4G Won (10-9).. Below are the major 19 factor that are different that I care about (everything else matches):. 1- Cost for 2 years (EVO wins). 2- Front Face Camera (EVO Wins). 3- Battery Life (DROID Wins). 4- Camera Button (DROID Wins). 5- Good Charger Location (EVO Wins). 6- Customer Service and Network (DROID Wins). 7- Zoom and Align Text when clicked (EVO Wins). 8- Swype (DROID Wins). 9- Skype (DROID Wins). 10- Weight (DROID Wins). 11- 4G Network (EVO Wins). 12- Sound Quality (EVO Wins). 13- Speed Test at Home (DROID Wins). 14- Speed Test at Work (EVO Wins). 15- 16 GB Sim Card (DROID Wins). 16- Sprint Navigator Free/VZ Navigator Extra Charge (EVO Wins). 17- Banner Info Always on top (DROID Wins). 18- Easy to find phone contacts (EVO Wins). 19- AutoFind when Searching for Application at Market (EVO Wins). I've been with Sprint since the beginning of this month and so far, Sprint Customer Service is very good, I also heard that they've improved the last two-three years.. Good luck with your decision making.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the large screen as have large hands. Multitasking of apps is great, i.e. Music, Navigation, phone calls, etc. The storage capacity is great. Apps for days... Works great with Rhapsody and my music.. 
Cons:. Some apps don't play nice with others. Not easy to switch sound and ringer profiles. Sometimes the GPS takes a while to sync up. Battery life is not as good as BB but what other smart phones is???. 
Summary:. I have had Windows and Blackberry smart phones and this one is hands down my favorite. Windows integrates best with Exchange as the mail client works like Outlook but that was really its asset. The BB is the best when it comes to business apps and phone calls related to battery life. You can't beat it but the interface is so plane and boring. The Droid X does not come with the best mail client but the droid market gives you better options.. I travel quite a bit so I have always had to carry my MP3 player and a phone. Going through airport security, I feared i would leave one of them or something else trying to keep up with the devices. Now I love that I have one device (that's not a proprietary brick) to keep up with after undressing for TSA. I no longer have to take yet a third device, my Garmin, as this will get me to unfamiliar destinations. And you can even mount it to the windshield with an optional car dock.. I have had a couple of calls come in while listening to music where the music that did not pause after answering. That has seemed to be isolated to just the Rhapsody app. The other media players seem to pause when I answer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast processor. Robust assortment of options accessible through settings or menu button. A back button. Large screen. GPS. 
Cons:. It locks up on me about once a day. I either have to shut the phone down and power back up; or if the phone won't let me shut it down, I pull the battery and restart. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.. 
Summary:. I'm not really into technical data, and I don't use a lot of features that this phone has to offer. I had an iphone 3G and it was really getting annoying. Not only was it getting agonizingly slow in loading web- pages. When resizing a page or scrolling, inevitably my finger would hit a link to another page, with no back button. The Droid X is way faster, and it seems to automatically size articles that I read online. So I am re-sizing less often. And it has a back button if I need it. I actually enjoy using my Droid X, as opposed to continually fighting with the iphone. I ordered the larger size battery, which is supposed to have twice the power. I've measured battery life through continual internet use; and find that the larger battery actually gives approximately a third more power. The GPS is way better than the iphone. Just like a real GPS that will re-route you, etc. It does have the nasty habit of locking up about once a day. When it locks up, basically nothing works. It could be playing music, but you can't stop it. Or you could be on the internet, or whatever. All of a sudden, the phone won't respond to anything. Restarting or pulling the battery fixes it. Maybe the thing is so complex that it just does this, or maybe I'm not clearing out cookies or whatever. I have the $7.99 a month insurance on the phone just in case. I'm a big guy. I like the large size of the phone and the large screen. I'll forgive the one flaw; like I say, maybe I'm not doing something. I use it pretty heavily, like a small laptop. It is a real workhorse.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of cool features, many free apps, any data you may possibly need is right at your fingertips and a killer cool gotta have this appeal.. 
Cons:. Battery life, Mine has locked up a few times, necessitating battery removal to reboot, charger cord is too short.. 
Summary:. For the latest in gadget cool, this is it, despite having to return my first one because of a speck of material in the lens, I have been pleased for the most part with the X. the horizon keyboard was welcomed and was the initial deciding factor as the vertical keyboard keys are too small for my fingers. If that were the only keyboard, the X would have to have gone back. And there definetly is not texting and driving with this bad boy...with its size &#38; the keyboard layout, it's a wreck just itching to happen if you try(please dont). There are tones of neat apps to play with and keep one busy...for FREE!!! Free is always good, and if you like you can donate or buy an app. I would like to see better holders/cases, like what is available for the iphone. Despite what reviewers say, I was diappointed by battery time and have to keep chargers with me at all time. I know you have to keep running apps to a minimum. I guess coming from more basic phones that have minimal battery drain, this was shocking. Charger cord needs to be longer as you will have it on the charger a lot. Make sure you get a screen protector for it as well...the name brand ones from Verizon are quite costly but you can get ones that are made for popular handheld game units, that fit just as well for much cheaper. You can also access your mail, social apps &#38; messengers all in one asy step as well.. All in all, I really love the X...it is the NEW crackberry to be sure!. 

$$;
Pros:. Integration: This device brings together mp3 player, phone, gps, email, social networking, and web all in one device. Before I had to carry at least my ipod and cellphone. It allows me to stay connected easily!. 
Cons:. Interface can be sluggish. For how "blazing fast" it's supposed to be it still is not as smooth as my ipod touch or the iphones I've played with. Battery life is pretty anemic if you want to use web. No direct Outlook 2010 integration. Data plan $$. 
Summary:. This is my first smartphone and I'm loving it! I'm a musician and have rhapsody so whatever I don't have on my sd card can be brought with me via rhapsody. As I get to use it more for a gps and camera I'm sure it will continue to grow on me. I definitely have insurance because the phone retails for around $600 at the time of this writing.. I had to wipe it and reload to allow connection to a second gmail account which is not a horrible thing (I was up and running again within 30 minutes), but I shouldn't have to do it again!. Overall the Droid X, in my mind, is a great iphone alternative. Especially for those of us who are not going to dump verizon for AT&#38;T and their signal dropping antics. I've dealt with Verizon customer support on several occasions and have been impressed by their professionalism and willingness to answer my questions.. I heartily recommend this phone to anyone who is looking at a smartphone. It does what it does well and the promised OS update as well as flash only make it an even more appealing option.. AKroschel.

$$;
Pros:. - Great sized screen.. - Fast processor.. - Very easy activation.. - Phone call quality great.. - Email/text messaging is great.. - Great for social media sites and web browsing.. - Overall usability is excellent!!!. 
Cons:. - The camera is just ok and I'm ok with that. Wouldn't personally use it for serious photography anyway.. - Although I LOVE the 4.3 sized screen, it begs for smudges and it's sometimes hard to see the screen sunlight.. 
Summary:. After being a Blackberry user for so many years, I finally got tired of just having a messaging device and needed something more multimedia driven. I was excited about the capabilities of the Droid X. I think this is a great phone so far and I would highly recommend it. I'm still checking out all of the features. Each discovery comes as a very welcomed surprise. It's really hard to find a cases and covers for this phone. HELLO!!! Wasn't the release date like announced in time to have these things available? Anyway, I give this phone 4/5 stars... :-).

Pros:. you can talk on the phone and surf the web and run apps. big screen. battery life , im lasting a day and a half to 2 days. calls quality. the hump makes this phone easier to hold. fast. customization. videos are amazing. swyp. texting. text to speech. 
Cons:. pictures are so so. camera hesitates to start and some times wont start at all. the phone keeps freezing mid screen. screen goes black from freezing and turns off. can be slow and sluggish at times and i mean slow. linking has screwed up my address book. 
Summary:. thsi phone is fast and powerfull when it works well i just got a bad apple seeing as my wifes works perfectly. im dissapointed by its issues with freezing and and it not being to proccess thing like voice activation with out turning off and frezing. and motorola needs to bring soem seriosu updates to refine the experience to the level of htc. its an amazing phone and if they just fine tune it, it will be the best thing out there hands down. i still love it even with the issues i am having deff buy over the incredible. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone is very fast, including access to webpages. The screen is clear and big. I like all of the apps that I have downloaded so far. Music even seems to sound better on the Droid X versus an iPod touch, using the same headphones.. 
Cons:. The battery doesn't seem to last too long. It has to be charged every night and I haven't really talked on it much yet. It's a little bulky to be exercising with if you want to completely replace using both your cell phone and an iPod.. 
Summary:. I really wish the battery was better. Other than that I love the phone. Hopefully once some Droid X specific armbands hit the market I will be able to totally ditch my iPod touch. (I actually like the C25K app better on the Android versus the IPod app). Using the Swype is going to take some getting used to, but I hear it's great once you get the hang of it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size. Screen quality. Call quality. Browser. 
Cons:. Battery life (is it ever good enough?). 
Summary:. I have come from a two year experience with a BlackBerry Curve. Unlike many smartphone users, I'm a businesses user with heavy email needs. The BlackBerry was fine for email, but weak on calendar and Internet and the apps are sadly lacking. I liked the BB keyboard, and was cautious about moving to a phone without one.. I have an iPad that I love. I had tried out the original Moto Droid, but the slide-out keyboard was useless with my big thumbs.. So far, the Droid X seems to be the perfect phone for me. The big screen size and excellent resolution are perfect for my aging eyes. The larger screen also helps makes the on-screen keyboard larger and easier to operate with large thumbs. Only the keyboard in landscape mode is usable for me. I do wish that the screen was a little brighter for outdoor use.(I couldn't use the Incredible at all in sunshine.). The overall large size of the phone isn't a problem.for me. The processor handles the screen and all processes beautifully.. I'm a professional photographer, so it's hard for me to praise any smartphone camera. The Droid X has one of the better ones, but it doesn't do as well as an average digital point-and-shoot. But, it's nice to have a camera of this quality with you at all times.. I think the battery will make it through a typical work day for me, but without much to spare. It charges very quickly, however.. Here's my analysis of Android 2.1: It isn't quite as polished as iOS on the iPhone. But it is much more customizable. If you think it's fun to tinker with the interface, you'll be able to build a phone that's really customized for your preferences and the way you use your phone. My me, it was worthwhile and enjoyable. So far, the Android Market is somewhat behind the Apple iTunes App store in both quality and quantity of apps, but it's improving quickly and many developers are flocking to this operating system.. Overall, I'm very happy I made this transition.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen=less eyestrain &#38; easier typing. Swype built in (easy text entry once you get used to it). Nice feel in hand, solid build. Dedicated camera button. 
Cons:. User Interface not as polished as HTC Sense. Software sometimes buggy. Slightly big for pocket. Screen not as responsive as Incredible. 
Summary:. I used an iPhone 3G, upgraded to the Incredible a little less than a month ago, then switched to the Droid X. All great phones. Here, I'll focus on the X vs. Incredible.. Short version: The Inc has a nicer screen for indoor use, and the software and user interface is more polished with more built-in features. The X has a more versatile screen and is obviously bigger. Otherwise, there is no clear choice between the two--you would have to make tradeoffs as outlined below:. User Interface: The X's UI is not as polished as the Inc's. But, this is a matter of personal preference (I prefer the look of the X widgets since they aren't as visually heavy, but they also aren't as functional). Some other UI/OS differences:. *The X phone dialer is not as nice--with the Inc., you can just dial the first few digits corresponding to a name in your address book.. *Voice control is easier on the X. Hold home then say a command (this makes up for the dialer). *No option to reduce ringer volume when picking up the phone as with Inc. Inc. has option to leave phone upside down on a desk--incoming calls will then cause one beep. With the X, turn the phone over to silence the ringer (but it rings if it's already face-down).. *The HTC mail widget is worth a separate mention: it allows you to easily scroll through messages without opening the mail app. I found it useful as a way to catch up between meetings. No such widget is on the X.. Look and Feel: The X isn't really as big as you might think. I am a big guy, and it is nice to find a phone that is the right size for me. Relative to the Incredible, I like that the camera lens doesn't protrude from the back, and that the phone feels thinner. It does fit better in my hand, and the big screen makes everything from typing to reading easier. Those with younger eyes and smaller fingers might prefer the opposite. The X seems to be made of plastic despite reports that it is made of metal, but it does feel solid.. Joystick: The Incredible has a joystick, the X doesn't. It was helpful when editing text--no need point my fat finger in between letters to insert, I could just scroll the joystick.. Keyboards: X comes the Swipe kb built-in, plus a multitouch version of the stock Android KB.No clear winner here (I'm sure you can eventually get Swipe for the Inc).. Browser: The Sense browser is nicer. It is smart about re-wrapping text when you zoom in and out, and double-tapping usually zooms in where you want. The X browser doesn't re-wrap the text as well, and you will often find yourself using horizontal scrolling. No cut-and-paste in the X browser as with the Inc. I think you can open more tabs, but I'd have to confirm this.. Android 2.2: It is worth mentioning that the X will (per Motorola) get the Android 2.2 update in August. The Droid Inc. will get it sometime before the end of the year (per HTC). 2.2 is rumored to increase speed, among other things. But neither phone has it NOW, so who knows.. Screen: The X has an LCD, no real surprises: it is passable in most light levels. The Incredible's AMOLED screen was wonderful under medium to low light (very good color contrast), but too washed out under bright light. Again, it is a trade off--do you prefer a great indoor screen, or a good all-purpose screen? (Note: the Inc IS usable under bright light, but barely).. Camera: The X has a dedicated physical camera button, making it quicker to open the camera and take a pic. However, the Incredible has tap-to-focus. The X does do 720p HD video recording and there is a noise cancelling mic for video recording. (Rumor: Inc will get 720p in a software update soon). Phone: The X's dialer isn't as feature rich (see above). I've made several test calls: on the Inc, the people I call reported that my voice was "tinny". The same people report great call quality with the X, perhaps because of the noise cancelling mic. (not present on the Inc). However, I found the earpiece speaker on the Inc. to be clearer and louder.. Reception: reception is good. Note that you can't compare reception by using the "bars"--you need to look at the db reading. On the inc, go to settings-&gt;about-&gt;network, on the X go to settings-&gt;about-&gt;status (better values are closer to zero). The X gets consistently better values than the Inc did in the same spots (but, that can vary from day-to-day, so this isn't conclusive). The X is getting a stronger signal than my dad's Moto Droid in side-by-side tests (~5dBm on average!), whereas the Moto Droid beat the Inc in side-by-side tests (about 2dBm on average). I don't know if this translates into any real-world benefit, and it could have more to do with my local conditions/towers. The speedtest.net app shows similar 3g bandwidth and Wifi bandwidth to the Inc. The X gets faster WiFi downloads than the Moto Droid in side-by-side tests (both seem to limit upload to about 2mbps).. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the Exchange support and the multimedia capabilities. provided.. 
Cons:. Not too many serious business or productivity software in the Droid market.. 
Summary:. At this point, CNET and other reviewers should review these devices as powerful, portable microcomputers that happen to have a phone attached to them. From all indications, this is a phone to get for all those users that consider themselves as "non-average Joes" users. I am considering it just for that. I had gotten the HTC EVO, but it turn out to be a sickly phone which I quickly returned and gave up on after my second one. Droidx, now we are talking..

Pros:. the screen was 23% larger than iphone. besides, flash support means i can watch videos and now most websites require flash, that's why safari sucks. even you have faster network on iphone, without flash, there's very little website you can go to.. 
Cons:. for me camera isn't a concern to me, if you want such a good camera, just get a digital camera for heaven sake! if not what is a digital camera for??? tell me!. 
Summary:. i want to watch all my videos on such a big screen and there is a app for android which allows me to read books too! though not that good yet books in your pocket and can be carried around? awesome.

Pros:. The screen is awesome. I like the resolution. It's easy to read web pages.. 
Cons:. There is a terrible lag with the home screen which I attribute to MotoBlur. The phone can be very slow and unresponsive sometimes. I've noticed the same thing on my friend's Droid X. It's also VERY difficult to type on the onscreen keyboard.. 
Summary:. Overall, I like the phone. I switched from a BlackBerry Tour and carried several Blackberry phones prior. The screen is beautiful. I like the openness of Android compared to the iPhone's iOS. I do carry an iPad which I love and it gives me my iOS fix.. There are only 3 real issues with the Droid X. First is the lag when going to the home screen. This drives me crazy and forces me to do things to refresh the screen. I blame this on MotoBlur which I am NOT a fan of. HTC's flavor of Android seems to run much smoother. Second, it is very difficult to type on the on screen keyboard which seems very unresponsive to me. Granted, I came from a physical keyboard but the iPhone's keyboard is much more responsive. I haven't typed on HTC's to amount to anything but it seems more responsive as well. Thirdly, I have issues with battery life. This, undoubtedly, is due at least in part to the 4.3" screen. After loading Advanced Task Killer the battery life improved considerably. However it still needs several drinks of juice throughout the day to stay charged. I would caution road warriors who fly a lot and are not near power outlets.. With a few tweaks this could be a great phone. I wish it was a world phone. I didn't realize this feature was missing when I bought it but that was my bad. I hear the Droid Pro is coming out later this year which should solve this problem. Overall, I don't wish I had my BlackBerry back but there are a few things on this phone that drive me crazy.. BTW, I loaded Sling Player on on the Droid X and it works VERY well!. Updated. on Aug 23, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Voice feature. Love the navigation no need for tom tom. Great browser speed.. 
Cons:. Battery life, social alerts missing (sure i set up sms alerts on fbook or email alert, i don't want 2 give fb my# &#38; i have enough emails) when on wifi, yahoo email cant authenticate. Solution been told switch 2 gmail. NO! Pulled the bat 2x in 2 wks. 
Summary:. I came from blackberry storm and i keep comparing. So all in all i like the phone. Im deciding if i can live without fb notifications, maybe its a blessing?!?! Battery issue, don't leave home wihout charger. I think it gives me more then my blackberry storm just wish it did the little things my berry did. Sigh!. If anyone comes across any fixes to my little issues email me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great fun to work with. Good call quality.. 
Cons:. Faulty screen issue. Now need to wait for a backorderd replacement.. 
Summary:. This phone seems great, but I worry about the quality of the product given that the screen failed in one week. Will the replacement work or is the screen quality a problem with Droid x?. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, screen size, SWYPE, camera extras (like slow mo and fast speed settings). 
Cons:. Stores TEXTS!!! And call logs. A little difficult to navigate at times. Not easy to set up. Not the greatest ring tone library.. 
Summary:. Well, I'm new to the smart phones. I just came off a Samsung Flip Shot, so this is all very new to me. I'm not very happy about how difficult it is to navigate through the settings. It seems a lot more complicated than on my basic phone. But most importantly I HATE the fact that even though I've erased text messages or calls logged into my recent call list, they remain in a contacts history list. I'm hoping the new update will fix this. Because other than that I'm loving the phone. Despite it's large size, I really do like it a lot. I was calling verizon this morning ready to exchange it for the fact that it holds a log of my history, but have been reading up on it and found out about an update. I'm also finding out about a lot of cool features I didn't know the phone had. IE: the camera settings in video mode. You can set it to fast or slow motion, since I have a 3 year old daughter. I'm sure those will come in handy for something funny. Crossing my fingers for the problem to be resolved, everything else I can live with.. O and as far as battery life.. yeah, not the greatest, but I'm sure it has a lot to do with the fact that it's hard to put the phone down.. I want to text everyone just so I can use swype. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE resolve the issue Verizon.. I got 28 days and counting lol. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge screen, USB drive access, decent ext. speaker volume, great music player, good interface, good picture/video FOR A PHONE, WIFI and bluetooth work very well, bright dual camera light, 7 home pages that you can customize.. 
Cons:. Unstable software, battery life, very bulky. 
Summary:. I have to admit, I've never been so excited about a new phone. That being said, I have always been skeptical about Motorola. I had an old flip phone from them, and also used a DVR from them for a number of years. They all share the same trait: unstable with frequent crashes.. Let's start with what I really like. I have 7 home pages that I can customize, short cuts and widgets make it very interesting. The internet access is quite fast. I notice little to no difference in speed between WIFI and 3G. There are TONS of apps to download, which are good and bad. They will be addressed more later. The phone has 3 microphones, one by your mouth, one on the top edge, and one on the rear. These are supposed to give you the best sound quality for videos and voice communication. The music player is pretty good; better than I'm used to having on a phone. I like iPod touch's interface better but it's good enough to not have to carry the iPod with you. Voice recognition on this phone is INSANELY good! I don't know if they have an amazing engine, or if the triple mics does the trick, but you can spit out some long thing like "Navigate to Water Street Brewery, Milwaukee, WI" and it will most often get it right and automatically open the navigation. You can also replace "navigate" with "call" (whether or not it's in your contacts list) or "look up) which will bring up Google search. That is really slick.. Now for what I don't like. The Droid X boasts a 1GHz processor, which evidently is still not enough. The phone seems to labor under all of its complexity even with all that power. Interestingly, it doesn't seem to matter whether you have motion backgrounds or just a solid picture. I frequently get some sort of error message that says the program has to shut down, which just happens over and over until I restart the whole phone. This happens even with the basic OS tools like camera, and menu options. The battery manager, for example, will do this a lot. Speaking of battery... I understand electronics, and what we're asking this to do, but given the size of the phone, and the increased depth at the top for the camera, they could have made the rest of it a few mm thicker to accommodate a larger battery (and not charge you $50 for the "extended" one). I haven't used the phone full on to see exactly how much on time it takes to kill the battery, but if you use the screen and apps a lot all day long, you will be down to 20% or less by bed time, or earlier. I would imagine that watching one full movie would basically kill the battery.. My deciding factor on this phone over the Droid 2 or HTC incredible was the 8.0MP/720p camera. That and the massive screen. I also have a 5 year old Sony Cybershot 7.2 MP camera and a Canon HF-20 1080i digital camcorder. The Droid X does not replace either of those, even with the higher megapixels. Higher MP doesn't mean anything if the sensor itself is crap. For a phone it takes passable pictures in good, even light. What's really annoying is that high contrast shots, like a lit up subject with a black background will have a light haze around it. Also, black areas in a picture or video will have a strange splotchy purple overtone, can't quite understand that.. Like I said before, the Android operating system is cool, and the Droid X is a great concept, but it has a lot of faults that you will have to get over if you really want the phone. I would recommend considering the HTC or Samsung equivalents before you let the camera sway you. It is a decent phone camera, but you won't be making prints from it. Verizon is kind of the carrier of choice for pilots like me because of their amazing coverage (I don't care what AT&#38;T says, if you go out into the very rural western US, you will be hurting). I would get the iPhone in a heartbeat over any Android if Verizon offered it. The apps for iPhone are much smoother and better made. Half the apps for android either don't work on certain phone models, or just seem thrown together. Ironically I'm not an Apple guy, but when it comes to the portable touch devices, nobody comes close in usability.. 

$$;
Pros:. touch screen, capabilities for wifi etc. I'm a small business user and there's a lot here to help me not be tethered to my laptop.. 
Cons:. I paid for this device and Verizon &#38; Motorola have locked me out! Tons of apps I don't want and can't easily remove (e.g. block busters, city id, amazon, etc) wanting $ and getting in the way! I will root asap. Avoid locked devices!!!. 
Summary:. They are selling into an entertainment market and not being supportive of business needs of knowledgeable users. Am tempted to go back to my Blackberry until I can get control of a device I "supposedly" own.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use interface with tons of useful applications.. 
Cons:. If you need reading glasses you may find the screen resolution lacking. Not easily able to increase font size and increasing brightness to highest level doesn't provide much help.. 
Summary:. Fine smart phone but I was forced to return to the Storm 1 due to inability to resolve screen resolution issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love quality of HD camera and the voice recognition.. 
Cons:. I am disappointed about the non-existing manual. Unless you pleed for one. I tried to return it but was convinced by the tech to give it more time. Even though she couldn't operate it. Im trying but still thinking about trading for the Incredible.. 
Summary:. Im confused.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of aps, pretty fast web access, great screen. 
Cons:. phone contact listing and access clunky, terrible basic battery (much improved with purchased extended life battery), too many freezes/crashes of software, camera button terrible (helped by 2.2 download).. 
Summary:. I have just exchanged for new unit because of loss of audible ring tones. Even with new battery, old phone losing power because of persistent live apps despite using app killer. This occurred after downloading 2.2. Waiting to see if replacement phone eliminates problem. If not, will get rid of Droid and take my chances elsewhere.. 

$$;
Pros:. The quality of the screen is top notch. Size and color display are great. Technically the phone should have great functionality. The sync capability with Google is very good.. 
Cons:. S-L-O-W response to touch, especially on text the 'X is slow to the point that if you are really moving, you find that you have to go back and correct. Phone quality is average at best (people complain far more often than I heard with Blackberry).. 
Summary:. Disappointing, especially given the initial hype. I am ready to return, and go seek the HTC. Some key missing capability includes the relatively poor implementation of spelling someone's name on a phone keypad (to dial). Data updates to contacts is not good. I recognize that the phone is packed with many features (or capacity for features), but first and foremost it most function very effectively in three key categories: phone, contact manager and calendar manager to be an effective tool. It is mediocre on all three (especially when compared to an iPhone).. The camera for its great megapixel count is horrible! Very disappointed in the camera (which is a key reason I went with Droid X). Frankly, if this phone was to be Verizon's iPhone killer, it falls far short of the goal. It's response both on bottom "hard" buttons and its screen buttons is relatively slow. How will this phone perform in a year or two, if it this slow now?. In summary, I think the software implementation lacks some real important capability (name spell on phone pad), and the chip speed is simply too slow for the function capacity. It is so poor, that I did not even load music to it, since I figured that would only exacerbate the performance issues.. BTW, I did turn off 3G and Wi-Fi, and I still found the performance slow.. 

$$;
Pros:. Apps are very good,downloading is very fast.. 
Cons:. It turn very while charging,batery life is very short.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice screen. Solid feel. Keyboard pretty good. Good apps (who needs 250,000). Call quality seems okay.. 
Cons:. Apps keep running and running and run the battery out. Not picking up good signal at home (wife also has verizon and her old LG has good reception). Micro USB - why not mini? Camera not so great. Too much to configure.. 
Summary:. Coming from an old BB Curve, and using an Apple iPod Touch, I figured this would be my all in one device. Unfortunately not the case.. I know apps are supposed to stay on and they don't drain the battery, but even with the option of battery saver on I ran through power pretty fast on relatively light use (60 minutes talk during the day, 1 text, no emails, downloaded a few apps, took 10 pictures and surfed the web/used a few apps for about 35 minutes, Pandora for 2 songs, FM radio just to try it) . I tried killing apps multiple ways but they keep coming back to life. Which by the way, why do I have to go to another program to close another one out? Just give me a red square with an X on it to close the program if I want.. While listening to Pandora, the radio which I turned on for 1 minute and then killed kept coming on so two songs playing at once.. Speech recognition was not very accurate, even after going through the exercise of setting it up to recognize my voice (which helped, but was not near perfect).. Complicated...this phone has so many settings and adjustments that can be made it is dizzying. I know it is more or less ready to go from the start, but once you start looking around there are too many options in the settings and other areas. Not simple like the iphone.. Clock on top had the correct time at 7:45pm, but clock app which shows larger time and date that I set on the home page showed 11:32 am???. I don't want to have to do it, but I think this one is going back. I will re-connect my blackberry until something better comes along, if I stay with Verizon (they better not try to charge me $35 restocking fee). Perhaps Windows 7? Will have to wait to see what that is about; otherwise wait for iPhone or just keep the ipod Touch in one pocket and blackberry in other (I need my outlook email/exchange for work at all times).. 

$$;
Pros:. Size of screen. Battery life. Swype keyboard. WiFi hotspot. HDMI output. 
Cons:. Horrible reliability (at least, for me). Frequent software freezes requiring reset. WiFi rarely connects and when it does, data transfer speeds are slooooow. Even 3G is slower on this phone :(. Clunky Motorola UI. 
Summary:. Let me start off by saying that I was very excited to get this phone. I lusted over it for days before its launch date on 07/15 and even plunked down $50 to reserve one at Best Buy so I wouldn't miss out. When the phone came in, I paid Best Buy's full retail price of $699. I'm a major phone geek and had owned four Android phones prior to this one (G1, Cliq, Nexus One and the Droid Incredible). I was very happy with my Incredible, but sold it to get this one.. My giddy anticipation turned sour within hours of getting the X. Being used to the HTC Sense UI, I didn't realize how much I liked it until I didn't have it anymore. It's very user friendly and in my opinion, greatly adds to the Android user experience. I felt the Motorola Blur UI and Motorola-specific widgets were clunky. I'm not being into the social networking scene, but I think there are way better widget choices for Facebook, Twitter, etc., in the market. What's worse, the Blur UI makes it so that any new firmware updates, such as Froyo, are delayed because it takes additional time to make Blur compatible with it. I probably speak for a lot of people when I say I'd much rather Froyo sooner than to have the supposed convenience of Blur. Blur also tends to be a resource hog, though you can minimize that by limiting how you use it.. Blur was the least of my concerns within about a day of having the phone. I soon realized there is a serious issue affecting a lot of X's where the phone will not connect reliably to a WiFi network. Even when it does connect, the data transfer speeds are awful. I read where not all the phones are affected with this problem, but a lot of them are, including the two that I tried.. And yes, I said I tried two X's. I returned the first one to Best Buy, figuring I just had a defective unit. It didn't help that the Verizon salesperson at Best Buy had very little technical knowledge and didn't seem to understand the difference between WiFi and 3G. She even had the gall to suggest I didn't need to use data that much anyway. So, anyway, I returned that phone and bought another at the Verizon store in the mall. I was relieved to find they still had one in stock and even better, it was about $140 cheaper than Best Buy. I was feeling good for a little while after leaving Verizon.. Yes, I said a little while. I soon discovered that this phone, too, had the exact same WiFi issue and even worse, the screen had a stuck pixel that quickly drove me mad. And before anyone tells me I should try this WiFi setting or that one, please understand that I tried EVERYTHING I could to get WiFi to work properly and reliably and nothing worked. Plus, a person shouldn't have to dink around with the settings each and every time they want to connect to WiFi. All my other Android phones (and every one of the other 15 or so WiFi enabled smart phones I've owned over the years) were able to connect with very little to no trouble, regardless of security type, B, G or N radio, etc.. Since WiFi didn't work for me, I was forced to use 3G. Normally, this would be no big deal, but 3G coverage at my house is non-existent (I have to use a Verizon network extender due to poor signal in the area). When I was in an area with good 3G, I noticed that both my X's were considerable slower than my other phones had been in the exact same areas. Using the Speedtest app, I observed data speeds to be around 20% slower overall. This was very irritating, considering how much I paid for the phone. I think I'd be even more upset if I was one of the people who were locked into a 2 yr contract when they got the phone.. I don't want to say every single thing about the phone was bad; it wasn't. I did like the bigger screen, the great battery life (for a smart phone), 3G hot spot capability, and the Swype keyboard. I fell in love with that, in fact. Once I got used to Swype, I wondered how I ever used a touch screen keyboard without it. The only problem with it was sometimes it was hard to drag my finger across the glass in a fluid motion, especially if my hands were dry. But that was just a minor annoyance and I really liked the keyboard overall. I hope it's more widely available soon.. So, in the end, I took the second phone back to Verizon and bought another Incredible. The Incredible wasn't perfect, but in my opinion, it was big steps above the X in a lot of areas. Plus, I like the OLED screen more that the TFT on the X. The OLED washes out more in bright light, but it's hard to beat in normal settings.. Sorry, Motorola, but it will be a long time before I try one of your products again after all the trouble I had with your X.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good large screen and decent voice to text translation, although they made a lot of aggravating decisions. Changes my swearing to ####, and like everything Droid related, you'll never figure it out without wasting a lot of time reading. 
Cons:. Awful as a phone. One example: someone texts you, and you want to call them. Takes 5-8 keyclicks, and you have to know which of 5 numbers is the cell that they texted from. It KNOWS the number, but you can't just press a button and call. Idiotic.. 
Summary:. You'll hate this thing quickly. The Sprint HTC EVO is also a droid, and is a better, smarter phone, but doesn't work well in Boston, where they don't have "4G Hotspot" or good coverage.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sized screen, Fast &#38; smooth. 
Cons:. Signal issues, poor call &#38; sound quality. Cant see the 4 lower keys on the bottom in low light. 
Summary:. I like Android Market but hate the phone &#38; service quality. I live close to 9 towers in Anaheim (i live 1 mile away from one) by Disneyland and the signal strength is so weak. I get 3 then two bars most of the time (sometimes 0) there are very few areas i get all 4 bars, either Verizon's service sucks or its the phone. I've had the htc incredible and returned for signal issues so this makes me think its either the phone or Verizon service or maybe even a flaw in Android OC. There can not be two phones by different manufactures with the same issues in an area saturated with towers. One of the three need to collaborate and figure out who is at fault because I will be posting youtube video proving all this showing the towers and map links and signal quality issues to prove all this real soon.. 

$$;
Pros:. -The voice navigation was decent for a phone.. -Android OS is not bad.. 
Cons:. -Burns through battery even with low usage.. -Slow recharge.. -One second or so lag on most calls.. -The video is grainy and of less overall quality than 3GS.. -No built-in sync to Outlook, Music, Calander, etc.. -Screen scratches very easily.. 
Summary:. I left Verizon when the iPhone 3GS came out since Verizon didn't have a smart phone at the time that was even remotely equivalent. The 3GS is an absolutely WONDERFUL phone but as most AT&#38;T customers know, the cell service is horrible. My immense frustration with AT&#38;T combined with the fact that Verizon now offered a phone that was supposed to be fairly equivalent to the iPhone finally motivated me to give the new DroidX a try.. I can't tell you how much I wanted to like the DroidX. I was just so ready to be done with AT&#38;T. Unfortunately the phone has disappointed me from day one. It started when I tried to sync my PC to my phone (contacts, calendar, music, etc). I'm fairly tech savvy person yet I couldn't find any easy intuitive way to sync. I eventually called Verizon and they recommended I buy a piece of $40 unsupported software that "should do the job". I thought they were joking at first, but they weren't. They said unless I was already using google for email and calendar that I would have to buy software (even then, music, videos, etc would have to be synced separately).. I eventually found what was a disappointing but acceptable solution to my syncing problem (not even close to as simple as iTunes). The next thing I noticed about the phone was how quickly it ran through the battery. Even before I had the DroidX I was curious how a phone with such a huge screen wouldn't eat through a battery. Silly me, Motorola apparently didn't think that far ahead when they designed it. I used to think the 3GS was bad in going through its charge before the end of a day. The DroidX's battery is often half dead by the end of the morning, with no more than a few calls and relatively low usage. It's a complete battery hog that makes the iPhone look like a conservation god in comparison. I tried playing with the settings to see if I had an app open or something else that might have been using battery but never found anything obvious. I kept the GPS toggle off most of the time because that seems to make it drop faster than anything, even when it's switched on but not in use.. Also, on the topic of the battery, it takes much longer to charge than the iPhone. Plugged into my PC via USB it barely charges at all over an hour, whereas my 3GS can almost completely replenish in that time.. The 8 MP camera in this phone was supposed to be great. I believe it's even one of the first major smart phones to have a mechanical shutter. The photos are ok at best and the HD video is a joke. The 3GS takes much clearer video overall. Again, a major disappointment.. Next, the screen scratches very easily. For those of you wondering why I didn't use a protector, it's because the iPhone never needed one and I figured the DroidX wouldn't either. With the DroidX, I looked down after a week and noticed it already had several scratches, yet after more than a year with the 3GS, it doesn't have any (on the screen). I've always been careful with my 3GS and I figured the DroidX would be no worse off with similar care. I was wrong.. Worst of all, the call quality on the DriodX was by far the worst of any phone I've ever had. Specifically, I've had a very difficult time hearing people on the other end (not due to volume). Their voices are usually muffled and there seems to be a half second to second delay on every single call. It's like watching the news when they have a commentator that is linked up via satellite and everything is lagging slightly. It makes conversations very difficult and annoying.. I called Verizon today to let them know I wanted to return the phone and asked them what I needed to do. Generally speaking, I've been very satisfied with Verizon customer service over the years (even though I had an iPhone with AT&#38;T, I kept two other lines with Verizon that I've had for years). My satisfaction with Verizon ended today when they said I would be charged a $35 restocking fee for returning the phone. All I've ever been told by Verizon was that if I didn't like the phone, I could return in within 30 days for a full money back return. Today they told me I have to pay them a $35 restocking fee to return a phone I can't stand. The fact that I've been a good paying customer for years didn't make one bit of difference to them. I'm considering pulling my other two lines from them now and going to Sprint.. With some refinement the DroidX could have been a good phone. Android and Motorola are on the right track but "almost there" is just not good enough. At least not when it means a extremely short battery life, a crappy camera, and poor call quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. Only good thing is that it has free music downloads. It also has some silly games/apps to DL for free or pay but those will lose your attention after 5 minutes, which is as long as the battery lasts anyway.. 
Cons:. 1. Battery Life. I have to bring my charger to work, in the car, and charge it before bed. each time charging it to 100% from 0%. Even when I barely use my phone and put the settings lows. 2. Terrible GPS. 3. Very very difficult to text on this. 
Summary:. This is the biggest waste of my time and money. The reviews are not exaggerating when they say the battery life blows. Unless you don't mind being a slave to a power outlet, don't make the same mystake I did. Stay away from this product it seriously sucks. 

$$;
Pros:. Droid X was fine. It was Customer Service I couldn't deal with. 
Cons:. Customer Service. 
Summary:. The sequence of events was:. 1. I called Verizon Wireless to ask when I needed to cancel to avoid getting charged for my laptop Mobile Broadband as well as the Droid X Mobile Broadband.. 2. The Customer Service rep said no matter when I cancelled, I would be refunded on a pro-rated basis. I had no problem with the early termination fee of $260.. 3. I activated my Droid X this morning, checked it out to make sure the 3G Hotspot worked with my laptop.. 4. I called Verizon Wireless this afternoon to decommission my laptop Mobile Broadband.. a. They said I was paid up until Sept 18.. b. They said there would be no refund. c. I reminded them I had called and the Customer Service rep said I would get a prorated refund. d. They said their "system" didn't allow that. e. I asked to speak to a supervisor. f. They said they were all in a meeting, and a supervisor would call me back. g. After waiting 2-3 hours, I called back and spoke to a supervisor. h. The supervisor kept apologizing, saying there was nothing he could do, but no refund. i. To get a refund, I would have had to cancel yesterday, not today.. j. I pointed out that Customer Service had given me incorrect information. k. He said, too bad, there was nothing he could do.. l. Supervisor kept apologizing. I said he should stop it, since he wasn't really sorry.. m. I deactivated the Droid X and am returning it to Verizon Wireless.. Another case of bureaucracy costing everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good reception, innovative feature like voice dialing and swype.. 
Cons:. User interface is immature. My main grip with this phone is the tethering function. It doesn't work. It would not find my PC laptop, Ipod or Itouch. It was blind.. 
Summary:. If tethering is an important function that you need, I would wait for proof of concept. Don't believe the hype or commercials. After a week of disappointment I returned my Droid X to Verizon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android OS is great. Marketplace works well. Other than calls performance was good. 
Cons:. Could not get reliable phone call service. Battery life was challenging. 
Summary:. Just returned it after 5 days of use. Switched from a BlackBerry Storm. Stayed with Verizon because of their network. Imagine my dismay when the droid x would not place or take calls from / to all of my usual places (e.g home). Have never had calling issues with the Storm (currently live in Denver). Lots to like about the platform but if you can't make or take calls what's the point? Will hold on until October when Sprint (claims) 4G NW rolls out in Denver.. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid, hefty phone with big viewing area.. 
Cons:. The phone locks up, reboots itself during calls, quickly becomes overwhelmed with simple tasks such as opening and replying to text messages and even making calls and looking up contacts--you know--phone basics. No, I have not overloaded with apps.. 
Summary:. Droid X does not live up to the hype. Get an iPhone instead. Verizon can't fix this widespread problem. I'm shocked Google would put up with a product this bad bearing its Android DNA.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice screen if you play games or browse the web. 
Cons:. All plastic, i pick it up and it feels like it will crumble in my hands. too big for pockets, plan on wearing cargo pants all the time.. 
Summary:. If all you want to do is play on and surf the web go for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I was in love with this phone for about 40 days and then.... 
Cons:. There is a known, unaddressed flaw with the screen. (When's the last time you saw an add for this phone?). 
Summary:. This phone has a (by now) well known flaw in that half the screen will stop working. (Search: Droid X &#38; Screen) Now, I bought the Droid X because at the time I was looking the Apple 4 had its problems come to light. For six weeks, I've been in love with this phone, great visuals, sound, camera, gadgets and then....half the screen goes black (actually dark with horizonal lines) I took it to a Verizon store and the guy says they will send me a new phone; but, no. Verizon sends me a "like new" phone. After calling uncustomer service, they said they would not send me a new phone (even though this has now known flaw) because I had owned it for six weeks unstead of less than 30 days. I don't want a refurb; I want a new phone to be made whole but that's the kind of companies Verizon and Motorola are. So: Buyer Beware!. 

$$;
Pros:. The sound quality is good.. 
Cons:. I have owned dozens of phones, this is the absolute worse. As it is a piece of crap I only use it for a moderate amount of calls and still need to charge it twice a day (I use a IPhone 4 for email and net). Plus other negs.. 
Summary:. The phone has a poor battery life. The reception is so poor I bought signal booster for my home. It daily drops the Bluetooth connection to my Jawbone and needs to be powered off and restarted to restore connection. It messed up my contact info. The size is clunky. The screen compared to the IPhone 4 is lousy. It doesn't disconnect calls when it should. The applications process is not nearly as clear and intuitive as the IPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. big feels like stone in my pocket. 
Cons:. big i found stone in my pocket. 
Summary:. it's huge and big screen but too heavy for phone.

Pros:. looks........... nice.. 
Cons:. If you work in a buisness that uses Small Buisness Server 2003 RUN AWAY FROM THIS PHONE. this phone will not work with your companies Exchange needs. both MOTO and Verizon are NO HELP to fix, because there IS NO FIX.... 
Summary:. wait until droid 2.2 comes out and test to see if that fixes the problem BEFORE YOU BUY..

Pros:. NONE- the phone was broken. 
Cons:. Phone was defective on delivery. Verizon CS inititally said I would have a replacement by 7/28. Now they are backing off that assuance. I wonder how many more people are experiencing such problems, hence the increased back order..
