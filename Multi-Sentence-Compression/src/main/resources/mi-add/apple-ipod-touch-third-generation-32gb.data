i love it  .
it works perfectly .
this is awesome for music , email , facebook , games , movies , podcasts , video , weather , and tons more .
am a wild fan of country latino and swing and i wish to keep adding tons of them to my stores apple ipod 32 gb 3rd gen is just the one i have been waiting for  .
sleek and chicer than my phone  .
the ipod touch is a nice system  .
it responds quickly and has reasonably good wi    fi ranges  .
the iphone os is well thought    out (still w/o multitasking , coming in iphone os 4)  .
this is not the most reliable device , however  .
it breaks down easily  .
usually you can just restore it  .
also , if you have a lot of content , it will sometimes mix up the album art  .
all in all , this is a nice , well built device .
in all honesty , i have never been more satisfied with a product in a very long time  .
worth every penny  .
the touch screen is very easy to use  .
it's a great size  .
(slick and not bulky)  .
the sound quality is amazing  .
o i can check my email and still be listening to lady gaga  .
i can check the weather , stocks , youtube , while listening to hey , soul sister i can download songs directly from my ipod touch through an itunes app (which comes with it)  .
so i don't even need a computer  .
(with the 32gb i can hold up to 7 , 000 songs  .
watching videos on there is a totally amazing experience  .
when i'm on the treadmill at the gym i like watching videos to pass time more quickly  .
the ipod touch turns on it's side , so it's a large screen making it much more enjoyable and easier on your eyes  .
if you're considering it , get it now  .
this is an amazing music device and i would not buy anything else .
it's soooooooooooooooooooo fun 5 stars  .
i am a reformed zune owner i had bought the new zune 32gb hd but after two weeks it just stopped working  .
this is the second one that i have had problems with  .
my mom bought the 120 gb zune and i had to take it back as well because it would not even charge  .
so after the 32 gh bite the dust after two weeks i made the switch to ipod  .
my ipod has so many more features than the zune does  .
it is much easier to used than the zune as well .
i got the first gen ipod touch and sold it and i went to buy the 3rd gen and i loved it .
buy this  .
buy this now  .
i remember when i first got my ipod touch  .
i never thought i would own an ipod until till apple came out with this genius of a device that will go down in history as the greatest mp3 player ever made  .
i fell asleep with it in my hand every night for the first two weeks i had it .
i loooooove the ipod touch you can express your feelings in the notes section without any one looking and for all the people who havent tried it you should oooh but its not cool to do that aaaaadaaahhh (l) its fie to do do it cause your not writing it on paper so no one can see it and you can delete it everytime you write something i write in the notes section every night ooo what a coowinkidink (coincidence) my god all the people ive told to get an ipod touch have and omg they write in the note section too im serious try it youll b amazed at how much anger goes away wen u write in yor notes section youll feel so much beta well im done seeyas im gonna go write in my notes thingy now (p  .
s im serious try it)  .
if you own an ipod touch 2dn generation , it is not a must have upgrade , but if you are looking at an ipod touch for the first time , defo go for the 3rd generation  .
combined with an endless supply of applications from the itunes store , the ipod touch is a unique portable device that has doubled as my skype phone , wireless mouse and keyboard for my macmini media center , portable games machine , portfolio for my web , video and photography work , currency converter , financial tracker , usb thumb drive , pda contact manager , amazon kindle , japanese instructor , portable dictionary , and music/podcast player  .
they could have charged me $400 and i would have paid it  .
amazingly , with all of those uses that i listed above , i've only spent a total of $20 on the app store  .
incredible if you do not have an ipod , get an ipod touch  .
period oh , and the facebook/twitter experience is sooooooo much better on a portable device like this one  .
i find myself updating my status and catching up with friends much more often .
this is great and i got it after the price dropped .
i am a first time apple product owner , and i think this little device is cool  .
since i travel often for work and pleasure , the ipod touch will be handy when i am at the airport  .
alot of the airports that i've been to offer wi    fi , so the ipod touch will keep any waiting time bearable  .
plus , it is great to find out flight information if your gate has changed or plane is delayed .
this one to replace a 16 gb touch (2nd gen) that is only a year and a half old  .
for some reason , that one suddenly stopped holding a charge for more than a day , even when not using it  .
there must be something i am doing wrong , because this brand new one , after fully charging , will be dead when left overnight , again not using it  .
this is a great gadget and i simply love it , but the battery life does not last nearly long enough  .
also , what is this jailbreak thing i keep reading about  .
want a pocket computer without windows , don't want to 'connect' with at t and don't want the ipad  .
this is the perfect ipod for you  .
if you think the iphone is cool but don't want the phone and do not care about the camera (for now) , you can have all the stuff from the iphone without what i just said  .
full ipod with itunes , app store , and soo much more you can buy it , eat the manual , and know how to use it .
i always wanted a device with good capabilities rather than its look and design  .
one of the most appreciabe thing on ipod touch is its performance  .
other devices always fail in performance  .
its not that they perform bad but the bugs and glitches they have  .
(small or big)  .
using ipod touch is very simple no need of reading manuals screen clarity and output is excellent  .
video playback is outstanding because we can view full screen with double tap and audio quality in videos is simply superb  .
(ofcourse we have basic controls like fast forward , playing next , previous , pause)  .
small inbuilt apps like stopwatch , alarm , timer , world time , calender , contacts , voice memos , weather , youtube makes ipod touch all in one device rather than a simple ipod  .
additionally tonnes of apps are there on itunes store for free as well as payable wifi connects this small device we can see mails , watch videos on youtube , browse internet , purchase directly  .
voice control , zoom , voice over are some exclusive features found on this 3rd generation 32 gb as well as 64 gb  .
bluetooth can be used for bluetoth earphones and other things  .
music     .
shake to shuffle , genuis playlists , cover flow , sorting music with artists    albums    alphabets    composers    playlists spotlight search is one of the most useful things to find what ur searching in ur ipod touch  .
ipod touch can hold upto 9 pages of applications  .
browsing is mooth with safari and touch screen makes it easy to zoom web pages as well as for navigation , qwerty keyboard seem to be easier and useful here definitely ipod touch is worth buying because of the fun and features u get in such a small device  .
note     .
i dont use maps so i am not including that in the review  .
updated  .
on jul 1 , 2010  .
i love apple reduced the price from $400 to $300 for 32gbs  .
the storage space is huge , and surfing the web is fast .
as my point of view i think the ipod is totally different than any ipod that the company 'apple' released and it's just awesome  .
although maybe not the best music quality some features make this device ireplacable  .
app store with +70 , 000 apps , games ect  .
having prehaps one of the biggest app stores greatly increases what this device is capable of  .
great speed  .
this device is certainly fast , beating all other pocket devices by a long shot (except maybe the nexus one but thats only with browsing)  .
custimazation/possibilities  .
sure right out of the box you get little to no custimazation  .
but after jailbreaking it the possibilities are endless  .
voice command  .
use your voice to select songs , this features awesome  .
not so good music quality  .
no camera  .
i would've liked that great snap dragon processor that the nexus one has  .
battery life    it has acceptable battery life but less than the previous model  .
still no oled/amoled display  .
this is the lowest end ipod third generation  .
but it's fine  .
i love it its fine with a huge ram section , its something you must have  .
unless you have a blackberry   )  .
love the device , but i'm a little disappointed that apple did not take the opportunity to advance the touch more on the 3rd gen  .
simple things like an fm radio capability would have been nice  .
a camera would have been cool  .
however , what the device does right , it does really really well  .
i travel a lot (75    80 , 000 freq flyer miles/yr) , and have historically used a psp for my travelling entertainment  .
once i got the 32gb touch , my balance shifted  .
where the screen is bigger on the psp , the touch is more portable (fits in my pocket) , has more internal storage , has a far better music player , has a kindle app with lots of free books , has lots of free apps (including check registers , games , productivity tools , etc  .
) , and does pretty much everything the psp does  .
psp does have a bigger screen (not a touch screen though) , is a better gaming platform , and i can hook it up to most modern tvs to watch movies from it  .
however , i am finding the touch a better companion on the plane , and i am using my psp more at the end of the day if there's nothing on tv in the hotel  .
to my dismay , because i really enjoyed my psp a lot , i am finding that i use it less and less now that i have a touch  .
i can take my touch with me everywhere , and all my books , movies , games , and music come with me without adding to the amount of stuff to carry just bring the touch and some headphones (if you want to listen to music , otherwise i leave them in my bag)  .
the psp requires external memory cards , umds , a carrying case , and is way too big to fit in a pocket i'll wrap this up by saying this is a great device  .
i wish apple would just skip a generation and bring all the best this device could have to market at one time , instead of dragging out the incremental improvements  .
you know they could do it if they wanted to  .
i figure this is probably the last or next to last update version of the touch before a total remake that takes another giant leap forward (like apple usually does with new products) , but i love it none    the    less .
if you want the best pocket all    in    one entertainment device , this is the perfect one , there is not a lot of new features this time around , but the price reduction is greatly appreciated  .
even though this is not the most durable mp3 player , it is terrific  .
because of all this , it is highly recommended updated  .
on nov 2 , 2009  .
bluetooth  .
app store  .
wifi (wireless    n )  .
easy to download music , books , apps , tv , movies , podcasts , etc  .
without ever hooking up to a computer believe it or not , itunes is be one of the best music managers out there    except for the often laggy switching between tabs battery life    40 hours of music , 6 hours of video 4 hours on wifi or playing games has an fm radio chip in it , but apple hasnt bothered to make an app for it (dont believe me  .
google it  .
no camera (i know , i know im being picky , but it wouldnt have cost apple more than $5 or so to put one in)  .
tied to itunes (nobody likes being controlled)  .
easily scratched  .
no flash in safari means no sites like hulu or for example , iriver  .
com , work (i know , picky picky , but adobe even made , and demonstrated an app that gave the ipod touch flash , and apple wouldnt let them put it on the ipod)  .
the ipod touch has its flaws , but , overall , i believe that it is still the best in terms of touch screen players , at least for now  .
the zune hd 1st gen looked very appealing , but its lack of an app store (which is actually growing right now) and slower internet make it fall below the ipod touch  .
i would recommend the ipod touch 3rd gen to those looking for a solid touch screen music player that can provide many other services .
long charging cord  .
no ac adapter  .
get an invisible shield for it , a flip leather case and a pair of sony drbt140q headphones  .
all things set aside i am very pleased with my purchase  .
coming from the creative and zune world of mp3 players i am very impressed with the ipod touch 3rd generation 32gb and is a worthwhile upgrade  .
the ipod touch allows internet browsing , applications , streaming internet radio (aol , pandora) , and even the ability to watch youtube videos  .
however if you currently own an ipod touch 2nd generation , aside from the faster processor , you may want to wait  .
bottom    line if you want a simple mp3 player then look elsewhere , on the other hand if you want a multi    function mp3 player/ video player/ picture viewer/ internet browser/ portable office/ etc then the ipod touch is for you .
overall , it's good , i suppose  .
you have free internet via wifi and lots of apps you can keep yourself entertained with  .
unfortunately , as a music player , it is egh ok i only got this because my samsung p3 is dying  .
in terms of audio quality , the p3's is clearly better  .
the ipod's sounded normal and does come with many eqs to choose from , but not a custom one  .
the speaker also got a bit annoying  .
since it's inside the casing , it sounds muffled and makes the audio sound worse than it really is  .
it also causes the ipod to shake like mad so i just hook it up to external speakers instead the shiny back is good for using as a mirror , but gets scratches so easily  .
in my first 5hrs of using it , there were little scratches all over the place already it is nice to see voice recording in here , although you need to use the included earphones to do that which don't sound all that great use it only for voice recording  .
the recordings themselves sounded a bit fuzzy but it was not anything too bad also , when browsing the internet , i found that i (maybe it's a personal thing) needed to use both safari and opera  .
safari does a good job at rendering full sites and works fast , but it doesn't work in horizontal from what i've seen  .
opera can do horizontal and you can also select large amounts of text to c p  .
i believe you can do that in safari , but it's more difficult oh and the volume buttons  .
always nice to have those  .
it's just that most cases for it end up hiding the volume controls because of the cases' thickness so yeah , if you do not mind the average audio quality and just need lots of space and internet in a thin package , this is the way to go .
this is also one other helpful link http  //ipodshufflebrand  .
blogspot  .
com/2010/01/ipod    types  .
html  .
def recommend it to anyone who is looking for a mini pda/ music player  .
i got this to replace my ipod shuffle which sadly broke  .
i is still able to charge it but i could not syn it with itunes anymore  .
after a lot of searching on the internet , i found out the problem    the jack    plug on the dock had broken inside the shuffle    or somewhere  .
i tried to take it to pieces with the help of the internet again , but it ended up in a million pieces so in general    i am a gadget geek and have always wanted a pda type thing and this ticks all the boxes  .
my 2 main gripes are the limited bluetooth options you'd think with all the options of bluetooth available there would be more options for this , itunes as a music player , is ok , but to sync contacts/calander etc is limited would have preferred the 64gb but way too expensive .
not much of a change from the 2nd gen  .
i went from the 2nd gen to 3rd gen for the processing speed  .
theres a noticicable difference  .
better for graphics and gaming  .
never crashed  .
no camera and video and we know why apple doesnt want to cannabilize sales  .
not a steve jobs fan but this device is off the charts  .
if only the metro areas had wifi everywhere this would be the device of the decade  .
i find a lot of apps like how to get around and transit apps are moot since this only works with a wireless network close by  .
the free wifi mirage is very annoying , too  .
its very slender compared to the 3gs iphone  .
slips into even skinny jeans very nicely  .
the email is a pleasure as is texting  .
highly recommended if you are in a wifi zone a good portion of time or else its a glorified mp3 player/handheld lame game player .
the ipod touch is amazing and fun to use but games are not always an option because of the coverage  .
you must have coverage to go to the app store and you must have the app store to get games  .
works well in starbucks or any other hot spots  .
the battery life is short  .
the screen will freeze up and stop working after a couple months of use  .
this is an all    rounder among apple ipods with best viewing capabilities not to mention the noticeably large screen .
if you are looking for perfection in quality , look to the zune hd (32gb platinum is best)  .
though if you are a light gamer who likes games like touchgrind or tap tap revenge and internet , its the ipod  .
i am pretty disappointed in all of apples products  .
dell i believe is a better choice for computers since they made alienware  .
i know this is off topic but if u need a new computer , get dell updated  .
on jun 25 , 2010  .
get the iphone instead .
wait till next gen ipod  .
books hard todownload  .
not user friendly  .
most downloads unsuccessful  .
itunes often copies book as music rather than book  .
itunes can sometimes not find books you've downloaded there is no bookmarking  .
there is no dividing the book into chapters as tracks , so there is just one huge download one has to choose in advance for itunes to keep the downloaded book in the library memory (one should not have to choose , this should be the default setting  .
if you don't , the book is not saved if you are trying to download from a second computer you own , a sign comes up saying that all that is stored on your ipod will be erased  .
there is a way around this , but i had to talk to apple help by phone to find out how  .
it doesn't seem that they want you to know this and several people have told me that they just accept the erasure as part of ownership what a shame apple states that an ipod user can only use live help once , though i is able to reach them through costco consierge there's no explanation for coordination of downloading into itunes with a main source of book downloads , libraries , including the net library and overdrive systems  .
i keep thinking that books have been downloaded sucessfully , just to find that itunes cannot locate the book the one book i sucessfully downloaded is large , 31 hrs  .
there were no divisions to make it easy to find one's place , etc  .
i tried to backup the book on cd  .
could not do this , rather than a message coming up asking that i put in another cd , the backup only kept copying the initial part of the book , a first cd , over and over i will probably be returning this  .
i have not tried them , but wonder if the devices like the zune or zen vision , etc , are much more user friendly for audiobooks if anyone has experience , please pass it on .
after receiving the apple ipod touch 3g 32gb for christmas (12/25/09) and adding only two third party applications and a handful of the songs , the touch would not run the third party apps  .
initially the third party apps worked well until syncing with the itunes software and loading a few songs  .
after that the system would not run any of the applications  .
it would simply flash the initial start up app screen briefly and close after spending about 5+ hours of restarting , restoring , deleting and reinstalling the apps plus countless variations trouble shooting , i finally gave up  .
i had the most current version of itunes and the touch so there are obviously bugs i know there are a million's of apple fans out there , but this terrible experience has not made me one of them i prefer wmp 11 and other media players to itunes since it proprietary in nature and will not play wma files without converting my entire song library wished it work since it does look nice and the touch appeared to be very functional  .
but all the pros do not offset a disfunctional operating system .
no multitasking  .
you can only open one application or built    in function at a time , apart from the music player  .
as absurd as it sounds , i am trying to carry post    it notes and a tiny pen in my ipod case so i can jot things down that i want to remember while working with applications other than the memo pad no form of ad blocking is available for safari , rendering many web pages a hell of intrusive messages  .
something i no longer ever see on my mac or linux machines and can no longer tolerate everything has to be sync'ed through itunes  .
the ipod touch cannot be opened as a simple hard drive when connected to a computer buying new applications has to be done either on the ipod itself or on one's regular computer using itunes ; itunes is a very poor browser because it does not allow copying of text or searching within a displayed page  .
when there are many options (i count 61 under  .
voice memo  .
) , there is no obvious way to limit them by size , price , functionality , etc  .
there is also no simple way to compare them  .
�  .
there seems to be some built    in support for a camera , but none is actually installed in the current version of the machine  .
apple seems to have planned to include them but then left them out at the last minute , without removing all the traces of them apparently no fully syncable to    do list applications exist  .
to    dos in ical are not sync  .
ed when the calendar is sync  .
ed the current version of skype allows one to send messages but not receive them  .
i guess that makes it something like emergency outbound    only text    messaging , if one has wifi no tactile feedback when typing (although if keyclicks is turned on and the volume is all the way up and one is not using a case and one is not in a very noisy place , one can feel the vibrations from the speaker on the back of the case) not all applications in which typing needs to be done can open in landscape mode , so one is forced to use the more cramped portrait version of the keyboard auto    complete when typing appears to be rather limited no arrow buttons , and select/copy/cut/paste are rather awkward no built    in microphone ; one has to plug in an external one  .
absurd  .
salespeople (i've spent extensive time with three different ones on three different days) are generally not very well    informed about the machine , apart from the music , video , and itunes store functions  .
i've repeated been given wrong information about many of the features that are important to me (which ones those are can be guessed from the above list) the only built    in function that can delay wifi    dependent actions until one joins a network is the mail command within the the memo pad  .
you have to mail memos to yourself if you want them transferred to another computer unless one actually opens the mail and weather applications , one cannot see if there have been any changes to the information they will display  .
so one has to shut the application one is in , open mail or weather to see if anything has appeared , and then close it and open the original application again  .
it would have been useful to have the home icons for the applications show changes automatically weather function fails to retain last update , so if you look up the weather when not on a wifi network , a blank screen comes up    .
the free application iflash is superb for reviewing chinese sentences when i'm away from a computer the machine really is a convenient size for use on the subway built    in chinese input methods , while nothing spectacular considering what is available for laptops and traditional pdas , do save me having to find , buy , and install third    party applications google mobile can be used with safari ; it is better than the built    in email client because it keeps messages threaded typing is moderately faster than on a traditional palm pilot (though slightly slower than on the glorious hp 100lx , of bless�d memory) the basic pda functions i need , while not really convenient , at least exist in a form that can be sync'ed reliably with my mac  .
there appear to be no other pdas of this kind now available in the us , sad to say    .
in sum   the whole thing is really still a multimedia browser rather than a pda  .
m really disappointed  .
however , it  .
s a satisfactory minimal pda (minimal only) for my specific purposes .
the internet is very random and not reliable at all  .
the only thing i can figure out is they normally have a plate in place to keep the prongs from being bent    evidently the one we purchased is missing the plate  .
the item is only charged with the chord it came with or the sony docking station  .
it is handled very carefully when being plugged  .
after only a month and a half it would not charge normally  .
we sent it back and they said the problem is from miss use which could not be further from the truth  .
so now we are stuck with a $300 piece of junk that does not work properly  .
oh but they'll give us 10% off another one or we can pay $149 to get that one fixed    well that's what they first said but after i quizzed on the specifics of the repair ie what parts would be need replacing how long would it take to repair etc  .
i is told i'd actually be sent a refurbished unit  .
it may be a really cool product but the warranty of the product in this case is non existent  .
i'm switching to the zune hd  .
listen you people can call me a microsoft fanboy but just listen , i originally owned this i      and i found out how bad it is  .
the apps are retarded , i mean a farting app who uses that  .
also the fact that it lacks a radio which is disappionting since they had three generations to hook up the i    pod with it  .
and a camera , i mean how many generations is apple going to come out with  .
if you are looking to buy an i    pod please listen to me , you will be disappionted trust me  .
make the right move go with any other player  .
i find the zune by microsoft to be wonderful  .
but it has to be the 32 gig because trust me you want all the memory you can get with that bad dude machine .
how can apple continue to sell   products that they call high end  .
the 20    20000 hz frequency response is total crap , i want to be able to buy decent headphones and use what i paid for  .
the human ear can hear as low as 16 hz , and feel as low as 4 hz  .
the human ear can also hear around 26000 hz , depending on one's age and such also , back in the day when it first came out it is pretty sweet , but since then , technology has progressed but the product has not  .
by today's standards , it would be considered unnecessarily big , heavy and clunky for how much you get out of it  .
the so    called upgrade didn't even do much , it claimed to up the speed , but it did not by any discernable means the app store is also highly confusing and is far too large to find the gems and jewels of programs that are worth anything  .
itunes is some ishit the battery life is also some trash , and is widely known to be highly inflated  .
what's the point of doing battery benchmarks if you're going to use the figures from the outliers  .
apple seems to have gotten complacent with their market position and seems to feel that it needs to do very little innovation to keep people happy  .
seriously , a camera on the nano but not the touch  .
the friggin phone has a camera , it can obviously handle it  .
the actual tech specs are some   too , this thing needs a real upgrade , not the half    assed work they've been doing lately , like with snow leopard and all that even i can slap a 3rd gen sticker on an older product and call it an upgrade and a day  .
not cool , not cool .
amazing display, TONS of super fun (and mostly free) apps; i literally cannot think of anything
volume buttons, screen, touch sensitivity, voice recording; audio quality, lack of custom EQ, speakers, other minor internet problems
Good functionality; LOTS of applications to choose from; application layouts difficult to change, keyboard difficult to use. connectivity only when within WiFi range.
- Multi-Touch Hardware. - Upgraded specs from 2nd Generation. - Simple GUI. - Comes With Several Useful Applications Built-In. - Wi-Fi Built In; - Breaks Down Quite Easily. - Occasionally Locks Up (Thus Requiring a Re-Boot). - No iPad-compatible Apps. - Touch Screen is a Fingerprint/Scratch Magnet
lots of apps, wifi; not much different from 2nd gen, sound quality not very good
Everything; there is nothing I do not like so far
little to no custimazation. but after jailbreaking the possibilities are endless; -battery life-it has acceptable battery life but less than the previous model
1) Visually appealing. 2) Many Applications to choose from (if they worked on the product). 3) Nice Touch Screen; 1) IPod Touch OS Does Not Run Third Party Apps. 2) You are locked into the iTunes media player. 3) Higher Price
Great B/G WiFi connectivity, over 100,000 apps to choose from, PLUS SO MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!!!; Doesn't have a camera; but Apple will update it next Fall.
Portability, versatility, durability, usability, funability, everything; I wish it had a camera and that it was a phone. Basically I wish it was an iPhone that cost $300 and didn't require a contract.
Fast and intuative... that's about it; annoying as you have to select every song, which takes 10 clicks or so to get to.
Every thing!!!; I am very happy with my Ipod. There is nothing that I don't like about it.
Just the one for the wildest of music-crazy souls; Until I break it nothing wil be wrong
Since the iPod Touch came out a few few years ago, it has been a massive hit with every mac/apple user - this iPod Touch proves why!; Shame there isn't a camera on the new iPod Touch.
browsing experience; apps; processor; ergonomics; interface, touch screen responsiveness, image quality; battery life; cut and paste; genius; the earbuds with microphone; price of $299; no camera or video recorder;
It's a really good product that you should buy it really fun to wate time with.; the 3 second app it turns on the app and after 3 seconds it goes away.
Ability to sync contacts and calendar with Mac makes this almost the only viable Mac-compatible PDA now available. And the free iFlash flashcard application is wonderful!; Intended mainly for multi-media; this is still a *very* poor excuse for a PDA.
So much to say! Wi-fi connections, great battery, awesome games, holds a lot of music, great touch screen, very easy to use! It can hold pictures, books, notes, contacts, calendars! It's extremely handy! Watching videos rocks!; Nothing serious! When connecting to wi-fi, my battery drains faster. But that's like that with any wi-fi product.
New drivers and a stronger video card and a newer and better OS. With the 3.1.1 software, start up is 3 times faster than a First Generation iPod, and 1.5 times faster than a Second generation. (I tested this all).; There was no microphone but it was never promised, As Apple said, It was made as a Game System.
I like everything about the Ipod Touch. Movies,music,email,games,apps,maps and all the other things this wonderful gadget does.; Water and electronics DO NOT mix. I spilled water in my Touch a long time ago. I will get a 32 or a 64 GB one day. I had the 8 GB 2nd gen.
I love all the features.... And its not just a normal Ipod..It includes music player, podcast support, video playback,a Safari Web browser, photo viewer, an e-mail reader and has alot of utility programs..; I didnt Find any Cons till now..
superior sound quality, biggest ipod screen suitable for viewing videos lwith lots of other features including wifi and games.; no fm tuner, no voice recorder. not pocketable. the bassing is not strong as ipod classic or nano
Love how don't have to wear earphones to listen to music and can control your computer via bluetooth. Touchscreen very responsive. Screen quality/colours fantastic. Not just MP3 player but handy little PDA as well. Able to sync contacts and notes.; BIG drawback is you are limited to Itunes for everything. No camera, radio, video recorder. The bluetooth option is rather pointless You can't send documents via 3rd party applications via bluetooth. Limited options with equalizer
Very thin compared to Zune. Integration of bluetooth and wifi. Endless list of applications (free and paid). Not just an MP3 player, picture viewer, and movie player--but a mini netbook/internet tablet. Great sound quality. Awesome touch screen. Youtube; Device attracts finger prints very easily. iTunes software is "clunky" takes some getting used to. Expensive accessories. No flash player, however can still view Youtube videos
apple's warranty of the product or should i say lack there of completely outweighs any cool features the product may have.; just pray nothing goes wrong with yours as in some cases (and I'm not talking user abuse!!!) there is ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY OF THE PRODUCT!!!!
Touch screen, Wifi, Bluetooth, App store, Podcast, iTunes download without a comp, the headset it comes with, accelormater, Safari...how is this not awesome?!; Still no camera. The iPhone and Nano have them. Shouldn't there also be a 3G option without the phone stuff, like the iPad? With VERIZON?
1. Great touch screen, very responsive. 2. App store makes it very useful. 3. Video player is great. 4. Safari is very fast; 1. Battery life is not too great. 2. You cannot replace the battery yourself, unlike the Zune HD. 3. I had to restore mine a couple times because itunes would not recognize it.. 4. You are limited to itunes, which is not very good.. 5. No fm radio
Portable connection to internet.. The idea of downloading multiple books to such a small device is appealing; Books are hard to download, help is very insufficient. Even when book is downloaded, iTunes can't find it, and how to correct this is not explained.. No bookmarking, no marking of chapters. No ability to create backup it backs up first cd amt only
Not much to say.; terrible frequency response means that no matter how good of headphones you purchase, it won't sound any better. lack of any actual update for the third generation is disappointing. terrible with fingerprints. not sleek small or sexy anymore
Love the huge GB space for the different types of media this thing will hold. I doubt I will fill it up any time soon. It's just a great music player, which is what it was originally meant for.; Short battery life. Drains even when not using it.
The touch screen responds very well.; Apple still has not made a removable battery for this ipod and a camera is still missing. When listening to the music without earbuds, the sound from the speakers begin to "break up" at higher volumes.
This product has gaming, apps, e-mail, and web browsing. The three ways to access volume controls are really very helpful. The voice control and memos are a nice touch, too.; This model is a little buggy. The chrome design is a fingerprint and scratch magnet. I would have liked a little more customization and maybe a camera like on the new Nano. The sound and video quality is average.
1.good touch screen (i am not fan of touch screen though). 2.music and videos Are amazing. 3.games are great with graphics and accelerometer. 4.battery is strong for music and videos; 1.battery life could have been better (only in the case of games). 2.If u want to play games for relaxation/timepass Ipod touch is the best but if u want challenging games ipod touch is not the one u are looking for
Bluetooth works with headphones and volume and stop start functions work. Great keypad. Internet via WIFi. Great picture quality. Lots of Apps. Maps, contacts. address book sync. Fast Charging. Long battery life. Good bluetooth range. Watch Utube; Bluetooth function to skip tracks is not enabled. There is no flash player to look at websites like HULU at this time. No gps. No compass. No camera. No built in microphone. Bluetooth microphone on my sony drbt140Q headphones is not recognized.
i love this ipod i dont go anywhere without it i love how you dont have to have your earplugs plugged in to listen to music it is sooo KOOL i love the note app cause you can express your feelings without any one looking at it its soo wonderful to hav; no cons except that you need to download the newest ipod thingy magig and it makes you all confuzzled (confused) and sorta angry that you dont get to play with it as soon as you buy it
The Apps, the interface, the wi-fi, Kindle ... the list of what Apple did right is too long for this space.; No FM radio (Nano has one!), no camera (Nano has one - sucks, but it has one), can't rearrange application screens from device - you have to use iTunes to do it, App store is not the best to navigate through (like iTunes).
It has a whole library of games and the new iPhone OS 4 operating system is going to make it beast. The itunes store is also a plus and its fast internet and accelerometer.; LCD screen was a bad idea and missing camera. Horrible, boring, on the surface games that only last you for like 5 minutes like bubblewrap or touchgrind.
I love my ipod touch. it has the perfect amount of memory! i love everything about it! it has everything i need! a calculator, map, calendar, and everything!; for some reason, when i click on an app, itll sometimes just stay at the screen where its like the provider for the game and then it will exit out of the app and go back to the home screen... i dont know why it does this :P
