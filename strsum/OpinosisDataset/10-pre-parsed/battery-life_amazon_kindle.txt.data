at first i thought,wait a minute,no memory chip,no exchangeable battery,a few other diff .

battery life is pretty spot on .

fourth, your battery icon stinks .

no user replaceable battery, , unless you buy the extended warranty for $65 .

for one thing, there's no charge except battery power no pun intended !

3the battery definitely does not last two weeks on mine .

turn wireless off ,  it saves your battery .

>> better battery life, far better with wireless function on .

the battery charged quickly, in less than 2 hours .

the battery life seems amazing .
