i have used this camera on numerous occasions and quite honestly cannot understand why some people say poor quality the video footage i have shot (daylight)has been very good quality and i have perfect eyesight this camera avoids the hassles of having to transfer film to dvd a great buy which suits my needs .
colors become very faded when shooting indoors ; almost look b w  .
supplied software is not very user friendly .
i bought this while out of town for my wedding when my sony tvr    11 died  .
i didn't have time to do my homework and trusted the bib box retail salesman who said it is a great replacement for my tvr  .
i found out later that my tvr had twice the video quality and didnt break until after four years  .
this piece of garbage dvd    101 broke after 6 hours and right before my wedding  .
(we did not buy the out rageously priced extended warranty  .
) the store swapped it out with another one and it has now broke  .
a different problem this time  .
the first is a jammed disc door and this one's toggle switch that controls everything has stopped working  .
the camera is never abused and rarely used  .
stay away from the dvd    101  .
i saw one in the store yesterday and went ahead and let the salesman make his pitch  .
he is clueless as he went on about how great it was  .
btw   anybody wanna buy a dvd    door stop  .
