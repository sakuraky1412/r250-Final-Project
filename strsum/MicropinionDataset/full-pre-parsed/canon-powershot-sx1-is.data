we primarily bought this camera for high image quality and excellent video capability without paying the price for a dslr  .

it has excelled in what we expected of it , and consequently represented excellent value for me , a digital camera needs three key attributes   1) ease of use ; 2) high image quality and ; 3) versatility for a range of situations  .

the powershot sx1 is does well against all these criteria .

all my friends want my camera for their vacations  .

i would recommend this camera to anybody  .

definitely worth the price  .

plus , when you buy some accessories , it becomes even more powerful  .

i am a dslr user but i find myself using the sx1 more than my dslr because it is so simple to use  .

for my use this camera might be the only one i'll need in the future .

too bad , it looked like it would have been a great gift for my wife .

as a fairly serious amateur photographer , this camera is what i have with me when i do not have my eos 5d  .

i bought it mostly for stills , planning to use t only occasionally for videos , but having a great video camera built in has allowed me capture wonderful moments that i was not expecting to  .

i shoot stills only in raw , and wish adobe camera raw would finnaly support this camera  .

the next update probably will .

i bought this camera about one month ago at buydig  .

com before costco had it in stock  .

i extensively researched and checked all other website reviews  .

this camera is rated at or near the top for superzooms everywhere i looked  .

i have had a few other digital cameras prior to this one , and by far this camera blows away the others  .

outside in daylight the pictures are crisp , sharp , and colorful  .

once in a while the focus is off , but you can usually see that before taking the picture , and re    focus  .

i really put this camera to the test when i took pictures at the paul mccartney concert at citi    field at night  .

from about two hundred yards away , in the low light , using a combination of manual and pre set settings , i is able to take over a hundred pictures that were nothing short of amazing  .

the 20x zoom is phenomenal  .

when i printed some of my pictures and cropped them , i is able to see the bands faces close up as if i were sitting in the first few rows  .

i tried not to use over iso 400 as most of the reviews discussed at higher iso  .

s the pictures become a little to grainy  .

i will agree with that review  .

but if i is able to take the pictures at this concert at iso 400 and under and get the results i did , i don  .

t see that being a problem  .

the amount of manual control you have with this camera is tremendous , and at the same time you can put it in auto and  .

point and shoot  .

and another thing , last year i spent one thousand dollars on a sony hard drive hd video camera with six megapixel photo capability  .

after seeing the video (hd and regular) this camera can take , i will be putting my video up for sale on craig  .

s list in the near future  .

no more carrying two cameras around anymore  .

oh and did i mention that while you are taking a video , if you happen to see a must have picture , you can take a still picture at the same time as the video is running  .

wow  .

before this purchase i is thinking of getting a digital slr , but after reading the reviews and now seeing for myself what this camera is capable of , i cannot see why anyone other than a true professional photographer , would need any other camera but this one .

while perhaps it offers slightly lesser performance than dslr , its features make it a high    utility camera  .

definitely a must    have tool for sightseeing , tour photography .

all    in    one hd 10mp 20x spectacular clear , fast camera by canon usa  .

in brief , 4  .

5 stars given    canon should listen much more from users  .

+/    us$ 500 for this nice camera is worth  .

good price for the feature set  .

although bulky it's half the size and weight of my d90 18    200 zoom so can go places where the dslr cannot .

settings are very easy and clear comparing to many other digital cameras  .

i've been anti    canon for long time  .

i is wrong  .

i used to have sony before this one  .

this is my best    ever    purchase to change to canon  .

price , quality , functions all happily married  .

highly recommended .

i own the powershot sx100 is and the canon hv10  .

so , does this make the sx1 is my dream camera  .

a 20x zoom on a 10mp/1080p hdv camera is exactly what an enthusiast photographer/ video editor like myself could use  .

but       is the sx1's full optical zoom active while filming video  .

if yes , then it's exactly what i'm looking for  .

i know my sx100is does not zoom optically while filming jpeg  .

so long as i have access to the full range of optical zoom while filming video , i am satisfied that this will be my next camera  .

can anyone verify this  .

thanks  .

great all    round camera , if a tad on the expensive side  .

having to order the mini hdmi online is a bit of a pain  .

overall , a great camera for those who do not want the size and weight of a dslr , and who have a use for the enormous zoom potential of this camera  .

i am glad i bought the camera  .

i recently purchased hti camera for an upcoming jamaica trip  .

i've always been a canon guy  .

i owned the old ae    1 and i owned an sx1 , which is an earlier version of this this model  .

i also own a canon , delphi , which i carry in my brief case for work purposes  .

ii trust the canon name and afer this purchase , i continue to trust canon  .

the camera is currently only available at specific small camera shops that canon is allowing to carry  .

best buy and some of the larger electronic stores do not have it as of the time of this writing  .

at $599 , you're right there within the price range of some dslr's  .

what hooked me is trhe hd video capability  .

i suggest you read the many reviews on the sx1 is and possibly go to canon's website to find a dealer who has it in stock  .

before buying , go pay them a visit and test it .

want some quick killer hd video then this is and camera for you  .

if you are looking for excellent image quality you will be disappointed  .

i hate shooting in auto mode but with this camera you basically have to to get a good image .

lori grunin  .

where is our sx20 review  .

i returned my camera to the vendor as i will not tolerate a sub standard product that is a known issue especially from canon who will not admt the sx1 is needs to be removed from the shelf due to failing parts updated  .

on aug 12 , 2009  .

due to the constant need for repair , i would never recommend this product  .

until now , i have always used canon cameras  .

never again  .
