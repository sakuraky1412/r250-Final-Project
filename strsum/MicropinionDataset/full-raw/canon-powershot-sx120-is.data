i bought this camera just before a trip to cedar point  .
the zoom is amazing on this camera  .
i could capture rides from across the park as if i is standing next to them  .
the adjustable shutter speed is great  .
the fastest speed let me catch one of the coasters at 120 mph  .
if the target is static and there is only a little light , the shutter can be slowed down to as much as 15 seconds to capture as much light as possible  .
i love everything about this camera and cannot wait to try it in other settings  .
my only problem with it is that it's a little bulky , but with everything it features , that's to be expected  .
i also like the aa batteries on this  .
with aa batteries , if you ever run out of power on the go , it's easy to just stop in a gift shop and get some aas  .
try that with some other camera that has a specific li    po battery that can only be charged with the given cord and dies after 3 hours  .
2    3 hours seems like typical battery life when it's on continuously , and when i use a camera for 5 hours or more , one set of batteries just does not cut it updated  .
on aug 31 , 2010  .
these people who say its takes bad pics must not know how to use the camera  .
next best thing to a dslr  .
it blows away my samsung nv7 ops .
worth investing money  .
i teach digital photography and i know the camera  .
this is canon's best kept secret in my book  .
picture quality is awesome , camera is easily used by my whole family    who do not know how to use tv , av , or m settings , as well as my self  .
if you looking for a great point and shoot with ability to have control over the camera as well as no control this is your camera  .
lcd works great in the daylight as well  .
the price is great at about $200  .
great camera overall i would recommend to a friend  .
if you're an old 35 mm film hobbyist like me , you can shoot this camera the way you like , and the way you're used to first , it's a very comfortable familiar camera to use  .
unlike the little , shirt    pocket sized compacts , it's closer to having the heft and shape of a small slr camera  .
my fingers fall right into the proper places when using it  .
i hate shirt pocket    sized cameras , but i love this one secondly , you can use it like a manually    operated camera , or a semi    automatic camera (both shutter priority and aperture priority)  .
if you cannot afford a dslr , or you can but you want something easier to carry around with you , this is the closest you can get to a small camera that operates like a familiar dslr , or even an old pentax , nikon or canon film slr  .
me , i like to know what the camera is doing , and even when i used it automatically , i prefer the traditional program mode , centre    weigthed metering , and centre    focus  .
the camera also has canned point shoot scene modes , but unlike most compacts , it doesn't limit you to those , and unlike many other compacts which do have some manual controls , the sx120 doesn't have any limitations , like restricting you to only a few shutter speeds or apertures  .
you have the full range available  .
even in auto modes , you're not limited to maximum shutter speeds like 4 seconds or whatever  .
instead , it's pretty much like any film slr you ever used some reviewers think having a flash that you have to pop    up when you want it is a disadvantage , for i love this feature  .
most of my shooting doesn't involve flash anyway , and when it does , i just pop it up  .
moreover , when it's up , it's not located where you can easily obstruct the flash with a finger , unlike many compact point shoots  .
again , it just reminds me of a traditional slr i like to be able to use a tripod , and the shoe on this camera is located more traditionally , near the middle  .
it's not relegated to the far end of the underside  .
seems to be polycarbonate  .
i would have preferred a metal tripod mount , but i can live with it  .
when you do mount this camera on a tripod , you don't get the impression that the tripod head is larger than the camera another advantage of the larger body  .
it sits on the tripod just like a normal camera does i shoot pictures  .
i do not do image analysis  .
for the former , the sx120 provides as good an image quality as anything else in this class  .
you will not be disappointed if you use the camera properly with the optimal settings for whatever kind of photographs you are making all in all , this is no point shoot compact  .
it's more like a compact dslr but without interchangeable lenses  .
so , while you can hand the sx120 over to a child or to your grandmother to take a snapshot , this is definitely an enthusiast's camera  .
now , i'm talking about a photography enthusiast , not necessarily a techno    geek who is more interested in specs and the latest whizz    bang features  .
it's just a real , stand up camera , and i cannot imagine anyone going wrong with it thank you so much canon for realizing that not every amateur photographer can afford or is willing to spend hundreds of dollars for some real camera control .
best camera purchased for 200  .
very easy to use  .
very easy to figure out different features .
this is my 3rd canon powershot and i just cannot believe how simple this camera is to use  .
i appreciate having a manual mode so i can be more creative  .
if you are a more experienced photographer , i think you'll really like this camera for taking snapshots  .
it is kind of a bulkier , bigger camera but that never bothered me  .
i guess it's all in what you're looking for .
the main thing is about the lens quality it is just as good as slr  .
plus you get all the great zoom  .
even 10x zoom i could be able to take study and clear pics  .
thanks for the image stabilizer it is truly working  .
i love every bit of this camera the images are so vivid and stunning , i felt there is no need of light room and photoshop  .
except if i need some artificial effects this camera will outsmart any point and shoots and will chase the slr closely the manual mode is slightly better than the auto mode , but takes time to adjust every bit of it moreover , the cost if you want any camera with this quality picture , there is a 20% more price is waiting for you luckily i have visited the canon image lounge in bangalore canon guys are friendly and very knowledgeable than the bangalore sony fellows .
over all powershot sx120 is is a great camera value for money best in class and had a good picture quality  .
this camera is so easy to use and operate and takes phenominal photographs  .
i'm incredibly happy with it and i would highly recommend it to anyone who is seeking a higher quality photo with out paying mega bucks for it  .
you'll feel like a professional photographer seeing the quality you get with this camera  .
i have been a long time kodak digital camera owner  .
my first camera being the dx6440 back in 2003  .
it is and still is to this day a fantastic camera with phenominal color accuracy and saturation  .
alas , i needed a newer camera so as to preserve the old dx6440 which i still use on occasion the sx120 is is a low cost , high quality zoom point and shoot  .
it offers a good balance , giving the flexibility of ease of use with room to grow into manual shooting abilities  .
picture quality in 10mp/fine mode are really great  .
color accuracy and sharpness are good , even though pictures tend to come out just a tad soft  .
it really is not an issue though , and can be corrected in camera if it irks you usually i use aperture priority mode for most of the shooting ; low f    number for faster scenes and higher f    number for landscape/scenery shots to get a uniform picture with good sharpness all around now for the negative  .
i find that the auto mode tends to default on lower f    numbers , even for landscape scenery shots  .
even landscape did the same thing , which is strange  .
this is not ideal as your depth of field is reduced quite a bit  .
i took several pictures of mountain shots recently , and the center part of the mountain shows up crisp and clear , while the peripheral parts were fuzzy  .
i locked in a f    number of 5  .
6 and the picture is much more uniform  .
in fact , 5  .
6 seems ideal for most landscape shots with this camera  .
higher than that and diffraction takes over overall , a great camera  .
i just recommend against using auto mode for landscape shots .
it's definitely the best digital camera i've ever had  .
i've tried using sony and kodak and nothing compares to this simple digital camera  .
it is not expensive but it does not have a cheap image quality  .
this camera can shoot a really still picture  .
the image quality is great  .
i am really impressed by the quality of the shots i've taken using this camera  .
this makes me feel that i'm using a baby dslr .
this camera is basically a upgrade from my canon poweshot sd    750 7  .
0 mp camera  .
im really impressed with the powershot sx    120is so far , as this is my first day using it  .
i understand it's a bigger camera , and i sorta like it because it's like a baby dslr/slr camera  .
trust me , not every camera is gonna be perfect , and every camera will have it's cons , and this one , is very impressive ps   get lithium or rechargable batteries  .
the batteries that came with it ran out with 200 pictures in an hour it's a real battery killer , buts its a good camera  .
use easy mode  .
it's a really good setting , for a photographer like me , it comes in handy  .
; )  .
excellent camera with minimal features but great photo quality .
if you're looking for a camera to use on your holidays , but you do not want to spend an awfull lot on professional equipment , the sx120 is a pretty safe bet  .
not for professional use , but great for the casual user who would like to get just a bit more out of their camera then they would get out of a camera in the same price range  .
being a casual user myself i'm loving every bit of it so far  .
its a great camera that's light , easy to use , produces good quality images , and has just enough features  .
includes video which is great for if you want the option , but do not want to lug around another video camera  .
we love it  .
i bought this camera for my wife thinking it is going to be a normal point and shoot average photos but i is wrong  .
i used it indoors at night at first and is totally surprised with the image quality  .
the flash did not over expose the image like other point and shoots i've used  .
i then used it the next morning with natural light coming in through the windows and is blown away again  .
it will never be able to match the quality of my canon 5d or 7d but for a point and shoot i am totally impressed  .
i cannot wait to take it outside as i know it will rock because it does so well indoors .
you won't be disappointed with this camera , worth every penny , we got it for $199  .
there are regular digital cameras that cost the same price that do not do half what this camera does  .
if you have a budget over $300 then you can find quite a few cameras that are way better than this one , but for us this is a very professional style camera for the price  .
the auto    white balance is very easy to use and the auto feature along with image stabilization makes for excellent day light shots .
i have used a nikon 4300 for 6 yrs and been very satisfied with it  .
but with the lens extended i got pushed up against a crowded bus seat at gr canyon 1st day there and crunched the lens gears  .
i had to buy a replacement and this is it  .
on this trip we ran into rock climbers 500 yards away , they looked like flys on a wall at that distance , with the lens all the way out these pictures were really clear  .
i too k some closeups of my grandkids and they look fine as 4x6 print but i tried to use it on my computer full screen and they are real blurry for a 10mp  .
the 4 mp nikon pis are clearer  .
i thought the image stabilizer would work really well on the closeups as it did on the telephoto , that is not the case  .
on the other hand it may have been me  .
i'll contiue to experiment with it  .
i bought another nikon 4300 on ebay for 2% of it new as a backup  .
good one for the budget .
this camera has been back and forth to washington , dc twice , to universal studios , islands of adventure , and to many family outings  .
i have scuffed up the screen a little because i have not had the time to take it to the store and find a case for it  .
when i do have the camera it on me it is usually in my pocket , i do have large pockets  .
i have dropped it about 5 times from about three feet with no harm to the camera i have started getting good night pictures out of the camera because i have fiddled with it  .
i would have loved a viewfinder on this camera for the sake of batteries .
bottom line is this is a great camera for the price , if your looking for decent to good picture quality then this is the camera for you  .
sometimes you might need to touch up the photos in photoshop but not major touching up is required , but most of the time the photos turn out excellent id recommend this camera to anyone whos wanting a great camera for a low price .
bottom line , i paid $179 at sam's club with extended warranties via the business membership  .
the batteries make it a take it everywhere camera with no special needs  .
overall good and many times better than acceptable clarity , zoom and focus for the average user  .
few disappointments  .
may not have the ratings for a professional , but great satisfying pictures for general use .
great buy if you can overlook the purple fringing issue .
i bought this to upgrade my beloved a540 6mp model  .
clearly i should have come here to read reviews before i purchased i like to go birding , and take pix outdoors mostly  .
this cam has no viewfinder , so it's useless for following a moving bird to get a shot in macro mode , if i'm not on a tripod , forget it  .
not sure what the is feature does , but i cannot say anything the wheel is way too touchy when i took it out of the box to load the card and batteries i had the worst time opening the bay door to get in , and any time i do , i fear i will break the thing off i also do not like having to pop up the flash to use cam is not a pocket cam , and is quite heavy on the good side , if i is able to hold still it does take nice quality pix  .
just not at all good for what i want it for i am taking it back .
fine for snapshots , except just about every other similar camera on the planet is superior if measured by size and weight (and i suspect image quality) i have to recommend you buy anything else .
it is wothless in the kids and pets mode , everything is moving or out of focus  .
that didn�t happen with the a720 is  .
the fact of only having a big screen reduces your options of catching an object in motion with the zoom at its maximum , maybe the technique should be explained charging flash lightyears , you need to plan in advance a shoot and then wait for another century to pass by manages to unfocus standing still the in detail information on how to use the camera comes in a cd updated  .
on jun 7 , 2010  .
i just bought this camera , and used it for 2 weeks , and at my daughter's birthday party the batteries died    not enough notice of battery dying  .
i didn't expect it after 2 weeks  .
i is told the batteries would last 6 months  .
it's going back , and i'm gettin the sony where you can re    charge the batteries    this is too much maintenance for me  .
but if you do not mind the batteries , everything else is great .
i purchased the sx110 5 days ago as a rep for my 5 year old konica minolta dimage z20  .
it took nice pictures  .
anyhow , after evaluating hte pictures for 5 days , over 300 i decided it took decent pictures but i found a sensor or development flaw and had to return it  .
i could not get the sx 110 now and had to buy an sx120 else where  .
i just got it home , took 40 pictures on my way home (i'm a fanatic)  .
there is no superfine quality setting for taking pictures now  .
big disappointment  .
i will compare the pictures and see if the quality is there still  .
not impressed so far , i seem to have lost details  .
i is very disappointed when i opened the box and the nice detailed manual that is included with the sx110 is now gone (  .
hopefully it's on the included software disc , but not as nice as carrying it around to double check things i might forget how to do or where to find  .
looks like night scene will insist a tripod be attached  .
i take many night scene pictures placing my camera on a sturdy outdoor stump or what i can find  .
now i will do it with manual controls but it should not be required to attach a tripod for the option to show  .
so far , i'm leaning on returning the camera and looking for last years again  .
if the picture quality is really here i will keep it , but i have not evaluated the pictures i took yet  .
they do seem at a glance blown out , i took alot of back lit shots and it's a very bright day  .
i believe there's more fringing then is evident on my sx110 , but that could be the day being so bright  .
the macro shots i took were crisp clear and well exposed  .
i'm still disappointed at the loss of the superfine shooting quality though updated  .
on sep 13 , 2009  .
i have a kodak z740 i have used 4+ yrs with fabulous results    1 , 000's of pictures indoor/outdoor/still moving  .
i am not a pro but don't do bad  .
i make jewelry and take tons of pictures of it  .
with this canon sx120 is the color saturation is terrible  .
i thought it may just be how it is displayed on the camera but when i download /or print it is still grainy and poor color  .
most results are washed out    despite the setting changes i do to try and correct lighting etc  .
my dad has the canon sx110 and i is impressed by it but very disappointed with this sx120  .
with his we have taken numerous hummingbird pictures (hard to do)    vibrant clear with no problems  .
i missed half my christmas picture taking events due to the lag between pictures even with kids waiting for auntie to take the pics so i know this camera would never make it with buzzing hummingbirds  .
i did notice that this camera requires very little lighting does not flash indoors like my previous cameras did  .
this camera is very heavy and i would not call it a pocket camera unless you have a big pocket that is reinforced  .
the only reason i got this is because i wanted a smaller camera for my purse that has the automatic lens cover since my dad's canon sx110 did so well i went to get one  .
the salesman said it is replaced by the sx120    do not assume they are the same quality like i did  .
the sx110 gets great reviews  .
this one is going back and looking for the sx110 elsewhere  .
if you get or keep your sx120 is    hope you have better luck or skills than i did .
great features  .
poor picture quality  .
had to return it for a better camera .
i've had half a dozen canons and keep coming back because i like the ease of use and have been very please with the photo quality  .
when i saw this camera on sale in the mid 200's i assumed the photo quality would be great  .
i is wrong  .
for some reason the phots don't look as crisp as my $100 canon i bought last year  .
the indoor phots are all yellow , the noise is evident in any flash phot and the video quality is crazy bad  .
its better than nothing in a pinch but if i had it to do over i'd pay more attention to video quality  .
its odd how often i use video for short clips in this era of you tube  .
i always assumed i'd use my hd camcorder but guess what  .
i do not take that with me everywher the way i do a camera  .
the zoom is fairly amazing  .
you really can get some good shots of a performer even in the n ose bleed section  .
so i guess you get what you pay for  .
but i is really hoping for more .
i do not recommend this camera  .
usually canon is a good brand , but this model stinks  .
the worst camera i've ever used  .
i've tried every brand of battery and , at best , i'll get 75 shots  .
so now i stock up on a 20    pack of batteries and hope i do not need more  .
if i could have found the receipt after the first 3 days , i would have returned it .
every picture out of focus or soft focus at best  .
my old kodak z740 takes much better pictures biggest downside you need to know is that camera takes a minimum of 5 seconds to recoup after a flash shot  .
that means the camera wo not do anything and when the screen finally comes back and you attempt to take your flash shot , the flash most times would not fire  .
i had santa at my house at christmas and about 20 kids  .
i ended up with every other shot not having the flash fire , so they were underexposed  .
all were very soft focus or plain out of focus  .
when i printed them my family could not believe how bad they were for this supposedly highly rated camera  .
bought a kodak z915 on sale for $129 and could not be happier with it  .
read the reviews on this to confirm that you will at least miss many shots waiting for your flash to recharge  .
perhaps i had a bad lens    that's how bad they were , but the flash recharge thing has been fully documented in professional reviews .
