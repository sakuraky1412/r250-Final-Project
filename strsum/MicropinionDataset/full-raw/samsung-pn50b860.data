this tv is very easy to set up and has a huge number of settings you can work from to get the perfect picture  .
the tv has a nice heavy base to anchor it on your tv stand  .
the widgets are nice to use and turn off very easily if you do not want to use them all the time  .
the picture , once you have it set up , is stunning  .
it's 1080p performance with blu    ray discs and hd tv is terrific i've seen a lot of reviews on here where they've encountered buzzing with the tv  .
mine has not had any of this since i've had it  .
i use my receiver for the most part for my sound , but i do have a few things that i run through my tv and there has not been any problem with buzzing at all  .
my only problem that i've had with the set is that the video board on it died and had to be replaced  .
this happened after about 9 months , i've had the same problem with both of my plasma tv's , so it seems to be a problem with plasma tv's in general  .
samsung's customer service is terrific and quickly arranged for a tech to come out and replace the boards in the set (all were replaced) at no charge to me  .
i've downloaded several updates to the firmware and they were very easy to install using a wi    fi connection i get a lot of comments arout how thin the set is and that is one of the reasons that i bought it  .
the picture , though , is the main reason i bought it  .
i saw it in a local store and it just said buy me as i walked by the display  .
very shortly after that i did i would highly recommend this set to anyone looking for a plasma .
forget what you read about the buzzing  .
before buying i read every review there was  .
i figured about 15% of the buyers were getting the buzzers  .
i is actually going to get the 650 to save money , get there ever so slightly deeper black and not get the ultra coolness factor of a 1  .
2 tv  .
i couldn't actually get the 650 locally and i just don't like to buy this kind of stuff online in case anything goes wrong  .
i made a calculated risk and went for the 860 and man is this thing impressive  .
solid  .
no buzzing or any weaknesses what    so    ever  .
buy this tv before it is gone  .
check out cnet's review  .
they rate it the very highest    best of all tv 50    53  .
noooo buzzzzz  .
the other complaint is the sound  .
i'd say it is adequate , but who really buys a tv like this and does not add separate speakers  .
you can use the tvs speakers as a perfect faux center channel fill .
i purchased this tv in the 50 version , pn50b860 , and i've only had it a few days but wanted to write a review after all the research i did before making my purchase i is sold on the very thin form factor from the start , so i is looking at the samsung leds initially before i found these plasmas  .
i wanted 1080p , thin , great picture , etc i didnt want the edge    lit led , so that is limiting me to waiting for the samsung 8500 back lit series to come out  .
when those came out i waited for the cnet review as well as some customer feedback  .
as i expected , the tv performed great  .
i wasnt too shy about the 4k price tag , but not enthused about it either ; i do like a deal if i can find it   ) it is around this time i found the 850/860 series plasma that's also the very thin form factor  .
the price is $2200 when i first saw it , and i thought this is much more reasonable than the 8500 series , so i started doing research on the 850/860 series  .
the cnet and other reviews i found looked favorable , with great picture quality , and in fact one of their few gripes is that it is a bit expensive due to the thin form factor  .
at basically half the price of the 8500 series led it seemed like a bargain   ) i is most certainly leery about the reviews noting a buzzing issue with the tvs , but after much more research on a variety of sites and message forums , it looked like that yes , the buzzing is real , but that it is a minority of sets that had the problem , maybe 1 in 10  .
so i decided it is worth the risk and decided to go with the 860 series in lieu of the 8500 led  .
with the holidays approaching i of course waited for a sale , and ended up getting my pn50b860 for $1579 i took delivery a few days ago , and have been impressed since firing it up the first time  .
i put it on the wall on a multi    angle articulated mount for viewing from just about anywhere  .
i immediately set the picture settings to what cnet determined is optimal in the review , and played around a bit with it for myself to adjust to my viewing conditions  .
i is instantly impressed by how much clearer and brighter just my normal cable hd channels were  .
football looks great   ) i then proceeded to go through everything else , sd tv , dvd , blu    ray , and video games  .
sd tv is fine of course , nothing spectacular compared to anything hd  .
dvd is fantastic , just a tiny bit grainy up close , but that could also be a side effect of my receiver upconverting to 1080i  .
i need to play with the settings and let it come through in the native format and see if there's a difference  .
blu    ray is absolutely glorious ; seamless , brilliant , crystal    clear , and a whole bunch of other adjectives  .
all games i've tried on ps3 and wii have been far crisper and much clearer than the old tv i have no buzzing issue at all  .
i will wait and see but i dont hear anything at all , even up close to be fair , i is coming from an almost 5 year old panasonic projection lcd tv , pt    50lc14 , 1080i i cant comment on others that have said the speakers arent very good , i have never turned them up and never will  .
sound and everything runs through the home theater  .
if you're buying this tv you really shouldnt be using the tv speakers anyway , c'mon the bottom line is that i'm very happy with this tv and my decision to purchase it , and that's all you can really ask for   )  .
all my test components (except the wii , which is component video) are wired with hdmi to my receiver , which is then wired with hdmi to the tv  .
receiver is a yamaha rx    v2700 .
at a current price well below it's stiffest competitor (panasonic v10) , this purchase is a no    brainer  .
seeing the 2 side    by    side , the 860 blew the v10 away , much more true    to    life colors in my opinion  .
and this is far and away the coolest looking set on the planet but that is just a bonus because picture quality is the real star  .
as for a buzz , have not heard it except for what is standard on plasma sets if you stand right next to it with the volume way down  .
great set .
when i is looking for a perfect tv a few months ago i looked at all makes of tv  .
when i starting looking at cnet for guidance knew i wanted a plasma  .
but the lcd and led look great also  .
i kind of looked past the lcd knowing i wanted something richer in color and deeper blacks  .
not to kick lcd to the curb there are some sweet looking ones out there but none that caught my eye  .
the samsung leds looked cool especially how thin they were  .
but there off viewing angle sucks  .
my buddy has a led and if you are looking dead on it looks good but that is where his chair is  .
all the other seats in the living room are off center and the picture looks washed out  .
i want a tv that every seat in my living room has the best seat in the house  .
also this is fist generation of the super thin led tvs , you never want to buy a fist generation there are always bugs that they dont find until second generation  .
i wanted something that has a good solid track record with great looking pictures  .
plasma there are alot of bashers out there saying they run too hot , drink to much energy , and bun every image into the screen  .
come on that is 10 years ago they have come a long way  .
and if you are worried about the plasma taking in to much energy well then ride a bike to work  .
lol  .
i have been debating on the samsung 860 vs the panasonic v10 for months now  .
i have read almost every review possible on almost every website  .
i have talked to guys at american tv and best buy  .
have gone countless # of times to both retailers to view the tvs  .
i feel its my duty to write a good review for all the other guys like me who want the best of the best tv out there  .
this is a big purchase i will break down some issues i wanted to clear up when i is looking at both tvs glare , its hard to look at the tvs at retail stores to get a good sense of how the tv will look in your house  .
a good way to judge glair is to get close to the tv , turn the set off , get out your cell phone or if you have a small light (key chain light) and shine it at the screen  .
i did that to both the v10 and 860  .
for this review i is only able to get my hands on the 58in tv  .
the v10 has a single pain of glass witch looks clean , i took out the light and bam i saw a double reflection of the light  .
the reflection is soo bright that i could see the # on my key pad on the cell phone  .
on the 860 i could kind of see a reflection on the screen but it is very dull and diluted  .
point to the 860  .
style its up to you , you are the one looking at it but you can only be amazed at how thin the 860 is picture quality , its a draw both looked really really good  .
i felt that the samsung looked richer in color but that is my opinion  .
both have cinema smooth , but the v10 has thx which is just cool to have  .
i will say that the v10 does have deeper blacks but that is not saying that the 860 is weak in that department  .
the 860 look great also not to many people talk about this on there review but i did listen to both sets with the volume on , not external speakers but the speakers built into the set  .
i liked the v10 a little deeper but the 860 is a little louder  .
both sets are very easy to max out due to how little power they push  .
its also hard to get a true sense when you are in a huge store  .
but i do have the 860 at home and the speakers are not bad i can watch tv at a reasonable volume and not feel short changed finally the buzz noise , lol a few day before i got it delivered i is freaking out it i is going to get the buzzing tv but when i received it , i hooked it up and i is so engulfed into the tv i did not hear a buzz but when i said to myself do i hear a buzz , i did  .
honestly its not a problem its soooo minimal  .
is there a buzzz yes , is it louder that the speakers on the tv on normal to low viewing no  .
during break in the tv i have the tv running and the volume all the way down  .
when i walk past the living room i kind of hear it , the buzz gets louder and softer during different scenes on the set  .
but overall nothing to worry about it  .
also if you dont like the buzz then return it , well that is if you got it at a local retail store like i did last big talk is heat coming off the tv  .
at the retail store they are in full out burn mode to suck you in to but the tv  .
the sets there were warm , not hot  .
i have run my 860 for well over 12 hours straight on normal settings and it barley gets warm  .
i dont know about the v10 i can only imagine its the same overall i am very please with the 860 its a great tv , its thin , no buzz , and very low glare which i am happy with , and the picture is awesome  .
both the v10 and 860 are great but the big selling point for me is how thin the set was  .
i am going to be putting the tv on the wall in kind of a heavy traffic area so i needed something close to the wall good luck with your search for the perfect tv for you  .
dont always listen to what the guys say at the store they want to make the sale do your own homework .
from the research i did , and the in    store comparisons , i think this tv provides a terrific combination of quality , performance and feature set vs price  .
the picture quality is stunning , the design/thiness of the tv makes my friends drool with envy  .
viewing sports and fast action scenes produces no distortion    as i used to see on my 52 sony dlp .
great set    is looking at the led model    for the $$$ cannot bet the picture of this plasma  .
i do not have the buzzing problem  .
i did make sure that i routed all cables per the installation manual  .
samsung seems very specific about proper cable install light weight made for an easy wall install .
only have had this for a week and it is a great tv  .
a bit pricey but worth the money updated  .
on aug 26 , 2009  .
buy this tv  .
there is a buzzing sound but you can only hear it win the tv is muted , but this is true with many plasma tvs .
i like this hdtv updated  .
on mar 15 , 2010  .
picture quality is a combination of several parameters and for me the major ones are   brightness / contrast / color reproduction and handling of motion  .
plasmas always trump lcds (and even most leds) in contrast ; and motion blur is still an issue for many high    end 240hz leds  .
coming from an lcd i can say the motion blur is almost non    existent in this plasma and the contrast is way better  .
this black now looks more like black than dark gray on my lcd the lcds and leds trump plasmas in brightness normally  .
but this tv is quite viewable in a bright living room  .
as long as there is no direct sunlight on the tv screen itself , you can watch it comfortably in dynamic mode  .
sure the dynamic mode does not display the best picture quality this tv is capable of , but in such a bright ambient , you are hardly capable judging the picture quality  .
this tv has 2 expert modes for storing calibrated attributes for day time and night time viewing  .
once you set them up for your family/living/media room , you don  .
t have to change modes due to the ambience regularly the color reproduction is excellent on this tv compared to a standard lcd and i believe this is due to the fact that plasmas are capable of producing deeper black level  .
the color just pops out and if taken the time to adjust the tv using a dvd setup guide like avia , the picture quality will rival the more expensive tv sets with professional calibration  .
if you can get this tv calibrated by an experienced professional (not best buy geek squad) , it can (almost) rival a calibrated pioneer kuro to me the picture quality is the most important feature and apart from that , the other major factors that decided in favor of this model are the 24p support with 96hz refresh rate , my wife  .
s strong liking for its super    thin ~1 inch frame and internet/media capability (not major since i use htpc) 24p support is very important for me because most dvds and blu    ray movies are recorded with 24 frames per second (fps)  .
panasonic g15 plasma also has this 24p support but it plays at 48hz refresh rate that causes flickers if one is (i am) sensitive to that  .
96hz refresh rate is as good as a pro crt and eliminates that issue i don  .
t have the need as drive the tv with my htpc (windows 7 media center and boxee) but the internet capability is quite good and quite usable if you connect the tv to your router through ethernet port  .
s a little slow to start but has quite good support for youtube , netflix , blockbuster , yahoo weather , yahoo news , stock and many more  .
the yahoo widgets like weather , news , stocks etc can be displayed as an overlay without blocking the tv channel you are watching and is a nice touch  .
if these widgets satisfy your internet need on tv , you can totally skip the htpc the built    in media player is also quite capable and can play almost any media files (mp3 , mp4 , mkv , avi , mpg , divx etc) from a usb drive as well as shared computer drive using dlna protocol  .
the tv also has built    in memory where you can download contents like recipe , cartoons , pictures etc from samsung site as well as create your own like everything , there are few issues with this tv as well but they are not significant in my opinion and probably a firmware will fix the low black level in 24p mode quickly  .
there is a work    around though  .
in 24p , change the mode to dynamic and then back to cal    day or cal    night the buzzing issue probably has no cure  .
some owners said a samsung technician can install a few rubber cubes to dampen the vibration if i want ; but for me it  .
s not really a problem as i don  .
t watch tv on mute and also my living room is not that quiet the biggest issue for me is the feature called  .
dynamic brightness  .
which this tv uses to improve the contrast ratio  .
while this might be a very welcome feature for many , and i don  .
t really notice it always ; i still don  .
t like a feature that i can  .
t turn off  .
also , i drive the tv with a high    end graphics card and can control color/brightness etc from there if there is a need  .
other dynamic or auto features can be turned off so i don  .
t have an issue the feature    list is so exhaustive that it is unlikely that an average person will even be able to use all the bells and whistles this model offers  .
apart from the trivial issues , it has truly satisfied the geek in me and i believe until larger oled tvs are available affordable (at least 5 years from now) , i don  .
t have to upgrade sorry about the long review , i actually skipped a lot to keep it short   ^)  .

on mar 4 , 2010  .
in direct showroom floor comparisons to the panasonic tc    pv10 series the samsung won hands down  .
i must admit the news that the pv10's were losing their black levels after a certain number of hours is not comforting  .
i did see evidence of this on the showroom  .
i did a direct comparison of the samsung pn58b860 vs  .
panasonic tc    p58v10 where the salesman told me the pv10 had almost certainly been out on the floor for at least 1000hrs and the black levels were poor compared to the 860  .
i visited another showroom where the pv10 is claimed to be newer than 500hrs and although the black levels were better , they still did not match up to the samsung imho  .
the colors seemed to be more realistic and vivid at the same time on the 860  .
the price difference in the 58 models is the clincher for me  .
the pv10 is $800 more in most places , which just could not be justified , especially with the risk of it losing black levels after 1000hrs or so  .
when i picked up the pn58b860 i ran into the local samsung rep and asked about the buzzing issue  .
he told me it is a known issue , since resolved on the production line , and would be taken care of by calling 1800samsung if i had the issue  .
it is a mechanical issue with the power supply than can be easily fixed by installing a washer  .
this is understandable given the small amount of real estate in a 1  .
5 thin unit  .
i have not had an issue with buzzing although it does tend to run warm  .
overall i am very pleased with the samsung and would highly recommend it to family friends .
i originally bought this tv as a store demo and do not recommend doing this  .
stores set their demos on store mode which immediately puts out the brightest , most vibrant picture that can burn the phosphors prematurely which can cause burn    in  .
also , the store model buzzed loudly (will explain below)  .
so i returned it for a samsung lcd ln52b610 and a panasonic plasma tcp50s1    both of these tv's could not even come close to the picture quality of the 850  .
so i went and got a brand new 850 for the same price as the original store demo i bought , by chance it happened to be on sale the picture quality and looks on the 850 are second to none at this price point  .
sd and hd content are unbelievable , no pixelization on sd like on an lcd  .
hockey/sports is flawless , bluray even better  .
i do not understand how stores push the lcd/led over plasma  .
they may run cheaper and cooler , but imo plasma (this one anyway) has unmatched pq the menus are easy to use and seem to have endless picture options , 4 hdmi mount sideways to keep the ultra    thin profile  .
not many rca inputs , my wii takes up all 5 but with a tv this thin you have to sacrifice something   ) speakers are weak but i have it hooked up to a bose cinemate for my main floor setup  .
you will need an external speaker system and i would recommend a harmony remote for one    button on/off  .
glare is not too bad in a bright room , but i'm sure lcd is a bit better on this front  .
i'm not home during the day to watch tv anyway so it's not a concern for me i have noticed some buzz but it is not as bad as the original store demo i had  .
work your plasma in properly , run it at 50% contrast / brightness , lower the colour and put the picture mode to standard or eco (not dynamic) , put the picture size at screen fit (so there are no bars on the side on sd channels)  .
set your pixel shift at 4 horiz / 2 vert every 1    2 mins  .
this will work the phosphors in properly and not burn them out prematurely  .
this will also reduce the buzzing substantially , and you may get used to the picture this way , i already have and i still think it looks amazing  .
glad i bought a new set so i could work it in on my own  .
i highly recommend this tv if you can deal with some buzz that plasmas inherently have , you will not be disappointed with the picture quality , that i can guarantee  .
i just received this and is blown away by it's good looks and picture quality  .
i is amused and at the same time , relieved by the weight of the stand , which is good for this thin , large tv  .
it is also sharp    looking , being brushed metal the picture quality is wonderful , but i do have burn    in anxiety coming from a sony sxrd 50 wega projection hdtv , where i didn't have to worry about it  .
i'm sure i'll get over it , as i do not run static images or do a lot of gaming where this may otherwise be a problem  .
we'll see how the anti    burn in protection performs as far as the sound goes , if you're going to spend this kind of money for a tv , you really need to budget some money for a home theatre system to compliment the picture  .
there is just no way to get good sound from a tv that's an inch    thin  .
it's just not possible (yet)  .
the sound is good enough for general use , but if you're going to watch a blu    ray action movie , you need to match the sound to the picture  .
i'm getting the polk surroundbar , which is reported to sound great with very little clutter i'll update my review later when i've had more quality    time with my tv , but so far i am very happy with my purchase  .
pros  this television is one of the best plasmas i've seen on the market  .
with its super slim design it makes for a incredibly space saving tv  .
its loaded with tons of feature ranging from it's intenet tv options to its home networking functions  .
it has superb anti burn in features which seem to get rid of what ever image retention you encounter  .
this tv also offer tons a ways to adjust the picture to your liking as well as 3 settings for power consumption so that you can control the picture and the energy used to power it cons  speaker that come in the tv do not really immerse you in the experience but do complement well if combined with other speaker systems  .
tv doesn suffer from some minor image retention if contrast is high but as long as contrast is maintained to a reasonable level most image retention can be handled by the anti burn in features such as pixel shift and scrolling  .
there is a slight buzzing sound when volume is low and picture contrast is high but nothing to deter you from the full experience of this tv  .
this tv i must say does have pretty poor standard definition display at least with cable but as for high def it will go unmatched  .
overall   over all i believe this is a great chocie of plama over the competing models and technologies (lcd , led and , oled) with its many extensive features that other hi    def televisions may lack the samsung pn50b860 is one of the best plasmas and hi    def tv's on the market .
i narrowed down my tv decision to either sony or samsung  .
i went with this  .
samsung plasma for the colors and aesthetics  .
the blacks are pure and colors  .
are vibrant  .
the tv is beautiful compared to a lot of the lower end models installation is easy , it is a little disconcerting trying not to break the tv ,  .
but with help and the foam inserts in the box  .
it is totally doable with 2  .
people  .
if you are uneasy , get the $99 in    home delivery i knocked the star scale to a 4 simply because of the buzzing sound that others  .
have complained about  .
sitting in the chair 7 feet away i can totally hear the  .
annoying buzz  .
from the normal sitting areas they are 12    15 feet away , the  .
buzz is hardly noticeable if the av receiver is on  .
if the volume is low , it can  .
be still heard the first week , i is watching a basketball game on espn , and noticed a little  .
image retention where the espn logo appeared  .
this scared me and i immediately  .
thought it is burn in  .
but watching other shows and using the scrolling  .
feature , it completely went away  .
nothing to worry about i use the tv for watching hd cable , ps3 gaming , 4  3 tv , dvd letterbox and  .
blu    ray viewing  .
you will get a little image retention if you have bright white  .
logos or black bars for 2+ hours  .
it will go away crutchfield shopping experience is tremendous , they are the best totally worth  .
the extra money  .
i got my tv on sale for $1680 with free shipping .
the pn58b860 is an excellent choice for consumers who want a high end , network ready hdtv without spending $5 , 000  .
my samsung is connected to my wired home network (with network attached storage)  .
this makes it very easy to access music , pictures , and video without a computer with a hdmi equipped pc or laptop you can also play computer or internet based media with excellent quality (e  .
tv on hulu  .
com) the remote has ample functionality allowing single button access to audio , video , and screen resolution settings  .
it's very easy to use with many manufacturers exiting the plasma tv market , i is hard pressed to find a better plasma hdtv for the money  .
also , samsung customer support has been very responsove to my questions  .
you can manage just about any question or issue from samsung  .
com  .
and i received a generous 6 month extension on my warranty for registering online if you don't want or do not need an internet based or home network hdtv for streaming media , then you may be better off with a less expensive plasma or lcd  .
but if you have high speed internet and $100 for a samsung wirless adapter , then you're missing out on some great features .
i just got this tv last saturday (4/17/10)  .
i had it on for about an hour when i noticed the buzzing  .
now , i cannot help but hear it every time i turn the tv on  .
i'm not going to go into detail describing because it's the same sound that many others are experiencing  .
see other posts and threads in this forum and avs forum  .
this is extremely disappointing to me  .
if it was not for the buzzing i would have given this tv 5 stars  .
the picture quality on hd content is as good as i've ever seen  .
the colors are so vibrant , but yet accurate  .
with cinemasmooth on while watching a blu    ray i see no hint of blurring or judder  .
for optimal picture quality i highly recommend calibrating the tv to the settings in david's review (cannot spell his last name)  .
the only 2 settings i have tweaked is the color temp and black level enhancer (i think it's called that)  .
i prefer the color temp of warm1 over warm2  .
i have the black level enhancer set to the 'darker' setting  .
this helps the display to achieve the inky blacks that it is missing  .
cosmetically , the unit is very attractive  .
it's not flashy or busy  .
i want the image on the screen to stand    out over the actual unit  .
the slimness of the panel is not very important to me , but since this one is very thin it's a cool bragging point to my friends  .
aside from the buzzing , which is a huge issue , the sound quality sounds strange to me  .
however i tweak the eq , voices do not sound natural  .
the quality of the tv's internal speakers are also not very important to me  .
90    95% of the time i'm watching tv i have my surround sound on  .
overall i would highly recommend this tv if not for the buzzing  .
it sounds like many of the units within this model have a buzzing , but if you can find one that does not buzz , go for it  .
updated  .
on apr 21 , 2010  .
i'm on my second unit , which buzzes as the original unit did  .
not extremely loud , but loud enough to annoy at times , which is disappointing for a tv of this caliber  .
original unit had a bad pixel , so i had to replace it  .
good opportunity to see if all of these units buzz  .
based on my experience , i'd say that it's likely they all buzz to some degree  .
i may keep the tv , as the picture quality and design are both excellent , and i've invested time and money  .
my advice to those want a 50 plasma , but have not made the purchase yet , do not buy the samsung pn50b860 if you are sensitive to noise .

the links above (thanks to the prior posting) are to sites/strings/forum boards discussing the screen buzz  .
on my non    wall mounted tv    stand set , as is noted by the other reviewers , the sound is heard mostly when sitting directly in front of the screen , up to approximately 15    feet away  .
with off    angle viewing , the sound diminishes , but is still present  .
the sound also changes with color/shade   some report a louder buzz with white/lighter images , while my set is with darker images  .
adjusting the wires in the back has done nothing the geeksquad commented that the problem has been isolated to a particular batch of televisions , and is due to a faulty fan in the set  .
samsung is going to come and officially diagnose the problem , but i decided to replace the set (it's only 3    days old now) best buy is very graciously replacing the set with another pn50b860 , but if the forums' reports are proven , then i'm wearily expecting the replacement to buzz  .
if this second set buzzes , i will simply replace the set with a panasonic viera tcp50v10 , which i feel is the best competition out there for the price all things considered , best buy has been very helpful , but cnet and other official reviewers have not addressed this issue or the host of strings detailing this very issue   for $2    2 , 500 , i o not understand why such is the case .
i bought the pn50b860 tv and called samsung to complain about the loud buzzing  .
it could be heard 20    30 feet from the tv , even with the sound on at normal listening levels  .
i don't have sensitive ears  .
i'm a middle aged guy , so my hearing is not as good as it used to be  .
samsung sent out a repair man to try to fix the loud buzzing  .
he replaced one of the circuit boards in the set , but that didn't help  .
best buy then replaced the tv with another one , but it also had the same loud buzzing sound from the circuit board  .
i ended up sending that one back to best buy  .
the best buy guys that picked up the set mentioned that they have had a lot of these tvs returned due to the loud buzzing  .
one of the best buy sales people also said they have had quite a few of these sets returned due to the loud buzzing sound  .
interestingly , a couple of samsung company reps said that they haven't had any problems with complaints about buzzing from this set  .
i guess that goes to show you cannot believe samsung company reps  .
i live in minnesota , so altitude is not the issue  .
other plasma sets i've seen do not have this buzzing problem , like the samsung 550 series or at least not buzzing that can be heard more than a couple feet from the tv .
i cannot justify the price of the product given the lack of support for upgrading function and firmware which is marketed by samsung  .
very disappointing  .
i spent a lot of time deciding between this and the panasonic tc    58v10  .
i went with the samsung because the picture quality is comparable enough not to make a difference to me  .
i also thought the built    in widgets in the samsung were better than panasonic's , and i loved the 1  .
2 inch slim design  .
then i plugged it in  .
i immediately noticed a loud buzzing that varied with the intensity of the image  .
this buzz is not coming from the speakers  .
it exists even while muted  .
i tried different outlets , and even turned off every other device on the same circuit  .
same problem  .
i tried this to rule out line noise , even though my house is built in 2006 and is certainly up to code  .
the noise is coming from the panel  .
if you start reading the boards , you'll see that others have pulled their hair out with service techs trying to resolve this issue  .
this is not a matter of a faulty power supply  .
this is a design issue  .
not a single user reported a fix for this problem  .
(and surrounding it with foam or cranking up the volume is not a fix) this tv is a good choice if you're deaf  .
if you're like me , you expect that you should get what you pay for  .
$2400 for a tv should not give you a buzz  .
buyer beware .
i cannot believe david katzmaier neglected to include the buzzing defect in his review  .
escpecially since there are multiple threads about the buzz problem on cnet  .
com including the following    .

#35 at customer service in greenville sc is as rude as any person i have spoken with on the phone  .
i love samsung , but i could not be more disappointed with how the treated me after purchasing this 58 tv  .
all i want is to be able to watch tv with my family and be able to hear what is going on  .
we have had to use subtitles and nothing is being done about it .
before you buy any samsung tv do an internet search for samsung tv power supply problems  .
you'll find many complaints about a capacitor issue  .
if nothing else , buy an extended warranty .
i had read the reviews noting a buzzing sound , so i checked out the tv in 4 different stores and did not hear any buzzing , so i broke down and took it home the second night i had the tv i fell asleep in with it on , and is awakened by an awful buzzing sound  .
i tried every adjustment on the tv to try and stop the buzzing to no avail  .
i have tried to contact samsung regarding the problem , but the service rep they assigned to my problem only works 9    5 , so i cannot get a hold of him  .
i cannot live with the buzzing it is giving me terrible headaches i am tempted to try a replacement set because the picture is so good , it has every feature i wanted , and the set itself looks great in my living room , but the buzzing noise is unbearable  .
if this problem were to occur outside of the stores return date i would be screwed , because i do not think this is covered by the manufacturers warranty please do not make the same mistake i did and disregard the user reviews of this tv  .
the buzzing is a serious defect and the manufactuer and the editors are ignoring this problem buyer beware the buzzing noise is real .
