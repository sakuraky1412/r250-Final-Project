i was a bit picky one breakfast that i only wanted to eat sweet potato that is not offered in the lounge yet the super efficient attendants were able to source some for me in a matter of minutes .
incredible !
arnel , the lounge manager made sure that we have a relaxing and comfortable stay at the marco polo - and yes we surely did.
