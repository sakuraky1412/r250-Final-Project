Pros:. Open, fast, aesthetically great, Google Voice fully supported, OLED screen. 
Cons:. Less sensitive screen than the iPhone, but big whoop. Otherwise, no cons.. 
Summary:. I'm coming from an iPhone 3GS. My dad (a Seagate engineer and tech nerd) took the iPhone and I got the Nexus One. He's constantly feeling like I swindled him. The OLED screen is gorgeous, the multitude of options...it's just a great phone.. Some people complain about the little ball (or phone ******** as I've heard it called), but I love the ability to customize its color based on Text VS Email, etc.. I rooted it and installed the Cyanogen MOD and that added even more functionality (720p video recording back before FroYo 2.2, .FLAC native support, etc.).. This phone is just fantastic. But then again, it's Android you should love. The aesthetic quality of this phone is merely its material form :). 

$$;
Pros:. Sold by Google alone, so we there's no bloatware. No FORCED custom skin, so the day Google releases an update is the date you get it, no waiting for months on end. Super fast, runs quicker than iphone or ANY Droid, and SUPER easy to tinker with. 
Cons:. The screen is beautiful, but completely washed out in direct sunlight on anything but the highest brightness; made better by the fact that you have one touch widgets to change brightness. The stock keyboard is pretty weak, but SWYPE easily installed. 
Summary:. I've been an Android fan since day one, bought the G1 the first day, out of contract full price; bought the Nexus 1 first day full price and have never regretted either purchase. For those of us who dislike touchscreen only, this phone has been an absolute blast. It's a freakin speed demon, and despite being so old (9 months is an eternity), it's STILL on par if not BETTER than the other Droids and the iPhone. It's also so much more than a phone, it's a minicomputer, and in 10 minutes time with the help of the forums I went from ZERO programming tech skills to rooting and installing system apps, replacing the radio. The best part is, such tinkering while absolutely NOT required to have a great super zippy experience is not only allowed by ENCOURAGED. Reminds me of the Scion commercials, (except not a POS), you can customize this phone any way you want. Android already works like a computer allowing you to place shortcuts on a desktop, Widgets alone beat iOS's system, the power control widget that comes stock allows you to turn on wifi, bluetooth, gps, sync, and change brightness with literally one finger touch. Plain vanilla Android is the best because you get updates the quickest, and IF you want a custom skin similar to HTC's Sense or Motorola's Motoblur, in five minutes you can find and install it! This phone's absolutely incredible, and i've yet to see anything that the Iphone or any other Droid have over it. Except the stock keyboard, the iphone keyboard is still the best STOCK keyboard hands down, but in two minutes I installed SWYPE and have been blowing "tap to type" phones out of the water. I still miss my 5 row keyboard, but the Nexus One's screen has assuaged the homesickness a little. Two lacking features, doesn't have forward facing camera, or an HDMI out. Not deal breakers for me because no one uses facechatting anyways, and if i'm at home where my TV is, i'm connecting my laptop, not my phone. As mentioned before, if you're getting an Android phone, THIS is the one to get, stock vanilla offers the most versatility and is quickest to get upgraded. Here's to hoping Google releases a Nexus Two at some point!. 

$$;
Pros:. super fast phone. 
Cons:. Nothing. The phone works great. 
Summary:. best phone ever. 

$$;
Pros:. -1ghz Snapdragon processor. -5MP Camera &#38; Ability to record in 720p HD via ROOT. -Freedom with applications. -FULL Customization. -FroYo 2.2 (450% speed increase). -Amazing browser. -AMOLED screen. -POWERFUL. 
Cons:. -Google stopped selling/marketing the Nexus One and is available only as a Developer phone. -AMOLED lacks in daylight. -Cross axis multi-touch bugs. -Questionable support for repair/hardware issues. 
Summary:. The Nexus One was definitely the best choice in phone that I could of made. I am a previous owner of the iPhone 3GS and purchased the N1 in April. I knew that the iPhone 4 was soon to be released but I was AMAZED by the package the 6-month old N1 came with. Fast processor and beautiful screen. The full customization of this phone is something the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4 just can't touch.. The browser experience is superb. For the N1 being released back in January, it is simply still neck and neck with phones being released present-day. The speeds and performance of the Nexus One are amazing. With the recent update of FroYo 2.2 , speeds have increased 450% from Android 2.1.. Users do have issues with dust under the screen and software glitches. As I said before, I purchased my device in April and I haven't experienced any problem whatsoever. I have noticed the screen isn't as scratch resistance as it may seem and is behind that of the iPhone in this department. I have ONE scratch on my screen and nothing more. It is very resistant but to say the least, it is penetrable!. Final word: For $500+ this may not be the phone for many. It was sold unlocked and is still being sold unlocked as a developer phone. This means that you aren't able to upgrade phones( unless T-Mobile has something planned) therefore you are stuck with a high priced phone. It wouldn't be a phone I'd purchase this very day. There are many phones that have just been released that equal to or are more impressive than the Nexus One. The Droid Incredible would be my choice. However, I'm on AT&#38;T and there isn't much of a selection of Android devices.. If you are with AT&#38;T and want a powerful Android device: GET A NEXUS ONE. 

$$;
Pros:. Internet speed, touch sensitive, application support, good talk time.. 
Cons:. lighter look.. 
Summary:. Really awesome. i dont have words to describe.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything, from interface to hardware and everything in between. Especially the stock Android rom with no overlaying UI. 
Cons:. Sunlight washes out the screen outdoors, but on the brightest setting it's visible.. 
Summary:. With Froyo on this phone, it's still one of the top smartphones on the market. The best thing is the stock Android rom built in, very much the same Android Roms I installed on previous windows based HTC phones that made me fall in love with the platform. I've seen the future, and it's name is Android. I was a very heavy Windows mobile user, constatly flashing newer roms on the phones, and never content with the closed apple system. This powerful Android device takes one root and nothing else is necessary to customize, at least not at the risk of bricking my phone. I am even running the nexus version of Froyo on a Tilt 2, a Touch Diamond, and an HTC Fuze.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Nexus One has everything I want in a phone. It does what I need it to do. Very easy to use / manipulate. Screen is amazingly beautiful. Just the perfect size for me.. 
Cons:. The in call volume is kind of low. Battery life is a little weak but I expect this from any smartphone of this caliber, when in use ALL the time. I can't put this phone down.. 
Summary:. I received my Nexus One 8 days ago and could not be happier. This is my first Android powered phone and i'm enjoying my time with it so far. A lot of people seem to be having problems with the phone and all I can say it's probably USER ERROR. Learn to use your phone to it's full potential then write a review. You should have done research about the Nexus One (and Android) before you purchased it, especially if you are paying $529.. Bottom Line: Sexy, dependable and powerful...Nexus One is a phone for people who know better. I'd put my Nexus One up against any Apple iThing (I was an iPhone loyalist for 2 years) any day. I give Nexus One 5 stars because it allows me to manipulate it the way I want. Android is the future.... 

$$;
Pros:. Google integration, 5 screens, multiple apps can run simultaneously, voice recognition is just awesome.. 
Cons:. Battery get consumed very fast, (max 8 hours surfing and calling),Bluetooth integration needs to refined for contacts lookup, Turn by turn direction{Not available outside US :(( }, difficult to take own picture with the camera, needs timer!. 
Summary:. I give it 5* because no other phone comes close to what Nexus one delivers, but still there is room for a lot more, call me a demanding consumer.. I want direction on maps from where i point to My Location. Turn by turn direction should be also be available on bluetooth headset. Infact they have probably forgotten how well the headset can be used with such a lovely device. Hope they fix this in Froyo OTA. Also i want to sync with multiple calenders, IMs of Gtalks basically different Ids. Not only mail but also Picasa, Gtalk, Calender etc.. Thats what it can achieve by simple tweaking and can be much better.. It does not mean that it is bad. The screen is just awesome, the touch is great. There were few instances when it was unresponsive but i am sure that has been fixed in Froyo 2.2. the phone works great on wi-fi, 3g, edge, gprs. It is a whole phone unlike others, and best is you can do lot of things simultaneously. The media player is ok, and don't expect more from it either. videos are of very good quality and uploading to youtube works just great.. The app store has everything one can need, want or desire.. ofcourse the list for latter two is limitless.. Overall this is a phone that is far ahead of its generation, there may be a better phone than this but not in the very near future.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best phone on market June 2010: See below for description. A great htc phone. I put it next to any phone and there is a clear indication that this phone's design and usability will set it apart from most other phones with minimal complaints.. 
Cons:. This phone will not have as big of screen as the evo 4g and will not have the 4g connection or hdmi output.. Is a hdmi output necessary? 4g is not really developed yet and not in every market. Size of screen is important.. 
Summary:. 1. Android operating system is superior to Blackberry OS and Windows Mobile OS. I have used both for many years. Android is simpler and more powerful at the same time. With the next update, storing apps on memory card is possible.. 2. Size of phone makes it easy to use. I use a hardshell case with it which I would recommend and a clear screen cover. Screen is responsive and after a day with the phone, it is intuitive to navigate anywhere. Bigger Screen than iphone and slightly thinner than iphone.. 3. Apps: The Android market is growing and already has over 60,000 apps. The apps do not have the same restrictions as the iphone apps so you can pretty much do anything you want to your phone. Use another browser or replace homescreen- no problem. Can you do that with iphone? No. 4. Speed: Fastest smarthphone on market with a 1Ghz processor and great graphics. This thing is great for video or about anything you think you can put on it.. 5. Camera 5megapixel and video: I use it all the time. In fact, I use it more often than my 12 megapixel nikon. Great quality and flash works really well.. 6. call quality is great.. 7. Battery life: works well most of day. I leave about 9and come home at 5:30. it last mosts of day. If i leave 3g active connection with voip and bluetooth on for car, it will go quicker but that is expected. I have car charger.. 8. Bluetooth car connection: hooked it up in 60 seconds first time and it works like a charm. love this feature.. 9. Screen: The screen clarity and brightness are great. If you are outside in direct sunlight. Check the autobrightness setting and you will not have a problem. The graphics do look good and vivid. There are some arguments as to whether the screen technology is the best or not. But the nexu one's output looks comparable or better than any other phone i have seen on the market.. 10. Expandability: SD card makes this a great expandable phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone was already a solid platform, but with the latest 2.2 release, the "cons" section from CNET's review pretty much dissappears. USB tethering; the ability to become a mobile wifi hotspot for your laptop, computer, Ipod, etc; faster speed etc. 
Cons:. The keyboard could use improvement. As the Android developers have stated, they know it needs some refinement, but it's currently functioning just fine.. 
Summary:. Bottom line? With Android 2.2 OS, this kills the Iphone.. 

$$;
Pros:. As of 5-25-10, this is the fastest phone available and has more functionality than comp. products twice the size, available car/home dock, stable OS that is feature packed, 100K USEFUL apps, widgets, flash, multi-touch, saves to external memory, etc. 
Cons:. The only flaw is lack of accessories, outside of the Google marketplace. That will, of course, be remedied over time.. 
Summary:. The list of Nexus One "cans": The phone has a 1 ghz processor, 3.5G capability, is completely unlocked for ease of transfer, can handle the largest microSD cards available (comes with a 4GB card), can store to external memory as of Android OS 2.2, full multi-touch capability, can view video in HD quality, can sync with your calendars or Outlook, can search ANYTHING (e.g. you contacts, the web, stored files, etc) either by voice or text through a unified and built in search engine, runs any application simultaneously with any other application, 5mp camera with a flash, screen is OLED which saves on battery life, can provide built in USB tethering and Wifi hotspot for other devices, can use WiFi for SMS or phone service thereby saving your minutes for when you are not at home, and all of this is run from an open source OS that is installed on more phones than there is iPhones.. The List of Nexus One "can'ts": can't be restricted to one service provider, can't make your bed or prepare your breakfast (yet).. Really, I would enjoy finding an actual flaw with this device that cannot be reasonably attributed to the fact that we haven't perfected 3D projection or nuclear powered phones.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just amazing in everything it does.. 
Cons:. I don't find any. Except the camera with flash could have been better.. 
Summary:. I found no issues yet with my Nexus one. Love you Google.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. Great graphics, fast processor, feature packed. I have not had any issues with my Nexus One and I would recommend it without hesitation.. 
Cons:. I am still waiting on the next Droid firmware update to make my phone Flash capable and the battery is lasting about a day with moderate use of apps, phone, and web.. 
Summary:. If you're reading this review to decide if you should spend the big money on this phone, I can only tell you I have been pleased with my purchase. I would do it again and I have no iPhone envy as yet. Voices are clear and the voice to text recognition is very cool. The phone's looks and feel are just "smooth", that?s all I can say. The on-screen keyboard works great. I'm using AT&#38;T service and side by side comparison shows my pages load slightly faster than an iPhone 3Gs. Call volume is not super loud on the highest setting but it isn't a problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Extremely Responsive/Fast.. -Voice to Text. -Widgets!!!!. -FREE GPS Navigation. -Highly Customizable. -Desktop Dock. -Car Dock. -Always connected to Google Chat (no need for SMS anymore!). -UNLOCKED. -Can be purchased without a contract. 
Cons:. This phone is amazing. The only slightly negative thing I can say is that it takes a little while to get used to the button layout if coming from the iphone. Also, right now there is no way to hold one before buying unless you know someone with it.. 
Summary:. I've owned the original iphone and the iphone 3gs before switching to the nexus one. I was a little hesitant to switch from the polished apple iphone 3gs to the google android nexus one. Android is amazing though. Widgets are the greatest OS feature. Also, the ability to add shortcuts on the homescreen is a huge time saver. I put direct dials to my contacts that I'm calling all the time. Now I only have to push one button when I want to call them. Android has come a long way over the past year. It's finally an solid OS that can compete with Apple head to head. I for one think that Android is superior to Apple.. Right now, this is the best phone on the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. User interface. Browser experience. Native google apps. Versatility. Camera. Display. .... really, I could go on and on.. 
Cons:. Inability to change the title bar color without root access? Come on, everything else can change- why not this?. Errr... thinking... applications to SD Card?. 
Summary:. Outstanding phone, upgraded from a G1, prior to that a Wing. My girlfriends fingers don't seem to be as responsive on the touch screen as mine- so, I don't think it's necessarily the phones fault.. All in all, beautiful, beautiful phone. Blazingly fast, great battery life, great camera, great user interface. And it will just keep getting better. I really hate to give it such a great review- I enjoy being the only guy on the block who has one. So, enjoy your iphone, suckers!. 

$$;
Pros:. voice control, CNET Scanner App, You-Tube optimized, multitask, crisp resolution display, WiFi, GPS, Android OS, Etc.. 
Cons:. no complaints so far. 
Summary:. it's a do it all pocket device. also unlocked, customizable, multitask, etc. I can't say enough. 

$$;
Pros:. screen, features, and many other things. 
Cons:. Nothing !!. 

$$;
Pros:. very fast. pinch and zoom ability for pictures, browser, and google maps is awesome. The camera is awesome. It is very light and slim (even with my hard case cover). The screen is beautiful and onscreen is easy to type. Live wall papers FTW. 
Cons:. It is expensive and tmobile's 3G service can be spotty at times.. 
Summary:. Love this phone. This phone has a lot of pros but very little cons. ALthough I paid 530$ for it, I use my Tmo G1's sim card so I only pay like 65$ (taxes included) a month for 400 mins, unlimited text, and unlimited data.. 

$$;
Pros:. Perf has been very good. loaded over 30 applications from the store and very minimal effect on perf. The new googlelabs feature-Gesture Search is simply amazing. None of the touch phones I had used earlier had such accuracy in recognizing handwriting. 
Cons:. The phone gets heated while plugged in. Google needs to seriously look into this. At times it gets difficult to hold the phone in our hands. 
Summary:. Overall a great phone. Will definitely recommend this.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the touchscreen: its size and resolution. 3g. How fast it is. Voice control and many other features.. 
Cons:. It comes only on T-mobile(so far).. 
Summary:. It is a fast phone , with a big high resolution touch screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great construction. Nice mix between metal and plastic makes the phone feel very secure in your hands. Perfect weight. More than enough apps, and much more to come. Great call quality. Screen is THE best out there. Very easy to use.. 
Cons:. Screen smudges easy (touch screen, so duh). Battery goes down fast. I get about 18 hours before I need to recharge, but that is me using it almost 18 hours straight, so it's not really a con.. 
Summary:. I researched this phone for quite a while before going with it, and I am not disappointed at all. I also switched from Verizon to T-Mobile. This was a leap of faith. I took a survey of my friends who had what service, and more than not I received better answers from T-Mobile users, so I switched instead of waiting for Verizon's version. I'm glad I did. Much better reception and call quality (At least for me since location has a lot to do with it, and I'm in Orlando, FL). Much cheaper plan. I had a 17% corporate discount with Verizon, and if I stayed with them, I would have paid $20 MORE a mouth for the same plan and features, and that is with my discount. I have been using it all day everyday, and keep finding cool new features. I did use an iphone, and I hate comparing the two, but everyone does, so here is my comparison. Pretty much even. N1 can multitask, and has a much better look and feel. Call quality is better on N1 too. The screen size it a bit larger, but much better looking, and sharper. The bottom line for me is this phone rocks. Don't think twice to buy it sight unseen online. You will not be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's fast, very very fast. Voice to text while not perfect is very handy. Sleek and slim unlike other android phones. Unlocked and totally open for use without restriction. All the Google goodies like maps navigation voice listen Gmail etc.. 
Cons:. Media player works but is a little plain Jane. The OS still is a little shakey and needs tasks killed or a reboot every so often. 4 gig sdhc installed is nice but 8 wouldn't have set them back too much either.. 
Summary:. The greatest phone I have ever owned. Don't want an iPhone you should get this. Want to get an iPhone? look at this as well. Flash is nice but a little behind the internet's. I love the live desktop. Did I mention slim and sexy like a supermodel.. Updated. on May 23, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Its so damn good... best looking... so good.... 
Cons:. Takes time to learn this phone, you discover something new every day. 
Summary:. Trust me dont compare with iphone, never used iphone so dont know it. This phone looks 100 times sexier than iphone, just hold this in your hand and feel. I took this to mall to get protector sheet. everyone was looking at this phone, made me feel very proud, this one is the best... The good thing there is a solution to fix any issue you face in this phone, only thing you need to either discover or read online menu .... 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, display, ease of use, design, speech to text, customizable home pages. 
Cons:. Hesitates when working with multiple apps. That acccount for .01 percent of the time, so really not a problem.. 
Summary:. Only people who spend all day worshiping the next new device will se major flaws. Us regular folks think its great!. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. Keyboard, pinch zoom, fastest cpu, camera 5mp. 
Cons:. Not much cons expect for 3g speed, but that's not nexus one fault really, it's t-mobile, it has the lowest monthly cost on all carriers. Give them a break! all these bad things, NOT BAD AT ALLL! give it a chance!. 
Summary:. Got the droid last month, didn't like it, too bunky, I went from iphone to droid, so I wasnt used to it. But this nexus one, is for sure better than iphone in all the bad ways, and has all the features that iPhone excelled at. GIVE IT A CHANCE! YOU WILL LIKE IT! Also you have to have the right apps for the phone. Maybe that's why people don't understand it much. 

$$;
Pros:. All the pro's you've read about the nexus one are true! Pinch to zoom, fast processor, stability, and picture quality.. 
Cons:. 3g network goes in and out, but there is a quick fix for it, and now it works wonder. 
Summary:. Best phone ever, I used to have an iphone 3gs w ATT, it was the best phone 2 years ago, until iphone users abused the network, now it's one of the slowest speed ever! So I switched to Nexus one. It has almost every good things that Iphone has to offer, (along with other apps). Yet, replaces all the cons of an iphone. The ne-sayers are criticizing the phone, they are just haters, or they don't really know how to make the best use of the Nexus one.. Updated. on Feb 8, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. fast cpu, awesome camera and video compared to droid and iphone, multi-touch, multi-TASKING, great voice features for dialing and navigation and that are associated w/ the voice, awesome resolution and colors, micro sd card slot, beautiful navigation. 
Cons:. no physical keyboard, still waiting for android market apps to catch up w/the iphone apps. 
Summary:. phone w/all you need in a smartphone. beats all of them hand down....i have tried all smartphones...this is the best thus far.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great phone, awesome pocket computer, beautiful form factor, good camera, free GPS, Google service integration, voice to text in all text fields, multi tasking, FAST, "active" wallpapers, customization, great apps. Multitouch. Andriod OS. 
Cons:. Touch screen very occasionally screws up (incorrectly registering presses) requiring a power cycle to fix. More complicated than the iPhone. Apps not as polished as iPhone Apps.. 
Summary:. This phone is fast. You can run 10 different apps and switch between between them in half a second. Web pages load fast, fast, fast over wifi (first phone to use 801.11n) and t-mobile 3g is more than adequate for my needs. Cloud connection with google services is pretty amazing. Voice to text is suprisingly awesome - I hardly ever bother with the onscreen keyboard now although it's as good as the iPhone in my opinion. I took me about a week to really figure out what the phone can do. But if you bother to read the manual unlike me, then you may learn how to operate the phone quicker. Coming from the iPhone OS, it took awhile for me to get over the fact that Andriod is different and initially I was expecting things to work as they do on the iPhone. But now that I've had the phone for a month, I'm in love with Andriod and can't imagine ever going back. Google so far has been super responsive to customer needs. They just released an over the air update to the OS that enables pinch-to-zoom in some of the native apps and cleaned up some 3G reception issues - and the phone has been out barely a month. Google has done incredible work here with Andriod - in a few years it has brought it to a level where it competes with the iPhone OS and there's no signs of it slowing down. The devleoper community for andriod is growing and apps get better with time and an increasing user base. The andriod market has a 24 hour return policy on all apps which helps foster useful, high quality apps over sheer quantity. Apple will have to have to pull out something truly awesome with iPhone 4.0 to reclaim the title of best smartphone and I'm glad there's some competition now as it means great things for the users of these devices.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen to die for.. Got Multitouch OTA from Google.. 
Cons:. Quality apps. 
Summary:. The Nexus beats the Iphone is almost every category for me. I have used the IPhone for the last 2 years.. Better Screen - The OLED screen is so much better than the Iphone. Those Youtube videos don't do the Nexus justice. I have the Iphone 3GS and Nexus in hand and the Iphone is not even close. Nexus screen is much brighter with double the resolution.. Better calls - I go really sick of ATT in SoCal. 1 in 20 calls over 10 minutes would drop. Tmobile works better for me. I sure some will wait for Verizon to get the best call quality.. Better battery- Batter life on the Nexus is about 20% better for me. I'm comparing when my Iphone was new. Also Nexus batter is easily replaceable.. Better build quality - Not mentioned in many reviews, but the Nexus is partially made of aluminum. It feels sturdier in the hand. Two of my Iphone friends also were impress with build quality.. Better CPU - Snapdragon from Qualcomm is a beast. 1000mhz vs 600 for Iphone.. Web page loading - Nexus is a wee bit faster on most pages for me on Wifi and 3G.. Voice Recognition - Works great. I text using voice, search using voice, and make calls using voice.. I will not miss my Iphone. It had better apps, but Android gains thousands every month. The Nexus is newer technology and simply more powerful than my Iphone. I'm sure the next Iphone will be awesome, but right now the Nexus is king. I don't know how anyone can put an Iphone above the Nexus, especially when most of them don't even own a Nexus.. I also know Iphone fans will be hurt and are always flaming on any product than may be better. Applel die hards are truly in fact from the same DNA as Steve Jobs. I too love Apple products, but Steve has gotten too arrogant for my taste. He's an great CEO and makes some great products but lately he thinks he's an IGod. He dumps on Michael Dell, dumps on Google, and rips on Adobe, and that's just getting started.. Anyhow, anyone who "really" buys a Nexus will be happy. It is a very good device.. Updated. on Feb 4, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Integrates with Google services (Gmail, Finance, Chat etc). Fast and responsive (sports a 1GHz chip). 3.5G and HSDPA support for fast internet (not found on the iPhone). Run multiple applications simultaneously (not available on the iPhone). 5MP camera. 
Cons:. Some users may prefer a keyboard, although the virtual keyboard is very good on the Nexus One;. Marketplace has yet to offer as many applications (although managed to find everything I need including SatNav applications free). 
Summary:. Have previously owned an iPhone, HTC Diamond and Nokia N95. I've engaged in mobile phone development on such platforms as Windows Mobile (C#), iPhone (Objective C) and Android (Dalvik Java) - I've had some experiences which suggest that the Android Operating System is at present the best Mobile Operating System available for mobile devices. We were just waiting for the right device to kick things off and the HTC Nexus One is that device.... If you intend to use a mobile phone for just phoning, the Nexus One is not the so-called "phone" for you. Something simpler may be more applicable. What the Nexus One is, is a fully fledged computer and in that sense you could consider it like any Netbook or Laptop on the market - you should expect the Nexus One to do everything your Netbook or Laptop can do, but with a smaller screen.. The most important benefit of the Nexus One is it's integration of Google Services, like Gmail, Chat, Finance, Maps and other social networking applications like Facebook and Twitter. Services can be synchronised providing seamless interaction with the Internet services you are used to. The technological improvements are not lost on the user either. The 1GHz Snap Dragon chipset provides a very responsive experience and the capacity to use 3.5G, HSDPA standards and WiFi for fantastic internet connectivity is excellent and (3G and HSDPA are not found on the iPhone making the internet sluggish). The Nexus One (being Android) allows for multiple concurrent applications to run (Apple disallow this). I found the device to survive very well for 20 hours (with WiFi and GPS on). These features can be switched on and off easily to save battery power. Not only a good all round consumer device, it provides a great platform for developing applications as well, not requiring signing like both Apple iPhone and Nokia applications.. Other applications like Google Voice and Speech-to-Text are also provided and surprisingly good given that they are new technologies. Speech-to-Text is quite accurate allowing a user to talk to the Nexus One instead of entering text into text fields using the virtual keyboard. Music can be accessed through the Google Player, Spotify or the Amazon MP3 Store.. Almost everything is customizable and if you're really so crazy about multi-touch, multi-touch will be available in Europe but not in the US due to Apple patents. Installing and un-installing applications from the Marketplace is easy and quick.. All in all, a completely different experience than what I've had with other phones and a glimpse on a bright future for the Android Operating System - definitely a device worth heavy consideration.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast Beautiful Fun Highest End Technology as of this date.. 
Cons:. Would have liked an External camera button but seeing as how nice the camera Picture quality is I can look past that, PLease google enable Multi-Touch in your native apps, we all KNOW its a Multi-touch panel and works Excellent in 3rd party apps.. 
Summary:. It has Everything a Smart phone should have today and it does each and every one of them extremely well. The Snap dragon 1gigahertz processor FLIES!!!! You really notice it in everything you do and the 512 RAM is a HUGE PLUS! Both help leap this phone performance wise over any other phone in the market currently.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast!, elegant, multi-tasking, multi-touch (yes, it is multi-touch capable), removable storage, awesome AMOLED screen, Includes free Google Maps app with narrated turn by turn GPS navigation, 5mp camera, open OS, very customizable.. 
Cons:. Less than perfect touch screen sense - The iPhone does seem a little smoother in this area.. The select/copy/paste works great, but not quite as elegant as the iPhone's.. Not a lot of multi-touch apps available, yet. This will change soon I am sure.. 
Summary:. As close to perfect as any phone on the market gets. Best phone on the market and does most everything you could want it to, despite reviewers saying it cannot do many things that it can. It does support multi-touch, but Google does not include multi-touch features in the default shipped applications (In the US market), no doubt because they do not want to get sued by Apple. There are already apps on the Android market that use multi-touch, such as the "Dolphin" web browser. Also, you can sync Exchange email, contacts, AND calendar, and tasks; but this requires an app called "Touch Down", which is another $20. I hope to see this integrated into the next release of Android.. Multi-tasking is key for any power user. You get great functionality out of the box that the iPhone requires jail breaking to come close to. For instance, you can install a "lo-jack"-like app (such as "Mobile Defense") that you can activate if your phone gets lost or stolen. That is possible because Android allows apps to run as services in the background.. To get full Exchange syncing (including calendar), you need a paid app (~$20) to do this. But this is possible, and something all reviews I have read say is not possible on the Nexus One.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely fast and clean. You can really feel the 1 g processor power with this phone. It pretty much always you to take full control over all elements of the phone.. 
Cons:. Not for the none tech savvy. If you how problems with technology stay with the i phone.. Also the phone jumps between 2g and 3g rapidly. All though you don't really notice that much of difference because of the added processing power.. 
Summary:. It continues to surprise me with its usability. The more i get comfortable with the phone features better it gets.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful hi-res, deep color screen.. Fast, fast processor. Active noise reduction really works. Sleek design in the hand. Multitasking. Not tied to iTunes for music. Infinitely customizable home screens. Decent camera w/flash. Built in Google Nav, Latitudes. 
Cons:. No multitouch in native browser (have to d/l Dolphin). Confused support between Google/HTC/TMobile. 
Summary:. We bought two of these the day they went on sale. Both have performed without a hitch. We've had no problems with the touchscreen or 3G reception, which some have reported.. The screen is gorgeous, and the Nexus really lets you show it off with the animated wallpapers. The processor is very fast; on long webpages my iPhone would "checkerboard" as it tried to keep up with scrolling. On the Nexus, using the same wifi connection, their is NO lag.. The active noise reduction is great. You can make a call from a noisy subway station or basketball game and the caller at the other end doesn't hears almost none of the background noise. This should be standard on every phone.. I'm not sure Google will succeed in breaking the subsidized phone monopolies that some carriers have created for themselves, but I give them credit for trying. In the meantime, though, having support for the sale through Google, support for the phone warranty through HTC, and support for phone service through a third entity creates confusion. That hasn't been a problem for me, since both phones have been perfect, but it's a potential issue.. Overall, there is no other phone that matches the screen, performance or customization of the Nexus all in one package. It makes my iPhone seem rather boring now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to navigate and use. Gmail &#38; Google calendar ease of setup. Bbrilliant screen, fast processing, light weight, lots of apps, works well on 3G . Voice text (messaging) is amazing! This 61 year old geek loves this phone!. 
Cons:. Cnet is wrong (see below). Only had this 8 days so learning curve is slightly steep, but have figured everything out thus far except how to look up something in the far future (6 months) on the calendar. Probably my ignorance only.. 
Summary:. Multi-touch is there, as can be seen by downloading "Dolphin Browser" (free) from Marketplace and using it as another browser (if not set as the default, you get a selection window when going to the Internet). So, maybe Google did not want to flaunt the Apple folks, who tend to be litigious. As to the CDMA, it is my understanding from another website that the Nexus One has the CDMA built in, but not activated--mainly due (no doubt) to T-mobile and AT&#38;T (like the rest of the civilized world, such as Europe) being GSM.. Kinda sloppy on your facts there, Cnet!. 

$$;
Pros:. it has everything a phone need it terms of hardware so any problems or features that are missing can be fixed with just an update.. 
Cons:. the phone does not use all of its possible features.. 
Summary:. its the best phone to buy because its a phone that will consistently improve with time. eg if get a 2 year contact it will still be one of the best or the best phone in the market because all google needs to do is a software update if a better phone comes out.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best screen ever. Fastest phone. Amazing. Kills all other android phones. 
Cons:. no physical keyboard. 
Summary:. I love this phone. I retired my g1 for it, and I couldn't be happier. Iphone what?. 

$$;
Pros:. Like the design the touch with voice activated feautre which is cool.The 1 ghz processor makes it faster for all the programms.. there are cool apps like google voice if you have 500 min plan you can always use GV and save your minutes. 
Cons:. Since I am using this phone from last week I like everything on the Nexus one Phone.. 
Summary:. The best is yet to come !!!. Munish Ghai. Realtor. Fresno, CA. 

$$;
Pros:. AMAZING PHONE!!! - beats the iPhone ANY day. 
Cons:. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE - unlocked that is. 
Summary:. Ugh, for most people that can't afford the Nexus One (Unlocked) this is a bummer. I don't want to switch to Tmobile cuz' my AT&#38;T plan is pretty inexpensive and I don't want to switch... great phone tough... I'm gonna hate my life not having it... :/. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Crisp AMOLED Screen, Great Color Saturation, True Black Colors, Super fast 1Ghz CPU makes the phone extremely fast, Latest Android OS, great form factor.. 
Cons:. Battery Life could be better, but it is not bad by any means. Does not support AT&#38;T 3G Network (but EDGE is supported).. 
Summary:. If you're looking for an Android Phone, there is no comparison. Even if youre just looking for a great phone, unless you're on AT&#38;T or need AT&#38;T 3G, this is the phone you want, hands down.. 

$$;
Pros:. Like virtually everything about it. 2.1 is just brilliant and evolving all the time. Very fast processor and the screen makes the i-phone look like an old fashioned black and white tv.. 
Cons:. Was hoping for a slightly better camera like the xperiax10 will have but I suppose I cant have everything.. 
Summary:. One hell of a phone and anyone who has a brain will buy an android phone. The sad fact is that a lot of the reviews on the nexus are done by i-phone loveing fan boys who will never leave apple no matter what and these same idiots havn't even used the nexus but will still slate it because its not apple. If it had apple on the front of the phone the idiots who are slating it would give it top marks.. Well done google and htc keep up the good work.. Updated. on Jan 10, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast fast processor Sleek design, great Pics Definite IPhone killer 100% recommend getting this phone. 
Cons:. Nothing, a little complicated to use but non the less works flawlessly, COME ON APPS Kick it up a Notch. 
Summary:. The phone is sleek slim, modern very fast. Takes great pics, has all the stuff the I phone has and then some.Google has made its mark Apple your in for a war!. 

$$;
Pros:. Built tough &#38; sturdy, feels great in the hand and is extremely thin. Unbelievable screen and colors. Virtual keyboard is fast and responsive. Speech to text is truly amazing, Camera and Video is great, Music player is nice.. 
Cons:. None really aside from maybe a pinch and zoom would of been cool, but in my opinion it's not a big deal at all.. 
Summary:. Pound for pound the Nexus One is the best phone on the market right now, and with Google backing it, I am sure we will be seeing plenty of great things to come, Apple's phone is nice, but outdated in many ways compared to this phone. Great Job Google/HTC in producing the #1 phone out right now.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1GHZ, 512 MB ram, This is a computer people!. 
Cons:. no multitouch yet (It will be here soon). 
Summary:. Love it! Showed It to 2 friends, Iphone guy and Moto Droid Guy. They both were wanting this phone within 15 min of playing with it. This phone is like an Iphone that runs android with affordable service.. If you are afraid of options and choices get an Iphone as they are more simple. If you are someone who likes options and customization THIS phone.. If you are on the fence watch this video of the nexus in a 3d Benchmark test (that it completely Owns). http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/30/nexus-one-trounces-3d-benchmark-gets-caught-in-high-res-photosh/. it runs at almost 30 Frames per second!!! try that on any other phone.. and people who actually dont own this phone need to stop reviewing it. more than half of the bad reviews are Iphone people hating on it without even giving it a chance/testing it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android 2.1 which features free GPS Navigation, improved UI design, better contact management.. Plus still have the customization quality of the Android OS&lt; 2.0 .. 3.7" screen and 720 resolution (&gt; Iphone), shell manages to be thinner than Iphone.. 
Cons:. The Tmobile network, spotty 3G outside of main areas. Wish I had Verizon.. While Android market is growing, many key apps are missing. Chase? Media player is still barebones. Games?. 
Summary:. The pros by far outweigh the cons. Google is a utlra responsive company. Each android version keeps on getting better. Compare that to how long Apple took to get copy/paste and MMS on the IPhone, simple things. The issues with the market and network will get better within a year and this phone should definitely last a good 2 years. And not having multitouch for the Google apps doesn't bother me at all. Call quality and web browsing experience are amazing.. 

$$;
Pros:. its HTC+Google... = GREATNESSNESS!. 
Cons:. design is kind of a turn off... 

$$;
Pros:. - Gorgeous 800 x 480 AMOLED screen.. - Snappy 1Gz Snapdragon processor. - 5 MP Camera, LED flash. - Wireless N. - Removable battery. - Upto 32GB micro SD. - Size/ weight. - Android 2.1. -- Gallery. -- Voice search. -- Google voice. -- Turn by turn navigation. 
Cons:. - Music player can be improved. - Transferring media from computer not as easy as iTunes (although more flexible). 
Summary:. The best phone ever. I have been using it since early december and this is an amazing device. I stopped using my iPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Snappy performance from the snapdragon processor. Fast, multi-tasking, great form factor.. 
Cons:. T-Mobile. Unless you are in a City of 50,000 or more T-Mobile is a weak carrier. They really need to merge with AT&#38;T and put everyone out of their misery.. 
Summary:. Once you get over the paranoia of Google knowing everything about you, this is an incredible phone. Far superior to the Droid. The performance is much faster than the iPhone. Apps run pretty well. Not a multi-media device like the iPhone. I have 20 gigs of songs, movies, podcasts and audiobooks on my iPhone. I see nothing here that can compete. But when it comes to keeping track of your contacts, email and google calendars, this phone is tops. Better display than the iPhone.. I wouldn't call this an iPhone killer. Not just because of the apps availability, although many apps that I use on the iPhone just aren't there for Android yet. It really has more to do with the carrier. If this phone was available on Verizon, it would own the market today. T-Mobile is a sucky carrier. When you're on wi-fi it flies. On the supposed 3g T-Mobile network it bogs down and goes into Edge continually.. Obviously the next gen iPhone will have the amOled screen with a faster processor and availability on the Verizon network. Its going to be interesting to see.. 

$$;
Pros:. GREAT SCREEN,SUPER FAST,WiFi(a,b,g,n),MULTITASKING,CAMERA VERY GOOD,LOOKS VERY GOOD&lt;VERY LIGHT. 
Cons:. cant see one problem yet,dont need pinch zoom,and as far as apps go-how many apps ppl do use?i have in android all i need(dont need 6000 fart apps). 
Summary:. I just love this phone,and dont need it to be or not to be IPhone killer,its just a great phone,thanks Google,Htc and T-Mobile. 

$$;
Pros:. The Android platform needed to move to the 1 GHz Snapdragon with a screen at least as good as the iPhone 3GS. They've done it. Android has arrived. Now on to Tablets, Netbooks, and Car Systems (Ford).. 
Cons:. How to get this in the hands of the average joe, hasn't quite been smoothed out.. 
Summary:. The secret / paradigm of the Android O/S is:. 1) You Sync your Outlook Calendar with iGoogle/Calendar (applet on the Google Lab, &#38; option), then its automatically Sync'd with the Android phone (2-way).. 2) You manage your contacts in Gmail (iGoogle/Gmail) and they are automatically Sync'd with the Android phone (2-way).. Now the missing piece, "the Outlook/Contacts to Gmail/contacts". - A Google Lap applet to sync Outlook Contacts to iGoogle/Gmail/contacts, which would then be automatically Sync'd with the Android phone (2-way).. Its this paradigm,. Microsoft Outlook\(Contacts, Calendar) Sync's with iGoogle\(Contacts, Calendar), which Sync's with Android phone.. Google, is just a little late filling in the missing link.. - Calendar works Great! (love it). - Contacts is a little late to the party.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen is exquisite, processor kicks butt, slim, useable and best of all UNLOCKED! Plus its not anything to do with Apple and their ridiculous Control Freak Policy's... What more do you want. The Iphone has a real fight on its hands now. Camera!. 
Cons:. Not too much... Not as many apps as Iphone and another couple of minor niggles but I suspect all this will be treaked out in a very short time.. 
Summary:. Overall what Google have done is bring out something that people want. Effectively this is the only real player in the Iphone war that has any chance of succeeding and if it does not I will be suprised. One of the biggest problems with the Iphone is its useless camera!!! 3mp and no flash...Useless in all but the best conditions. This camera even though only 5mp is streets ahead and will only get better. The processor is also lightning fast in phone terms and when it is finally used to its full extent will kick ass with well written apps. The screen is faultless and it is slim and light. This phone without a doubt is far superior to the Iphone and I dont see me ever going back to it. I have had quite enough of Apple telling me what airtime I can use and trying at every turn to tie me into using there products. thank you Google for giving me a way out... Bottom line, buy it and throw your Iphone in the bin. (OK dont do that sell it on Ebay and use the money to buy one of these, you will not regret it.. Updated. on Jan 8, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Newest version of android OS. OS is open source. 1ghz cpu. Removeable battery, 5mp camera, amazing screen, google maps, removable storage. Multi-tasking. 
Cons:. Android is still an adolescent when compared to the iphone. No physical keyboard.. 
Summary:. Contrary to what others believe. The Nexus one is not just an iphone clone. I give credit to Apple for making a smartphone that is functional and with the ability to have major 3rd party app support. Without that support, the iphone would have faded just as other popular phones have in the past. But the value and use of the android platform, and the existing iphone, will only is only as good as the third party app developers supporting it. This being the case, the Nexus One has a very bright future. I think people are missing the big picture here. The Nexus one isn?t the thing everyone wants. Sure it has the most powerful processor ever to be endowed upon a phone. But the major component is what is powering this beast, and that is the android OS. Developers can and will now go blow for blow with the iphone and its never ending wardrobe of apps. Apple officially started the game. But with the google android OS being open source, the game has been kicked up to a whole new level.. Updated. on Jan 7, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Great display. Wow. The colors just stand out.. Excellent speed.. I can multitask now (multiple apps at once). 
Cons:. wish it were dual based and ATT 3G capable too, but not holding it against them. I knew what i was buying when I got it.. 
Summary:. I just sold my iPhone. I received my Nexus One last night. Ive played with it all day yesterday and can honestly say my Macbook has a new friend.. I LOVE IT!!!. I was surfing the web, watching videos, visting flash sites with video. I can now watch videos I was not able to with my iPod. I can now listen to Pandora radio and shoot off an email or read my texts. My iPhone would not allow me to do that. It would close my App to open another app.. I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Camera and videos are nice and crisp, voice search and voice text is working great. love the apps. voice navigation, Battery life. Yes my droid can do that iphone. 
Cons:. missing spell check (predictive keyboard) I still hate the touch screen keyboard but adapted with the voice text..

Pros:. super fast,no hanging,3.7 in AMOLED Display,Gmail integration,nice youtube facebook apps,awesome capacitive touch,thin and light,3D games!,good market,good UI,google maps,nice weather and news gadget,very nice search,google voice mail,google speech. 
Cons:. 2D photo processing issues when you zoom,a little bit over saturated colors,LED displays unreadable outdoors if brightness isn't maxed out,no xvid/Divx support out of the box,no tethering. 
Summary:. overall,the only comparable smartphone to iphone 3GS.market could use some work.if you wanna try android and got sick of winmobile,this is you phone.you could consider HTC Desire also if you can pay more cash,but you'll lose google voice search and gain HTC sense UI and a trackpad which maybe less accurate than a trackball sometimes.. Updated. on Apr 21, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. -Great multitasking. -Web Browsing experience. -Camera. -Integration (contacts, gtalk, etc). -Beautiful screen. -Design. -Solid feel, light, durable.. 
Cons:. -4 touch sensitive buttons (functions ok but not great). -on screen keyboard is ok (landscape mode is amazing though). -battery life (not as much as I want it to have). -apps not as many as iphone's but that us unrealistic to expect. 
Summary:. I came from the Iphone 3g. Great boost in speed, the screen is crisper, and the phone doesn't get warm/hot at all.. I've had it for about 2 weeks now, and I'm discovering new stuff everyday. definitely more geared towards the geek/power-user-type but iphone switchers won't be disappointed at all. The OS is definitely better than the iphone's and is comparable to Web OS. I would like to see some more "official" apps come out but through the open source of android you can get apps for free (download them on the internet). Not a lot of accessories at the moment.. I've tested it as a GPS, works great.. Last note would be FLASH 10.1! that's the ONLY thing missing from this phone in my opinion.. I would recommend this phone to anyone switching over from any phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, Sharp and Bright Display, Google integration (particularly Google Voice , and voice-to-text searching and txt'ing.. 
Cons:. I think the voice/sound quality could be better. I am told that my voice often sounds tinny.. 
Summary:. I have owned and used significantly the Blackberry 9800, iPhone, HTC TP2, and I couldn't find a phone that fit my needs as perfectly as the NexusOne. It's closest to the iPhone in terms of use and interface, but much more customizable. While I am an Apple fan (iPods and MacBook Pro), I prefer Google's approach and vision for their handset/android OS.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's fast, the screen is great, the multi touch is nice, the feel is solid, it's fast, it multi-tasks, it syncs, it wifi's, it browses, it apps, it's fast, it emails, it gps's, it maps, it voice searches, oh, did I mention it's fast??. 
Cons:. Will not sync with your Outlook or Livemail contacts, steers you hard towards a Gmail account, have to store your apps on the phones meagre memory (I hear there is a convoluted way around this), screen is pretty pathetic in bright sunlight.. 
Summary:. I love this phone. Did I tell you that it's fast?? Accelerometer, bluetooth, 5mp camera w/flash, REPLACEABLE BATTERY, unlocked, good call quality, app store, MP3 store, up to 32gb storage, beautiful AMOLED screen (but not in bright sun), smart, sexy (looks way better than the IPhone IMO) the O/S is constantly evolving, does video, cool active wallpapers, paired beautifully with my Kenwood DNX8120 Multimedia deck in my car, plays stereo bluetooth over it. I've only had it for two days, so I'm still discovering, but this phone can do ALOT. Nephew has an IPhone 3GS, and this phone is just better. Apple's UI is top of the heap, no doubt, but the Nexus One is no slouch with it's interface, and overall it just performs better and has better features. And you can REPLACE THE BATTERY!!! I get about a day and a half to two on the battery with some some light calling and moderate browsing, with some music playing thrown in. Cant wait to try out the Android App Market to see what's out there. Havent enjoyed a piece of tech this much since I bought my Amiga 1000.. Updated. on Mar 26, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightning fast processor loads everything quickly. Call quality is very crisp on AT&#38;T's 3g network. Ability to scan images to PDFs with the integrated 5 mp camera (through an app). Multitasking is also helpful. Beautiful display and customizable.. 
Cons:. Price is a bit high if you get the unlocked version that can work on AT&#38;T's 3g. Battery drains quickly if all services are turned on (GPS, Sync, etc.). Marketplace is not as vast as App Store.. 
Summary:. The Nexus One is the best phone on the market right now considering performance, display, camera, networks, OS, and apps. The Android platform is developing quality products rapidly, so look for more innovation to come.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, Display - resolution and color, Integrated Google services, (earth, map, mail.....), resonable price, Open source software, Apps. 
Cons:. Touch screen is not that responsible compare with iPhone, alightment of the 4 touch buttom is confused (e.g. you have to touch 2mm above the button instead of the centre of the button), sound quality of the speaker on the back,. 
Summary:. have been using the phone for a month, I found the machine very fast in browsing the internet, running Google earth and 360' street view etc. The photo gallery is really nice, I have no problem in browsing thousand of photos loaded into the SDcard. However, the machine do not play wma audio, no FM radio is not convenience for me, hope that Google will put them in the next update. Still waiting for Flash 10.1 from Adobe.... 

$$;
Pros:. Insanely fast processor, AMOLED screen look beautiful, very high resolution on the screen, very sturdy built phone, runs Android 2.1 with multitouch support, battery life is surprisingly strong, headset sounds wonderful.. 
Cons:. Music player lacks functionality, touch screen can be finicky occasionally, answering phone requires a slide of button rather than touch, ringer volume difficult to hear at times.. 
Summary:. After a two month long affair with the Samsung Behold II, I decided to cast it away for the Nexus One. In hindsight, I should have went with the N1 from the start, but it wasn't available at the time. I'd almost given up on an Android phone. Most of the Android phones out there have some sort of UI attached to them that hinder the phone rather than help them. From this there's only three phones now, G1, Mytouch 3G, and the Nexus One.. My first impression of the phone was the size of the screen, which is larger than most standard screens, and the overall build of the phone. This is definitely a solidly built phone that doesn't feel cheap by any means. Turning it on I knew that AMOLED screens look great, but the N1 took that to a new level. The 480 x 800 resolution really makes the screen clear. Images almost pop off the screen.. After boot up, I was definitely impressed with the overall performance of the phone. The 1 Ghz Snapdragon processor makes navigating the phone lightning quick. I couldn't hardly find a program or function that didn't boot up almost immediately. It's just that good.. The N1 is running Android 2.1, and as of February 2010, has multitouch support. I have to say that anyone who doesn't have an Android phone, they don't know what they are missing out on. Virtually every facet of the layout is customizable. The live wallpapers are wonderful too and run very smoothly. There are 5 home screens on this phone in stock mode, but there are home replacements that allow more. The OS itself is the other half of this phone. While the insane tech specs for this phone could practically sell it to any technophile, the Android OS seals the deal.. Aside from all the Android love, the most basic functions of the phone work nicely. Callers have said that I sounded as though I were on a land line or at least a very good cordless. Most of the phone is fairly intuitive. I don't think I ever had much problem finding functions or changing settings. Of course, I had experience with my Behold II, but I don't think that anyone couldn't figure this phone out with a little playing around.. The multimedia functions of this phone are wonderful, but a bit limited. I found the stock music player to be basic and barebones. There was no EQ settings or any flashy appearance, but it got the job done. Still, it's something that I would like to see Google improve upon with future Android releases. The camera takes decent photos, but there is some noise and graininess to the pictures. The flash, however, works nicely and is very bright. The camera does lack a few options, but this is nothing that can't be improved upon. Video goes all the way up to 720p, but it's only at 20 frames per second so that might cause it to look choppy considering most TVs display at 24 fps.. Some of the other functions like GPS work fairly well. The GPS is a little off, but not terribly so. Wifi was very fast to connect to a hotspot or router. The accelerometer is near instantaneous when used. The auto brightness function is a bit off, but not a real negative.. Most of the negatives with this phone are the weak stock music player, the weak ringer volume which can make the phone difficult to hear in a crowded or noisy room, and answering the phone requires a slide rather than a touch. The sliding is similar to the unlock function (which on this phone is the same) of the iPod or iPhone. I also had some issues with entering text. The N1 virtual keyboard isn't quite as accurate as the iPhone or even the Behold II. Still, it's not terrible by any means.. Battery life on this phone is surprisingly good. I was able to leave Wifi on, turning off background services and GPS, listen to Pandora radio for almost an hour and a half and it only depleted the battery 5% which is very impressive. I imagine with all services and options running, one could get a good days use out of the phone easily.. In conclusion, I'd have to say that virtually any problems with this phone are software related and in the future could be resolved. It's definitely worth it at either $179 or the $530. So you know, I had mine engraved with my name which removes the possibility of sending it back. That's how much I enjoy this phone.. Updated. on May 12, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. The pros of this device are simple. Intuitive OS, beautiful display, smooth interface, solid image capture and video capture, numerous customization options.. 
Cons:. When tapping to compose, the phone doesn't always respond right away. You are limited to only 5 home panels, and the music player was a little plain.. 
Summary:. The bottom line here is that this is a powerful phone that packs nearly everything you want in a phone inside an HTC shell. Tapping, scrolling, apps, Google ingenuity, and so forth sets a new standard on how phones will be produced.. First of all, the 3.7 screen is vivid, clear, and crisp. Everything comes out as pristine.. Web browsing is just as good as it would be on the Iphone 3GS...except faster. I know there was a lot of bitterness and head shaking when the N1 supposedly lacked pinch and zoom, but it's on the phone. I use it, it works perfectly, and if that was truly an issue, it surely was addressed. Now the one thing that does get in the way time to time are the tapping zooming options on the bottom right hand portion of the screen. It just sits there and sometimes can get in the way of images, links, text fields, and so forth. However, it is a very minor problem.. The camera is pretty amazing. It is a 5MP camera, and though it is not as good as my former phone's camera, the Nokia N97, it surely is in the same ballpark. The only complaint I have is the flash sometimes being too bright when taking close-up shots. If someone has fair skin, the N1 flash will make sure that they appear extremely white in the photos saved in your gallery. Otherwise, the N1's camera is equipped with scene modes, zoom, and different coloring options like sepia, black and white, polarization, and so forth.. The video recording is solid. When uploaded to your PC, the resolution and video quality is good enough to watch in any media player in full screen mode without any to little discomfort or annoyance when viewing. Another cool feature when in video mode is that when you are finished shooting a video, you can upload straight to youtube. HOW COOL IS THAT?!?!??!?!?!. Now that mp3 player... It is a decent media player. It is sort of intuitive. However, if you bluetooth a song from your computer, or any external source to your Nex1, it automatically gets put into a category titled bluetooth. I didn't understand this. Why could it not just be put into a dedicated mp3 folder. It's odd. I know people cringe when I say this because it does sound cliche, but it surely is not on par with the Iphone's Ipod player because, well, the Ipod player is just so intuitive. In short, IT JUST MAKES SENSE!. People wonder why the track ball is on the phone? Personally...I like it. In text fields, you can just scroll with that little ball and get to places where you want to go. If I want to delete something in a particular part of a message I am composing, it is much more difficult to get back to that part of the text by pressing the screen with my finger. With the track ball, I just scroll my way to that particular part of the text field, hit backspace, or add a word or two, or what have you. The trackball also lights up periodically if you have an unattended notification, like an email, or a text, or a missed call.. The dedicated keys above the trackball -- back, options, home, and search, are responsive as long as the phone is not laying flat. It seems for the phone to recognize or sense your touch when pressing these keys, contact must be made toward the top of the keys in order for you to get the desired response. I have had some trouble, but not too much with them. However, it can become quite tedious when you just hit and hit and hit and receive no response. This took me a little getting used to, but alas; I am used to it and have little to no issues with these four keys now.. Widgets are available. They are helpful, convenient, and I use four in particular. The 1st, weather and news app. DUH!. The 2nd, Facebook widget. OF COURSE! 3rd, connectivity widget. This widget allows me to power on or off any connection signal on my phone, such as radio, wifi, bluetooth, sync, and also the brightness of the screen. It's just one of those things on the phone that just makes sense. The 4th is the google search widget equipped with voice command. You can search for anything on the web, directions to a desired location, and even desired locations such as restaurants, or movie theaters near you.. Call quality is good. Funny how I get to this toward the tail end...I AM REVIEWING A PHONE! The phone app is what any phone app is. Hit phone, the virtual keypad pops up. There are tabs for your contacts, call log, and favorites. The messaging app is what a messaging app is. Composing messages is easy. One quirk about this messaging app is annoying. With nearly every phone I have used, you can type a contact's name in the TO: Field, and the contact would then be selected, or you are given options of whom you would like to select. Now with the Nex1. You can type in the initial digits of a number and then select a contact, but not their name....Odd...wouldn't you say. It just does not make sense. This is my largest gripe, but it just delays my texting by a significant amount of seconds.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful display. Excellent camera with surprising amazing video. Intuitive navigation. Good sound and phone call levels. Aesthetically impressive. Travels well. Good battery life.. 
Cons:. Seems to have chaotic tactile input when in non standard position (i.e. reading email or checking the morning weather in bed). Case is more difficult than it should be to open and install SIM card or battery.. 
Summary:. All in all and excellent phone/portable computer/ media capture device. I was an early adopter of the G1 and migrating away from the hardware keyboard took a step of faith - not disappointed I did.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast, beautiful screen and very responsive. 
Cons:. Wish there were more accessories and Google wasn't selling it direct. 

$$;
Pros:. Clean and clear phone calls, browsing is great, turn by turn is such an awesome inclusion for free, and most importantly, customization of the home screen (whether original home, home++, or sweeterhome) makes functionality meet creativity. 
Cons:. Native media player is lacking in the sorting department (video is sorted in order they are placed on your phone, no modification that I can find).. 
Summary:. I ordered the phone during the press conference and have had it since the day after. After having it for about a month, I am continually impressed by what it can do. The only thing I think holding it back from the full 5 stars is a media player. I use the app Meridian to do my playing (function over form), but it would be great if Meridian could combine with Gallery to have both form and function. And swype is a must have for all phones going forward. Absolutely changes the game as far as typing is concerned. All in all, would I recommend this to someone trying to decide between an iphone and an n1? Probably depends on the person. The iphone is hands down better in the media department currently (I'm sure there will either be an update from Google to address this, or someone will create a program, etc. at some point). So if you are going to use it just for that, I would recommend the iphone. If you are even slightly technologically inclined, the n1 offers way too much freedom for it to even be close. The n1 is a great smartphone that doesn't change the industry drastically like the original iphone did, but it definitely moves the industry along.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightening fast, wealth of USEFUL applications, customizable to no end, sleek, sexy form factor, integrated Google connectivity and Facebook integration, ridiculous screen, very good call quality. 
Cons:. No native tethering, almost seems delicate in my hands, center of gravity too high on the phone when held in one hand.. 
Summary:. I had a rooted G1 since it came out and was no stranger to the Android experience--both for the good and bad. The rooted aspect of the phone gave me great variety in apps and capabilities, but also made for a less than smooth experience. I briefly had a Nokia N900 which is even LESS user friendly than I had read, and returned it, ordering the Nexus the same day. I am one of the lucky ones who haven't had any 3G connectivity issues, and it's worked seamlessly (Metro NYC area here). The phone FLIES. Everything you open, work on, switch to, or close, happens almost instantaneously. Android 2.1 is extremely flexible and intuitive, and the learning curve is much lower than the Blackberry I had previously or the user-unfriendly Nokia. The battery life thus far has been about average, nothing exceptional, but my G1 required a late day charge to make it through as well. The live wallpapers are nice, but totally useless, I'll probably go back to standard wallpapers once the novelty wears off. Google Navigation is very nice for a free nav system, though it will take you a block or two off on occasion. The apps are generous and useful, even if the App Store is poorly organized and the search function could be more refined there. The "cloud based" voice recognition is nice, but the Google Voice transcribers have a tough time deciphering my NY accent sometimes. Call quality is good to very good, depending on your location. The biggest drawback appears to be the strength--or weakness--of T-Mobile's 3G network. I'm in a major metropolitan area (NYC) and rarely drop to Edge network speeds. I also haven't experienced any of the 3G connectivity bugs reported by numerous N1 owners, so I can't comment to that. Also, the OTA update Google is pushing out this week adds multi-touch to native apps, enhances the Navigation app, and a few other tweaks. Hopefully, Google will eventually add a native tethering app (either via wifi or usb, I could go either way), and will allow apps to be stored on the SD Card. Currently apps can only be stored on the 512 MB of internal memory, although I have quite a few apps on my phone now and still have about 150 MB remaining. I had about a hundred apps on my rooted G1 (which does allow apps saved to the SD Card) and I have learned that I didn't use about 90% of them. So the current storage system for me is fine. I cannot recommend this phone highly enough for anyone looking for a smooth, fast Android experience.. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone is very snappy, the UI is slick and smooth, the AMOLED screen's colors are vivid and blacks are stark, managing contacts is a cinch, the voice-to-text is excellent (still holding my breath for Swype, though!).... 
Cons:. I wouldn't have minded an FWVGA screen, and, seriously, where's the multi-touch?. 

$$;
Pros:. - Super fast. - Flash (surprised me). - Good feel, easy to handle. - virtual keyboard works great. - Email sync. 
Cons:. - lack of accessories, it would have been nice to get a better case/skin.. - Multitouch would be nice but a big issue.. - Expensive but well worth the cost.. 
Summary:. Most definitely the BEST Android phone on the market. I would put this against the Iphone anytime.. 

$$;
Pros:. Display is incredibly bright and sharp. Navigation works well even on AT&#38;T EDGE network.. Camera and media handling are superb. Ditched my iPhone for this. 2.1 software is a major improvement over 2.01.. 
Cons:. No 3G on AT&#38;T. 
Summary:. THE reference phone for Android. Much better than Droid. Others should just use the Google Experience model and be done with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very solidly built, and ridiculously thin compared to other Android phones. Best screen of any Android phone Ive used. Virtual keyboard works much faster than previously (ie-it works well finally). Fast proc, speech to text works amazingly well.. 
Cons:. Sim card replacement requires dropping the battery out of the phone, no dedicated camera button, wish it had a silencer switch like Cliq. 
Summary:. Ive tried every Android phone from every major US carrier with the exception of the Droid Eris, and this phone is very close to a combo between the Droid and Samsung Moment, taking the best from each it seems (except hard keyboard). AMOLED screen, 1 ghz chipset?this phone is extremely fast.. As one who never really cared for soft keys, even i must admit the speed increase really helps the soft keys on the Nexus. Of course with vocal recog, you may never need it, as speech to text is very accurate so far.. Definitely a winner in my book. Time to sell the G1.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has all of the best features of the DROID and the HERO. Feels great in hand, ridiculously fast processor, great design. 
Cons:. Still no multi-touch, still can only save to internal memory. 
Summary:. Hands-down the best Android phone on the market. I loved the Moto Droid for its large screen and speed, but also liked the ERIS/Hero for it's small form-factor. In my oppinion, the Nexus One is a great hybrid of both of these phones...and is a lot faster to boot. I've only had it for a few hours now, but I'm already in love.. 

$$;
Pros:. froyo changed everything on the nexus.. -hotspot and tethering. -save apps to sd. -faster browsing (without flash). -flash. -better video recording and camera. 
Cons:. -battery life. -the T-Mobile Network. 
Summary:. the phone is great since updating to froyo 2.2, havent seen anything bad yet. only if the phone came in black.. 

$$;
Pros:. With regards to the body of the Nexus, it?s well crafted, sleek and just fits perfectly into your hands. It has a large display screen that is rich, classy, vibrant, colorful and lively. And what?s best;- it?s slightly larger than the iPhone?s screen. 
Cons:. The music quality of the Nexus is not all that great? I know this is a bit unfair as I?m addicted to the iPod.. 
Summary:. The Nexus One is one top-notch phone and certainly has an upper hand over the iPhone in several areas as discussed above. Now having read the Google Nexus One review, please head for the Nexus One Google store and get hold of this masterpiece.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing phone! I wish that those who have written many of these reviews would explore the market more. Android is known for giving the user the power to tweak and personalize their device. At least 70% of complaints can be fixed by an apparently.. 
Cons:. Most of my gripes can be corrected with with apps or a software update. Review below. 
Summary:. Pros continued: I am with T-Mobile and coming off of a Cliq. The internet, even on edge, is FAST! The screen is beautiful with brighter brights and rich darks. I am a huge fan of the pinch to zoom. Talk to text (for search, texts, etc) makes this feel like so much more than a phone. This is a true smart phone. The sensitivity is great, even with a screen protector. Even without tweaking, straight out of the box, this is an amazing piece of hardware. I think the camera is exceptional! The phone also feels very sturdy and well-put-together, without that clunky brick feel.. Cons continued: I do not have any problems with the hardware itself. I would suggest flash 10.1 and sensitivity around the edges for a software update. Things that can be corrected through the market (for me) include, keyboard-prefer a nicer one, pic editing (picsay is great for that), more attractive Widgets and clock (beautiful Widgets is my favorite), and adding a few Apps to improve on an already wonderful functionality. The only use for the track ball so far is for scrolling through long-winded reviews. ; ). If you are coming from another Android phone, this will surpass all your expectations. To those who worry about the price, (even though it is worth it) look at any unlocked NICE smart phone. The price is comparible to most. To those who have never used Android, you have the power to tweak and personalize most of the software. Please research it more and educate yourself of all Android has to offer. To everyone, please blame your carrier for your connectivity problems, not the Nexus. Oh, and go buy the Nexus One! Lol. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, slim, high pixel camera, text to talk adds safety to drivers. 
Cons:. Google did not include tethering application, did not include a sim card manager application to delete or add numbers to sim, did not include all languages (arabic), phone speaker quality is poor. Ring tones are not loud even though it's set on high.. 
Summary:. I love text to talk. Missing two critical applications (tethering &#38; sim card management). Needs improvement on speakers. It would have been nice to include two sim cards too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Live wallpapers makes the iPhone look like a boring cousin. The large screen is beautiful. Android 2.1 is amazing and incredibly flexible. The 5MP camera is awesome. The phone is FAST and the Android Market is packed with solid apps.. 
Cons:. The black borders of the screen need multi-touch tuning. It causes the touchscreen to become unresponsive when fleshy thumbs touch it accidentally. The 3g antenna is horrendously bad on T-Mobile. Hopefully, the Verizon and AT&#38;T versions won't suffer.. 
Summary:. This phone is sexy, sturdy, incredibly customizable and pretty much does everything without having to "jailbreak" or "root" the phone. I've used the Droid, the iPhone 3GS, the Palm Pre, and the Storm. The Nexus One hands down is a better experience- well, except for the 3g issues. Even with the Google update that was supposed to fix the problem, nothing got better. T-Mobile is not the best carrier, and with a weak antenna that just compounds the problem. I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the 3g issue.. 

$$;
Pros:. actually you CAN store apps on the sd if you a: root the device b: install via side-load from a lap-top or pc.. 
Cons:. despite subpar speakerphone on the nexus, Loving gesture search,google earth etc and that beautiful screen. have apps installed on my nexus memory card device is not rooted. rooting allows app storage when downloading from android market.. 
Summary:. I love that as an open platform. you can install market and non-market apps...no device is perfect. im in the wireless biz and this device is one of the best ive ever used.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. It's very nice to have everything like gmail, google talk, and maps at your fingertips wherever you go.. 2. Great design- feels great in the hand and definitely feels very well built.. 
Cons:. 1. Sometimes mine has a problem switching the keyboard from portrait mode to landscape mode.. 2. Poor battery life- This could be attributed to the fact that this is my first smartphone and am upgrading from about a 5 year old Motorola phone.. 
Summary:. I have had the phone for roughly 2 weeks now and wanted to wait to give it a review until I had a good grasp on the phone.. Attractiveness is not necessarily a huge deal for me but I love the look of this phone. It looks like what it is- a workhorse. No frills, nothing.. The design is very nice as well with very utilitarian aspects. the volume rocker is in the perfect place for adjusting the volume while talking. The four "buttons" on the front don't get in the way while navigating through the phone. The only design feature I don't like is the trackball. It just feels cheap and I am not very accurate when using it. I find the trackball is necessary to use when correcting my typing (more on the keyboard later), but when navigating to my mistake I keep jumping to the wrong place. Some people have complained about using these buttons because they won't register their touch- to them all I can say is HIT THE BUTTON! Its pretty easy, and I'm not having troubles at all.. The user-interface and web is very intuitive and smooth. Scrolling through the web pages, menus, etc. is very smooth and is not jumpy at all. Some webpages do have a problem with scrolling though, but I think its because there may be too many flash animations to load. Its fine on ESPN or your favorite news source.. A lot of reviews I have read complained about the on screen keyboard being not accurate. I have decided that complaint comes up because they have used another smartphone extensively. This is my first smartphone and I have no problems using the keyboard in landscape mode and am able to type quickly with both thumbs. The keyboard in portrait is another animal though. I have huge hands so I can only type with one thumb and very slowly because I have to use the "edge" of my thumb to type. Sometimes the phone will go through a fit with me while using the keyboard and it won't change from portrait to landscape mode when I turn the phone. Very frustrating!!!. As far as the camera on the phone I was very impressed with it. It took great pictures that were clear both on the phone and the computer screen. The same goes for capturing video.. Battery life is lacking on the device. If I am using it constantly surfing the web, talking on the phone, texting, etc. the battery lasts about 6-8 hours (I haven't exactly timed it). I thought my 5 year old Motorola Nextel phone was bad because I needed to charge it every 24 hours. But 6-8 hours is bad. I guess I have to invest in another charger for work.. To sum things up, I highly recommend this phone. Like I said its a workhorse that gets things done, but stay close to a charger.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks like T-Mobiles MyTouch.. 
Cons:. Battery life could be better.. 
Summary:. "Like other Android phones, the Nexus One forces you to store apps on the internal memory"...not true, I store all my apps on the 16GB memory card of my T-Mobile Mytouch.. 

$$;
Pros:. The flexibility of a touch-screen phone and its available apps make for a huge step up. The phone is much easier than a Blackberry to configure (except for Exchange). Sound quality is good. From the case to the screen, the phone looks good.. 
Cons:. You can't get full Exchange sync yet. The phone takes a minute to boot. It's slippery in the hand. Some controls are balky, and answering a call takes a finger swipe instead of a simple button push.. 
Summary:. I moved up from a Blackberry Pearl Flip (8220), so the Nexus is a big change. The first thing I noticed as I started to configure Nexus was its beautiful screen. Then I was grateful for well-designed menus, and the Android Market which let me add functions very quickly and easily.. I knew that Exchange integration would be tough, had done enough research to settle on Nitrodesk's Touchdown app, which loaded and immediately started pulling down mail, contacts, calendar and task information (no notes, though). It took around 20 minutes to get everything loaded over WiFi.. It's great to have a large, bright screen. Web pages are readable now, though the reviewers are right about the need for multi-touch (Apple's pinch-and-zoom system where you can expand, contract and re-orient images or web pages by using two fingers at a time) - the Nexus One's browser's zoom control is awkward.. The phone's settings menus are very well done. Call forwarding is easy to configure (at least on T-Mobile). Some configuration choices are mis-placed (the Google Voice application's settings control whether GV or your carrier controls the outgoing calls, which can lead to confusion).. Android Market makes it easy to download new apps, and the apps are useful (from Kayak, to Fandango, to Google's Sky application for identifying constellations). Be careful with exotic VOIP apps, though - I had to rebuild the phone after one of them corrupted the phone's basic calling functions.. Simple telephone calls are tougher than they should be. To answer you have to swipe your finger across the screen - tougher than just stabbing a button, and you'll probably miss a couple of calls. To call is easy enough, but it's not as fast as hitting a Blackberry call button and starting to type a name in the text box. There is no classic telephone ring tone - just a bunch of hip-to-goofy tones that you may not feel comfortable hearing in conservative business meetings.. Don't get this phone if you want full Exchange compatibility and the most efficient way to make phone calls and read email. Blackberry is better for these things. But if you want to use more of the Internet while on the go, and especially if you find yourself relying on lots of Google web applications (Picasa, Gmail, Voice, etc.) the Nexus One is a good way to expand your mobile computing power..

$$;
Pros:. Snapdragon, Display, stock android, feature rich, removable battery, beautiful display. 
Cons:. T-Mobile 3G, stock android, poor customer support and updates. 
Summary:. I actually like the stock Android minus the HTC sense UI. Moving between applications or home screens is smooth and fast, call quality has been very good and no one has had a problem hearing me. Speaker phone is "Okay" I have seen worse that is for sure. The phone is fast... I think Android 2.1 needs refinement as it's not as polished as the iPhone OS (but I do like Android better than iPhone OS) T-Mobile 3G is spotty at my home. I live 25 miles south east of Nashville, TN... We do have 3G service in my area but it's spotty. My phone flips between 3G and Edge constantly at home but yet my short time with an HD2 held and kept a 3G signal. Same at the T-Mobile store... All their phones (and they are 3 or 4 miles from my house) hold on a 3G signal while the Nexus One kept switching to Edge. Now when I go downtown Nashville, TN the phone picked up and held a 3G signal the whole time.. Even in and out of buildings full 3G and amazing speeds. The stock android keyboard can be buggy as well. I have hit buttons and it's picked up the letter next to it. the "Home, Menu, Back and Search" buttons across the bottom you have to hit a hair above them not directly on the icon. The track ball is pointless... It blinks when you have notifications but using it to scroll is awkward since you have a large 3.7 inch touch screen to just touch what you want to do.... the feel of the phone in your hand is awesome... Before every hooking it up to service or even turning it on right out of the box it had a great feel and balance in your hand. Overall a pretty good device... Android 2.1 needs some work and the Verizon/Sprint CDMA/EVDO version's can't come out fast enough.. Can't wait to see how the Verizon/Sprint models hold a 3G signal.... T-Mobile just has spotty coverage and even AT&#38;T's 3G map is limited compared to Verizon and Sprint (Who use the same technology and roam on each others networks) With out the 3G problems with T-Mobile I would give this phone 4 - 4.5 stars.. Not really the phones fault T-Mobile is spotty but when an HD2 made by the same company and operating on the same network can hold and keep a 3G signal there has to be an issue with the antenna or software on the phone..... 

$$;
Pros:. - Awesome screen (able to adjust the brightness on the fly). - Sturdy design. - Great camera. - Ton of options for personalizing. - GPS directions...bye bye GARMIN. 
Cons:. - Touch screen sometimes doesn't recognize you are touching it. - Voice recognition software only works with 3G, not for Edge or lower.. - Battery seems to die pretty quick (I never had a smartphone before so I don't know how it compares to others). 
Summary:. I am happy with this phone. Google was quick to implement updates (recent update allowed pinch to zoom feature). I'm not a big fan of touchpads but I got used to it am able to text almost error free now. The auto fill function is awesome too when texting. Instead of just throwing a word in there, it gives you a number of options below the actual text field. It's tough to beat the price and I would most certainly recommend this phone to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. wifi, multi tasking, speed, mic display. 
Cons:. unable to pinch display. 
Summary:. Please tell me why, an unlocked Nexus One with no carrier, is or is not able to make and receive phone calls via a wifi internet connection on Skype or Gizmo!! If so can it use Google Voice to record or redirect calls.. It has wifi, can multi task and a mic..

Pros:. Nice Size, Open OS, Large Sharp Screen. 
Cons:. Poor Battery life, Buggy even with Multi-Touch, Andriod App's need some work. 
Summary:. I have been using a IPhone 3G &#38; 3GS for about two years and I decided to try a Nexus One and hear are my thoughts after two weeks of using the phone as my primary communications device. I was using an unlocked version on my AT&#38;T network (Only EDGE supported). I liked the large and very sharp screen which is much better then the IPhone, I also liked the fact I can set-up the phone to look and function like I want, which the IPhone lacks in that area. I received the Multi-Touch upgrade which I could not have lived without and it worked smooth like my apple device. The internet connection was quick for the EDGE 2G network because of the speed of the Nexus one which impress me allot. Allot of positives for a new model phone from a well known company.. Here is what I did not like about the phone and this is based on my experience only. The battery life is not up to par for the money they are getting for the unlocked version from Google. I had several screen freeze problems when I was opening applications and I noticed it more when I enabled the live backgrounds compared to the static ones. I had several of my clients tell me the call quality was terrible compared to my IPhone and would always ask me if i had changed phones.. I used Android apps that where similar to ones I used on the IPhone so I could make an honest comparison and I found most of them where OK, but they always had things that fell short of the apps from the ITunes store. I always hated the fact that I am tied to ITunes for backing up and getting updates, but I always know the interface works and the support I get from Apple is superior to the half ass support I got from Google.. I honestly think that Google should have done a little more homework and maybe talked to some dedicated IPhone users like myself and asked us what we would like changed and they would have a winner compared to a device that has some serious issues and is priced way to high for an economy that has been changed to a value added consumer that is going to look at every touch screen device and the first words that come out of my mouth is "how does it compare to the IPhone".. Apple has become a 50 billion dollar company because they build great devices that consumers want. Mac PC's, IPods and IPhones. Go into an Apple store sometime and I can assure you it will never be empty. Steve Jobs has surrounded himself with folks who design great products and are ahead of the curve.. Sometimes I think these companies who attempt to build a "super phone" get they're input from a bunch of techno dweebs who only use the thing to play music and games and never use it for what it was designed for, a phone and PDA device. Oh well.. Those are my thoughts and opinions, I hope it helps. 

$$;
Pros:. Has all of the benefits of an android phone, nice design, faster processor than eris.. 
Cons:. Still no bluetooth activated voice dialing (come on - too many states are hands free. How could you ignore a basic phone feature.) Also, additional memory card does not make up for the fact that apps can only be stored on the internal memory.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen! OLED is beautiful.. 
Cons:. No support for synchronizing with MS Outlook Calendar and Note. When will these cell phone manufacturers get it through their heads that there are those of us who want a real all-in-one device that can perform for work and play.. 

$$;
Pros:. VERY BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY, FASTEST PROCESSOR AND LOADED WITH A LOT OF USEFUL FEATURES.. 
Cons:. LACK OF MULTITOUCH, LACK OF OUTLOOK SUPPORT,LACK OF DUAL MODE CAPABILITIES.. 
Summary:. What google tried to do with this device is to set the standard of what android is capable of doing. I think google got frustrated with how repeatedly, each of the manufacturers has missed the mark, either in hardware or software. If you are trying to bring something that will kill any existing devices it has to be a complete knock out. I have never used an iphone, but once my boss, who uses one told me "it's unreal what this device can do". I use Windows mobile phones and have jumped on each new one that has been dubbed the iphone killer. I like the freedom of customization WM devices give me but i am increasingly frustrated with them. I am now on the AT&#38;T Tilt 2 which was also dubbed iphone killer but alas far from being that. The Nexus has come very close and I hope things will pick up from here moving forward. Google has raised the bar and now I know I am very close to ditching WM and moving on.It is sad that WM devices are even not being mentioned when it comes to comparing the Nexus. I believe the end is near for WM unless something really dramatic happens on that platform. for now it is a 2 way race between android devices and iphone. As I said in the beginning for anything to be an iphone killer it will have to bring a knock punch into the ring.So far non of the existing devices has done that.the droid came very close and also missed the mark with hard ware. A boxer who fights a reigning champion will always loss if he tries to win on points. Well done google now let the game begin.Thank iphone for setting the standard of mobile devices. The iphones days are numbered unless apple can begin to free it up a little. For now I will stay with my Tilt 2 on the worst network ever, until the day I will receive a complete freedom of phone and network choice with one device. Thank you for reading.. 

$$;
Pros:. This was my first smart phone, and I was very impressed by the ease of use, and the display of the phone. The camera is fantastic, and the integration with google apps makes everything seamless. I was impressed by the touchscreen keyboard.. 
Cons:. Within months, my touchscreen began to fail, and my husband's power button failed. On both occasions, we experienced terrible customer service. Repair takes weeks. When you pay over $500 for a phone, you should expect to get the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing screen. 1ghz snapdragon processor. android 2.1. google navigation. screen customization and widgets. 
Cons:. 3g for att wasnt good on this phone wouldnt handoff to edge properly just sit in 3g with zero bars calls still garbled some. lower soft keys dont work well. screen can be misaligned at time. earpiece volume too low. speakerphone volume is tinny and low. 
Summary:. I sold mine after 2 weeks for the negative reasons listed above it really doesnt live up to the hype and the fact everything from warranty and buying the actual phone has to be done on line is pretty sorry..i bought a htc desire and its truly what the N1 should have been..the n1 was just a mistake plagued with bugs and software and hardware issues. 

$$;
Pros:. Text-to-speech, GTalk and Google voice Connectivity.. 
Cons:. 1.) Email client - you can't forward the email with attachment. you can not search the mails in your mailbox, you can not see the custom folders of yahoo or hotmail.. 2.) 3G Speed - it only works on t-mobile 3G and not compatible with at&#38;t 3g.. 
Summary:. I would say that the phone is over pricy and after paying this price you won't even get the basic things like email client and 3G speed(AT&#38;T).. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast processor, good screen size.. 
Cons:. Doesn't sync to outlook. No multi-touch.. 
Summary:. First, let me state that I do not own an iPhone. I own an original Samsun Instinct, almost two years old. I've kept my Instinct this long because it does what I need it to do (phone, text, email, twitter, facebook, etc) and it does it well. It may not be pretty, but at least I am not paying out the nose for the thing.. We all thougt google was going to revolutionize the smartphone industry in a similar way Apple did. I was literally frothing at the mouth in anticipation for the Nexus One. This was going to be the phone that changes everything.. It isn't.. The phone is a good smartphone... That's it. There is nothing special about it at all. The ability to purchase it without a contact? You can do that with any phone. Get it unlocked? You can unlock any phone you buy, you just need to jump through some hoops with your service provider.. Where is the innovation? Where is the Google I know and love that prides itself on high quality, cheap, open products? This phone is exactly the same as the HTC hero except for a slightly larger screen and faster processor.. What is all the fuss about?. Needless to say, I put my phone into the mail today to return it to Google. I am going back to my Instinct for now... And will patiently wait for something grand from someone.... 

$$;
Pros:. -Amoled screen. -SD Card. -Tethering. -Multitasking. 
Cons:. -Poor Build Quality. -Controls are the bottom of screen are often non-responsive. -Battery Life. -Fragile. 
Summary:. I bought the phone as a replacement to my iphone 3g that was ruined by water damage. I can say that's its not an I-Phone but a decent smart phone.. After using this phone for four days the screen shattered after a fall from a counter top at work onto a commercial carpeted floor something that had happened countless times to my I-Phone without an issue.. Another thing about the phone is the os. It's nice in some ways, like customization, but it lags from time to time when typing. Another issue that bothers me is the delay between when you add a number to your phone book to the time it takes to appear in your phone book. It has taken several hours for me.. The bottom line is that given the option I would go back to the I-Phone 3g, and I can not wait for my I-Phone 4 to come in on the 24th..

Pros:. Screen is big, clear and bright.. Slim, fairly attractive profile.. Android OS not polluted with manufacturer BS like Motoblur or similar.. 
Cons:. Worst feature: on-screen keyboard is teeth-grindlingly bad. Essentially unusable.. Google support, both online and over-the-phone, is poor.. Battery life is awful.. Hilariously overpriced.. Unexplained screen freezes.. 
Summary:. I'm a big fan of the Android OS, especially now that the number of apps is catching up to the iPhone. This is an Android phone. Other than that, not too much good to say about this product.. I had been using the first Android phone, the G1, for about a year and a half, so I expected considerable improvements with the Nexus One. I was disappointed. It is actually slower, and there seems to have been an actual de-evolution in design functionality. For instance, to get to the phone screen on the G1, you press the green phone button from any screen: one click, less than one second. To get to the phone on the N1, you press the Home button, wait a second or two while it loads the Home screen, press the on-screen phone button, and wait a second or two while the phone screen loads. Alternatively, hold down the Home key for about a second, and a screen of recently-used apps pops up. If the Phone button happens to be there, press that and wait while the Phone screen loads. Two clicks, 3-5 seconds to even initiate your call.. Other problems include battery life (this is a "mobile" phone only in that you can carry it from charging point to charging point if you are a moderate to heavy user, as I am); Speaker phone (tin can-and-string quality); Google "support" ('nuff said); price; and a very, very, very unfortunate tendency towards inexplicable screen freezes that require a restart or even popping the battery out. Phone &#38; 3G reception are spotty, and while this may be partially a T-Mobile problem, it's worse with this phone than my old T-Mobile G1.. The biggest problem, however, is the keyboard. This is the real reason not to buy this phone.. I have used the keyboard that comes loaded on the phone, and three others that I downloaded from the app store. They are all unusably bad. Screen sensitivity is poor, so it's very easy to push the keys adjacent to the character you want. Basic punctuation marks like apostrophes, dashes and colons require going into sub-menus or squinting at the very tiny, faint alt-characters. The autocomplete feature is extremely frustrating. For example, trying to type ".com" results in an autochange to ".m" for some reason, and working around it takes many seconds.. I just composed test messages on my G1 and the Nexus One. G1: 13 seconds. Nexus: 38 seconds. I am an experienced, savvy mobile user, and I've had a month to practice on the Nexus,so these results are not due to a learning curve.. Both Google and T-Mobile support folks have the same suggestion to fix the problem: download and use the Swype keyboard. Unfortunately,**SWYPE IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE ANDROID MARKET, AND THE SWYPE COMPANY HAS NO PLANS TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE.** In short, even T-Mobile and Google concede that the stock keyboard isn't viable, and their proposed solution is to download a third-party solution that you can't actually get. Even if it were available, however, Swype isn't a magic bullet, and has signficant drawbacks of its own: for one thing, it essentially requires you to learn an entirely new style of text entry to get speeds almost as good as a standard physical keyboard.. Summary: if you have too much cash lying around, don't mind waiting through freezeups, aren't planning on making phone calls, and don't think you'll ever need to enter text, the Nexus One might be a good choice for you. Otherwise, stay far, far away from it.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast. very nice design.. 
Cons:. very weak speaker. low volume. looks good. but not very well build for the price. the $70.00 fake i phone is build well than nexus. HTC gets 0 quality control. Google gets an A for covering negative comments on its u tube page.. 
Summary:. Had the phone for less than 24 hrs. Made one call. I had to ship it back for repair. because i couldn't hear or talk with the phone on my ear. i had to use the speaker. forget about finding negative comments or writing one on U Tube's nexus page. if it's negative, it gets deleted.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent screen, navigation, fast/responsive, interactive widgets better than iPhone icons, Gmail/Google Apps synch works well, multiple Exchange inbox support. 
Cons:. Fatal flaw is lack of Exchange Calendar support, hopefully they will add soon. It's a bit slippery in the hands..a good shell should solve that. 
Summary:. If you are on gmail or google apps and on T-Mobile this is a smokin fast device with a great UI. It's not a simplistic at the iPhone but you can do just about anything with it. But if you need Exchange calendar support, you should wait to see if Google adds it. There are a couple of decent add-ons out there. I used TouchDown on my G1, but unless they improved since the last time I used them, I will be going back to my unlocked iPhone on Tmo and waiting for the HD2 or other superphone to come out, preferably one that supports multiple Exchange accounts as I use Exchange both at work and on client sites.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pretty - like a sexy person with no other qualities. 
Cons:. Touch screen loses calibration and there is no way to recalibrate - remove the battery. Reception is bad for bluetooth devices - and to connect - remove the battery. No voice dialing through bluetooth and phone constantly locks up _ must remove battery. 
Summary:. Not only do you have to remove the battery constantly to make the phone work - T-mobile blames it on HTC (or google) and HTC (or google) blames it on T-mobile. The wifi is spotty and the fact that the touchscreen gets unresponsive makes it useless.. ***Insert lots of profanity here***. Going back to the iphone as soon as practical.. 

$$;
Pros:. The maps feature on this phone is great.. 
Cons:. In 1 month the wi-fi stopped working. The sreeen is difficult to see when outside, even when on full brightness. Does not sync with Outlook calendar.. 
Summary:. This phone is not worth the hype. I paided over $500 for a phone that is not working in just 1 month. The only option is to be without a phone for 2 weeks while they repair it or swap it for a used (a/k/a refurbished) phone. What a joke. Buy a phone from one of the stores, you will at least get customer service at the store. Dealing with Google on troubleshooting the phone is terrible. I was so excited about this phone an it is an extreme let down. When the phone works it is a fun phone. But, if it does not work, it is not worth it. My recommendation is that you don't take a chance on it, unless you have $500 to waste.. 

$$;
Pros:. You can make phone calls with it. 
Cons:. Too many to list...but for one the call time lags. Speed is not speedy at all. In fact when going from one photo to the next...it's VERY slow.. 
Summary:. I would not reccomend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. AMOLED screen, fast processor, Android. 
Cons:. Bad 3G connection, non existent customer support. 
Summary:. I have been using the phone for 2 weeks now and here is my in depth review.. The Android software is really great, easy to use,very responsive and you could access things easily. I fell in love with it from the moment I start using it. The processor is the fastest you could get currently so menus and apps are very responsive. AMOLED screen is bright and great to look at. But forget about using it outdoor in the bright sun. I tried using it in a cab on a bright day and I could not even send a text message correctly due to the glare. You could barely see anything on the screen. This is not due to poor design of the phone as it affects all AMOLED screen. The learning curve is a bit steeper but once you get the hang of it, you would grow to like it. I have been using the iPhone for 3 years now and I dare to say this has the potential to be an iPhone killer. The phone supports multi touch. It is just that multi touch does not work on any of the built in apps like pictures or web browser. I install dragon browser and immediately I could perform multi touch. So it depends on the app you install if it supports multi touch. By default, the NEXUS One has multi touch bulit in.. To really enjoy the full potential of the phone, it is best that you have google account. You cannot sync emails, contacts or calendars with Microsoft Outlook. Everything is sync from the google servers. There are no software to sync your music or photos so this has to be done manually by transferring it to the included SD card. So you have to keep deleting songs, videos and photos manually each time. But if you have a google account, everything is done automatically. You contacts would be sync with your gmail account. If your friends are also using Gmail, it would show you an icon to say that they are on line for chatting. Nice. Photos are sync with your Picasa account. Nothing is actually stored on the phone itself and this is what they mean by cloud computing.. The problem I have is with the 3G connection. It does not hang on the signal at all and keeps switching between 3G and 2G. Once it switches, you lose any phone conversation you are having. At home, I could not last more than 2 minutes on the phone before it gets cut off. I switch my SIM card to and iPhone and also to SE Aino and both phones has no problems at all at the same location. They display 3 bars of 3G signal.. Even out on the street,the 3G signals could never seem to hold on for long. Worst part is,once it switches to 2G, you would have problems connecting to the internet,sending SMS or even making calls. MMS does not seem to work either. Tried contacting Google but it seems the support e-mail is answered by a computer every time. The reply e-mails gave recommendations on things to try that I do not even ask and 99% of the time, you do not get any reply. No one can tell you how to set the settings to get MMS working or GPRS working. You have to do your own search on the forums across the net. For such a potential phone, this ruins the experience for me and I would never get another HTC or google phone.. If you have a very strong 3G signal at home and workplace and only moves around this area,I say buy this phone. The Android interface and it's potential are truly amazing. But if you now even have only 3 bars of 3G connection with the current phone, forget about buying it. 90% chances you would have lost connection with this phone. It would cause lots of frustration.. 

$$;
Pros:. Will be a great phone but with the 3G connectivity issue you cannot rate. 
Cons:. Hundreds of complaints on 3G connectiviety. I live in a strong TMobile 3G area and have had a 30 second connetion to the 3G network. This is not a TMobile issue but a phone issue, TMobile 3G works just fine on the G1 phone. 
Summary:. Too early to rate until 3G issue is fixed. 

$$;
Pros:. Feels good in the hand. Everything seems to work as advertised.. 
Cons:. There's little to get excited about. If the iPhone didn't exist or had never been updated, this would be worth considering. It's a nice first effort but there's just no sizzle here. It's as though it's a year or two old right out of the box.. 

$$;
Pros:. I really like the operating system, and it seems reasonably fast and responsive to the touch, etc.. 
Cons:. Everything breaks. I have taken very good care of this phone, but in the four months I have had it, the power button has failed, the battery life is terrible, and the camera stopped working. I reset to factory and no help.. 
Summary:. Generally disappointed. I would be better off with my old school flip phone and a laptop because any reliance you build up to this phone winds up being a setup for disappointment. The apps were much more likely to have technical deficiencies than Iphone apps I had grow accustomed to. The primary problem comes from major parts of the camera just breaking altogether.. If this phone just had the stamina to not break constantly, I would be really happy with it, I think. I am a big fan of Google generally, but I will stick to their email and voice services, avoiding their hardware, which seems poorly conceived and poorly manufactured. I will be going back to AT&#38;T and the Iphone.. 

$$;
Pros:. For the price I paid for. I expected a much better phone. I can not access my favorite websites because this phone doesn't support Arabic. I regret buying it. 
Cons:. I expected a better product from googleThe touchscreen is mediocre the phone seems slow sometimes. Doesn't support Arabic. poor apps library. 

$$;
Pros:. The aps are very nice but not worth the problem.. 
Cons:. It looks cheap and the lines are not well adjusted together.. 
Summary:. Dont buy and you will have to pay 45 to return the crap.. 

$$;
Pros:. Software is brilliant. And Android market is flooded with useful free software.. 
Cons:. The hardware does not match up with the brilliance of the software. The trackball technology is ancient. It deserves a trackpad, like the new Blackberry's. The touchscreen is not very responsive, especially when you want the keypad up to type message. 
Summary:. Google must not rely on HTC to build the hardware. It must take control, like Apple, to keep quality in check.. Nexus will never ever be an Apple killer. But Windows Mobile better watch out.. But for the Blackberry, no phone was wirelessly syncing Outlook notes, not even products from the stable of Microsoft itself, like Microsoft Exchange, which is a very sad and frustrating thing for most business users. Nexus takes the frustraton further by syncing only contacts and mail from Exchange. What was Google thinking? There are applications available at Android Market to fill in this gap. But they do not work too well.. Rather than focus on Outlook compatibility, Google wants us to move away from Microsoft and move into its own online applications like Google calendar and contacts, for wireless syncing with the phone. But a good alternate to Outlook notes is still missing in the stables of Google applications. Moreover, a single desktop application to manage and sync contents from the phone to the computer to the Internet would be the most useful thing, and would make life of Android users much easier.. 

$$;
Pros:. Texture of back is easier to keep in your hand. Less resistance to scratches.. 
Cons:. The platform or operating system is buggy and glitchy. Not solid like the iPhone 3GS. It lacks the 100,000 applications available at the Apple iPhone App. store. It is very rudimentary! Very basic and for the price point is not worth the money.. 
Summary:. I think this phone could have potential. But as long as other companies are making the body of the phone and the OS by another, it will continue to be glitchy and slow to respond to commands.. The difference to the iPhone is the company that programs the operating system also designed the body of the phone itself. This is also why the yearly growth rate of PC's is 2.8% and Macs built by Apple grew at an astonishing 16.8%. If you do the math, eventually Apple and it's Mac OS X platform will be the predominant computer in use. This comes on the heals of Microsoft not doing anything to innovate in the space. The Nexus suffers from the same fate as all MS based PC's, it needs to be built by the same company that programs what it will do.. In my opinion this phone feels good in the hand but the overall performance is slow, glitchy, (the screen blanks out as you switch programs.) Its just not half of what the iPhone is. Try again HTC. You keep coming out with these iPhone copies but the patents of the iPhone, that protects the iPhones unique set of applications.. Updated. on Jan 25, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing to like. 
Cons:. almost everything, no customer support.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the sleekness of the phone.. 
Cons:. The substance of the phone is horrible. I have listed a few things wrong with the phone:. 1.It drops call all the time. 2.It is not fast by 3G standards. 3.The phone freezes up, has a mind of its own!. 4.And did I mention it drops call insanely.. 
Summary:. I would go with the Driod by Verizon, never dropped a call.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not much, but the processor is fast and the screen is vibrant and crisp.. 
Cons:. The App Store selection is too small and sometimes the phone doesn't respond for a second when viewing pictures; could be a software or hardware problem with this phone specifically.. 
Summary:. The Phone was nothing compared to the iphone and it doesn't have that many useful features.. 

$$;
Pros:. What i like.... They sync facebook pics and info with your contact and Multiple apps run at once.. 
Cons:. Wifi doesnt stay connected.. My Blackberry pics up the wifi at greater distances than the nexus one. ONLY 5 screens to organize your apps. Touch screen doesnt work 1/6 of the time - Not sensitive enough. Contact notes are only a few lines long. 
Summary:. The sound (ie music or speaker phone) is thin or tinny making it hard to understand the person talking. the ear piece is hard to hear with the phone up to my ear.. The software navigation buttons are not intuitive(ie back or settings). It takes two bottons to unlock/wake the phone to use it - Iphone and itouch only one. Compass is not true north no matter how many times i "wave my phone in a figure eight".. Phone runs hot to the touch on the back bottom of the phone. Im worried the protector case i have on order is going to make it worse. When you close an app it still keeps running. No option to "keep on or completely close" which runs your battery down fast. Charged the batter for 8+ hours over night and it was only 3/4 charged. The phone ran down in 4hrs the next day. May have been a bad batter, I don't know but it never reached 100%. This is not a mature product DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FIRST GENERATION OF NEXUS ONE. You will regret it for 550+ If it was available for the Itouch price($199) then it MIGHT be worth it. Maybe version 2 will get it right.. Updated. on Jun 3, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Not an Iphone. 
Cons:. Virtually unusable. I really wanted to keep this phone, but it disappointed me time and again in so many way that this list is only partial. Lastly, it ties users alarmingly tightly to Google apps and Google's version of the Internet.. 
Summary:. 1. Does not support more than 1 calendar. 2. Syncs only with Gmail based accounts.. 3. Does not sync with latest versions of Outlook or Windows.. 4. Workaround (i.e. exporting calendar from Outlook and importing into gmail) works but is far too problematic. (Came up with error of "too many deletes", and wouldn't sync. Then, when I instructed gmail calendar to detlete anyway, it inexplicably sent literally hundreds of invitations to all of the meeting recipients from my calendar from the previous 2 years. Disaster.). 5. Battery exhausted within less than an hour.- WITHOUT EVEN USING THE PHONE. Too many apps open in the background. Tried AppKiller, but this workaround doesn't work either. Don't be fooled by people that say it does. I had to continually kill app's every ten minutes or so because they just keep launching no matter what you do. Finally, I just started uninstalling everything that wasn't absolutely necessary. That actually helped a little, but not enough.. 6. Random execution of apps when launching totally unrelated apps.. 7. Sometimes phone will not shut down and freezes at power off. Resolution: remove battery.. 8. Random freezes.. 9. If you go on a trip you have to instruct Map where you are - otherwise it doesn't know. Has a tendency to put you back at your hometown. However, GPS does seem to know. The public transportation route information came up blank for me in Washington DC. So, that feature seems to be just for show. Walking map was so slow I found the route myself before the map did. GPS consumes an enormous amount of battery. So, it's not useful unless plugged into a car charger. Don't install any of the Google labs stuff - map overlays, for example, are pretty much useless as they take way too long to load.. 10. Interface is overly complex compared to anything, but particularly when compared to iPhone.. 11.Takes forever to boot up after power off.. 12..Music interface sucks - way too simplistic.not enough search options.. 13. SD Card is sometimes not readable. Resolution: power off, remove battery, power back on. Still, this is scary if you've got a lot of data on it.. 14. Phone seems to heat excessively when charging and talking on the phone at the same time. Also, doesn't seem to charge well unless completely powered off.. 15. ETC.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great potential once Google lets Verizon or T Mobile sell the phone and customer service. 
Cons:. Read the help forms from Google's web site for the Nexus One. Scary!. 
Summary:. The phone is still in a testing phase and the testers are us, you if buy the phone. And if it breaks wow, restocking fee, and if they replace it you get a refurb but still pay the new price. Thats fair right!.
