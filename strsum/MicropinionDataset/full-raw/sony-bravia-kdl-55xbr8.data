this is the top of the mountain as far as led tv's go  .
i spent many hrs comparing the xbr8 to a samsung 950 and in every single important catagory the xbr8 spanked the sammy  .
deeper blacks  .
better color saturation  .
better screen uniformity  .
higher contrast  .
better shadow detail  .
better motion handling  .
onboard sound quality  .
it is no contest the sony won in every test i threw at it  .
yes the pioneer pro is the king of plasma but the xbr8 is by far the king of led get one while you still can  .
i knew that i wanted to buy the best hdtv that i could find (under 10 grand , anyway) , and this has proven to be it  .
even though i will probably not buy another set for a very long time , i still get curious to see what the next best thing will be  .
until someone releases a full 1  1 ratio led tv or a large format oled , i do not need to worry about wanting anything else .
the bottome line is that this tv is set apart from the rest of the led tv's  .
it's the only one that is not edge lit  .
the sony has 2800 clusters of led lights  .
that is what sets it apart and what made it more expence  .
the fact that it said sony on it is not the reason why it is more money  .
cnet sould update the facts once in awhile , ie    prices consumer , there is no such thing as a led tv  .
samsung and sharp have done a wonderful ad campain to make you think that there sets are led they are not they are led back lit  .
i am sorry , the world does have one true led tv and it's made by sony  .
it is called the xel1 and it's 2 grand for a 11 screen  .
this is the reason why the uk has told samsung to stop advertising their tv's as led tv's  .
stick with a company that only does entertainment products not one that makes heavy duty industrial earth movers , ohh and tv , cell phones , washers , dryers ect .
absolutely the best tv i have ever watched  .
ambient light in viewing area ruled out plasma and samsung led with glass screen  .
everything worked out of box using gui for tweaking with little need for reference to manual  .
paired with denon 4310ci (separate review) and lg bd390  .
everyone who visits is amazed  .
running out of popcorn updated  .
on oct 14 , 2009  .
looked for a long time and did a lot of research before deciding on this tv and am very happy with it .
excellent lcd  .
beautiful picture  .
a bit pricey , though it has come down considerably in the past two months drat  .
in short , i love it .
yes it is the most expensive  .
for the much higher price you get , compared to it's samsung competitor a950   slightly better detail in dark areas and shadows , better motion smoothing , less (almost none) blooming , better speakers , builter build quality  .
samsung does have more 'pop' in it's color    i have read this is a choosen difference between sony and samsung with the sony side saying samsung colors are 'cartoonish' and not accurate thought i admit they can look nice (and sometimes not nice) updated  .
on aug 6 , 2009  .
as electronic sales i truly think this is the best lcd hdtv .
i have been shopping for televisions for the last three months  .
i had considered the 52xbr6 , and then this one  .
i is very indecisive about spending this amount of money in this tv , until i test it at a local store  .
after making up my mind , i ended up buying the 55xbr8  .
our daily viewing patterns include mostly blue    ray movies and hd definition channels my previous purchase is last year is the 46w3000 , which now i placed in my bedroom  .
during the dismounting and mounting process i is able to compare both televisions side    by    side with blue    ray content at the same settings the 55xbr8 has the deepest blacks you will ever encounter in an lcd  .
the led lightning used in this lcd makes a complete difference in the image quality  .
in addition , the colors are truly unbelievable and breathtaking  .
i will not go to deep here in this area because there are a lot of in    depth reviews online that can validate my opinions with the led technology , you do not get the glowing blacks you get with the regular non    led lcd tvs  .
actually ; i did not realize how awful this effect is until i compared both televisions side    by    side even when you want to change the input select , the bottoms are invisible , until you touch the bottom right corner and the bottoms show up  .
this is one of the coolest features and my daughter loves it some people have complained about three things    .
price   if you make your research , you can get a good deal these days  .
however , keep in mind , that this is the best led lcd out there at the 55moment of the review , and is all worthy the glowing sony logo at the bottom   you can turn this off ; however , this is not distracting at all , and looks sharp the floating speakers   they are very thin  .
on the other side , i believe it adds value because at this price , you do not want the tv to look like every other tv out there i am not planning to change tv set in many , many years  .
this is the best lcd ever .
every detail of a high definition over    the    air sports and news broadcasts stands out  .
you can see detail in the fartherest reaches of the picture  .
on a black velvet news anchor's jacket , you can see the folds and every detail of the design  .
this is an amazing product  .
i have a long living room , so this big set on the opposite wall with a beautiful wood cabinet to hold my a    v equipment , really blends in perfectly  .
i is so worried about the piano black finish being a distraction , but it is not at all , and i've had the television for ten weeks now  .
i wanted a home theatre television to rival that of a small movie house , and that's exactly what i got  .
it is worth every penny of the money i invested  .
now , the prices will be falling , so i would seriously consider this set if you have a room or an area for home theatre , or if you watch a lot of television and movies  .
i also have the sony es receiver , which has the ability to have 7  .
1 surround while watching either television or movies  .
i cannot praise this set enough  .
every one who has seen it says that it rivals plasma for the color detail , but without the high    glare screen of a plasma set  .
believe me , you wo not be disappointed if you decide and have the room for this 55 inch beauty  .
even though it is a brand new release , sony had it on sale so we were able to afford an hdmi    empowered a/v receiver and a blue ray player within our budget  .
compare this tv side    by    side with a plasma like i did and you will be won over .
this is a real tv , the best of the best .
when i first saw this television in a local store i is amazed by the picture while watching slow and still images and horrified to see awful juddering on a fast action movie  .
this put me off the set and i viewed the other top televisions , including the kuro and the samsung , neither of which i is that impressed with  .
after contacting the store and telling them of the juddering i had seen they explained that the judder mode had been off and they had now switched it on  .
i returned to the store and saw the same movie , this time with each judder mode demonstrated by the sales guy  .
the result is a perfect dream of a picture without any of the juddering i had seen before  .
i am not a sony fan and have never owned a sony television  .
i only go by what i see and of all the televisions i have seen in the past two years , including plasma , the picture on the xbr 8 is the best i have seen without a doubt  .
an amazing tv that gives you real bong and wow factor  .
the 120hz , i might not yet be used to for watching blu    rays but a game like uncharted or resistance 2 on the ps3 looks superb sharp on that mode and will blow you away  .
if you live in an area with large windows around you or watch tv not just in the dark and in the day , the sony wil l be a much better choice then a plasma because those guys will just not be bright enough  .
on the other end , the quality of the picture , no ghosting , deep blacks and pretty fantastic sound for just built in speakers (although to all , i highly recommend , if your gaming or have blu    ray , do yourselves a favor and get a 5  .
1 or 7  .
1 setup) .
wayyyy expensive  .
but , after stepping up from a toshiba regza that i is never happy with and could never adjust the green push away , this sony is worth every cent  .
period .
i use this tv for both watching movies and playing games on the ps3  .
its really big screen is filled up with great picture (i'm being modest here) that has the darkest of blacks  .
sd looks okay but its watchable  .
hd pictures are fantastic  .
i've compared this tv's picture side by side with the pioneer plasmas and it is really really close  .
to my eyes the xbr5 looked better because the picture seemed to pop off the screen more and its reproduction of colour is more to my liking  .
while technically the plasma is rated higher i felt it was not as good  .
but this is just my opinion this led tv is not produced anymore , but if you can get this cheap like i did its well worth the money  .
i must say that its style is better than what sony sells these days i cannot give it a perfect score because of the few flaws that annoy me , but i cannot imagine too many better screens out there in terms of picture quality  .
audio should not be forgotten and sony in my opinion delivers the best straight from the set  .
it can get loud and is very clear with great reproduction and depth especially compared to others like samsung which just makes sound .
its expensive , but watching tv on this every night is worth the cost the image is beautiful , and yes i did shop the samsung stuff no comparison    this sony blows them all away .
the blu ray display on this television is absolutely outstanding  .
hands down better quality than my 50 + sony hd lcd from 2006  .
still learning some of the functions of the remote as it pertains to blu ray  .
a bit light on the manual for that .
with samsung massacring sony in sales (check out the most popular sets at amazon       usually samsung has all of the first 25 slots) , it is beginning to look bleak for sony  .
but with this set , they prove they can beat samsung at their own game (hi black contrast ratios , led lighting) , even as they continue to develop oed technology  .
i'm not buying this set , but i do see an opportunity in the stock  .
look for the features on this set to soon appear throughout the sony line .
i went to my friend's store which provides both lightened and darkened room for tvs as far as black performance goes , the a950 outperformed the xbr8 in real world  .
the ultra clear panel gives you more depth than the matted panel on the xbr8  .
the reason cnet gave xbr8 a bit better score is most likely because of the rgb led that gives the xbr8 less time to calibrate because it is quite accurate out of the box  .
but if both parties a950 and xbr8 were calibrated and have them side by side , the a950 will outperform the xbr8 either in a lightened room or darkened room  .
i have seen users with both tvs and the a950 gives a lot more stable color accuracy deltae across all colors than the xbr8 after calibration and it is funny that cnet had the a950 measured 0  .
00cd/m^2 and calling xbr8 have a better black which measured at 0  .
01cd/m^2  .
and cnet also stated that xbr8's black tends to go bluish which is just like every japanese tvs  .
whereas the samsung tv with ultra clear panel is towards true black with 0  .
00cd/m^2  .
i think that cnet better reconsider about their hyped comments in their reviews the image quality is obvious if you go see it in person side by side  .
the a950 ultra clear panel gives a better sense of depth and true black .
it seems that current lcd technology is going down the same path as microsoft pc technology  .
it definitely gets better , but a little more cluttered with more patches and fixes and cover ups to get the most out of it  .
i am sure that will change very soon  .
i have been a sony xbr owner since 86 , and after 5 different sets , i always thought they produced the best picture in any tv category until i had the chance to demo the xbr8 and the pioneer elite in an almost side by side comparison  .
truth be told , the pioneer outshines the sony where it matters to me most which is fast action hockey games , movies , etc  .
i can actually watch the game without any motion    blur    dizzy    sickness i get from my xbr1 , and to a much smaller degree , the xbr8  .
further , the overall colour representation and sheer clarity on the pioneer is almost spooky i kid you not  .
i am not dissing sony or it's tv as it is one hell of a product , and many will go for it and they should  .
its tomato and tomaato as far as i am concerned  .
but at this price point , and if you have a discerning eye , check out the two top dogs before dropping your hard earned , federal    reserve    approved    promissory    notes , and no matter if you choose the sony , or the pioneer , or you take the $$$ and go to st tropez for a month , at least you'll know you looked at the two best technological marvels as of november 23 , 2008  .
now , if they could just get rid of those silly , non    detachable speakers .
i had been looking forward to the arrival of the sony 55xbr8 ever since it is announced , and went to my local sony store in victoria , bc as soon as it arrived  .
when i walked into the store i could immediately tell which is the xbr8 because it stood out from the others , in completely the wrong way the images were lit up like a beacon compared with the earlier xbrs surrounding it  .
the colours were over saturated and fast motion left trails  .
needless to say i is very disappointed , but the salesperson insisted it is the best picture in the store  .
i am sure the set needed to be properly calibtrated , and i will check other stores to see if the 55xbr8 looks more like the standard reported in early reviews there is also a sony 46xbr8 in the store showing slow moving nature scenes , and the picture on this set is stunning    correct colour , but no means of checking motion blur i am sure most people buying a $7 , 000 television will use home theatre components for best sound reproduction , so i am surprised that sony still does not offer removeable speakers inspite of the first impressions , i still plan on buying the sony 55xbr8 , providing the picture is as good as the reviews report .
with motion or new scenes , the picture is truly horrible  .
salesman could not fix it  .
sony style store tysons corner mall va , 55xbr8 with sony blu    ray player playing transformers blu    ray dvd  .
it is as though the set is over    compensating for the hockey    puck effect  .
you did not see slightly lighter trailing image of what is moving  .
instead whatever is moving would leave a trail of    as best i can describe    invisible man effect of what is no longer there  .
you could see the outline of what had been in the location on the set in previous frames as if through a water bubble or odd lens  .
salesman is astonished when i pointed it out (perhaps because i told him it is the absolute worst lcd i had ever seen) and he tried to fix  .
he reset the cinema settings and played with a few other items  .
nothing resolved it  .
another , apparently more knowledgeable salesman , busy with other customers  .
no other blu    ray dvd's to switch to    i asked (that is a disappointment in a sony style store full of blu    ray dvd's)  .
is this ever seen in testing  .
i saw some of the same scenes on samsung ln55a950 at best buy and did not see such issues  .
any thoughts on cause  .
based on this review , i is expecting to be blown away  .
i've generally agreed with the reviews here on , for example , the pioneer 800 , samsung a950 , and pioneer kuro 111/151 updated  .
on nov 22 , 2008  .
