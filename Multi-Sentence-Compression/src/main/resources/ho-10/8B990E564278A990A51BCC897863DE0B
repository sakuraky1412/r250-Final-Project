our all-inclusive experience was so much better than we 'd expected - good choice of places to eat and drink on the location , meant that you never felt trapped or isolated when on property .

finally , namrata and gawtam were excellent staff members , but it is almost a little unfair to pick out individuals as there were a lot of very good service moments over the 10 days .
snorkelling is included and is not bad - but better to visit other sites on the island if you are really into discovering the beautiful underwater marine life .

the buffet does not always deliver what is advertised , however there is always plenty of choice and it is of very good quality overall .

staff are generally speaking very friendly and helpful - some signs that a little bit more nurturing of the less experienced staff would benefit them as well as the guests .

tadka was excellent quality for people who enjoy an indian but i would go somewhere else for the chinese as siaw is not as delicious though certainly nothing to complain about .
