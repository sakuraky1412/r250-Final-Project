voice activation did stop working & then came back in german ,  just changed it back english & has been working well since then .

voice commands were mechanical but clear .

the voices seem too robotic .

you have your choice of several languages and voices .

however, i much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .

from reviews, i thought there might only be one voice .

the text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .

0 out of 5 stars no jill voice on this one !

it seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .

some of the voices are annoying .

several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .

the non tts voice is more pleasant .

the 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .

there are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even australian, american and british english .

the voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .

the voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .

everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the tts mode .

i didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .

the voice commands are excellent and timely .

and the voice and streets match perfectly .
