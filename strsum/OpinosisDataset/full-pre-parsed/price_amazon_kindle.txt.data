 if a case was included, as with the kindle 1, that would have been reflected in a higher price .

 lower overall price, with nice leather cover .

if you have the first kindle and are deciding whether to upgrade, do it now while you can still get a good price for your old kindle on amazon's marketplace, craigslist, wherever .

 before purchasing, i was obsessed with the reviews and predictions i found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery sd slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .

 however, i think all the positives of the k2 greatly make it worth the price which i'll talk about below .

 we have all paid for our covers whether it's an  extra  cost or added in to the price of the e, reader .

 amazon is not charging full price to replace a broken or damaged kindle .

 i believe that what he said was that when the books were on the nyt best seller's list, they would be priced at $9 .

 when the book was no longer on that list, the price could change .

 there are text books and other books that run in the hundreds of dollars price range .

of course they won't be priced at $9 .

 the difference between the books i've purchased and the price of the kindle is about $166 .

 in addition, the prices for books are often more expensive , ,  particularly new releases .

one last thing i was unaware of is how much free or nominally, priced content there is for the kindle .

 konrath are offering novels at prices ranging from $1 to $2 dollars, as a way to find new readers .

00, so the price of kindle effectively dropped to $349 .

 savings trump purchase price with kindle's low book price advantages .

i would have been glad to have paid any price to have had a book reader that was easier to read for myself with 20 20 vision and especially for the low, vision reader .

i did see a few big price differences eg .

the other drawback for some is the price .

 book prices are less than you will find in book stores and may be less than you will find on other e, book sites .

is the k2 so much better than the k1 as to justify the price ?

 the but comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .

 since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .

the lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .

 i want you to know that ultimately, however, if i want a kindle i will have to capitulate and accept amazon's terms because amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and i will have to purchase one even at prices i believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .

 and i know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .

 at the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .

 to have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the kindle truly irrelevant .

 price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !

as a teacher, i really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that i could give myself the excuse to purchase it .

 disappointing given the prices .

 the price for new hardbacks on the kindle is great too .

 after reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, i took the plunge .

 the ability to plug in headphones and play miles davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .

if you are searching for a real review on the kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .

 however, i will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .

 those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .

 i found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .

 to justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .

 the price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .

i was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .

 mind you, it's the same size as the kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but i for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .

 if i have to spend the full puirchase price on the k2 with a k1 still in hand i would have probably waited .

although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .

but, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, i have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .

 i just hope that the price goes down .

 yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a kindle 1 .

 but given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the city, i didn't mind paying the current price .

 that may not be true for everyone, but, as i said, i'm sure the price will eventually come down .

 some people may find this an inconvenience, but i think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where i am located .

 books are retardedly pricey .

 should have been priced at $250  .

 even if you want to , i think it is way too pricey .

 the subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .

 though it would be nice if the cover was included in the k2 price, it is still worth buying .

 it is pricey but if you buy as many books as i do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .

 the price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .

 the price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though i would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .

 i'm positive that future releases will bring the price point down .

2, book selection & price,  i made a list of 20 books .

 of the 20, several were priced higher on b&n then amazon, significantly so, while 5 were not available on b&n at all .

 for the price of a few hundred used old, fashioned  paperbacks  and free your shelves for figurines or a nice bottle collection !

when the original kindle was released, i was intrigued, but never researched it due to the insanely high price tag .

 it was obviously out of my price range .

 one, for what you get it is over priced .

last i would suggest for the price a protective cover should be included with the product .

the price, tag for this item is quite steep when you first look at it .

 i checked the difference in price between the cheapest print available of the books and the kindle editions .

 turns out some of them were the same price, while others were much cheaper for the kindle .

 she thought she wanted one, but was a bit daunted by the price and the question of how much she would actually use it .

 i thought about buying an ebook reader for a few months and had thought i would go with the b&n nook until i compared book prices between b&n and amazon .

 amazons book are priced significantly lower and easier to find in my opinion .

 ultimately, i end up paying full price and have for many years .

 about a month ago after finishing in one weekend and realizing that i paid $28 for it i thought kindle's cheaper prices and mobility would be great .

 i can download samples and buy books for $10 so i have a lot of things i would not buy if i had to pay full price .

books are priced in us$ for oversea consumers .

99, thus offsetting the high price of the kindle .

 perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but i find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the library because of inflated prices for the new releases .

 if amazon reduces their prices back to the $9 .

99 price and credits those who've paid more, i'll once again recommend kindle .

 another has a desire to obtain old books ,  we looked up moby dick and she was amazed that the price was only $1 .

most of the complaints about the kindle price, b&w, no wifi, etc .

as to price, i usually purchase books on a weekly basis .

 while the price of the kindle 2 isn't inexpensive, adding up how much i spend in books and how much room they take up !

 i had been wanting a kindle but had balked at getting one because of the price, but after our last move and packing up all of our books, and giving many away i was more open to the idea .

 i was still hesitant after i saw the kindle 2 because of price .

 the ability to clip articles, make notes and save items for later is priceless .

 even the price doesn't bother me .

 in addition, you can sort the kindle books by price and find many more free books .

 reading is something that i absolutely love, but i find it hard to wait several days for a book to be shipped to me or pay the outrageous prices at a bookstore .

i would love a case cover that's well made and doesn't cost a third the price of the device .

 i must say that i am shocked at how many of these  reviews  are one stars given by people complaining about the price but dont even own a kindle !

 there are many other ways such as mp3 players, portable dvd players, not to mention the radio to listen to while driving, that are almost fully paid for by the price for just one audio book .

i don't miss the pricetag of a printed book !

 to buy the international version of the kindle 2, i have to admit, that this is a great device and for me worth the price .

no waiting time for the paperback version, and getting the e, book version almost for the same price as the paperback version

4 delivery and prices for austrian user

the average price of an up, to, date e, book for an austrian user is about 13,79 usd, some you get for about 10,58 usb .

 non, best seller book prices should be lower, just like some magazine subscriptions are .
