i use the camera primarily when travelling  .
my wife has a canon slr , which take the landscape etc  .
but for documenting people and places the dsc    t100 is perfect  .
i also take lot of video , they i afterwards edit together with our pictures , earlier i used a videocamera but the qualitydifference is so small , i have stopped taking the video  .
we do bicycling , and the small size even make it possible to take pictures from the bike .
great digital camera  .
extremely easy to use especially for the novice or technologically challenged  .
very large lcd display with easy to read menus  .
pics download in seconds  .
this camera takes beautiful professional quality photographs but is so easy to use anyone who knows how to point and click will be able to use this camera in no time flat  .
because this camera has so many features the professional can utilize it's price is higher than allot of similar cameras out there  .
trust me this one is worth the money .
this is by far the best ultra compact point and shoot on the market  .
takes great pictures , video , and extrmemly handy slideshow software  .
best macro and super macro ive seen on a point and shoot , and with the image stabilizer , you can get crisp shots even at 5x zoom .
i'm not going to re    list all the attributes already posted here by others and cnet staff , but i just have to add a few significant things i think were left off other reviews  .
this is my seventh point shoot camera (all of them high    end canon , nikon , or sony models) and it is by far a better camera than all the others i have never seen a camera of this size do so well at long    exposure , no    flash , pictures , such as indoor close    ups , etc  .
it's inaugural voyage is to the virginia beach aquarium , and every close    up into a tank , all in dark rooms , were phenomenally clear and perfectly exposed another first for me with a camera this size is the flash fill  .
i've taken many test pictures indoors , even at night (with room lighting) and the expected dark corners just were not there  .
one of the other things i really like is it's ability to retain whatever flash setting i choose (e  .
no flash) when i power it off and back on  .
i think it's one of the few point shoots that does this (no canon models do this) lastly , with the 5x optical zoom i figured at approximately 3x i'd start experiencing the jitter factor , but no  .
even at 5x and shooting one    hand  while walking  i got perfect pictures it's a little pricey , but i honestly believe you get what you pay for here  .
also , for anyone who's worried about the small size i have large hands and this is very easy to use  .
as with any small camera , i recommend keeping the wrist strap in place larrymcj  .
i 've read different reviews on amazon and cnet which say that picture quality is not good at night or in low lights , however the picture quality is excellent so do not worry it's a great choice and the right camera to have yes i do agree high iso 3200 makes the picture blur , but there is no point in using it , as without any lights in the room i can shoot pictures with great results  .
the smart zoom feature impressed me a lot , i do not need to have any bigger camera which has more optical zoom , as the smart zoom feature captures all what you want the movies are excellent so interested people may also buy 2 gb memory card alongwith the camera to compensate even for a movie camera i do 've pictures to share , any1 interested can get in touch with me .
okay , i've been looking for a great camera for the past 6 months , and i'll have to say that i've found it  .
i only bought the dsc t    100 four days ago , and it is the best  .
i'm not just saying this because it's a sexy camera  .
i'm saying it because i want all of you to know that it is a camera worth buying the lcd screen is huge ; for all those people who like having bigger screens , then this camera is definetly for you  .
i is first supposed to buy the leica c    lux 2 , but bought this camera  .
if you're looking for a spectacular camera , buy this camera .
i bought this camera because    .
it has the burst feature (keep taking  .
pictures as long as the shutter button is held down) 2  .
i can transfer images directly to my ipod 3  .
it can zoom while recording 4  .
5x optical zoom and 6  .
sony is a name i trust .
the t100 would be my third p s camera from sony , and for the past 2 weeks it has performed well above my expectations compared to my past models (dsc    p7 dsc    t1)  .
i am a house music dj in los angeles so my camera is always in use and on the road  .
the slim form factor is a definate must for all clubbers alike  .
it fits comfortably in my back pocket and is always a thrill to whip it out and get those ooo's aah's from everyone  .
day or night , the 8  .
1 mp sensor really shines for those up close and personal shots  .
the 3 inch display is absolutley astounding  .
clear and crisp enough so the ladies can review the shots i took  .
i have not played around with the editing tools built in so i will get back to you guys , but looking forward to playing around with their optional wide angle lens conversion kit they got  .
that's all for now  .
hope this helps you all  .
this is easliy one of the best digital cameras on the market , and can support upto 6 hrs of standard (640) video recording which is amazing  .
(24hrs of low res (320))  .
the high definition pics are amazing , with the best user interface available on a 3 inch amazing tft screen w  .
got an amazing deal at singapore for usd 399 incuding 1 gb pro    duo stick , sony cover case , and tft protect sticker .
this camera is simply amazing  .
it is smaller than it looks in the pictures  .
the lcd screen takes up most of the back  .
i have already tried many different types of shots with this camera , and it does exactly what is stated  .
to test the response of the camera , i waved my hand quickly in front of the lens , and when it took the picture , my hand is completely clear and focused  .
the face detection is perfect  .
i tested it on my friends , and also tested it on posters with 4 or 5 people , and the face detection worked every time  .
you can upload your personal music to play during slidshow playback , which is a cool feature  .
there are many modes and specifications avaiable  .
i did a lot of research on many cameras before deciding to buy one  .
this is by far the best digital camera i have ever had  .
it is a bit steep on price ($400) , but after buying it and using it , it is definatly worth this price  .
i would recommend this camera to everyone thinking about getting a sleek digital camera  .
it is a shame cnet has not done a review of this camera yet , because it everyone needs to know about its qualities and performance  .
i am so happy that i went with this camera  .
sony has finally decided to step up and come out with an ultracompact that is better than canon  .
i is set on buying the canon sd800is but then came across this beauty it is not in stores yet but can be purchased online from circuit city  .
sony also has an optional docking station that should be coming out soon which will be nice this camera has a 5x zoom which is incredible for its size  .
the new processing engine is noticeably faster and comes from their slr camera line  .
face detection and the 9 point auto focus and big pluses as well from sony   with super steadyshotï¿½ optical image stabilization and high sensitivity (iso 3200) , the dsc    t100 compensates for shaky hands , minimizes blur , brightens images and allows flash    free shooting to preserve the mood  .
and the clear raw noise reduction will take care of the picture noise that can ruin low    light shots  .
pictures look great and i have a trip to hawaii coming up and i look forward to using this camera and comparing my pictures to my sony h5 there are also multiple colors available but not all colors can be purchased right now since it has just been released .
best point and shoot camera i ever had , lens are superb for their size , bright and almost distortion free , colors are vibrant , start    up is fast , my only complain is the battery that died after a year of regular use (3000 photos) .
upgraded from my kodak dx7590 which had a 10x zoom , but is very bulky to take places , so wanted a quality point and shoot camera  .
so far i have made a good decision  .
everything is working beautifully  .
image stabilization and face detection are a must now and this camera has both and a carl zeis lens  .
would recommend this camera to any novice photographer that just wants to go out and capture some memories not try to make picture taking more complicated than it needs to be .
i bought this camera b/c of the awesome reviews it had and i feel like it is one of the best investments in a camera possible  .
i feel like i know camera's pretty well  .
i'm an ameteur photographer and this is def  .
a good choice for a digital point and shoot if you understand even just a little how to work the exposure controls on a camera (which depond on the setting of the room you're in) then you'll love this camera  .
the exposure controls on this camera are soooo easy to figure out  .
anyone could do it the best thing is , even if you're not a buff on exposure controls , just set it to auto  .
and it will auto adjust to the environment and take the best pic this camera takes great photos and it's startup time is super fast which is an under    rated feature in dig cameras i'm a perfectionist when it comes to printing quality  .
and for a point    and    shoot , it doesn't get any better than this  .
to get better quality , you'd probably have to buy a high end pro camera bottom line   if you know how to set the exposure controls to the room you're in or if you're outdoors (and with this camera it's super easy) , then you will be pleased with this camera do not let the very few bad reviews stop you from considering this camera  .
consider the fact that is recieved an editor's choice and rating of 8  .
beutifuk camera with easy to use menu and greate image quality , active 5x optical zoom during video mode makes it even better than other digital cameras in its class  .
the only yhings i considered negative is missing the optical view finder .
im impressed with this camera than my previous kodak cx7430 i like its super macro feature also i like its high sensitivity in low light environment its quicker shots it requires me another 2 extra batteries for my unlimited shots and a 4gb high speed memory stick (very expensive stuff here in philippines , hmnnn) finally its the best camera i've got so far .
like i said great camera right out of the box just put battery in and away you go taking great pictures  .
i cannot find anything wrong with this camera and do not know how anyone could say anthing bad about this camera  .
this camera is all expected it to do and more  .
the pictures are just great  .
this is my 3rd digital camera and i'm very please with it  .
another great sony product  .
i purchased the camera at j r music world great low price and they had stock .
i bought this camera and the underwater housing for a scuba vacation in cozumel , mexico  .
and i must say , i love it  .
the photos a very clear , and the 3 screen enabled me to check the quality of the photo instantanously under water  .
the camera's super    closeup feature enabled me to take remarkably clear photos of very small creatures       and because the camera has 8 megapixels , i is later able to crop those photos and still have high    quality prints  .
on land , the quality of the photos is even more impressive   the 5x zoom is remarkable for a camera of this size , and the photos came out perfectly without any digital enhancing the only reason that i rated this camera a 9 instead of a 10 is that its menu is not optimally user friendly , imho   the movie mode (which is awesome , by the way) and manual adjustment mode are slightly buried in the camera's menu       as opposed to having a button readily available on the outside of the camera ala on canon's digital cameras  .
ultimately , the menu is fine , and it just takes a couple of additional seconds to switch modes  .
but when you're under water and trying to switch modes before a cool sea creature swims away , those couple of additional seconds can make a difference overall , this camera is definitely worthy of cnet's high ranking , and i definitely recommend it .
pretty much i tested all the options took it to yosemite , santa cruz    roller coaster shots came great  .
and took hell a lot of pics in an indoor party , all came great  .
good battery life  .
i dropped on a hard rock and still works great  .
great , great , great    excellent camera  .
well i have been using this camera for the past 2 months or so and i am pretty happy with it  .
you won't be disappointed with its photo quality if you are a professional photographer and do not have those professional cameras with you at the moment  .
the 3inches big screen is absolutely amazing  .
also the face detection technology is pretty good and detects photo on a poster , of a statue and people  .
the function i like about this camera is its steady shot technology  .
it works perfectly specially if you have a shaky hand  .
that is the case with me  .
also the video quality is astounding and i love it but there is just one problem that i found with this camera i  .
at night it flashes a lots of times and slows down the picture taking process but , overall i think this is a spectacular camera worth its cost .
this is a great camera for someone that wants to be able to take easy pictures on the go  .
it's small enough to fit in my pocket and yet still takes great pics and videos  .
there are a ton of built in settings for different light , and types of objects that make it easy to get great shots  .
i thought it is a bit expensive but i feel its well worth the money now .
excellent features , perfect size , and usually sony quality .
i've only had the camera a few weeks but it has had plenty of use so far  .
i took the time to play with the settings in the different environments i is in , to truly get the best pictures  .
i know most people keep it on the default settings and hope for the best  .
well the best is in the camera you just have to find it  .
the shutter time for action photos is great  .
i is able to take photos of people golfing with the ball suspended only feet from the golf club  .
great , great action  .
low light pics is a little tricky but you can still get good vibrant shots  .
i will be buying the water proof case very soon to take to jamaica so i will hit you people back after i give that a run .
i gave a lot of weight to purchasing one of the canon sd lines of cameras  .
unfortunately , none of them had all the features i wanted  .
the dsc    t100 does have all these features and several originally not considered that cannot be underestimated  .
firstly , for any compact/ultracompact camera , image stability control is a must  .
secondly , the larger 3 inch screen is worth the loss of a view    finder no matter what the cnet review says  .
the lcd screen is fast , easy to view in sun , and large ; so a view finder is not necessary  .
sensitivity modes are great  .
battery life is better than previous camera , though charge time is 3 hrs  .
the carl zeiss lens provides an undistorted picture with no fringe effects , and the super had ccd can easily offer high sensitivity that pairs well with the lens  .
this camera teaches you the importance of a 5x as opposed to a 3x zoom , which in turn underscores the great image stability control  .
i did have one moment of head scratching frustration  .
sony offers multiple different modes under the home button , ie auto adjustment , program auto , scene selection  .
they call them shooting scenes  .
these scenes when selected change the options available under the menu button , such as sensitivity , face recognition , flash , etc  .
once you realize this , however , you begin to appreciate the different modes and how they offer quick changes without manually modifying every menu option  .
the interface is great for this camera  .
i understand cnet's criticism of the buttons , but if they were any larger you would not have a place to put your thumb or finger to stabilize the camera without accidentally pressing a button  .
finally , buy the camera for the start up , image capture , and repeated capture times  .
just flip the brushed metal cover down and the camera is up before you can point it .
one of the best and 1st slim camera i have ever owned  .
i have tried using other slim cameras i got my hands on  .
however , none can be compared with this gem photos can be taken indoors without flash , however alittle stable hands will be helpful  .
photos can then be taken without any artificial light flood from the flash in the hands of a not so amateur user , the quality and composition of the pics are only limited by the imagination with photo editing options in the camera , it creates interesting and beautiful photos with lots of ease and fun  .
the close up macro focus is fantastic for this slim camera  .
objects taken looks sharp and could sometimes be pass off as a photo taken by a professional photographer it is suitable even for the most basic users or professional photographers who might want to look for a simple and light alternative camera , to carry along at anytime the only strange thing that happen was , my very 1st t100 i bought , practically died on me within 5 days  .
all with normal use  .
it refuses to turn on  .
the cause of it is unknown after much trouble , i manage to get a 1 for 1 exchange  .
the newly replaced t100 has not disappoint me since .
this is a great camera  .
it is fairly quick taking pictures and starting up , and the 5x zoom is great  .
it has a great feel to it , and looks very clean  .
it is pretty compact as well  .
best of all , it takes very nice pictures  .
the edges of objects are very sharp and defined , better than what i've ever seen from a point and shoot  .
i also dig that the body and screen are hard to scratch  .
i really cannot see many problems with this camera  .
i definitely would recommend it , its a great toy .
easy to use , clear picture quality , small and compact .
my second generation of this same camera  .
1st one screen broke after sitting on it too many times  .
lasted 3 years of using it everywhere  .
had this one for about 6 months , still great  .
takes excellent photos .
the sony cybershot dsc    t100 is an excellent point and shoot camera  .
it takes great landscape pictures and portraits when lighting is fair  .
in dim lighting , it suffers the same drawback as a typical point and shoot camera in automatic or preset scene modes  .
when taking pictures in a very large room with dim lighting such as an auditorium , you will need to use the iso mode  .
the steady shot feature does not work quite so well in iso mode  .
you may need to set the camera on a stable surface or use a tripod or your pictures will be blurry .
at first , i didn't like it but after setting it on program mode with iso at 80 , it turns out i love it  .
i mainly use this camera for day and evening indoor pictures , so that is why i set iso to 80  .
i also own a sony t    7 which is very thin but do not have the features that this t    100 have like super steady shot and super quick capture response  .
i received alot of attention and compliments when i pull this camera out  .
face detection do not work if you have it on program mode , only auto mode  .
in auto mode , your picture can get grainy in dark setting because of high iso  .
overall the picture and colors are excellent in lighted settings  .
battery life is very good  .
i recommend getting a different camera for night pictures like the cheap canon sd1000 and do not have to worry about losing it  .
i would buy it again if i lost this t    100 .
the day after i bought it i used it at my friends wedding  .
he now have some of my pictures in his official wedding album and the main wedding photo is in a 10 inch frame i love it so much i take it everywhere i go  .
thats a first for me .
this camera has just about everything you wish in one ultra compact camera  .
i rate it a 9 for it's picture quality , ergonomics and other pros listed above  .
features are short a bit for a new high priced compact digital just released  .
so , what should be considered for the next release since hd/multimedia is becoming so popular routine    .
)16  9 'wide field' sensor instead of the 'old' 4  3 had format sensor 'com'on times are changing you lose resolution selecting 16  9 format 2  .
) higher and multiple selected video modes like hd resolutions 1024x768/1280x720/848x480 and selectable in different frame speeds 30/24/15 fps 3  .
) wifi/bt  .
things that need to be fixed asap  .
) better/faster lens for lower iso settings  .
) problems occurred indoors and/or low light shots (weak flash/lens aperture)  .
) useless high iso settings , auto iso does not work well indoors    too noisy  .
so it's an 8 instead of a 9 because of the indoor short comings and not a 10 for missing features/enhancements .
i is dying to get my hands on the camera but waited a few weeks after its initial debut at the sony store  .
i is a bit disappointed because i is looking for a dcam similar in size to the t10 model  .
though still part of their compact series , the t100 is not as compact as i hoped it would be  .
in fact the size easily rivals the w70/w90 cybershot models  .
one major difference between the two , which is what prompted me to sell my w90 and get the t100 , is that you cannot zoom on the w90 while taking video  .
the t    series gives you this ability the lcd is extremely large , compared to all other models i have owned , and i love it  .
the image stabilization is great and a life    saver for someone who is a bit shaky when clicking , like myself  .
i'm still trying to play around with the white balance though , as some pics taken appear to be on the yellow side  .
but that may also be due to the flourescent lighting around and not the camera itself the menu is much different than all sony dcam predeccesors , which i am still getting used to overall , it is a great choice for me as i carry the camera around with me everywhere i go .
amongst may results which i still dream to result there is one option that is really disturbing me and that is the print of date on the photographs  .
i is innitally using dsc    w5 and is quite easy to use and with this i am having a difficulty of using the options .
bought this to replace a dsc    t10 which had lots of problems with halos around dust    bunnies  .
updated the firmware on this camera    download it via the sony website pros   5x zoom , compact size , easy to power on , great shots (focus+color) if lighting is not an issue , looks great , non    protruding lens , good battery life , on    camera storage in case you forget your memory stick (oops  .
cons   horrible in low light in auto mode (poor focus , grainy)  .
my friend's canon sd750 takes better pics in low light  .
2 button menu system    looks like it is designed for the t200 and crammed into this one  .
slightly wider angle lens would be nice  .
still some issues with halos around dust bunnies (not as frequent/bad as the t10 though)  .
the low light issue is the major downfall of an otherwise great camera (fix it in the firmware please sony  .
first of all , i really like the form factor  .
i had the t100 for about 3 weeks before the t200 came out (same thing but a little thinner and the entire back is now a touchscreen lcd  .
i returned it to circuitcity because i thought it is defective when every pic i took had grayed out corners  .
turns out thats just the way the darn thing works  .
it takes horrible pics in low light situations (even with the flash on  .
the only major design flaw is that they put the lens right where 75% of people seem to want to put their index finger  .
i asked a few strangers to take pics of me and my girlfriend in cabo and my lens became smudged with sunscreen and sweat  .
nice right  .
well i have a brand new t200 now and i always warn people about the lens before letting them use it  .
i'm keeping this one  .
the touchscreen rocks  .
i got the sexy red one  .
looks great and takes very good outdoor shots  .
for indoor i had to manually adjust the lighting for fluorescene , incandescene , etc  .
just too much hassles for an automatic camera  .
its price is no subject for me but i now regret not looking at the canon 800 series .
i do like this camera , i take a lot of pictures with it and it's minimum focus distance is  amazing  (you can almost use it as a microscope)  .
but it vignettes (darkens the corners of the photograph) a great deal , more than i would think a major company would allow itself to produce  .
this can usually be overcome in photoshop or lightroom or something , but its annoying  .
what cannot be overcome is the strange way that it interpolates images (combines the red , green , and blue pixels to form a jpeg) that produces a pixelated haze like i've never really seen before , and i've used a lot of different cameras  .
you can only see it when you look at the picture at 100% so it's not that bad but it does limit how large you can print them out  .
bottom line   this is a great pocket camera with some really impressive features , and for the most part it does what it's supposed to  .
it just has these two quirky little things that you have to deal with .
i do not consider myself as a profesional photographer but i know a lot of things about photography  .
i have profesional nikon camera that for several reason i can get into many concerts and activities  .
i try several point    and    shoot cameras including sony , fujifilm and canon i decided to buy the sony t    100 and the canon sd750 to compare them side by side after several shoots i found that both camera work very well under sunny days  .
the problem starts during night  .
as many of you know , almost all point and shoot cameras fail to provide quality images during night shooting  .
but the canon really surprise me bringing really good images that sony fails  .
as an example , i took a photo of my cat (black and some yellow    orange dots) in a low light room  .
the sony picture fail to provide a define hair of my cat with a really noisy quality even when both cameras were set with exactly the same setting (same iso , same wb , same distance , etc) conclusion   sony did not provide a outstanding improvement in the new camera  .
in term of quality , i will said that sony did not make any changes from previous cameras  .
they add some cool features like the face detection (canon sd750 also detect faces easily and faster that sony)  .
but nothing that really wow to me canon win this battle (for me)  .
if i had to say something bad about the canon sd750 , i will said that during night (and in auto mode) the flash really iluminate the faces , maybe more than i prefered  .
a solve the problem by switching to manual mode and decreasing the ev value to    1 or    1  .
5 sorry sony , but canon win this battle  .
even when i am a really fan of sony products .
i miss my t    1 which i sold in order to upgrade to the t    100  .
the t    1 could switch from photo to video with the flick of a finger nail in a fraction of a second without even looking at the camera  .
not so with the t100 which requires a menu access so you can scroll through the settings to switch between modes  .
five steps forward , one step back .
if anyone knows please let me know  .
i cannot find it anywhere in the manual either .
i is really torn as to which high    end ultracompact to buy  .
i is using cnet's editor's reviews to guide me , and i jumped on this camera when an unused floor model is available for only $270  .
i've found that the most valuable aspect of an ultracompact is taking stealthy , no    flash photos inside  .
this is a huge disappointment with the dsc    100  .
while high iso noise is expected , what i could not deal with were the brightly colored pixel speckles that showed up  .
after taking this camera through it's paces pretty thoroughly , it has some truly unbelievable performance (the macro is almost microscopic in its details , high and low flash is a nice option) it is not worth the trade    off (even at $150 below retail)  .
i'm now the satisfied owner of a canon sd870is  .
it's not as compact or solid felling , but it handles low    light situations much better .
i recently purchased a canon sd    800 is that i planned to give my mother for her birthday  .
after the excellent cnet review of the dsc    t100 i decided that i had bought the wrong camera  .
it is a gift for mom's birthday and she deserved the best  .
therefore , i kept the canon and bought her the supposedly better sony  .
i couldn't have been more wrong  .
here is my story immediately following my decision to purchase her the sony and for me to keep the canon i visited the monterey bay aquarium  .
amazingly enough i found out that the canon had a setting for this very instance  .
amazed , i had unbelievable shots come out when everyone else around is wishing they could turn their flash off  .
even with such low light  .
and of course , not using the sony yet , but knowing it is so much better from some reviews and specs sheets , i could only imagine the great pictures my mother would soon be taking with her new sony t100 digital camera first day with the new camera and already disappointed  .
whilst already aware of their proprietary memory format , i is unaware of the unusually large data cable  .
surely ridiculous i thought , well nothing is perfect  .
and i brushed it off as poor design  .
not even strike one yet once opened and battery charged we decided to use it for the first time during a pool party  .
since my mother is no expert she asked me to help her get the camera in the right setting  .
being my first time with the camera i expected to not do very well with the menus  .
and i didn't do very well  .
nor did my mother  .
she eventually made me trade her the canon so she could at least understand how to use it when working through the menus  .
even weeks later i still have issues with the menus  .
hard to understand and difficult to navigate menus  .
strike one now back to the pool party  .
we were happy to find a beach setting for supposedly great shots with beautiful blues  .
and they were great  .
not anything special but not bad at all  .
however , plenty of blur  .
apparently even with all the stabilizers we still had blur issues  .
but i don't hold that against sony  .
many factors contribute to that  .
however , it is one reason i go the camera in the first place  .
then when we tried to find an appropriate setting for indoors we were baffled by the lack of settings  .
most only covered outdoor scenes  .
not a single indoor setting  .
the selections were slim compared to the canon i had and on top of that the flash settings were locked and none of us could figure out how to change them (and not mentioned in the manual)  .
later i realized it is due to the burst mode disabling the flash  .
after that it allowed us to change the flash settings but it would have been nice to let the user know  .
with all the screen space the best message sony could muster barely took up 10% of the screen  .
they had plenty of space to say something like , flash settings cannot be changed in burst mode  .
i guess that would make too much sense  .
either way the difficulty surrounding this model is beginning to become clear  .
lack of easy to understand settings   strike two then once i finally got used to the difference between the home button and the menu button , things were looking up  .
i got some great shots and even started using the movie mode  .
the only complaint there is that movie mode is on the opposite spot from the auto setting in the menu and there is no menu wrapping  .
the ideal would be for me to start at the top and by pressing up i would be automatically shoved to the bottom  .
a revolving menu is very common  .
why not on this camera  .
so switching modes again is a huge pain  .
on the canon it is two clicks up or down to switch between movie and auto settings  .
and with canon's better choice of settings , only one click up or down from scene selection  .
but yet that is not strike three  .
and not even the fact that it never let me review my pictures for the 2 seconds it is supposed to qualified for a strike  .
wanna know what the third strike was  .
you asked for it muxed mpeg    1 video  .
and before i get into it , i consider myself a flexible person  .
so even with all the negative things so far with the sony i is still not upset enough to be bothered by it's poorly designed user interface and proprietary memory and data cable  .
but once i tried to import my videos into a non    linear editor like imovie , i lost all respect for sony  .
they really screwed me over on this one the most idiotic thing they could have done  .
so i use a mac  .
and we have some of the best video editing tools on the planet  .
but to use their video from the cameras they sell now you have to use windows and their own software  .
the good news is i wouldn't mind if the software is actually good  .
but it is horrid  .
at least mac os x and the hardware actually live up to the hype  .
ok , i digress i had heard of situations before about sony handycam's using these weird video formats  .
take advchd for example  .
most editing software wo not recognize it without the use of conversion software , outside of sony's own software , of course  .
and then there are the mini dvds and the muxed mpeg    2 formats  .
it is simply ridiculous  .
strike 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 go for this for this is the single hardest task i had taken on for some time  .
this camera and friends and a clients  .
all 3 sony  .
all 3 using different incompatible formats for video  .
muxed mpeg    1 and 2 formats and the still nearly completely unsupported advchd (mpeg    4) format in closing , i would like to point out that the canon sd800 is is a much better buy  .
open video format usable by countless video editing programs , standard memory stick support , standard mini    usb jack for easy hook up even if the original cable is missing or damaged and the user experience is far better while using the camera in everyday situations buy a canon  .
vote sony off the island with your wallet and make them realize that their business can no longer get away with shoving inferior technology down consumer's throats i apologize if this came off too harsh  .
i am still reeling from the nightmarish weekend i had while trying to get my videos to work in my imovie software  .
i found a way by using mpegstreamclip software  .
it is free and works great  .
but the audio still had timing issues regardless  .
visit my youtube page to view my videos  .
danr2c2 is my user name  .
the mexico trip is the one i used the sony camera with .
i realize that many love neat looking gizmos and thereby can be blinded to the true performance of said product  .
it seems as if i as well as cnet can be guilty of the same i bought my t100 based on the cnet review  .
however , i sold it just after 2 weeks of use  .
the t100 is feature rich but the point of a camera is also to take good pictures  .
although it does a decent job at iso 100 , at higher iso's it is very noisy  .
at iso 400 the noise is very noticeable even on 4x6 prints  .
even at lower iso's the noise is noticeable on darker areas of a picture .
i is really disappointed with this camera  .
do not get me wrong  .
i love the 3 in lcd and the beautiful design , but there is one flaw above all  .
a camera especially a snapshooter like this one should work on auto mode and most importantly , aesthetics aside , it should shoot nice photos the inability to do the aforementioned is this camera's greatest flaw  .
indoor photos in low light conditions are grainy and horrible  .
for this reason i gave it a 6 instead of an 8 or 9 which this camera deserves but sony robbed themselves of a great product i wanted a camera to take to parties and dinners with my friends and to shoot group photos and what not  .
for this application , this camera is lacking  .
i'm disappointed in sony  .
if only they had taken test photos indoors they would have discovered this flaw  .
otherwise it is a superb camera aesthetically  .
once again , sony lacks in the image quality dept .
the sony dsc    100 is an okay camera  .
basic point    and    shoot camera , with good features  .
one of my favorites are the beach mode , and the snow mode ; very vibrant photos  .
although the manual settings for this camera is mediocre  .
pictures come out poor many reviews (from other websites , also) states that this camera have a weak flash and bad pictures in low    light , which is true , but i think that is a little exaggerated  .
the pictures in low light are above exceptional , in which i like a lot  .
photos indoor with out flash still produce great photos  .
but elite photographers expect cameras to do well in very low light , or even no light at all , which this camera cannot do because it's simply a point    and    shoot  .
i've tried using this camera in no light situations , and the photo are not as good  .
but with low light , it is exceptional  .
but overall , it's just exceptional , not good overall , this camera is not too bad , for mainly outdoors  .
if you like photos in very low light , or night time , then maybe this camera is not for you  .
but if you don't mind the low light pictures , and mainly use cameras for outdoor , then this camera is worth it one more thing   do not get your hopes up  .
like some other reviews that mention the poor quality of low light photographs , it's true  .
i just cannot believe sony actually went on to produce this product , or do they not know that the quality sucks  .
a little about me , i love cameras and have owned a lot of them , i like exploring new technology and reviewing it , after owning the sony h2 (and absolutely loving it)i gave this camera a try and boy is i disappointed yes the camera is gorgeous and it's fast and light  .
but what are cameras for  .
taking pictures right  .
well this camera doesn't deliver anything near what it should , for it's price and reputation first of all the low light pictures are by far the worst pictures i have ever seen not even my 7 year old camera is this bad , colors get lost and there is 60% loss of detail , something i have never seen  .
the flash is not strong enough to cover the camera at zero zoom and it docent reach the far end either  .
so this camera scores a 2 in low light conditions second in normal light conditions colors are not as vivid as they should be , there is noticeable noise and pictures came out rather soft in my point of view  .
and don't even think of using the 5x zoom because detail is lost by 25% and there is a lot of noise to be considered on the other hand the camera is amazing as video camera , best videos i have ever seen in a digital camera , but hey i want good pictures in a digital camera the camera is great looking and small , something that i would of loved as a professional skier when i go on trips , i love taking pictures up in the mountains , but i wasent going to take such a quality hit on this camera  .
i decided to try the panasonic tz3 instead , i know it's larger and heavier , and videos are not near the sony ones , but this camera deliver incredible pictures  .
lots of detail and the 10x zoom is not bad either , not to mention great low light capabilities with a fast charging flash , just something you might want to consider i believe that moments only happen once and you have one time to capture it , you might as well do it right and get it good  .
something i learned in cameras is don't go cheap , and with the tz3 at $298 on sale wasent bad , but i would of payed a lot more for it considering it's capabilities i know my review is one bad one in the middle of lots of good ones , but i know what i want and the t100 di not deliver near it  .
i still love the design and feel bad about returning it since i really wanted that camera badly , just something to consider when your about to pay $400 for a worthless camera .
so , i wonder if this review will even make it to cnet or for how long before it is taken down  .
this camera is a big disappointment  .
there is so much hype out there , especially about the high iso  .
i am an experienced photographer and i just cannot believe how bad this is  .
i think that cnet and all these sites either on sony payroll or they just fell in love with the design , 3 lcd and 5x optical zoom  .
i know that i did  .
i've had it for a week and i'm counting down the days (14) that i have before i must return it  .
calculating in the 15% restocking fee  .
this cam just doesn't measure up and it's so cool that i cannot hardly give it up  .
but i'm going to return it  .
there is noise starting at iso200  .
i have some shots at iso100 that look like crap  .
i measured against an older canon and it is better  .
my brother's casio zs700 (or something like that) is supposed to be an avg camera and its photos were better  .
outside shots are great  .
color is rich  .
zoom is nice  .
shutter lag is minimal , much better than the casio  .
however , indoor shots are crap  .
way too yellow  .
scene adjustments do not compensate  .
flash is weak  .
anything without flash is very crunchy and/or grainy  .
red eye is a huge problem even with red eye reduction activated  .
the face recognition never seems to work  .
i've seen it activated once and i've taken tons or portraits  .
man , i want to love this camera , but the photo quality is definitely below average  .
what a bummer  .
before i start let me say that i really wanted to like this camera  .
i had been waiting for a while and is happy to see it turn up  .
it is a lovely camera to get out of the box and play with and the menus etc are very easy to use  .
the crux however is that it just doesnt take good enough photos  .
to test it i took a range of photos using the appropriate auto and scene modes and bench marked them against a casio z750 and a canon ixus70  .
it is a bit of a juggle trying to use all three at the same time  .
both the casio and canon produced sharper pictures with better contrast and white balancing  .
the sony seemed to produce images that were just a bit soft or blurry  .
on the positive side , the zoom is great , it is very quick and the battery lasted very well  .
but i is always left disappointed with the results  .
the main reason i bought the camera is because the optical zoom worked while recording video  .
the footage it produced looked pretty good but it always appeared jerky and so ultimately i is left disappointed  .
perhaps i had a bad one but in the end it has gone back  .
most of the reviews for this camera seem to be positive  .
i can understand why as the unit is lovely and i think people get a bit carried away with its looks and large screen  .
but in the end you are using it for photos and i would recommend an ixus 70 over this any day  .
its smaller , as quick and takes better photos .
this is a great camera for the beginner who wants to impress his friends at a party  .
it starts up in a second and it takes great shots with super speed  .
the t    100 offers a lot of bells and whistles like 8  .
0 megapixel , super double steady shot , 3 lcd , a powerful flash , iso up to 3200 and lots of other cool toys that take too long to mention  .
however after impressing everybody you can develop your prints and find out that the pictures are not so great  .
prints from this camera are grainy , with a lot of noise and they lack color  .
just like every other cybershot super fan , i sold my older model t    9 and upgraded to the t    100  .
what a mistake  .
once i received the camera i took as many pictures as i could in every type of environment and even went as to compare its pictures to pictures taken with my old canon s80  .
i is shocked with the results  .
i compared the pictures side by side and found that the canon s80 put the sony t    100 to shame  .
the canon pictures where very well focused with great color  .
as for the t    100 sony pictures , they where lacking some color , sharpness and worst of all the pictures looked liked someone had blown sand on them grainy so in conclusion i would not advise anyone to purchase this camera unless you dot plan to print pictures larger than a 4 x 6  .
as for myself , i have already returned the t    100 to sony for a refund and i am back on the market searching for another t    9 or something that performs like it .
i have to agree with some other guys here , i am not sure how cnet did their review i came from dslr world , so all those fancy features do not impress me on these point    n    shoot    all i care is quality photos  .
i got this camera for my wife , due to the fact that we used to have a sony dsc    t3 camera which took very sharp and impressive photos  .
however , i am extremely disappointed with this t100  .
i would never buy sony point    n    shoot again  .
i am so surprised that a camera in 2004 can beat a camera in 2007 .
i purchased the t100 yesterday and returned it today  .
i looked at many reviews , mostly good and a few bad  .
majority rules , so i bought the camera first i should say that i love the design and menus on this camera but what counts most is the picture and it just wasnt good enough  .
here is what i discovered comparing images from 3 different digital cameras   my panasonic lumix dmc    fz5 (they dont make it anymore) , a friends new canon elph sd    850 , and the sony dsc    t100 i had good results taking pictures outdoors with the t100 , however i had more variation on auto than i thought i should have  .
picture quality improved when i set the iso manually  .
some minor color correction in photoshop , nothing usual , and i have some outstanding pictures indoors is another story , which is where i compared the three cameras  .
my lumix is a larger camera , not pocket size , and i know not to expect the same flash power from the other pocket cameras  .
the elph and sony t100 are competitors  .
taking the same pictures , on auto , the iso setting used by both the elph and lumix is 200  .
the sony used 800 , which results in a picture with a lot of noise  .
when i manually set the sony to 200 , i got a much better picture , but still not as sharp or detailed as the others the bottom line   i dont use manual settings very often and want a camera with outstanding quality on auto  .
the sony t100 did not deliver .
i bought this camera on the reviews (both cnet , other sites , user opinions) and is completely ready to be wow'ed by the results  .
i is at least hoping to get decent results , consistent with a good point and shoot  .
i have been trying to reconcile the results i received however , and now have to conclude , the reviews and opinions of others were based on promise , not actual results  .
i'm an avid photographer that has several camerals , include a couple slrs and numerous point and shoots  .
this is the first of my cameras that did not meet expectations , which admittedly were high photo quality is mediocre , especially in mid to low light , and it is slow to focus , often not focusing correctly  .
my sony t    9 is far superior in photo quality and shot taking process , though supposedly with 2 less megapixels  .
photos with the t100 are grainy , and last dynamic range in color which is noticible in most photos/prints  .
i would have to rank it as the least impressive camera that i've owned going back to my first digital camera , a fuji 2mp i purchased in 2001 i really wanted to like this camera , but must say i have buyers remorse  .
i'm still hoping the hd playback will win me over (have yet to try this) , but the photo quality and prints that come from this camera really are mediocre at best disappointing .
picked this camera up last week  .
have to agree with a lot of users on the site  .
the pictures on this camera stink  .
no where near as good as my old canon sd300  .
the camera has an awesome feature set , and i am really disappointed that i have to take it back , but ultimately you buy a camera for the picture quality and pics taken indoors stink  .
the auto mode jacks up the iso and the camera overcompensates the noise reduction and the pics look blotchy  .
i am ticked off that i have to pay the restocking fee , but cannot live with this camera for the $400 i just plunked down  .
going to wait for the sd850 or pick up an sd800 .
i have a sony dsc    f717 and this cam @ 5mp , takes better pics than the dsc    t100  .
the noise in every single one of the pics i take is so bad i sent it into sony for repair and it came back the same way it left  .
so if the answer to my solution is having to constantly make adjustments to the cam to fit it surrounding then what the point of point and shoot  .
i compared this to an older canon power s70 i think it is and i could not believe the canon took better pics than this $500 sony cyber shot i think my solution is simple bye bye sony hello canon .
this camera is over priced and overrated  .
i do not know how it can be rated the top camera in its class  .
c    net , i need a job , you need some qualified writers    hire me  .
the image looks like some sort of artistic effect is put on it  .
some pictures are hazy  .
color is off , even in well    lit room .
should have returned this when first purchased  .
it just does not seem to focus correctly , especially indoors when using a flash  .
maybe 1 out of 6 pictures are focused  .
i also find having the lens so high up on the camera and not in the center makes it very easy to partially block the lens with a finger  .
weak redeye reduction as well  .
think i'll go back to a canon .
i bought this camera because of its 8  .
1 mega pixels  .
the pictures i took outside were not as good as those that i take with my cybershot dsc1 with 5 mega pixels , but were still ok  .
any picture that i took inside with a flash is practically useless , too grainy , fuzzy and unclear  .
i do not recommend this camera for taking pictures  .
(as a nice toy , perhaps  .
) i do not know how cnet did .
i watched the reviews for this camera , and picked it up since it is so well reviewed  .
while it is working , it is a great point    and    click camera that we used for travel and real estate however , just recently , about 8 months after we bought it , the camera just stopped working  .
after sending it in to sony , they claimed it is corrosion damage and not covered by warranty given that we are very careful with our cameras and keep them in cases unless they are being used , i is very disappointed with sony's product and handling of the issue  .
if the camera is corroded within 8 months of normal use , then it seems it's a product issue .
the auto    focus only functions when the flash is used  .
i just got off the phone with sony technical support       this is part of the camera design and their is no way to fix it  .
also their is no manual focus  .
so if you dont use the flash this camera has no way to focus , and pictures will always be fuzzy basically unless you plan to always use flash       this is a very poor choice of camera  .
i feel this one flaw should knock this one out of editors choice .
ok ,  .
i had a canon sd 500 that is great  .
however it is 3 years old and the power supply is bad  .
so i researched consumer reports , dp review and cnet the salesman in circuit city said this is his best camera  .
it is i think one of the only cameras that is able to zoom in video mode i am returning the camera tomorrow because    .
in order to navigate from picture mode to video mode you need to    .
press the home menu button  .
scroll down to video  .
select video  .
exit the home menu here are some more negatives    .
the menu's are far from intuitive the pictures are grainy camera is unable to maunually or automatically properly adjust the white balance to energy saving fluorescent lights sony's proprietary memory stick is not compatable with the rest of society's sd slots sony's proprietary usb camera connection is flimsy but most of all    .
the picture's are bad i'm going to buy the lumix    tz1 (old model) tomorrow  .
note   the new version , tz3 is unable to zoom in video mode  .
the tz1 can df  .
face detection is a big joke  .
i cannot believe sony is selling this camera and claiming the excellant focus when it does not work properly  .
i am taking it back and buying something more resonable for this type of point and shoot i have used 100 cameras that focus better  .
sony t100 sucks for focusing  .
i am upset because all of my daughter prom pictures are soft  .
you cannot tell in the playback of the camera but when youblow them up it is not focused on the subjects nice try sony but you definately have a problem with this camera  .
caller the sony store and i am not the only one complaining  .
i'm a sony freak  .
i have a sony tv , dvd    r , vcr , dc    10 (mini dv camcorder) , etc  .
i would not buy this camera again if i knew what i know now  .
i doubt sony will make any future models better  .
it's a horrible model .
we've finally figured out how to take decent indoor pictures , but in order to do it we have to put it in a mode that disables most of the advanced features (face detection etc  .
cnet really let me down with this review  .
they were the primary reason i bought this camera as a point an shoot  .
turns out the auto mode is completely useless  .
almost never takes a useful picture  .
we spend more time trying to adjust the modes than we do taking pictures  .
please cnet take the time to take pictures in a variety of environments before recommending a camera  .
the first time you tried shooting indoors you would have found the massive short commings of this camera  .
i bought this camera to upgrade from my canon sd300  .
there is absolutely no comparison between the 2 cameras  .
the sony cybershot dsc    t100 took pictures that constantly appeared blurry and orange  .
i tired every possible combination of settings and eventually gave up  .
bought a canon sd750 (which costs much less) , charged the battery , and snapped away  .
i am absolutely floored at how poor the pciture quality of the sony was  .
i have been taking pictures of my 2 young children for years and picture quality is critical for me  .
the picture browser software turns red    eye into green eye  .
having read cnet reviews for many years , and used those reviews in influencing my decision in most of my purchases , including three digital cameras  .
i now realize that whoever reviews digital cameras for cnet has very little concept or understanding of digital cameras  .
you only have to compare cnet reviews with those of dedicated camera web sites to realize this i have now decided to base my buying decisions on the score given by other reviewers  .
check it out yourself , if you haven't already noticed the hundreds of reviews that start with i do not now which camera cnet is reviewing , it was not the same one i have  .
i am sorry , everyone is entitled to their opinion , but when i read numerous reviews by a camera expert , then find those views contradicted by the reviews of users and other professional camera reviewers , i start to doubt the ability of cnet's reviewer the fuji s9100 is another example  .
cnet's view is though high on features , fuji's fine pix s9100 comes up short on image quality  .
yet every other amateur and professional reviewer found the image quality the leader in it's field and price range , with 90% of those reviews giving a 9 or 10 score , against cnet's 7  .
4 i believe that many buyers like me were swayed by cnet giving this camera it's highest accolade and score this camera is ok , not great , in well lit outdoor situations , but is horrible indoors , both in well lit and in low lit situations , flash photographs over six feet away , twilight and night shots with and without a tripod  .
i am an advanced photo enthusiast , i read the manuals , practice with all the features , etc  .
but on a recent vacation i is not able to print one 8x10 that is shot in anything but perfect outdoor conditions  .
all the other photos were noisy , soft , fuzzy photos that looked like they were taken by a five year old with a $20 camera  .
my 6 year old pentax takes photos that are 10x better just in case you are in any doubt that the problem might be my ability or my camera  .
my 30 year old son accompanied us , and he also has the t100 , which he bought after reading cnet's review , and all his photo's were equally poor quality choose something else , and base your choice on user reviews not cnets hit or miss approach .
theres something terrible wrong with that camera , it has to be recalled and fixed , i took amazing pictures with the older t10 , thats the main reason that i buy the t100  .
the quality of the pictures its not bad , its awful , its not like little difference from t10 when you enlarge the picture , its terrible grainy and blurry all the way i want my money back  .
i had bought the t20 for a vacation a few weeks ago , and it took some great day pictures  .
however , the minute i got inside and i took the flash off or even lowered it , the pictures looked horrible  .
night time shots also , and the flash is incredibly weak  .
my father is using a much older sony 3  .
1 mp camera and his shots were coming out sharper  .
and i payed $400 plus for this thing  .
i figured it is the camera , so i returned it for the t100 thinking it has to be better  .
nope , same problem  .
the minute you change the flash , you get the constant camera shake warning , even if you're perfectly stil , the picture come out blurry this is even in a moderately lit room  .
sometimes even with the flash , the pictures were soft , when you zoomed in  .
before i took it back i purchased the canon 750 and 850 is  .
both cameras blew away the sony in terms of picture clarity and indoor/night time pictures i even setup all the cameras on a table with the timer , and the t100 pictures looked terrible compared to the canons  .
blotchy , soft messes on indoor shots  .
it great for the outdoors , but most people take indoor shots , at least i know i do most of my night time flash shots showed those white dots , which i know is typical with these small cameras , but the canons seem to not have the problem as often the menu system is also a little annoying to navigate , especially if you want to switch to a different scene , image size , or exposure setting i really wanted to like this camera as it looks fantastic , and the 3 screen is fantastic , but the camera is not worth the money  .
look at the reviews aroung the net on this thing , and you'll see this camera has issues shame on sony for not testing it out better , and shame on cnet for leaving this part out  .
if they did it on purpose , then they lose more and more credibility each day  .
if they did not even bother testing taking pictures indoors , then why bother having a review section if you're not going to fully test out the products you showcase  .
btw , i stuck with the 750  .
it took great pictures , has gotten fantastic reviews , and looks much nicer than than the 850 is .
i is shocked to see that my 400 euro camera had this big big problem when shooting indoor pictures  .
in some instances where the light is low , you just can not see the faces that look like old amiga sprites this camera should have been withdrawn from the market and get fixed  .
sony qc department should re    check this problem especially when there are tons of customer complaints through the internet this issue is brought to the attention of sony customer service and their answer is that since their is no technical problem we just can not do anything to help you  .
in other words if the customer is totally unsatisfied and their is no technical problem they just do not care if you need a camera for outdoor shots only then buy it  .
otherwise , just forget it and look for something else .
had camera for 2 months and it stopped working  .
repair shop stated that corrosion is the issue and it is irreparable  .
sony stated that because it is corrosion , it is not covered under warranty and also voided the warranty entirely i previously had a dsc    p8 and loved it  .
the only reason i picked up this one is because i lost it during a trip  .
i used both cameras in the same environment and never had an issue with the p8  .
humidity is never a factor so is hard to understand exactly how much moisture is really needed to cause the camera to stop functioning  .
two months and $400 is flushed away .
