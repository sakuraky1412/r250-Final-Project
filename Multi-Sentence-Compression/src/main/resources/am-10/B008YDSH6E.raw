Having used Supco relays for over 30 years when they first became available,  I have always found them to be reliable and they saved me from carrying 40 or 50 types of relays in my truck.
They exceed the original device and very easy to install.
Worked great!! I just wonder how long they last.
I have been a technician since 1971.
