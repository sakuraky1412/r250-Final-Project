i was surprised to the good side with this hotel .
not that i expected something not being ok ( thanks to other ta-reviews ) , but because i kind of had expected something older and more worn down , which is absolutely not the case .
the hotel is old with a great/funny/telling history board on the wall in the bar , but everything is nice , clean and in perfect working order - plenty of hot water with the right pressure , the furniture on the wonderful rooftop terrace looks brand new , the elevators also looks brand new etc .
etc .
generally all the tipoffs of an old hotel was absolutely not in sight , and we would gladly stay here again .
on the down side : i actually think the staff was helpful , but not very smiling .
the older guy at the reception was all smiles , when we came back in from a trip in the city etc .
, but regarding the other reception staff - well , you could enter the hotel without the receptionist on duty looking up and 'welcoming ' you back with a smile .
basically you felt that you kind of sneaked in - but nothing that ca n't be helped with just a little extra attention .
i 'm not much of a breakfast eater , so for me the very simple buffet style breakfast is just a thing to be done with .
it did cover the basics for me with toast , ham and cheese .
nice things to know : - the . . .
