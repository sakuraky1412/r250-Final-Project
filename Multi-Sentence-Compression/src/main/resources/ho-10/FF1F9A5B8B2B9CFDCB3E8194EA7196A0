we complained and even the manager i spoke with agreed it was terrible- we were given a free meal in the lovely top floor a la carte restaurant but unless they change the mix of clientele this hotel will not see us return despite its many positives.
when i booked this holiday it clearly stated that cildren were not allowed at the hotel - that has now changed and the place is swarming with kids - quite honestly the portugese seem to have at least three small children each and another on the way .

food was really good and there is a fantastic gym at another hotel on the resort you can pay to use .

its really difficult to describe as every hotel we have ever stayed at has a mix of ages nationalities etc but this place must have been made up of 95 % locals with children- were they getting a special offer ?
thats the good bit- the bad bit is what ruined our holiday and left us stressed to the point we were considering leaving .

the easy bit- this hotel is fantastic to look at its part of a huge multi hotel resort in a beautuful spot near a stunning beach .
