most of us was in a standard room , 2 per room and made it our home for the almost 2 weeks we were there .
however the sky terrace that adjoined the meeting room , where they spread out our coffee/tea breaks , twice a day , gave us a great view , great cross wind and a great place to get together after class for late night discussions and doing team projects .
the beach was also a great place to see beautiful sunrises in the morning and we can walk along the beach for kilometers on end . . .
all in all , it was a good place for us to stay , had a great view , great beach to walk and run on , and very tropical feel to it .
the meeting room although had a great view to the beach from the 5th floor , had only 2 bathrooms and were always short on tissue and paper towels and when everyone rushed to use it during break , always seemed short on water .
the lunch menu ( part of the meeting package ) and the tea breaks was changed everyday , just a few dishes to choose from but the taste was good .
the hotel is located on the tanjung benoa beach strip and boasted a 70 meter pool that was great for swimming laps in .
every morning however , about 5 am the cleaning crew would start dragging out the equipments to clean the pool and beach area and can cause a lot of noise as they dragged their carts etc . . .
the beds was comfortable enough and made for a good night sleep after a long day of class .
the bathroom had a shower area that joined the toilet and the sink , so it can get pretty wet even with the shower curtains drawn .
