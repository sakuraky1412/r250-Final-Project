i have stayed in many of the hotels in central manchester and this is the most unusual - pleasantly so .
it is an old victorian building that retains many original features but its decoration and furnishings are very modern .
my room had the largest bed i have ever seen ( and am most unlikely to ever use ) but i would have preferred a smaller one and wardrobe , because all i had was a hanging rail and i dont really want visitors to see all of my clothes .
the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and there was a well stocked hot drinks tray as well as what i think they call a 'tuck box ' with snacks and drinks they charge for .
the staff at the reception and elsewhere were excellent .
i had a problem with the air conditioning unit and they quickly brought me a replacement remote control .
there is a problem with the lift - it is slow and the the indicator lights did not work , so i had no idea whether it was on its way or not .
however the original victorian staircase is wide and full of tile and window features .
breakfast was excellent - except the pieces of melon had been cut to include sections of the hard rind and the pineapple pieces were full of prickly 'eyes ' .
it is not difficult to cut melon and pineapple properly and at these prices that is how i expect . . .
