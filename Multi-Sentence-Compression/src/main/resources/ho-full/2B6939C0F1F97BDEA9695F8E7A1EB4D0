pickup arranged by the hotel : no assistance with luggage and no bottled water offered despite costing 13,500lkr check in : we checked in after midnight , there was no check in process but ushered into loft suite 3 quickly with no introduction to the room etc loft suite 3 : arrangement of the room , bedroom upstairs with toilet and shower downstairs was a bit odd .
cupboard only had 1 hanger , the toilet and shower resembled the ones in my army barracks 20 years ago .
the shower head handle was flaking and the toilet flush button was corroded and needed quite a bit of effort to depress it .
only 1 bathrobe for 2 persons .
coffee and tea sachets were good , nice spa ceylon shampoo and soap .
aircon was relatively quiet and new and worked well .
staff and manager : generally helpful staff , especially when we complained that wifi did n't work , the trainee manager managed to get another router in the room , big thumbs up .
manager is seen walking round breakfast time , but oddly seem to only speak to guests when they leave .
we requested for extended check out but the whole episode was quite messy , staff had to go back and forth from the manager who probably could have come out to manage it .
as much as an extra hour check out is a privilege not a right , it was frustrating to switch from one room to another and then another !
overall an average . . .
