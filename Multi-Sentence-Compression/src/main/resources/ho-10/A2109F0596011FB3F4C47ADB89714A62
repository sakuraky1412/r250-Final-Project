we ate most of our meals at la citronnelle ( buffet ) could not be faulted , there is something for everyone and the head chef noel has got to be congratulated on the food and his staff , notably sattish the egg and omelette man and the lady on the fresh fruit counter at breakfast .
our room was a junior suite which we had been upgraded to but whatever you have booked , they are all fitted out with all mod cons , and if you happen to be beach front , the views are to die for .
if you enjoy your golf this resort will take some beating , two great courses the legend and the links both well maintained and challenging in different ways .
what really makes the golf though are the caddy masters who are wonderful guys and go out of their way to ensure you enjoy your golfing time .
i would just like to mention some of the caddy masters who give up a lot of their own free time to run the competitions they are dhanish , sarran , mario , adish , gio , andre , kumar , swadish , ravi , kavi , kavish , miguel , rakesh , alex , sebastian , jason and all the others - thanks guys !
if you dine at the deer hunter you could well see a herd of deer in the evening light pass quietly around the 18th green which is a definite must not to miss !
on a tuesday they hold a texas scramble on the links course , shotgun start , and back to symons ( a local bar and restaurant ) for food , drinks and a prize presentation , absolutely fabulous !
we were made so welcome , and as we walked around the resort the staff were always very friendly and went out of their way to say hello and smile .
we also ate at the deer hunter , indigo , and la spiaggia .
afterwards back to the deer hunter for drinks and a prize presentation - donâ€™t miss either comp .
