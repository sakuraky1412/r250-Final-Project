( this is probably a good time to use this hotel before the prices rocket ) the bathroom is small but has a really nice shower with plenty of room , although i cant help noticing that the fixtures are a bit cheap and flimsy .

the floors are laminate and the decor is clean and bright but there are still a few things that are not working properly due to the fact its a very new hotel .

the bedrooms were quite small , and make sure you ask for a room with a window that opens or you will get a small room/tiny window .

the staff are very polite and the general feel is relaxed but when they lost my laundry i couldnt help feel that they may be a little too chilled .
the restaurant is located on the 1st floor but we were n't impressed with the food at all and chose to eat out most nights .
