Pros:. Everything you need in a GPS for $150.00. 
Cons:. Nothing, may be the battery. 
Summary:. This CNET review is based on the old TomTom one. As we speak, a newest revision is out (3rd revision) and can be bought at Walmart for $148.99. This model gets rave reviews (even on CNET although the editor has not reviewed it). Why spend over $300 on other makes when TomTom one 3rd edition does it all? I love mine!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Price for a Great TomTom One at www.SDcommodities.com. 
Cons:. Cant think on any - Just Great. 
Summary:. I bought this for my wife for her birthday because she is always traveling and tends to get lost. This GPS is very accurate. She enjoys using it to find gas stations and restaurants on her road trips. The Tom Tom one also can locate many different points of interest as well. It is a great buy. I shopped around and finally made my purchase on-line at SDcommodities.com. They were the cheapest compared to anyone else on-line. I had my GPS in 2 days. I even called them with a question and their customer service was very helpful. 718-921-9100.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Portability, Ease of Use. 
Cons:. love it all. 
Summary:. I have been searching around for a GPS that suits me for quite a while. I hadn't settled on one in particular, and I've never used a GPS device before, so I wanted to play around. I borrowed the TomTom ONE, and am so far so pleased with it - from the minute I opened the box, it was ready to use and easy. It's so small, which is great for me since I do a lot of traveling and my roommate and I can share it and switch it from car to car easily on long trips. I really don't have enough good things to say about the ONE.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear and accurate voice commands. 
Cons:. If you dont own one you will waste your money with another brand.. 
Summary:. Thank you Tomnd tom one, for saving me. I no longer get lost when I travel for business and especially at night. I used to get lost and wind up in some bad neiborhoods, not anymore - thanks TOMTOM ONE and Thanks www.sdcommodities.com for getting me the best price around and for your quick shipping. If anyone is interested in the TOMTOM ONE call 718-921-9100 for the best deal.. 

$$;
Pros:. service dept. first class. 
Cons:. some rural house #'s not available. 
Summary:. I bought my tomtom from e-bay seller, when unit arrived the car charger did not work. One phone call to tomtom 800# and within minutes their service dept.had a new charger shipped to my address. Unit was a refurbished gps and came with a one year warr. What peace of mind the service dept.gave I will recomend this company to everyone. Very satisfied customer!!!!!!!!!!1. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, good GPS reception. 
Cons:. No SD slot in latest version. 
Summary:. The Tom Tom One seems to come in various versions. Be sure of which one you are getting, some seem to have maps of only the 48 states and Canada, others throw in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam.. I had originally bought the version 3, took it back and got a version 2. the version 3 had no SD slot to add maps, other than deleting the internal map and then uploading a new map. The version 2 has the North America maps built in along with the SD slot for any future maps, such as Europe, you wish to add later. Version 3 did have the ability to add an external traffic radio (subscription required), that I wouldn't have used anyway, but lacked an external GPS antenna jack. Version 2 also supported Bluetooth, for data features only, NOT for use as a speakerphone. This feature seems to have been dropped from Version 3, which seems to be an attempt to offer a "budget" version.. No matter which version you get you can update the firmware to add most, if not all the latest features and you are able to update the internal map, to the latest, for up to a 30 day period after you have registered with TomTom.. To upload anything to the unit you have to install TomTom Home on your computer and set up an account. You are able to download new voices, many for no charge, as well as other features. I found customer service to be second to none, almost no wait to talk to a rep.. I've owned a number of GPS units, some going back over 10 years, most Garmin and Magellan. I have to say that this unit has the best signal pickup by far. I have mine mounted down by the centre console and it picks up a strong signal without having to be in the window. Very fast signal aqusition time too.. A firmware upgrade added the auto off feature which shuts the unit down when it detects loss of power from the lighter plug.. The only thing that it seems to be lacking is auto switch to night mode, you have to change that yourself, odd, since it knows what time it is and my Garmin iQue, which is much older does it for me.. The antenna jack seems to support external antennas made for Garmin, both of mine worked just fine, but unless I'm about 5 feet away from a window, it just doesn't need it.. It does lack the reading out of street names , but since I've never had that, i don't miss it.. I haven't tried the unit on the battery, when walking, the unit isn't really designed for that but it does offer a "walking" mode. I assume that this doesn't anchor you to a road on the map. I've found that if you drive down a lane, between two roads, the unit assumes you are on one of the roads and moves your "arrow" to one of those roads.. These units have been on sale as of late, some going for as low as $129 to $149 in the pre and post Christmas sales.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek, exceptionally functional, ready to go out of box. 
Cons:. Lacking "multimedia" features (but, did I want to buy a navigation GPS or an iPod?). 
Summary:. For the past year or so, I've shyed away from the Navigation GPS market due to the high cost of the devices and the assumed potential for "subscription fees". However, tonight I saw the TomTom One unit in Best Buy for only $130. When I asked the sales associate what kind of "fees" the device required and to my pleasant surprise he said "None!" I threw caution to the wind and picked it up. My pleasant surprise continued when I sat down in my car, opened the package, turned it on, typed in my home address and was essentially 100% up and running! If you're just looking for a GPS Nav system, this is the most cost effective option, and it's got absolutely everything you could need. (And, yes there are in fact some extra subscription-based options traffic, weather, buddy list with instant messenger, etc. which I haven't taken advantage of, but look like they may be worth it if you want to spend the money.) Other than that, it's practically idiot-proof, and perfect for beginners ... but, again I can't really see ever needing more than what this provides in terms of options and functionality. (And the included window mount is light, ergonomic and small enough to stow in the glove compartment with the device.) Buy one now!. 

$$;
Pros:. quick and easy for those who dont have lots of time to figure out just one more thing in this life. 
Cons:. I believe there should be short cuts when doing a search for food or things along the way, they maybe such a thing and I dont know about it?. 
Summary:. NJ middle of the day, I bought the Tom Tom plugged and found all of my destination within a few minutes even my contact person was surprised, asked if I knew the area?. My philosphy is to keep it simple. This Tom Tom fits that thought to a T. (no pun intended lol). 

$$;
Pros:. extremely accurate. 
Cons:. difficult mount.

$$;
Pros:. Great Price and Easy to Use. 
Cons:. Better Method of Mounting. 
Summary:. I bought the TomTom One yesterday and put it to good use today. I had to take my wife to Atlanta for medical test at a large complex with many medical buildings. Have been there a couple of other times and always got lost. I put in the address of the medical building were I needed to go and the TomTom One took me straight to the location.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy To Use. 
Cons:. Low Battery Life. 
Summary:. It would not let us get lost on a trip to Florida. For the price, it does what it is supposed to do. The touchscreen is large enough and mounting is not a problem. The One is a good basic gps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple operation, Durable, Nice Design, Very Functional. 
Cons:. Poor internal battery life. 
Summary:. I bought mine for my wife (she has no sense of direction), then after using it when we went on vacation, and moved to rural East Texas, we've come to depend on it every trip into the surrounding area.. It can be used to plot direction and your location, always making sure it gets you where you need to go. With just a little reading and practice, this moderately priced GPS unit can save you bundles of money at the gas pumps.. With Bluetooth capability, plus a slew of options, anyone considering a GPS for their car travel would do good to get one!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and great value. 
Cons:. Case is extra. Longer battery life.. 
Summary:. Used Tom Tom One in Metropolitan DC area and on a trip to Montreal and Quebec City. Performed perfectly. No complaints. Mounting device is excellent.. 

$$;
Pros:. A Breeze to use out of the box. 
Cons:. It from the British for gosh sakes. 
Summary:. A piece of cake to use and it's accuracy surprised me. I use it for business travel and in 9 months has not led me wrong. It is bare bones and was exactly what I was looking for, a "grusomely efficient" inexpensive GPS unit. Only disappointment is in the battery life. For less than $300, I'd do it over and over again. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to operate out of the box, finds location very fast.. 
Cons:. Blue tooth does seem to connect to E815 Motorola phones.. 
Summary:. I use my TOM TOM for Real Estate and have found it does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have also found the mounting bracket every easy to operate. Screen is extremely clear and the maps in my area of North Carolina are very accurate. So far I am delighted with the TOM TOM 1. Though it doesn't display speed or have a barometer I find this is no hinderance. Great Product for the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. 
Cons:. you need good eye sight to identify small point of interest markers. 
Summary:. This is my first time with a road GPS and I am very impressed with the accuracy of directions. On a 3000 mile trip, it made only one mistake. It had a Flying J located on the wrong side of I-95 at exit 29 in Georgia. Voice to text would have been nice, but not worth $100 more. It tells you which way you are turning with the first alert 2 miles away, then second alert 1 mile away, then 3rd alert 1/2 mile away, then more alerts as turn approaches. This is very nice as you don't get caught in the wrong lane on crowded interstate highways. When the unit could not find my daughter's address in a remote location in the western part of the US where the zip code puts you 20 miles from her residence, I used the Tiger system of the Government to find the exact latitude and longitude coordinates, then entered them into the TomTom. The TomTom found her and gave her road on the display and the exact location. I was very impressed by this feature. The points of interest data base needs some work as TomTom did not know what I was trying to navigate to for Zion National Park, but did know Yellowstone. I would hope the company will make some downloadable corrections to their database and a mechinism for TomTom users to submit corrections and Points of interest that would then be downloadable. I rate this unit a 9 and can not see where features in more expensive GPS units are worth the money. For basic navigation, I would rate this unit a 9.7. 

$$;
Pros:. very user friendly, thin, good maps. 
Cons:. no text to voice. 
Summary:. I've been using a TomTom ONE for a while and I've been really happy with it, its very clear and easy to use without even needing to read the manual.. 

$$;
Pros:. very easy to use; lots of built in memory; good GPS Signal. 
Cons:. Small screen; Needs a better speaker; PQIs are kind of out dated. 
Summary:. I really like the tom tom one!!!!. its really easy to use and it does exactly what it needs to do. the GPS signal stregnth is always good and it really shows a change in location. The Tom Tom One is worth the money!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Best price on the Internet. 
Cons:. None if you buy from WWW.SDCOMMODITIES.COM. 
Summary:. Wow - What a fantastic unit the TomTom one is. I have it for only 5 days so far and I love it. I owned a Garmin and Lowrance before but this one takes the cake. Just so remarkable compared to others - I got a great Deal at WWW.SDcommodities.com they are the lowest anywhere on the internet. Call them first if your ready to buy at 718-921-9100. I am buying one for my Mom for Mothers Day - she will love it. Makes a great Gift.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good visibility. Solid Mounting. Turn by turn directions are good.. 
Cons:. Never quite gets you to the door step.. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS. I have had it for about two weeks and am so far very happy with it. I had an issue with the TomTom Home software. Submitted a request to TomTom and had response the next day. (D/L latest version of Home software.) Did it and all was well. I like the intuitive nature of the design and find it easy to use. I wish the pasenger in my car could give as good directions. (Too use to hearing "turn back there") Also found it to be up to date on the newest road in my area.. Only issue is it never quite gets you exactly to the doorstep. I played with it getting directions to places I already know. Found several map errors in small towns. I just keep send in the details to help make them better in the future.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate,easy to use.. 
Cons:. No home charger, must use USB.. 
Summary:. Bought a Garmin c550 for $500, because of the reputation Garmin has. Swapped for the TomTom One, saved over $200, and I like it better. The TomTom maps are more accurate her in NJ. Is capable of many waypoints, Garmin has one waypoint. The TomTom has itenerary planning, you can make a route with as many stops as you want. The TomTom is very accurate. Garmin was always about 50-100 feet behind on screen. TomTom is dead-on. The only thing I don't like is when in menu or settings, when a selection is made, it takes you back to the navi screen.. This unit is a great GPS for a small investment.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Interface. 
Cons:. Battery life. 
Summary:. The first thing I did when I got it out of the box is to program the gal with the English accent into my Tom Tom. This is now my favorite gadget. Now I can go anywhere and not get lost LOL!!!!! Easy to use and had it up and running in 10 minutes. I Love my TOM TOM!!!!!. Mitch from NJ. 

$$;
Pros:. As advertised, out of the box and operational in about a minute. 
Cons:. Mount a bit awkward but functional. 
Summary:. This is the "apple" in a PC world... not complicated, intuitive, extremely user friendly. I was able to power up and cold start calculate a route in about a minute. I dared ask for an alternate route and bam, there we are. Accurate directions, good voice prompts (audible and clear)... and I may be imagining here but I think the voice prompt sound level increases with speed to compensate for road noise. Good deal. For someone who doesn't need something else to amuse them - i.e., mp3, phone, et al - this is it, directions to anywhere in a box.. 

$$;
Pros:. The TT One is extremely user friendly (Anyone can use it no matter their tech experience), its portable, and has some of the most detailed/accurate maps of the US following the recent TT map update.. 
Cons:. No complaints. 
Summary:. The TT one is great for someone that wants a quality gps unit that you can also use outside of the car!. 

$$;
Pros:. AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE. 
Cons:. THERE ARE NONE. 
Summary:. THE TOMTOM ONE IS GREAT UNIT / MY EMPLOYEE'S DO ALOT OF TRAVELING AND I HAVE PURCHASED MANY GPS UNITS FOR THEM, BUT TOMTOM ONE IS A WINNER. I PURCHASE ALL MY GPS UNITS AT WWW.SDCOMMODITIES.COM , THEY ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST DEALS, AND WILL MATCH ANYONES PRICES. CALL THEM FIRST AT 718-921-9100 IF YOU LIKE TO SAVE MONEY.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gets me to where I need to go. 
Cons:. Window Mount. 
Summary:. I love this product. I travel extensively during the winter and this product gets me to where I need to be. If you have been some where before it may not give you the route you would take but it has successfully taken me to places 3 hours away that I have never been too.. I would be ware of the window mount. I put it on like stated and after about 3 hours it fell off the window and put a big gash in the interface. The unit was broke. I did get it replaced after much hassling with the best buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Interface, easy mount, helpful directions.. 
Cons:. Map updates should come through software automatically.. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS, so I can't give comparisons, but this device works great for me. Routes are good, verbal prompts give enough information without constant chatter, and maps are clear. While it doesn't say street names for turns, these are easy to find on the display, and hasn't been a draw-back for me. The features are extensive, but you can start simple and learn as you go. While some routes have been questionable, it has actually shown me some short-cuts I would never have found on my own.. As for inaccurate maps, mine have been pretty current. TomTom also provides a free update that is coming in the mail. I have to wonder if some people having problems haven't updated their maps or software through the computer.. My biggest complaint is that the PC Interface doesn't automatically download and install available updates to maps when you register. Software is updated, but not maps. These are shipped on DVD. It would be more convenient if it would "synchronize" the device to the latest maps, maybe monthly. They could charge a fee, and it would solve some problems.. Can't comment on "Plus" services--just haven't felt a need. Its nice to have the option for later.. 

$$;
Pros:. EXCELLENT ACCURATE NAVIGATION, CLEAR SCREEN , VOICE IS GREAT AND LOUD. 
Cons:. WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE POI'S BUT YOU CAN ADD THEM AT LEAST AS YOU GO!. 
Summary:. I first purchased a MIO C310X after the holidays and thought I loved it. Then we got this one last minute on a good deal and decided to compare. This won by a landslide. The Mio in town consistently tried to route me ways that did not make sense to the quickest or shortest routes. This one, perfect. The voice was louder on this one and you could change the voices. On the mio you got 1 voice. It is nice until you realize how much nicer it CAN be when you use the TOMTOM. Customer service? I had a question...they answered it ok, THEN called ME back because the guy had another idea he wanted me to try....WOW!!! I was amazed I was thought about AFTER my service call was done. More map updates have just been released. You can ADD POI'S...I did and it was EASY!! I LOVE THIS THING...SIMPLE, DOES A GREAT NAVIGATING JOB HERE IN TOWN and FREEWAY....AMAZING SUPPORT.....Battery life is supposed to be only 2 hours, but with car charger and the fact it will charge off the USB I have not ran out of battery power yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, light and nice looking. 
Cons:. CNET isn't doing well explaining the minutia. 
Summary:. I cannot see how this unit interfaces to a headset or external amplifier. If it's an MP3 player, they sure hid the output well. Can anyone comment on this? I'm only lost 5% of the time, but I want music 99% of the time, so this is a detail I need to know.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works great, quick setup. 
Cons:. Won't connect via bluetooth with my phone. 
Summary:. I bought this unit today at a Black Friday Sale and I love it already. I've taken 3 short little trips and it has been perfect. The maps and poi seem up to date and the screen is easy to read.. The mounting bracket is short, but I don't need to be messing with the unit while driving so it keeps me safe by being short.. The supplied Tom Tom software is really good and enables you to do lots of stuff. There's even a feature that lets you plan out routes and then load them on your TomTom. The only drawback is it won't connect to my phone via bluetooth.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, intuitive. 
Cons:. Battery life a little short.. 
Summary:. As an entry level device, it does everything you'd want it to, and easily.. 

$$;
Pros:. Thin compare to any navi's I have seen and very affordable. 
Cons:. It doesn't turn on 80% of the time. 
Summary:. I just got this 4 weeks ago and sometimes it won't turn on. I keep resetting it for it to turn on. Am I doing something wrong? If it would just turn on I'll give it 10/10 but I don't know help!. 

$$;
Pros:. Advanced Navigation Features. 
Cons:. Battery life a bit low. 
Summary:. When you actually compare the navigation features of the One to the Garmin Nuvi there is no comparison, the One can save routes, have multiple vias (multiple stops in a route) and a functional detour button along with tons of other customization. ALL of these things are missing from the nuvi line, which in some cases is double the cost of the One and provides a very dumbed down user experience.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. POI DB not as big as I would like. 

$$;
Pros:. Have had this unit for about 3 weeks now and just took a trip to Oregon. The unit worked extremely well and the directions we very accurate. I also bought a Garmin Nuvi 265W and in my opinion the Tom Tom blew the Garmin away. 
Cons:. No text to speech on this unit which I did not find to be a problem.. 
Summary:. This is a great unit especially for the price. The software was extremely easy to use and the interface on the unit is better than the Garmin in my opinion. I had alot of trouble with the Garmin software and web site. I would highly recommend this unit for an entry level unit and I like it better than my more expensive Garmin 265W. 

$$;
Pros:. Great navigation, simple to use, 3D view, very portable, super quick start up, map sharing, easy to add pois.. 
Cons:. No restaurant categories, no text-to-speach. 
Summary:. I travel all over the U.S. every week and I was going to buy a Garmin or Mio, but got the TomTom One 3rd Edition as a Christmas gift. I was not considering TomTom because of the lack of restraunt categories and no text-to-speech. I found that I could get over those hurdles. Considering that you can get this GPS for $150, it is so worth the money. I don't know why anyone would buy the Nuvi 200 over this, nor why anyone would pay $200 more just for text-to-speech. It is really unecessary to hear your GPS mispronouncing the street names... You can mount this little puppy a little below line of sight and see all the turns clearly. The POIs are so easy to add, all you have to do is place them in the map photos after you download them from one of many free poi sights. I highly recommend this for those who need a GPS. If you need all that other junk, that's what an iPOD is for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice functionality and design. 
Cons:. Volume could be a bit louder. 
Summary:. I had to "fix" mine right out the fox. Apparently a bad batch of these things were shipped out just prior to Christmas.... and I got one of 'em. After initial use, these things would have to be "reset" every time after being powered off. Without the reset, it would only display a white screen when powered on. Imagine having to reset it EVERYTIME you powered it off. Tom Tom has provided a fix on their web site that has to be downloaded to the unit. The fix seems to have worked on mine so far but I just applied it last night so the jury is still out. Other than that, I'm satisfied. I rated it an 8 assuming the "white screen" issue is just a correctable glitch that sometimes happens with electronics.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to use; easy to set up; easy to teach. 
Cons:. battery only lasts 2 hours. 
Summary:. Lets face it.. the reason you need a GPS is to avoid getting lost. This solves it.. I've had this unit for a year--been all across the US and Canada with it and works wonderfully!. Simple to use---and easy to teach your 'significant other' how to use it.. Would have liked it if the battery lasted longer so you can use it while on walks.... Great that you can download other voices... especially having Denis Hopper tell you what direction youre going!. If you want flash and things like MP3 players etc.. dont get this --but consider that you'll likely never use those features... great product!. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to set up directions are loud and clear screen is easy to view never a problem with glare or anything like that. 
Cons:. battery seems to run down a little fast when not in charger. 
Summary:. I used this to go from New Jersey to Conneticutt and it worked great easy to program and gives directions loud and clear. screen is easy to view no problems with glare or anything. If you like simple and efficient this is a buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. small,very intuitive. 
Cons:. customer support sucks. 
Summary:. Since I bought the unit 4 months ago I have used it on several occasions with no problems. . Problem is the map share feature must have ver 6.75 and my unit is 6.65 so I can not use mapshare. When I contacted TomTom asking for a map upgrade they said free upgrades are only available on units purchased less than 30 days before. I believe for good customer service there should be at least a 1 year upgrade period. This type of service may influence my next decision should I buy a new gps. Too bad because so far this unit is good.. 

$$;
Pros:. new OS offers v3 capabilities. 
Cons:. tech support has a lot to overcome. 
Summary:. I recently purchased a TomTom One v2 with standard screen. Since I purchased it, I have had it upgraded (by the new version of TomTom Home) to include a new operating system and the new MapShare that came out with v3.. All in all, I am pleased with the device. There are some things that do not function as advertised but it is a spectacular machine in a small package. The only thing that is serious is that it is possible to bypass the security password with little trouble making it ever more a target for thieves if it is left in the car. For those that are concerned about the mounting problem with v1, that has been corrected. I have no problems mounting it, warm or cold windshield.. What I do not like about it is the dearth of knowledge from the Support staff in the US especially a person named Jeremy. To this day, he insists that it is impossible for me to have MapShare on this GPS. Before the new OS was downloaded with MapShare included with it, other support techs had told me (though email) that TomTom was not going to port it over to v2 from v3. Obviously, there are people that did not read the memo.. Would I recommend it to a new buyer? Yes, if you are technically inclined and can do without support or with incorrect answers to your questions. Besides, the v3 price is down to euro 199.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the user interface, not as dumbed down as Garmin's, POIs showing on the navigation map is a nice touch, more information available to user on one screen than comparable Garmins. 
Cons:. The maps simply are not as good as the NAVTEQs, only can see POI phone # when "browsing map", no auto switch from day screen to night screen (3rd party freeware fixes this). 
Summary:. I based my decision based on the features the unit gives me. I recently bought my ONE version 4 and have loved it from the get go. My ONE did not come with an SD card as all of the memory is internal. It still has the SD slot, although I'm told that it will only run off of either the card or the internal memory, so it's not like you can pop a bunch of custom features on a SD card and run the main maps off the internal memory (Why TomTom didn't plan for that, I have no explanation). The maps and POI databases are not as complete as the Garmin's, but they are still very complete and more than capable of getting you where you need to go. I have had no problem getting to places I have never been before with this unit. I have a V4 with the 6.65 map version (most up to date) and I have yet to have the unit tell me to go down a one way street the wrong way, etc, etc. The routes it picks around my home are usually spot on, and the alternate routing capability of this unit is head and shoulders above the Garmins I looked at. The planning feature is really cool as well, giving you the shortest/best route between multiple locations. I don't plan on using the TomTomPLUS features, but the availability is nice, and it sync'd right up with my bluetooth phone for wireless service if I wanted to use it (no handsfree calling though).. My biggest complaint right now is that the POI database (while better) is still not as good as my dad's C330. TomTom has a free download for "retail stores," which include Best Buy, Circuit City, etc, etc, which helps out but it's still far from what I've experienced with the Garmin. This is fixable however, hopefully TomTom will address this with the next map update. I also find it odd that TomTom decided not to copy off of Garmin in this department with the inclusion of the phone number when you select a POI to navigate to, it's a feature I'd like to have. There are lots of custom POI lists out there (Starbucks, etc...) that are very easy to add to the unit, which aids in this department, I'd just like to see more included right out of the box ready to go.. What made my decision was at the price these are currently going for, you simply cannot beat the feature set. The slim form-factor and user interface are really quite easy to get used to, even after having used the Garmin "you have two options" system. If you are concerned about having THE most accurate maps out there, this isn't your GPS at the moment, but it may well reach that level in the near future with a map update.. Again, I have been very pleased with my purchase, it's not perfect, but not a single unit out there is!. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use and accurate. 
Cons:. Can't get route summary unless you navigate. 
Summary:. I intentionally didn't follow the directions on this unit and it quickly recalculated a route. On known routes, the unit generated ones very close to the routes I would have given.. On the highways the GPS directs you to stay right or left which was annoying. Turning the volume down or off remedied this.. The mount stays attached to the windshield (there has only been one incident when it did not but the heat from the Florida summer probably had much to do with it) but at times in the Florida summer heat, the ball of the arm would not hold its position in the socket and would move with each bump.. I wish the TomTome One GPS would allow you to manually start and end navigation for those times when I don't use the car like when I ride my bike or walk. You can get a route summary, but it has to be input first. Average speed would have been nice on the route summary.. Using The TomTom One GPS is so easy and convenient and so far has prevented me from getting lost even when I took a wrong turn. I couldn't put a price or value on the frustration it has saved me. I highly recommend this unit especially since the prices have gone down..

Cons:. No text to voice. 
Summary:. I recently purchased a TomTom One (from Butterfly Photo, no problems) and I wanted to dispel a number of negative myths about this GPS device. I read reviews, blogs&anything I could find on TomTom versus Garmin. For some reason people think that a GPS device needs to have the ability to show pictures, play music, get traffic reports. Of the three only traffic reports is marginally interesting to me but Im not willing to pay for it when I get traffic updates from my local free news radio. The other two options are too ridiculous to consider. What I want is something that gets me to the place I want to go when I dont know how to or know the area. On my reason trip to Indianapolis, IN and through corn fields NE of Indy, my TomTom One did the job quite well. I did not read the manual before the trip, but simply thought I would see if I could get the device to work for me with some trial and error.. Myth 1: TomTom mount does work. I put a dash of water on the suction cup and affixed it to my windshield just above the dash. It stuck tight. I tried to get it off that night and gave up (just removed the receiver instead). That mount stuck to the windshield through the entire 5 day trip in 80-85 degree, high humidity weather with car sitting in the sun. I pried it off at the airport.. Myth 2: Slow recalc times. Not so I made a lot of deviations and it quickly started telling to turn around. On one cross country hop I deviated from the course. It kept trying to get me back on its original course but eventually gave up. If I was smarter I would have re-input the destination and let it calculate a new route. I later found a menu item for alternative routes. BTW, a co-worker took his older TomTom One last year on a trip to Johnstown PA and we got the same dead on navigation during that trip.. Myth 3: POIs are old. I tried a few in Indy and was able to get to restaurants and other places. I dont care about POIs because I can either ask someone for a place and look it up in a phone book (oh, how archaic) or call and get the number.. Myth 4: Support is rude. I have a small problem updating the satellite file. I emailed them and got back a reply the next day. I havent solved the problem yet (been too busy before and after the trip), but the email traffic was courteous and regular. Im on the West Coast so I have to pick a time to call them during the day. Since the file had no effect on the performance, Ive not worried about getting back to solving the update problem.. I rated the TomTom One 8 out 10. I did take one point off for the lack of text to voice. The display (which is nice and bright) is generally very clear about the direction, and it does give the name in text of the next term on the screen, but it would have been nice to have it speak the street name. I think Ill try to change the display to the 2D version and see if that eliminates any ambiguity. I took another point off for the unsolved update problem since I thought the suggestions should have cleared the problem. All in all I dont see the need to pay twice as much for a Garmin to get features you dont need and the performance that is not any different than my $249.00 TomTom One.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simplicity, easy to operate. 
Cons:. Has a little trouble in the heart of Boston with the tall buildings, POI is a little tough to navigate. 
Summary:. I research on CNET.com and other sites for a nice GPS to go in my car. After a while I settled on this TomTom one. From day one this has been a great purchase. I am new to the city of Boston and this has helped me get around beautifully. Sometimes it doesn't have all the short cuts, but if you need a simple, easy way to get around. This is for you.. This is way better than my co-workers GARMIN.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small unit with large screen, very easy to use. 
Cons:. None that I can find. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS unit. I use it every day for work driving around the Portland, OR area.. I would rate this unit higher, but since it is my first, I don't have anything to compare it to. It works beautifully. The screen is very easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The mounting bracket (included) works great. The sound is awesome. I can hear the directions even if I'm listening to louder music or talk radio.. Even though this unit is considered an "entry level" model, it does everything I need it to do. If you're looking for a small, affordable GPS device that will get you right where you want to go, look no further than the TomTom One.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate, Simple, Inexpensive. 
Cons:. Menu shows features not available in US. 
Summary:. We bought this GPS for our personal vehicle because we are very directionally challenged.. We found the touch screen menu to be intuitive and easy to use and the unit did a great job right out of the box.. Some of the advanced features like real time traffic info that are displayed on the menus do not function in the U.S. But for the non-commercial user, it is a bargain for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Customizable; Portability; Excellent Value; Quick Satellite Read and Adjustment, Maps and POI fairly accurate. 
Cons:. Doesn't always plot the most direct route, Battery Life could be better, Traffic and Weather feature only work with select phones. 
Summary:. After a great deal of research into similar models at a comparable price (Garmin SP330, etc.), I decided to go with the TomTom One. I must say that I have been nothing but pleased with the purchase. I found the TT1 extremely intuitive to use, and using the Tomtom Home application makes updating, backing up and customizing my TT1 very easy. Within an hour of opening the box, I had already downloaded and installed additional Points of Interest (Dunkin Donuts, Retail Stores such as Best Buy and Walmart), Voices (the celebrity voices make driving directions fun) and Map Colors (there are a variety of uniquely colored map schemes available)  I found all of these customizable features to make an already solid unit even better and tailored to my specific tastes. In terms of actual use, I find the TT1 to be pretty spot on with mapping and navigation  about 99% of the time. Occasionally it will plot a less direct route than I would have personally taken, but the great thing is I can just ignore it and it will adjust the route (in seconds) based on which direction I turned. I love the feature where you can simply tell it to avoid part of the route and it will recalculate (i.e. dont take me on the highway). Granted, many say the POIs are outdated which they may be, but will a POI database ever be truly up-to-date with all of the changing restaurants, stores etc.? I think this criticism of the TT1 may be a bit harsh given all that you get for under $300  I find the major attractions (parks, beaches) and critical POIs (gas stations, police/fire dept.) are all there. As a basic GPS unit, it does the job. I had a How did I live without this moment last weekend, where I was driving through a remote part of CT and where I would have likely second guessed directions and gotten lost before, I was able to push forward with confidence knowing I had my TT1. I am extremely pleased with the features, ease of use and value I am getting out of this unit and would recommend to anyone looking for a solid GPS unit. I would also recommend, in terms of accessories, a carrying case and a more flexible mounting unit (you can find ones online that allow you to either mount to windshield, dashboard or vent and are easier to place the unit in). As Tomtom is a growing company in the US, I can only expect the POIs, Maps and Customizable Features to get better in the future.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Screen, Easy Navigation. 
Cons:. Calculated driving time is excessive. 
Summary:. I had used a Garmin offered with Avis rental cars many times and was not overly impressed. I decided to purchase a unit to travel with instead of paying Avis to use theirs. After looking at different units I chose the TT One about a month ago. The unit has performed great, has found every location I was trying to locate including hotels, resturants, and airports. The unit locked up once after I had it connected to my laptop, reset it and haven't had it happen again. The only complaint I have is the calculated driving time and estimated arrival time for a trip. The unit must assume I drive 20 mph BELOW the posted speed limit, and it doesn't accuratly update the estimated arrival time to match the actual driving speed. I will be 5 minutes from home and it will still say I'm 15 minutes away. TT support says it can't help with this as it is the way the system works. I disabled the display of dirving time and arrival time and just use the remaining miles to estimate the time I will arrive. Other than this one issue I am very pleased with the unit and would recomend it to others.. 

$$;
Pros:. No-glare screen, ease of use, accurate, clear speaker, customizable. 
Cons:. Included windshield mount very stubborn, unit sometimes locks up.. 
Summary:. This GPS is great for someone who wants to enter into the world of GPS. I've had GPS systems in the past, but they've usually been hand-helds with no built-in maps. This one has very detailed maps of the US, Canada and Guam and has a very sleek form factor.. The time it takes to find satellites is almost non-existent. It'll lock on to a signal in 30 seconds or less, in most cases! This thing also has a dynamite screen. It's bright, crisp and colorful. The touch capability of the screen can sometimes be a little fussy, however, but that's probably because of my big fingers. Just use your fingernails or a stylus if it ever becomes a problem.. Accuracy is also awesome, and the customizable navigation voices that are available are really cool for those who want something out of the ordinary. I downloaded John Cleese's voice and found it very funny.. There haven't been too many problems I've had with this GPS, except a few minor things. First, the included windshield mount is very strong. You may that's a good thing, but just wait until you try to take your TomTom out of it! It's takes a lot of effort to get it out, and you'll probably end up having it pop out and fly across the car if you're not careful. Also, on two occasions, the TomTom has frozen up on the boot screen. I have no explanation as to why this happens, but it's easily fixed by pushing the reset button with a paper clip or thin pencil.. Overall. The TomTom one is an incredible GPS for GPS noobs or experts. It's fun, small, accurate, and, in most cases, reliable..

Pros:. se conecta rapidamente al satelite, encuentra otra ruta facilmente,. 
Cons:. tiene muy pocos favoritos!!. 
Summary:. tengo mas de 2 meses usando TOMTOM ONE y el tama�o me parece perfecto, la estructura con la que la pongo en mi carro esta perfecta, antes tenia un Magellan pero la estructura era como un resorte y se movia para todos lados era dificil ver para donde irme y escribir tambien porke el karro estaba en movimiendo y el gps tambien.. en fin el tomtom one me parece perfecto HASTA que quise grabar las direcciones de mis distribuidores en el GPS para mi es mas facil grabarlas y despues buscarlas y dirigirme directamente,, y estube grabando algunas hasta que la makina no me dejo,, solo se pueden grabar 48 FAVORITOS!! y si quieres grabar mas es imposible solo los puedes poner como punto de interes y es un poco complicado usar el sistema que trae este gps,,, en fin ando buscando otro y ojala encontrara uno exactamente como el tomtom pero que trajera unos 200 o 300 favoritos o algo ahi para grabar mas direcciones personales.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to Use, Itinerary planning from pc to unit, blue tooth enabled for free traffic. 
Cons:. No text to speech; only turn by turn. 
Summary:. I think this TomTom ONE is a great unit for the price. Gets you where you want to go with extras that the GARMIN C330 does not have. Price point: A steal!. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive interface &#38; menus, sensitive receiver. 
Cons:. Factory mount (suction cup) works poorly. 
Summary:. I like the device and it seems to map things out OK but will never replace experience and local knowledge of traffic patterns and short-cuts. It refuses to replicate or approximate my 30 mi. "surface street only" commute though...says my office is unreachable if we don't take the freeways. (Living in So Cal isn't all it's cracked up to be...the traffic is absolutely oppressive.). The unit seems to have quite a sensitive satellite receiver and it even works insde my house. I would like it even better if it would stay attached to my windshield. Falls off about every 15 minutes. No issues with not knowing how to use suction cup devices. TomTom has acknowledged that some mounts are flawed and is rushing out a new one, it's supposed to be here in 3 - 4 weeks (!?!) per their support team. I'm very impressed by their sense of urgency in resolving my issue. They're probably shipping the replacement tied to a stray cat.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to Use, Good Text-To-Speech Quality, BlueTooth Capability. 
Cons:. PC Software Quality, Lack of Support for Sprint Phones. 
Summary:. The TomTom One is a great GPS for someone that just needs an inexpensive GPS that's easy to learn and use without having to memorize the manual.. It lacks a few of the more minor features of the more expensive GPS units, and most of the PLUS services (traffic, Point-Of-Intrests, etc.) only work in Great Britan (where TomToms were originally made), and the uplink to BlueTooth phones for updates and for the subscriptions has limited model/network support. Also, the PC software leaves more than a little bit to be desired (poor UI, severe uplink/connection problems, bad overall coding).. All in all, the unit itsself is great, but a lot of the "extras" could use a lot of work.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, appearance,. 
Cons:. TomTom Home. 
Summary:. The One has now a lowered price at $299 so I bought it. I have never had a GPS so it is the first one. Out of the box, I turned it on inserted the SD card and was on the way. The screens are very intuitive. There is some minor set up to do with registration, etc.. When I installed TomTom Home it installed fine but that is where it ended. I couldn't really tell if I was connected to the PC even though everything indicated it was. Nothing happened. I downloaded my free voice but never really figured out how to get it to the TT One. I called TT support and talked to a real person. Problem is she said there were some problems on the web site and it was being updated. I should see the improvements the next day. Well this is the next week and I still can't download the voice or see my unit connected. Also she was quick to get me off the phone. Oh well, the unit works great.. Took my first long trip with it. About 800 miles. Very accurate with what I saw on the road. POI's are pretty good also. Nice to have the rechargeable battery that either plugs in the car lighter or you can charge it on your PC with the USB cable. Got me to my destination within about 2 minutes of it projection 2 hours prior to that!. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear, readable text; great screen, very easy to use. 
Cons:. Euro-centric for add-ons, support. 
Summary:. This is a great GPS unit. It was very easy to use right out of the box, the charge-up time was quick, and the maps appear to be quite accurate. It took less than a minute to acquire the satellite signal. The voice commands are helpful, but not totally necessary.. Window mounting was fine, and I have not had a problem reaching the controls. I'll probably find a dashboard mount soon, as CA doesn't allow most window mounted devices.. If you are new to GPS, as am I, you should realize that all GPS are good tools, but they don't replace common-sense navigation, especially in familiar surroundings. It's too much to expect that a computer will know the best way to every destination given all the real-life variables that affect our driving experience. If you like a differnet route than what's suggested, just take it. The ONE will re-plan your route to get you where you want to go. It couldn't be simpler.. An excellent unit, nicely priced, easy to use, and a great tool to supplement your common sense.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to setup. 
Cons:. Doesn't recognize all addresses. 
Summary:. I just got the TomTom One as a gift and it's great. The touch screen works really well and the menus are easy to navigate. Creating an itinerary is quick and easy. I also had no problems with the suction cup (make sure the window is clean) and put a little moisture on the suction cup prior to placing on the screen.. I would have liked to see a large SD card (1GB came with the unit). But it is easy to back up the system and then change the maps, so it's easy to work around.. 

$$;
Pros:. Use it out of the box. Directions so far have been very good. 
Cons:. Sometimes takes a long time to power on, even with a fully charged battery. POI's not great.. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS and I am very happy with it. I got it on Wednesday and left for a 1500 mile road trip on Friday and it was a huge help, even around Oakland which is a nightmare to drive in.. I got it for less than $400 on a "popular" auction site, new in the box and ready to go.. I have had a problem getting it to power up on several occasions, even with a full charge and a reset. If the battery is low it won't start till it charges for as long as 2 hours. But I am very happy with it over all, basic, but a solid performer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great UI, SiRF chipset, price, good mount, great voice quality, lots of options, multi-destination routing. 
Cons:. Tele Atlas mapping not as good as NAVTEQ. 
Summary:. Were it not for fact that the ONE uses Tele Atlas maps in North America, I would easily declare the ONE the Editor's Choice. In developing the ONE, TomTom focused on the customer who is only concerned with navigation, and does not want an MP3 player, a picture viewer, or a hands-free speakerphone.

$$;
Pros:. Bright, Clear, Easy Set-Up. 
Cons:. No Computer to Unit Data Entry. 
Summary:. Had the unit now for a week. This is my first purchase of a GPS unit. So far it has made my driving experience much better. I have a large five state territory that has close to 600 different locations; I will be expecting to visit each of them at some time.. It has gotten me where I wanted to go without fail; and twice rerouted me around traffic jams without a problem. This is something I was always nervous about using my old method with a MapPoint paper map. Much safer than flipping pages in traffic.. Only complaint is that I can only enter addresses via the unit. There is no interface yet for entering them via your computer. This will be very time consuming; especially with 600 locations.. 

$$;
Pros:. neater, faster finding satellites than tomtom go. 
Cons:. none really. 
Summary:. I had a tomtom go for a couple of years, really happy with it but internal battery started to lose charge too quickly. Cant' replace myself, tomtom offering to fix for �175 euros?? are they for real? bought tomtom one as replacement, even more pleased with new unit than old. Hope battery isn't knackered after a couple of years though, is this normal?. 

$$;
Pros:. speaker is clear and loud, even in my Wrangler.. Build quality is good.. Interface is well designed.. 
Cons:. my Samsung Omnia is not a compatable bluetooth phone, and their seems to not be any update or any way to get it to work which is lame.. 

$$;
Pros:. Really great navigation, compact, no problems mounting, easy to update. 
Cons:. It takes way too long to power on and doesn't hold a charge well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Address Entry For Final Location Works well, Rotary Knob on suction makes Mounting and Un-Mounting Easy, Good Battery Life, Unit and Mount are small. 
Cons:. Mount is Short, which can make mounting the unit low on the Windshield difficult.. 
Summary:. My unit came with a right angle mounting cord which works well and helps to keep the cord out of the way. The directions are clear and the route picks seem to work well. The unit picks up alternate route pretty quickly when you deviate from the programed route. A nice unit for a first GPS.. 

$$;
Pros:. No frills, simple to setup and use, changes on the fly as needed.. 
Cons:. Does not automatically adjust for night viewing; map zooming is temporary.. 
Summary:. I got my One on sale at Wally World while 300 miles from home on vacation. I sat in my car and configured it in less than 5 minutes. I then planned a route home - the preferred would take me through heavily congested holiday traffic on freeways, so I asked for an alternate route. It gave me a perfectly acceptable alternate. I used it througout the return trip and noticed that it constantly updates the anticipated arrival time depending on how fast or slow you're driving. It gave clear visual and audio alerts to upcoming turns and is perfect for someone who doesn't want to play around with a 'gadget', but needs a dependable routing guide.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and there is no need to put it on the windshield when I'm driving.. 
Cons:. Had to get help to set up bluetooth. 
Summary:. I like it. I'm just sorry I waited so long. to get one. 

$$;
Pros:. Great form factor and great software. 
Cons:. The Maps Stink!. 
Summary:. I did alot of research before buying this for my wife (and myself) for Christmas. Also considered the Garmin 330 and 550. The 330 didn't have the New Sbdir (spelling) chipset that is supposedly a must for new GPS (allows unit to maintain signal in deep valleys or cities with skyscrapers), and the 550 was alot more money $600-700.. I loved the TomTom ONe's size and operation. The online software (TomTomHome)is great and the ability to do planning "offline" is great too.. The maps however really STUNK. Tried it out on a trip to Manhattan and TomTom took 2-3 LONG ways instead of the normal directions (which Mapquest/Navteq maps used). Once in NYC the unit got really confused (lost signal) and tried to get me to turn around 2-3 times. Finally had to shut the thing off after swearing at it.. The only bad thing on the unit is the MAPS. It would be the best (low cost) unit out there if it only used the Navteq maps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use out of box, no frills, CR best buy. 
Cons:. Slow to switch on, battery life, POI database, sometimes confusing directions. 
Summary:. I bought the Tom Tom one when it went on sale in Best Buy. I was thinking of buying one for sometime now since I am someone that is 'navigationally challenged' but the $199 price in Bestbuy was a great one and so bought it. I tried it out a few. times in San Antonio and then when I went for a week long vacation in Boston, Maine and New hampshire, I relied exclusively. on this (though I had AAA maps just in case) and found out a lot about this device. Here are the pros and cons.. Pros:. 1. Very easy to use right out of the box.. 2.Good voice directions even if street names arent included.. 3. Usually picks up 5-7 satellites so good coverage.. 4. Consumer Reports Best Buy and it is s great device for its price.. 5. It is a no frills, easy to use device.. 6. The auto adjusting navigation feature is very cool. I tried folling it several times but it still autimatically calculated a new route.. 7. It lets you avoid toll roads if you choose that option. But beware of this option since you might be taken on some scenic route instead.. Cons:. 1. When you switch it on, it takes close to 4-5 minutes to start picking up signals. So if you are in a new city, you have to wait 4-5 minutes after you started the device up before you can drive.. 2. It retains power for only an hour to hour and half without connecting to the car's power supply. So you have to switch it off whenever you get off the car and turn it back on when you are ready to drive.. 3. When you enter subways, the signal gets lost and it gives you weird directions.. 4. The itinerary feature is confusing. Maybe I didnt understand it right but it kinda screwed up my entire itinerary in Boston.. 5. The Points of Interest (POI) database really sucks. It wouldnt identify the Aquarium in Boston or the Alamo in San. Antonio! Good luck with finding good restaurants. It simply is a major weakness!. 6. If you selected a POI, it will tell you in the middle of nowhere that you have reached your destination and you are left. wondering where the heck the POI you were looking for really is. For example, we were trying to find a restaurant in Maine and it took us to a gas station and announced that we have reached the destination. We decided to drive a little bit down that road and after half a mile, we did find that restaurant.. 7. It is confusing when it says 'Bear right' or 'Turn Right'. I feel it uses them interchangably sometimes.. 8. It doesnt tell you a turn is ahead until you are kind of very close to the turn. Again, this is sporadic and not all the time.. 9. I tried putting an SD card into the device but it would mess the GPS up.. 10. The bluetooth option didnt really work for me even though I tried it several times.. 11. Sometimes, when you switch the GPS on, it still thinks that you are at a previous destination and it takes a few minutes to realie that you are at a different destination.. 12. Sometimes, it takes you on the fastest route and not necessarily the easiest route. When we drove into Danvers, MA, it. took us thru the city streets even though our hotel was right next to a highway.. 13. One time during the vacation, it asked us to exit the highway and immediately asked us to get on the highway!. 14. At one point on route 5A in Cape Cod, it totally didnt know where we were and it was almost funny to see it frantically search for the road in its database!. 15. We wanted to go to lighthouses on the way in Maine and it wouldnt find even one!. 16. It doesnt list road closures.. 17. In a new place, it takes around 10 - 15 minutes to analyze all the nearby roads. So you cannot jump into the car and drive.. Though I list a lot more cons than pros, I think it is a great value for the cost. It is a steal for that price.. Overall, if you want a no frills, easy to use, low cost device, this is a great device. If you are totally navigationally. challenged like me and cannot live with the cons I noted above, you might want to look for a more expensive option.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, loud, clear, prompt. 
Cons:. Complex menus, complex lookup, cannot switch units. 
Summary:. Rented one of these from Avis along with my one-day rental car while in the Netherlands. Was able to program in address in Njiemegen OK, but next day when programming return to Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, I couldn't simply find it under a simple menu option (like "Airports") or use the airport code. Moreover, when I entered "Schiphol", it gave me several options, but the listings were cut off so I couldn't tell one from another (i.e., arrivals, vs. departures vs. rental return, etc. ).. Also for some strange reason it was set for miles. I tried for 20 minutes to find an option to switch to kilometers, so I could relate directly with the road signs, but to no avail. Yes this is a big deal to me because I also frequently travel to Canada.. I'll probably buy it, but I won't like it very much for those few things.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have used it many times in the 2 months I have owned it. It has proven itself useful many times. Best feature is the quick reroute response time if you miss a turn it will reroute you if possible.. 
Cons:. Has every road so if it's on the map you may be routed onto a gravel or even a dirt road. many rural areas have old roads that are still on the maps even if new ones have been built.. 
Summary:. I really like it for my first GPS unit. Being that I can't compare it very well but it works for me.. I just wish it had a stay on main road feature. I went to a Golf course in the middle of no where and it got me there but it did put me on 2 gravel roads and a dirt lane. When the golf course was actually only about a half mile off of the main HWY and on a paved road. some times the fastest way is not always best.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love everything about the design and software of this unit. It's compact, light, very easy to understand, vibrant and clear screen.. 
Cons:. - US Navigation maps are outdated/incorrect. The routes suggested are often not the best way to get to the destination.. 
Summary:. When I looked into purchasing a GPS system for my car, the Tomtom One seemed to fit all my requirements. I loved the physical design, the way the software was laid out, the options for selecting different routes, waypoints, saving destinations, etc.. However, now that I own the unit (for 3 days now), I have yet to take a trip where it hasn't had a problem with the navigation nor route.. My home sits in a long established neighborhood (over 20 years) in a suburb of a major city. Tomtom does not have two major roads in it's map database - it tells me I'm driving through a field... When I drive down my street it thinks I'm on an adjacent street a 150 yards away (now imagine having your home location not being your actual home!); in fact tomtom's map seems to be "shifted" about 150 yards off on half my neighborhood.. Now I could forgive tomtom if that was the only navigation problem. When I set my course for work, Tomtom gives me literally the 5th best route as the 'fastest route'. My workplace is off a major road just off an outer belt and major highway. Surely Tomtom would send me on a similar route that I've been driving for 4-5 years... No, actually it took me well out of my way, adding about 3 miles to the trip, on a route that has more roads, more lights, more traffic, and is on average about 10 minutes longer than the way I've been taking for years. The way I go takes 13 minutes, tomtom's fastest route reports 21 minutes.. I had a similar experience with my brother-in-law's house. Without delving into specifics, tomtom's route made little sense and was about 5-10 minutes longer than the obvious and most efficient route.. I will likely be returning tomtom for a garmin. Which is unfortunate, because I do love how that tomtom is designed. The menu system is so well designed and easy to use I am a little reluctant to make that decision, but what good is a GPS unit if it doesn't serve it's purpose efficiently and accurately?. 

$$;
Pros:. Adequate for navigating and is compact in size.. 
Cons:. Power cord plugs in the bottom making top-of-dash usage nearly impossible. Included windshield mount is much too short for convenient reach.. 
Summary:. A cute and functional unit has been marred by poor mounting design. A bottom-of-the-unit power cord makes it nearly impossible to mount on top of your dashboard since the cord must portrude at least a couple of inches and then bend out of the way. To top it off, the windshield mount extends only two inches, putting the unit so far forward on the windshield that it's out of reach for all except, perhaps, a chimpanzee.. Currently no accessories are listed on the TomTom web site that could solve these problems and the power cord location is not capable of being remedied anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, bright screen, nice user friendly interface.. 
Cons:. Battery life, onscreen keyboard is for the hands of a troll, maps need to be updated.. 
Summary:. I purchased this TomTom about 2 years ago at CompUSA for $99, + tax of course and unpacked it as soon as I got in the parking lot. I found the layout to be very nice and colorful. I'm a visual person, so that was the first thing that got my attention. It was an extreme pain to have such a useless keyboard as the input device. I find it easier typing on my iPod touch, and that's saying a lot. The TomTom gives you plenty of preselected options to choose from as far as destinations such as restaurants, gas stations, hospitals, points of interest, and recent destinations. If you are on a screen where you have to enter an address, the only part that is a pain is inputting the actually letters. The QWERTY keyboard needed to be improved on this unit. Entering the house number is simple as the number keys are much bigger. I have used this unit around town here in Fort Lauderdale, FL as well as on a business trip when I drove from Pittsburgh to NYC. As far as my drives around town, there have been several occasions where the TomTom has sent me on a wild goose chase, and the most recent time was when I had to meet someone at the ER in the local hospital. I was not pleased as the TomTom said I had reached my destination and I was actually at a boat crossing. I was probably a good mile from where the hospital was but this was an emergency and the TomTom did not come through for me. While in Pennsylvania, I fared even worse as we drove through rural areas to get to New York. There are virtually no satellites for miles on end. The other factor that really annoyed me is that this small little unit burned through battery power like you wouldn't believe. I am a stickler for turning down brightness on all my devices to conserve power but it didn't make any difference with the TomTom. I barely get 90 minutes of usage before having to plug it in the charger. The worse part is that the battery dies even when the unit is turned off! I have charged the unit and left it in my car for when it is necessary and days later when I am ready to use it, I discover that the battery is dead. This is unacceptable. Needless to say after 2 years of hell, and a horrible trip to Miami where the TomTom lead me into some undesirable neighborhoods, I will be selling this on eBay sooner than you can say Priority Shipping. I'm looking into Sony GPS systems instead. Sony has yet to disappoint me and I doubt it could be any worse than this nightmare.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great GPS with easy interfacing.. 
Cons:. When something goes wrong, dealing with TomTom UK is a complete nightmare. The web-based contact system continually fails. They need to make it easier to report and address problems - my device is less than 1 year old and the memory needs replacing!. 
Summary:. I would pick another brand for my next GPS based on poor customer service.. 

$$;
Pros:. inexpensive but practical. 
Cons:. cannot delete individual recent inputs. 
Summary:. car charger did not work during first time use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price is right. 
Cons:. Documentation is sparse; lack of off-screen controls for loudness and brightness handicaps single occupant operation.. 
Summary:. My initial impression was that he device was difficult to learn. Now that the learning curve has been surmounted, after a 22 day road trip into the west and northwest, I can say that the unit performed well, got us to all our destinations without mishap (except for the times we chose to disbelieve its instructions, and was a great assist in finding our lodgings and points of interest. My "navigator" praises its utility, and her greatly lessened dependence on paper maps. I enjoy the second by second visual updates of route changes as they approach.. I recognize two shortfalls of the TomTom One: when road/traffic noise conditions change, adjusting the loudness of the device requires six screen touches, including a slider adjustment; when daylight turns to night, adjusting the brightness requires three screen touches. Either of these requires eyes off the road. External nob adjustment is much safer for single occupant operation.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface. Clear voice comands.. 
Cons:. Only gets you to general area. 
Summary:. The main problem that i have with this system is that first it doesn't tell you which side of the street your supose to be looking for your destination and second it will often only bring you to the general area of your destination and leaves you wandering around looking for the place. The maps have even taken me to the middle of no where miles away from the place i was shooting for.. In short its nice and simple just not meant for those I would consider lazy drivers who just want to get somewhere quick without the hastle of looking around for your destination.. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive user interface, ease of use, cool info display (speed, heading, ETA, smooth moving map), power by USB, price for features. 
Cons:. TeleAtlas maps for Canada, Unit activation no good if you want to sell it, windshield holder. 
Summary:. This review is intended to my canadian fellows. Hope it helps. I've bought the TomTom One unit from an online store in July 2007. I've read reviews about that unit before buying it and they were usually great. The only thing that I failed to notice was the use of TeleAtlas maps by TomTom for North America/Canada (more on that later).. At first, the unit worked like a charm. Looks nice, feels nice, software (TomTom Home) seems nice and well put together. I have to admit that the TomTom user interface is very intuitive and the learning curve is short for this kind of gadgets, in my opinion. I also had the pleasure to experience the customization of the GPS display while driving. Like many other units, it can display information but in a well organized way compared to others: your speed (km/h or mph) your heading, your estimated time of arrival, a (smooth) moving map (3D/2D), street names, etc... I believe TomTom's got one of the best looking/functional user interface on the market compared to other leading brands (Garmin, Magellan, Navman). Also, the unit is powered by USB. That means that when you connect the unit to your computer via the provided USB cable, you don't need to have it fully charged before using it (like the Magellan RoadMate 2200T for example). Just plug it, turn it on and use it. Speaker volume is adequate for the task, provided you're not in a farm tractor trying to find your way in the middle of your field in Sask.. On the bad side now:. I soon realized that the good reviews about this unit were made by people in US. As usual, our friends get a better map coverage and better POIs (Point-of-interest) and that's too bad for us (but understandable, halas). After playing with the GPS, I couldn't find my own address (which had existed for the past 10 years)- nice, neither could I find my mom's 20years old neighborhood - sweet. Most of the POIs don't exist anymore or had moved somewhere else a long time ago, not very practical - ok that's it for me.. I found the windshield holder to be kind of hard to deal with. The suction cup was so "sucked" on the windshield that I had to use some kind of tool to get it off leaving the windshield full of finger prints, a place rather hard to clean in my case. Plus the GPS was hard to put on and remove of its holder (too tight fit).. In summary, the (really outdated) TeleAtlas maps on the TomTom One was my main disappointment. Go for a NAVTEQ based unit for a better accuracy in Canada like a Garmin C330 or a Magellan RoadMate 2200T (in the same price range) even if those units lack in features compared to the TomTom One, you'll be glad to see that your address exists, at least!. Note: I didn't use the "Traffic" feature on the GPS since we don't have that service in Canada yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, software options. 
Cons:. POIs (really!,) software needs to be tweaked. 
Summary:. I thought POIs, eh...then I used it in a new place - the InfoUSA data is horrible and the taxinomy is not clean. While in Ft Lauderdale, I looked up Sheraton and I got one listing, for a "Sheraton" but the wrong hotel...after some grumbling, I looked up the name of the hotel "Crypress Creek," and saw Cypress Creek Sheraton. egad...and the software...it is pretty good, but you cannot see the complete name listing...address, and/or phone number for a POI - each time I selected something (and if it is wrong - usually 50% of the time, ) I have to start all over. Great unit - but a pain in the ***. Ugh - hald the time, it cannot acquire a signal.... 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate mapping, good screen, clear audio.. 
Cons:. Will not find stores. Hard to figure why they made it like they did.. 
Summary:. The main problem I have is that I cannot find stores. Shopping centers, yes, but not individual stores. Other problems are POIs, points of interest. They have large icons on the first screen, then they have a drop-down list that you have to scroll through alphabetically. It's just hard to get around, not enough features that I need to quickly choose my waypoint. My Garmin 320 is quick, you find where you want to go, and just GO! 30 seconds and I'm off on the trip. The Tom Tom can't find any store anywhere! There are dozens of other places I can find, ice skating rinks, ATMs, you name it, but Wal-Mart, Dollar General? Nope. Perhaps my machine is broken or something, but I've not been able to get a clear answer from anyone about it. Tomorrow I'm heading back to the store to turn it in. It's a shame, I got it for a steal, too, 150.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use and price. 
Cons:. Poor POI database. 
Summary:. I recently bought the TomTom One based on several great reviews from friends of mine who own the GPS. While at first it does seem great, as I used it I became less and less happy with it. My main problem was the POI database. While it has plenty of restaurants you can not lookup a grocery store, or many types of retail stores. TomTom has added a POI database of Target, Wal Mart, Circuit CIty, Best Buy, and a few other stores but if you are looking for a specific store near you, you are out of luck because the TomTom cant find it. There is an option for looking up shopping centers, but this is completely worthless as most shopping centers have meaningless names. I am a pilot and wanted to use this on the road when I land at airports to find nearby food and shopping, but I was also disappointed at the lack of airports in the database as well. Three different airports I went to in only a few weeks of owning the GPS were not in the database.. I would highly reccomend this GPS to someone looking to use it to go to specific addresses but if you want to use it as a GPS that can find you anything out on the road I would recomend the Garmin GPS's as they hae the database you will want.. Hopefully TomTom will fix this as it is the only thing holding this GPS back from being great.. 

$$;
Pros:. it sort of works. 
Cons:. terrible maps. 
Summary:. As an electrical contractor I own 7 gps units for all my service vehicles so I have a lot of experience with all the different types of gps's Magellan, Garmin and now tom tom, I'm sorry but the tom tom is the worst as far as maps and usability, we have adresses that are nearly 8 years old that do NOT appear on the maps where they did appear with the Magellan and the garmin units, the search features on the tom tom are also the worst, and its layout is not that user friendly as compared to the garmin and Magellan units, we like the garmin units the best, I cannot afford to purchase a gps unit for 700 dollars that does not have 8 year old addresses in it. I checked that we do have the latest version of the maps and we do. Sorry but the unit goes back to the source store that it was purchased from today and my next stop is at Costco to purchase the Magellan 800 as I have experience with this unit and find to have all the addresses and more concise map data base, I was hoping that the tom tom plus services would make up for the poor maps but the unit had no success in connecting with my cell phone via blue tooth so much for that. The plus features absolutely do not work with me as the process of connecting the cell phone to the unit was just way to cumbersome and required a lot of research&&..Sorry, you need more work on this product,,,,,,,,product number&&&nj5aj eggpf 9zte2. 

$$;
Pros:. TomTom GUI interface and quick recalcs. 
Cons:. Out of date maps and poor mounting bracket. 
Summary:. I've had my TomTom One for about three weeks now and I must say I've enjoyed it quite a bit. In the breaking in phase I've used it almost everytime I get in the car but haven't taken it on any long trips just yet.. Installation of the included software is easy, but the included documentation mentions a free map upgrade and free one year TomTom Plus service. Once installing the app I didn't see how to get the free map upgrade, though the promotional code I had was good for the free plus services and a free voice. A complete map upgrade for the One NA version is 119.00, pricey.. Since the device is relatively new I'm holding off on the map upgrade issue, hoping that the one it has is up to date. One off putting thing about the map data is that the maps for my area are sorely out of date. Roads that have been missing for years, created in the past 3 years, or just modified are not in the map database or incorrectly shown. It makes you wonder how many years out of date that the maps are.. One other function that might be related to map data is trip times. It seems that my regular commute in the morning is incorrectly stated as taking 40 minutes to complete. Each day I start out from home with the One telling me I'm going to be 8 minutes late for work. It maintains that I'm going to be that late until I get on the highway where in a span of 9 miles it tells me I'm now going to be 2 minutes early. I've done the math and can only assume the database shows the speed limit for that highway as being 35 mph, because my vehicle doesn't go fast enough to make up that much time based on the posted speed limit. Friends with TomTom tell me it's better at estimating longer distances, and that's likely true.. The last issue I have with the unit is the windshield mount. You'd think for 500.00 that a decent mount would have come with it. The mount that it comes with is forever falling off the windscreen, even when it's been moistened (Something I tried just yesterday). It's entirely too short making you have to mount it on the far left of the windscreen or up around the rearview mirror to just be able to reach it and given it's proclivity to fall the left hand mount is my only option. Of course TomTom offers a better mount for 50 bucks.. It would also be nice if you could add POI's to the existing categories, rather than having to create your own.. Overall I'd have to say that the One navigation system has everything I need to get me where I'm going without having to rely on maps while I'm driving. It's not going to emliminate maps though since it might break one day when it falls.. Updated. on Dec 4, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, no frills, usually gets the job done.. 
Cons:. This sounds funny but sometimes it does not know the easiest, or best route.. 
Summary:. There were times it misdirected me, this was more common then I'd care for. I'd test the unit by programming a route that I know, and then see where it would take me. About 10% of the time it would be a round about way. Now the unit can't see any satellites. Attempted a number of software fixes, but nothing worked. I don't beat things up, it lives an easy life in a glove box. Now I'm stuck with a gps unit that can't see satellites. Time for a Garmin, or Megellin.. 

$$;
Pros:. less components, less nuisense route planning in comparison with other brand. auto-upgrading priority places in ordering. options on night driving background setting.. 
Cons:. all similar names of city throughout australia are listed. not like other brand, you can assign which state you are in. Unable to find street name if you don't know exact suburb name and input municipal city name instead like Naveman did.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, easy to use. 
Cons:. Small font of status bar, very long wait to acquire satellite signal, horrible at locating addresses, horrible at route-finding. 
Summary:. I can not recommend this product. Received as a college graduation gift and had a chance to thoroughly test this unit on many road trips. It always found routes that were much longer than those suggested by Google Maps or my friend's Garmin. Additionally, the addresses were a block or more off target. The price point of this product makes it very attractive, but I suggest spending more money on another brand.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice concept. 
Cons:. Tom Tom wouldn't even turn on - low battery. 
Summary:. The Tom Tom was given as a gift and nowhere in the instructions did it tell you how to charge the soon-out-of-juice battery! Or how to erase previous trip?. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of neat features. Very functional interface. Great Potential. 
Cons:. Fatally flawed mapping software. 
Summary:. This review is for the One 3rd edition model. I really wanted to like the TomTom. It's very nice looking and the interface is very friendly. There are all sorts of interesting screens that show how many satellites you're receiving and every bit of data I wanted to know about my spped, direction, time to destination, etc. The Home software allows downloads of map corrections and updates from other users. TomTom even throws in a free upgrade to the latest map when you purchase it. Unfortunately, none of this makes up for the terrible software.. I'm not sure if it's the maps or the routing algorithm but this unit managed to screw up even the most basic trip. I programmed it to drive home from Circuit City. It's only 3 miles from my house. Instead of taking a right out of the parking lot, the TomTom sends me across the street to the ring road around the mall across the street. Then it makes the right turn and takes me the correct way. OK, so this is just a minor glitch. So I programmed it to find the body shop I'm taking my car to for a repair. I enter the address and I'm off. The TomTom announces I'm at my destination and the body shop is no place in sight. So I pull over and call them. I'm 3 miles from their location. I went home and entered the address into Google maps and Mapquest and both found the address easily. I tried a Garmin Nuvi 200 at CC and it had no problem either.. Well, I tried a few more addresses and the Garmin did a much better job at finding the addresses and charting a more sensible route. I ended up swapping the TomTom for the Nuvi 200. The TomTom has a lot more features but the flawed mapping of the TomTom made the Garmin Nuvi 200 an easy choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice looking devices. 
Cons:. horrible customer service. 
Summary:. I have been a TomTom GPS user for several years, starting with Navigator 4 on my Palm Tungsten E2. However, I cannot recommend their products to anyone. Their maps (which come from TeleAtlas, when everyone else in the GPS world relies on NAVTEQ) are horribly outdated and inaccurate. In the past month, I've tried navigating to 5 different addresses that are all at least 10 years old. TomTom was able to get me close to 2 out of the 5. When I recently tried to update the maps on my device, I was told that in order to get new map data, I had to upgrade to Navigator 6. That's fine -- and I was reluctantly willing to pay $150 to get decent maps -- except TomTom discontinued support for all Palm devices except the Treo phones in Nav6. So, after spending $350 for their software and bluetooth GPS receiver, they've left me stranded with 4 year old maps and no support. I contacted their customer service department looking for some type of solution. Can I get a map update that works with Navigator 5? NO. Can I "trade in" my unsupported hardware and get a price break on a new device? NO. Is there ANYTHING that TomTom is willing to do to keep me as a customer? NO.. Bottom line -- I bought Magellan Maestro 3100, just released in April 2007 -- on sale at BestBuy for $199. It does everything I need -- great signal acquisition (I was finding 8 satellites from INDOORS!), great maps (found ALL of the addresses that befuddled my TomTom), great interface, and quick routing.. JimJim says bye-bye to TomTom for good!. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful interface. Fast processor, Bright screen.. 
Cons:. Map library is sub-par at best. Need to pay for updates.. 
Summary:. I bought this unit as a present and decided to check it for dead pixels etc. before Christmas. When the unit can find a particular address, it works wonderfully. It has the most intuitive design I've seen so far. Unfortunately, it couldn't find my brother's street. I decided to navigate my way back to my apartment. No luck. It could identify my street easily enough, but it was missing the first 6500 street numbers. I tried a handful of other places in various states and found a recurring theme. The unit simply doesn't have a large enough map library.. It appears that TomTom had to simply cut arbitrary addresses from the database to fit everything on the card. For $500, you'd think they could provide a larger card / map library. The included software lets the user update the maps for a ridiculous fee. After paying $500 for a unit, I think you should start off with up-to-date maps. After getting junk to start off with, how much faith do you have that the expensive updates will actually bring the unit up to speed?. 

$$;
Pros:. WAS great for about 2 years then.... 
Cons:. update crashed the unit.. 
Summary:. Planned update to crash Tom Tom Ones? After updating a regular basis thes past two years or so, mylatest update crashed the unit. Tom Tom said "sorry". This is not that old so my guess is their "update" is designed to crash some units. Nice work. I'll spend myu money on another manufacturer. Who does Tom Tom think they're kidding. Check it out folks!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and intuitive. 
Cons:. Doesn't support automatic on/off. 
Summary:. If it weren't for one major ommission the TT One would be excellent. However, it does not support the ability to automatically turn on/off when external power is . You ALWAYS have to manually turn it on/off and, making matters worse, you have to hold the power button down for 3 seconds in order to do so. For those of us with switched 12V power outlets the ability for the ignition to turn the unit on/off is GREATLY desired. Magellan and Garmin support this and I can't imagine why TomTom does not.. 

$$;
Pros:. easily mounted. 
Cons:. almost everything else. 
Summary:. This thing has gotten me lost so many times I cannot count. It tells me the road I live on is unpaved(which it is not)and I can't seem to change that fact. Everytime I am going home and need to use this thing I have to let it know I'll travel on unpaved roads. It's hard to zoom out to see where you need to be going if it is sending you in circles and on a longer route than you need to going. I am so disappointed in this thing. Spend a couple of extra dollars to get a nav system with a bigger screen and better maps.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast recalculation of route. 
Cons:. It breaks down every other day!!!!. 
Summary:. I think this is a very cheap product from the true sense of the word. It breaks down so often that it is totaly unreliabel. You may be out traveling somewhere and before you knwo it, it is dead and you have no clue where you are. Also, the custoemr service is terrible, you ask them for a new product to replace the broken one after the second time they break, and they refused. I have never had such unreliable product ever berfore. I can not believe they are still in the market. I think there is a majore defect because the failure mode of both unites has been virtualyl the same!! Which indicates that they have had issues and they do not know how to fix them. Please DO NOT FALL in the trap I did and do yourself a favore and go buy GARMIN. I bought GARMIN and since then I have been MUCH happier and much more comfortable with it than TOMTOM.. 

$$;
Pros:. A lot of features for the price---programmable screen. 
Cons:. Two defective units, inaccurate speedometer and maps, customer service sucks, won't stay on window. 
Summary:. Bought two units---both defective. Went directly to white screens after powering up. Reset was a temp. fix. After two hours with tech support, 1 1/2 hours reformatting and reprogramming I was to there was no fix. I was told to pack it up and send to the company for another unit---I demanded an upgraded units for wasting a week of my time and money. I was told no way!!---and was told to spend more time and money going to the post office to make a third exchange for the same unit.. Will not stay on window---one customer service rep said to twist it. Another said there is no fix. I believe the second.. I can't stand these TOMTOM people....would never buy again.. I now own a garmin and LOVE it!!! Perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks good, feels good, easy to use. 
Cons:. Doesnt get you to where you want to go. 
Summary:. Looks good, feels good, nice interface and display, totally updatable database, BUT IT GETS YOU LOST. Seriously lost. This unit doesnt use same mapping system as Garmin and Magellan, and it is totally unreliable. Right off the bat, my own street was mislocated. While this was easily updated through their mapshare system, the mapping in my town is so bad, that it would take me months to correct. I wanted to give the unit a whirl by inputting an address of my kid's friend, that I didnt know how to get to, but my wife did. We got into the car, and my wife kept telling me "dont go that way, it's a dead end". I insisted, and I ran into a dead end. Again and again. At least we had a good laugh, and for that, it is excellent! The unit kept recalculating and sending me into more dead ends, one after the other, and the trip, that should have taken 15 minutes, took 30. We finally got to our destination, based upon my wife's directions. I got the unit for my wife, and based upon that experience, she's gunshy about using it, based upon it's lack of dependability.. 

$$;
Pros:. great voices. 
Cons:. wrong directions. 
Summary:. The main reason for purchasing a GPS system is to give correct directions, this one does not. Many times it would tell me to go down an alley or make a turn on a dead end street. Numerous times it had me exit a freeway just to get right back on. I used this for a week and ended up returning it, just not worth the $250 I spent.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use?. 
Cons:. Out of date maps and bad customer service. 
Summary:. The TomTom One is cheap and you get what you pay for. Overall it is an ok navigation system if it is all you can afford. Eventually you will wish you had spent a little more to by a better product. The TomTom Home software that updates the unit is a joke you would think kids developed it. To give you an idea of how bad it is they have yet to figure out how to list the prices in dollars. The customer service representatives are cold and arrogant they act like Americans are beneath them. They need to figure out they only work for a non-US company they still live here. Bottom line is spend more money get something that you will use for a long time and with better customer service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use. 
Cons:. Has no idea of where to take you. 
Summary:. In the rural setting in Texas this stinks! It is near worthless. It took me to the edge of a lake and said the dam was a road that I could drive over. I had it take me to Starbucks, which from my home tis four right turns and about 16 miles. TomTom one had me turn when two miles from my destination taking me around town and arriving at starbucks from the opposite direction. Consumer Reports should be ashamed making this unit a best buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fairly easy to use. 
Cons:. "Preloaded Maps" are at least 5 years old. 
Summary:. The purpose of a GPS system like this is to guide you from point A to point B. This does not work very well without an up to date map. The TomTom One is preloaded with an outdated map and TomTom will only update it if I pay for it. I would be more than willing to pay for future updates but it seems to me the initial map should be the latest.. 

$$;
Pros:. The battery life is deceint.. 
Cons:. Screen is not bright enough, no text to speach, poor mounting, poor POI database, no external volume control dial.. 
Summary:. I travel every week and have used about 7 different nav systems. The lowrance Iway 500c is by far the best even though its the size of a tank. I will start with what I did like since there was only one, it was compact and the battery lasted a while before it needed a charge.. The list of the things I did not like about the TomTom One is much longer.. The display is hard to see in the daytime even with the brightness turned up to 100%. When you get close to your turn, it tells you the distance to go in yards instead of feet. There is no external volume control on the unit. You need to adjust the volume through the settings on the LCD display. This is annoying especially if you need to turn it up and down frequently for phone calls.. The suction cup that comes with the mount did not hold the unit to the windshield, it came off so frequently that I stuck the unit in the cup holder. A bottom-of-the-unit power cord makes it nearly impossible to mount on top of your dashboard since the cord must protrude at least a couple of inches and then bend out of the way. To top it off, the windshield mount extends only two inches, putting the unit so far forward on the windshield that it's out of reach.. The zoom in function will not allow you to zoom in and remain in, it zooms out automatically. The POI database is weak. The TomTom Ones ability to get you to the POI was about within a block. If you could not see the POI from the point the device told you where it was supposed to be, you were screwed. As an example: It told me I was at a movie theatre while I was in the middle of a highway. I had to stop and ask for directions. I needed to get off the highway at the next exit and turn into a huge shopping mall. The movie theatre was tucked in the back of the shopping mall right next to the highway. However it took another � mile of driving to actually arrive there.. You could not search for points that were on your existing route. I had to cancel my old route and then perform a search. It does not have text 2 speech capability. This means it tells you when to turn but not the name of the street or the hwy number.. I returned it after 4 days of use and would not recommend it for a person who travels all the time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. I get lost using it 2 out of 3 times. 
Summary:. I have owned the Tomtom One for about 9 months and I keep giving it one more chance to prove itself. Yet it continues to let me down. This past weekend in Pittsburgh, it couldn't find my hotel (a Marriott), couldn't find a church where I was going to attend a wedding and when I plugged in the local golf course, it brought me to a truck stop instead. This is not an isolated incident and I've now given up defending it to my friends and coworkers who have a great time making fun of it. Tomtom refuses to acknowledge this is a defective unit. I'm really disappointed with the unit and their service and recommend readers consider any other make besides Tomtom.. 

$$;
Pros:. Don't know - it never worked.. 
Cons:. It never worked.. 
Summary:. I purchased a refurbished TomTom One on-line from FutureShop.ca. According to the enclosed literature it was refurbed by TomTom. It never worked - it never got past a screen that says "please wait" in several languages. According to TomTom tech support the unit was shipped with the wrong map version AND it is defective. Tech support walked me through the re-set procedure and clearing the flash memory. Neither of these solutions worked. Future Shop wil take it back at a local store and provide a full refund. I'll buy a brand new one at the store and will post a new review when I've had a chance to use the new one. TomTom Tech support was very helpful, but they have limited hours. Their tech support web site was very limited. I did find the re-set and clear flash procedures on their web site, but only via links from other GPS forums, so I was reluctants to try the procedures without calling TomTom first.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have bandaids. 
Cons:. What is wrong with cardboard?. 
Summary:. I cut my hand prying and slicing open the ridiculous bubble packaging on the TT One. The thing cost $300 bucks and I felt like I was stealing it. The reward is when the TTom unit flies out of the plastic and (lucky for me and TTom that it didn't) smacks onto the ground. I hate the thing and I haven't even turned it on yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. small size. 
Cons:. no text-to-speech, very short battery life. 
Summary:. Easy to use right out of the box, but was very erratic. With no "text-to-speech" all you get is instructions WHEN to turn, but not the street names. Paid $299, additional $25 for home charger and $30 for a case. Returned it, bought the Garmin Nuvi 350 for $398 - came with home charger, case and battery life of 4 to 8 hours. No comparison - very accurate, can just put it on seat and listen to your instructions - calls out EVERY street name, highway ramps, etc. Pay a little more - get a LOT more.. 

$$;
Pros:. larger 4 " screen. 
Cons:. Tomtom is reluctant to stand by there products. 
Summary:. The newer version of us/canada maps was very poor with the software showing that I was driving beside the highway that I was on and in cities in Alberta, it had my location 1/2 block out from where I actually was, causing the gps to get confused and often telling me to turn around before I reached the actual street I was supposed to be on. Terrible mapping, terrible service from tomtom.. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use. 
Cons:. Appalling customer service. 
Summary:. crashed on a regular basis and stopped working after I downloaded the first software update. Customer service is non-existent and truly appaling when reachable. Should not have distributed to the US without adequate support. Online help site is laughable by US standards. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use the device.. 
Cons:. Updating the device requires unintuitive, unstable software; poor documentation; hard to reach support.. 
Summary:. Running into problems using the updater software (HOME) is easy. The Mac version of the software seems to be unstable, which has meant (for me) having the software shut down in mid-update on several occasions. Restoring from backup, whiling seemingly easy, can often result in incomplete restores. Starting over is not an available option. Finding solutions to problems on TOMTOM'S web site is difficult and getting through to telephone support is impossible. So if you use TomTom ONE right out of the box, you'll be all right. Using the software updater, however, is risky business.. 

$$;
Pros:. user friendly and detailed map. 
Cons:. some road/highway names are confusing. 
Summary:. I bought Tom Tom almost 2 months ago. It didn't give any problems until last week whilst driving the screen was all jumpy from the map screen to menu choices. I had to pull off on shoulder and re-set the unit and still it behaved pretty much same. The voice guidance worked and with that it was enough help to reach my destination. And now - a week later the LCD does not respond to the commands. I called tech-support and the person was not keen to help much by excusing himself since it was end of the day and advised me to call back another time so that senior tech can try to resolve. Apart from that the Windshield mount was not designed for use in US.TomTom one drops when the heat is on. Very disappointed by the quality of the product.. 

$$;
Pros:. small/fairly cheap. 
Cons:. lacks functionality of other units priced the same. 
Summary:. had it for 3 days...taking it back...does not satisfy a long trip where you need more info...distance/miles traveled/distance to rest areas..(rolling distance) speed/avg speed/elapsed time/can't scale out and hold it/cumbersome to use when trying to drive...too many "backs" and "dones"...plus there is no user manual to help explain anything..the documentation in the box is useless...and the support desk is double useless.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small and Bright. 
Cons:. Volume not accessible, default menus annoying, missing streets. 
Summary:. I have a Garmin 330, screen could be brighter but it still works great, simple and intuitive, love the detour feature. Later models address the glare, etc. We use it all the time, my wife can use it (i.e., easy user interface).. The TomTom One, is not nearly as intuitive, the default screens are a mess where you have to keep telling it things like toll roads, etc. Perhaps there is a way to set it different, but I am not bothering.. We have already found that the newly purchased unit does not have streets on it that my 330 has. But the killer in all this is there is no external volume control. Just like an MP3 player, you need one, depending on conditions. I just took mine back after 2 weeks.. Completely possible that the TomTom one has lots under the hood that make it great, but the default, simple stuff they turned into a complicated cluster.. 

$$;
Pros:. None! Caused more grief then helped!. 
Cons:. Never turned on without a fight, sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't, and the warranty is not real. There's always a reason why the product is not covered under warranty.. 
Summary:. My hundred and some dollar product is now garbage. I can't even pay for a repair (company doesn't do that). 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing, nothing, nothing.. 
Cons:. I had to have the first unit replaced twice and it never did work. The third time they sent me a new one and it is now sitting dead on my desk. It wont turn on or charge.. 
Summary:. Customer service recommended that I buy an upgrade. And I advised that I wont ever buy another tom-tom product. They were no help and told me that I had no recourse in getting the unit fixed because I had no receipt. I told them they sent this unit to me. They said I needed the orgional receipt for the first unit. They are nothing but crooks in my book and I plan to let everyone know how I feel. I am also reporting them to the FTC&gt; Hard earned money gone. Bast----.. Updated. on May 13, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. there really was nothing. 
Cons:. Never really worked right, so I let it collect dust on the shelf. 2 yrs later I called TomTom support to try and get it working &#38; after their 'help' now I have a completely non-functioning device. Thanks a lot. 
Summary:. Device never quite worked, then completely failed within about 2 yrs. TomTom support=the nail in the coffin for my device. Now I have a $300 paperweight.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great navigation for a semi low price. 
Cons:. Well if the unit breaks after 2 years you have to go buy a new one the company will not back there product in anyway after 2 years. 
Summary:. I bought the tomtom go 910 alittle over two years ago the connection between the gps and the charger came loose and stopped taking a charge. I called the company thinking the could help only to find that the really didn't care . Thinking this was wrong in someway i called again and asked to speak to a supervisor and again was told in different words that company doesn't care and you should buy a new one cause the 2 year old unit i have is outdated .So i bought a Garmin. 

$$;
Pros:. Got it on sale at Christmas for Cheap. 
Cons:. What is good about this one? Inaccuracy. Very minimal Points Of Interest. Extra charges for everything. No map updates. Very cumbersome &#38; difficult to make personal corrections.. 
Summary:. This thing has gotten us lost way too many times. Isn't it suppose to help with direction? On a major trip to Florida, using the "Fastest Route" option it took us through the backwoods region of Alabama &#38; Mississippi with lots of light signals, turns and small towns. What should have been an 11 hour trip turned into 14 hours. A new road had been created in the past year, along a route it chose, and it kept scrambling to find a new direction for 20 miles!!. TomTom boasts a certified Map correction online database from users that you can download, but everytime we've tried it, it seriously messes up any direction the unit provides. It tells you roads are closed when they are not, it will request you make U-turns on major highways, it will ask you to do circles in intersections (Seriously!!, I'm not kidding). I'm sure users who are submitting are playing jokes on others but we checked the option to have corrections only certified as correct by TomTom. They need to do their homework.. You can not rely on this thing at all. You have to have a map or google map printout to confirm your destination.. When putting in an address destination or alternate route it will on occasion provide multiple listings of the same street with the different zip codes behind it. Who knows off hand the zip codes of a town you're only visiting for the day? You have to guess which one is the right one and *hope* you picked correctly or it will wisk you 20 miles off in the wrong direction. It has happened to us.. Buy a different brand!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. * Small. * Durable (trust me, this thing will anger you and you will toss it around). * Clear voice. 
Cons:. * Inaccurate directions (this should never happen). * Inefficient directions (it makes some major, very time consuming mistakes). * Buggy: Inaccurately warns of unpaved roads, erases favorites after updating map. * Wish I mad more space.... 
Summary:. I despise my TomTom One.. I find it amazing how much hate I can have for such a little item. Here are the reasons I just want to blow this thing into a million pieces:. (*) The "Avoid Roadblock" option is buggy. I used it tonight and it "detoured" me by having me drive in a big loop that ended at the same point I was at when I told it to detour me. As I was driving thought it felt like a pointless loop and it was!. (*) It will go out of its way to create inefficient routes. On this route I needed to travel on a road parallel to the one I was driving on. It had me needlessly pass a perpendicular street and travel to another perpendicular street further away for no reason. Since I didn't know where I was going I didn't realize it was planning such a stupid trip until it was too late to save the time.. (*) I live near Orlando. Whenever I want to travel to the central-east / southeast coast of Florida it sends me up an interstate running northeast to Daytona Beach then south on I-95 to my destination. There's a pair of highways running directly east that this device stubbornly refuses to use and when I do it cuts a huge amount of time and distance from the path TomTom chose. I know TomTom is buggy in this way so I ignore its directions when I'm leaving the house, but when I'm coming back from some destination I'm not entirely familiar with I would like to know I'm heading back the right way. I have to wrestle with the thing for about 5 minutes until I can force it to change its path to one that makes sense.. (*) This thing usually harasses me with a nag screen telling me that the path involves unpaved roads. Unpaved roads? Why does it always tell me unpaved roads when there is no paper jam...er.... unpaved road? (Sorry, I channeled "Office Space" there for a second) And yes, there was a time when my path really did have an unpaved road and it didn't warn me.. (*) After you enter your destination you will never see it again. Say you're heading to 1575 Main Street, after about 15 minutes on the road you might forget that house number. Keep it around on a piece of paper because the TomTom WILL NOT allow you to see the address once you're heading to it. How stupid is that?. (*) The GPS module is junk. After turning it on it will sometimes take 4 minutes for the device to figure out where it is. (It has a timer displaying this duration so 4 minutes is not an exaggeration) You'll learn to leave it on so that it doesn't lose its position but.... (*) ...the battery is pathetic and will drain way too fast and shut off anyway.. (*) If you update your map the favorites you have entered will be erased. This was confirmed as a bug on one of those times I got to speak with tech support.. (*) The mount device is awful. Awful. It rarely snaps on right and you'll settle for it being on "good enough". Then you touch the screen and it pops off and slides around your dashboard.. On the plus side the device is small, the screen is easy to see, the voice clear, and the screen easy enough to navigate with.. And, yes, I am actively looking into buying a new one from a better company.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and very versatile!. 
Cons:. Customer service is horrible and the unit is basicall throw away after warranty. There is no factory supported repair process.. 
Summary:. Cannot recommend until customer service improves.. 

$$;
Pros:. i am new to this device, and after purchasing it, it seemed to be an impressive unit that is untill i tryed to upgrade it.. 
Cons:. POOR customer support. falty software with no "easy" fix. preloaded map is way out of date.. 
Summary:. i received the tomtom one as a xmas gift, and after inspecting it, it seemed very impressive, was i ever wrong! i checked out their site and it was suggested that the unit be updated, so in doing so through the automatic updates 3/4 of the way through the "garenteed latest maps" the unit showed and error and thats where it stayed. a total of 16 hours on the phone with tech support trying to "fix" their software, with a quarter of that time on "hold"! i went through all of their online fixes for their software problems and still coulndn't get it fixed. i wasted two solid days online with trying to fix their software problems to noavail. i was supprised to see that there were alot of reviews with software issues of similar nature. and after doing some extensive reading on the tt1, the bottom line was if you want a gps with all the frills and bells and whistles with questionable operability the tt1 is for you. but, if you want a gps of better quality that has a better reputation for not letting you down go with a garmin, which is what i ended up going with. been using it for a while now with not as much as a hiccup. i just wish i could have known about tt1's falty software issues before i bought it. i could have spent that time with my family. talk about learning the hard way. good luck to all.. Updated. on Dec 26, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works, it gets you out of many jams..... 
Cons:. They can't seem to send me a working unit.. 
Summary:. My wife and I decided on the TomTom One based on a recommendation from friends. They had just purchased one and used in it Italy. We were going to Italy a month later. The TomTom one worked wonderfully on our vacation. When I went to use it a couple of months later, I found that the battery was dead. I charged it fully and then when I attempted to update it, I got error after error. I spent a few HOURS in the phone with customer service. I will definately say the the CS staff have been helpful and kind, but to no avail. They will eventually tell you to send back the unit for an "RMA." Well, I've had to do this 3 times. I recieved my 4th unit just the other day, and wouldn't you know it, RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX WITH CS ON THE PHONE it fried....just the same as the others....It erased and made "unformattable" my SD cards, made my computer go all "Wacky" and require re-boot, and showed mulitple errors. I didn't touch ANYTHING without being walked through it by CS. Now I'm waiting for Corporate to contact me so I can ONCE AGAIN argue my case for them to send me a new, upgraded (i.e. not a "ONE") unit.. They have a habit of not calling back when you are told. So at this point I've had 4 TomTom One's in a little over a year....I've only had a USEABLE TomTom one for a small part of that time..... As I have said....Customer Service Technicians are friendly and helpful...but there is only so much that they can do if you've got a crap unit....One time a Corporate guy said "When there are 1000's of units out there, you're bound to have a few with problems...." but as I said, can ONE GUY GET EVERY LEMON????. Don't Get a One!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. With basic inputed direction, user can be guided to their destination. I like the standard voice option. The 2D View is easier and simple to see.. 
Cons:. It looses it's sense of direction. It sometimes goes berzerk. It may tell you to go down a one way street the wrong way. You can't save your inputted directions you spent a lot of time on.. 
Summary:. This is the letter I am sending to their corporate office. You be the judge! Let's hope the GPS genre improves majorly ASAP!. February 28, 2008. To whom it may concern at TOMTOM,. I like many other Americans received a GPS TomTom 3rd edition. Having gone to an accredited college and majoring in graphic design, I have a lot to say about the overall functionality of the device. I also have experience working for an international housewares company in their product development and marketing department.. It is a relief to have a directional device to use in the car. However, I have many crazy stories and I understand I am not the only one. My doctor says he doesnt really rely on his anymore. Here are my experiences:. 1.	Turn the unit on: The button is recessed, so it is hard for me to stick my finger in the hole and press down. I have to hold the button down for approx. 10 seconds. Annoying. It could be like a digital camera power button  no problem.. 2.	I spend 30 minutes planning my route, trying to make alterations, trying to take alternate routes, trying to take well known streets I know, and: I cant even save the info so I can use it again!!! GONE! So I have to waste my time again and again. My passengers say,  just forget that thing and lets go! I want to have saved routes!. 3.	I want to be able to tell it the way I want to go! Not this, look at the details, make an alternate route, recalculate, start over, blah blah blah. Time wasted! I would like to plan my route maybe on my computer, on the device, then have it recite it to me as I go!. 4.	If I use an alternate route and use the map to do it, it erased all the other streets I wanted to take and takes these crazy ways that no one in their right mind would take!!!. 5.	I want a nice map to look at for my area. I dont want to have to go to yahoo maps, or google or mapquest, print the area map, then go back to the GPS. Blah, blah. I want to zoom in and out on the GPS easily, pick the streets I want to take, write down the streets  so it needs to be able to keep my map zoom level, then program that into the GPS!! Easy. Fast.. 6.	How the heck should I know what town or city the street/cross section I want is in???? IVE never been there before!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In a state there should only be one place where two streets meet. Or even better . . . I should be able to zoom out of the map, pick the ZONE I want to be in, then input my cross streets. Easy, simple. I was trying to go on a trip and it always asks, what city??? They are small FARM towns, how should I know. What if I went on a long road trip??? How should I know???. 7.	This is the REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE. I planned a route. My Dad and I went to a benefit in Chicago at the Science and Industry Museum. Not downtown, on the South Side of Chicago. This is a very mixed area. BiPolar if you wish. Extremely poor, extremely rich and a college is there too. Right off Lake Shore Drive  a major motorway. At the end of the night  LATE, my dad and I were tired. He said, well, let the device take us home. Im tired. Okay, well I let it do its thing, Fastest Way. Never heard of the streets it wanted us to take. Even my Dad agreed. We were like, we are right infront of Lake Shore Drive, where the heck is this thing gonna take us??? So, I asked it to take us to the Shortest Route. Here comes the not so funny funny mayhem:. A disclaimer appears. I was like, what is this?? Disclaimer: sometimes the shortest route is not always the SAFEST ROUTE! Me: Excuse me??? Maybe it is just trying to cover its back and be overly cautious. My dad was like, dont ask me!!! Doesnt sound too good and its late at night and we are not in the best of areas!!! Me being an optimist, I said, well, it looks on the map of the route pretty simple and straight. I did not look at the text. Oh GOD! We started off. Hmm, its not taking us to Lake Shore Drive right infront of us. Hmmm. We are going parallel to it. Dad, turn around and get back to the museum!!!! Naah, maybe there is another entrance to Lake Shore. Dad . . . . . mmmmmm, this doesnt seem right. So, we enjoyed the lakeside view, the awesome Chicago architecture, new and old, Jessie Jackson lives here, Mohammed Alli, Barack Obama, nice and not so nice. Time goes by. Gee, why isnt it taking us to Lake Shore. Turn here curve here, straight ahead. Then . . . . uhhhhhhh. S T O P !!!!! Ohhhh . . . GOD! My dad  ahhhh!!!!! What are you stopping for???? Get us the hell out of here!!!!!!!! Yes, my heart sunk. Major housing project right infront of us!!!!!!!!!! Uhhhhhhhhh.. Visions of gang shootings, car jackings, murder, car theft came rushing to our heads! My dad  GET US OUT OF HERE!!!!!!!!! I didnt want to floor it or keep going into the the bad hood. So I looked about and saw a gas station and turned around!. That was nearly the end of the crazy journey. Then, we get downtown. I tried to get to an expressway I knew. Then the GPS tells us to turn down a one-way street going THE WRONG WAY!! If I didnt have my own plan, I would have turned that way cause it was dark and I dont know that area! My dad was like, Jesus! What the heck is this thing CRAZY??? Its trying to kill us!! Then, it started to get a little ADHD. Turn here, turn here, turn here. Uhhhh! I got to the expressway, then it started saying, turn left, turn right, turn left, turn right over and over again. I had to quote Star Wars  Han Solo referencing an out of control CP3O Shut her up or shut her down!!!!!!!!!!!! My Dad tried to, but as I mentioned it is nearly impossible to find the button cause it is recessed in the device. Where I cant find it, where?? Lets see: dark in a car, on a motorway driving fast with a device rattling off, right, left, right, left! So I stuck my hand out, leaned forward, slid it across the top and waited 10 seconds as the GPS shut off finally!. Now, envision this: I am familiar to some extent with the city of Chicago and so is my Father  he was raised and lived 60 years here. What if I was my sister who has no sense of direction, what part of town is good or bad and no way to find her way back???? She just trusted the faithful GPS??? This has happened before, she would have had to call us for help and come get her!!! She could have been murdered, robbed, hurt, afraid. Hence the disclaimer warning I see.. And you know I saw a guy driving with a cell phone, with a paper in front of him and with a GPS on driving like a turtle 20 under the limit, driving like a drunk!. I would like to go on-line, update maps, save my routes, share routes with my family/friends, get popular routes to places. Maybe even scenic routes to places. Some other girl I know had a Garmin and she said the sales rep told her the military uses its satellite and it is better. She also could scroll through a ton of fast food restaurants. I would like to maybe enter my own places restaurants and hotels and see them on the map. Maybe appear as a nice little icon I can choose. Like I could scroll through a lot of cute colored icons for libraries, bars, shops, etc. Even the map colors are dull. I like the night green and blue  all the time. Easier on the eyes without glare.. When you say, personalize your GPS, Im like oh, yea! I can add a lame voice to my device. I can update my map by a few streets. How thrilling. How boring. It could be so cool if TOMTOM only opened up to it. Maybe it will in time.. Right now, I feel like it is useful for when I already know where I am going. I would not recommend this to an older person like my dad. He wouldnt know how the heck to use it! He wouldnt waste his time. How bout old people that have troubles getting around and they used it! Heaven help us all!!. My mother spent good money on this thing. I would rate it a 2 out of 10. Perhaps this will be insightful for you. Perhaps you will file this in your cabinet. At least I got this frustration off my chest. We shall see how GPS evolves. We will see if you remain at the top of the list TOMTOM.. Respectfully,. The Driver. TOMTOM ONE 3rd Edition. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface - lousy support. 
Cons:. No support for bugs, just buy $oftware/map updates. 
Summary:. I purchase a TomTom for my spouse in September 2007 - Used it three times. When it automaticlly selects a route it said that unpaved roads were part of the route, even though they weren't - contacted support and they informed me that an updated map is available for download for $79 and this will fix my problem - This is the answer to fix my problem - spend more money and hope I don't have another bug or that this will fix the bug I do have.. 

$$;
Pros:. It works sometimes. 
Cons:. Maps outdated in USA, Lack of Manual, Tech Support Poor. 
Summary:. Foreign made- lack of support- had to download manual online-has to be reset often the longer I own it-have to have a fine sharp item to reset going down the highway. After my purchase other friends purchased different GPS and comparing they are not experiencing poor outdated maps! Must be due to foreign creators. After 6months both a friend and I have to reset our TomTom's often &#38; notice now its slow to load. Please do more research before you buy this one! Buy USA!! To update my map it will cost more *sigh*. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. breaks after a few hours. 
Summary:. I bought one of these and loved it. Three days later it simply stopped working. I took it back and got another. That one worked for less than 30 minutes before it stopped working. I contacted TomTom which gave me a run around, didn't solve the problem, and never got back to me after the initial contact. I am on my way to take this one back and get a refund. If you want a pretty paperweight, then buy this, but if you want a working navigation unit, find something else.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to read (when it works). 
Cons:. Missing major cities like Seattle!. 
Summary:. I thought this would be the ideal first GPS for me since I just want the basics, no fancy bells and whistles. And when it would navigate to a small town nearby, it worked fine. But then I tried Spokane (unknown) and Seattle (ditto.) Tech support said, "Yeah we get a lot of complaints about that from your state, so we're thinking about adding those cities to the next update." Incredible!. The tech glitches (wouldn't navigate back to my home, etc) were possibly because it's a refurb. I returned the piece of crap and will replace it with anything but TomTom.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Price is the only pro.. 
Cons:. Not user friendly, to much navigation to get to certain settings!. 
Summary:. I'm not beginner when it comes to GPS. So on that note I think the TOMTOM One is horrible. It seems asthough this GPD was only designed to sell at a cheap price. I key point is that you can not just view the map and your location in its entirety. You are stuck in navigation/destination more where as the NUvi 200 you can click stop and display your current position on steet level without the prompts still going. And the directions suck big because you get redirected to make U-turns and circles around streets when you go off route instead of redirecting you from your current position to the fastest route to stay on time...The Garmin Nuvi does that wonderfully. How about this, when setting up my home as a destinition of return, it was almost 500 ft off.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap. Slim.. 
Cons:. Not a good product. Displays wrong st. names. Not even close to Garmin.. 
Summary:. I had borrowed my brother's Garmin C330 a few weeks ago so I had to get a GPS. I chose the TomTom One because it was on sale. After a week of use, I found out why it was on sale for such a low price! It is horrible! It would call out wrong st. names for the exit and sometimes would stop working. I since exchanged it for a Garmin Nuvi 200 and couldn't have been happier...even though I had to pay the 15% restocking fee for returning this garbage. Don't buy it. Buy a Garmin.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive. 
Cons:. Doesn't work -Support stinks- company doesn't even acknowledge the 3rd edition. 
Summary:. I purchased the TomTom One 3rd edition from the local WalMart. They were still unloading it and putting it on the shelves. The 3rd edition has the software pre-loaded and does not come with the disk. I got it home, programmed about 20 locations and then went to TomTom's website to download the "HOME" software. That was when it went bad. When I first hooked up the USB connection and attempted to download "HOME" I was greeted with an error message that said my software wasn't compatible with that version of "HOME". Nice....then I tried to look up the FAQs on their website in regards to this error and found that the 3rd Edition One wasn't even mentioned there. After the error message, I discovered that I had lost all sound on the TomTom. The sound folder was empty when I browsed to it, but I had files in the Voice folder, but alas, no sound. I sent support an e-mail asking for advice since no software download was available on the website. I got a reply a day later telling me to try reloading the software. HELLO? It doesn't come with any softare. Then I called support and got the world famous tech support advice of the hard reset, which I did and still had no voices. Two days later I received an email saying that since they hadn't heard from me they were considering my problem as SOLVED. Technically, they are right as I returned the defective POS to Walmart and purchased a Magellan. Problem Solved.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy and intuitive interface. 
Cons:. GPS never gets the signal. 
Summary:. Never managed to get GPS signal. Apparently the new software (v. 6.50) problem. Support desk was no help at all - following their advice caused the device to stop working completely. Remember to make a backup before you do anything they say.. 

$$;
Pros:. Interface with the computer. 
Cons:. I was excited about this product since it wasn't expensive and I liked the interface with the computer. Then I went out of town and the thing did not turn on. For the past 3 trips (I travel weekly) it sometimes works sometimes doesn't.. 
Summary:. The reason for my "abysmal" rating is because three times now I was in a strange city and twice I could not find my way to the hotel and once almost missed my flight. The only reason I bought a GPS is for it to help me get around. This TomTom failed in its one and only purpose. The first time this happened I called customer support, and they got it to turn on. The second time it happened, I reset everything to the factory settings and that helped too...for a couple of days. The third time it happened I called support again. They wanted to troubleshoot. Instead, I asked for another model or a refund, since I can't afford to wait for the troubleshooting process. The problem with troubleshooting is that they make a change and I see if it helps. In the meantime, if it doesn't, my safety is at risk if I'm lost in a big, unfamiliar city, or if I'm rushing to find the airport so I can get home to my family. Do not buy this device. It does not always turn on. Unless you're willing to troubleshoot for who knows how long to see if the troubleshooting helps. In the meantime get yourself a Garmin just in case.. 

$$;
Pros:. Poorest serice in the world. 
Cons:. Make you confused all way while driving.. 
Summary:. Never touch TomTom GPS. Updated. on Apr 8, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use, size, volume. 
Cons:. out of date in the box. 
Summary:. Bought it at staples, it has no clue a 4 lane US highway is near me, or that it is even there. Uodated .. still no highway, PAID $50 for update service and NEW maps . still no 4 lane US highway. Called TomTom - no help no refunds. Should have bought a Garmin, well, Ebay is just a click away!!!.

Pros:. Maps are accurate, map share keeps them up to date. Fast recalculating of routes, gives ample lead time for directions. Easy to use. When it works, I like it a lot!. 
Cons:. Occasionally freezes up, sporadically cannot find GPS. Sometimes reset work, some times its a service call. 7 service calls and 2 RMA's in the first year. Help desk is only open until 7:00 eastern, so be prepared to call during work.. 
Summary:. It's a great product when it works, but I can't trust it to work when I need it. Support is helpful, but I need to call them WAY too often.. 

$$;
Pros:. Customizable graphics. 
Cons:. Highly unreliable and TomTom does not stand behind their product.. 
Summary:. I received a Tom Tom One XL S as a Christmas Present. In the one month that I have owned the unit, it has quit working 4 times. Each time I have contacted TomTom and they have asked me to reinstall the app. I'm still having problems and rather than send me a new unit, TomTom told me I am out of luck.. Updated. on Jan 26, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface. 
Cons:. Outdated maps bad customer service.. 
Summary:. The unit came with out dated maps from 2006. I have been trying to buy a new map for over a month now but TomTom is saying they are having problems with their servers. Contacted their customer service and have been getting the run around. FYI the updates US/Canada map will cost you $74..

Pros:. Easy to follow menus. 
Cons:. A REAL pile of junk. 
Summary:. Santa brought me a TOMTOM One Ver 3. Opened in on 12/25 and set it up for the trip to Christmas dinner. Once in the car I turned on the unit and it displayed a "white scree". Pressed the reset button and it worked. One the way home from Christmas dinner the unit again powered up to a white screen. The next day I called TOM TOM and described my problem. They said they have duplicated the problem in their lab but cannot fix it. The offered to send me a new unit once they received mine.. I took it back to Target and got the $. Who needs the POC.. TOMTOM is 1st on the S List!.

Pros:. The 45 minutes it worked it appeared to be a great instrument. 
Cons:. Product is flawed, company does not stand behind it.. 
Summary:. If I could give this product less than one I would. I had a TomTom One for LESS than 45 minutes when it stopped working. I phoned their tech. After several hours on the phone with them THEY ADMITTED many of the systems are flawed and basically the unit I had was fried. They suggested I return it where I purchased it, they do not take their product back directly. I contacted the online store where it was purchased. They said it needed to go back to the manufacturer. I carefully wrapped every piece back into the box along with the manual, etc. &#38; mailed it back to TomTom. Yesterday I received a plain cardboard box that contained a used TomTom unit, 2 USB cables and one holder to stick on the windshield. No manual, no case, just JUNK and I do mean JUNK!!! It doesn't even work! I phoned TomTom this morning, spoke with "Melinda" for almost one hour. She said she was very sorry but I should have phoned them to get a number prior to returning it to the company. THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT BACK NOW SHE SAID I SHOULD HAVE PHONED THEM FIRST BEFORE RETURNING IT??? I asked WHY they did not offer me a return number in the first place? She again apologized, took down my work number and said someone would get back to me today. Guess what? No call. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! This company not only lacks in a quality product but their customer service lacks horribly. Spend it on a product that works or is from a company that stands by their product!.

Pros:. Looks Nice out of the box. 
Cons:. Doesn't Work out of the box. 
Summary:. Just spent an entire day trying to set up the unit. It would not detect a signal and kept re-booting itself. Support rep tells me to send it back as defective for a replacement. Why did they send out a refurb that they obviously did not check? No returns accepted on refurbs...check the fine print before you buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. When the unit did work it was easy to use. 
Cons:. unit is not reliable, customer support is limited in knowledge. 
Summary:. I had purchased one of these for my birthday and it worked for one week before i needed to download the backup file i created with the included software. Then it quit working again, and again, and finally wouldn't accept the software at all. I then mailed in the unit for repair and received a refurbished unit that was not the original one. As soon as i received that one i started to explore the options and it froze, shut down, and restarted. Then it was used for an 800 mile road trip and quit working again after only going 300 miles, this was 1 week after getting the refurbished unit back. Tomtom was and is only willing to do the very least to make a customer whole again after the poor product they make fails. I recomend that NOBODY buys this unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small and light. 
Cons:. Unstable equipment. 
Summary:. This product is very unstable. For the price youd thing they would include the paperclip to get to the reset button. Had it for 2 hours and already hat to do a reset. Do you think that would be safe when you are driving? Nice try. How about making a product the public can really use&. 

$$;
Pros:. None. It would be nice if i could get my money back!. 
Cons:. Junk, right out of the box!. 
Summary:. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this unit. Unusable right out of the box. Used it once, to see how it works straight out of the box. Then wanted to program a route. After a number of calls to tomtom. You find out the software, packed with the unit is not any good. Down load the new software. Retry to program, that software gets you a Big Red X on the screen. It must have erased the internal memory. Another call to tomtom? Unit now is useless.. Unless they do a heck of alot of work to make a better product. I'd stick to a Garmin. Used my Garmin for years, never had anything like this happen. I'll be shopping for a new Garmin today!.
