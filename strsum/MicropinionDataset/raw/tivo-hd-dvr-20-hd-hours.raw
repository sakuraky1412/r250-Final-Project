Pros:. easily upgraded, software updates have eased some lag in menus, more features than cheap cable company DVR for only the cost of ownership. 
Cons:. obviously it needs a cablecard to get encrypted channels and cable company hassles me for not using "their" equipment. Not TiVo's fault.. 

$$;
Pros:. menus are very intuitive. pausing live tv is more useful than i thought. buttons on remote are well organized and makes sense.. 
Cons:. i wish the remote had a flat bottom or a rubber bottom, so it won't roll of my bed or couch.. 
Summary:. i'm happier with this recorder than any i had in the past.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use ,great menus does what its supposed to time shift hdtv programs for us folks with a new hdtv but no cable/sat company dvr. BTW the instant cake hard drive upgrade works great I have 1tb wd hd for 131 hours of hdtv recording.. 
Cons:. wish there was not subscription fee like old school vcrs, but a years tivo subscription still cheaper than any cable/sat services so I can live with it. 
Summary:. This is a great unit for us folks who want hdtv time shifting but dont have cable/sat company dvr. It works well although the firstime setup is a slow drag (btw hook up you tivo though dsl (cable or wireless) because it can take hours with phone lines. And everytime you unplug it the tivo goes though a god awful long start up sequence. Also if your not worried bout getting under the hood look and brain cooleys insider secrets at upgrading your tivo (if you ever built your own pc its a snap) I did and with in a hour I upgraded my tivohd with instant cake and 1tb western digital hd and now have a 131 hours hdtv storage. It does what it says it time shifts hdtv programs if you like me and only have OTA hdtv tivo hd rocks. If you have hd with your sat/cable provider get there dvr , but for my uses this is a great machine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Many great features and It's a TIVO. That says it all. 
Cons:. Needed a bigger hard drive (but that's been fixed). 
Summary:. We were Tivo DirecTV customers for three years. Loved Tivo, but hated the way DirecTV was treating their Tivo customers. We did the only reasonable thing and dumped DirecTV in favor of Cable and the new Tivo HD DVR box. Great picture, great on-screen guide, handy hard drive capacity expandability, and it does everything we want. We don't miss VOD and PPV, as we have all the download features availble to our Tivo box through our high speed DSL connection. The soon to be released (2Q, 2008) SDV addition (through a USB port) will make this Tivo Box even better and more compatible with new cable company upgrades and features. When they new cable and DirecTV DVRs are compared to Tivo, it's not even close, as Tivo wins, hands down. It's like a big college team playing a high school team.. 

$$;
Pros:. Multi Room Viewing, Expandable Storage, Online Media, Online Games, Photo Viewing, Music Streaming. 
Cons:. Not Free :). 
Summary:. Device is excellent.. After you buy the device, get cable cards from your cable company; M-Card or multi stream cards they are also called if available, you need 1 M-Card or 2 S-Cards. They plug in like a PCMCIA card in the side of a laptop. They are a fraction of the cost of set-top boxes or DVR's from the cable company. Current Rates on Cable Card are $1.91 a month(sometimes a bit more in some markets), with the first one being free usually (per outlet) which means if you have 3 cable boxes you could be saving $45 bucks a month depending on what your current charges are. Keep in mind that most cable operators also charge you for the remote control. Check your bill folks. Taxes also apply to that. Under most markets, this device is usually paid for by savings on the cable bill in 8-10 months if you use their DVR. Anything beyond that is pure savings. Not to mention the product is far superior.. Most of the reviews here that are sub-par affecting TiVo's rating are from people that have not owned it or ever used it. They merely gripe for paying what turns out to be 8 bucks a month and change if you prepay for service. That service is for future software update development and your guide data that TiVo will fetch every night. You always have 14 days of guide data on hand. I have gladly paid TiVo to keep my guide up to date, and frankly love every innovation they have developed over the years.. Read any of the low reviews carefully before you think that TiVo has anything to do with it.. One user posted a low review because their home network was slow; nothing to do with this product at all. Another because a cable company installer broke a shelf in her glass entertainment center. Those reviews were harsh on TiVo when the device had nothing to do with it.. Currently I own:. 3 Tivo Series 2. 1 Tivo HD (this model). 1 Tivo Series 3 HD (The expensive one). I have used TiVo for years, expansive guide; ability to search for things you do like, and TiVo can record those types of things you want automatically.. Software that is being deployed now, also includes a nice new feature, advanced wishlists. Say for example you wanted to find Jennifer Aniston films not related to the show "Friends" You just tell Tivo, Jennifer Aniston -Friends and there you go, TiVo just got smarter.. The Multi Room Viewing and TivoToGo features are being rolled out to the boxes and will be enabled in November. The cable companies have fought and lost that battle. Some of the reviews also give TiVo a low rating for those features not being available until now; again--nothing to do with TiVo, it was the cable companies that didn't want the feature there; and they lost.. I'm writing this review to set some of the information straight and encourage other current TiVo owners to do the same.. Buy a TiVo, get your cable cards and stop paying the Cable Company all the extra money, Remote Fees, DVR &#38; Set-top box rental, DVR usage in some cases, plus taxes etc.. 

$$;
Pros:. Runs circles around other cable boxes!. 
Cons:. Owner needs to install unit - cable company won't. 
Summary:. Purchased TiVo HD from weaknees.com with a hard disk upgrade to 33 hours HD. Have used TiVo since series 1. We subscribe to WAVE Broadband Cable Service and they provided a Motorola HD DVR which I did not like at all. WAVE replaced the unit twice and it still was not fully functional. When I learned TiVo was offering TiVo HD I was elated. What an improvement over the Motorola unit and past TiVos. WAVE provided a M2 cable card at no charge. Who needs Video On Demand. With TiVo Swivel search one can find plenty of programing to watch for free. It even searches Amazon's TiVo movie library from which one can download movies for free. Most important the my wife loves the simple functionality of the remote control and on screen menus. I feel sorry for COMCAST cable customers who have to put up with the cumbersome remote and horrible menus. Try Tivo. I bought TiVo's their 3 year service, 8 plus dollars per month. My cable bill including the service is five dollars less.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Nice User Interface. - Netflix Streaming. - HD quality. - Multistream Cablecard Capable &lt;-- decreases monthly rental charge from cable co.. - Record shows from the web. - Can pull shows off the Tivo HD and store or reencode for other devices (ipod, etc). 
Cons:. - Stock HD is too small for HD content. - Difficult to type in search boxes using onscreen keyboard. I hope Tivo adopts a texting approach using the numpad on the remote in future versions of the software.. 
Summary:. I was actually satisfied with my Motorola Explorer 8300HD from Time Warner Cable in NYC. After moving to SoCal, TWC out here gave me a Moxi. Worst, bug-ridden POS ever. I did the math and figured out that given the amount of money we spent renting our 8300HD for 3 years, We would actually spend less by purchasing a Tivo HD (refurb) + lifetime subscription over the equivalent 3 years time. So we made the switch and calm, peace and enjoyment has returned to our living room.. We've never missed a show due to scheduling changes (happened on the Moxi). Recording live events results in a prompt asking if you want to pad the end of the recording as many live events run over... simple but great attention to detail. Netflix streaming over our cable modem resulted in fantastic HD resolution streams.. Like I said earlier, I liked the 8300HD but it didn't have one of my favorite features of the Tivo HD, and that's the ability to pull shows off the Tivo and store it on your computer, or in our case, our NAS. So we can archive the entirety of Planet Earth in HD for future viewing without taking up precious space on the Tivo. This also allows us to reencode and take our shows/movies with us on laptops or ipods/iphone.. Being networked, the Tivo HD also has access to YouTube, Amazon Unbox, and streaming music. The music choices on Live360 needs some update and it's impossible to find a stream that's &gt;128kbps so we end up not using it too much. Instead we just play music from our music library on our home network.. We love our Tivo, and now understand why those that have one, swear by them. I don't know how better to explain other than the Tivo is DVR done right, and with regular updates over the network, it just keeps getting better. All I want now is Pandora, then I'd be a real happy camper!. 

$$;
Pros:. best in class user interface; expandable;amazing customer support; youtube on your TV; two HD tuners; Amazon UnBox video rentals; Internet radio; podcasts; home movies; new features added all the time. 
Cons:. box + service + cable card rental can be pricey; returns for defective hardware are annoying; HDMI glitches; doesn't work with sat.; no onDemand support. 
Summary:. TiVo has been making great DVRs for quite some time, and the TiVoHD just makes it better. The UI is clean, easy to understand, responsive, and has a great remote. While other DVRs are starting to catch up (See FiOS's DVR for an example) TiVo keeps pushing the bar higher.. But what many people don't understand is that the TiVoHD isn't just a DVR -- it's also an Internet media center. You can listen to any Internet radio station, watch Youtube videos, play multiplayer games, rent videos from Amazon, etc. all from the same unit. And TiVo keeps pushing out updates to the software which add new functionality. (The Youtube videos just arrived this month.). So what's so cool?. The channel listings are great. You can easily see the next 10 shows coming up on a channel and the shows on the next 10 channels.. Searching for TYPES of programs (Sports, Action Movies, Talk Shows, etc.) is simple and quick.. TiVo recommendations are fun and often great.. You can add more hard drive space just by plugging in a compatible (eSATA) external hard drive.. Customer support is easy to reach, knowledgeable, and friendly.. Amazon Unbox rentals (12,000+) are convenient, easy, and usually cheaper than PPV.. I love being able to listen to Internet radio through my stereo. (My house blocks most local radio stations, so it's the only radio I can get.). You can also transfer shows from your TiVo to your computer and back again for additional storage and backup.. The downsides?. Well, the box can be pricey. $250 for the unit, and TiVo charges a service fee. Then your cable company will likely rent you the cable cards to make it work for an additional fee.. Also, returns are hard and annoying. You effectively buy a second unit before shipping the old one back. Once they get the old one they will refund your second purchase price.. There also seems to be a bug with HDMI video timing when switching resolution on certain televisions. This hits me. The work around is to lock the video resolution, which is annoying.. And, of course, the TiVoHD doesn't work with satellite television. (Sat. TV uses a different technology to descramble the picture and receive channel listings.). You will lose onDemand from your Cable Provider. While not a problem for me, (I rarely used it) others can make due with Amazon Unbox, Youtube, and podcasts.. 

$$;
Pros:. Full featured, versatile, and easy to use. 
Cons:. Built-in program storage is too small, officially supported storage expansion options too limited. 
Summary:. Pay no attention to the negative reviews from ignorant folk who've never used one of these boxes.. I was a happy TiVo series 2 owner for over a year before this unit came out and it was definitely worth the wait. HD recording plus the smart, versatile, easy to use Tivo interface are alone worth the price. My 79-year-old mother, who couldn't program a VCR for a million dollars, uses this TiVo like a pro. We have the unit connected to antenna only and the picture quality generally exceeds the quality our neighbors get with cable DVRs. Being able to record two programs at once from any combination of sources (Dual ATSC or dual NTSC tuners or dual cable cards if installed) is another plus. The icing on the cake is the ability to play photos and music from my computer, as well as movies on demand from Amazon Unbox, on the living room TV by simply pressing a few buttons on the remote.. All that said, there are a few caveats. Room for only 20 hours of HD recording is insufficient, especially with multiple viewers in the house. Without an inconvenient work-around, the unit's ESATA port only works with the TiVo approved and marketed 500 GB "My DVR Upgrade" drives.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, intuitive, reliable. 
Cons:. Subscription cost, dealing with cable company. 
Summary:. As the owner of two Series 2 TiVOs, you could say that I'm a believer. In my pre-HDTV days, and no-pay channels, these worked great via analog cable signal. However, when it came time to upgrade from 27" tube TVs, research was necessary.. I have Verizon's FiOS service. Overall, even with standard set top boxes (going through the Series 2 TiVO), the picture clarity is much higher than I had with Comcast, both digital and analog signals. This baseline is what I'm evaluating the TiVO HD versus the FiOS Motorola HD set top box and DVR (which a number of my friends have, with similar plasma screens).. The TiVO itself is a piece of cake to set up. The interface is just as easy (my mother, who struggles how to get solitaire to open in Windows, uses TiVO effortlessly). The picture quality is top notch. The features are great - storing shows on a desktop computer (if you have something you want to keep for eternity or burn to a DVD for your own personal collection), streaming music, downloading video blogs, scheduling the TiVO to record something remotely (I use this ALL the time), etc.. The issue lies with the dreaded cable cards. The cards themselves are not the problem - the cable providers cannot (do not) get a reliable supply of functioning cards - but more importantly, their techs have not the slightest clue how to make them work. I had one card that would only pull the analog signal - four techs came out trying to fix it - wasting hours of my time and the cable company's time. Ultimately, after going through many layers of technical support on the phone with Verizon, the problem was that the home office didn't "turn the card on with the right signal". It was possibly one of the most frustrating and annoying processes to go though. This is no fault of TiVO - solely Verizon in this case - but read up on the TiVO community forum how to install the cable cards. I wish I had - would have saved me hours upon hours.. The other negative is the additional cost - however, once you account for the lesser cost of the cable cards, the difference is minimal (buy a year at a time subscription and save money). Overall, TiVO HD is completely worth it over the cable company's mediocre DVR offerings.. 

$$;
Pros:. TiVo interface; easy to set up and use; great HD functionality. 
Cons:. Lack of cable box option; CableCards can be a pain. 
Summary:. Having been a long-time TiVo user and fan, I was afraid of having to spend $600+ to make the move to HD. Fortunately, this unit came along and made the move significantly less expensive.. Using this unit isn't terribly different from previous non-HD TiVos. The most significant difference is the switch from an interface with a cable box for the inclusion of Cable Cards.. Getting the cable cards set up took a bit longer than necessary, only because the Comcast tech didn't know what he was doing. But once they were installed, the unit was good to go.. I do miss Comcasts' on-demand services, especially the option to watch HBO shows and movies without charge (as I'm currently an HBO subscriber). But the sacrifice is worth it for the TiVo interface and ease of use.. Comcast is touting their own Tivo-interfaced cable box, but I have read online that it is incredibly buggy and sluggish. For the time being, I'm quite happy with my TiVo HD.. 

$$;
Pros:. Multi-turner, so multiple shows to watch, record, play/pause at the same time, great quality.. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. Cable Card allows multiple channels not only to record and watch but you can also play/pause and flip back and forth between live tv, it's great! Last night I watched the national championship game, got to speed through commercials and down time since I could pause it when i caught up to live tv, flip to one of my shows on CBS/ABC, watch that show until a commerical and flip back. Was so amazing to skip past all the boring stuff.. You can't access on demand or pay-per-view but you can still get a cable box and plug it in to a different input on your TV if you really want that, which gives you even another channel of flipping.. I have only had this product for 1 1/2 weeks now, but I was at home sick for much of that time, and I love it, got to really enjoy it. Think I will buy one for my bedroom now too.. 

$$;
Pros:. One remote, one box, one set of cables... clean and easy. 
Cons:. None, if you like Tivo. 
Summary:. It's to bad I had to rummage through the ignorant Tivo hater reviews of people who didn't have or even try the product to find real reviews.. I did, and I'm glad.. The Tivo was installed by my cable company in about 30 minutes, card and all. It was linked to my wireless router and updated in another 15 mins. The Tivo remote was linked to my TV as well as my receiver in no time at all (literally, 1 min for each)... it incredibly easy, although I must admit, my wife is a wiz with the Tivo.. Now I don't have to bypass the Tivo to get an HD show off the cable box because there is no cable box. One set of cables from my Tivo to my receiver. One set from my receiver to my TV. One remote for everything.. They even transferred my product lifetime subscription from my original Tivo to the HD box.. 

$$;
Pros:. HD recordings, new software has all old features. 
Cons:. hard disk space is small, monthly service fee. 
Summary:. It took TiVo some time to make it happen, but with their latest software updates, Tivo 2 Go functionality is back, along with all the functionality I used in my last TiVo.. The TiVo HD was a must for me, since I couldn't give up watching my shows when I wanted to get HD. TiVo's normal fast forwarding through commercials and time shifting are great. and HD content with 2 tuners works out even better.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cable-card accessible, Beautiful HD. 
Cons:. No "List" button. 
Summary:. I've been using 2 original Sony Series 1 TiVo units for over 5 years. I decided to buy this HD unit when TiVo offered a transfer of the "lifetime service" from older TiVo units for $199. The unit was very easy to set-up, and the cable company (Cox) was able to add 2 cable cards with Premium and HD service in less than 30 minutes. This is what I like about the unit:. 1. Awesome dual tuners in HD. It is the only way to watch sports and movies. My cable company finally has a decent selection of HD channels, and I'm having a great time pausing, rewinding and watching football and basketball games in slow-motion.. 2. The government requires cable companies to provide cable cards, but they don't have to offer multi-streaming, so no on-demand or interactive. My cards cost $1.99/month.. 3. TiVo list uses folders which is a great way to quickly search for your saved shows.. 4.1-button delete (with a folder for recently deleted shows in case you accidentally delete one you want).. 5. Exandable storage now available via port on back of machine. 6. Program your unit remotely via any computer. You can also download movies, shows and music from sites which charge for the service (I don't have this yet, but I considering trying the movie service).. 7. Network your home computer via ethernet or wireless (I use wireless). You can view photos and videos via TiVo's easy to use onscreen menus. Right now, they only guarantee that their TiVo wireless unit will work, but it is very easy to set-up. I got mine much cheaper off the internet than from TiVo.. 8. Transfer shows to other TiVos and your computer (I really like this feature. It failed the first 2 times I tranferred to the computer, and then it worked fine after that).. 9. Good ergonomic remote with buttons in all the right places, especially if you like to fast-forward through the commercials.. Now, what don't I like?. 1. No "List" button any more which means you have to press the "TiVo" button twice for your list of shows. This isn't a big deal, but it means that you'll see TiVo messages more often.. 2. I've noticed that there is a very slight pause when changing the speed of HD playback from fast-forward to play, while the standard TV format remains completely seemless.. That's it. As you can see, I love TiVo. I've been using it for over 5-years now. It's a great way to watch all the shows you want and none of the advertisements (unless you want to).. 

$$;
Pros:. Powerful &#38; intuitive interface, ability to save recorded shows to computer, extra hard drive option, Season Pass, Wish Lists, Online scheduling, Amazon Unbox, monthly service fees can be less. 
Cons:. Up front cost of box, getting cable co to correctly install CableCards, no cable on-demand (but there's Unbox). 
Summary:. **THE EDITORS REVIEW IS NOW OUTDATED. THE TIVO-TO-GO, EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE, AND MULTI-ROOM VIEWING ARE ALL ENABLED NOW!** Both the editor and user ratings would be higher if this was the case previously. There are more new features like on screen Rhapsody music service too.. First off, ignore the people who've abused this review system and rated the product down without having any knowledge or experience with it. Once you take those nay-saying rants out, you'd see the user rating is very high, as it should be. It's very rare to find a TiVo user who regrets their purchase.. I bought a TiVo Series 2 DT 80hr box before this product came out and fell in love with the TiVo interface and extra features. We'd been using the cable company DVR for years and while it had the basic advantages of a DVR (pause live tv, record shows to watch later), it had its share of downfalls. It was difficult to find the shows I wanted to record, the scheduling wasn't very accurate, and it would crash fairly often.. I won't go into all the details of the features of the TiVo HD since the editors review does a nice job with it, but I will correct some things that are now incorrect.. The TiVo-to-Go feature is now enabled which is my favorite feature of all. You can save almost every show you record, including HD programs, to your hard drive to free up space, archive for later, or take with you on a laptop to watch when traveling. The only exception are a few digital channels that have copyright restrictions, but all the major networks work fine. Want to save a whole season of Grey's Anatomy in HD quality? You can! The files are in the original HD quality which can run up to 6.5 GB per hour, so keep that in mind.. Speaking of hard drive space, TiVo now offers a 500 GB "DVR Expander" for $199 that gets you 60 more hours in HD or 600 SD. You have to buy the TiVo certified drive to work, but that is because PC drives are not designed for the incessant writing that DVR's do, and $199 is still a comprable price. Cable company boxes can't compete with this capacity. Even the included 20 hours of HD is more than most cable boxes. If you don't want to spend the extra money on the external drive, you can transfer it to your PC's drive and still access it on your TV, which will stream it off your PC.. The Universal Swivel Search deserves an extra mention too because it's really amazing. Say you're wondering who the actor is you're watching on TV right now.. With 2 clicks you can see who the actor is, what shows or movies he/she's been in, and schedule any of the actor's shows to record or download it instantly from Amazon Unbox. It'll tell you what episodes are coming up for your show and recommend similar shows that you'd like. TiVo has lots of picture and music options too which it will get from your computer, the internet, or Rhapsody where you can stream any full song/album on demand. Rhapsody requires a subscription, but the stuff from your computer is free.. One thing that everyone seems to bash TiVo on is the cost. Yes, I know that $299 is asking a lot when compared to a box you get "free," but you clearly can not view them as equal boxes. I and most any TiVo user you ask would say it's worth the price premium, just like adding options on a car, but consider this.. The TiVo HD could actually save you money over an extended period of time. Say you're paying $15/month for all the cable DVR rental and service fees and associated taxes. You can get TiVo for $8.31 a month if you buy 3 years up front. It obviously takes a while to make up the $299 investment, but in 45 months you will have done it and it will save you money every month after.. TiVo Cast is another cool feature. If you're a gadget fan or CNet fan, be sure to subscribe to the CNet TiVoCast. It is a 15 minute show that showcases some of the newest products so you're always up to date. You can also see what shows celebrities are watching, or what Maxim recommends by using Guru Guides.. One last useful, exclusive feature. Let's say you forgot to set something to record and now you're out of town. With a cable box you're SOL, but with TiVo you just go to TiVo.com, type in the show, and click a button and it's sent to your TiVo box and added to the record list. It'll be there waiting for you when you return.. The only bad thing I can say about the TiVo HD is actually the cable company's fault. Cable companies aren't used to installing CableCards so some people have had trouble finding a cable person who can set it up correctly. It's a simple process, but the people on the phone just aren't used to it. This may be better by now as the device has proliferated the market more... I got mine early on, so by now they may be better trained on it. The other downside is also the CableCard's fault and that's the loss of on-demand programming. Personally, I don't miss it since my TiVo has everything I'd want to watch "on-demand" already. If you ever have any questions or problems, the TiVo support people are really nice, and you can tell they truly value their customers. Try finding that with your cable operator.. I could go on forever, but really you need to just experience it for yourself. With the unbeatble interface, expandable storage, tivo-to-go, and the multimedia options, it is well worth the upfront cost. If you try it and disagree with me, come back and comment on this review. You can always return the box and your first 30 days are risk free with the service too. Basically, if you can overlook the upfront cost you'll be much happier with a TiVo HD.. 

$$;
Pros:. TiVo interface is so easy, it does what it's supposed to.. 
Cons:. Haven't found any.. 
Summary:. I had a Tivo when I had Directv but switched to Verizon FIOS and have had to deal with their DVR since. I am relieved to have Tivo again. No more missed recordings, unwatchable recordings, or other issues. This machine does all the Motorola box does and does it better. The fees for the cable cards and Tivo service are still less than the lease fee for the Verizon box.. 

$$;
Pros:. dual channel recording, superb video playback, perfect interface. 
Cons:. no video on demand, no TIVO to go. 
Summary:. I have owned TIVO units since 1999 and this is clearly the best yet. I have owned 2 HD units since 1/07 and both work flawlessly. The video playback is superb and the new swivel search is a unique addition. Of course I wish it had a 10TB storage disk so that I could keep every movie ever made for easy access, but the new Amazon unbox feature helps in this category giving me virtual video on demand. I also love the remote recording option through tivo.com. It is a GREAT device and no home theater should be without it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Dual Tuner, OTA Support, TIVO Experience. 
Cons:. Not compatible w/Satelite. 
Summary:. Wow I had no idea how many TIVO haters there are!! I have used several generic DVR's including the CNET Editors Choice VIP622 from Dish Network and I'll chose the TIVO over 'em all! I recently cancelled my Dish &#38; went back to Cable just to use the TIVO HD, much better than any generic DVR from any cable co or satalite co.... 

$$;
Pros:. Much cheaper than S3. 
Cons:. None - really. 
Summary:. I don't own a unit and am just questionning the review, which says PPV is not available. Many people say PPV is not available for the S3 as well, but you can order such by phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. works pretty much flawlessly to record OTA shows. Wonderful interface. My wife thinks it is great also. Works to stream Netflix movies.. 
Cons:. stock hard drive is too small. Requires a subscription to use. Ad's are annoying, but are easy to ignore. No way to tell how much of the disk you are using. Is an electricity hog since it is on at all times. Occasionaly the TV guide is wrong.. 
Summary:. The fact is that over the air (OTA) digital broadcasts are better quality than cable and satellite broadcasts. If you want to time shift/record OTA then there are few choices. Luckily the Tivo HD is a great product at a great price. I swapped out the small 160GB HD for a 1TB drive for about $100 and shelled out $400 for the Tivo lifetime membership, which goes with the machine if I decide to sell, so I reccomend lifetime rather than trowing away money. There are used Sony DVR's out there that don't require a subscription, but for what they sell for, you can buy a lifetime Tivo membership. I am a netflix member and like being able to stream movies to my TV. To do this you will need a fast internet conection that can sustain at least 4Mb/s.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up &#38; use. The controls are intuitive, the extras like you tube viewing and remote programing are seamless. Most of all - recording and watching TV shows (its core task) is the best!. 
Cons:. No clock on the TIVO interface - a little cumbersome to bring up a list of what's currently on tv.. 
Summary:. Had TIVo for three months. I use it to record over the air HDTV (no cable or sat TV) and love it. With TIVO, I can watch all of the free programs I love but normally miss (Late night talk, PBS, shows that are on before my three year old goes to bed). TIVO is a great alternative to the endless channels of nothing on cable. Plus you can download movies and TV shows directly to your TIVO. If you are trying to cut costs, and can afford the $300 price tag, I find this a great alternative to cable TV. OIf course you can use it in tandem with cable as well if you choose.. 

$$;
Pros:. The menu's and user interface are really good. Good set-up tech support and nice value added features with portals to Netflix and Amazon. We are setting up for digital images on my TV screen, etc.. 
Cons:. The user interface and screen transitions are sluggish. The remote needs redesigning but works ok.. 
Summary:. TIVO is worth it. Just say NO to boredom with Comcast's Motorola DVR and BUY A TIVO. I was skeptical at first, but now I am a big fan of TIVO.. 

$$;
Pros:. Netflix, Amazon, Rhapsody, You Tube, Picasa, Bucket and more and more. Even order a pizza!. 
Cons:. NETFLIX selection of TV shows &#38; movie downloads for a montly fee are minimal, poorly navigated and sound to video is never matched or close to matched. Sub-standard.. 
Summary:. Still the best DVR out there, TIVO is simply excellent and blows away Dish/Direct/Comcast, etc. So user-friendly. A total value and there will be so many more options to come.. Updated. on Mar 1, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Much cheaper than it's big brother Series 3.. Has lots of HD Video format output options.. Over-the-Air tuner as well as cable tuners.. 
Cons:. Small 160G drive only 20 hours of HD. Only one output other than HDMI. Latest SW version a little clunky.. Remote not as nice as TIVO 3's. 
Summary:. 1st for $300 new or $180 reconditioned this is a great buy even with some of it's limitations. The HD is far cheaper than it's $800 big brother TIVO 3. I've used TIVOs since 2000 and have found them to be a good price for the functionality you get. No DVR I've ever seen is even half a capable as the TIVO DVRs.. The latest software upgrade however has introudced several issues with speed and poor ability to return to previous menus. While wait times are not terribly long, they are annoying as compared to using the older SW versions. TIVO 2 DTs have the same issue now as their SW has also gotten worse. The problem is you'll have no choice on what version you run. The TIVO will upgrade regardless. TIVO seems to be slow on fixing or even acknowledging this problem exists even though hundreds of forum users complain. This is the main reason this unit got only four stars instead of 5.. It covers all the popular video output formats and is capable of all the HD standards. You can als view the output in three different ways regardless of how it was captured.. I got it because I wanted a unit that did over-the air tuning of HD digital broadcasts. This was one thing lacking that always irritated me about my older TIVO 2s. It really depends on your area and listings whether this would be good for you or not. In my area almost all the major networks are doing over-the-aair broacasting and most are better quality HD than from my Cox cable. No cable cards are required for OTA reception and you can still record two things at a time.. One of the negative things was the lack of output options on the TIVO HD. Only one output that is either 3 or 5 component output or S-Video. Only one at a time can be used. No coax outputs and antenna/cable is not passed through this box. If you don't use HDMI for your TV connection, you won't be able to hook up a stereo audio connection or a VCR/DVD recorder as the TV connection takes the only output. Not a good decision by TIVO to actual remove output options that were standard on earlier TIVOs.. Also the ESATA port for TIVO HDs are much more flakey than the TIVO 3 ones. Your options for adding or removing drives through this port are limited severly.. Also I don't mind the peanut remote used with the older TIVO units. But those who have seen the TIVO 3 remote prefer it. I think the TIVO HD remote works fine and if you've had an older TIVO your used to it anyway. I understand you can purchase the better remote if you want it.. The setup on this unit is far simpler than many previous TIVO products. I actually got a defective TIVO HD the first time (bad drive) from Best Buy and had to return it and get another. While the TIVO support people were polite, they will walk you through hours of wasted diagnostics and call-backs if you don't put your foot down to get a final diagnosis. Sometimes you can learn interesting things from these techs though like undocumented tests from your remote and such.. One of the things that is improved with TIVO now is the ability to transfer your initial contract term to a newer box without having to setup a new contract. Numerous times in the past, having to start a new contract on a new box and continue the old one too was very annoying. I'm glad they fixed this. So now, if you buy a new box and want to upgrade to yet another new box before your contract expires you can without starting a new contract. I don't mind paying the $13 per month but hate having to have a contract for any length of time.. All-in-all this TIVO HD's few limitations for the significant difference in price between it and the TIVO 3 makes it a great buy. It works almost as well as the TIVO 3 at $500 cheaper. I am someone who seldom praises a product but have sworn by TIVO boxes since my first in 2000. Unfortunately I don't care much for their customer service but so seldomly need CS that it makes it worthwhile. Now that over-the-air is supported, I can cut Cox cable bill down as well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great User Interface, east to find the shows I want. I love the ability to use Amazon unbox and have shows dropped right onto my Tivo.. 
Cons:. Blank screen when switching from 480 to 720 programs.. 
Summary:. Having upgraded from the Series 2 to HD, I am soo very happy with this unit. My cable provider, Comcast, didn't have any trouble getting the cable card up and running with it and it's just the best thing ever! Not to mention the fact that I have one less device, the absence of the cable box, and one less remote to worry about. I am such a fan of the Tivo interface that using Comcast's DVR was not even something that I wanted to entertain. On the "Bang for the Buck" basis......... BANG!!!!!! The costs have come down on these and I couldn't be happier.. 

$$;
Pros:. Dual OTA tuners, HDMI Output. 
Cons:. Subscription Fees, Small Disk, Documentation. 
Summary:. I purchased this DVR strictly for use with OTA HD programming so the pay-per-view and interactive integration is not an issue for me. Since there simply are no alternatives out there for OTA tuning/recording (Yes, the Sony DHG-HDD250 and DHG-HDD500 are still available on eBay, but that's not a risk I'm willing to take with moving parts) There really isn't much of a choice. I still resent having to pay the fees to Tivo, though. I opted for the three year pre-paid deal to at least minimize the per month costs.. Still, I'm quite pleased with the box, the excellent cnet review below provides better documentation than either Tivo's own web site or even the manual itself! The 30 second skip ahead hack and the eSATA expansion hack are great and solve my only real grips out of the box. Picture and OTA tuning have been excellent.. 

$$;
Pros:. Low Cost HD DVR with Tivo interface. 
Cons:. No TivoToGo or MRV. 
Summary:. The unit does what its supposed to do well. I do wish that Tivo had shipped unit with eSata port active, but I guess I can wait since it is rumored that it along with TivoToGo and MRV will be activate by the end of the year.. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally HD from TiVo at a reasonable price. 
Cons:. Not enough storage space. 
Summary:. As for the Video on Demand issue, the Now Playing function of TiVo offers the same functionality. You can watch a movie or show that you have recorded whenever you like from the Now Playing list in TiVo, so I don't see what is the difference. I would only look at shows or movies from Video on Demand that interest me which are the same shows or movies that I would mostly likely record.. I have always liked the TiVo format more than than my cable companies DVR, so I'm glad this product has been released. I will cancel the DVR service from the cable provider and subscribe to TiVo's service which saves me the same $12.95 a month that I pay to the cable company, so there is no loss on my monthly cost or paying double the cost.. I only wish the 300 hard drive was available at this price. I recommend this product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ability to download movies, TV shows &#38; independently produced programs; ability to access one's Rhapsody and/or Live365 Internet Radio accounts; and ability to access your home computer's photo and music libraries.EXCELLENT antenna/OTA HD support.. 
Cons:. REQUIRES paid subscription. NO support for programmed recording of programs on cable company-provided "clear QAM" HD channels (. 
Summary:. TiVo's video and audio quality of recordings is excellent, and it has a full compliment of HDMI, component, and analog outputs as well as digital (optical) audio output. There is no support for *Internet* downloading of *HD* movies or tv shows yet, but TiVo constantly upgrades its capabilities via automatic OS software updates that download to the TiVo units via its connection to your Internet service provider or to the TiVo service directly via a telephone line connection (but the latter is too slow to be considered practical for most people). Access to Live365's Internet radio service is excellent. TiVo has excellent remote programming capability via Internet and cell phone access, but it is NOT the only dvr brand to have remote programming capability.. TiVo does have one serious shortcoming - if you are one of the many cable company customers who do NOT have a digital set-top box or CableCard decoder and thus have your cable connected directly to your digital "cable-ready" HD tv set: there is no ability to program recording of local HD channels' tv programs transmitted by your cable company on "clear QAM" (non-scrambled digital) channels via TiVo's tv program guide... thus your only options are to either connect an antenna and hope you can get your local HD channels over the air, pay for a more expensive digital cable package or otherwise pay for the cable company's digital set-top box or CableCard (which the TiVo unit has two slots for), or manually program recording based on channel and time rather than program title - TiVo's famed "Season Pass" auto recording feature will NOT work for such situations. To make matters worse in this regard, TiVo's ability to RECEIVE such channels - although present - can be somewhat complicated for even *seasoned* "gadget gurus" and it is somewhat buggy in its implementation as well.. The long and short of it - if you need or want the ability to record over-the-air HD programs, TiVo HD is THE HD dvr to buy, and this is also true if you subscribe to one of your cable company's digital packages that includes use of a set-top box or CableCard(s). And if you really want a dvr unit that can access your home network and can download movies, tv shows and independently produced programs that are available through the Internet, TiVo is the way to go... the price of the hardware is very reasonable but you MUST purchase a monthly, annual, or 3-year subscription as well.. If you subscribe to your cable company's "basic" package and don't use a digital set-top box or CableCard but connect your cable line directly to your HD set and thus get your local stations' HD broadcasts on "clear QAM" channels, and want to record programs on those channels automatically, you might actually do better to purchase the Moxi brand of HD dvr - which fully supports clear QAM channel programing. BUT - the Moxi dvr does NOT support antenna/OTA connection/reception (at least not in its "out-of-the box" configuration), and although it does not require a paid monthly or annual subscription for full functionality it IS much more expensive (around $700 !) than the TiVo HD dvr..

Pros:. Easier to use than cable box DVRs. 
Cons:. Defective Cable cards. 
Summary:. I love TIVO, though when it came time to go HD, I reluctantly gave up my Series 2 and went to the DVR offered by Time Warner. Hated it. It was so user unfriendly compared to TIVO. So I bought the TIVO HDR and was fortunate to get in on the lifetime subscription. But there is a problem... The cable cards provided by Time Warner (I've tried both two single cards and a multistream card) all seem to be defective. After a certain length of time, my screen freezes up on every channel. It plays about 5 seconds of audio while showing a frozen screen, then the audio stops too. I'm waiting for Time Warner to come out for a fourth time tomorrow to once again replace the cards. This has been unbelievably frustrating! And I'm assuming the problems are with the cable cards rather than the TIVO.. Despite it all, I still highly recommend TIVO HD,. 

$$;
Pros:. The Tivo interface, record two shows at once. 
Cons:. cable card fees, cable card glitches. 
Summary:. If you LOVE Tivo, you HAVE to have one of these. We switched to HD and could not get HD programming with our first Tivo so we stayed with the HD box from the cable company because we did not want to plop down $800 for a series 3 Tivo. Then THIS one came out. We were tired of the torture from the Scientific America cable box from the cable company so we jumped at the chance to go back to Tivo.. We LOVE the Tivo interface. BUT, it is not good to have to pay a monthly fee for EACH cable card (you have to get two to record on two channels at once). Plus, we've really had alot of problems with our cable cards. At least every third day one of the cable cards will say its not working and we will have to pop it out and back in again.. At least every other week we will have to completely reboot the Tivo to get the Tivo to work at all.. It pains me to only be able to give this Tivo a 7 out of 10.. 

$$;
Pros:. great interface, great audio &#38; video. 
Cons:. SDV kills it. 
Summary:. I just finished boxing mine up to return. I love Tivo - had one since the Series 1. It was a breeze to setup, and, the interface is - well, it's a Tivo. The extras like Amazon unbox, and access to music &#38; pictures from my Mac are a nice touch. But... My local cable company is goinf to switched digital video - it preparation for that, they are not mapping any new HD channels to cabelcard devices (ie Tivo), so, I was unable to get the 4 new HD channels they added. Until Tivo resolves this, you may find yourself with a Tivo that is unable to get all the channels that are available.. So, CHECK with your local Cable Company regarding Switched Digital Video, and, don't be surprised when they don't know what you are talking about, it may take multiple calls to get the real story. tivocommunity.com and avsforum.com are excellent resources to find out what's happening.. 

$$;
Pros:. Much cheaper than Series3, great Tivo interface. 
Cons:. Have to bank on Tivo's promise to deliver external storage driver and media sharing upgrades. 
Summary:. I have to rebut many of the ill informed posts others have made. First, clearly this product CAN record HD despite what others say to the contrary (I mean get a clue - the name of the freakin' thing is - 'Tivo HD'). Yes, there is a monthly fee and I don't know what other's get from their cable suppliers, Comcast charges me $29 a month for two mediocre Motorola HD-DVRs. Just on monthly savings along, these will pay for themselves in about 30 months plus they are much better product (and I say this as a Tivo user for more than 6 years). The ability to listen to my MP3s and view my photos is great which can't be matched by ANY cable box or DVR. Don't tell Tivo, but I'd pay $100 alone for this feature - think of it as an Apple TV thrown in for free.. The issue with incompatibily with VOD and PPV is not a Tivo issue, it's a cable card issue. Current cable cards don't support "upload" data communication so don't blame Tivo for this. Any cablecard product will have the same issue.. Overall, this will be a great product at the $299 price point and I can't wait to buy TWO of these babies and give back my two HD DVRs to Comcast.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tivo interface is clean, intuitive, and infomative.... 
Cons:. If you can get it set up. 
Summary:. Let me start by saying that I am a big Tivo fan. For all the Tivo haters out there: get over yourselves. It's better than the DVR you rent from the cable company. Don't disaparage the choices of others just because you're thrifty. I had the Hughes hi def directv box for years. When I moved to a condo and was forced into a relationship with cable and a cable company provided DVR, I thought I could adjust, but I just missed my Tivo too much. Compared to Tivo, my cable company provided Scientific Explorer DVR was a complete joke. Navigation was clumsy, menus were anything but intuitive, and simple features, like not recording duplicates, were absent. So YAAAAY for Tivo HD... I was waiting for the S3 to come down in price, but this was my answer.. So I thought.... Getting the thing on your network can be a bear, and once you do, it's downloads are very slow. I twice tried to download 'The Departed' off of Amazon's unbox, and both times failed. Amazon kindly gave me a refund. Navigating the 'Downloads' menu from the Tivo is next to impossible because it's so slow. Use your PC for what you've got to do, instead. You can do almost everything from your computer. I hope the Unbox thing works better for others because it seems like a great idea.. So once you get it on your network (try assigning a static IP btw... it finally got me on) time to test out the cable cards... well, all I can say is that I hope you don't live in Phoenix, and have to deal with the chimpanzees they have "installing" and "teching" your equipment. After 6 hours, EIGHT different cards, signal amplifiers, alternate installers dropping by, etc, etc, etc, they were simply out of ideas. One Cable Card was the best they could do, and no, they don't offer the multistream cards in Phoenix. The one cable card worked in both slots, so it's not the Tivo.. So I played with it for a while... somehow hoping another cable card would be found that would actually work, and I still love the Tivo interface. All in all, though, I was so disgusted with Cox Cable (the installer also shattered a glass shelf in my av center), that I cancelled my service this morning. The Tivo really is no good with just one tuner getting the digital signals. It wasn't designed to do it, so there's no way to set up to, say, only record HBO on tuner 1.. With the money I'll save I'm buying an OTA antenna and a supscription to Netflix.. 

$$;
Pros:. None serves no purpose. 
Cons:. Way too expensive. 
Summary:. I am perfectly happy with my cable company's DVR. The extra cost of TiVO's machine makes no sense.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tivo2go - online scheduling. 
Cons:. Advertising, bugs in cable channel schedule. 
Summary:. I had a series 2 Tivo up until 3 years ago when they dropped the ball on HD (really dropped the ball!) After 3 years with my cable companies Motorola DVR, I was annoyed enough that I thought I'd give the Tivo HD a chance. The Motorola is sluggish and unexpandable despite USB, eSATA etc - all of which are turned off! The Tivo costs more per month and cannot get the schedule of several HD channels. Tivo2go can be nice at times but not enough to justify the $$ - It's back to the cable company DVR for me. I also get much better customer service from my cable company (Armstrong). 

$$;
Pros:. It's a Tivo which makes it great. 
Cons:. Slow as dirt, so slow I can't use it.. 
Summary:. For starters, I love Tivo. I have three of them now, generation one, two, and now the HD Tivo. So you've got someone who loves them, Tivo is basically the Macintosh of TV to the cable company's PC.. My Tivo is slow as dirt. So unbelievably slow that I keep calling customer service because I can't see what's wrong with it. It often does not respond to remote commands until you press it for the thousanth time. I rebooted, I change remotes, I got the latest software, and the thing is still slow. It seems like trying to run a modern game program on a 286 PC.. I just have no idea what is wrong with this thing. I am going to give Tivo one more shot then I'm done with it. Seems I'm a minority here but I had to say something.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is tivo!. 
Cons:. It is tivo!. 
Summary:. Why would you spend hundred of dollars on this thing, and spend a monthly fee on top of that and your regular cable bill for a device that can already do what your comcast or satellite box can do? Ohh. the interface, with the stupid tv figure. And Tivotogo??? No HD!!! What is the point? Just get a media center pc with a third party pvr software like sage or mediaportal even those can record HD local channels. Plus you can view photos, videos, upconverted dvds. Tivo is going down hill fast.. Mo!. 

$$;
Pros:. Performance is good when functioning properly.. Netflix streaming works well.. 
Cons:. Units are unreliable and hang. May need to get a second or third unit.. 
Summary:. Not worth the headache to deal with unit replacement and required deposit to replace the unit. Go with a tv serivce provider dvr (comcast, att, dish network).. 

$$;
Pros:. Best DVR interface and remote I've used.. 
Cons:. Subpar manufacturing or components. Try to cancel service is next to impossible.. 
Summary:. The Tivo line of products has been great for us and I've been a user since 2003. However, Tivo has fell behind and thier media capabilities are way below those of other DVR and media (TV, Movies, Music, Photos) managers/players.. I'm on the phone right now, it has been 20 minutes, and I still have not talked to anyone to cancel my service. I called in 2 times and the system hung up on me evertime I went through the cancel my account prompts. (options 2 then 2). I had to select technical support and then request the agent to forward me over to a group that would cancel my account. Last time I went through this because I wanted to cancel service on an old DVR it took over a week and Tivo constantly argued with me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cable Card support, HD, dual tuner, good looks, great interface. 
Cons:. Cable Companies hate Cablecards, cost per month. 
Summary:. After several attempted calls and a no show appointment, I am without a Cablecard for my Tivo HD. Though I had it set up and ready for the installer, he didnt even call to say that he wasnt showing up. After getting the run around, they admitted that they do not have Cable cards.. I waited a week and they brought one to me, but it was defective. They have asked me to wait another 10 days, but they are unsure if they will have a working card for me at that time.. Comcast doesnt care about my situation, because they discourage the use of Cablecards. With this said, I think that this unit may be a very expensive Tivo Series II, until I succeed in getting the Cablecard installed.. Be aware of the blockade.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks cool in cabinet, great picture, Tivo software is pretty good.. 
Cons:. Costs too much for what you get.. 
Summary:. My main gripe is that I just don't see the advantage to buying this versus using the free Comcast box - By free I mean no initial fee. Plus, I bought this thing and it went bad on DAY 91, I was told that I would have to pay a $45 fee to get the box replaced, as you might imagine I was a little dismayed. I mean, I paid $300 for it, then was paying a monthly fee, plus renting the cable cards from Comcast. So I packed it up and returned it to Costco (they have a very liberal return policy) and I got the new Comcast HD DVR - same HD, plus I get on demand and if it goes bad I swap it at my local Comcast office.. 

$$;
Pros:. can record more than one program at a time. 
Cons:. constant stream of fees. 
Summary:. I will not purchase any piece of hardware that requires me to pay a monthly utility bill to use it. I have used super VHS and digital VCRS for over 20 years and I have yet to pay a single bill to program them. I can move my tapes around to various machine and even bring them to my neighbors for viewing. I do not have to worry whether there is a copy flag on the program or other digital trash that is creeping into our fair use rights that even the reactionary supreme court agrees is ours. I want a DVR that lets me record 2,3, or 4 channels at once and I can program at my leisure. Dish TV has one that is not bad, but others don't seem to have that model and it is not available, to my knowledge, as a free standing unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally an HD dvr that is "affordable". 
Cons:. Tivo service is a rip off. 
Summary:. I was all excited when I learned about the new HD Tivo, but I refuse to buy the pretty interface for a monthly fee. A few months ago I purchase a media center PC to record HD OTA, but would gladly buy this device if they would offer it with just basic features.. Why cant I record HD over the air VCR style ? No program guide, just FF, RW, PAUSE...I know whats on tv, and do not need this monthly Tivo "support". 

$$;
Pros:. Great unit, when it works.. 
Cons:. Poor customer service. The CS agents are unwilling or unable to react quickly.. 
Summary:. Happy customer for years and recently upraged to an HD unit online. The unit shiped would re-boot sporadically and I had to return it. Resolution took weeks. Staring to question if the service is worth having.. 

$$;
Pros:. Streaming Netflix is nice when it works. Better video quality than our previous DVR.. 
Cons:. Scheduled recording from television will frequently fail to record anything. Sometimes the Tivo operating system hangs and won't respond to anything until we pull the power plug.. 
Summary:. After reading many positive reviews, and listening to CNET podcasts recommending the Tivo systems, we purchased one with a lifetime subscription to replace our RCA DVR. Unfortunately the Tivo isn't as reliable. Scheduled recording from television will frequently fail to record anything. Technical support informed us that this is a 'known problem' with the analog tuner. The only way to fix the problem is to reboot the device. Sometimes the Tivo operating system hangs and won't respond to anything until we pull the power plug.. 

$$;
Pros:. Records HD, great user interface. 
Cons:. Upfront Fees, monthly fee for box you own exceeds charge for box from cable company that has no up front cost.. 
Summary:. I bought my first Tivo box in 2002 and sang Tivo's merits to all who would listen. I bought one for my dad as a father's day gift an another for the best man at my wedding. In 2005 the hard drive died and for $99.00 Tivo transferred my life time warranty to another box. My late 2006 the Tivo Box lost its spot in the living room. Tivo could not record HD and the cable company had a HD-DVR that could record HD-HBO. The user interface of Tivo was nice but come on how hard is it to program a cable company DVR.. In late 2008 the Hard Drive in the replacement Tivo DVR broke. With a Tivo DVR hard drive its not a question of if it will break its a question of when. Tivo's solution either buy a new standard def Tivo for $200 and pay another $150 to transfer the lifetime subscription of get a small discount off an HD-Tivo that brings the price down from Tivo retail to a competitive on-line price. A discount worth essentially nothing.. Before getting a Tivo for the 2nd TV in the house, I may as well just get a 2nd HD-DVR from bright-house. My cable company will charge less per month to rent a box that I do not have to buy then Tivo would charge me to use my own box. The dancing Tivo and its chirp are cute but not that cute.. Its time for Apple or Comcast to buy Tivo. Their intellectual property could help Comcast compete with Direct TV or Apple/AT&#38;T could make the box that Apple TV could have been. Tivo was 2 years to late to go HD, and its unreliable products make purchasing a product lifetime warranty risky. Tivo was once the "i-phone" of its day... it won an emmy award and had a South Park episode dedicated to it but Tivo seriously lost its way and is no longer relevant.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's functionally good, reasonably easy to set up and operate. Netflix on demand is cool.. 
Cons:. I'm floored by the in-menu advertising. Do you want to [a] watch this show, [b] delete this show, [c] order Domino's [R] Pizza. Yes it's that bad. Customer service says you can't disable the inline advertising, even though it's a paid service.. 
Summary:. If you're offended by Domino's advertising in your face whenever you change the channel, i suggest you consider an alternative DVR.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice features. 
Cons:. Slow, slow, slow and the bells, beeps and cutsie stuff in annoying. 
Summary:. Really slow hardware and clunky software (not to mention a really poorly designed remote) turned a pretty good DVR, with lots of features, into an Edsel. I would rate this DVR as follows based on hands-on experience:. 1. Dish Network ViP622. 2. FiOS Motorola. 3. Sony DHG-HDD500. 4. Tivo HD. 5. Comcast Motorola. 6. Adelphia/Comcast SA8300HD DVR. 

$$;
Pros:. The Tivo functionality is far and away better than DVR.. 
Cons:. The customer service is horrible.. 
Summary:. I love the functionality of the Tivo HD, but unfortunately I'll be getting a DVR when my current Tivo subscription expires thanks to the horrible customer service experience. Essentially, I purchased a buggy Tivo HD, then Tivo sent the replacement to the wrong address and essentially held me responsible for their error. I finally received resolution of the issue after many phone calls and hours of lost time. I work as a developer of Help Desk applications so I'm very familiar with Help Desk business process. I understand that mistakes can happen, but I'm more disappointed with the complete lack of professionalism and caring on the part of the "level 2" agents that I encountered. I'm trying to get the word out to as many folks as possible just so that everyone can understand the risk that is involved when buying a new Tivo.. Here's a timeline of the event that occurred.. Oct 20 - I purchased Tivo HD from Amazon.com. Oct 25 - The Tivo HD was delivered.. Oct 27 - I set up the Tivo HD in preparation for the CableCard installation. The process goes well and without problems. I notice some time later that night that there aren't any lights on on the Tivo HD, but it doesn't strike me as odd at that point.. Oct 28 8 AM - I wake up and start preparing the area around my TV for the CableCard installation. I notice that the Tivo HD doesn't have power. I change the power cords and the outlets, but the Tivo still doesn't have any power. We cancel the CableCard installation. I call support and am told that the support system is down due to time change. The time change did not occur that weekend. Total time with support: approx. 10 minutes.. Oct 28 1 PM - I call support back and speak with the same agent that I spoke with earlier in the day. He initially quotes a fee of $45 for the exchange, but after clarification, he realizes his mistake and sets up the advanced exchange (unknown to me at the time that he's setting it up to be sent to the wrong address). I choose the "advanced" option so I have to authorize a charge of $323. The support agent does not give us a receipt for return shipment. Total time with support: approx. 30 minutes.. Nov 1 11 AM - I note that the exchange Tivo HD sent is to Texas instead of our address in California. My wife calls support to get the exchange Tivo HD sent to correct account. The support agent tells her that the matter would be sent to an investigator and that we would be contacted sometime the same day. Total time with support: approx. 45 minutes.. Nov 1 6 PM - We had not been called back so I call support. I am sent to level 2. The level 2 agent states that she can understand our frustration and that she's sorry for the poor support up to this point. She states that the agent that worked on the issue earlier in the day was known to not do a good job and that she had "messed up" the ticket. She said that she would send a new exchange Tivo HD and that it would be sent next day delivery. She gives us a receipt for return shipment. She states that might take a "couple of days" to get the credit back from the first exchange, but that I would have to again authorize a charge of $323 for the advanced exchange. Total time with support: approx. 45 minutes.. Nov 6 - Exchange Tivo HD is delivered. Not exactly next-day delivery.. Nov 7 - I send the broken Tivo HD back to Tivo.. Nov 12 - I get confirmation that Tivo received the broken Tivo HD.. Nov 15 - I call support in order to query on why the first exchange authorization has not been credited to my account. I am directly sent to level 2. The level 2 agent assures us that we would get our money back and that she would research the issue and call us back the next day. She never contacts us. Total time with support: approx. 45 minutes.. Nov 20 - I call support to query why we haven't received a credit to our account and to ask why we didn't get a call back from the agent who said that she'd call us back. The agent says that she's sorry, but the issue was sent to billing and that there's nothing that can be done. She says that we must wait 14 days. I tell the agent that the support to this point has been lacking and that Tivo has done nothing to keep me as a customer. At this point, I've very frustrated and finally loose my patience with the situation. After about 5 minutes of heated discussion the call is ended. Total time with support: approx. 35 minutes.. Nov 23 - Received the first refund of deposit.. Dec 2 - Finally received the second refund of deposit..

Pros:. I don't see any for cable subscribers. 
Cons:. Why pay for this thing?. 
Summary:. My dual-tuner High-Def DVR that I get from my cable company costs me an extra $12.95/month. Why in the world would I want to lay out hundreds of dollars for this thing and then pay $60 MORE per year in user fees that I'm already paying?. If TiVo wants ANY chance to succeed with cable customers, they're going to have to eliminate their monthly fee OR reinstitute a reasonable (less than $200) lifetime subscription. This product offers no advantage to anyone but those who get only OTA broadcasts, and what fraction of the market is that these days?.

Pros:. moxi beats tivo hands down. 
Cons:. monthly fee. 
Summary:. if you have charter moxi, tivo is being left behind ubfortunately. I used to love my tivo, but now buh-bye tivo.. 

$$;
Pros:. dual tuner, HD capability, none HD capacity. 
Cons:. no Tivo-To-Go , no transfer from PC to Tivo HD. 
Summary:. I was even willing to pay for the Series 3 Tivo, as high as it is, until I found out there's no Tivo-To-Go features available on the Series 3. Now we have a striped down Series 3 called Tivo HD and still no Tivo-To-Go.. I transfer a lot of my Tivo recording the week prior to going on vacation and then transfer them (after Tivo-To-Go's long conversion times) to my iPod (and maybe soon to a ZEN Vision W) so my wife &#38; I can watch them at the airport and on the the flight to our vacations. It's made a world of difference on our flights.. Series 3 and Tivo HD still don't offer Tivo-To-Go? No sale then. Solve the problem with Cable Labs and be done with it, for Pete's sake!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything to love about Tivo. 
Cons:. At 2 years and 7 months it totally died. To exchange, they want $149. Why did it up and die the same day it downloaded an update from Tivo... one wonders. Oh, and when it does work, it doesn't work with cable movies on demand.. 
Summary:. Pissed off that it died.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice product.. 
Cons:. Terrible customer service.. 
Summary:. I was double billed for a year (prepaid for full year and my credit card was billed the monthly fee) and I was refused a refund. I was told the company policy was to only go back 90 days. It was REALLY hard to get phone numbers to supervisors. Phone calls were not returned. They never did agree to credit my charge account for the amount which I was billed twice for. I finally let it go because they just wore me down with their noncooperative, rude phone customer service people. They wouldn't give out supervisors names, phone numbers, or e-mail address. When I did get a response to an e-mail I sent on my answering machine my return calls were not returned. Tivo customer service was VERY user unfriendly.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Tivo user interface is excellent!. 
Cons:. Very bad customer support. No discount on upgrades or replacement of defective products. Very difficult to reach technical support and not helpful. 
Summary:. My first Tivo stopped working 16 months after I bought it but it was out of warranty and Tivo offered no discount on the replacement so I had to shell out the full price on a replacement. Next, when they came out with their NetFlicks interface, they announced that it wouldn't work on my unit, so I'd have to upgrade to a new unit. Only problem is that they offered no discount on the upgrade. In other words, I have to buy 3 units over a period of less than 2 years of service. This company seems not to care about keeping customers. What a shame!. 

$$;
Pros:. Provides jobs for those that assemble this thing. 
Cons:. No Firewire Interface. 
Summary:. I have the Motorola 6416 for my Verizon Fios service. The non-upgradable,dinky 160Gb disk made me look at the Series 3 carefully.. The FCC had mandated that Cable boxes have a Firewire connection but I guess Tivo was not listening.. With my JVC D-VHS, I can record every channel onto D-VHS tape that I subscribe to but with the Series 3, once you hit that DELETE button, your recording is gone forever.. This thing would cost me the rental of cable card(s), a significantly higher monthly fee and unlike my Motorola DVR, it is NOT free.. Add to that the fact that I can not record anything in High Def and it leaves me wondering who in there right mind would buy this thing.. If all you want is a DVR for OTA High def programming, go buy a cheap PC and stick a $50 HDTV card in it.. Download one of the may UI's like Sage or Mediaportal and you have a superior DVR with limitless recording capacity.. 

$$;
Pros:. Finally a reasonable cost HD DVR. 
Cons:. No support for satellite TV connection. 
Summary:. I was very excited to see that I could finally replace my TiVo Series-2 DVR with a HD version for a reasonable cost...or so I thought. But in reading the device's spec, there's no HDMI input and their product description specifically points out that it does NOT support for satellite TV. I have resisted buying a Dish Network HD DVR (I have Dish HD Receiver) because I prefer the TiVo interface, hoping that TiVo would one day provide such a device. But by not suporting satellite TV, it seems like TiVo will lose customers who have no other choice but to drop them in favor of a Satellite TV supplied HD DVR.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well with Netflix when the network card works.. You can even record to the Hard drive, when they work.. You can hook up an extender, it can't be used for backing up. The tivo actual uses it as an extension not as a backup. 
Cons:. You can't select shows to record while watching a show along with not being able to record the volume of two shows at the same time. The programming is more complex than other DVR. Support has limited hours if you need to get extended help.. 
Summary:. Do not purchase the extended warranty. I purchased a 3 year extended warranty and my tivo broke after 8 months. We put up with the initial Tivo even though it would not record voice on both turners at the same time like advertised, but when the network card went out, we thought we would get it serviced. The network card went bad, so they sent me another unit, which had a hard drive failure within one day. I got a second exchange and was told my extended warranty would not cover the replacement unit and is void after the 1st exchange.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it is working, it can record two shows at once. That is the only reason I bought this product.. 
Cons:. Company does not stand behind product; warranty is only 90 days. Product failed within 90 days, and was replaced. Product failed again, this time just past 90 days, and it was out of warranty, so they wanted a $50 fee to replace it.. 
Summary:. The sensor that picks up the signal from the remote was defective, and the unit was replaced. It turned out that one of my remotes was also defective, and that had a very short warranty so they did not replace it. The DVR itself also has a very short warranty, only 90 days. The replacement DVR also failed, and this time it was rebooting itself over and over, all day. It was beyond the 90 days, so they wanted to charge a $50 fee to replace it. I will cancel my service as soon as I have time to shop for a similar product and service from some other company. TiVo also has software that allows you to save shows onto a PC, but this software is buggy as well. When my TiVo was shipped back for replacement, I lost a lot of my recorded shows because they would not transfer to my PC with the buggy software. If I record any shows in HD or high quality, those shows cannot be transferred to PC. Those shows were lost when I shipped my DVR. No appliance should be made that cannot work for one year. A warranty tells you something about a manufacturer. It tells you how long you can expect the product to last. The fact that TiVo does not provide a standard one-year warranty should tell you something. If you buy this product, be prepared to pay another $50 every three months to replace it, and that goes for the remote as well.. Updated. on Apr 10, 2010.

Pros:. box looks nice. 
Cons:. freezes, horrible customer service, minimal warranty. 
Summary:. Our first Tivo started to freeze after about a year. Spent $400 when this series came out 6 months ago and now this new tivo is freezing. We have to restart the tivo every day. When it freezes at night it does not record the shows it was supposed to. What a pain! Called Tivo support and had a horrible experience. Was told i would need to pay to get a replacement for their product screwing up (for the second time!). Person i spoke with was rude. Do not waste your money on Tivo. Go with your cable companies DVR box, they will replace it for you, and not charge you for a replacement!. 

$$;
Pros:. HD is a +++++. 
Cons:. NO in-demand recording..... 
Summary:. it's not compatible with your cable company's interactive and video-on-demand services, BOOOO TiVo. Billy Amato (NYC).
