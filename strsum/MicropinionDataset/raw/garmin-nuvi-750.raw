Pros:. This GPS works great everytime. I use this all the time. This unit has never let me down from Pa to FL many many many times! I. 
Cons:. Some times it has a hard time picking up signal in the house when I try to pre program my route. It does have all the normal signal limitations that every GPS has.. 
Summary:. All in all you can not go wrong with this unit for the money. Way better than any Tom Tom. Not to mention its really cool showing off your high end GPS. I wanted a high end gps with high end function but really couldnt afford it. This gps allowed me to have to have the best of both worlds.These had a big price tag when they came out, prices have really dropped. I paid under $200.00 and its been going strong for more than 3 years! I have used this in many big cities and never no problems. DC, ATL, MIA, HRB, all up and down the east coast from PA to FL. Love it Love it Love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely easy to use...voice clear and audible. Kept transmission signal very well in spite of where we were (forest and mountains). Trip recalculation was very quick.. 
Cons:. Key board a little cumbersome.. 
Summary:. We went camping in NC...it got us from SC to the NC mountains through the treacherous route 80, straight to the camp ground with pin point accuracy. We could not have asked for better results!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good sized screen, touch sensitive, Text to speech is excellent. Solid mount. Works every time,but takes a little getting used to.. 
Cons:. No user manual supplied...have to download it, via Acrobat.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, can't believe I waited this long to buy this product. 
Cons:. Can't find one yet!. 
Summary:. Great product for the price, would buy again.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like everything about this unit. Slimness, ease of use, easily found POI. You don't even need to read the owner's manual to get started.. 
Cons:. The one thing I don't like is the annoying voice telling me it's recalculating every time it does so. I wish it would just do the job and not tell me about it.. 
Summary:. So many features at such a good price. I bought it from Tiger Direct for $199. Rapid service from them.. One thing is not mentioned in the review and a pleasant little surprise. On highways, a little white box shows up at the left side of the screen. It has the current speed limit. So you are never in doubt as to what it is. This shows up sometimes in areas where you need to slow down. I watched and it changed from 55mph to 45mph immediately as I passed a speed limit sign announcing that very thing. Nice little plus.. I like the Where Am I feature. One reson I got a gps in the first place was the idea that I could be found if I was in an accident and my car (or I) couldn't be seen from the highway. Paranoia at it's finest, I guess.. My voice of choice is a male British. Very soothing. He tells me the street names AND says the name of my Via Point/Destination when I come to them. I can see that it would say the name of a store as I pull up, but it will also tell me I'm arriving at "Mary Smith on the left".. I had a Garmin Street Pilot but wanted the slimmer nuvi to carry in my purse when I get out of the car. I have it mounted on the dash and love the cradle. Easy on/easy off and you get the added benefit of charging the unit while you drive along.. In between my 2 Garmins, I foolishly, bought a TomTom One XLS. Ugh. Not for me thanks.. I definitely recommend the Garmin nuvi 750. Both the Street Pilot and the TomTom have been passed on to grandchildren. Who appreciate them because they didn't have to pay for them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen, easy to read and like the choice of icons for your car in the maps.. 
Cons:. Have none as yet, it will arrive on Christmas.. 
Summary:. Took a ride in my brothers rv and the screen detail and directions were great. Am looking forward to the help it offers while traveling off my usual route.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sat pickup is above average, even within buildings. Battery life is a 10 out of 10, and much better than a TomTom. USB charger enables me use my BlackBerry chargers for my phone and this unit, which kicks the llamas ass. It is amazing.. 
Cons:. No complaints. Love this unit...exceptional build, price, craftmanship and battery life. Nary a bad word for it.. 
Summary:. It's incredible. But to sum it up in two words? Bad. Ass.. Make sure you pick one up for that special someone this xmas, neither one of you will be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Drove through city and country, many trips and never got lost once.. I tried "Where am I" it was very quick to give co-ordinates, installled GPS co-ordinates, then used unit to take me directly there.. Used "off road" setting, very accurate.. 
Cons:. Am concered about scratching the screen but anyone can protect it using some clear self adhesive film, would like a protective hard case included also a more intensive manual without having to download it from the internet.. 
Summary:. so many features installed, manual too vauge to understand how everything works.. Amazing unit , I recommend this to anyone who does not need "Bluetooth" features, if they are needed then chose the Nuvi 760 with "Bluetooth ". or to travel to Europe then move up to the Nuvi 770.. Am very pleased, pros greatly out weigh the cons. 

$$;
Pros:. I really like that this product is easy to use and easy to navigate through the menu. I always get signal when the device is plugged into the car. This is a great product, just as good, if not better than its competitors!. 
Cons:. I usually only get signal when the device is plugged into my car, it cannot be wireless.. 
Summary:. This is a great product and I would reccomend it to anyone who gets easily lost like me! I always feel confident with the garmin nuvi guiding me and my driving!. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful display, great poi's, great preformance. 
Cons:. none that I have found. 
Summary:. Don't hesitate to get this unit. It's great!. 

$$;
Pros:. A BIG BRIGHT Screen and Easy to use. 
Cons:. Weak FM transmitter. 
Summary:. I recently purchased the Nuvi 750 and used it to drive 450 miles from Cleveland to Downtown Manhattan. It worked flawlessly and despite a mistake or two on my part the unit quickly recalculated and I was back on track. Now I can travel with complete confidence and the freedom to go anywhere effortlessly.. A week later I took it on a trip to Vegas where it guided me from the airport to the Mirage Hotel including navigating the parking lot. That same day it took me to the Hoover Dam. 4-days later I used it to find Red Rock Canyon where it knew about every little path there was for a car to follow. I don't know what more you could expect from a GPS.. I have read a few reviews where there were complaints about the recalculation speed. My recommendation is to load the Garmin WebUpdater on your computer and let it update both the firmware and software of the device. How can anyone expect this device to perform at peak efficiency if its not updated with the latest firmware/software?. Mine works like a champ. Its the best purchase I have made in a long time!. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth, Screen, Support. 
Cons:. No so customisible. 
Summary:. I returned the TomTom 720 and purchased this unit. It works with my bluetooth phone and it is viewable in bright sun. The TomTom failed in both those areas.. TomTom 720 has more options to than the Garmin 760. I liked being able to set up the screen the way I wanted. With the Garmin it is pretty much set, I will hope for it in a firmware update. I wish they would add RV/Truck as a vehicle type.. Routing software for your PC is not included. A quick (very quick) call to Garmin support fixed that. It is in the mail to me now at NO charge. Thanks Garmin!. 

$$;
Pros:. Ready to go out of the box. 
Cons:. Can be pricey, but BB did price match. 
Summary:. First GPS unit. Checked 600 series, 700 series, and the 350. Read alot of reviews and went with this Nuvi 750. Did not need bluetooth capabilities but like the extra benefits of the 750 over the other units. GPS catches satellite signal very quickly. Re-routes in a hurry and features such as where am I? is a plus. Tells immediate direction to police, hospital, fire if needed. Also when unhooked from car mount will remember where your vehicle is at if you put in pedestrian mode, handy if you are ina large parking arena sports, shopping etc...ten routes is nice feature. Voice is easy to understand even when not hooked to fm radio, that works excellent also in your car. Text to speech is great feature you do not have to look at the unit, overall very happy with purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive controls, great screen, awesome accuracy, well built sturdy bracket. 
Cons:. near useless FM transmitter, outer plastic case may be fragile. 
Summary:. I have owned a Quest for three years and have been extremely satisfied. The Quest still does things that the Nuvi does not do. However, the Nuvi 750's big viewing surface an the touch screen controls won me over. In addition, the 750 does multiple via points and can save multiple routes(just like the Quest, not possible with the 300 and 600 Garmin series.. Earlier this year, I bought but returned a Tom Tom 720 because of poor accuracy, a too busy viewing screen and a flimsy mounting bracket. The Nuvi 750 was worth the wait.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gets a signal INDOORS!! Wide screen. Excellent quality. 
Cons:. No Blue Tooth and FM transmission is poor. Even in the house right beside the radio antenna, it is still fuzzy.. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS unit and I received it as a gift. The unit is great and does the job well. The controls take a bit to remember where everything is.. My biggest complaint is the very poor FM transmission. Never clear. always fuzzy. 

$$;
Pros:. Route planning and MP3 Player. 
Cons:. Maybe my books were missing but there was not much information about advanced features. This unit is a very capable GPS but you have to experiment a lot to know how to use it well.. 
Summary:. I have traveled over 30,000 miles using this GPS. It's basic features are very easy to use and typically the GPS is very accurate. It was a little pricy but the extra features have been very useful on long trips.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price (217 including tax), ease of use, text to voice clarity, features. 
Cons:. None yet, first GPS. 
Summary:. I had to convince the wife that we needed it, once she experienced it, well, the rest is history. I had to constantly pry it from her hands as she located mall after mall. The extra features found in other more expensive models were in my opinion, overkill. I have XM radio and bluetooth with hands free dialing already. you cant go wrong by purchasing this unit. By the way, BB had it listed at 481.00, I scanned it with my G1 phone, showed a local store had it for 198.00, and they matched it. So as you can imagine, I am very happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Map View speed limits, vehicle speed and compass; quick to recalculate route; tripometer at the touch of a button; new GoogleMaps interface is awesome.. 
Cons:. When getting directions, the compass no longer displays; need a handlebar mount for this series.. 
Summary:. I don't know what these guys are complaining about. This is a solid unit with quick acquisition of the satellites (suburban Chicago). Had trouble connecting (upon start up) in the Loop but somewhat expected in the canyons. It recalculates my routes instantanously and the accuracy issue about distance to turns is uncalled for. By the time I hit several hundred feet to the turn, there's no question where the turn is so not sure I need immediate feedback 20 feet away. For the discounted price ($200), it's a great value.. 

$$;
Pros:. The price is pretty decent for this 4.3 wide screen model. Liked it for the simple design. Its pretty accurate. Read some reviews and so far Garmin is the highest rating. For the most part its easy to use.. 
Cons:. Battery doesn't seem to last that long. I was using it for about 40 mins and it died. However, it did charged up quickly. It doesn't have the wall outlet power charger.. 
Summary:. Accuracy is the main thing. Getting the right direction to your destination with a piece of mind. I've read other reviews and on their test the Garmin beats Tom Tom and Navigon. Navigon got me tempted for the free traffic report that they throw in for the life of the product. But I've heard that its not that accurate. Tom Tom uses Tele atlas and I heard this is not as accurate for the North America region.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth, Interface, Deep resources, Traffic!. 
Cons:. Nothing major. 
Summary:. I bought this unit for my wife. Let's stop right there for a second. My wife is not technologically inclined. She hates tech things. She's managed to use the GPS, the handsfree interface with her phone, the traffic updates, calculator, and even the link up to her radio for audio playback. That's really impressive. It speaks volumes about how committed Garmin is to the user experience.. The screen is crisp, bright, and easy to figure out. The 3D mapping is the best I've seen. I use a Pioneer with NavTraffic, and this unit is better at 1/4 the price.. Don't dismiss the extra features. We're in California, and there's a handsfree cell phone law. This unit marries to most cell phones, and can even send a radio signal on an FM frequency for amplification of calls.. Traffic reports come in over the car charger, and they seem pretty accurate.. Battery life is terrific. I can't find much wrong with the unit. The cell phone hookup could have better audio I suppose, but it does its job pretty darn well.. It's a good piece of technology, and worth the price (got this unit for under $300 dollar at CostCo on sale).. It's a buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and setup. Very intuitive.. 
Cons:. Points of interest could be easier to use.. 
Summary:. I've owned the unit for 2 or 3 days now and am very pleased. Bought a unit and returned it in less than 24 hours since it was clearly defective and would not take a charge. Replacement unit is fine. Charged quickly and holds charge quite well. Unit is pretty quick to find satellites - even sitting in my family room!!!!! I have found NO problem with unit being sluggish either in reporting when I need to turn or in route recalculations which literally happen in seconds after missing a turn. The only minor complaint is the points of interest feature could be easier to use. The Destinator software had very easy to use points of interest so I guess I'm spoiled with that.. I formerly used Destinator software with an external GPS antenna with an iPaq and have found this Garmin unit to be MUCH superior so I must admit that I'm kind of stumped to see so many say they have had problems with unit. Perhaps I got lucky and Garmin's quality control leaves something to be desired, but based on my limited experience with this, I would have to say that I highly recommend it.. P.S. I have a feeling the original unit I purchased had been previously purchased and returned since it did not look like a factory packaged product when I opened it so I can't blame Garmin for the 1st unit's fault. Perhaps the previous owner dropped it or did something else to damage it. I opened the 2nd unit before leaving the store and it looked fine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen, text to voice is great, fairly simple to use. MP3 player is decent . Aesthetically pleasing design. Overall great GPS for the money!. 
Cons:. Sometimes a bit slow on alerting you when to turn. No Bluetooth.. 
Summary:. Picked this up for less than $200 dollars and for the screen size and the features it offers, you can't beat it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen. 
Cons:. Sluggesh and lacks intuive action. 
Summary:. This is my second GPS. The performance is a nominal improvment over my Magellan at double the price! Screen is beautiful and clear at all time regardless of lighting conditions. Voice interface is clear and easily adapted to taste. The flaw is performance. The antenna is poor in all but optimal conditions. This yields slow start up and often times late instructions for turns and actions. The POI is incredible complete and may be too great for the processing power. POI requests can be slow as the unit works its way through the massive data base.. Overall this is the best auto GPS I have ever seen. Unfortunately, the price would expect even beter. Garmin is best in class but their lower priced offerings yield much better price to performance to assesments.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. 
Cons:. didnt have major POI. 
Summary:. i have had the 750 for a few hours and when "asked" for directions to my local grocery store, the location did not come up. All of the other stores in the chain came up except this one. This is the largest and newly refurbished. I am concerned that i will have a problem in the future using this gps.. 

$$;
Pros:. The auto sensing of light conditions, the clear screen.. 
Cons:. Sometimes if there were a number of streets close to one another, it would tell you to turn left or right before you were your were actually on the street you needed to turn from.. 
Summary:. Overall it was a very nice GPS - It seemed to take for ever to find the satalites when I 1st powered the unit on every time I used it. Also took a fare amount of time to download the maps each time. I did return it though because I really felt that I needed the "Street Name" mentioned rather than just turn left or turn right which I mentioned was confusing at times. Another thing was that if you were sitting close to an entrance to a freeway, but had no idea how to get to the ramp going in on direction or the other, it would simply display go North on I405 but would not provide help in getting you to the proper Ramp in the 1st place.... The GPS in my wife's lexus is my bechmark, so my expectations are high, very high... 

$$;
Pros:. Sacramento, CA and no problems acquiring or maintaining a signal. Display is nice and sharp. Announcing street names for all GPSs should be a staple. Intuitive interface for the first time user.. 
Cons:. Disappointed with late prompt to make turns or change lanes/off ramps. Inclined to think it's underpowered v. defective. In my other band GPSs, there was an option to have the commands sooner/later. FM transmitter is a waste and not worth using.. 
Summary:. Because of the sluggish performance, I would probably not buy this unit again. For the price you can't complain too much. You can pick up one of these units for about $200 at Costco or online right now, so for the money is not a bad deal. You might want to consider the MIO 300 for slightly less and fewer bells and whistles. Let's face it, a GPS should get you accurately and efficiently from Point A to Point B, everything else is a nice to have.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Garmin thankfully announces Street Names. It also says the names of roads as you pass.. 
Cons:. Horrible startup reception. It usually takes the Garmin a good 4-5 minutes before it acquires satellite signals, which is a long time when you're eager to get going.. 
Summary:. It's not terrible, especially once it gets going, but if I were to buy another, I would find one that had better reception.. 

$$;
Pros:. The touch screen is very responsive and pretty accurate. 
Cons:. Sometimes it won't pick up ANY satellite signal. 
Summary:. This review is only a snippet of my full review on gpselector.com. At first I was excited and impressed but the longer I owned it (about 3 months now) the more "little things" I would come to realize did not work. For example, sometimes it won't find any satellite signals and I drive around in circles like I would have done without a GPS (ironically) in the first place. Also, the search by name is pretty useless because it is so slow. When you are driving on the road you want to know where the nearest "DXSDX" now and not in 5 min from now.. The nuvi 750 does have its plus sides though. The touch screen is sensitive and accurate, so when I touch a "t" for example, I don't get an x. That really would be too much.. All in all, the nuvi 750 seems like it should still be in beta and not released. Definitely not worth $300+, that's for sure.. 

$$;
Pros:. Brigtht screen. 
Cons:. Sluggish re-calculations, loses signal constantly. 
Summary:. After reading rave reviews in a GPS magazine (can you say bias?), I decided to make the jump to the over-priced Garmin. I am completely disappointed. My Magellan, at one-third the price has a much quicker start time and better signal sensitivity. I've used other Garmin's...they are great...but they dropped the ball on this line. Stay Away !!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap, usually reliable, good battery life. 
Cons:. Slow, sometimes offers odd routes. 
Summary:. Good deal for the $$, but you get what you pay for. The reception has been great in Phoenix/Metro up to Vegas and Cali. I have not once, even while in a mountain pass, lost reception. Battery lasts several days with moderate use. It's usually very accurate however sometimes it gives you strange, non efficient routes, and usually by the time it recalculates your direction you've missed your turn. I would advise this unit for light travel and to navigate a city that you are somewhat familiar with.. 

$$;
Pros:. there are some cool settings. 
Cons:. to many problems. 
Summary:. Well I picked up the 750 about a week ago when i got home the unit mount was missing so i took it back and got another one.. ok so i hooked it up everything was working. the next day when I went to use it there was no sound so i checked my sound settings and they were 100% but i still couldnt hear anything. I decited try the FM setting WOW why was that feature even put on there it was like the people who made this product half assed it.. Ok so i took it back and got another one thinking theres no way i could get another messed up unit so hopefully this one works good.. Dont get me wrong the unit works OK and their's alot of cool settings.. Just maks sure you dont try to use the FM setting its Crap.. 

$$;
Pros:. large touch screen, bright. 
Cons:. slow to tell you when a turn is coming. 
Summary:. My first GPS and a bit of a disappointment. Traveling at 65 mph on 3-4 lane roads it's not nice to tell me just a few seconds before I need to be in a certain lane. Also some of the routes it picks are nuts. I still haven't figured out it's logic in route selection changing fastest/shortest hasn't helped with some mysterious routes it's tried to send me on. I'm hopeful some system upgrade will help but I'm not expecting we'll see much improvement in this model unless enough people complain.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like how it finds new ways to disappoint me.. 
Cons:. Horrible performance. 
Summary:. This is my 2nd and probably my last Garmin. The last one I had was older but way better. I got rid of it cause the screen was a bit small, but this one is really a piece of shiitake. It is wicked slow to respond. When it is not on a route it randomly starts telling me to make turns. One time over the middle of a long bridge it was going crazy telling me to Turn On Broadway.. I ran an OS upgrade from Garmin's website... didn't help. Oh yes, routes suck. Takes forever and a day to find search results, and sometimes you wait forever and it finds nothing.. The lack of a qwerty kbd layout on the touchscreen is pretty lousy.. You can better get where you are going by following the stars on a cloudy night than use this hunk of crap.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice size screen for easy viewing. 
Cons:. It will take you 1 to loaction and different way to go back to where you started from. It will take 1 way to get to SFO airport from Santa Rosa &#38; a different way to get back to Santa Rosa from SFO airport. Same thing to &#38; from Oakland airport.. 
Summary:. You have to click on "points of interest" to get to "lodging" icon, then it will ONLY show you everything in area y0ou are at and not let you choose from hotels, motels, camp grounds, rv parks, etc.Tech support said the management decided it wasn't necessary for people to chose what they are looking for,. Food or Shopping Icons give you choses of types of foods resturants as shoping gives you choses fo tyoes of stores &#38; shopping centers, but no choses for Lodging!. It gets lost! It has me drive in circles &#38; it can;t find the adress we are going to. It is for fasted time and ti takes the longest route that has the most stop lights.. 

$$;
Pros:. Multi Routing, Where Am I, Where do I Park,. 
Cons:. POOR Signal in certain cities.. 
Summary:. I love Garmin, I have used 300 and 400 series before I decided to go and buy Nuvi 750. I thought it was pretty cool to get rid of those flip up antenna. I was also interested with the better software features such as "multiple routing(Plan Ahead) and Where am I?" I used this GPS in few countries and few cities by now.. I would say Nuvi 750 HAS GOT THE WORST SIGNAL RECEIVER out of all other Garmin models I have tried. Don't get me wrong. When I was in California and Nevada for a few weeks, I thought the signal Nuvi 750 was marvelous. I was able to lock into the satellite fairly quickly within minutes. But the minute I drove to downtown LA, I started to experience signal problem.. I also felt the problem was growing when I was driving in Montreal Canada. It took almost 15minutes to lock into the satellite in the car. But The worst was when I took this Nuvi 750 to Jakarta, Indonesia which considered to be a very crowded, polluted, and heavy traffic with high building city. I WAS IN MADNESS. In LA, it took me only a few minutes to lock into the satellite, but in Jakarta especially when I was inside a moving car, I couldn't lock in at all, even after � hour of placing Nuvi 750 on the dashboard. Once, I got the signal locked in, I still experienced a lot of "loss satellite reception" problem.. I didn't experience this problem with previous Nuvi models with flipped up antenna.. The Good News is: The problem could be rectified COMPLETELY by buying GA25 MCX Garmin external antenna. It's such an exceptional antenna for the price. Now, I could even get signal with Nuvi 750 in the building, Jakarta, Indonesia.. Honestly, if you live in the city, it's very hard for me to recommend Nuvi 750. Better get 600 series. I'm not sure if 800 series has the same problem. Signal is a very IMPORTANT part of GPS. Without signal, no matter how good the features your GPS have, you won't be able to use it at all.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright, Nice View. 
Cons:. Bad routing, poor signal, slow to give direction. 

$$;
Pros:. some very nice software features only found on much more exopensive models/brands. 
Cons:. extremely poor reception and very slow processing...... 
Summary:. pass this one over....... 

$$;
Pros:. nice screen - nice functions. 
Cons:. If I'm paying this much for a GPS unit and can not use it without an external antenna, I guess it should come with one. JUNK. 
Summary:. i tried it yesterday for the first time. it took me 20 min to get a signal in a wide open parking lot with no tall buildings or trees. I have not had a signal since. It's on it's way back to the store.. 

$$;
Pros:. Came with a cigarette lighter plug. 
Cons:. Quit on the third long trip.. 
Summary:. In point six miles, turn left.. What if there are two streets right around the point six mile mark, and you are in traffic such that you can't see which street the little arrow is pointing at? Happened to me enough to hear the "Recalculating" message all too frequently.. I stopped for coffee and it gave me the choice to stay on, shut off now, or shut off in some number of seconds. I'd always shut it off manually, but decided to let it shut itself off that time.. It has never functioned again.. It's going back in the box and back to the store.. Taiwanese knock-off of ingenious American technology.. 

$$;
Pros:. no pros that i can see!!. 
Cons:. maps are wrong, will get you lost. battery dosent last any 5 hours, lost the voice already, maps are very slow to come up more you use it longet it takes. 
Summary:. dont waste your money on thisI have had this a year and not used it all that much when i did the maps were so wrong and already the voice had gone in it. Talked to a man at the electronic store and he said the same thing happened to his.. Called Carmin they said they would call me back that was a month ago, nothing yet. It got me lost for over 2 hours had to ask directions to get back home. Every time I use it takes longer to get the maps up on it just a headache. 

$$;
Pros:. cheep junk you get what you pay for. 
Cons:. junk,wast of money. 
Summary:. shopping for tom tom. 

$$;
Pros:. good display,easy menu system. 
Cons:. bad signal acquisition,fm transmitter too noisy, poor voice clarity,takes to long load from switch on. 
Summary:. does not pass the basic gps test. does not acquire signals quickly enough even in unobstructed view. had gone to phoenix could not load my location. kept saying acquiring signal. reached my destination with map. returned it to costco. bought it for $200.
