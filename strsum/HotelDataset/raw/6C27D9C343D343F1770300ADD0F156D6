i booked the castle hilton as part of a birthday trip for my wife but our reservation was not honoured so we ended up ( reluctantly ) at the westend hilton .
i was n't happy with the service at the castle hilton and when i mentioned this to the manager at the westend hilton he called the castle hilton and worked out an agreement to pay for our breakfasts as a gesture to make up for our reservation at the castle hilton not being honoured .
when we returned home on our first night we found the staff had left a card , bottle of champagne and two pieces of birthday cake in our room for my wife 's birthday .
it was a really nice gesture that helped rectify what had not been a good start to our trip .
the hotel was very clean and our room was well stocked with high quality shower items and had a good view of an ice rink behind the hotel .
although originally disappointed we were n't located in the castle district , the westend was very close to the metro line so convenient to get around to sites on the pest side .
the breakfast spread was tasty and there was a lot to choose from .
i certainly looked forward to breakfast !
ca n't rate the value of the hotel as i 'm not sure how much our room cost - it was upgraded when we checked in .
i 'm sure it was n't cheap , but . . .
