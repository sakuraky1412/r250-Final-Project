of course if you are not around during that time it should n't be an issue but if you plan on relaxing and working at the hotel you find it a bit difficult right now .
the only negative to this spot right now is that during our stay and continuing on this week and beyond they are doing mass contraction to the hotel which means that there is a lot of noise between roughly 8am - 4pm during the week .

the location was the best part as you are 5 -10 min walk to the shore walk with stunning views of the opera house and downtown skyline , 15 min walk to milson 's point ferry and luna park , 10-15 min walk to the milson 's point train station , 10-15 min walk to the stairs leading up to the harbour bridge ( by the train station ) , less than 10 minutes to get to restaurants and shops .
