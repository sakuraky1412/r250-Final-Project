Good but pricey food, great breakfast .
In any case, I had allotted approximately $150 for “food” for 4 days 3 nights .
Ed Debevics is fun, , sassy servers, diner food, total check about $30 for all four of us .
Staying with food, try also the Weber Grill, N .
The hotel buffet had fabulous food .
As far as food, walk a few blocks toward Michigan Ave turn left or right and there are plently of less expensive places to eat .
The Italian food was superb .
No line, a plate full of REAL food with drink included for $7 each .
Food unexceptional although the breakfast buffet in the basement restaurant   was of good quality .
A nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food .
