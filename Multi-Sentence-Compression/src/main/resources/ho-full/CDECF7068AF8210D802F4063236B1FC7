this hotel is part of the m gallery of accor and it has a distinctive design , being built anew inside what seems to be a previously industrial type building .
the result is great , brand new with character .
how to get there from the airport : - i reserved their boat shuttle which leaves from pier a/b in the taxi boat area of marco polo airport .
unfortunately my flight was late so i waited around and luckily another shuttle came after an hour .
but you need to reserve a specific time and the shuttle has no regular schedule .
much simpler is to take the public transportation shuttle servive , this is the seasonal line red of alilaguna lines for 9 eur one way ; get the schedule on the web site ( it does not run year long ) and get off at stop museo which is literally in front of the hotel ; this is the first stop from the airport .
you can also take more boats from there to go everywhere in venice with this public service .
the room : - i was upgraded to a room on two levels , very nice , absolutly quiet , very clean and nice furniture in brown tones ; - efficient a/c ; - free wifi ; - very nice and polite service at check in .
i would give this stay 5 stars except that the breakfast was ok but nothing more and i could not get the tv to work . . .
( obviously had i stayed . . .

( obviously had i stayed more than one night surely i would have had it fixed ) .
and last but not least , the rate was very reasonable !
