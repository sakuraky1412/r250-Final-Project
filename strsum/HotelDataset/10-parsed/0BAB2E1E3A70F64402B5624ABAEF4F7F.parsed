the/DT shower/NN curtain/NN was/VBD long/RB enough/RB so/IN that/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT bathroom/NN did/VBD not/RB flood/NN ,/, the/DT towel/NN rack/NN and/CC toilet/NN paper/NN holder/NN were/VBD still/RB in/IN place/NN ,/, and/CC there/EX was/VBD a/DT chair/NN ./.

there/EX was/VBD no/DT chair/NN ,/, like/IN in/IN the/DT pictures/NNS ,/, and/CC both/CC the/DT towel/NN rack/NN and/CC toilet/NN roll/NN holder/NN were/VBD missing/VBG -LRB-/-LRB- though/IN the/DT metal/NN connectors/NNS that/WDT used/VBD to/TO attach/VB them/PRP to/TO the/DT wall/NN were/VBD still/RB in/IN place/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

though/RB ,/, we/PRP asked/VBD for/IN recommendations/NNS for/IN dinner/NN and/CC were/VBD told/VBN to/TO just/RB ``/`` walk/VBP around/RB ''/'' and/CC we/PRP 'd/MD find/VB something/NN -LRB-/-LRB- this/DT is/VBZ in/IN an/DT area/NN of/IN town/NN where/WRB you/PRP do/VBP not/RB want/VB to/TO walk/VB around/IN exploring/VBG at/IN night/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

there/EX is/VBZ a/DT 3-4/CD ''/'' tall/JJ lip/NN for/IN the/DT shower/NN ,/, but/CC gallons/NNS of/IN water/NN end/VB up/RP in/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT bathroom/NN because/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT 2-3/CD ''/'' gap/NN between/IN the/DT lip/NN of/IN the/DT shower/NN and/CC the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT shower/NN curtain/NN ./.

if/IN we/PRP had/VBD been/VBN given/VBN room/NN 212/CD at/IN the/DT beginning/NN ,/, my/PRP$ review/NN would/MD probably/RB more/RBR favorable/JJ ,/, but/CC our/PRP$ experience/NN the/DT first/JJ night/NN soured/VBD us/PRP on/IN this/DT hotel/NN ./.

we/PRP slept/VBD much/RB better/JJR the/DT second/JJ night/NN ,/, mainly/RB because/IN we/PRP were/VBD on/IN the/DT other/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT hotel/NN ./.

if/IN you/PRP get/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT ``/`` better/JJR ''/'' rooms/NNS at/IN this/DT hotel/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT ok/NN place/NN to/TO stay/VB ./.

the/DT first/JJ room/NN we/PRP were/VBD given/VBN ,/, room/NN 202/CD was/VBD very/RB worn/JJ ./.
