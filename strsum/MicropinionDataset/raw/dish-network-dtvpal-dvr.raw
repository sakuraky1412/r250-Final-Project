Pros:. East to read menus onscreen. Unit is fast and responsive. Operation is dead simple. Great antenna reception.. 
Cons:. Not "name based". If a show changes times you miss it.. Not "Energy Star" qualified -- sucks 22 Watts of electricity 24/7.. No streaming NetFlix, though unit could do it with a software upgrade.. 
Summary:. The logical upgrade to a DTV converter box.. 

$$;
Pros:. After a bumpy start, this DVR (with the latest F208 firmware update) has become a real pleasure to have. I now find it user friendly and reliable. The picture quality is excellent; can't tell the difference between a live show and a recorded one.. 
Cons:. Limited to over-the-air broadcasts only; not for cable or satellite TV. The quality of the program guide is dependent on the individual TV station(s), or TVGOS if it is available in your city. Not as good as Tivo's guide, but it's fee and ad free!. 
Summary:. If you want something the replace your old analog VCR, or want a DVR similar to a Tivo, but less costly (and more limited), this Echostar (Dish) DtvPal DVR is well worth a look. I've had mine for several months and couldn't be happier since upgrading the firmware from F206 to F208, a very easy internet download. An excellent compresensive pros/cons summary of this DVR is available at the AV Science Forum site (avsforum) under the HDTV Recorders section, first post of the The Official AVS Dish DTVPal DVR Topic. There is nothing I can add to the information there. But, I can say that I am extremely pleased with my unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up. Only took about a few minutes and I was recording. Upgradable hard drive. Uses PSIP for program guide. DON'T NEED TVGOS. Dual tuners. Record two things at the same time.. 
Cons:. Not really a problem for me but I wonder why they didn't make it at least cable ready. Maybe because it's made by Dish Network. That might explain that.. 
Summary:. I needed a DVR that didn't really need the TVGOS to set the time and date and record on time. There is no TVGOS available where I live. PSIP does the job. I only get about 24 hours of guide but I don't care. Dual tuners allowed me to record two things at the same time. I get everything OTA. It would have been nice if it would have been able to handle cable tv but that would have only tempted me to order cable and I don't want to do that. The idea of FREE TV is what it's all about and I get over 20 channels OTA and that's all I need. I could get more if I want to rotate the antenna. I have the latest firmware and have had no problems. Great box for us who are simple and don't want to pay for TV. $250 is half the price of my first VCR. Yeah, I'm that old. Had black and white TV too. Had to get up to change the channel. ENOUGH. Oh yeah, after the 90 day warranty, I'll open it up and put in a bigger hard drive for less than $100. That's a big plus with this box.. 

$$;
Pros:. - No monthly fees. - Easy set up. - I get all local channels in digital + HD. - DVR is great. - F207 code running well. - No monthly fees. 
Cons:. - On screen guide pretty basic and has no video when active. - Some extended information not available in guide which should be the via TVGOS. 
Summary:. This unit got a bad wrap from early adopters probably because it was released before the code was stable. I have had no issues with the F207 code. This is a great way to reduce monthly TV fees to zero. Think about it.... - Fee based TV prices are higher than ever. - Every dollar counts more than ever. - The digital cut over is complete. - Alternative mediums on internet are increasingly available.. - Without 200 channels of reality shows to flip through, we may actually start reading books again.. ... nuff said..

Pros:. 2 tuners.. HDTV.. 
Cons:. Less than friendly user interface.. Does crash occasionally.. 
Summary:. I'd been waiting for this product for a couple of years before it was finally announced at last years CES show. I don't mean this specific product, but I mean a 2 tuner over the air HDTV DVR from ANY manufacturer. I had been using the Sony DHG-HDD250 for a few years. It only had one tuner though, and it may or may not continue to receive the TV Guide after they shut down analog TV (There is a workaround for that, with a $40 set top box to convert the digital signal back to analog to carry the TV Guide signal to the Sony box). So I'd been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this product for quite some time. I'm still puzzled by the fact that there haven't been more manufacturers come out with a similar product. I mean, a BETTER HDTV experience than you can get from the compressed HD satellite signal, and for free! I'd think consumers would be clamoring for this, especially in today's economy. I blow plenty of money on plenty of stupid things, but I'll never understand why anyone would spend $40 - $80 (or more) per month on TV, only to get an inferior picture to what I'm getting for free on my DTVPal DVR.. Yes, this thing does crash every now and then. I've used it fairly heavily for almost 2 1/2 months now, and it has probably reset at random moments about 4 or 5 times during the time I've owned it. It has also froze up maybe 2 times, when it seemed that my only option was to unplug it and plug it back in. It's definitely done that once, maybe twice.. So, how can I give it 5 stars? Well, you have to understand that I'm rebounding from a love/hate relationship with a Sony DHG-HDD250. It only had one tuner, the DTVPal DVR has two. The Sony crashed routinely, losing it's time of day settings nearly every time it did. That would obviously screw up my programmed recordings. It would usually take from 1 to 3 days before it would get itself back on the right time, and there was no way to manually set it. The DTVPal DVR, while it does occasionally and randomly reset, has never failed to come back on with the proper time setting intact. So the only impact it has when it resets is that I lose a minute or so of whatever it was recording. It picks up and starts recording again where it left off, and there will just be two segments in my list of recordings instead of one complete show. No big deal compared to what I'm coming from.. Other reasons I give it a 5.... It's the worst one of its kind. It's the best one of its kind. It's the only one of its kind.. If you're looking for a 2 tuner DVR that will allow you to record Heroes and 24 in High Definition at the same time via free broadcast TV from your rooftop antenna, while watching The Simpsons that you recorded the night before, then it's this or nothing. So it gets 5 stars by default. Maybe that is the equivalent of the bobsled team from Jamaica winning the Olympics because no other country fielded a team, I don't know. I just know that I've been yearning for a product with the specs that this one has for a long time, so I'm happy with it even if it does come with a few quirks.. 

$$;
Pros:. Record two shows at once. Easy to program, simple interface. Incredibly fast (360x) fast -forward or lower, makes checking programs a snap.. 
Cons:. No input to box to use for recording other things like from a security camera, VCR or DVD player. I bought it because I thought I could also use it for my security camera.. 
Summary:. I understand that it does not match up to the Tivo that you have to pay $400 for a lifetime membership for or $13/month. But are we really comparing apples and apples or apples and oranges. I think they are different beasts and overall the DTV Pal DVR is a great value for the money. I live in Los Angeles and get around 48 channels over the air and I don't want to pay monthly for cable for the rest of my life. That really adds up at say $50/month ($600/yr), year-after-year! I've had my box for about 6 months, I think and I have saved the cost of the box itself. So at least to me, there is no deal like this. On the other hand if you don't mind paying $13/month for the basic fee to Tivo, then maybe this is not for you. That adds up too. If you live in an area where there are lots of free channels, you can't go wrong with this.. Here are some Pros that there was no room to enter above:. The commercial skip (yellow) button on the remote makes it a breeze to skip over commercials. I absolutely LOVE this feature. It's worth the price of the box alone to be able to watch any show and skip over all commercials (albeit one at a time).. Here are some CONS, that there was no room to post above:. No input to box to use for recording other things like from a security camera, VCR or DVD player. I bought it because I thought I could also use it for my security camera and that would save me about $400, but I later found out that it doesn't have the capability.. The online menu doesn't show the details for most of the shows where I live, and I live in LA, so you would think we would have the best. I have it set to the right zip code, because if you don't set that properly, you'll get no menu details at all.. I did have the problem with the box shutting down by itself in the middle of programs that some other people complained about, but I fixed the problem by updating to the latest firmware and changing some settings in the setup. I had the wrong zip code programmed in it. I actually had my 'correct' zip code for where I live, but the DTV Pal DVR box doesn't want that. It says in the manual that if you live in Los Angeles, you need to use zip code 00002, which is strange since its not my real zip code. I think they should call it a city code or something, to avoid confusion, because anybody would think it actually means their own zip code. I actually suffered and cussed out the box for about 6 weeks before I simiply sat down one day and researched all I could on the box and found out about all of the people having problems too and finally found the solution in some forum somewhere. Now, I'm very happy with the box. But I agree 100% with the other reviewers that say the customer service is HORRIBLE. I called them about my problem and they had no solutions at all. I had to do it on my own.. The only real complaint that I have other than that is that the channel selection menu works too slow. I want to be able to pull up the menu and scroll quickly, but it is a somewhat slow process that I have not yet found a solution to other than simply going to tvguide.com and looking up my programs there instead of the DTV Pal DVR menu, because its more complete and faster.. FINAL SUMMARY. I still rate the product a 4.5 out of 5 stars despite all of the problems I have had, for the simple fact that there are no truly direct competitors on the market for this product and for the additional simple fact that all of the problems that I have had have been solved or have a workaround, like just using the Internet with my computer to look up shows quickly, rather than rely on the poor menu on the TV Pal DVR box.. 

$$;
Pros:. This thing has been such a nightmare but now with the 206 Firmware it seems stable. And provided it stays that way this DVR is a STEAL!!!. Two tuners-Yay!. 
Cons:. It took Dish Network wayyyy too long to make this right and their customer support is more than lacking.. Also the recording is timer based not name based and that is a big bummer.. 
Summary:. Still for the money and it looks like it's finally a stable product, this unit is a no brainer for folks that do not subscribe to cable or sat, and I have purchased two of them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice OTA DVR without subscription fee. High Definition recording and playback. Record 2 shows at once, pause live TV, etc....just like a DVR should. Good picture qualify and tuner reception.. 
Cons:. Occasional reboots (3 times in 7 weeks so far).. 
Summary:. I've really enjoyed this product alot. I've never had a DVR before so I guess I'm easily pleased. I enjoy having the capability of pausing live TV, recording 2 TV shows at the same time or watching one show and recording another at the same time. Another thing I've done alot is record 2 TV shows and watch a 3rd on my HDTV through it's own tuner. My DTVPal DVR has rebooted 3 times in 7 weeks. Actually it rebooted 2 times in the 1st 2 days and only 1 time in the following 6 1/2 weeks, so I guess I'm one of the lucky people who got a DTVPal DVR that doesn't have the constant reboot or freeze up problems that other people have reported. I don't have to pay a monthly fee like I would if I had the TIVO OTA HD DVR which is a definite plus. I've read that the DTVPal DVR is not as fancy as other DVR's but that is not really a big issue for me since I was mainly a VCR user before this....so this DVR is great for me. I've enjoyed it alot!. Anyway, if you're lucky to get one that doesn't have the reboot or freeze up issues, then it's a great product. Hopefully Dish Network will eventually fix those problems and put out a more stable product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up in minutes. (anyone could do it). Good digital tuner that picks up all the stations.. 7 day Program guide. And yes HD recording over 30 hours. No monthly fees in any way. Its all free after you buy the box.. Box stays very very cool !. 
Cons:. No video in the corner of the Guide like other dish network boxes, like the 622 or 722.. The box is not flat on top so no clean stacking other things on top.. There is a card for the box, that sticks out in front. :(. 
Summary:. The Dish Network "DTVPal DVR" is well worth the money. You can buy this one time and never pay anyone again for HDTV over local channels. You can set it up to record a show every week a lot like the old VCR's worked with ones a week at a given time, but much easier because all you have to do is push the Record button for what you are watching or something on the guide. You can also rewind what you are watching and record if from the time you first started watching that channel like other dish boxes.. The seven day program guide is great but no video of current show in the corner like the other dish boxes like the 622 or 722. I hope this will be upgraded with updates but no word on that. But the work around for that is push the Browse button and see one channel guide at the bottom of your show wile watching and go see the guide at the bottom of the picture.. You can Pause, Stop, Fast forward or rewind (at 4 different speeds 4x 15x 60x &#38; 300x), slow motion-forward or reverse ( 1/15 or 1/4 speed) when in live mode or DVR but not wile recording a given show (have to go into the DVR to do that on recorded shows). The step forward or reverse works too but not so good.. OK this one should be on the Pros list but no room. This box has 2 tuners so you can record one or two shows at the same time. You can then watch either one of the two recording shows live (Stop,Rewind, Skip ect.. will not work unless you watch the same show in the recorded show on the DVR) or watch a old recorded show wile the two new shows record.. Another great feature is you can Skip forward (30 seconds) or Skip back (10 seconds) at any time other than during a recording. (like I said above, just watch the same show in the recording wile is records so all the ******** work like Pause). I is not like that on other dish boxes but it works.. I did do a firmware update from F201 to F202 and when the update should have finnished the box locked up. I waited about a hour and unplugged the box and when I plugged it back in it finnished the update. I didn't see any change with the update. I used the Ethernet connection for the update and it worked good.. OK the last thing is this box is not even warm when running for hours so why did they make it not so good to stack other thing on top? (you can do it but front is lower than the back and a little rounded on top).. I like to point out thing but this really is a great box for what it is and I would buy it again.. 

$$;
Pros:. No subscription. Superb video quality. Dual Tuners. HDTV tuner for older HD tvs that didn't come with an ATSC tuner. Stable with the new firmware. Future Updates. Optical Digital Sound. New firmware allows buffer to be recorded as well.. 
Cons:. It is exactly what the review says it is. It is much more like a fancy VCR than a current DVR. Was extremely buggy at first with F202 firmware. Short warranty and no return policy. No name based recording.. 
Summary:. I preordered my DTVPal DVR because I didn't want to purchase a Dish service and I didn't want to pay a subscription fee to Tivo. I have always only used free Over The Air TV signals.. My area went Digital Only in August 2008. Our transmitters are in the mountains and they couldn't be worked on in the Winter, so we changed early to meet the deadline. Then the government extended the deadline. I'm sorry that they did. Going digital has been amazing around here! I used to get a pretty good signal, but usually received a little bit of fuzz in the sound and picture. With digital I have a constant 85% signal strength which allows for perfect picture and sound.. So I thought a DVR would be really nice. Then the DTVpal showed up. I was very excited only to find that it would constantly power cycle about 2-3 times an hour whether I was watching live TV or a recording. The recordings sucked because many shows were broken up in to 20 minute segments with the remainder as a different segment with 2-3 minutes missing as the unit rebooted. That was with updates F201 which was my original and also with F202. I was irritated, but had faith Echostar would fix it. They finally did with the F206 firmware. It works perfectly now and is very stable. It hasn't power cycled since the new firmware. F206 is a must have update. Finally it has added the ability to also record the buffer when the recording button is used in the middle of a program.. Great Improvements!. Still it isn't a Tivo, but if you want less expensive then this is definitely a smart way to go. Oh and who knows what future upgrades might bring to the device!. 

$$;
Pros:. Terrific recording quality. Easy to use. No fees. Very sensitive tuners. Can install a larger HDD (up to 500 gig) according to blogs.. 
Cons:. Should have been tested more before being released...the latest firmware update of F206 has resolved almost all of the issues reported in the other reviews.. 
Summary:. These DVRs are now available again at www.DTVPAL.com Don't be afraid to try one!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, TV guide on screen (where available), ease of use. dual tuner. HD. 
Cons:. Can be buggy at times. 
Summary:. i have had the unit for a month and love it so far. I used to use a panasonic dvd recorder and its no comparison. This rivals the dvrs from cable co.. 

$$;
Pros:. OTA HD dvr capability (up to 1080i). Hard drive can unofficially be upgraded to 500gb. Dual tuners. No subscription needed. Enables trickplays such as pausing and rewinding live TV. Great program guide. 
Cons:. No name-based recording/ "season passes". Software is a bit buggy - crashes occasionally, but nothing I cannot live with. Dish customer service. No removable storage. 
Summary:. This is an excellent buy for the $$$ and is currently the only model of its kind (offering dual tuner OTA HD dvr capability without a subscription). I have been very pleased with its performance thus far. The tuners are great - they are better than the one that came in my TV and my reception is significantly better. I am not a big TV watcher, so it is nice to be able to watch something that I actually enjoy in the few times a week I have a chance to sit down. Also nice to keep some programs for the kids. The "pause" is a good feature if you have kids, so that when you need to go upstairs for the 10th glass of water, you will not miss the last 5 minutes of your show. Sure, there are a few bugs that will hopefully be worked out with additional software upgrades (the unit can be upgraded via an ethernet connection), but the functionality is acceptable, especially considering the price. I have not swapped out my hardrive at this time, but I understand that it is possible -- it requires opening up the box (so do at your own risk!). I should note that I live in a digital TVGOS service area - the guide feature is probably not as great for those that do not. Are there features that a $700 box has that this does not? Of course. But it is a great piece of equipment for the money.. (I do need to agree with another poster that Dish customer service is pretty atrocious - they really need to at least implement some sort of an order tracking system and get some customer service reps who even know what the product is. Thankfully, I have not had to deal with tech support, so I cannot speak for whether they are more helpful.). 

$$;
Pros:. I like how it operates for the price.. 
Cons:. Customer Service is horrible and watch out, they do not include sales tax. You get a bill for that after you have already purchased the system. I still wish Panasonic would get back into the DVR market with the TVGOS system again.. 
Summary:. If you are looking for an affordable DVR and do not want to pay a monthly fee, this is basically your only choice. It so far works fine in my home. Just watch out for Customer Service.. 

$$;
Pros:. no monthly fees, great picture and audio, simultaneous HDMI and component video output, price. 
Cons:. customer support, firmware, product reliability, user manual, TVGOS coverage.. 
Summary:. I like this DVR, but I really wanted to love it. Its shortcomings make this impossible. I bought this after reading other people's frustrations with it. I don't regret buying it though since it's still way better than recording on a VCR!. First problem - when I bought it, there's no confirmation email, no tracking number, no nothing (an appropriate introduction to Dish's customer service culture). Actually I wasn't even sure I'd bought it until it showed up on my doorstep.. It was easy enough to set up. When I did a channel scan, it failed to lock a channel with 90% signal, and I couldn't manually add it either. A second rescan fix it though. My firmware problems get worse from there.. The first time I tried to record 2 programs at once was a nightmare. One program was split in two pieces, the other was saved with no details. I then upgraded the firmware to F202. That seemed to fix the two pieces problem, but not the no details problem. It seems to have introduced the worst problem so far - freeze ups!. I simply can't watch live tv on one channel and record on another without it freezing up at some point. When it freezes up, the only recourse is to unplug it and start over. This isn't very convenient when I'm watching it over my slingbox (ironically, marketed by another Echostar company).. And can I find anyone to contact at Dish about this? I can only send them an email, no phone number! The user manual was written like it was expected that people would toss it out. There are tons of things not even covered, like what's with the card inserted in the front of it?. TVGOS is another hedache. It does make reording easier, but only 10 of 25 channels I get have information. The other 15 are such a pain I don't even bother to record anything on them.. I want to end on a positive note though. The stuff I've recorded and watched later is excellent. I love the ability to watch a 1 hour show in 45 minutes without quality degradation. If only it came with a larger hard drive ..... 

$$;
Pros:. No Monthly fee. Great picture quality.. 
Cons:. Forgets to record shows I tell it to. Buggy, very buggy.. 
Summary:. I bought this because I was sick of paying for Comcast every month. With a DVR I can record more than enough shows from broadcast networks to watch throughout the day. I bought this unit over a Tivo because it requires no monthly fee. The picture quality of the unit is excellent. HD looks better on this that it did with Comcast. I like the 30 second commercial skip button that the remote has as well.. Now to the bad. It's kinda buggy. I had to unplug the ethernet cable, because after I had it for a few months, it started to always say ethernet connection detected, then ethernet connection not detected all the time when I was watching tv. Worse than that though is if you tell it to record a specific time every week, sometimes it remembers to keep taping the same thing every week, sometimes it totally forgets to record it, and more odd is sometimes it will record the channel you want for the amount of time you want, just at a way different time. Like maybe 4 hours earlier or something. So to get around that, you have to go to the guide every morning to record your shows for the day. I usually only record shows in prime time though, and unfortunately the guide usually only shows about 8 hours ahead of time, so I have to wait til the afternoon to tell it to record, and sometimes I'm not home, so I can't. That's the worst part about the unit.. Overall, I probably wouldn't have bought this unit again. It's nice for the small form factor, and nice remote, but I could have bought a PC with a video tuner card to use as a DVR for about the same price, and gotten the use of a whole computer plus tv on my television, rather than just a dvr.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good converter, easily programmed. 
Cons:. Periodic glitches, Broke four days after end of 3 month warranty, Customer service difficult and time consuming to work with, No repair services available for this product. If it breaks after 3 months, there's nothing you can do.. 
Summary:. For the three months and four days my DTVPal Converter worked, I was very happy. It easily recorded the programs I wanted, and although there were a few glitches here and there, they weren't anything I couldn't deal with. One day while watching TV, the screen turned to snow. I contacted Dish Network's technical support, and they told me that the unit is broken and unrepairable, and there is nothing further they can do to help me. Luckily, the credit card that I used to purchase this item will double it's warranty period and refund my $250. In order to complete my claim, I need to provide a repair invoice, along with other documention. Unfortunately, Dish Network is unwilling to provide me with a repair invoice or written statement stating that my unit is unrepairable, they also have no authorized repair shops, and all their local retailers do not provide technical servicing. Although I enjoyed this product while it lasted, I won't be replacing my unit with another Dish Network product, as I now lack confidence in a company that not only doesn't seem to care about customer satisfaction but also only offers a three-month warranty on its product.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it actually records what I program it to, it works great. Allows you to program 2 shows to record at the same time, updates the TV guide, lots of hard drive space available.. 
Cons:. It likes to skip programs for no reason, delete programs that I don't want deleted, it randomly turns off while watching a show. For daylight savings time, the timers on all my programs also changed which meant they were all at the wrong time!. 
Summary:. The overall unit is a great idea, the problem is the support from Dish is horrible. If you go to their tech support, it tells you to unplug the unit for almost every problem and that does NOT solve anything. They need to figure out how to make this unit more reliable and record programs as scheduled. Tech support responds to my emails, but with no solution for any of the problems that I have.. 

$$;
Pros:. - HD recording and playback - Very sharp images. - Easy to use once you get used to the menu setup. - Setup is so easy. - No more DVDs lying all over the place. 
Cons:. - Customer service people read from a script and know nothing about the unit. - You must demand to speak to tech support to get anything fixed.. - Device re-boots in the middle of watching a recording. - Device automatically deletes all timer settings. 
Summary:. There are so many problems with this unit that I do not know where to start.. To begin with, this device is NOT ready for prime time. Too many bugs and no one that knows how to fix them. Here is a list of all the problems I've experienced and you too will if you purchase this device:. 1. Unit freezes. 2. Device re-boots while watching a recording. 3. Device will delete ALL of your timer settings EVERY TIME! I can no longer record anything because of this.. 4. Customizing the receiver is easy if it only kept the settings.. 5. TV Guide can only display less that 12 hours in advance - another problem or could this be a design feature? I hope not.. 6. Setup Menu thus far has worked well, allowing me to change things on the fly and access the digital video recording features - so far anyways!. Bottom line: Really nice recorder if it only worked as advertised. Mine is going back for a new one because tech support could not figure out what was wrong with my device. I am hoping that the new one works better (Please God!).. Too bad about all these problems because when it works right it is a great recorder!. 

$$;
Pros:. The capability of the unit is very good. Reception is excellent Features are very good.. 
Cons:. The unit randomly locks up and reboots. Sometimes it requires removing the power from the unit to reboot it. This happens during simple viewing, recording, and watching a recording. I have called the company at least 8 times. No customer service.. 
Summary:. This is a great product but unfortunately is full of bugs. Customer service is vey poor. I have called half a dozen times. They promised to send a new unit by 2 day delivery on 28 December. It is now 24 January and no unit. Now they say I must return the unit first and have promised to send UPS labels which have not come either. I would like this unit to work properly as it has great potential.. 

$$;
Pros:. No monthly fees. 
Cons:. You name it. Reboots lock-ups and customer service is very bad.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing good about something that does not work after 9 months.. 
Cons:. it basically stopped working after 9 months and the support sucks..there is none! Freeze ups and now loading please wait error that won't go away!. 
Summary:. It is of poor craftsmen ship...don't buy it.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works, it's great.. 
Cons:. If the DVR fails, Dish Networks won't honor the 90 day warranty unless you purchased it through them, which you can't. That means there is no warranty. Trying to resolve warranty issues only results in promises with no action.. 
Summary:. If you want to roll the dice and hope you get a good one, you'll either be very happy or mad.. 

$$;
Pros:. when dvr works, it's great quality. 
Cons:. no support, no warranty, constantly reboots or freezes. 
Summary:. Not worth putting $300+ into. Dish Network no longer sells them, only Kmart. Features are lacking because system freezes or reboots erasing unprotected content constantly.. 

$$;
Pros:. We only had the unit for 3 months. Worked well till it died.. 
Cons:. It seemed to get stuck on Loading....please wait and we could no longer use it. We tried unplugging it, unhooking it and the whole nine yards.. 
Summary:. Seems a huge waste of 250.00 for it to only last a few months and we got no help from the company. No replacement, no repair. Just 250.00 out the window. I don't know about anyone else but we work too hard for what we have and can't afford things that cost this much and work such a short period of time. Times are too hard for this type of product and customer service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Little. 
Cons:. They have a policy of destroying your personal equipment if sent to them by mistake. They give NO notice by any means before robbing you of equipment and destroying it. They simply only apologize for "inconvenience" after a BBB complaint is filed.. 
Summary:. How could you trust such a company?. Once again Dish TERRIBLE Network has refused to replace or refund me for my equipment I sent to them in error. Despite my filing a Better Busines Bureau Complaint, they simply offer an apology for inconvenience. They took my personal property and destroyed it without any notification to me, in any form, by any route. I mistakenly sent my DVD recorder with a hard drive to them. It looked similar to the dish receiver I was returning to them and I just packed the wrong one. They were both out of my media tower, which I was rearranging after switching to DirecTV. They continue and adamantly refuse to compensate me or replace my DVD recorder with hard drive. They show a total disregard for other's personal property, yet would charge me without hesitation for keeping and destroying their property.. 

$$;
Pros:. no monthly fees. 
Cons:. Unit will crash while watching causing the recordings to become fragmented.. 
Summary:. good idea if Dish Network can get it to work. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works, it records two digital shows at a time and you can watch a prior recording at the same time. It's easy to pause or rewind live TV.. 
Cons:. Dish's customer service is extremely terrible. Machine is defective, maybe they all are. The 7 day guide is only filled in for 6-12 hours. It's not a satallite reciever, but has a satallite card which they used to deactive my unit &#38; kept my money. 
Summary:. Echostar/Dish DTVPal DVR compared with Philips DVDR3576H. I would giv it 3 out of five stars if it actually worked.. Let me first say, ?DON?T ORDER THE DTVPal DVR until they fix the problems?. I got a defective machine and after seven hours of phone calls and letter writing, they haven?t replaced it. I am now working with VISA and hope they will refund my money. Even though this machine was paid in full and was working over 90% of the time, DISH deactivated it over-the-air and it no longer works at all. I wonder is Dish is not replacing my unit because they know they will be replacing it with another defective unit because that?s all they have. They won?t refund my money either.. Dishes site compares their DVR to the VIP 622 and VIP 722 satellite receivers. If those are race horses, the DTVPal DVR is a pony at best.. I will use words Dish and Philips for the Dish DTVPal DVR and Philips DVDR3576H.. Both receive and record HD and standard digital broadcasts. Only the Philips receives and records analog.. The Dish has a slightly larger hard drive but you cannot change the recording qualities. My Dish DVR only records about 110 hours of standard TV even though it says 150 hours on the box. You can set the Philips DVDR to record 66 to 198 hours of standard TV depending on the quality you want. I set my Philips to 99 hours and it seems to have the same quality picture as the Dish unit.. The Dish DVR records two channels at a time, but it is tricky?you have to set the longer show before you set the shorter shows or it won?t record two at a time. The Philips will only record one show at a time. Both units will play back an existing recording while you are making a recording. Both will also play back a current recording while you are recording it. For example, you can start recording a three hour football game and start watching it an hour later and skip the commercials, time-outs etc. I usually start about two hours into a game and finish at the same time. I can even watch every play in less than 30 minutes with either machine.. The Philips let you watch DVD?s or record to writeable DVD?s as well as the hard drive. I connected my VCR to my Philips DVDR and I copy my tapes to the hard drive. Because the Philips machine has an editing feature, I then edit out items I don?t want and record it to a DVD. You can record one to six hours depending on the quality setting. The DVD?s menu then shows each recording, but it always shows one extra menu choice which is empty. It only records standard definition to a DVD disc. The Dish DVR will not record to DVD?s.. You can pause live TV on either machine, but the Philips does a poor job of this. It?s easier to just hit the hit the record button on the Philips machine. Just hit the pause or rewind or skip back buttons on the Dish DVR. It starts recording any show you watch and keeps an hour in memory if you don?t change channels. If you change channels, it starts over. This feature doesn?t work if you are recording two shows.. The Philips unit looks good, about an 8 or 9 out of 10. The Dish unit looks terrible, probably a 0 or 1 out of ten. It even has the DTVPal TV emblem painted permanently all over the top of the unit. The Dish unit even has a satellite card sticking out the front of it. They didn?t even put a door over it like on their satellite units. They evidently use this to disable your machine if they want to?they disabled mine. The Dish unit has no buttons on it, not even a power button. It is controlled entirely by the remote control. The Philips unit has a power, play, stop and eject button on it. (I don?t know why they need a card. Cards are used to control your particular unit, either to limit service or bill you.). The Dish DVR lets you edit out channels you don?t want including sub channels like 8.4. The Philips DVDR is all or nothing. You either keep all of channel 8 and its sub channels or you delete them all.. The Philips has a very low quality remote. I hope it lasts a year. I bought another. The quality of the Dish remote is much better, but it?s not excellent.. I have one of the older Mitsubishi rear projection TV?s and it only has one 1080i component input. It also has 480 component input. Although the standard TV images are similar for both units, I have only used the Dish on 1080i input. It has a very good image, but not excellent. My seven year old Direct TV HD receiver (use only for over-the-air TV) has a better image.. I will continue this review if they let me.. Updated. on Jan 12, 2009.
