now the problems , no lock on bathroom door - not ideal when two couples are renting , tumble drier did n't work - only found it out after the 2nd load of washing put on , only two towels provided for four people , internet connection not the best and it took many attempts to get it to work as cable broken and verbal instructions provided not clear .
on departure the next day , the same problem but this time a car park staff member , it is monday , helps and allows me out for $ 40 .
same procedure , this time i try the assistance button but that does n't result in anything except a request to get the hotel to ring .
i am advised to go to a different hotel on the car park 's street to sort it out but it is not clear what they will do .
getting in was fine and on departure , you take your ticket to reception to get a discount exit ticket .
however , we managed to get drier working by taking some clothes out , so obviously it has a weight problem !
oh , and the lights were all out when we returned after midnight after a visit to phillip island and the penguins .
the above said , it is a convenient and comfortable hotel in the central cbd .
receptionist comes with me with another 2nd ticket which also does n't work so he presses assistance button explains who he is and i am asked to put in $ 20 . success .
2nd night , return after midnight and try to move car at about 10pm the following night .
