voice activation did stop working & then came back in german ,  just changed it back english & has been working well since then .

voice commands were mechanical but clear .

the voices seem too robotic .

you have your choice of several languages and voices .

however, i much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .

from reviews, i thought there might only be one voice .

the text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .

0 out of 5 stars no jill voice on this one !

it seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .

some of the voices are annoying .
