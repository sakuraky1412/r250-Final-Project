i'm coming from an iphone 3gs  .

my dad (a seagate engineer and tech nerd) took the iphone and i got the nexus one  .

he's constantly feeling like i swindled him  .

the oled screen is gorgeous , the multitude of options it's just a great phone some people complain about the little ball (or phone   as i've heard it called) , but i love the ability to customize its color based on text vs email , etc i rooted it and installed the cyanogen mod and that added even more functionality (720p video recording back before froyo 2  .

2 ,  .

flac native support , etc  .

) this phone is just fantastic  .

but then again , it's android you should love  .

the aesthetic quality of this phone is merely its material form   )  .

i've been an android fan since day one , bought the g1 the first day , out of contract full price ; bought the nexus 1 first day full price and have never regretted either purchase  .

for those of us who dislike touchscreen only , this phone has been an absolute blast  .

it's a freakin speed demon , and despite being so old (9 months is an eternity) , it's still on par if not better than the other droids and the iphone  .

it's also so much more than a phone , it's a minicomputer , and in 10 minutes time with the help of the forums i went from zero programming tech skills to rooting and installing system apps , replacing the radio  .

the best part is , such tinkering while absolutely not required to have a great super zippy experience is not only allowed by encouraged  .

reminds me of the scion commercials , (except not a pos) , you can customize this phone any way you want  .

android already works like a computer allowing you to place shortcuts on a desktop , widgets alone beat ios's system , the power control widget that comes stock allows you to turn on wifi , bluetooth , gps , sync , and change brightness with literally one finger touch  .

plain vanilla android is the best because you get updates the quickest , and if you want a custom skin similar to htc's sense or motorola's motoblur , in five minutes you can find and install it  .

this phone's absolutely incredible , and i've yet to see anything that the iphone or any other droid have over it  .

except the stock keyboard , the iphone keyboard is still the best stock keyboard hands down , but in two minutes i installed swype and have been blowing tap to type phones out of the water  .

i still miss my 5 row keyboard , but the nexus one's screen has assuaged the homesickness a little  .

two lacking features , does not have forward facing camera , or an hdmi out  .

not deal breakers for me because no one uses facechatting anyways , and if i'm at home where my tv is , i'm connecting my laptop , not my phone  .

as mentioned before , if you're getting an android phone , this is the one to get , stock vanilla offers the most versatility and is quickest to get upgraded  .

here's to hoping google releases a nexus two at some point  .

best phone ever  .

the nexus one is definitely the best choice in phone that i could of made  .

i am a previous owner of the iphone 3gs and purchased the n1 in april  .

i knew that the iphone 4 is soon to be released but i is amazed by the package the 6    month old n1 came with  .

fast processor and beautiful screen  .

the full customization of this phone is something the iphone 3gs and the iphone 4 just cannot touch the browser experience is superb  .

for the n1 being released back in january , it is simply still neck and neck with phones being released present    day  .

the speeds and performance of the nexus one are amazing  .

with the recent update of froyo 2  .

2 , speeds have increased 450% from android 2  .

1 users do have issues with dust under the screen and software glitches  .

as i said before , i purchased my device in april and i haven't experienced any problem whatsoever  .

i have noticed the screen is not as scratch resistance as it may seem and is behind that of the iphone in this department  .

i have one scratch on my screen and nothing more  .

it is very resistant but to say the least , it is penetrable  .

final word   for $500+ this may not be the phone for many  .

it is sold unlocked and is still being sold unlocked as a developer phone  .

this means that you aren't able to upgrade phones ( unless t    mobile has something planned) therefore you are stuck with a high priced phone  .

it would not be a phone i'd purchase this very day  .

there are many phones that have just been released that equal to or are more impressive than the nexus one  .

the droid incredible would be my choice  .

however , i'm on at t and there is not much of a selection of android devices if you are with at t and want a powerful android device   get a nexus one  .

really awesome  .

i dont have words to describe .

with froyo on this phone , it's still one of the top smartphones on the market  .

the best thing is the stock android rom built in , very much the same android roms i installed on previous windows based htc phones that made me fall in love with the platform  .

i've seen the future , and it's name is android  .

i is a very heavy windows mobile user , constatly flashing newer roms on the phones , and never content with the closed apple system  .

this powerful android device takes one root and nothing else is necessary to customize , at least not at the risk of bricking my phone  .

i am even running the nexus version of froyo on a tilt 2 , a touch diamond , and an htc fuze .

i received my nexus one 8 days ago and could not be happier  .

this is my first android powered phone and i'm enjoying my time with it so far  .

a lot of people seem to be having problems with the phone and all i can say it's probably user error  .

learn to use your phone to it's full potential then write a review  .

you should have done research about the nexus one (and android) before you purchased it , especially if you are paying $529 bottom line   sexy , dependable and powerful nexus one is a phone for people who know better  .

i'd put my nexus one up against any apple ithing (i is an iphone loyalist for 2 years) any day  .

i give nexus one 5 stars because it allows me to manipulate it the way i want  .

android is the future .

i give it 5  because no other phone comes close to what nexus one delivers , but still there is room for a lot more , call me a demanding consumer i want direction on maps from where i point to my location  .

turn by turn direction should be also be available on bluetooth headset  .

infact they have probably forgotten how well the headset can be used with such a lovely device  .

hope they fix this in froyo ota  .

also i want to sync with multiple calenders , ims of gtalks basically different ids  .

not only mail but also picasa , gtalk , calender etc thats what it can achieve by simple tweaking and can be much better it does not mean that it is bad  .

the screen is just awesome , the touch is great  .

there were few instances when it is unresponsive but i am sure that has been fixed in froyo 2  .

the phone works great on wi    fi , 3g , edge , gprs  .

it is a whole phone unlike others , and best is you can do lot of things simultaneously  .

the media player is ok , and do not expect more from it either  .

videos are of very good quality and uploading to youtube works just great the app store has everything one can need , want or desire ofcourse the list for latter two is limitless overall this is a phone that is far ahead of its generation , there may be a better phone than this but not in the very near future .

android operating system is superior to blackberry os and windows mobile os  .

i have used both for many years  .

android is simpler and more powerful at the same time  .

with the next update , storing apps on memory card is possible 2  .

size of phone makes it easy to use  .

i use a hardshell case with it which i would recommend and a clear screen cover  .

screen is responsive and after a day with the phone , it is intuitive to navigate anywhere  .

bigger screen than iphone and slightly thinner than iphone 3  .

apps   the android market is growing and already has over 60 , 000 apps  .

the apps do not have the same restrictions as the iphone apps so you can pretty much do anything you want to your phone  .

use another browser or replace homescreen    no problem  .

can you do that with iphone  .

speed   fastest smarthphone on market with a 1ghz processor and great graphics  .

this thing is great for video or about anything you think you can put on it 5  .

camera 5megapixel and video   i use it all the time  .

in fact , i use it more often than my 12 megapixel nikon  .

great quality and flash works really well 6  .

call quality is great 7  .

battery life   works well most of day  .

i leave about 9and come home at 5  30  .

it last mosts of day  .

if i leave 3g active connection with voip and bluetooth on for car , it will go quicker but that is expected  .

i have car charger 8  .

bluetooth car connection   hooked it up in 60 seconds first time and it works like a charm  .

love this feature 9  .

screen   the screen clarity and brightness are great  .

if you are outside in direct sunlight  .

check the autobrightness setting and you will not have a problem  .

the graphics do look good and vivid  .

there are some arguments as to whether the screen technology is the best or not  .

but the nexu one's output looks comparable or better than any other phone i have seen on the market 10  .

expandability   sd card makes this a great expandable phone .

bottom line  .

with android 2  .

2 os , this kills the iphone .

the list of nexus one cans    the phone has a 1 ghz processor , 3  .

5g capability , is completely unlocked for ease of transfer , can handle the largest microsd cards available (comes with a 4gb card) , can store to external memory as of android os 2  .

2 , full multi    touch capability , can view video in hd quality , can sync with your calendars or outlook , can search anything (e  .

you contacts , the web , stored files , etc) either by voice or text through a unified and built in search engine , runs any application simultaneously with any other application , 5mp camera with a flash , screen is oled which saves on battery life , can provide built in usb tethering and wifi hotspot for other devices , can use wifi for sms or phone service thereby saving your minutes for when you are not at home , and all of this is run from an open source os that is installed on more phones than there is iphones the list of nexus one cannots    cannot be restricted to one service provider , cannot make your bed or prepare your breakfast (yet) really , i would enjoy finding an actual flaw with this device that cannot be reasonably attributed to the fact that we have not perfected 3d projection or nuclear powered phones .

i found no issues yet with my nexus one  .

love you google .

if you're reading this review to decide if you should spend the big money on this phone , i can only tell you i have been pleased with my purchase  .

i would do it again and i have no iphone envy as yet  .

voices are clear and the voice to text recognition is very cool  .

the phone's looks and feel are just smooth , that  .

s all i can say  .

the on    screen keyboard works great  .

i'm using at t service and side by side comparison shows my pages load slightly faster than an iphone 3gs  .

call volume is not super loud on the highest setting but it is not a problem .

i've owned the original iphone and the iphone 3gs before switching to the nexus one  .

i is a little hesitant to switch from the polished apple iphone 3gs to the google android nexus one  .

android is amazing though  .

widgets are the greatest os feature  .

also , the ability to add shortcuts on the homescreen is a huge time saver  .

i put direct dials to my contacts that i'm calling all the time  .

now i only have to push one button when i want to call them  .

android has come a long way over the past year  .

it's finally an solid os that can compete with apple head to head  .

i for one think that android is superior to apple right now , this is the best phone on the market .

outstanding phone , upgraded from a g1 , prior to that a wing  .

my girlfriends fingers don't seem to be as responsive on the touch screen as mine    so , i do not think it's necessarily the phones fault all in all , beautiful , beautiful phone  .

blazingly fast , great battery life , great camera , great user interface  .

and it will just keep getting better  .

i really hate to give it such a great review    i enjoy being the only guy on the block who has one  .

so , enjoy your iphone , suckers  .

it's a do it all pocket device  .

also unlocked , customizable , multitask , etc  .

i cannot say enough  .

love this phone  .

this phone has a lot of pros but very little cons  .

although i paid 530$ for it , i use my tmo g1's sim card so i only pay like 65$ (taxes included) a month for 400 mins , unlimited text , and unlimited data .

overall a great phone  .

will definitely recommend this .

it is a fast phone , with a big high resolution touch screen .

i researched this phone for quite a while before going with it , and i am not disappointed at all  .

i also switched from verizon to t    mobile  .

this is a leap of faith  .

i took a survey of my friends who had what service , and more than not i received better answers from t    mobile users , so i switched instead of waiting for verizon's version  .

i'm glad i did  .

much better reception and call quality (at least for me since location has a lot to do with it , and i'm in orlando , fl)  .

much cheaper plan  .

i had a 17% corporate discount with verizon , and if i stayed with them , i would have paid $20 more a mouth for the same plan and features , and that is with my discount  .

i have been using it all day everyday , and keep finding cool new features  .

i did use an iphone , and i hate comparing the two , but everyone does , so here is my comparison  .

pretty much even  .

n1 can multitask , and has a much better look and feel  .

call quality is better on n1 too  .

the screen size it a bit larger , but much better looking , and sharper  .

the bottom line for me is this phone rocks  .

do not think twice to buy it sight unseen online  .

you will not be disappointed .

the greatest phone i have ever owned  .

do not want an iphone you should get this  .

want to get an iphone  .

look at this as well  .

flash is nice but a little behind the internet's  .

i love the live desktop  .

did i mention slim and sexy like a supermodel updated  .

on may 23 , 2010  .

trust me dont compare with iphone , never used iphone so dont know it  .

this phone looks 100 times sexier than iphone , just hold this in your hand and feel  .

i took this to mall to get protector sheet  .

everyone is looking at this phone , made me feel very proud , this one is the best the good thing there is a solution to fix any issue you face in this phone , only thing you need to either discover or read online menu .

only people who spend all day worshiping the next new device will se major flaws  .

us regular folks think its great  .

got the droid last month , didn't like it , too bunky , i went from iphone to droid , so i wasnt used to it  .

but this nexus one , is for sure better than iphone in all the bad ways , and has all the features that iphone excelled at  .

give it a chance  .

you will like it  .

also you have to have the right apps for the phone  .

maybe that's why people do not understand it much  .

best phone ever , i used to have an iphone 3gs w att , it is the best phone 2 years ago , until iphone users abused the network , now it's one of the slowest speed ever  .

so i switched to nexus one  .

it has almost every good things that iphone has to offer , (along with other apps)  .

yet , replaces all the cons of an iphone  .

the ne    sayers are criticizing the phone , they are just haters , or they do not really know how to make the best use of the nexus one updated  .

on feb 8 , 2010  .

phone w/all you need in a smartphone  .

beats all of them hand down i have tried all smartphones this is the best thus far .

this phone is fast  .

you can run 10 different apps and switch between between them in half a second  .

web pages load fast , fast , fast over wifi (first phone to use 801  .

11n) and t    mobile 3g is more than adequate for my needs  .

cloud connection with google services is pretty amazing  .

voice to text is suprisingly awesome    i hardly ever bother with the onscreen keyboard now although it's as good as the iphone in my opinion  .

i took me about a week to really figure out what the phone can do  .

but if you bother to read the manual unlike me , then you may learn how to operate the phone quicker  .

coming from the iphone os , it took awhile for me to get over the fact that andriod is different and initially i is expecting things to work as they do on the iphone  .

but now that i've had the phone for a month , i'm in love with andriod and cannot imagine ever going back  .

google so far has been super responsive to customer needs  .

they just released an over the air update to the os that enables pinch    to    zoom in some of the native apps and cleaned up some 3g reception issues    and the phone has been out barely a month  .

google has done incredible work here with andriod    in a few years it has brought it to a level where it competes with the iphone os and there's no signs of it slowing down  .

the devleoper community for andriod is growing and apps get better with time and an increasing user base  .

the andriod market has a 24 hour return policy on all apps which helps foster useful , high quality apps over sheer quantity  .

apple will have to have to pull out something truly awesome with iphone 4  .

0 to reclaim the title of best smartphone and i'm glad there's some competition now as it means great things for the users of these devices .

the nexus beats the iphone is almost every category for me  .

i have used the iphone for the last 2 years better screen    the oled screen is so much better than the iphone  .

those youtube videos don't do the nexus justice  .

i have the iphone 3gs and nexus in hand and the iphone is not even close  .

nexus screen is much brighter with double the resolution better calls    i go really sick of att in socal  .

1 in 20 calls over 10 minutes would drop  .

tmobile works better for me  .

i sure some will wait for verizon to get the best call quality better battery    batter life on the nexus is about 20% better for me  .

i'm comparing when my iphone is new  .

also nexus batter is easily replaceable better build quality    not mentioned in many reviews , but the nexus is partially made of aluminum  .

it feels sturdier in the hand  .

two of my iphone friends also were impress with build quality better cpu    snapdragon from qualcomm is a beast  .

1000mhz vs 600 for iphone web page loading    nexus is a wee bit faster on most pages for me on wifi and 3g voice recognition    works great  .

i text using voice , search using voice , and make calls using voice i will not miss my iphone  .

it had better apps , but android gains thousands every month  .

the nexus is newer technology and simply more powerful than my iphone  .

i'm sure the next iphone will be awesome , but right now the nexus is king  .

i don't know how anyone can put an iphone above the nexus , especially when most of them do not even own a nexus i also know iphone fans will be hurt and are always flaming on any product than may be better  .

applel die hards are truly in fact from the same dna as steve jobs  .

i too love apple products , but steve has gotten too arrogant for my taste  .

he's an great ceo and makes some great products but lately he thinks he's an igod  .

he dumps on michael dell , dumps on google , and rips on adobe , and that's just getting started anyhow , anyone who really buys a nexus will be happy  .

it is a very good device updated  .

on feb 4 , 2010  .

have previously owned an iphone , htc diamond and nokia n95  .

i've engaged in mobile phone development on such platforms as windows mobile (c#) , iphone (objective c) and android (dalvik java)    i've had some experiences which suggest that the android operating system is at present the best mobile operating system available for mobile devices  .

we were just waiting for the right device to kick things off and the htc nexus one is that device if you intend to use a mobile phone for just phoning , the nexus one is not the so    called phone for you  .

something simpler may be more applicable  .

what the nexus one is , is a fully fledged computer and in that sense you could consider it like any netbook or laptop on the market    you should expect the nexus one to do everything your netbook or laptop can do , but with a smaller screen the most important benefit of the nexus one is it's integration of google services , like gmail , chat , finance , maps and other social networking applications like facebook and twitter  .

services can be synchronised providing seamless interaction with the internet services you are used to  .

the technological improvements are not lost on the user either  .

the 1ghz snap dragon chipset provides a very responsive experience and the capacity to use 3  .

5g , hsdpa standards and wifi for fantastic internet connectivity is excellent and (3g and hsdpa are not found on the iphone making the internet sluggish)  .

the nexus one (being android) allows for multiple concurrent applications to run (apple disallow this)  .

i found the device to survive very well for 20 hours (with wifi and gps on)  .

these features can be switched on and off easily to save battery power  .

not only a good all round consumer device , it provides a great platform for developing applications as well , not requiring signing like both apple iphone and nokia applications other applications like google voice and speech    to    text are also provided and surprisingly good given that they are new technologies  .

speech    to    text is quite accurate allowing a user to talk to the nexus one instead of entering text into text fields using the virtual keyboard  .

music can be accessed through the google player , spotify or the amazon mp3 store almost everything is customizable and if you're really so crazy about multi    touch , multi    touch will be available in europe but not in the us due to apple patents  .

installing and un    installing applications from the marketplace is easy and quick all in all , a completely different experience than what i've had with other phones and a glimpse on a bright future for the android operating system    definitely a device worth heavy consideration .

it has everything a smart phone should have today and it does each and every one of them extremely well  .

the snap dragon 1gigahertz processor flies  .

you really notice it in everything you do and the 512 ram is a huge plus  .

both help leap this phone performance wise over any other phone in the market currently .

as close to perfect as any phone on the market gets  .

best phone on the market and does most everything you could want it to , despite reviewers saying it cannot do many things that it can  .

it does support multi    touch , but google does not include multi    touch features in the default shipped applications (in the us market) , no doubt because they do not want to get sued by apple  .

there are already apps on the android market that use multi    touch , such as the dolphin web browser  .

also , you can sync exchange email , contacts , and calendar , and tasks ; but this requires an app called touch down , which is another $20  .

i hope to see this integrated into the next release of android multi    tasking is key for any power user  .

you get great functionality out of the box that the iphone requires jail breaking to come close to  .

for instance , you can install a lo    jack    like app (such as mobile defense ) that you can activate if your phone gets lost or stolen  .

that is possible because android allows apps to run as services in the background to get full exchange syncing (including calendar) , you need a paid app (~$20) to do this  .

but this is possible , and something all reviews i have read say is not possible on the nexus one .

it continues to surprise me with its usability  .

the more i get comfortable with the phone features better it gets .

we bought two of these the day they went on sale  .

both have performed without a hitch  .

we've had no problems with the touchscreen or 3g reception , which some have reported the screen is gorgeous , and the nexus really lets you show it off with the animated wallpapers  .

the processor is very fast ; on long webpages my iphone would checkerboard as it tried to keep up with scrolling  .

on the nexus , using the same wifi connection , their is no lag the active noise reduction is great  .

you can make a call from a noisy subway station or basketball game and the caller at the other end doesn't hears almost none of the background noise  .

this should be standard on every phone i'm not sure google will succeed in breaking the subsidized phone monopolies that some carriers have created for themselves , but i give them credit for trying  .

in the meantime , though , having support for the sale through google , support for the phone warranty through htc , and support for phone service through a third entity creates confusion  .

that has not been a problem for me , since both phones have been perfect , but it's a potential issue overall , there is no other phone that matches the screen , performance or customization of the nexus all in one package  .

it makes my iphone seem rather boring now .

multi    touch is there , as can be seen by downloading dolphin browser (free) from marketplace and using it as another browser (if not set as the default , you get a selection window when going to the internet)  .

so , maybe google did not want to flaunt the apple folks , who tend to be litigious  .

as to the cdma , it is my understanding from another website that the nexus one has the cdma built in , but not activated       mainly due (no doubt) to t    mobile and at t (like the rest of the civilized world , such as europe) being gsm kinda sloppy on your facts there , cnet  .

its the best phone to buy because its a phone that will consistently improve with time  .

eg if get a 2 year contact it will still be one of the best or the best phone in the market because all google needs to do is a software update if a better phone comes out .

i love this phone  .

i retired my g1 for it , and i could not be happier  .

iphone what  .

the best is yet to come  .

munish ghai  .

realtor  .

fresno , ca  .

ugh , for most people that cannot afford the nexus one (unlocked) this is a bummer  .

i don't want to switch to tmobile cuz' my at t plan is pretty inexpensive and i do not want to switch great phone tough i'm gonna hate my life not having it   /  .

if you're looking for an android phone , there is no comparison  .

even if youre just looking for a great phone , unless you're on at t or need at t 3g , this is the phone you want , hands down .

one hell of a phone and anyone who has a brain will buy an android phone  .

the sad fact is that a lot of the reviews on the nexus are done by i    phone loveing fan boys who will never leave apple no matter what and these same idiots hav not even used the nexus but will still slate it because its not apple  .

if it had apple on the front of the phone the idiots who are slating it would give it top marks well done google and htc keep up the good work updated  .

on jan 10 , 2010  .

the phone is sleek slim , modern very fast  .

takes great pics , has all the stuff the i phone has and then some  .

google has made its mark apple your in for a war  .

pound for pound the nexus one is the best phone on the market right now , and with google backing it , i am sure we will be seeing plenty of great things to come , apple's phone is nice , but outdated in many ways compared to this phone  .

great job google/htc in producing the #1 phone out right now .

love it  .

showed it to 2 friends , iphone guy and moto droid guy  .

they both were wanting this phone within 15 min of playing with it  .

this phone is like an iphone that runs android with affordable service if you are afraid of options and choices get an iphone as they are more simple  .

if you are someone who likes options and customization this phone if you are on the fence watch this video of the nexus in a 3d benchmark test (that it completely owns)  .

http  //www  .

engadget  .

com/2009/12/30/nexus    one    trounces    3d    benchmark    gets    caught    in    high    res    photosh/  .

it runs at almost 30 frames per second  .

try that on any other phone and people who actually dont own this phone need to stop reviewing it  .

more than half of the bad reviews are iphone people hating on it without even giving it a chance/testing it .

the pros by far outweigh the cons  .

google is a utlra responsive company  .

each android version keeps on getting better  .

compare that to how long apple took to get copy/paste and mms on the iphone , simple things  .

the issues with the market and network will get better within a year and this phone should definitely last a good 2 years  .

and not having multitouch for the google apps does not bother me at all  .

call quality and web browsing experience are amazing .

the best phone ever  .

i have been using it since early december and this is an amazing device  .

i stopped using my iphone .

once you get over the paranoia of google knowing everything about you , this is an incredible phone  .

far superior to the droid  .

the performance is much faster than the iphone  .

apps run pretty well  .

not a multi    media device like the iphone  .

i have 20 gigs of songs , movies , podcasts and audiobooks on my iphone  .

i see nothing here that can compete  .

but when it comes to keeping track of your contacts , email and google calendars , this phone is tops  .

better display than the iphone i wouldn't call this an iphone killer  .

not just because of the apps availability , although many apps that i use on the iphone just are not there for android yet  .

it really has more to do with the carrier  .

if this phone is available on verizon , it would own the market today  .

t    mobile is a sucky carrier  .

when you're on wi    fi it flies  .

on the supposed 3g t    mobile network it bogs down and goes into edge continually obviously the next gen iphone will have the amoled screen with a faster processor and availability on the verizon network  .

its going to be interesting to see .

i just love this phone , and dont need it to be or not to be iphone killer , its just a great phone , thanks google , htc and t    mobile  .

the secret / paradigm of the android o/s is    .

1) you sync your outlook calendar with igoogle/calendar (applet on the google lab , option) , then its automatically sync'd with the android phone (2    way) 2) you manage your contacts in gmail (igoogle/gmail) and they are automatically sync'd with the android phone (2    way) now the missing piece , the outlook/contacts to gmail/contacts  .

a google lap applet to sync outlook contacts to igoogle/gmail/contacts , which would then be automatically sync'd with the android phone (2    way) its this paradigm ,  .

microsoft outlook\ (contacts , calendar) sync's with igoogle\ (contacts , calendar) , which sync's with android phone google , is just a little late filling in the missing link    calendar works great  .

(love it)  .

contacts is a little late to the party .

overall what google have done is bring out something that people want  .

effectively this is the only real player in the iphone war that has any chance of succeeding and if it does not i will be suprised  .

one of the biggest problems with the iphone is its useless camera  .

3mp and no flash useless in all but the best conditions  .

this camera even though only 5mp is streets ahead and will only get better  .

the processor is also lightning fast in phone terms and when it is finally used to its full extent will kick ass with well written apps  .

the screen is faultless and it is slim and light  .

this phone without a doubt is far superior to the iphone and i dont see me ever going back to it  .

i have had quite enough of apple telling me what airtime i can use and trying at every turn to tie me into using there products  .

thank you google for giving me a way out bottom line , buy it and throw your iphone in the bin  .

(ok dont do that sell it on ebay and use the money to buy one of these , you will not regret it updated  .

contrary to what others believe  .

the nexus one is not just an iphone clone  .

i give credit to apple for making a smartphone that is functional and with the ability to have major 3rd party app support  .

without that support , the iphone would have faded just as other popular phones have in the past  .

but the value and use of the android platform , and the existing iphone , will only is only as good as the third party app developers supporting it  .

this being the case , the nexus one has a very bright future  .

i think people are missing the big picture here  .

the nexus one isn  .

t the thing everyone wants  .

sure it has the most powerful processor ever to be endowed upon a phone  .

but the major component is what is powering this beast , and that is the android os  .

developers can and will now go blow for blow with the iphone and its never ending wardrobe of apps  .

apple officially started the game  .

but with the google android os being open source , the game has been kicked up to a whole new level updated  .

on jan 7 , 2010  .

i just sold my iphone  .

i received my nexus one last night  .

ive played with it all day yesterday and can honestly say my macbook has a new friend i love it  .

i is surfing the web , watching videos , visting flash sites with video  .

i can now watch videos i is not able to with my ipod  .

i can now listen to pandora radio and shoot off an email or read my texts  .

my iphone would not allow me to do that  .

it would close my app to open another app i love this phone  .

overall , the only comparable smartphone to iphone 3gs  .

market could use some work  .

if you wanna try android and got sick of winmobile , this is you phone  .

you could consider htc desire also if you can pay more cash , but you'll lose google voice search and gain htc sense ui and a trackpad which maybe less accurate than a trackball sometimes updated  .

on apr 21 , 2010  .

i came from the iphone 3g  .

great boost in speed , the screen is crisper , and the phone doesn't get warm/hot at all i've had it for about 2 weeks now , and i'm discovering new stuff everyday  .

definitely more geared towards the geek/power    user    type but iphone switchers wo not be disappointed at all  .

the os is definitely better than the iphone's and is comparable to web os  .

i would like to see some more official apps come out but through the open source of android you can get apps for free (download them on the internet)  .

not a lot of accessories at the moment i've tested it as a gps , works great last note would be flash 10  .

that's the only thing missing from this phone in my opinion i would recommend this phone to anyone switching over from any phone .

i have owned and used significantly the blackberry 9800 , iphone , htc tp2 , and i could not find a phone that fit my needs as perfectly as the nexusone  .

it's closest to the iphone in terms of use and interface , but much more customizable  .

while i am an apple fan (ipods and macbook pro) , i prefer google's approach and vision for their handset/android os .

i love this phone  .

did i tell you that it's fast  .

accelerometer , bluetooth , 5mp camera w/flash , replaceable battery , unlocked , good call quality , app store , mp3 store , up to 32gb storage , beautiful amoled screen (but not in bright sun) , smart , sexy (looks way better than the iphone imo) the o/s is constantly evolving , does video , cool active wallpapers , paired beautifully with my kenwood dnx8120 multimedia deck in my car , plays stereo bluetooth over it  .

i've only had it for two days , so i'm still discovering , but this phone can do alot  .

nephew has an iphone 3gs , and this phone is just better  .

apple's ui is top of the heap , no doubt , but the nexus one is no slouch with it's interface , and overall it just performs better and has better features  .

and you can replace the battery  .

i get about a day and a half to two on the battery with some some light calling and moderate browsing , with some music playing thrown in  .

cant wait to try out the android app market to see what's out there  .

havent enjoyed a piece of tech this much since i bought my amiga 1000 updated  .

on mar 26 , 2010  .

the nexus one is the best phone on the market right now considering performance , display , camera , networks , os , and apps  .

the android platform is developing quality products rapidly , so look for more innovation to come .

have been using the phone for a month , i found the machine very fast in browsing the internet , running google earth and 360' street view etc  .

the photo gallery is really nice , i have no problem in browsing thousand of photos loaded into the sdcard  .

however , the machine do not play wma audio , no fm radio is not convenience for me , hope that google will put them in the next update  .

still waiting for flash 10  .

1 from adobe .

after a two month long affair with the samsung behold ii , i decided to cast it away for the nexus one  .

in hindsight , i should have went with the n1 from the start , but it was not available at the time  .

i'd almost given up on an android phone  .

most of the android phones out there have some sort of ui attached to them that hinder the phone rather than help them  .

from this there's only three phones now , g1 , mytouch 3g , and the nexus one my first impression of the phone is the size of the screen , which is larger than most standard screens , and the overall build of the phone  .

this is definitely a solidly built phone that doesn't feel cheap by any means  .

turning it on i knew that amoled screens look great , but the n1 took that to a new level  .

the 480 x 800 resolution really makes the screen clear  .

images almost pop off the screen after boot up , i is definitely impressed with the overall performance of the phone  .

the 1 ghz snapdragon processor makes navigating the phone lightning quick  .

i couldn't hardly find a program or function that didn't boot up almost immediately  .

it's just that good the n1 is running android 2  .

1 , and as of february 2010 , has multitouch support  .

i have to say that anyone who doesn't have an android phone , they don't know what they are missing out on  .

virtually every facet of the layout is customizable  .

the live wallpapers are wonderful too and run very smoothly  .

there are 5 home screens on this phone in stock mode , but there are home replacements that allow more  .

the os itself is the other half of this phone  .

while the insane tech specs for this phone could practically sell it to any technophile , the android os seals the deal aside from all the android love , the most basic functions of the phone work nicely  .

callers have said that i sounded as though i were on a land line or at least a very good cordless  .

most of the phone is fairly intuitive  .

i don't think i ever had much problem finding functions or changing settings  .

of course , i had experience with my behold ii , but i don't think that anyone could not figure this phone out with a little playing around the multimedia functions of this phone are wonderful , but a bit limited  .

i found the stock music player to be basic and barebones  .

there is no eq settings or any flashy appearance , but it got the job done  .

still , it's something that i would like to see google improve upon with future android releases  .

the camera takes decent photos , but there is some noise and graininess to the pictures  .

the flash , however , works nicely and is very bright  .

the camera does lack a few options , but this is nothing that cannot be improved upon  .

video goes all the way up to 720p , but it's only at 20 frames per second so that might cause it to look choppy considering most tvs display at 24 fps some of the other functions like gps work fairly well  .

the gps is a little off , but not terribly so  .

wifi is very fast to connect to a hotspot or router  .

the accelerometer is near instantaneous when used  .

the auto brightness function is a bit off , but not a real negative most of the negatives with this phone are the weak stock music player , the weak ringer volume which can make the phone difficult to hear in a crowded or noisy room , and answering the phone requires a slide rather than a touch  .

the sliding is similar to the unlock function (which on this phone is the same) of the ipod or iphone  .

i also had some issues with entering text  .

the n1 virtual keyboard is not quite as accurate as the iphone or even the behold ii  .

still , it's not terrible by any means battery life on this phone is surprisingly good  .

i is able to leave wifi on , turning off background services and gps , listen to pandora radio for almost an hour and a half and it only depleted the battery 5% which is very impressive  .

i imagine with all services and options running , one could get a good days use out of the phone easily in conclusion , i'd have to say that virtually any problems with this phone are software related and in the future could be resolved  .

it's definitely worth it at either $179 or the $530  .

so you know , i had mine engraved with my name which removes the possibility of sending it back  .

that's how much i enjoy this phone updated  .

on may 12 , 2010  .

the bottom line here is that this is a powerful phone that packs nearly everything you want in a phone inside an htc shell  .

tapping , scrolling , apps , google ingenuity , and so forth sets a new standard on how phones will be produced first of all , the 3  .

7 screen is vivid , clear , and crisp  .

everything comes out as pristine web browsing is just as good as it would be on the iphone 3gs except faster  .

i know there is a lot of bitterness and head shaking when the n1 supposedly lacked pinch and zoom , but it's on the phone  .

i use it , it works perfectly , and if that is truly an issue , it surely is addressed  .

now the one thing that does get in the way time to time are the tapping zooming options on the bottom right hand portion of the screen  .

it just sits there and sometimes can get in the way of images , links , text fields , and so forth  .

however , it is a very minor problem the camera is pretty amazing  .

it is a 5mp camera , and though it is not as good as my former phone's camera , the nokia n97 , it surely is in the same ballpark  .

the only complaint i have is the flash sometimes being too bright when taking close    up shots  .

if someone has fair skin , the n1 flash will make sure that they appear extremely white in the photos saved in your gallery  .

otherwise , the n1's camera is equipped with scene modes , zoom , and different coloring options like sepia , black and white , polarization , and so forth the video recording is solid  .

when uploaded to your pc , the resolution and video quality is good enough to watch in any media player in full screen mode without any to little discomfort or annoyance when viewing  .

another cool feature when in video mode is that when you are finished shooting a video , you can upload straight to youtube  .

how cool is that  .

now that mp3 player it is a decent media player  .

it is sort of intuitive  .

however , if you bluetooth a song from your computer , or any external source to your nex1 , it automatically gets put into a category titled bluetooth  .

i didn't understand this  .

why could it not just be put into a dedicated mp3 folder  .

it's odd  .

i know people cringe when i say this because it does sound cliche , but it surely is not on par with the iphone's ipod player because , well , the ipod player is just so intuitive  .

in short , it just makes sense  .

people wonder why the track ball is on the phone  .

personally i like it  .

in text fields , you can just scroll with that little ball and get to places where you want to go  .

if i want to delete something in a particular part of a message i am composing , it is much more difficult to get back to that part of the text by pressing the screen with my finger  .

with the track ball , i just scroll my way to that particular part of the text field , hit backspace , or add a word or two , or what have you  .

the trackball also lights up periodically if you have an unattended notification , like an email , or a text , or a missed call the dedicated keys above the trackball       back , options , home , and search , are responsive as long as the phone is not laying flat  .

it seems for the phone to recognize or sense your touch when pressing these keys , contact must be made toward the top of the keys in order for you to get the desired response  .

i have had some trouble , but not too much with them  .

however , it can become quite tedious when you just hit and hit and hit and receive no response  .

this took me a little getting used to , but alas ; i am used to it and have little to no issues with these four keys now widgets are available  .

they are helpful , convenient , and i use four in particular  .

the 1st , weather and news app  .

duh  .

the 2nd , facebook widget  .

of course  .

3rd , connectivity widget  .

this widget allows me to power on or off any connection signal on my phone , such as radio , wifi , bluetooth , sync , and also the brightness of the screen  .

it's just one of those things on the phone that just makes sense  .

the 4th is the google search widget equipped with voice command  .

you can search for anything on the web , directions to a desired location , and even desired locations such as restaurants , or movie theaters near you call quality is good  .

funny how i get to this toward the tail end i am reviewing a phone  .

the phone app is what any phone app is  .

hit phone , the virtual keypad pops up  .

there are tabs for your contacts , call log , and favorites  .

the messaging app is what a messaging app is  .

composing messages is easy  .

one quirk about this messaging app is annoying  .

with nearly every phone i have used , you can type a contact's name in the to   field , and the contact would then be selected , or you are given options of whom you would like to select  .

now with the nex1  .

you can type in the initial digits of a number and then select a contact , but not their name odd would not you say  .

it just does not make sense  .

this is my largest gripe , but it just delays my texting by a significant amount of seconds .

all in all and excellent phone/portable computer/ media capture device  .

i is an early adopter of the g1 and migrating away from the hardware keyboard took a step of faith    not disappointed i did .

i ordered the phone during the press conference and have had it since the day after  .

after having it for about a month , i am continually impressed by what it can do  .

the only thing i think holding it back from the full 5 stars is a media player  .

i use the app meridian to do my playing (function over form) , but it would be great if meridian could combine with gallery to have both form and function  .

and swype is a must have for all phones going forward  .

absolutely changes the game as far as typing is concerned  .

all in all , would i recommend this to someone trying to decide between an iphone and an n1  .

probably depends on the person  .

the iphone is hands down better in the media department currently (i'm sure there will either be an update from google to address this , or someone will create a program , etc  .

at some point)  .

so if you are going to use it just for that , i would recommend the iphone  .

if you are even slightly technologically inclined , the n1 offers way too much freedom for it to even be close  .

the n1 is a great smartphone that does not change the industry drastically like the original iphone did , but it definitely moves the industry along .

i had a rooted g1 since it came out and is no stranger to the android experience       both for the good and bad  .

the rooted aspect of the phone gave me great variety in apps and capabilities , but also made for a less than smooth experience  .

i briefly had a nokia n900 which is even less user friendly than i had read , and returned it , ordering the nexus the same day  .

i am one of the lucky ones who haven't had any 3g connectivity issues , and it's worked seamlessly (metro nyc area here)  .

the phone flies  .

everything you open , work on , switch to , or close , happens almost instantaneously  .

android 2  .

1 is extremely flexible and intuitive , and the learning curve is much lower than the blackberry i had previously or the user    unfriendly nokia  .

the battery life thus far has been about average , nothing exceptional , but my g1 required a late day charge to make it through as well  .

the live wallpapers are nice , but totally useless , i'll probably go back to standard wallpapers once the novelty wears off  .

google navigation is very nice for a free nav system , though it will take you a block or two off on occasion  .

the apps are generous and useful , even if the app store is poorly organized and the search function could be more refined there  .

the cloud based voice recognition is nice , but the google voice transcribers have a tough time deciphering my ny accent sometimes  .

call quality is good to very good , depending on your location  .

the biggest drawback appears to be the strength       or weakness       of t    mobile's 3g network  .

i'm in a major metropolitan area (nyc) and rarely drop to edge network speeds  .

i also haven't experienced any of the 3g connectivity bugs reported by numerous n1 owners , so i cannot comment to that  .

also , the ota update google is pushing out this week adds multi    touch to native apps , enhances the navigation app , and a few other tweaks  .

hopefully , google will eventually add a native tethering app (either via wifi or usb , i could go either way) , and will allow apps to be stored on the sd card  .

currently apps can only be stored on the 512 mb of internal memory , although i have quite a few apps on my phone now and still have about 150 mb remaining  .

i had about a hundred apps on my rooted g1 (which does allow apps saved to the sd card) and i have learned that i did not use about 90% of them  .

so the current storage system for me is fine  .

i cannot recommend this phone highly enough for anyone looking for a smooth , fast android experience .

most definitely the best android phone on the market  .

i would put this against the iphone anytime .

the reference phone for android  .

much better than droid  .

others should just use the google experience model and be done with it .

ive tried every android phone from every major us carrier with the exception of the droid eris , and this phone is very close to a combo between the droid and samsung moment , taking the best from each it seems (except hard keyboard)  .

amoled screen , 1 ghz chipset  .

this phone is extremely fast as one who never really cared for soft keys , even i must admit the speed increase really helps the soft keys on the nexus  .

of course with vocal recog , you may never need it , as speech to text is very accurate so far definitely a winner in my book  .

time to sell the g1 .

hands    down the best android phone on the market  .

i loved the moto droid for its large screen and speed , but also liked the eris/hero for it's small form    factor  .

in my oppinion , the nexus one is a great hybrid of both of these phones and is a lot faster to boot  .

i've only had it for a few hours now , but i'm already in love .

the phone is great since updating to froyo 2  .

2 , havent seen anything bad yet  .

only if the phone came in black .

the nexus one is one top    notch phone and certainly has an upper hand over the iphone in several areas as discussed above  .

now having read the google nexus one review , please head for the nexus one google store and get hold of this masterpiece .

pros continued   i am with t    mobile and coming off of a cliq  .

the internet , even on edge , is fast  .

the screen is beautiful with brighter brights and rich darks  .

i am a huge fan of the pinch to zoom  .

talk to text (for search , texts , etc) makes this feel like so much more than a phone  .

this is a true smart phone  .

the sensitivity is great , even with a screen protector  .

even without tweaking , straight out of the box , this is an amazing piece of hardware  .

i think the camera is exceptional  .

the phone also feels very sturdy and well    put    together , without that clunky brick feel cons continued   i do not have any problems with the hardware itself  .

i would suggest flash 10  .

1 and sensitivity around the edges for a software update  .

things that can be corrected through the market (for me) include , keyboard    prefer a nicer one , pic editing (picsay is great for that) , more attractive widgets and clock (beautiful widgets is my favorite) , and adding a few apps to improve on an already wonderful functionality  .

the only use for the track ball so far is for scrolling through long    winded reviews  .

; )  .

if you are coming from another android phone , this will surpass all your expectations  .

to those who worry about the price , (even though it is worth it) look at any unlocked nice smart phone  .

the price is comparible to most  .

to those who have never used android , you have the power to tweak and personalize most of the software  .

please research it more and educate yourself of all android has to offer  .

to everyone , please blame your carrier for your connectivity problems , not the nexus  .

oh , and go buy the nexus one  .

lol  .

i love text to talk  .

missing two critical applications (tethering sim card management)  .

needs improvement on speakers  .

it would have been nice to include two sim cards too .

this phone is sexy , sturdy , incredibly customizable and pretty much does everything without having to jailbreak or root the phone  .

i've used the droid , the iphone 3gs , the palm pre , and the storm  .

the nexus one hands down is a better experience    well , except for the 3g issues  .

even with the google update that is supposed to fix the problem , nothing got better  .

t    mobile is not the best carrier , and with a weak antenna that just compounds the problem  .

i'd give it 5 stars if it were not for the 3g issue .

i love that as an open platform  .

you can install market and non    market apps no device is perfect  .

im in the wireless biz and this device is one of the best ive ever used .

i have had the phone for roughly 2 weeks now and wanted to wait to give it a review until i had a good grasp on the phone attractiveness is not necessarily a huge deal for me but i love the look of this phone  .

it looks like what it is    a workhorse  .

no frills , nothing the design is very nice as well with very utilitarian aspects  .

the volume rocker is in the perfect place for adjusting the volume while talking  .

the four buttons on the front don't get in the way while navigating through the phone  .

the only design feature i don't like is the trackball  .

it just feels cheap and i am not very accurate when using it  .

i find the trackball is necessary to use when correcting my typing (more on the keyboard later) , but when navigating to my mistake i keep jumping to the wrong place  .

some people have complained about using these buttons because they won't register their touch    to them all i can say is hit the button  .

its pretty easy , and i'm not having troubles at all the user    interface and web is very intuitive and smooth  .

scrolling through the web pages , menus , etc  .

is very smooth and is not jumpy at all  .

some webpages do have a problem with scrolling though , but i think its because there may be too many flash animations to load  .

its fine on espn or your favorite news source a lot of reviews i have read complained about the on screen keyboard being not accurate  .

i have decided that complaint comes up because they have used another smartphone extensively  .

this is my first smartphone and i have no problems using the keyboard in landscape mode and am able to type quickly with both thumbs  .

the keyboard in portrait is another animal though  .

i have huge hands so i can only type with one thumb and very slowly because i have to use the edge of my thumb to type  .

sometimes the phone will go through a fit with me while using the keyboard and it won't change from portrait to landscape mode when i turn the phone  .

very frustrating  .

as far as the camera on the phone i is very impressed with it  .

it took great pictures that were clear both on the phone and the computer screen  .

the same goes for capturing video battery life is lacking on the device  .

if i am using it constantly surfing the web , talking on the phone , texting , etc  .

the battery lasts about 6    8 hours (i have not exactly timed it)  .

i thought my 5 year old motorola nextel phone is bad because i needed to charge it every 24 hours  .

but 6    8 hours is bad  .

i guess i have to invest in another charger for work to sum things up , i highly recommend this phone  .

like i said its a workhorse that gets things done , but stay close to a charger .

like other android phones , the nexus one forces you to store apps on the internal memory not true , i store all my apps on the 16gb memory card of my t    mobile mytouch .

i moved up from a blackberry pearl flip (8220) , so the nexus is a big change  .

the first thing i noticed as i started to configure nexus is its beautiful screen  .

then i is grateful for well    designed menus , and the android market which let me add functions very quickly and easily i knew that exchange integration would be tough , had done enough research to settle on nitrodesk's touchdown app , which loaded and immediately started pulling down mail , contacts , calendar and task information (no notes , though)  .

it took around 20 minutes to get everything loaded over wifi it's great to have a large , bright screen  .

web pages are readable now , though the reviewers are right about the need for multi    touch (apple's pinch    and    zoom system where you can expand , contract and re    orient images or web pages by using two fingers at a time)    the nexus one's browser's zoom control is awkward the phone's settings menus are very well done  .

call forwarding is easy to configure (at least on t    mobile)  .

some configuration choices are mis    placed (the google voice application's settings control whether gv or your carrier controls the outgoing calls , which can lead to confusion) android market makes it easy to download new apps , and the apps are useful (from kayak , to fandango , to google's sky application for identifying constellations)  .

be careful with exotic voip apps , though    i had to rebuild the phone after one of them corrupted the phone's basic calling functions simple telephone calls are tougher than they should be  .

to answer you have to swipe your finger across the screen    tougher than just stabbing a button , and you'll probably miss a couple of calls  .

to call is easy enough , but it's not as fast as hitting a blackberry call button and starting to type a name in the text box  .

there is no classic telephone ring tone    just a bunch of hip    to    goofy tones that you may not feel comfortable hearing in conservative business meetings do not get this phone if you want full exchange compatibility and the most efficient way to make phone calls and read email  .

blackberry is better for these things  .

but if you want to use more of the internet while on the go , and especially if you find yourself relying on lots of google web applications (picasa , gmail , voice , etc  .

) the nexus one is a good way to expand your mobile computing power updated  .

on jan 11 , 2010  .

i actually like the stock android minus the htc sense ui  .

moving between applications or home screens is smooth and fast , call quality has been very good and no one has had a problem hearing me  .

speaker phone is okay i have seen worse that is for sure  .

the phone is fast i think android 2  .

1 needs refinement as it's not as polished as the iphone os (but i do like android better than iphone os) t    mobile 3g is spotty at my home  .

i live 25 miles south east of nashville , tn we do have 3g service in my area but it's spotty  .

my phone flips between 3g and edge constantly at home but yet my short time with an hd2 held and kept a 3g signal  .

same at the t    mobile store all their phones (and they are 3 or 4 miles from my house) hold on a 3g signal while the nexus one kept switching to edge  .

now when i go downtown nashville , tn the phone picked up and held a 3g signal the whole time even in and out of buildings full 3g and amazing speeds  .

the stock android keyboard can be buggy as well  .

i have hit buttons and it's picked up the letter next to it  .

the home , menu , back and search buttons across the bottom you have to hit a hair above them not directly on the icon  .

the track ball is pointless it blinks when you have notifications but using it to scroll is awkward since you have a large 3  .

7 inch touch screen to just touch what you want to do the feel of the phone in your hand is awesome before every hooking it up to service or even turning it on right out of the box it had a great feel and balance in your hand  .

overall a pretty good device android 2  .

1 needs some work and the verizon/sprint cdma/evdo version's cannot come out fast enough cannot wait to see how the verizon/sprint models hold a 3g signal t    mobile just has spotty coverage and even at t's 3g map is limited compared to verizon and sprint (who use the same technology and roam on each others networks) with out the 3g problems with t    mobile i would give this phone 4    4  .

5 stars not really the phones fault t    mobile is spotty but when an hd2 made by the same company and operating on the same network can hold and keep a 3g signal there has to be an issue with the antenna or software on the phone .

i am happy with this phone  .

google is quick to implement updates (recent update allowed pinch to zoom feature)  .

i'm not a big fan of touchpads but i got used to it am able to text almost error free now  .

the auto fill function is awesome too when texting  .

instead of just throwing a word in there , it gives you a number of options below the actual text field  .

it's tough to beat the price and i would most certainly recommend this phone to anyone .

please tell me why , an unlocked nexus one with no carrier , is or is not able to make and receive phone calls via a wifi internet connection on skype or gizmo  .

if so can it use google voice to record or redirect calls it has wifi , can multi task and a mic .

i have been using a iphone 3g 3gs for about two years and i decided to try a nexus one and hear are my thoughts after two weeks of using the phone as my primary communications device  .

i is using an unlocked version on my at t network (only edge supported)  .

i liked the large and very sharp screen which is much better then the iphone , i also liked the fact i can set    up the phone to look and function like i want , which the iphone lacks in that area  .

i received the multi    touch upgrade which i could not have lived without and it worked smooth like my apple device  .

the internet connection is quick for the edge 2g network because of the speed of the nexus one which impress me allot  .

allot of positives for a new model phone from a well known company here is what i did not like about the phone and this is based on my experience only  .

the battery life is not up to par for the money they are getting for the unlocked version from google  .

i had several screen freeze problems when i is opening applications and i noticed it more when i enabled the live backgrounds compared to the static ones  .

i had several of my clients tell me the call quality is terrible compared to my iphone and would always ask me if i had changed phones i used android apps that where similar to ones i used on the iphone so i could make an honest comparison and i found most of them where ok , but they always had things that fell short of the apps from the itunes store  .

i always hated the fact that i am tied to itunes for backing up and getting updates , but i always know the interface works and the support i get from apple is superior to the half ass support i got from google i honestly think that google should have done a little more homework and maybe talked to some dedicated iphone users like myself and asked us what we would like changed and they would have a winner compared to a device that has some serious issues and is priced way to high for an economy that has been changed to a value added consumer that is going to look at every touch screen device and the first words that come out of my mouth is how does it compare to the iphone apple has become a 50 billion dollar company because they build great devices that consumers want  .

mac pc's , ipods and iphones  .

go into an apple store sometime and i can assure you it will never be empty  .

steve jobs has surrounded himself with folks who design great products and are ahead of the curve sometimes i think these companies who attempt to build a super phone get they're input from a bunch of techno dweebs who only use the thing to play music and games and never use it for what it is designed for , a phone and pda device  .

oh well those are my thoughts and opinions , i hope it helps  .

what google tried to do with this device is to set the standard of what android is capable of doing  .

i think google got frustrated with how repeatedly , each of the manufacturers has missed the mark , either in hardware or software  .

if you are trying to bring something that will kill any existing devices it has to be a complete knock out  .

i have never used an iphone , but once my boss , who uses one told me it's unreal what this device can do  .

i use windows mobile phones and have jumped on each new one that has been dubbed the iphone killer  .

i like the freedom of customization wm devices give me but i am increasingly frustrated with them  .

i am now on the at t tilt 2 which is also dubbed iphone killer but alas far from being that  .

the nexus has come very close and i hope things will pick up from here moving forward  .

google has raised the bar and now i know i am very close to ditching wm and moving on  .

it is sad that wm devices are even not being mentioned when it comes to comparing the nexus  .

i believe the end is near for wm unless something really dramatic happens on that platform  .

for now it is a 2 way race between android devices and iphone  .

as i said in the beginning for anything to be an iphone killer it will have to bring a knock punch into the ring  .

so far non of the existing devices has done that  .

the droid came very close and also missed the mark with hard ware  .

a boxer who fights a reigning champion will always loss if he tries to win on points  .

well done google now let the game begin  .

thank iphone for setting the standard of mobile devices  .

the iphones days are numbered unless apple can begin to free it up a little  .

for now i will stay with my tilt 2 on the worst network ever , until the day i will receive a complete freedom of phone and network choice with one device  .

thank you for reading .

i sold mine after 2 weeks for the negative reasons listed above it really doesnt live up to the hype and the fact everything from warranty and buying the actual phone has to be done on line is pretty sorry i bought a htc desire and its truly what the n1 should have been the n1 is just a mistake plagued with bugs and software and hardware issues  .

i would say that the phone is over pricy and after paying this price you wo not even get the basic things like email client and 3g speed (at t) .

first , let me state that i do not own an iphone  .

i own an original samsun instinct , almost two years old  .

i've kept my instinct this long because it does what i need it to do (phone , text , email , twitter , facebook , etc) and it does it well  .

it may not be pretty , but at least i am not paying out the nose for the thing we all thougt google is going to revolutionize the smartphone industry in a similar way apple did  .

i is literally frothing at the mouth in anticipation for the nexus one  .

this is going to be the phone that changes everything it is not the phone is a good smartphone that's it  .

there is nothing special about it at all  .

the ability to purchase it without a contact  .

you can do that with any phone  .

get it unlocked  .

you can unlock any phone you buy , you just need to jump through some hoops with your service provider where is the innovation  .

where is the google i know and love that prides itself on high quality , cheap , open products  .

this phone is exactly the same as the htc hero except for a slightly larger screen and faster processor what is all the fuss about  .

needless to say , i put my phone into the mail today to return it to google  .

i am going back to my instinct for now and will patiently wait for something grand from someone .

i bought the phone as a replacement to my iphone 3g that is ruined by water damage  .

i can say that's its not an i    phone but a decent smart phone after using this phone for four days the screen shattered after a fall from a counter top at work onto a commercial carpeted floor something that had happened countless times to my i    phone without an issue another thing about the phone is the os  .

it's nice in some ways , like customization , but it lags from time to time when typing  .

another issue that bothers me is the delay between when you add a number to your phone book to the time it takes to appear in your phone book  .

it has taken several hours for me the bottom line is that given the option i would go back to the i    phone 3g , and i can not wait for my i    phone 4 to come in on the 24th .

i'm a big fan of the android os , especially now that the number of apps is catching up to the iphone  .

this is an android phone  .

other than that , not too much good to say about this product i had been using the first android phone , the g1 , for about a year and a half , so i expected considerable improvements with the nexus one  .

i is disappointed  .

it is actually slower , and there seems to have been an actual de    evolution in design functionality  .

for instance , to get to the phone screen on the g1 , you press the green phone button from any screen   one click , less than one second  .

to get to the phone on the n1 , you press the home button , wait a second or two while it loads the home screen , press the on    screen phone button , and wait a second or two while the phone screen loads  .

alternatively , hold down the home key for about a second , and a screen of recently    used apps pops up  .

if the phone button happens to be there , press that and wait while the phone screen loads  .

two clicks , 3    5 seconds to even initiate your call other problems include battery life (this is a mobile phone only in that you can carry it from charging point to charging point if you are a moderate to heavy user , as i am) ; speaker phone (tin can    and    string quality) ; google support ('nuff said) ; price ; and a very , very , very unfortunate tendency towards inexplicable screen freezes that require a restart or even popping the battery out  .

phone 3g reception are spotty , and while this may be partially a t    mobile problem , it's worse with this phone than my old t    mobile g1 the biggest problem , however , is the keyboard  .

this is the real reason not to buy this phone i have used the keyboard that comes loaded on the phone , and three others that i downloaded from the app store  .

they are all unusably bad  .

screen sensitivity is poor , so it's very easy to push the keys adjacent to the character you want  .

basic punctuation marks like apostrophes , dashes and colons require going into sub    menus or squinting at the very tiny , faint alt    characters  .

the autocomplete feature is extremely frustrating  .

for example , trying to type  .

com results in an autochange to  .

m for some reason , and working around it takes many seconds i just composed test messages on my g1 and the nexus one  .

g1   13 seconds  .

nexus   38 seconds  .

i am an experienced , savvy mobile user , and i've had a month to practice on the nexus , so these results are not due to a learning curve both google and t    mobile support folks have the same suggestion to fix the problem   download and use the swype keyboard  .

unfortunately ,  swype is not available in the android market , and the swype company has no plans to make it available  .

in short , even t    mobile and google concede that the stock keyboard is not viable , and their proposed solution is to download a third    party solution that you cannot actually get  .

even if it were available , however , swype is not a magic bullet , and has signficant drawbacks of its own   for one thing , it essentially requires you to learn an entirely new style of text entry to get speeds almost as good as a standard physical keyboard if you have too much cash lying around , don't mind waiting through freezeups , aren't planning on making phone calls , and do not think you'll ever need to enter text , the nexus one might be a good choice for you  .

otherwise , stay far , far away from it .

had the phone for less than 24 hrs  .

made one call  .

i had to ship it back for repair  .

because i could not hear or talk with the phone on my ear  .

i had to use the speaker  .

forget about finding negative comments or writing one on u tube's nexus page  .

if it's negative , it gets deleted .

if you are on gmail or google apps and on t    mobile this is a smokin fast device with a great ui  .

it's not a simplistic at the iphone but you can do just about anything with it  .

but if you need exchange calendar support , you should wait to see if google adds it  .

there are a couple of decent add    ons out there  .

i used touchdown on my g1 , but unless they improved since the last time i used them , i will be going back to my unlocked iphone on tmo and waiting for the hd2 or other superphone to come out , preferably one that supports multiple exchange accounts as i use exchange both at work and on client sites .

not only do you have to remove the battery constantly to make the phone work    t    mobile blames it on htc (or google) and htc (or google) blames it on t    mobile  .

the wifi is spotty and the fact that the touchscreen gets unresponsive makes it useless  insert lots of profanity here   .

going back to the iphone as soon as practical .

this phone is not worth the hype  .

i paided over $500 for a phone that is not working in just 1 month  .

the only option is to be without a phone for 2 weeks while they repair it or swap it for a used (a/k/a refurbished) phone  .

what a joke  .

buy a phone from one of the stores , you will at least get customer service at the store  .

dealing with google on troubleshooting the phone is terrible  .

i is so excited about this phone an it is an extreme let down  .

when the phone works it is a fun phone  .

but , if it does not work , it is not worth it  .

my recommendation is that you do not take a chance on it , unless you have $500 to waste .

i would not reccomend it .

i have been using the phone for 2 weeks now and here is my in depth review the android software is really great , easy to use , very responsive and you could access things easily  .

i fell in love with it from the moment i start using it  .

the processor is the fastest you could get currently so menus and apps are very responsive  .

amoled screen is bright and great to look at  .

but forget about using it outdoor in the bright sun  .

i tried using it in a cab on a bright day and i could not even send a text message correctly due to the glare  .

you could barely see anything on the screen  .

this is not due to poor design of the phone as it affects all amoled screen  .

the learning curve is a bit steeper but once you get the hang of it , you would grow to like it  .

i have been using the iphone for 3 years now and i dare to say this has the potential to be an iphone killer  .

the phone supports multi touch  .

it is just that multi touch does not work on any of the built in apps like pictures or web browser  .

i install dragon browser and immediately i could perform multi touch  .

so it depends on the app you install if it supports multi touch  .

by default , the nexus one has multi touch bulit in to really enjoy the full potential of the phone , it is best that you have google account  .

you cannot sync emails , contacts or calendars with microsoft outlook  .

everything is sync from the google servers  .

there are no software to sync your music or photos so this has to be done manually by transferring it to the included sd card  .

so you have to keep deleting songs , videos and photos manually each time  .

but if you have a google account , everything is done automatically  .

you contacts would be sync with your gmail account  .

if your friends are also using gmail , it would show you an icon to say that they are on line for chatting  .

nice  .

photos are sync with your picasa account  .

nothing is actually stored on the phone itself and this is what they mean by cloud computing the problem i have is with the 3g connection  .

it does not hang on the signal at all and keeps switching between 3g and 2g  .

once it switches , you lose any phone conversation you are having  .

at home , i could not last more than 2 minutes on the phone before it gets cut off  .

i switch my sim card to and iphone and also to se aino and both phones has no problems at all at the same location  .

they display 3 bars of 3g signal even out on the street , the 3g signals could never seem to hold on for long  .

worst part is , once it switches to 2g , you would have problems connecting to the internet , sending sms or even making calls  .

mms does not seem to work either  .

tried contacting google but it seems the support e    mail is answered by a computer every time  .

the reply e    mails gave recommendations on things to try that i do not even ask and 99% of the time , you do not get any reply  .

no one can tell you how to set the settings to get mms working or gprs working  .

you have to do your own search on the forums across the net  .

for such a potential phone , this ruins the experience for me and i would never get another htc or google phone if you have a very strong 3g signal at home and workplace and only moves around this area , i say buy this phone  .

the android interface and it's potential are truly amazing  .

but if you now even have only 3 bars of 3g connection with the current phone , forget about buying it  .

90% chances you would have lost connection with this phone  .

it would cause lots of frustration .

too early to rate until 3g issue is fixed  .

generally disappointed  .

i would be better off with my old school flip phone and a laptop because any reliance you build up to this phone winds up being a setup for disappointment  .

the apps were much more likely to have technical deficiencies than iphone apps i had grow accustomed to  .

the primary problem comes from major parts of the camera just breaking altogether if this phone just had the stamina to not break constantly , i would be really happy with it , i think  .

i am a big fan of google generally , but i will stick to their email and voice services , avoiding their hardware , which seems poorly conceived and poorly manufactured  .

i will be going back to at t and the iphone .

dont buy and you will have to pay 45 to return the crap .

google must not rely on htc to build the hardware  .

it must take control , like apple , to keep quality in check nexus will never ever be an apple killer  .

but windows mobile better watch out but for the blackberry , no phone is wirelessly syncing outlook notes , not even products from the stable of microsoft itself , like microsoft exchange , which is a very sad and frustrating thing for most business users  .

nexus takes the frustraton further by syncing only contacts and mail from exchange  .

what is google thinking  .

there are applications available at android market to fill in this gap  .

but they do not work too well rather than focus on outlook compatibility , google wants us to move away from microsoft and move into its own online applications like google calendar and contacts , for wireless syncing with the phone  .

but a good alternate to outlook notes is still missing in the stables of google applications  .

moreover , a single desktop application to manage and sync contents from the phone to the computer to the internet would be the most useful thing , and would make life of android users much easier .

i think this phone could have potential  .

but as long as other companies are making the body of the phone and the os by another , it will continue to be glitchy and slow to respond to commands the difference to the iphone is the company that programs the operating system also designed the body of the phone itself  .

this is also why the yearly growth rate of pc's is 2  .

8% and macs built by apple grew at an astonishing 16  .

if you do the math , eventually apple and it's mac os x platform will be the predominant computer in use  .

this comes on the heals of microsoft not doing anything to innovate in the space  .

the nexus suffers from the same fate as all ms based pc's , it needs to be built by the same company that programs what it will do in my opinion this phone feels good in the hand but the overall performance is slow , glitchy , (the screen blanks out as you switch programs  .

) its just not half of what the iphone is  .

try again htc  .

you keep coming out with these iphone copies but the patents of the iphone , that protects the iphones unique set of applications updated  .

on jan 25 , 2010  .

i would go with the driod by verizon , never dropped a call .

the phone is nothing compared to the iphone and it does not have that many useful features .

the sound (ie music or speaker phone) is thin or tinny making it hard to understand the person talking  .

the ear piece is hard to hear with the phone up to my ear the software navigation buttons are not intuitive (ie back or settings)  .

it takes two bottons to unlock/wake the phone to use it    iphone and itouch only one  .

compass is not true north no matter how many times i wave my phone in a figure eight phone runs hot to the touch on the back bottom of the phone  .

im worried the protector case i have on order is going to make it worse  .

when you close an app it still keeps running  .

no option to keep on or completely close which runs your battery down fast  .

charged the batter for 8+ hours over night and it is only 3/4 charged  .

the phone ran down in 4hrs the next day  .

may have been a bad batter , i don't know but it never reached 100%  .

this is not a mature product do not waste your money on the first generation of nexus one  .

you will regret it for 550+ if it is available for the itouch price ($199) then it might be worth it  .

maybe version 2 will get it right updated  .

on jun 3 , 2010  .

does not support more than 1 calendar  .

syncs only with gmail based accounts 3  .

does not sync with latest versions of outlook or windows 4  .

workaround (i  .

exporting calendar from outlook and importing into gmail) works but is far too problematic  .

(came up with error of too many deletes , and wouldn't sync  .

then , when i instructed gmail calendar to detlete anyway , it inexplicably sent literally hundreds of invitations to all of the meeting recipients from my calendar from the previous 2 years  .

disaster  .

battery exhausted within less than an hour  .

without even using the phone  .

too many apps open in the background  .

tried appkiller , but this workaround doesn't work either  .

don't be fooled by people that say it does  .

i had to continually kill app's every ten minutes or so because they just keep launching no matter what you do  .

finally , i just started uninstalling everything that was not absolutely necessary  .

that actually helped a little , but not enough 6  .

random execution of apps when launching totally unrelated apps 7  .

sometimes phone will not shut down and freezes at power off  .

resolution   remove battery 8  .

random freezes 9  .

if you go on a trip you have to instruct map where you are    otherwise it doesn't know  .

has a tendency to put you back at your hometown  .

however , gps does seem to know  .

the public transportation route information came up blank for me in washington dc  .

so , that feature seems to be just for show  .

walking map is so slow i found the route myself before the map did  .

gps consumes an enormous amount of battery  .

so , it's not useful unless plugged into a car charger  .

don't install any of the google labs stuff    map overlays , for example , are pretty much useless as they take way too long to load 10  .

interface is overly complex compared to anything , but particularly when compared to iphone 11  .

takes forever to boot up after power off 12 music interface sucks    way too simplistic  .

not enough search options 13  .

sd card is sometimes not readable  .

resolution   power off , remove battery , power back on  .

still , this is scary if you've got a lot of data on it 14  .

phone seems to heat excessively when charging and talking on the phone at the same time  .

also , does not seem to charge well unless completely powered off 15  .

the phone is still in a testing phase and the testers are us , you if buy the phone  .

and if it breaks wow , restocking fee , and if they replace it you get a refurb but still pay the new price  .

thats fair right  .
