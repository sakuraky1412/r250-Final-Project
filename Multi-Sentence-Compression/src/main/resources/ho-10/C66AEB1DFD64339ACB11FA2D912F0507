also they double charged us for breakfast at check in in spite of me telling them it was already paid for , they ran out of milk for the breakfast after nyepi day which was inconvenient and then when they made a mistake with charges on our bill ; this time undercharging us for a massage , instead of emailing and patiently waiting they stalked us to the next hotel and rang and sent telegrams and then turned up in person early one morning after ringing late the previous night .
'' i suffered from stage fright every time i had to use the loo and i like to drink a lot of water so it was a lot of stage fright .
i 've been to bali 6 times though and this is the one hotel i would n't stay at again .
to quote the review below also the `` rooms are very nice but be aware of the awkward configuration of all open concept , shower and bathroom sink are in the room with no wall , so missing some privacy .
if you enjoy dark gothic tiny rooms to hide away in and indoor pools with very little sunlight , in other words if you are an indoors tim burton loving goth - this is the place for you .
well the outdoor pool is 5 minutes away and you have to be escorted buy a staff member to get there .
the gym is located in the spa and honestly ca n't fit more than one person at a time .
weirdly located in the middle of a back road and not so clean .
all up , it was a bit of a ballsup and i would n't go back .
i love cold milk being available , being charged the right amount the first time , my bathroom private and away from my sleeping husband and a gym and pool at the ready .
