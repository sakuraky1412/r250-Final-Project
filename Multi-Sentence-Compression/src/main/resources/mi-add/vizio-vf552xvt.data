not sure about the sound quality  .
haven't used it much , as i am sure most buying in this size are using alternative audio as well  .
tv's all look different to different folk  .
that said , i shopped , studied , and observed different tv's for well over 6 months and honestly , i thought this one is on par if not better than the samsungs and sonys that were out at the time  .
i have had it now for 9 months and still think this is the best bang for ur buck  .
do not write off vizio as the cheap wal    mart alternative  .
the quality is there most of the time .
to get a 55 led 240mhz tv at $1749  .
99 at costco who also extends the factory warranty by a year for free is a no brainer i used to be a home theater snob who had to have the most expensive equipment best name brands and so on  .
i had decided i is going to get the samsung with the same specs but being able to see both sets next to each other made it easy to save the $1 , 200  .
00 more it would of cost for the samsung  .
i have had my plasma samsung for 5 years now and it is starting to die so it is time to change  .
my next tv purchase will be when the 3d tv's do not require the silly glasses .
the bottom    line for me is the price features , no other led/lcd that i looked at had more/better features , or significant picture quality then the vizio vf552xvt for the price , and if you buy it at costco or samsclub you can save even more money .
this tv has an amazing picture and is very easy to install and setup  .
the wireless apps are wonderful and make this model a real deal  .
the remote is well designed and has a nice cool factor with the full qwerty key board  .
i purchased it directly from vizio and had a great experience with their us based sales and customer service  .
using the online purchase they included free shipping a $150 savings , a blu ray player ($200 savings) and a sound bar with wireless sub woofer ($300 saving and dropped the price by almost $400 off of retail  .
try getting that value and quality from any other manufacturer  .
vizio makes a killer product and has the best customer service on the planet .
from the start the vizio customer service is perfect , they were kind , supportive , knowledgeable and friendly  .
they gave me some great info that saved me over $1000 and got me the top of the line tv  .
they threw in at no additional cost , free shipping , free sound bar and wireless sub , and a internet ready bluray player  .
so aside from getting a top of the line 55 wifi enabled led tv with local dimming , i got a killer sound system and bluray player too boot  .
the tv is amazing to watch and filled with great apps  .
the colors and clarity are the best on the market  .
none of the other 55 tv's out there even come close to the picture quality of my vizio even at three times the price i payed  .
i find myself watch programs i could not even care about , just to see how great they look  .
once you add in the killer sound bar and sub    woofer , the place rocks  .
you will be amazed at the quality , value and price you get from vizio  .
i started with the vf552xvt in the media room and had to buy two more of the 37 ones for the bedroom and kitchen  .
vizio is the best not just for the prices , but really the best company and tv .
cannot beat it for price and feature set .
this replaced a year    2000 36 sony xbr which could switch to a 720p display , so we've lived with hd , albeit small screen for awhile  .
we also have a 32 flat panel in the bedroom  .
i'm still learning to watch this one because a 55 widescreen fills a lot more of the field of vision  .
the images are as crisp and clear as program material permits (no blu    ray player yet , ) but i feel that the luminance dynamic range is not as broad as the crt  .
while the blacks are nice with the local dimming , the whites can wash out in bright scenes  .
a crt can be awfully bright  .
on the other hand , a 55 widescreen crt would weigh about a ton  .
this makes a great compromise since i've only lived with the set for two weeks , i have not started fine    tuning  .
i'll give it another 45 days of burn    in before i start changing settings .
people need to stop over spending on names and give vizio a chance it is made in america and the product is awesome for the price you pay  .
i bought my first hdtv nearly ten years ago  .
it is a pain to hook up with a mass of wires and complex antenna adjustment for broadcast reception  .
took hours to set up  .
the vizio vf552 is unpacked , put on the stand and hooked up in about ten minutes  .
i have three direct dvrs and a blueray dvd player  .
just plugged in the hdmi cable and went through the simple start up process  .
even the wireless hookup to my secure router worked the first time  .
i think the remote is reasonably sturdy  .
the remote is light and easy to use  .
i like the input button on the opposite side of the remote from the tv on/off button  .
on an older visio tv , the input button is next to the main on/off switch and i is forever turning the tv off when i wanted to switch inputs one problem with the sharp , bright picture is that you can see set lighting  .
programs such as chuck are so realistic you can tell when they are on a set my wife told me not to mess with the color adjustments  .
i think the as    receive adjustments are a bit too bright with over saturated colors  .
i backed off the settings slightly and i think it looks better  .
trouble is that programs seem to have drastically different color values and saturation (e  .
miami csi seems to be grossly saturated  .
) not the tv's fault the web materials seem to work okay , but i've only gone superficially into them  .
most seem to want to set up subscriptions  .
since i have a direct package , it remains to be seen if any of the web services will be of value to me  .
but if and when something i like is available , this set should have that functionality all in all , i think the vizio vf552 is a great value  .
still trying to learn all the features  .
picture is excellent , set up is very easy .
this t  .
has a lot of bang for the buck  .
the picture quality is better then most lcd's and even looks good sitting next to the bigger name brand led's  .
if you do not require or want one of the real thin t  .
's then this is the best deal out there .
(irealize i should have outlined this before hand i'm kind of all over)  .
ok , its not the tv a millionaire would likely buy to impress his friends  .
but are you and your friends millionaires  .
i finally have one of those tvs i see in the store that makes it look like you're peering into another world not a tv  .
it almost looks 3d when viewing a super modern bluray movie  .
i expected going with a 55 hdtv would totally mess    up my standard definition viewing , but it does a good job of cleaning up artifacts  .
regular analog cable tv looks very viewable  .
the controls are simple and i think the reviewer missed some menus  .
there are more picture controls on this tv than my other three (i checked)  .
i do not notice a green hue at all , and there are a few selectable color enhancers that might be to blame for his comment but i suspect its some super geek problem real people do not face  .
the sony it is sitting next to at costco looked beautiful  .
i could tell the difference between the lg/sony/vizio but i could not really say one is better  .
the black on the lg and sony were blacker , but the artifacts on contrasting colors on the lg were not there at all on the vizio  .
the lg is $300 more than the vizio and the sony is $1500 more and neither had network capability at all , much less wireless 802  .
11n  .
is a no brainer  .
quite happy with it  .
we'll see how it holds up .
first i traded in a samsung pb58550 for this tv  .
the picture on the samsung is amazing but i have a ps3 and image retention is an issue even after 300 hours of break in time  .
i would have to run the scrolling at night for two hours for the picture to be perfect the following day  .
so i found this vizio with locally dimming leds , built in wifi , 240hz , 2000000to 1 contrast ratio , and bluetooth/ir universal remote for $1999 and i is done  .
its a good $1500 less than a comprably equipped sony or samsung  .
the picture on it is great all the features work without a hitch and blurring is not an issue to my surprise  .
i am not to fond of the smooth motion however and as i mentioned it could use a calibration from a pro  .
love the tv  .
if you cant do a plasma for its image retention issues but still want an awesome picture this is your tv .
i got this tv to replace a 3    year old sony rear projection lcd  .
i will tell you that this tv blows that away (even when it is new)  .
although this is a 55 and my sony is a 60 , it doesn't matter  .
the picture quality and features of this tv are well worth the trade    off  .
my remote stop working after 3 months but when i contacted vizio support , they were very helpful and shipped me a new remote out immediately (arrived in about 1 week)  .
i couldn't be happier with this tv (unless it is bigger)  .
some people complain about the silver speaker bars at the bottom  .
they do not bother me  .
if they bother you so much , you can get some speaker grill cloth and cover it i'm sure  .
also , the illuminated logos at the bottom left can be turned off from the settings menu  .
so , all in all , any compaints that i've seen in these reviews , in my opinion , are not my experience  .
this is the best tv i have ever had and it's a much better value for the money than any of the sony's or samsungs  .
i do not see blue tinges as some have reported  .
we plan hook it up to a receiver to improve sound quality .
tv is great picture for good price and allows streaming for $$$ vizio made evil move to remove freedom of user   they disabled network access , they disabled usb ports , they disabled youtube , hulu , and all other non    pay webcontent  .
monthly $$ netfilx is currently the only option with this tv .
ithis is a great tv , and i love it , despite the cons  .
the hd picture is amazing  .
gaming and movies from my ps3 are flawless  .
gow iii , never looked so good  .
m no professional , but i must say the colors are quite accurate and brilliant  .
it also produces deep black levels which is great for reducing blooming  .
however , action scenes may become blurring at time  .
ve yet to make adjustment on the smooth motion effect to see if it  .
s any better  .
ll let it burn in just a little bit more  .
for sound , it  .
s actually pretty good from the sound bar  .
but it  .
s much better coming from a sound system , via fiber optic there are some features on this tv that is a little bothersome , which held me back from giving it a five star  .
standard def (480i) is mediocre ; there are some pixilation in this viewing  .
internet connection , via wi    fi or wired , could be better  .
s not much of a concern to me because i don  .
t use the widgets , but it can be cumbersome when downloading updates  .
and although the remote comes with a slide out keyboard , it feels and looks cheap  .
when you  .
re fighting with your kids for the remote , it  .
s asking to be broken all in all , it  .
s a great tv for the price  .
is going to wait for the pro series , but probably wouldn  .
t be able to afford it  .
almost couldn  .
t afford this one , but i found it at sam  .
s club for $1800+ .
i like it because of its colored and shape most especially its brand updated  .
on apr 20 , 2010  .
i like the remote  .
this is a great value for the features  .
other tv makers charge more for 240 and wi    fi built in is unheard of  .
i am spending more time watching this tv than my 70 sony (with the blue spot)  .
i contacted vizio last week about the availability of the vf552xvt and is told at that time by the sales rep that they were expecting to release it first quarter  .
he encouraged me to sign up for their via vip program online and submit a form for the possiblity to be accepted into their early adopters program i is contacted yesterday and informed that i had , in fact , been selected and that this model had just been released  .
i is offered some very nice discounts as well as an offer for some free merchandise for my participation  .
my tele is scheduled to be shipped this week and i should receive it sometime next week so far , i'm very pleased with vizio's customer service so i'm hoping it continues this way keep a lookout for an updated review in the near future .
i just spoke with vizio today 11/13/09 and they said the release date got pushed back to the 1st or 2nd week in january i'm really disappointed  .
i is looking to make this a fantastic christmas gift looks like plan b is in order .
so vizio believes that the firmware version on the unit    which is a low version even though it is now july 2010    is the reason this won't connect  .
of course the usb ports do not work so there is no way to use those to update but even if they did work vizio is not set up to distribute firmware updates to install in this manner  .
tv has to be connected to the internet and their server has to reach out and find it and then push updated firmware out to it  .
my issue at this time is this the wireless will not connect so the option given is to provide a hardwire connection which means i have to buy my neighbor a case of beer and have him help me tote the unit downstairs (before he drinks the beer if i can) which is the only way to hardwire to my router  .
then i have to leave the unit there until it is detected and the firmware is pushed to it which i am told could take several days and if all good tote back upstairs again (figure this will cost me another case of beer)  .
anyway i moved out of green acres some time back and have not climbed a telephone pole to get a signal out in a while so one would think the smart fellas at vizio would have had this all baked out by now    i do agree with the statement not ready for prime time  .
apps they just added a show time app i wish they had some type of arrangement with content makers to offer cable like packages threw the apps on the television  .
seams to me like that would be a growth area in full force right about now with internet connected televisions .
i find it impossible to adjust individual settings like movie , standard , sport etc for the 4 hdmi inputs i use  .
the moment one setting , like contrast , is changed , that contrast setting number will be the same for all hdmi inputs used , regardless of the preset like movie or custom used and the 3 usb ports are useless , calling vizio to get some idea as to when all of this will be fixed are answered no fw updates planned at this time best pq i ever had in a tv set , would like to keep it very much , just the thought of taking 90 pounds of the wall is scary enough  .
surprised , that my problems did not show up in the review , according to vizio everybody has this problem , is caused in the last fw update updated  .
on apr 19 , 2010  .
final update 04/01/2010   i have to return my vizio due to the constant re    booting , happens a lot when i try to utilize the pip/pop feature and just tonight when i tried to activate the cc when i is using the input for tv  .
vizio tech support has said that this is not normal and wanted to ship a replacement but i said no because   1) weird side panel which vizio now admits they will be correcting in a re    design of the exterior housing by late spring 2010 or early summer 2010 ; 2) the very unlit remote with too few special feature buttons and poor spacing between the buttons ; 3) tech support unable to say when or if the usb ports will ever be turned on  .
; 4) tech support also said the use of led back lighting is the reason for the poor on    screen space utilization when the pip/pop feature is on  .
tech support said this will be resolved in the pro series which they say will have more led zones to allow for better on    screen space utilization when pop is activated updated review 03/08/2010   since the review below i would like to add some updates for those interested  .
one reviewer stated something about stains/shadows in the right corners but i could not find any on my unit nor the 4 shadow that from the reviewer's description would run diagonally across the screen  .
i am looking but nothing  .
i still rate the picture a 5 and the audio a solid 4 but the remote though is just too difficult to use in the dark or even in low lighting situations  .
given vizio's design for the remote to replace your other remotes it is not useful as that due to lack of a glow button  .
the remote is still good but only for part of the day and again the remote still is lacking many dedicated special feature buttons my biggest concern though is the tv locking up and re    booting which it seems to do more frequently when i utilized the pip/pop feature  .
i have a call in to vizio and several e    mails and they are currently researching the issue  .
i think for the price the tv is a great bargain and while i am no videophile/audiophile i think again for this price range the quality of the audio/video is excellent but they do need to fix certain issues  .
the re    booting , the missing glow and extra feature buttons on the remote , the side panel toggle switch functions , turning on all the usb ports , and the pip/pop to better utilize the screen space and fix the audio shutting off from the main screen when you turn off the pip/pop  .
the via apps rock and really make the tv a joy to use , i hope they add youtube soon like other reviewers , myself included   be wary of the reviews on the vizio site updated  .
on apr 23 , 2010  .
first (before i get flayed by the readership) i love vizio products  .
s'matter of fact , i sold my vizio 551 after only 4 months of owning it to purchase this unit in the hopes of getting the latest and greatest  .
sadly , outside of picture quality , it is a step down in almost every other regard first the remote  .
maybe i is spoiled by the beautifully designed remote from the 551  .
great looks , backlit keys , good tactile feedback it had everything that the remote on the 552 lacks  .
start with appearance   it literally looks like a prototype  .
cheap black plastic with tiny black rubber keys i have remotes from $29 dvd players that are better looking  .
and from a functional standpoint , it commits the 3 cardinal sins of bad remote control design   1) no backlighting of any of the keys forget about using it without lights blazing  .
kinda ruins the theater experience 2) keys provides tactile feedback without executing their function this means you'll press the chnl up key , feel the indent beneath your finger and you'll still be watching the same channel you were  .
3) tiny tiny keys unless you're an elf , you'll be fat    fingering  .
it's just a bad design  .
i sincerely hope vizio provides all of their early    adopters (like me) with a free replacement of the newly designed remote when it's available (and they will redesign this , as this device has no place with their flagship set) next , the usb ports they don't work  .
it says so right in the manual (though not in any of vizio's promotional literature)  .
i loved the single usb port on my 551 plug in a thumbdrive with pictures and music and you had your own custom slideshow  .
cannot do it on my new tv  .
tech support says they'll be a future firmware upgrade to fix 'em i ain't holding my breath another item that'll be fixed with a future firmware upgrade is the ability to turn off the backlighting behind the annoying tech logo on the bottom left    hand corner of the set beneath the screen (another menu function my 551 is able to perform that the 552 cannot)  .
here you have a six inch long , 1 inch tall feature list (i  .
via led lcd 240 hz 1080p and other stuff) backlit by bright white leds again really annoying when in a darkened setting  .
until the fix comes in , i have a piece of black electrical tape covering them up on the front of my $2000 tv irritating onto the newtwork connectivity , the reason i bought the set   at this point , i'd say it's working to vizio's advantage more than mine  .
it gives them a method to 'upgrade' the product with automatic firmware updates , which is great  .
but it also gave them latitude to introduce something that clearly ai not quite baked yet  .
the widgets are 'cute' , but (at this stage) they're nothing that you cannot get from a feature    laden bluray player with networking you may think this critique is nitpicking , but keep in mind that i is expecting an upgrade from my 551 having said all that , it's still the best bang for your lcd buck  .
but if you're a current owner of a 551 , there's no compelling reason to make the switch just yet  .
i rated this tv (the 552 in its current state) a 3 outta 5 stars  .
if vizio fixes these issues and brings it up to par with the 551 it replaced , it'll be a solid 4 hope this helps in your buying decision (and in getting me a new remote anyone from vizio reading this  .
; )  .
updated  .
on apr 20 , 2010  .
the plain non    swing mount only gives an inch between the back and the wall  .
even the power and cable cords had to be attached before the mounting act ; and bent sharply , which seems to work ok at least at first incredibly stupid design  .
why not put them on the side like others are  .
am keeping it because i got my 550xvt for $1750 at wallmart and i only use the cable and power connections , so far no earphone outlet .
Via Apps. 802.11n dual-band networking. QWERTY keyboard Bluetooth remote; Having to wait to get mine :)
PICTURE, ENERGY USE, REMOTE, PRICE; Won't play movies directly off my hard drive. Might be a firmware issue or update.
simple to install and operate, well thought out designs, amazing color and sharpness, no pixel slop at high speed. Great internal apps. Vizio Customer service IS THE BEST. They are kind, smart and helpful.; I didn't order one sooner
simple, seamless, wireless streaming video from the major $$ players. whites :O makes laptop screen look dull. blacks absolute localdimming on. non-reflective screen! in contrast, samsungs are mirrors. bluetooth remote(works pointing in any direction); purposely denied connection to local network pcs, harddrives ,evil!. no free streaming web video either...purposely evil!.... no youtube, no hulu, etc.. usb ports purposely disabled ... evil anti-consumer move to force you thru expensive services
Great features and clarity with, no competitors at current price level.; Silver sound bar take away from a sleek look
Picture quality, Netflix, universal remote.; USB ports still not activated, impossible to set individual parameters like contrast or sharpness for the 4 HDMI inputs, regardless of picture mode chosen.
Great picture, lots of wireless apps, great price, awesome US based customer service; There is not a single negative with Vizio
All is excellent, except the cons below. Otherwise 5 stars.; The connections are on the back. OK if your mount lets you swing it out, which is a much more expensive mount, otherwise how do you connect if you put it on a wall?
love the apps..picture and style of the television i have a 42 inch.; remote seams a bit crammed.
Very sharp, bright, clear picture. Love the Cinema Smooth feature....makes things look more realistic! Great price at Sam's Club. Good customer service.; Remote broke after 3 months but Vizio support was very responsive and sent me a brand new one within a week.
The VF522 does everything as advertised! It has a bright, sharp picture that practically jumps out at you. The set up was flawless; even the wireless internet connection worked on the first try.; It seems like most of the web-based services involve fees. (Not the tv's fault!)
Easy to remove base. Easy to setup wi-fi. The picture has a wow factor of 10. Sound is good.; What's with the silver sound bar? Please make a black cover to mute the bar when room is dark for viewing. Make it optional. Can't find codes for Direct tv remote.
Great Picture - absolutely the most bang for the $$$ of any 50in+ LCD. Easy Device and Network Setup. Friendly Knowledgeable Tech Support (save some time and ask for a Level 3 tech); In its current form, a step down from the Vizio 551. Non-functional USB ports ? ! ?. Cheesy Remote Control. Cannot turn-off the distracting backlit Tech Logo on the front of the TV
Beautiful display with lots of presets. There's Baseball, Basketball, Football, Cinema, Normal, etc. presets which appear to be tweaked slightly for each mode. Nice touch.; I have large hands and fingers and the bluetooth remote is difficult to use as a keypad.
Great picture, wifi works great, bluetooth universal remote works very well, local dimming leds wow, Netflix is awesome to stream, for a flat panel tv speakers are pretty good.; Thicker than the samsungs and sonys, Remote could be backlit. Needs a CNET review to get an accurate calibration. the VF551xvt is not the same.
Everything from price to picture. 240 hz so it will work well with Playstation3 blue ray (and does, awesomely). All the ports you could probably want. Black is finally black. Something with which vizio has been struggling.; Its not quite tv of those twice its price; not as fashionable as some korean competitors. Apps is a work in progress. Teaming with Yahoo is a bone-head maneuver waste of time, but has netflix. Its obvious the styling is a sino/american cluster F***
Fantastic picture no blurring, Matte screen reduces glare, WiFi setup automatically, Remote controls most functions of SA cable box. Good picture from side. Uses about 150W power. Deeper/richer blacks than most.; Remote very small and needs a back light, Sound needs improvement like most LED/LCDs, Heavy for an LCD (about 90 lbs), Not as thin as other models, Annoying lighted logo on left side under the screen (but figured out how to turn it off)
Great picture and above average sound. Great apps/widgets and much easier to get acess than to have to turn on a second separate device. Nice black levels, love the clarity and picture bightness.; Poor remote feel. Too few special feature buttons on the remote. Picture Outside Picture screens are too small given size of this TV. No USB ports turned on. Re-boots when using some of the VIA widgets or adjusting TV settins or changing TV inputs
This is my first excursion into the land of big screen TV and it has met my initial expectations in regards to it's function as a TV. Was finally able to find one of these at a local Costco several weeks ago; Can't seem to get the wireless connectivity to go - even after working with tech support via email and over the phone - will not connect. Had to make sure WPA was enabled and also had to ensure password was alpha characters only per tech support.
Better features then comparable 55" LED LCD TV on the market, w/typical savings of $1,100. You could afford two for the price of 1 SAMSUNG or SONY. Best of all, true WIFI internet w/QWERTY keyboard built-in to remote, makes watching NETFLIX a breeze!; The Vizio VF552XVT is almost double the thickness and is a bit heavier then comparable LED/LCD TV's, but if you purchase a decent quality wall mount you wont notice it at all.
Great Picture....Easy to program...Remote works fine and I have very large hands and fingers. The Tech Logo on our unit turns off rather easily. I do admit it is annoying when it was on but no big deal just turn it off!!!!!; Nothing so far only had it a couple days but will return if any issues.. Now my wife and kids not only hog the computer but now I get home from work and the kids are on Facebook(Is the Devil) on the TV too..................LOL
This T.V has a great picture even when you see it next to the competition . The internet apps like Pandora or Netflix are great.Very easy to set up.Bluetooth remote with built in slider keyboard.; I don't care for the non removable speaker bar and it would be nice if it came with a swivel stand(though this is not a issue for me because I mounted it on a stand)
