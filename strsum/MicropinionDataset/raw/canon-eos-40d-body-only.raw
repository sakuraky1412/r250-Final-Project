Pros:. Great IQ,fast,excellent at higher iso,uses Canon's L lenses. 
Cons:. Higher res lcd would be nice. 
Summary:. A Best Buy in it's class.The image quality is better than the twice the cost D300.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything you would expect from Canon. 
Cons:. Size / Weight. 
Summary:. I have owned this camera for a couple of months, and I think that the "testers" at cnet need their heads examined. The low light ability of this camera is phenomenal. I would ask the national Canon rep to stop by your offices with a different camera for a demonstration of it's abilities. You must be kidding! My preference is to never use a flash unless I absolutely have to. I have been able to capture some very stunning images indoors and out under low light conditions. My only wish is that I could stick it in my pocket and carry it all of the time, because I would...... 

$$;
Pros:. AF, frame buffer, burst, LiveView, excellent image quality. 
Cons:. The burst slow down with older lenses like the 50mm F1.8 In AI servo. 
Summary:. I do birds and wildlife and a lot and needed a camera that could have the AF performance very robust in AI servo and the 40D delivers. It AF well with a non reporting teleconverter like the Tamron 1.4x and my 400mm F5.6 L.. So far I don't seen any negative except one, which would be that the burst rate slow down to about 4 or 5fps when using it with AI servo and a lens like 50mm F1.8. So the burst rate in AI servo is directly dependant on the AF speed of the lens.. Despite this, I gave it a 10 because it's not really the camera fault if a lens is slow to AF. I rather have the burst slow down a bit if the lens can't keep up than having a lot of frames out of focus.. I was using the 20D before and this one is a major step above the 20D in term of speed and AF precision.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent IQ, Fast FPS, Viewfinder, LCD, too many to mention. 
Cons:. There really are none.. 
Summary:. For those familiar with the xxD series of Canon DSLR cameras, Canon made a wide range of improvements on the 40D to bring this camera up to a new level. Everything from Image IQ (Image Quality), Canon's Famous Hi ISO low noise, speed and acuracy. They even madeimprovements in areas that some thought were a little weak in their prevois 10D/20D/30D cameras like better AF, ISO in the viewfinder, 3" LCD etc.. This is a list of new features and upgrades from the 20D-30D and 30D-40D differences.For those that are considering an upgrade from the previous xxD series cameras, it shows what the differences are and each person can judge for themselves what is or is not important to them and whether it pays to upgrade. I personally upgraded from the 20D.. 1. Revised body and control layout.. 2. 10 MP CMOS sensor.. 3. EOS Integrated Cleaning System.. 4. DIGIC III Image Processor.. 5. 14-bit ADC.. 6. 5FPS increase to 6.5 FPS shooting speed.. 7. Larger buffer.. 8. Larger, brighter viewfinder.. 9.

Whereas 20D to 30D had.... 01. Metering modes added Spot (3.5% at center).. 02. ISO steps 0.3 EV steps 1.0 EV steps. 03. Added Image "Picture Style". 04. Custom image parameters - greater range +-4 rather than +-2. 05. LCD 2.5" 230,000 pixels vs 1.8" 118,000 pixels LCD. 06. Histogram added RGB (minor). 07. Continuous speed added 3 frames per second choice. 08. Continuous buffer Up to 30 JPEG/11 RAW vs Up to 23 JPEG/6 RAW. 09. Playback file size display Yes, MB vs No. 10.

Really not offering much which is why so many people did not upgrade from 20D-30D.. Go to your local store and tryout the 40D. You won't be sorry. 

$$;
Pros:. Large Grip, Large LCD, Clear View Finder, Manageable Noise, Fast Responsive Auto Focus, 6 FPS. 
Cons:. LCD Is Mediocre, Top LCD Buttons Are a Bit too far to reach. 
Summary:. First Impressions. I love this camera so much, its so much fun an easy to use. Once you get used to the controls (or if you've used previous models) its really easy to use. The large grip makes it easy to hold and feels better in the hands, especially when I am use heavy lenses like the 70-200mm f/2.8 it feels like it balances the weight very well.. Imagine Quality-. Its pretty sharp and nice color saturation, though I would like to see my colors more punchy without having to adjust my settings in Standard. The noise on this camera is kept very well in check with very little noise up to 1000 ISO. And even usable pictures at 3200ISO (with a little noise reduction software).. Body -. It feels really comfortable and does not feel hard to hold. Ergonomics and cosmetics on this body are wonderful, sleek black body and feels very sturdy. Only nitpick i can think of is the placement of the buttons on the top LCD. The last button is just a tad to far for my index finger to reach without loosening my grip on the camera with my right hand.. Features -. 6FPS, wow. It captures things I could never capture with my XTi in burst mode. Its amazing how it sounds, I love it. Anyways besides the fast shutter speed, another feature it has is the Live View. I personally have only used it twice? Its not very practical for me but if your doing macro you can zoom in on any part of the picture and finely tune the focus with your manuel focus.. Conclusion -. Its an amazing piece of equipment I know that I will use a lot in the years to come!. 

$$;
Pros:. very accurate af, smooth noiseless images even at high ISO. 
Cons:. bulky and it is on the heavy side.. 
Summary:. I brought it to my daughter's graduation. I was able to get great images even in very challenging lighting conditions. Focus is on the spot and I was able to get great images even in subdued lighting.. 

$$;
Pros:. Highlight Tone Priority, 14 bit, Live view nice for studio, optional sRAW for minimum CF, Integrated Cleaning System, Larger 3" LCD &#38; nice handling. 
Cons:. Poor automatic white balance, only 10mp better 12 mp. 
Summary:. Buy &#38; try it, nice shoot, beautiful tone, better noise in high iso - highly recomended for first DSLR or second body. 

$$;
Pros:. Processing speed, power, balanced weight. 
Cons:. poor lens options as kit,. 
Summary:. Sorry Lori - You refer to the lens included in your review as the 28-135 lens - fact is that your handling an "L" series lens (probably the 17-40mm) which is a great choice but unfortunately not included.. Had my 40D for a month and have around 2000 pics through her. I shoot action shots and the fast shooting rate is appreciated. Also the ability to scroll through dozens of pics with the spin of the wheel is a real treat (compared to some of the past cameras I have had where it takes a second or two per image).. Battery life is very good - even with included flash.. As my first DSLR I was thrown off by the 1.6X magnification factor. I went with the 28-135 which gives you a lens that is more like 55-210mm which was of little value to me. I added the 17-40mm "L" along with the 35-350 "L" which both flaunt the capabilities of the image quality more than the stock lens.. Colors are superb, quality of image is impressive. Zero complaints about the quality of the camera, design, functionality, or performance.. While this camera is rated for 100 000 images I can see that number coming and going in no time.. Do yourself a favor and spend some money and get a quality card. I went with 16gb and can fill that in a few hours of action shooting.. 

$$;
Pros:. LCD size, cost, handling, lightness and action snaps. 
Cons:. On a step up from the XT, the learning curve is high!. 
Summary:. It feels like a real Professional Grade camera and the results are fantastic. I have used the smaller and lighter Canon XT for two years and love the camera, and the images it captures are great. Now with the 40D I feel like a pro and the camera is so fast and acts like a Pros, so it is a Prosumer's Delight.. I think it is a logical and nice step up from the Canon XT/XTi but the added weight and size will be noticeable at first.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to hold, fast focus, good exposure, dust delete, weather seal, And great pictures. 
Cons:. No cover for hotshoe, LCD resolution 230K only.. 
Summary:. This is a beautiful camera. I love using it. The camera feels right in my hands. The buttons, and user interface is great. I can access all features very easily. Love the joystick and jump buttons.. It takes good pictures. I love the colours, and my pictures turns out well exposed in all kinds of lighting and situation. White balance is great.. With weather seals, with most of my lenses, it offers reasonable protection against dust and elements.. My grievance with DSLR was dust specs ruining my beautiful sky pictures. So the dust delete and sensor clean helps I guess. It is still new so dont really know how effective the sensor clean function will be.. The negatives i can see are - the cam was made weather seal and then Canon does not provide a cap for the hotshoe. This defeat the purpose of putting weather seals in other areas and leaving hotshoe with electrical contact open. Imagine water and electrical contacts. Coming from Nikon camp earlier, the D80 came with a good hotshoe cap.. The other thing i guess i feel a bit pain is the LCD resolution. Nothing wrong with 230K as it displays images perfect on the 3inch screen. Just that everyone else goes very high res and once you see your friends high res LCD, you feel the pain.. All said and done - I really enjoy this cam. It is really a great cam and has already made me happy with some great pictures.. BTW - the reviewer says it is slow as compared to D80. Having used both, I will say no comparison. Different class altogether. I dont think 40D is slow. It focuses super. maybe start up time is slightly slow, but then there is a the fast focus and shutter which in my opinion got me emergency pics when i wanted. 

$$;
Pros:. Does everything you can get out of a camera.. 
Cons:. Glad it has auto while I learn to use all it has to offer.. 
Summary:. First really good camera and finding I need a lot knowledge that I dont have.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast, easy to use, better menu system. 
Cons:. Screen detail could be better. 
Summary:. I've owned Canon cameras since using the F-1 in the Army. I have a D60, a 20D and have used the 10D, and 30D. The 40D is the best of these. The only thing I would like to add to this is to increase the frame rate to eight frames per second. Although I have use this camera to shoot about 500 photos I have not really gave it a workout, to where I find something I don't like about it. The one thing I like about it is, it is quiet, many Canon wedding photographers will really like this camera. It is a mini 5D, yet it is fast enough for most sport photography. My only peeve is that I think the LCD resolution could be better. However I like the zoom view feature to check focus. It seems to be better executed on the 40D than on other XXD cameras. Other features have been fully explained in some of the other reviews so I won't elborate. I'll just say I highly recommend this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great images with low noise, fast and accurate AF, well built. 
Cons:. None at this time. 
Summary:. I wanted to upgrade from my Canon Rebel XT which is a very good beginner dSLR. But I wanted something that is faster with great images even at high ISO.. This camera feels like a dSLR while the Rebel XT seemed a little too small and very plastiky. The AF is very good even at low light and much faster than the Rebel XT. Also I can now take images at 1/3 ISO stops. The images are also less grainy / noisy even at 1250 / 1600 ISO. This camera also has some great features found in the 1D Mark III including 3" Liveview LCD, Auto Sensor Cleaning. Finally, this camera is extremely responsive from start up to taking a shot - max 6.5 fps is much faster than the Rebel XT.. I also find that the images are either properly exposed / maybe sometimes a little over-exposed. But my Rebel XT seemed to under-expose most images. The images from the 40D are sharp with great colours and detail.. I highly recommend this semi-pro camera. Great value for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image Quality, Live View, Dust prevention, Speed. 
Cons:. LCD preview not accurate. 
Summary:. Overall this camera is great in every respect. All the new features in 40D makes it a worthwhile upgrade from xxD series. Speed, custom functions, Live view, Dust prevention, constuction are build quality are great. Larger LCD is great but I wish the camera displayed a high resolution of the picture when magnified to check the focus. At full magnification pictures look fuzzy. I hope Canon fixes this in the upcoming firmware releases.. 

$$;
Pros:. Much better image &#38; build quality than before.. 
Cons:. Still no EF-S lens weatherproof sealing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, accuracy, and ease of use. 
Cons:. Wish the image size was larger than 10 megapixels. 
Summary:. This is my first DSLR that I've owned. I've used several of my friends DSLR's over the last 2 years so I know what to expect. The camera allows you to control everything or nothing at all. The software that comes with it is okay, but what do you expect for free. The quality of the images is just OUTSTANDING. The only reason I didn't give this a 10 is due to the 10 megapizel image size. If it was 12....this would be the best camera in the world.. 

$$;
Pros:. Autocleaning sensor,live LCD view. 
Cons:. too noisy,only 10 megapixels,always canon behind Nikon. 
Summary:. I upgraded from the 30D to the 40D,to be honest, I went to the camera store to buy another 30D (was almost 40% off,from the original price)but they were gone! I started playing with the 40D and like it a lot,what a surprise when I star shooting at home, what terrible noise when you press down the shutter, foget it,when you pop up the flash, but at the end I liked the high quality of the picture, and the thats it the most important. 

$$;
Pros:. Absolutely everything. 
Cons:. Spot meter could have been tighter; LiveView is a waste of time - but thats a personal preference. 
Summary:. Except for the spot meter being slightly wooly, could not find fault with it in the last 15 days that I have had it. Any person using an SLR would be deemed to be serious about their photography. And any serious photographer will tell you, using LCD to focus (with attendant camera shakes; washed out appearance in bright sunlight etc. etc...)is not the best way of doing it. If you HAD to put the liveview maybe giving a swivel LCD (to facilitate shooting around corners/over the crowds) would have made more sense to the Photojournalist. But..as I said thats a personal choice, and there will be lots of LiveView fans out there. The wide spot meter (even wider than 30D)is the only aspect which prevents me from giving this beauty a perfect 10.. 

$$;
Pros:. ALOT of camera for your money. 
Cons:. Canon needs to built a better strap. 
Summary:. I believe the CNET folks rated this camera while using the 28-135 kit. Your camera is only as good as the lens.. The camera focuses immediately with a fast lens attached (2.8 or lower) Upgraded from a rebel xt. I always wanted a camera that acted and felt like my film camera EOS-3, well now I got it! Solid build, feels good in your hands, lots of modes and custom settings. VERY bright viewfinder that is comparable to analog cameras or full frame digital.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, great low light ability, Familiar layout. 
Cons:. none found so far. 
Summary:. I purchased a D60 when it was available for twice the money. This camera is many times better than the D60 and a better price. Very pleased with everything so far. I use it for sports, scenics, and wildlife.. 

$$;
Pros:. Metal body, sensor cleaning. 
Cons:. Relocated LCD is clumsy to use at times.. 
Summary:. I've had mine for about a week now and it's simply a joy to handle. I've owned a Digital Rebel for several years waiting for the right combination of features and price before I upgraded, and I certainly don't reget it. The camera is quick and responsive, with a solid feel. Did run into a few issues with getting correct focus lock in lower light situations, but the focus is fast enough it's simple to reset it quickly before shooting. Only minor complaint is that that LCD was moved to the top of the camera, and when you're shooting with a 100-400 fully extended it's a pain to shift the camera around to check something there. Like I said, minor complaint easily dealt with because of the features available.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just what I was waiting for!. 
Cons:. None that affect my type of shooting.. 
Summary:. I've had an EOS 20D for sometime. When the 30D came out, I took a look at it. I was disappointed because the improvements weren't much over the 20D. I think Canon wasted their time with the introduction of the 30D.. When the 40D came out, it was what I was hoping for. I have an EOS XTi, but it's just to compact for my grip. I will keep the XTi as a back-up, but will probably put my 20D on eBay.. The things that sold me on the 40D was the size, compatibility with all my Canon EOS equipment, the 3" screen, higher megapixel rating, and the sensor cleaning system. I'm using the battery grip that I had on my 20D, so I didn't have to fork over another 200 bucks for a new one like I did when upgrading from a Digital Rebel to a Rebel XTi.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, and easy to use, and works will all my old accessories!.. 
Cons:. Price is High, but better than the origanal 30D price.. 
Summary:. I upgraded from the original EOS Digital Rebel, and what an improvement! I have had the camera only one week and still learning many of the neat new features.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well priced plus easy to use. 
Cons:. Its slower and its pictures are not as good as Canons. 
Summary:. picture quality is amazing I. Samantha Geller. www.Aafter.com. 

$$;
Pros:. Great images, accurate colors, control etc. 
Cons:. Weather sealing. 
Summary:. I really do like the 40D a lot but sometimes I'm afraid the weather might hurt the camera. I have this and a 30D and I'm not confident in shooting in rainy or dusty situations. Other than that, it's a fine camera. Looking at a 5D for the studio.. 

$$;
Pros:. IMAGES TO MY LIKING,COMPARED TO D80. 
Cons:. LCD SCREEN DOES'NT REP. IMAGE WELL. 
Summary:. The Canon 40D has a great quality feel,produces an image I like compared to the Nikon D80,has a softness to the image that's constant and produces a constant background also.Where the D80 was a little more sharper on the subject,but did'nt seem the same,exact sharpness all over the focus area.My eyes enjoy that overall solid softness to the 40D.I'm eager to use with L series Lense's.I have kit 28-135 and purchased a seperate EF 70-300mm 1:4-5:6IS USM lense.. I find the 28-135 lense supplied with 40D o be a great,overall lense.The IS works great.The $650.00 70-300 is similar but does require more steadiness even with the 2 stage IS feature.. I can't rely totally on the LCD screen for any slight defects to images,I wish it had a better LCD screen resolution (or whatever it would be) to display images to near perfect representation of image,if so it would rate a close 10 for me!. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid build, speed, size of rear LCD. 
Cons:. Location of ON/Off switch. 
Summary:. I've upgraded form a 350D &#38; love the solid feel, larger, brighter viewfinder, the custom functions &#38; the high speed for sports.. ONLY minor niggle is I find the On/Off switch on the 350D faster to use, rather than the 20/30/40D location ... pretty minor niggle really.. 

$$;
Pros:. -----------. 
Cons:. -----------. 
Summary:. The reviewer in the video clip decribed the lens as a 28-135mm attached to the camera she was reviewing. The lens she was handling is in fact a Canon L lens (due to the red ring on the front of the lens) and not the 28-135..
